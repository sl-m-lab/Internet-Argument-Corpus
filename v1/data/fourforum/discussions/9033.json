   "Richard Dawkins:\n \n  I use the word \"scare\" because, to be painfully honest, I can think of few things that would more devastate my world view than a demonstrated need to return to the theory of evolution that is traditionally attributed to lamarck. It is one of the few contingencies for which I might offer to eat my hat. Richard Dawkins, The Extended Phenotype.\n \n Lamarckism, of course is the antithesis of Darwinism. While Lamarckism says that there is a cooperative interaction between organisms and their enviornment - which enables them and their offspring to survive, Darwinism says that there is no such cooperation....that organisms' traits must arise randomly - only to be later selected according to how well they fit into a given enviornment. Their central dogma is that genetic changes are only to arise by dumb chance.\n \n Lamarck has been ridiculed to no end by evolutionists during the past century. His name seems to strike a raw nerve, which prompts profuse sweating, scoffing and laughing. Many evolutionists do not even give Lamarck - or his theory - a mention. They certainly do not present lamarck's real views - instead they construct a strawman argument:\n \n August Weismann, a dishonest German evolutionary biologist was successful in constructing the strawman of all strawmen....and this strawman has been repeated endlessly by evolutionists - which helped destroy Lamarck's reputation. What Weissmann did was cut off the tails of male and female mice - then he bred them. Weismann argued that if Lamarck's theory were correct, the parents should pass on their tail-less state to future generations. Predictably, none of the offspring ever emerged tail-less, despite 21 generations of experiments.\n \n But this was not a true test of lamarck's theory. Weismann was being scientifically dishonest. See, Lamarck never argued that every change in an animal would take hold. Instead, what he argued was that animals would retain or gain new traits when they needed them to survive. Lamarck believed that only modifications produced by an animal's internal response to the environment would be inherited. Weismann evidently didn't think that the mice needed tails - but, of course, he didn't ask the mice what they thought.\n \n Check out this quote from Darwin:\n \n \"In my opinion, the greatest error which I have committed has been not allowing sufficient weight to the direct action of the environments, i.e. food, climate, etc., independently of natural selection...When I wrote \"Origin,\" and for some years afterwards, I could find little good evidence of the direct action of the environment; now there is a large body of evidence.\"\n \n So, evolutionsts...please answer me - where has this 'body of evidence' gone in the last 100 years? Did it disappear like magic? Why is it swept under the rug? Why do evolutionists, to this very day, REFUSE to a test the concept that the environment and the organism work in harmony? Does it not strike any of you odd that there are no, none, zip, nada tests on animals that can verify or confirm your \"science\" that says our genes live with a chastity belt around them? I mean a scientist could very easily take a colony of bugs and change the enviornment drastically to see what happens. Will selection kick in? Will the bugs change physical characteristics on-the-fly? Will their offspring emerge with new traits? What are these silly scientists afraid of? Why must they bash Lamarck, yet not have the manhood to prove him wrong? Must they be just as Dishonest as Weismann was when he cut the tails of the mice? Is that how science works?....just lay low, play dumb, and hope nobody notices??? What kind of nonsense is that? Where are these tests???...for gosh sakes?????\n \n And that laughable character, Weismann, is the dude who got on his high horse and officially proclaimed the forbiddance of the flow of genetic information from body cells and germ cells, sperm and eggs.....which forbids the inheritance of acquired characteristics. And evidently that's all it took for those elitist scientists at Harvard and Oxford Universities to proclaim that Lamarck was the king of the XXXXXX. But of course, Weismann, being the dishonest person who conducted the faulty experiments on the mice, also is proven to be faulty in his declaration known as \"Weismann's Barrier.\" \n \n And for decades, evolutionist fools proclaimed they had decoded the Book of Life....they said that individual genes controlled individual traits. Well all that came to a crashing halt when the Human Genome Project showed that the one-gene/one-phenotype concept was indeed a fairytale. Instead, to the shock and dismay of teary-eyed evolutionists, they found that the human genome only has about 25,000 genes - over 100,000 short of their estimate. This meant their theory about how they thought life worked had to be scrapped. Of course among other things, it showed everyone that all those trillions of dollars pumped into biotech were a big waste of money because it was now it's impossible to expect genetic engineers to cure all our diseases by fixing our genes - not only are individual genes not necessarily responsible for individual traits, but there simply are not enough genes to account for the incredible complexity of the human body. Not only that, but scientists could no longer say that it was our genes that made us different than other animal....it turns out that humans have the same number of genes as many primitive organisms! In otherwords -- the past 100 years of science have been a giant waste of time!\n \n But was this pronounced on CNN? Heck no! The media kooks just plays dumb like they always do.....and this is so society will stay successfully dumbed down. But if everything was on the up and up, scientists would admit that it's not our genes, but our BRAIN - our miraculous, God-given brain - that controls our physiology and behavior. Through our brain, environmental influences, including nutrition, stress, and emotions can not only modify genes -- but they can pass these genetic changes to future generations...as epigenetics proves.\n \n Ultimately, I believe that our physical body is effected by our brain - more specifically our mind. Our thought patterns, including stress and emotions directly influence the body's physiology. Evolutionists hate talking about the mind - and that's because they cannot explain it. And since they can't explain it, they just simply ignore it....and then, once the brain is successfully swept under the carptet, they attempt to explain life without the incorporating the mind! It's a sham forced down our throats by an elitist community of quacks who pass themselves off as scienitsts. And their sham has tricked millions into believing that the body has control over the mind instead of the mind having control over the body.\n \n \"In recent years, molecular biology has shown that the genome is far more fluid and responsive to the environment than previously supposed. It has also shown that information can be transmitted to descendants in ways other than through the base seqeunce of DNA.\" (Jablonka and Lamb 1995.)",

   "Lamarckism, of course is the antithesis of Darwinism. \n\n Both ideas propose mechanisms for one set of evidence: the evidence that populations and species change. Antithesis? I doubt it.\n \nWhile Lamarckism says that there is a cooperative interaction between organisms and their enviornment - which enables them and their offspring to survive, \n\n Lamarckism states that characteristics aquired during a lifetime can be passed on to offspring.\n \nDarwinism says that there is no such cooperation....that organisms' traits must arise randomly - only to be later selected according to how well they fit into a given enviornment. \n\n Actually, selection occurs by differential reproductive rates. What this means is that organisms which reproduce more will have more offspring than the others (obviously). Therefore, traits that help organisms reproduce will become more prevailant.\n \nTheir central dogma is that genetic changes are only to arise by dumb chance.\n\n Dogma? Are you trying to imply that the ToE is based on faith and not facts?\n \nHis name seems to strike a raw nerve, which prompts profuse sweating, scoffing and laughing. \n\n More like, his theory is dismissed because of the evidence.\n \nMany evolutionists do not even give Lamarck - or his theory - a mention. \n\n It is irrelevant. Do you hear people talk about an earth-centered solar system?\n \nBut this was not a true test of lamarck's theory. Weismann was being scientifically dishonest. See, Lamarck never argued that every change in an animal would take hold. \n\n Lamarckism states that characteristics aquired during a lifetime can be passed on to offspring. Look it up.\n \nInstead, what he argued was that animals would retain or gain new traits when they needed them to survive. Lamarck believed that only modifications produced by an animal's internal response to the environment would be inherited. \n\n Evidence? Source?\n \nCheck out this quote from Darwin:\n \n \"In my opinion, the greatest error which I have committed has been not allowing sufficient weight to the direct action of the environments, i.e. food, climate, etc., independently of natural selection...When I wrote \"Origin,\" and for some years afterwards, I could find little good evidence of the direct action of the environment; now there is a large body of evidence.\"\n\n Source? I expect that that is a quote mine, though it only vaguely relates to your point.\n \nSo, evolutionsts...please answer me - where has this 'body of evidence' gone in the last 100 years? Did it disappear like magic? Why is it swept under the rug? Why do evolutionists, to this very day, REFUSE to a test the concept that the environment and the organism work in harmony? \n\n An out-of-context quote is supposed to make your point? Darwin certainly wasn't attempting to support Lamarckism...\n \nDoes it not strike any of you odd that there are no, none, zip, nada tests on animals that can verify or confirm your \"science\" that says our genes live with a chastity belt around them? \n\n There is a large amount of evidence for the theory of evolution. A \"chastity belt\" is irrelevant.\n \nI mean a scientist could very easily take a colony of bugs and change the enviornment drastically to see what happens. Will selection kick in? Will the bugs change physical characteristics on-the-fly? Will their offspring emerge with new traits? What are these silly scientists afraid of? \n\n It has been done with bacteria, flies, moths, etc. Look it up.\n \nWhy must they bash Lamarck, yet not have the manhood to prove him wrong? Must they be just as Dishonest as Weismann was when he cut the tails of the mice? Is that how science works?....just lay low, play dumb, and hope nobody notices??? What kind of nonsense is that? Where are these tests???...for gosh sakes?????\n\n There are many tests that support evolution. Lamarckism, however, has yet to aquire compelling evidence. Lamarck asserted that giraffes got long necks by constantly stretching to reach higher. However, this fails to explain how giraffes stretching changes their DNA.\n \nAnd that laughable character, Weismann, is the dude who got on his high horse and officially proclaimed the forbiddance of the flow of genetic information from body cells and germ cells, sperm and eggs.....which forbids the inheritance of acquired characteristics. \n\n Interesting wording. Can you find an example of Lamarckism that cannot be explained at least as well by the current ToE?\n \nAnd evidently that's all it took for those elitist scientists at Harvard and Oxford Universities to proclaim that Lamarck was the king of the XXXXXX. \n\n The evidence does refute his theory. You know that, right?\n \nAnd for decades, evolutionist fools proclaimed they had decoded the Book of Life....they said that individual genes controlled individual traits. Well all that came to a crashing halt when the Human Genome Project showed that the one-gene/one-phenotype concept was indeed a fairytale. Instead, to the shock and dismay of teary-eyed evolutionists, they found that the human genome only has about 25,000 genes - over 100,000 short of their estimate. This meant their theory about how they thought life worked had to be scrapped. \n\n So a theory was revised... does that mean that it was wrong afterwards?\n \nOf course among other things, it showed everyone that all those trillions of dollars pumped into biotech were a big waste of money because it was now it's impossible to expect genetic engineers to cure all our diseases by fixing our genes - not only are individual genes not necessarily responsible for individual traits, but there simply are not enough genes to account for the incredible complexity of the human body. \n\n Evidence? That doesn't mean, \"what you believe;\" it means actual scientific evidence.\n \nNot only that, but scientists could no longer say that it was our genes that made us different than other animal....it turns out that humans have the same number of genes as many primitive organisms! \n\n Aren't scientists saying that we descended from the same ancestor as the other primates? I think you just hurt your case (I say think because I'm not sure you have a case).\n \nIn otherwords -- the past 100 years of science have been a giant waste of time!\n\n Computors, quantum mechanics, vaccines, etc. Do you really think that is a waste of time?\n \nBut was this pronounced on CNN? Heck no! The media kooks just plays dumb like they always do.....and this is so society will stay successfully dumbed down. But if everything was on the up and up, scientists would admit that it's not our genes, but our BRAIN - our miraculous, God-given brain - that controls our physiology and behavior. \n\n Do you have evidence that the human brain involves miracles or god? I didn't think so...\n \nThrough our brain, environmental influences, including nutrition, stress, and emotions can not only modify genes -- but they can pass these genetic changes to future generations...as epigenetics proves.\n\n What are you trying to prove here? You aren't doing a good job of convincing anybody that Lamarckism is more accurate than the current ToE. Even if you did, there would be a new theory of evolution by aquired characteristics that would still involve the fossil record and would not involve a deity.\n \nUltimately, I believe that our physical body is effected [sic] by our brain - more specifically our mind. Our thought patterns, including stress and emotions directly influence the body's physiology. Evolutionists hate talking about the mind - and that's because they cannot explain it. \n\n To quote someone:\n \"If the human brain would be so simple that we could understand it, we would be so simple that we couldn't.\"\n \nAnd since they can't explain it, they just simply ignore it....and then, once the brain is successfully swept under the carptet [sic], they attempt to explain life without the incorporating the mind! \n\n \"The incorporating the mind...\" The human brain has little to do with genetics. If you wish to argue the point, provide a source.\n \nIt's a sham forced down our throats by an elitist community of quacks who pass themselves off as scienitsts. And their sham has tricked millions into believing that the body has control over the mind instead of the mind having control over the body.\n\n Is this relevant? Actually, it does seem to go well with your new tactic: confuse everybody and say that our arguments are nonsense or irrelevant.\n \n\"In recent years, molecular biology has shown that the genome is far more fluid and responsive to the environment than previously supposed. It has also shown that information can be transmitted to descendants in ways other than through the base seqeunce of DNA.\" (Jablonka and Lamb 1995.)\n\n That is more on topic, at least. I notice that you didn't actually post the mechanism that was suggested... Did it conflict with your argument?\n \n Well, that was a confusing post (intentionally, I think). Alternatively, supersport doesn't understand what he is talking about and is quote mining (again).",

   "1. There is an interaction between the population and the environment in Darwinism. As you noted, it is the environment that provides the selection criteria. It's just that, at the level of the individual, you are either lucky or unlucky in your genetic heritage. Either you get the alleles that provide a survival edge in that particular environment, or you don't. This seems to be a problem with many creationists: they want CONTROL over the evolutionary process. IOW, they want what they do in their lifetimes to matter in an evolutionary context.\n \n I find this attitude theologically puzzling. Why this emphasis on personal control of destiny? In Christian theology, we are all dependent on God. If you are in the Reformed tradition, there is predestination. You have no control whatsoever on whether you are saved or not. You're either born in the Elect or you are not. In the rest of Christianity, grace and salvation are gifts of God. We are utterly dependent on God. Could it be that the revolt against evolution is just part of the revolt against God on the part of creationists?\n \n 2. A recent Scientific American had an article where characteristics acquired by an organism were passed down for up to 10 generations. I'll get that when I'm home tonight. \n \n Would that \"devastate\" your world view? If so, why? If not, why not?",

   "they evolved just like these butterflies did...\n \n http://unisci.com/stories/20021/0313021.htm\n\n \n If you read the article correctly, there are no tansgenic butterflies yet. \n \n \"The next step in understanding the genetics of butterfly wing patterns, they note, is development of the first transgenic butterfly -- a butterfly in which gene expression is manipulated to see if certain genes control color pattern -- an effort that is underway in Monteiro's UB laboratory. She expects to have it developed by the end of this summer.\"\n \n However, the idea that direct manufacture of organisms by inserting genes is the source of all species has already been shown to be false. It didn't happen that way. \n \n I too work with transgenic animals. Specifically mice that have had either Green Fluorescent Protein or bacterial beta-galactosidase inserted into the genome of mouse embryonic stem cells, and then these ES cells used to make a complete mouse. Both proteins are bacterial, and the DNA is bacterial. Obviously there is a gap between C57 mice and the GFP and beta-gal mice. One generation the DNA wasn't there, the next generation it was. So if we would look at the DNA sequences of these mice, we would see sequences (GFP and beta-gal) that are independent observations and not related to other mice.\n \n Well, evolutionary biologists have been doing phylogenetic analysis since the early 1980s. DNA sequences from thousands of species have been obtained. Not the entire genome, but extensive parts of genomes. What phylogenetic analysis has shown is that DNA sequence are NOT independent observations -- as would be true if creationism or gene engineering -- were true. Instead, DNA sequences from all taxa are related thru historical connections -- descent with modification (evolution). \n \n So no, species did not arise thru manufacture by an intelligent agent inserting genes.",

   "Did you find the article?\n\n \n Yes, I did. It is E. Watters, DNA is not destiny. Discover Nov. 2006, pg 32-37.\n \n The search term you want to use on PubMed is \"epigenetics\".\n \n \"To the surprise of scientists, many environmentally induced changes turn out to be heritable. When exposed to predators, Daphnia water fleas grow defensive spines. The effect can last for generations.\"\n \n \"\"With no more than a change in diet, laboratory agouti mice were prompted to give birth to young that differed markedly in appearance and disease susceptibility. Recently, researchers showed that an epigenetic change in nematode worms can be inherited for 80 generations.\"\n \n Let me explain. The epigenome is the set of transcription factor receptors and bound factors and repressors along the DNA that tell which genes to be expressed and which to be suppressed. Agouti mice have a gene -- called agouti -- that give the mice a ravenous apetite, yellow fur, and susceptibility to cancer and diabetes. By giving the mothers a diet rich in methyl donors -- which methylate the DNA and turn off the agouti gene -- the researchers got the mothers to give birth to offspring that were slender, brown, and not susceptible to cancer and diabetes. So, the agouti gene is still there, but it is turned off. The references are:\n 1: Dolinoy DC, Weidman JR, Waterland RA, Jirtle RL. \n Maternal genistein alters coat color and protects Avy mouse offspring from\n obesity by modifying the fetal epigenome.\n Environ Health Perspect. 2006 Apr;114(4):567-72. \n PMID: 16581547 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n \n 2: Waterland RA, Jirtle RL. \n Transposable elements: targets for early nutritional effects on epigenetic gene regulation.\n Mol Cell Biol. 2003 Aug;23(15):5293-300. \n \n However, because the genes in germ cells of the offspring are ALSO methylated, the offspring of the agouti will also be slender and have the agouti gene turned off. It will be several generations before all the methylation sites are de-methylated and the agouti gene will again be expressed. \n \n Something similar is probably also happening in the Daphnia. Avoiding predators is triggering chemical changes in the body -- production of the equivalent of adrenaline, toxins from strenuous use of muscles, etc -- that at to alter the epigenome and de-repress a gene for spines. The gene was always there, but it is a waste of energy to form spines if they are not needed. So they are repressed by methylation of the gene or some other mechanism. The stress of avoiding predators releases de-methylation agents or some other de-repressor and now the gene is expressed. Again, because this happens in all cells, the germ cells are affected and the offspring are born with spines. \n \n In Drosophila there is a repressed developmental pathway. In this case it is suppressed by heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) that binds to the DNA and prevents transcription of a whole set of genes in that developmental pathway. Since it is not under natural selection, the pathway accumulates mutations. When the parents are stressed with a hot environment, HSP90 is needed for other tasks and no longer binds to the DNA. The offspring have the alternative developmental pathway expressed and have some very major changes -- due to the mutations in the DNA that, until now, were not expressed.\n \n 2. E Pennisi, Heat shock protein mutes genetic changes. Science282: 1796, Dec. 4, 1998. \n 4. E Pennisi, How the genome readies itself for evolution, Science 281:1131-1134, Aug. 21, 1998. \n \n The Discover article has a box on page 37 entitled \"Lamarck's Last Laugh\". \n \"But the burgeoning science of epigenetics suggests that Lamarck may been at least a little bit right. The diet, behavior, and environmental surroundings of today's parents can indeed reshape their hereditary legacy for generations to come.\"\n \n I'm really curious to see how Supersport reacts. He made the statement that if Lamarckism is right, then it devastates his worldview. I wonder, if Lamarck is a little bit right, does that mean his worldview is devastated or only a \"little bit\" devastated? And is a \"little bit devastated\" like being a little bit pregnant?",

   "The ability to \"change\" very well may be heritable. \n\n \n Yes, it is. It's called the \"Baldwin Effect\" You can see a discussion of it in Darwin's Dangerous Idea pp 77-80. In brief, creatures capable of \"reinforcment learning\" do better individually than creatures that are entirely \"hard-wired\".\n \n In your example, you could have an individual whose muscle mass was hard-wired by the genes. That is, the muscle mass was fixed by genetic determinism. The alternative would be to have the genes program muscle mass to be flexible depending on the environment. IOW, the genes give plasticity to the phenotype. So, while under normal environmental conditions the muscle mass may be lower than that of hard-wired genes, in extreme environments of muscle use the maximum muscle mass capable in this individual would be higher than those individuals that are hard-wired.\n \n I can think of at least one well-documented instance of plasticity in humans -- Wolff's law. Wolff's law states that bones model according to the forces placed on them. So each person's bones are slightly different because they can respond to the environment. A quarterback or baseball pitcher will have protuberances on the bones around the shoulder where the muscles used in throwing attach. Because these individuals put more force on those muscles than non-throwers. Similarly, long distance runners will have reinforced parts of their leg bones where those muscles attach. All this to make the for stronger and better throwers or runners.",

Lamarck never argued for shorter tails in mice -- he was dead then.\n\n \n I did address the point. You just ignored it. Let me do this again:\n \n From the website discussing Lamarckism: \"This rule -- that use or disuse causes structures to enlarge or shrink -- Lamarck called the \"First Law\" in his book Philosophie zoologique. Lamarck's \"Second Law\" stated that all such changes were heritable. The result of these laws was the continuous, gradual change of all organisms, \"\n \n So, BOTH use and disuse will be inherited.

So, what Weissman did by chopping off tails was to make them not used. Since they are not used, Lamarck said subsequent generations should have shorter tails. They do not. It was indeed a fair test of Lamarckism. As the mice became adapted to the environment of Weissman's lab, they should have had shorter tails. Because tails were not used in that environment.\"\n \n That's right to the point. No tails. No use of the tails. You seem to be retreating to the position that Lamarck never discussed amputation of tails. But he didn't have to for that to be a valid test of the theory. Darwin never mentioned phylogenetic analysis, either, but scientists used it as a valid test of his theory. \n \n \nBut regardless of what Lamarck believed -- which you just misrepresented, \n\n \n I gave you my source for Lamarck's statements. You must provide a counter-source that contradicts that. Simple denial doesn't cut it.\n \n \nthe truth is that individual animals DO respond to their enviornment by altering their physiologies. It happens all over the animal kingdom. \n\n \n But are those changes heritable? That's the key. One of the terms you objected to in another thread is \"phenotypic plasticity\". This is exactly what we are talking about<b></b>: alteration of physique or physiology in response to the environment. Genotype does NOT rigidly fix phenotype. Long distance running increases type II muscle fibers. Sprints increase type I muscle fibers. \n \n \n http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/0103109.html\n\n \n This article is summarized by this sentence: \"The environment-even social and cultural contexts-can switch genes on and off.\"\n \n That means whether the gene is transcribed to make a protein or not. It does NOT mean changing the sequence of bases that make up the DNA of the gene. \n \n \n http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/natbltn/700-799/nb706.htm\n\n \n \"The color changes in all of these animals are, for the most part, the \n result of changes in certain star-shaped pigment-bearing cells in the \n skin, called chromatophores.\"\n \n But it is the genes that give the instructions to build the chromatophores and provide the receptors on the cell surface to change the distribution of pigments. Nothing in the environment changes the base sequence in the genes.\n \n \n http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/03/060306112859.htm\n\n \n From the site: \"This study highlights how a simple difference in habitat microstructure can have a major influence on patterns of development, morphology and evolution. \"\n \n In this case, the salamander has a set of extra developmental genes that leads to metamorphosis. This set of genes is suppressed while the salamander is a juvenile. It is very similar to bone genes being suppressed in liver cells and vice versa. The loose gravel streambeds trigger a chemical cue that unsuppresses the metamorphic gene set. The website doesn't go into that cue, but several similar situations are known.\n \n Again, the issue is a set of genes that is turned on or remains off. Usually in these cases a protein binds to the control region of the gene and will not let the gene be transcribed. It is called a \"repressor\". A second protein or perhaps a chemical binds to the repressor. This changes the shape of the repressor which, in turn, causes it to unbind from the DNA. Now the gene is no longer suppressed and is transcribed to messenger RNA, which in turn is translated into protein.\n \n Nothing in here says the base sequence of the DNA itself is altered. And it is that alteration in base sequence that is necessary for Lamarckism to work.\n \n \n http://www.kidcyber.com.au/topics/marineiguana.htm\n \n Another amazing feature in marine iguanas is that when there is not much food around, they don't just become thinner, they get shorter too. It has been discovered that marine iguanas shrink in length and then regrow when food becomes plentiful again. Part of their backbone shrinks. Adult iguanas can switch between growth and shrinkage repeatedly throughout their lifetime. \n\n \n No big deal. It's no different conceptually than humans having their fat cells grow and then shrink depending on their food intake. Here the cells in the intervertebral discs also expand and shrink -- which is what accounts for the change in length. Again, no change in their DNA and they have adapted disc cells that behave differently than human disc cells.\n \n \n And see what scienitsts are too afraid to test is the notion that these changes are heritable. Care to prove me wrong and show me a link that disproves this notion? It would be such an easy test..\n\n \n What are we testing? We already know the ability to increase in length and decrease is heritable! But did you notice that last sentence? \"Adult iguanas can switch between growth and shrinkage repeatedly throughout their lifetime\" So, what \"changes\" are you talking about? Increased length? Decreased length? Since it switches back and forth several times during a lifetime, why would the offspring be systematically longer or shorter than their parents?\n \n \n \"In the model of the heritable switch, a change in the environment sends a signal to each member of the population. This signal activates a genetic command in each individual to call up a preprogrammed subroutine, If the new environment does not last long, the population will revert to its previous state.

Not only do we not have a book and page number to know where Spetner said this, but we don't even know what he is talking about! It's one thing for signals to last thru cell divisions within an organism. It's another to talk about generations. Where is his data? Without the specific data, all we have are bare assertions.\n \n I suggest you go up a couple of posts and look at the post I did on epigenetics.",

   "It is my understanding that Lamarck claimed that morphological effects stimulated by organic behaviours _may_ or _might be_ , or _can_ or _could be_, transmitted from an organism to its offspring. Certainly not that those effects _must be_ so transmitted. In that conditional sense Weismann's mice are a red herring.\n \n The issue is to discover two things before any modern form of Lamarckism can be dismissed or affirmed. First, what conditions must be present before before phenotypic plasticity becomes epigenetically inheritable over generations.\n Second, a theoretical model, [along the lines of the re-worked Lamarckism in James Baldwin's famous \"Effect\"] that would lead to an understanding of the molecular mechanics involved in empirical examples of Lamarckian epigenetic inheritance; that is, of developmental effects repeated over generations, in such a way that not only inherited variation in developed phenotypes is accounted for, but also, and more importantly, that the evolutionary origins of novel, original phenotypic traits might also be made accessible to empirical study.\n \n However, _if_ these two requisites can be satisfied affirmatively, then both the \"Natural Selection\" of Darwin, et al, and the supposed [by Fisher/Mahr, et al] coincidentally beneficial trait changes generated by chance-dependent genetic mutations, would have to be recognised as evolutionary biology's foundational errors. And from that, questions would have to be answered as to how, and why, such colossal blunders were perpetuated for the past 150 years.\n \n Of course, another question arises from this. That is, why would people whose reputations are dependent upon unquestioning acceptance of the, 'chance followed by subtraction/mechanical sorting', Darwinian model ever put any effort into examining the above Lamarckian issues? Would they not rather block such efforts, or try to interpret any evidence that might support them in some sort of Darwinian rationale, as in the aforementioned case of the \"Baldwin Effect\"?\n \n I do not know, and since I am am not a biologist, most especially not a geneticist, and the answer won't affect my prestige or income in any way, and as I am not affiliated with any established church, or any religious sect, so that it will make no difference to my own cosmology, either, I don't much care, either. I just like to discuss ideas with reasonable people. \n \n Lastly, this is my first post to this forum and I look forward to discovering what calibre of response I can expect here--if any. :)",

I guess.emoticon_smile \n \n \n \n\n \n I don't have the time right now.\n \n However, I do have the time to ask: what testable predictions does Lamarckism make?\n\n \n **\n Well, I think that any prediction made by a lamarckian mechanism would be the opposite of any prediction anticipated from a darwinian, in that their basic assumptions about the process involved proceed in opposite directions.\n \n By this, I struggle to say that the base premise of modern Darwinism-- [I know that some of you hate that term, but that is how the general public sees it]-- is, as I understand it, that inherited characteristics in the morphology and behaviour of organisms are genetically determined, and that where changes in morphology and behaviour in any identified class of organisms occurs over generations, then those changes must be traceable to a change in the genotype that _preceded_ the change in the phenotype.\n \n OTH, the basic principle of the lamarckian hypothesis is that the change in the phenotype (its morphology and behaviour) preceded the change in the genotype. That is, that a change in the local environment prompted a change in behaviour in the organisms affected, and that that behavioural change stimulated a change in morphology, and that altered behaviour and morphology, over one or more generations, stimulated a corresponding, appropriate 'mutation' in the genotype.\n \n That is--\n \n a/Darwinian hypothesis: accidental [entropic] mutagen--<random genotype mutation--<phenotype mutation--<coincidental adaptedness to local environmental pressure (that is, to \"NS\")--<therefore, no, or at least no statistically significant, Natural Selection of novel phenotype--< over one or more generations, novel, better adapted phenotype (and its genotype) replaces weakly adapted original phenotype (and its genotype) in a particular population of like organisms in the local ecosystem with the altered environment .\n \n b/Lamarckian hypothesis: random, robust change in an ecosystem's environment, (more particularly in the personal environment/s (umlaut/s) of one or more members of a particular population of like organisms), causes these organisms to alter their behaviours in order to survive, thrive, and reproduce. This altered behaviour stimulates changes in morphology, and this in turn stimulates alterations in development of the next generation (that is developing while the parent is stimulated as above). Through epigenetic inheritance some of the changes in the parent's behaviour and morphology are passed on to their offspring, and are there enhanced,developmentally. Should these conditions persist over several generations, the organisms involved may stimulate their own genomes to change so as to accomodate the genotype to the new phenotype's reality. \n \n If you disagree with my characterizations of these two hypotheses, please specify where and how we differ.\n \n IAC, it would seem to me that with one hypothesis based upon random, accidental, genotypic mutation antedating a phenotypic mutation that, by sheer fortuitous coincidence, enables greater organismic adaptedness to a randomly occurring, local environmental phenomenon, therebye enabling absence of ,(or, \"positive\"), 'selection', and with the other holding that random, stochastic environmental changes first stimulate organismic response, which later stimulates a genetic response, should be testable in the standard, empirical, experimental fashion, in keeping with the precepts of the scientific method.\n \n I could suggest some approaches, but as I am not a biologist, the actual protocols should be left to a professional. And in fact, there is no point in my making those suggestions until we are in accord on the descriptions of the two hypotheses, as I have begun, above.\n \n Hoping to hear from you soon.",

   "Let me explain. The epigenome is the set of transcription factor receptors and bound factors and repressors along the DNA that tell which genes to be expressed and which to be suppressed. Agouti mice have a gene -- called agouti -- that give the mice a ravenous apetite, yellow fur, and susceptibility to cancer and diabetes. By giving the mothers a diet rich in methyl donors -- which methylate the DNA and turn off the agouti gene -- the researchers got the mothers to give birth to offspring that were slender, brown, and not susceptible to cancer and diabetes. So, the agouti gene is still there, but it is turned off.\n\n \n Excellent! In my ignorance I speculated in another thread that such behaviour - environmentally-cued repression and expression of genes, itself a randomly-evolved mechanism - would ultimately triumph over hardwired genes if a population is repeatedly exposed to similar variations of environment. It's nice to know I wasn't talking through my trousers at the time :)\n \n Supersport, if I could address your points directly now:\n \n From my reading of the subject, it seems to me that you are (quite understandably) confusing genuine Lamarckism with a more narrowly defined environmental sensitivity permitted by Darwinism.\n \n In Lamarckism, evolution is the inheritance of acquired characteristics. A giraffe stretches its neck seeking sustenance, and its offspring inherit a lengthened neck. Darwinism does not forbid environmentally sensitive genomes, but it does predict the following:\n \n 1. The sensitivity itself arose via natural selection.\n 2. We will only ever observe genomes sensitive to environmental variations which have occurred frequently and over extended periods of a species's history. If we contrive truly novel environmental variations for that species, it will be able to adapt only through natural selection.\n 3. Any acquired characteristics apparently inherited by offspring will have arisen (like the spiny fly) via chemical triggering of their sensitive genome while within the parent organism.\n \n All the examples given in the thread so far of allegedly Lamarckian adaptation fall within the bounds of genetic sensitivity permitted by Darwinism.\n \n I realise now that I was totally wrong to suggest, in another thread, that the dominant mechanism of evolution  might have changed over the past few billion years, because evolution is genetic change. Rather I should have said that superior mechanisms for environmental adaptation have evolved. Chemically sensitive regulatory genes are just such a mechanism: they permit the same genome to flourish within a wider band of environmental conditions.\n \n \nBut if everything was on the up and up, scientists would admit that it's not our genes, but our BRAIN - our miraculous, God-given brain - that controls our physiology and behavior. Through our brain, environmental influences, including nutrition, stress, and emotions can not only modify genes -- but they can pass these genetic changes to future generations...as epigenetics proves.\n\n \n With respect, a fly has very little brain and a plant none at all. Are flies less capable of adaptation? Are plants incapable? Or are you asking that we support two different, parallel evolutionary mechanisms?\n \n The part I highlighted in bold is your primary misconception. Nutrition, stress and emotions do not modify genes any more than pressing keys on a typewriter modifies the alphabet; they merely influence which genes are expressed - and that genetic sensitivity arose through natural selection. What you describe as inherited genetic changes are nothing of the sort; the offspring retain the same sensitive genome (barring mutation, of course); any apparently inherited acquired changes are the result of chemical triggering while within the parent.\n \n Hope this helps clear things up!",

I am not here to play debating games, responding to your questions, one after another after another, as if you were some self-appointed latter-day Socrates!\n \n If you wish me to answer your 'question one', you must accept a definition of 'mechanism' that means 'scientifically acceptable explanation', and not the strictly mechanical details [physics/chemistry] of biologically autopoietic systems, as they are confined to, and delimited by, the metaphysical postulates of \"Mechanism\".\n You could look up Mechanism in the Stanford guide, if you are not already familiar with it. Basically, it's an offshoot of Materialism and its metaphysical postulates and premises.\n My point is basically that as I am not a 'molecular biologist', it is beyond my ability, ambition, and above all, _needs_, to spell out the physics/chemistry involved. \n Can you spell out the physics and chemistry of \"Natural Selection\" for me? Or determine the 'mechanics' of 'random genetic system failure coincidentally creating adaptive (to local, randomly occurring environmental change) phenotypic change', aka, \"RM+NS\"?\n \n As for question two, _epigenetic inheritance_ and _developmental evolution_ are facts, not hypotheses, even though darwinists prefer to \"evolutionary development. You can trace devo-evo all the way back to Von Baer, if you're interested. Google these terms, and see what you learn.\n \n \n As for your third and last (and I do hope it is the last) question, 'plausible' doesn't enter into it. Darwin's \"Natural Selection\" has been 'plausible', but scientically undemonstrated for 150 years. Fisher, Haldane, et al, put forward, \"Random, accidental, yet coincidentally adaptive\" genetic mutation 80 years ago, as a 'plausible' mechanism for what \"NS\" lacked all along--a source for the origins of change that \"NS\" supposedly sorted out mechanically.\n It must still be \"plausible\", since after all these decades most of the evolutionary biology cadres still swear by it. But, since it is totally based upon chance, (that is, randomly occurring genomic system failures, entropic events that are stochastic and unpredictable), it simply cannot be tested by science, and so remains a metaphysical postulate that certain scientists mistake (deliberately, as it seems to me), for a scientific principle.\n \n As for a neo-Lamarckian devo-evo hypothesis of a mechanism driving evolution as organismic responses to local, randomly occurring but chronic and robust environmental stimuli, that is more than \"plausible\"--it's _actual_, as per my answer to your question one. The evidence is out there if you take a few minutes to 'google' it.\n \n Now I'd really like to continue a nice give-and-take discussion with you, but it irritates me when people assume an aggressive, interogatory stance, instead. So let's be frank and open with each other, and both put our cards on the table from here on, shall we?

It's really that simple. It's either one way or the other -- and science refuses to test the latter scenario.\n\n \n I'm sorry, but Darwinism states nothing of the sort! Mutations arise at random; there is no requirement for them to occur before exposure to a new environment.

   "I don't know how my car works, yet it clearly does. Does that obviate the need for a mechanical explanation - though I may personally be ignorant of it - to exist?\n\n \n Hello Peeling;\n \n A couple of observations on your response. First, we are not discussing automobiles or other human artefacts--we are discussing live autopoietic systems, i.e., organisms. The two are not analogous. It was the improper use of a false analogy (i.e., \"Natural Selection\"), that started the argument 150 years ago. We have to be more careful about confusing metaphors for reality.\n \n Second, the answer to your question, rhetorical as it is, is,-- no, of course not.\n Just to be clear, I never implied that it was not, but rather, took pains to establish for 'Hi its me' and yourself and anyone else reading that I, myself, in this debate, am not required to provide the mechanical details, i.e., the biochemistry, the nuclear biology, whatever, required to flesh out my basic premise, any more than Darwin was required to provide the physics and chemistry of \"Natural Selection\".\n The difference between us (myself and Darwin) being that the physics and chemistry of \"NS\", (i.e., the \"mechanical details\" of \"NS\" as a causal mechanism), can never be demonstrated, since \"Natural Selection\" is no more than a litererary device, and a vacuous one at that, while, OTH, the 'systems biology' of neo-lamarckian theories enable empirical explanations and descriptions of the mechanics involved.\n More on that some other time, but another very important point must be brought out here--__descriptions__ of mechanical details are NOT an __explanation__for them, and _hypothetical\n explanations_ of phenomena [eg., evolution], do not require these mechanical details, but simply a rational, testable, principle. The details will be described in their own time, as science follows the direction of the basic principle. Provided that that principle is not hollow, as, after 150 years, \"NS\" has shown itself to be.\n \n \n\n Assuming I at least am willing to hear such an answer, what would it be? I'm curious as to how scientific a mechanism for feeding physiological changes back to an embryonic genome can be if it does not proceed physically or chemically.\n\n \n **\n Again, I never said that it did not. See above.\n \n \n\n If I may, I'd like to call attention to a disputable implication in this paragraph. You imply that for Darwinian evolution to occur, random mutation must be coincident with and adaptive to random, local environmental change. This is simply false: abundant resources, changes in interbreeding patterns and expanding ranges allow mutation and drift to explore a broad region of neighbouring genetic space before encountering the marshalling forces of natural selection.\n\n \n **\n With respect, you are supporting my position against the Darwinian premise that \"Natural Selection\" _causes_ evolution. More importantly, you are arguing against the basic Fisher/Haldane principle that 'genetic mutations are strictly random (i.e., coincidental), WRT \"fitness\", (i.e. adaptedness'). This was the blow to the \"Modern Synthesis\" (RM+NS) first revealed in the 60's by Sewall Wright. The result of Wright's work, the discovery that \"NS\" was not a mechanism for _causing_ evolution, but rather a mechanism for _preventing_ it.\n Also, please note that you are attributing evolution to responses to environmental factors, a lamarkian position, although you still imply that the source of behavioural/morphological organismic (empirical) evolution is merely an epiphenomenon of an abstraction,-- \" mutation and drift [] explore a broad region of neighbouring genetic space\". \"Mutation\" and \"Drift\" are just another way of saying genomic entropy, and \"genetic space\" is another abstraction developed from other abstractions, such as, \"fitness landscape\", etc. All of these metaphors being theoretical abstractions, and not empirical realities. More like metaphysics than physics.\n The only empirical observation is this one-- we can _ see_ that as organisms encounter different environments, they evolve to suit them. The question is, how and why does this happen--purely by accident (stochastic, entropic, genomic system failure, i.e., \"RM\"), or teleologically, autopoietically, as a direct and internally directed organismic response to novel environments, to which \"NS\" is simply irrelevent?\n \n \n\n At this point I would direct you towards my earlier response to supersport: the environmentally-sensitive genomes we have observed, though they do indeed respond to 'local, randomly occurring robust stimuli', all fall into the sub-category of responding to 'local, randomly occurring, repeatedly experienced variations in stimuli' - and responding in a way predetermined by the genome. Both the response and the non-response are already encoded, with one or the other being chemically triggered. We have not - to my knowledge - observed new genomes arising in a Lamarckian manner.\n\n \n **\n Allow me to point out that \"[w]e have not - to my knowledge - observed new genomes arising in [any manner at all]\", but that if we ever did see a brand new genome pop out of nowhere, 'creatio ex nihilo', it would be proof positive for the religious 'special creation' hypothesis!!\n Evolution is not 'all or nothing', and indeed the entire concept of 'change' is not 'all or nothing'. The question before us is, that given that no genome changes entirely, at one time, but rather, changes in part, over time, do these changes _all_ and _always_ come as the entropic effect of some chance-dependent cause, or are some of them, (the beneficial, adaptive, non-destructive, non-trivial, effectual ones), organismically directed to suit the organisms own goals and objectives--i.e., to survive, to thrive, and to reproduce? \n \n \n\n The other problems I have with Lamarckism are as follows:\n \n First, that it requires either an essentially unlimited variety of physical mechanisms - and the constant evolution of new mechanisms - or an all-encompassing intelligence to feed something as vaguely defined as 'a change in behaviour' back to an organism's genome.\n\n \n **\n Sorry, but it is both \"Random Genetic Mutation\" and \"Natural Selection\", that each require, \"an essentially unlimited variety of physical mechanisms - and the constant evolution of new mechanisms\", in order to substantiate themselves, and not neo-lamarckian devo-evo. \n \n But you have hit upon an extremely important point!! Science studies \"cause and effect\" in an effort to rationalise existence to the point where we can make valid predictions about some future events. Ever since the \"Enlightenment\" we have sought for the fundamentals, the basis for causal events, and have come up with a lexicon of physics, with words such as energy, mass, force, entropy, field, and so forth, as labels for the things not directly observed, but implied to the point of undeniability by the behaviour of whatever is directly observable. Apples fall down thanks to \"Gravity\", but no-one has ever seen 'a gravity', nor ever will. It is a force implied by an effect. Its effects can be described both verbally and mathematyically, and its causal action is sufficiently regular to enable falsifiable prediction, but 'in se', we cannot say what it is, but only speculate, with various abstractions and theories.\n \n But no matter, we've made great technical progress for all that. All we've had to do has been to look at empirical events and postulate a common cause for each category. Things that fall down--<Gravity, and so on. So far we now have 4 of these 'natural', 'physical', 'mechanical' forces that are, for our purposes, the basic, fundamental, 'prime movers' of all passive, inert matter--that is, the 'stuff' that makes up the material world.\n \n The problem is that these four forces do not account for the empirically observable differences between \"things that are inanimate\" and \"things that are alive\". Some other basic, fundamental, causal force is necessary to biology, above and beyond the four 'physical' forces that are sufficient to physics and chemistry. I hypothesize a natural force called, appropriately enough, \"Vitality\", and accord to autopoietic biosystems (live organisms) the power and capacity to harness that force to achieve their own personal objectives, such as , to survive, to thrive, and to reproduce. That power and capacity to harness Vitality I call individual, local, intelligence. This intelligence varies from organism to organism, as all traits do, from simple cells to human beings, but all living things have it to some degree, while all inanimate things do not. N.B.--Do not anthropomorphise, and suppose that human intelligence is the be-all and end-all, or suppose that any intelligence possessed by any non-human is merely a diminished quantity of human intelligence. Self-conciousness and analytical thought are not necessary to intelligent organisms.\n \n \n\n Second, that it can only ever explain morphological changes the organism is capable of itself bringing about within its lifetime.\n\n \n **\n True, but we are talking evolution, and evolution requires only a detectable modification carried over a single generation, in point of fact. You may argue that fact by devising an arbitrary definition of 'permanently' or 'semi-permanently' maintained over some arbitrary number of generations, but that just won't wash logically and rationally. Like it or not, epigenetic inheritance is evolutionary. \n Moreover, neo-lamarkian devo-evo does not posit a 'one kick at the can, all or nothing, now or never' view of evolution. It sees evolution as processional, historical, accumulative, but it has no need to limit itself to a uniformitarian gradualism, as RM+NS is self-limited. That is, neo-lamarkism can account for the punctuated equilibrium in the fossil record that is reasonably impossible under \"RM+NS\". Much more robust and radical changes are permissable when self-directed to suit a certain environmental situation, than could ever occur by chance and without regard to the environment.\n \n \n\n A giraffe might 'decide' to stretch for a high branch, but can a proto-bird 'decide' to lay a slightly harder-shelled egg, in the hope of repelling predators? Can a plant 'decide' to produce more of a certain chemical to make its leaves less digestible?\n\n \n **\n Why not!?! Providing, of course, that you leave \"decide\" in quotation marks, and forget all about self-concious analysis and deliberation. Your mistake of course, is an implied anthropomorphization of non-human organisms. You misunderstand 'intelligence' to mean 'human-like intelligence, just less of it'. Intelligence in live organisms varies qualitatively, not just quantitatively. That is why there is a difference between the intelligence of, say, a retarded human being and the intelligence of a normal fox. A fox is intelligent, but not in the same way that any human, retarded or not, is intelligent. Neither is a living cell, a colony of bacteria, a tape-worm or what have you. They are all intelligent for as long as they are alive, but their individual intelligences vary both quantitatively and qualitatively. Only the fundamental source of it, \"Vitality\", is universal, alocal, and immutable.\n \n Anyway, it's been fun. Hope you respond soon.",

   " The difference between us (myself and Darwin) being that the physics and chemistry of \"NS\", (i.e., the \"mechanical details\" of \"NS\" as a causal mechanism), can never be demonstrated, since \"Natural Selection\" is no more than a litererary device, and a vacuous one at that, while, OTH, the 'systems biology' of neo-lamarckian theories enable empirical explanations and descriptions of the mechanics involved.\n\n \n NS is an emergent property of the physics and chemistry of biological organisms. Do mutations occur? Can they have a statistical impact on reproduction? If yes and yes, NS occurs. Note that this makes no statement about how mutations occur: your own 'neo-lamarckism' implies NS every bit as much as Darwinism, otherwise we would be hip-deep in short-necked giraffes reproducing every bit as successfully as those who stretched that little bit higher. Think very carefully before you protest.\n \n Comparing NS, in isolation, with Lamarckism is an abject mismatching of concepts.\n \n \nWith respect, you are supporting my position against the Darwinian premise that \"Natural Selection\" _causes_ evolution.\n\n \n No, mutation and natural selection lead to evolution.\n \n \nMore importantly, you are arguing against the basic Fisher/Haldane principle that 'genetic mutations are strictly random (i.e., coincidental), WRT \"fitness\", (i.e. adaptedness').\n\n \n Actually, I think we're just talking at cross-purposes. I argued against a statement of yours that Darwinism required mutations to be coincident with and adaptive to environmental changes. Coincident, as in happening at the same time. If that was not what you meant, I apologise. In my response I was in no way suggesting that mutations were non-random; quite the opposite: I was relaxing a restriction I perceived you to be applying.\n \n \nThis was the blow to the \"Modern Synthesis\" (RM+NS) first revealed in the 60's by Sewall Wright. The result of Wright's work, the discovery that \"NS\" was not a mechanism for _causing_ evolution, but rather a mechanism for _preventing_ it. Also, please note that you are attributing evolution to responses to environmental factors, a lamarkian position,\n\n \n NS (and drift in large populations, if my understanding is correct) are regulatory aspects of the evolutionary process, while mutation provides the exploratory aspect. Environmental changes (or encountering new environments) can shift the balance of power - again, this is an emergent property of an existing system, requiring no additional mechanisms - it is not a 'response', but a 'consequence'. Analogously, if you shoot me, I don't 'respond' by creating a huge hole in my chest to accommodate the bullet.\n \n \n\"genetic space\" is another abstraction developed from other abstractions, such as, \"fitness landscape\", etc. All of these metaphors being theoretical abstractions, and not empirical realities.\n\n \n Im not sure what point you're trying to make. The \"space\" described by the possible outcomes of a dozen coin-tosses is a theoretical abstraction, but that doesn't stop us using it to make statistical predictions about real-world coin behaviour. Once tossed a dozen times, the actual number of heads and tails is an 'empirical reality'; is that any more useful to us than our 'theoretical abstraction' when predicting the likely outcome of the next dozen?\n \n \nThe only empirical observation is this one-- we can _ see_ that as organisms encounter different environments, they evolve to suit them.\n\n \n Or become extinct. Or experience a wild diaspora, like the cichlids in Lake Tanganyika. They can also evolve when interbreeding is restricted within the same environment, such as can be observed in a number of ring species.\n \n \nAllow me to point out that \"[w]e have not - to my knowledge - observed new genomes arising in [any manner at all]\", but that if we ever did see a brand new genome pop out of nowhere, 'creatio ex nihilo', it would be proof positive for the religious 'special creation' hypothesis!!\n\n \n I have myself to blame for that one. More specifically, then, we have never observed Lamarckian genetic change, only chemical repression and expression. I note that you do not respond to the point that this epigenic adaptation has, in fact, never been observed to occur in response to novel environments, only to historically experienced variations.\n \n \nSorry, but it is both \"Random Genetic Mutation\" and \"Natural Selection\", that each require, \"an essentially unlimited variety of physical mechanisms - and the constant evolution of new mechanisms\", in order to substantiate themselves, and not neo-lamarckian devo-evo.\n\n \n Transparently false. There are a number of documented and observed mechanisms by which mutation can arise. What those mutated genes then go on to do is a different matter - but if they statistically affect reproductive success, their survival in the gene-pool will be affected. What more does Darwinism require?\n \n Lamarckism, on the other hand, requires a chemical feedback mechanism to communicate every possible morphological change back to the genome - and quite a lot of impossible ones; morphological changes animals cannot contrive for themselves during their lifetime, but can only - presumably - 'wish for'. \n \n \nThe problem is that these four forces do not account for the empirically observable differences between \"things that are inanimate\" and \"things that are alive\".\n\n \n Ah. Right. I wondered if that was what all this was leading up to. Your argument, then, is that since you reject Darwinism, and Lamarckism doesn't make sense based on physics or chemistry, there must be some kind of intelligent driving force contriving changes that the organisms themselves could not possibly conceive as being necessary.\n \n And you have the gall to describe NS as metaphysical?\n \n I'll return to 'vitality' later.\n \n \nTrue, but we are talking evolution, and evolution requires only a detectable modification carried over a single generation, in point of fact. You may argue that fact by devising an arbitrary definition of 'permanently' or 'semi-permanently' maintained over some arbitrary number of generations, but that just won't wash logically and rationally. Like it or not, epigenetic inheritance is evolutionary. \n\n \n Actually, it's not a matter of the number of generations, but of there being no genetic change in the cases you describe - so much for your much-vaunted reliance upon the empirical. Barring random mutation, offspring inherit everything, including those chemically sensitive genes. Epigenics cannot account for common descent - for which the evidence is crushingly overwhelming.\n \n \nThat is, neo-lamarkism can account for the punctuated equilibrium in the fossil record that is reasonably impossible under \"RM+NS\". Much more robust and radical changes are permissable when self-directed to suit a certain environmental situation, than could ever occur by chance and without regard to the environment.\n\n \n Your error here is to assume that the punctuation of equilibrium must be characterised by a marked environmental change requiring organisms to radically self-modify or die out. \n \n However, such is not necessarily the case. Fossil records with a paucity of intermediate forms are readily explained by migration: new forms arising on the periphery of a population and then sweeping near-instantaneously (geologically speaking) across the ranges of their ancestral species. We would not expect to find transitional forms anywhere except at the locus of speciation - or possibly even along a path of speciation, if a population migrated to follow changing resources. That location or path might be unsuited to fossil formation and retention, or we may simply not have dug it up yet. If anything, the lack of transitional fossils across the entire range of a species is more problematic for Lamarckism than Darwinism, since it denies the ubiquity of your hypothetical 'vitality': how, in your model, is it possible for a species to be supplanted in their environment by a variant descended from other members of that species, if all members are equally capable of adaptation? According to you, any variants migrating into a region already occupied by that species would encounter the same variants, as well or better adapted! If they don't, and the newcomers, being better adapted, supplant their ancestral species, we are right back to natural selection.\n \n Also, RM+NS has, as we have discussed, its own emergent regulatory system. Only here, the environmental change which gives mutation the reins is the coming of a time (or place) of unusual plenty, not hardship. \n \n \nThey are all intelligent for as long as they are alive, but their individual intelligences vary both quantitatively and qualitatively. Only the fundamental source of it, \"Vitality\", is universal, alocal, and immutable.\n\n \n And so we return to 'vitality', this mystical invention to plug the gaps in Lamarckism. A kind of 'intelligence' able to redesign - indeed, remould within the lifetime of a single animal - any part of that creature.\n \n So why have we never seen this incredible force at work? Wherever we do see morphological responses to environmental stimuli, we find a prosaic, genetic mechanism in place to handle that exact situation in that exact way. What basis do you have for postulating this intangible 'vitality', when every single observation you claim to support your hypothesis operates according to existing chemical and physical laws?",

   "NS is an emergent property of the physics and chemistry of biological organisms.\n\n \n **\n Sadly, peeling, in this last post of yours, your tone has deteriorated badly. Often it ranges from contemptuous and disdainful to patronizing, pompous, and pedantic. I don't much like being sneered at, or fatuously condescended to. If you can't show more respect and good manners, I shall have to ignore you in future.\n \n For the moment, I have only a little time to make a start on your post. Above, you mention the materialist mystic postulate, \"emergent property\". This wonderful 'something or other' supposedly 'spontaneously generates' itself out of nothing and nowhere for no observable (empirical) reason. Moreover, it is supposed, by materialists, mechanists, positivists, naturalists, physicalists, et al, to violate the prime directive of all reason and logic and, _science_. That being, 'ex nihilo, nihil fit'. Nothing can be made out of nothing. That is, if a certain set does not contain a certain property, then it cannot, in and of itself alone, generate the property it does not possess. Autonomously generated novelty via \"emergence\" is nothing but an appeal to the long discredited postulate, \"spontaneous generation\", and the even longer discredited postulate, \"magick\". There is no such thing as a 'bottom-up' emergent property, anywhere in reality, but only, it seems, in the mysticism of \"Natural Selection\".\n \n For a set with x number of properties to become a set with x+1 properties, or to go from set x to set y, requires the presence of something not intrinsic to set x. In the well-known case of table salt, NaCl, Na, the metal sodium, cannot become NaCl, salt, without the external addition of Cl, chlorine, a poisonous gas. Cl is helpless on its own, as well. Both entities are entirely passive and helpess, in se, but when placed together the electromagnetic force which exists apart from and independent of their own particular and particulate existence, causes their electrons to be reformed (mutated?) into a novel particulate, (i.e., molecule, NaCl). \n \n It is the action of these 'basic forces', as supposed and inferred from the behaviour of otherwise passive and inert, 'bits of stuff' , that all of science depends upon. The basic forces supposed to be at the bottom of every physical event are, as you know, the Force of Gravity, the Electro-Magnetic Force, The Strong Nuclear Force, and The Weak Nuclear Force. To attribute any change in reality to anything other than these four forces requires either the 'magick' of 'spontaneous (creatio ex nihilo) generation' (which includes the 'miracles' of an external 'creator god'), or, where forced by the inability of these four forces to account for an empirically observable phenomenon, (such as life and death, intelligence and volition, and all other 'psychical' phenomena), the assumption of a fifth natural force.\n \n Since I am no fan of magic, I posit a fifth force, and call it, Vitality. Vitalism, like Lamarckism, has a long and respectable history, and like the 19th century mechanist arguments against Lamarck's primitive understanding of evolution's internal mechanism, the arguments against against even primitive \"Vitalism\" were at best, specious.\n \n Since it has taken this much just to deal with your first sentence, I suggest you respond to this critique of, \"mechanical emergence\", before I go on to your second. Besides, I shall need to be able to restrain my natural tendency to 'respond in kind' as I come to certain parts of your last post. I have tried to keep my own tone in check so far, as best I can.",

   "I assume that you mean that life is a property which cannot have been generated without more life?\n Unfortunately (for you), that is not the same as saying, \"life could not have been generated from nothing.\"\n\n \n **\n Your assumption is wrong. You assume that by Vitality I mean Life, but I do not. Nor do I think that I am making a purely semantic distinction.\n What I said was that life, as a property of living organisms, has to arrive from a source external to the material particulate 'bits', [i.e., atoms, molecules],that make up the physical constituents of that organism. That source I categorized as a 'force', (meaning exactly what is meant by 'force' when that word is applied to gravity, etc.). That means that 'life' in an organism cannot arise by 'spontaneous generation', 'ex nihilo'; a medieval notion that was supposed to have been destroyed years ago.\n Moreover a dead organism cannot be resuscitated using the four physical forces, no matter how much electricity, magnetism, gravity, or nuclear energy is exerted upon it.\n And of course, no collation of chemicals, electronics and whatnot, can generate a live organism by abiogenesis. Life, that is, the power that enables the operations and behaviours attributed to live organisms only, must come from an external source. How so?\n Life may continue from one form to another by reproduction, but it does not start up anew each time. Biological reproduction is life from life. The torch is passed, without the fire having to be re-lit.\n Some human artefacts display some of the characteristic operations and behaviours of living organisms, even though they are not alive. That is because we, as living organisms, invested them with and through our own powers and capacities. They are not sui generis. And they are not alive, either.\n Life has to be the product of a fifth force operating upon chemicals if they are to form the functioning biosystems which we call live organisms. Thus, individual lives, as local phenomena, are the product of Vitality, a universal, alocal, force. I see life as a product of Vitality, and Vitality as different from life, per se. That is, I see biological 'life' as simply an expressed aspect of Vitality acting upon the chemical constituents of a biosystem, enabling that system to act dynamically, in its own interest, instead of just reacting, passively, to external mechanical pressures.\n \n Life on earth shows no sign of spontaneously generating itself solely through the action of the four physical forces acting upon various molecules. Back in the 19th century Mary Shelley wrote an early sci-fi thriller where one supposed that if all the proper organic parts were put together just so, then the power of a lightening bolt (a strong electro-magnetic force) would bring a monster to life. But Frankenstein was just a scary work of fiction. It doesn't happen. In the mid-20th century, Miller and Urey thought that it could be done by zapping a soup of well-chosen chemicals. They got amino acids and thought they just about had the problem solved. Unfortunately for materialists, mechanists, etc., it's over 40 years gone and still no sign of life in the petri dish. Which brings me to your next point.\n \n \n\n Chemicals can form more complicated chemicals, and, under the right conditions, have been known to form complicated structures.\n\n \n **\n Surely this is not news to you!?!\n \n \n\n For example, consider this quote (from http://www.theharbinger.org/articles/rel_sci/fox.html):\"Figure 2.

Not so. Things are not alive just because they look like things that are. It is quite silly, childish, and/or primitive to make that mistake. \n \n \n\n Unfortunately (for me), I do not have the time for a long discussion of abiogenesis right now.\n Examine the site and consider the evidence before falling back on potentially faulty logical arguments.\n\n \n **\n And you please examine your own posts before saying anything else as inane as was what you've just said here.",

For one, your definition may describe emergence in physical systems, but it does not explain it. Furthermore, your definition of emergent behaviour seems simply to describe everyday chemistry. If so, then it is redundant. IAC, your definition is not the one normally given for the term, even by materialists. I believe their standard definition goes--\"emergence- Properties of a complex physical system are emergent just in case they are neither (i) properties had by any parts of the system taken in isolation nor (ii) resultant of _a mere summation of properties of parts_ of the system.\" That is, an emergent property is one that is not found within the sum of a system's composite parts. So far, so good, but materialists have nothing but the sum of any physical system's original parts, including it's complement of physical forces, to work with.

   "For one, your definition may describe emergence in physical systems, but it does not explain it.\n\n \n The rules of the system explain the emergent behaviour. There is no gap to be filled with further explanation. \n \n \n\"emergence- Properties of a complex physical system are emergent just in case they are neither (i) properties had by any parts of the system taken in isolation nor (ii) resultant of _a mere summation of properties of parts_ of the system.\" That is, an emergent property is one that is not found within the sum of a system's composite parts.\n\n \n On reflection my choice of words was poor, but at least some of the blame for this misunderstanding lies with whoever gave you that definition! For, while strictly correct, it admits your (quite understandable) erroneous interpretation.\n \n The definition states that emergent properties are not \"resultant of a mere summation of properties of parts of the system.\" This is intended to exclude the trivial and expected: mix cold white milk with hot, brown liquid and you get a warm, light-brown drink. It's not emergent, it's just tea.\n \n However, take a remedially simple mathematical equation on the 2D plane, the rule 'iterate until it exceeds |2|', and what emerges is an unexpected infinity of beautiful detail: the Mandlebrot Set. Nothing in the individual system components, or even the full instructions, is suggestive of complexity or pattern - yet complexity and pattern arise. The page linked above gives other examples.\n \n Returning to evolution: \n \n Random mutation, in isolation, I would cheerfully describe as entropic. Selection (arising as an inevitability from finite resources and limited successful breeding), in isolation, is powerless: without variation it achieves nothing. Even taken together, one might expect RM or NS to overpower the other: NS ruthlessly weeding out the sub-optimal, or RM exceeding NS's regulatory influence. The final component is variability of environment, which can not only redefine what 'fittest' means, but can also strengthen or weaken the regulatory influence of NS.\n \n When I spoke of genomes 'exploring neighbouring genetic space', I merely referred to the random accumulation of neutral mutations - neutral in that environmental context. The Tanganyika cichlids are a marvellous real world example of this.\n \n Finding themselves in a vast, rich, largely predator-free environment, many more cichlid offspring than usual would survive to breed. RM relatively unchecked by NS resulted in wild diversification. But as the population mushroomed, competition for resources inevitably increased, gradually tightening NS's grip once more. Previously neutral mutations, or combinations thereof inherited through interbreeding, were gradually exposed as advantageous or deletorious in a competitive environment. Their increased statistical influence on reproductive rates inevitably led to their prominence or decline within the gene pool.\n \n We need no additional force to explain this sequence of events. The mere relaxation and reapplication of NS, through environmental change, is enough.\n \n \nFirst, you are confusing the force, Vitality, and the intelligence it bestows upon a living organism. Vitality does not \"recognise\" (as you put it) \"distinct organisms\". It enables them to operate as dynamic systems.\n\n \n If so, why has this never been observed? Why have environmentally-cued morphological changes been traced to pre-existing chemically sensitive regulatory genes?\n \n I'm also intrigued by your distinction between the 'vitality' force and the 'intelligence it bestows'. Wouldn't that count as an emergent property, since it is possessed by neither the organism nor the force that allegedly invigorates it?\n \n \nenabling future prediction when given the same set of initial conditions. In short, what distinguishes Gravity, etc., from magic, is what distinguishes Vitality from magic.\n\n \n For a hypothesis to be useful, it must say more than just 'the same thing will happen again given the same set of initial conditions'. We must be able to vary the initial conditions and have our hypothesis predict the outcome. Such is not the case with 'vitality', where:\n \n 1. Bacterium + Vitality = organism able to perceive its environment at a molecular level, intelligently deduce what changes to its own structure would most benefit it, and then enact those changes (ignoring for the moment the fact that in the laboratory, no such behaviour occurs).\n \n Yet:\n \n 2. The failure of the Pa Dong tribe to lengthen their necks even slightly despite years of diligent effort.\n \n Also, how does vitality account for our ability to reanimate a clinically dead human being through the application of chemicals and electric current (providing the physical structures of his body are not too far degraded)? Given an initially barren universe, where did vitality come from? Where does it go when we die? In a complex organism, most of the actual cells are still alive after death has occurred; it is only their organised activity that has been disrupted. How are that 'organisation', and the chemical activity within a single bacterium, sufficiently analogous to allow both to harness 'vitality'?\n \n Returning to an earlier post:\n \n \nI, myself, in this debate, am not required to provide the mechanical details, i.e., the biochemistry, the nuclear biology, whatever, required to flesh out my basic premise, any more than Darwin was required to provide the physics and chemistry of \"Natural Selection\".\n\n \n If neither you nor I are knowledgeable enough to describe the precise mechanical processes supporting our hypotheses, what justifies your insistence that mechanical processes alone are insufficient? If you don't understand biogenetics and biochemistry, how can you claim they don't account for every difference we perceive between animate and inanimate entities? \n \n To put it another way: why isn't vitalism the conclusion reached by those most knowledgable in their fields? Why don't such people perceive the 'gap' that you insist vitality must fill?",

   "I hope you won't mind the interjection of an observer of this thread.\n\n \n **\n Hi colin;\n Please feel free to join in. Anyone with anything serious to say is welcome.\n \n \n\n Please clarify what you mean by the \"intelligence\" Vitality provides organisms with.\n\n \n **\n It may help to look at it this way. As I see it, Vitality(a universal force) is to intelligence (a local phenomenon) what Gravity(a universal force) is to weight(a local phenomenon). Just as gravity remains the same (FAPP) across the world, but the weights of different things vary, so too with Vitality and the intelligence of organisms.\n There has long been an anthropocentric tendency to define 'intelligence' in strictly human terms--that is, in terms of self-conscious analytical thought as applied to problem-solving, particulary with regard to the manipulation of abstractions and symbols. Readin', 'ritin', & 'rithmetic, so to speak. In the 20th century we began to admit that we were not the only intelligent creatures out there, but it has been a slow process that has encountered mountainous resistance among those who wish to reserve intelligence to the human race alone, and so continue to arbitrarily define intelligence in strictly human terms in order to do so. Let's say, as creatures that have brains. To me that's just a dishonest, self-serving device, along the lines of defining humans as beings who have college degrees. Or white skin. Or whatever.\n \n I think it more honest to simply define intelligence as a live organism's capacity or power to deal with the demands, both internal and external, that are made upon it by the world, WRT its ambition (usually unconscious), to survive, thrive, and (usually) to reproduce. \n \n \n\n As far as I am aware, single-celled organisms like bacteria don't have any intelligence whatsoever.\n\n \n **\n There is no reason to think that way, once you alter your definition of intelligence. Even the simplest organisms and single cells are dynamic systems, i.e., autopoietic, self-organizing, self-sustaining, and self-directing systems at that. They are teleological entities, and there simply cannot be teleology without intelligence, by its very nature.\n \n Moreover, bacteria tend to be 'eusocial'. That means that the basic organism is not the single cell, but the overall colony, as a collectivity. Up until about 20 years ago bacteriology saw each cell as an individual animal, (at least in prokaryotes, though not in eukaryotes, like us). But mountains of evidence show that the comparison is more apt if we see the individual bacterium like an individual human cell, and the colony as a whole as more like an individual \n human being, so to speak. There is quite a bit of material out there now on the collective intelligence of eusocial bacteria. Google \"quorum sensing\", to start off with.\n \n At the same time individual cells, including bacterial cells, each possess their own level of intelligence, sufficient to each to continue to pursue their general life goals. That is, to do what they need to do in order to survive, thrive, and reproduce, providing it suits the overall life goals of the collective community, the colony, the corpus, the ' multi-celled organism', to survive, thrive, and reproduce.\n \n Hope this helps, and feel free to contribute.",

'Adaptability' serves perfectly well, without the attendant baggage of implied conscious intent.\n \n Moreover, analysis of the biosphere reveals the most 'intelligent' creatures - by your definition - to be almost without exception the least conventionally intelligent, with the simplest, least meta-structured forms, and the highest infant mortality rates. Only humans, with their conventionally intelligent ability to model, predict and change their environment, could be judged to come anywhere close.\n \n Adaptability, it would seem, goes hand-in-hand with a scattergun approach to reproduction where most offspring die: why would we see this pattern if even the simplest living things are able to detect, evaluate and self-modify in response to their environment?\n \n \nThey are teleological entities, and there simply cannot be teleology without intelligence, by its very nature.\n\n \n From this page:\n \n \nIn evolution, the question 'why do organisms exhibit adaptation?' is not answered teleologically with 'in order to survive', but historically - 'because those that were less adaptive didn't survive'. However, some forms of teleology are still used, on the understanding that they reduce to historical explanations.\n\n \n Dawkins pointed out (in The God Delusion; I apologise for not having the page number to hand) that humans are predisposed to perceive teleology (intent or purpose) where none exist, and hypothesised that, rather like our predisposition to see faces or figures in patterns of light and shadow, this might be because in both cases a false positive is a waste of time, whereas a false negative might be fatal.\n \n Whatever the reason, it is hard to dispute the fact that we are prone to seeing intent where none exists; ask any bible-belt tornado-survivor. \n \n \nVitality I call individual, local, intelligence. This intelligence varies from organism to organism, as all traits do, from simple cells to human beings, but all living things have it to some degree, while all inanimate things do not. N.B.--Do not anthropomorphise, and suppose that human intelligence is the be-all and end-all, or suppose that any intelligence possessed by any non-human is merely a diminished quantity of human intelligence. Self-conciousness and analytical thought are not necessary to intelligent organisms.\n\n \n Isn't it an equal anthropomorphism to attribute intent and purpose - teleological behaviour - to every plant, fungus and bacterium, and from that infer intelligence? Artificial creatures in a simulated environment - nothing more than ones and zeros - evolve and adapt too; are they harnessing vitality?\n \n It seems to me that the 'driving force' you deem necessary, and unique to living organisms, is adequately covered by the observation that a self-replicating molecule in the presence of resources will self-replicate. Our 'drive' to do the same, though it seems teleological, can equally well be described historically: organisms less predisposed to reproduce are overrun by those that are.",

   "The rules of the system explain the emergent behaviour. There is no gap to be filled with further explanation. \n\n \n **\n From your wiki citation--\n \"Like intelligence in AI, or agents in DAI, emergence is a central concept in complex systems yet is hard to define and very controversial. There is no scientific consensus about what weak and strong forms of emergence are, or about how much emergence should be relied upon as an explanation in general. It seems impossible to unambiguously decide whether a phenomenon should be considered emergent.\n \n Further, \"emergent\" is not always a deeply explanatory label even when it is agreed on: the more complex the phenomenon is, the more intricate are the underlying processes, and the less effective the word emergence is alone. In fact, calling a phenomenon emergent is sometimes used in lieu of a more meaningful explanation. See also: self-organization.\"\n In short 'emergence' is commonly used device wherebye a physical mystery is evaded by the use of a word or label. As in, if you'll forgive me, \"Natural Selection\", etc. But even if physical emergence, such as that of salt from sodium and chlorine, could be explained through the mechanics of the electro-magnetic force and/or the two nuclear forces, (and since I am neither chemist nor nuclear physicist, I don't know, and I suspect that they cannot or the phenomenon would not be considered mysterious and their would be no need for the term), the application of 'emergence' in physical terms, as in molecules, does not, or should not, carry over into biological systems.\n \n As above, the more complex the system, the less useful (i.e., explanatory) and the more evasive the term becomes. There are no systems more complex than autopoietic systems; that is, biosystems. 'Bottom-up emergence', from atoms to molecules, etc., simply doesn't work with life and death and all the psychical phenomena associated with life, no matter how much materialists, whose POV requires that everything be 'bottom-up', from inert 'matter' to whatever, demand that it should be. The physicalist/mechanist definition of 'emergence' is utterly useless where real 'emergence' is found, as in the origin of life on earth. But that case, and others where a qualitative change in reality is found that in no way can be accounted for by any quantification of all that was before, is the only real description of 'emergence', and the description does not explain the change itself. This really applies to everything, from the development of traits like human intelligence, to the entire process of evolution itself.\n \n \n\n On reflection my choice of words was poor, but at least some of the blame for this misunderstanding lies with whoever gave you that definition! For, while strictly correct, it admits your (quite understandable) erroneous interpretation.\n \n The definition states that emergent properties are not \"resultant of a mere summation of properties of parts of the system.\" This is intended to exclude the trivial and expected: mix cold white milk with hot, brown liquid and you get a warm, light-brown drink. It's not emergent, it's just tea.\n \n However, take a remedially simple mathematical equation on the 2D plane, the rule 'iterate until it exceeds |2|', and what emerges is an unexpected infinity of beautiful detail: the Mandlebrot Set. Nothing in the individual system components, or even the full instructions, is suggestive of complexity or pattern - yet complexity and pattern arise. The page linked above gives other examples.\n\n \n **\n Yes, they do arise. And human intelligence and long giraffe necks amnd bats arise. The fact is no explanation for itself. How do you explain Mandelbrot and biological evolution, besides merely describing it, in words or mathematical symbology?\n \n \n\n Returning to evolution: \n \n Random mutation, in isolation, I would cheerfully describe as entropic.\n\n \n **\n Good. Now we're making a start.\n \n \n\n Selection (arising as an inevitability from finite resources and limited successful breeding), in isolation, is powerless:\n\n \n **\n What do you mean by this word, \"selection\". In common usage 'selection' is a cognate of 'to select' which a synonym of 'to choose'. Neither are synonyms of 'to sort', and there is a reason for that--'to sort' is a behaviour that can be done automatically, mechanically, relying solely upon one or more of the four physical forces. Eg., hydrodynamics 'sort' the material deposited on stream bottoms. In any purely materialist/physicalist/mechanist/naturalist/positivist scenarion, 'sorting' is all that ever really happens in the natural world, and 'sorting' is not 'selecting' or 'choosing'. There needs must be alternative behaviours from which a 'choice' or 'selection' may be deliberately made, on the basis of criteria of judgement developed by prior experience and learning, before, in plain English, any choice or selection, conscious or unconscious, can ever be made.\n \n Since materialists etc. do not accept the ultimate reality of psychical phenomena, but call them merely 'epiphenomena' of physical phenomena, they have no right to say 'selection' when they mean mechanical 'sorting', and no right to pretend that their biological \"selection\" is somehow every bit as mechanically determinist, i.e., regular and predictable, as hydrodynamics or planetary motion. The empirical facts of the natural world contradict this false assertion every time, and in every place. In the end, the this false use of a perfectly meaningful English word, Humpty Dumpty fashion, does nothing more than label how many pins are still standing after the bowling ball stops moving. And I agree with you on this--that there will _inevitably_ be _a_ number, say from zero to ten, after that ball stops moving. But that's neither 'rocket science' nor evolutionary biology.\n \n \n \n\n without variation it achieves nothing.\n\n \n **\n Are you therefore agreeing with me that \"NS\" cannot account for origins, and is therefore neither an explanation, nor a physical mechanism, for evolution?\n Contra Darwin and the Neo-Darwinists?\n \n \n\n Even taken together, one might expect RM or NS to overpower the other: NS ruthlessly weeding out the sub-optimal,\n\n \n **\n Where in the real, non-hypotheyical world of empirical science do you find this \" NS ruthlessly weeding out the sub-optimal\"?!? None of the field studies I've ever read have ever demonstrated that one or more individuals having a minor trait difference (minor, as demanded by \"NS\" theory itself), ever accounted for the difference between living to a ripe old age and dying young.\n To the contrary, every study I've seen, albeit I haven't looked in many years, demonstrated conclusively that lifespan what strictly chance-dependent, a matter of pure, blind, luck, i.e., random strokes of fortune.\n The only semi-acceptable exceptions were found in cases of general catastrophe, in which, not through cumulative, 'selection', but by chance of birth (luck), some organisms survived what others did not. But that is meaningless, since in every race there is a winner and losers, and that fact, per se, does not explain anything.\n The fact of the matter is this--your statement would read more accurately phrased thus, \"[Lady Luck] ruthlessly weeding out the [unlucky]\".\n \n \n\n or RM exceeding NS's regulatory influence. The final component is variability of environment, which can not only redefine what 'fittest' means, but can also strengthen or weaken the regulatory influence of NS.\n\n \n **\n Meaning that the randomness of the state of any local environment, especially any individual organism's local environment [its 'umwelt'] makes every designation of 'fit' relative and anomalous, i.e., scientifically useless. And there is no \"regulatory influence\" in \"NS\", since to claim that there is, is to turn \"NS\" into a teleological actor with ends, goals, and decided preferences.\n \n I have to stop now. I'm sorry to have to say so much about your posts, but the fact is that what you say is so loaded with (apparently unconscious) assumptions that they must be mined thoroughly before we can proceed from one to the next.\n \n But I am enjoying this conversation very much, and will try to get back to the rest of this post ASAP.",

So your above equation should read:- corporeal complex system + Vitality= live bacterium. Or live cell, or live organism of whatever kind. In which case your statement should then continue thus:--\n \"[ a live] organism able to perceive[if by that you mean 'sense'] its environment at a molecular level[I believe that that is the fundamental level at which all senses operate, including our own five], intelligently deduce...\"\n Whoa!\n I suspected that by \"perceive\" you were trying to insinuate conscious awareness, and you have confirmed that suspicion with your \"deduce\", which does not merely imply, but demands consciously, deliberately, directed analytical thought. That is, _human_ mentation.\n Again and again I must remind people that intelligence, awareness, and volition do not entail consciousness. Indeed, consciousness is a very highly honed level of intelligence, etc., that depends an extremely sophisticated mechanical design, such as the human brain, to enable an organism to 'harness' Vitality so as to produce intelligent behaviour at that advanced level. But just because a bacterium does not have a brain does not mean that its system design, its componetry, plus Vitality, do not produce life, and with it a much more primitive, but equally real, intelligence.\n \n \n\n what changes to its own structure would most benefit it,\n\n \n **\n I do not pretend, as I think I've already pointed out, to know the chemical and molecular details of just how life operates in living things. But I'm not apologising, because I do not need to know. It is sufficient to my purposes to demonstrate that life processes are real, and that they need to be driven by a force above and beyond the four physical forces. That \"unknown\" force that that satisfactorily fulfills that dynamically necessary condition I have labelled \"Vitality\", as a tip of the hat to the long history of Vitalism.\n \n Moreover, as already described, the process of evolution as seen in a neo-lamarckian devo-evo perspective, is that maladaptation stimulates change in behaviour and experimentation, successful or partially successful organismic experimentation continuously iterated cause physical changes in both the organism and in its developing offspring. That's fact. I don't know how, but then I don't know how callouses form, either. My body does, though, thank heaven! \n \n \n\n and then enact those changes (ignoring for the moment the fact that in the laboratory, no such behaviour occurs).\n\n \n **\n How do you know that no such behaviour occurs in labs? I suggest that it happens constantly, not only in the wild, but also in any number of bacterial experiments in which the observed changes are falsely assumed to be the product of RM+NS.\n \n \n\n Yet:\n \n 2. The failure of the Pa Dong tribe to lengthen their necks even slightly despite years of diligent effort.\n\n \n **\n This is Weismann's silly strawman all over again. Artificial, externally imposed [by fashion, egotism, in this case] physical changes are never adopted by the body. Only those it generates _itself_ in response to a chronic and robust environmental stimulus lead to physical changes in self that are passed on epigenetically, by devo-evo, to offspring. Even Lamarck, 200 years ago, never said that scars, circumcised foreskins, or chopped-off tails would lead to heavily scarred offspring, jews like Weismann born without foreskins, or tail-less mice. Or as in your example, Pa Dong baby girls born with preternaturally long necks. BTW, these women do lengthen their necks, even to the point that without the rings the weight of their heads snaps their necks. They just can't convince their bodies to make such dangerous necks for them and their female offspring.\n \n \n\n Also, how does vitality account for our ability to reanimate a clinically dead human being through the application of chemicals and electric current (providing the physical structures of his body are not too far degraded)? \n\n \n **\n Oh, please, now you're being disingenuous. You know very well that \"clinically dead\" is not \"dead dead\". \"[T]oo far degraded\" is just another way of saying \"dead dead\".\n \n \n\n Given an initially barren universe, where did vitality come from?\n\n \n **\n The same place as everything else, including Gravity, etc. That ultimate source of everything is up for debate, of course, but in some other thread.\n Now, if you are a diehard materialist/physicalist you will claim that matter is the source of gravity, electrons the source of electro-magnetism, and atomic nucleii the source of the two nuclear forces. I would say, au contraire, that gravity is the source of matter, etc., and that forces always are the causes that precede their material products--including electrons and atomic nucleii.\n Therefore vitality existed prior to any lifeforms, as I see it.\n \n \n\n Where does it go when we die?\n\n \n **\n How should I know?!? Where does the flame go when you blow out the candles? \"Ou sont les neiges d'antan?\"\n \n \n\n In a complex organism, most of the actual cells are still alive after death has occurred; it is only their organised activity that has been disrupted.\n\n \n **\n See?!? I kew that you knew the difference between \"clinically dead\" and 'really dead'.\n \n \n\n How are that 'organisation', and the chemical activity within a single bacterium, sufficiently analogous to allow both to harness 'vitality'?\n\n \n **\n It is the organized system of chemical parts that, infused with vitality, operates as a living biosystem. One that can direct that same vitality to behaviours that sometimes can enable it to better survive, thrive, and reproduce. Since vitality is non-corporeal all organisms can 'contain' the same 'amount' of vitality without ever exhausting the original amount through reproduction. Just as, by analogy, you can light ten candles from one, without its own flame diminishing. The chief difference in biosystems lies in the advanced ability of different organisms to translate the energy of vitality into more psychical phenomena than others can, and that advanced ability generally depends upon better physical 'processing power', from better physical 'plants'-- such as brains and bigger brains and whatever.\n \n \n\n Returning to an earlier post:\n \n \n Quote:\n I, myself, in this debate, am not required to provide the mechanical details, i.e., the biochemistry, the nuclear biology, whatever, required to flesh out my basic premise, any more than Darwin was required to provide the physics and chemistry of \"Natural Selection\". \n \n \n If neither you nor I are knowledgeable enough to describe the precise mechanical processes supporting our hypotheses, what justifies your insistence that mechanical processes alone are insufficient?\n\n \n **\n As I've said before. Because the mechanics of the for physical forces operate identically on the live, the dead, and the inanimate, equally and indistinguishably. But live organisms act differently than dead and inanimate entities. Chiefly, they are dynamic, not passive. Therefore something apart from the four physical forces is necessary to account for this difference. I don't have to be omniscient in cellular biology and molecular biology in order to figure that out.\n \n \n\n If you don't understand biogenetics and biochemistry, how can you claim they don't account for every difference we perceive between animate and inanimate entities? \n\n \n **\n As above.\n \n \n\n To put it another way: why isn't vitalism the conclusion reached by those most knowledgable in their fields?\n\n \n **\n Are you making a false appeal to authority or popularity? Obviously if most biologists are, paradoxically, materialist/mechanist/positivists, then it stands to reason that they will resist vitalism and dynamism, their mortal metaphysical enemies, with tooth and claw and any brick or bottle they can lay their hands on. It's either that or admit that they've been dead wrong, biologically and philosophically, right from the jump. To do that would be to abandon their own identities; they'll never do that.\n \n \n \n\n Why don't such people perceive the 'gap' that you insist vitality must fill?\n\n \n **\n Good question. Intentional blindness from an inability to face up to a mortal challenge to their philosophy is about all I can come up with. I mean, you don't have to be an Einstein to figure it out, for pete's sake!\n \n I'm worn out. It's quite late here, and now that I've completed this post of yours I'm off to bed.",

   "In short 'emergence' is commonly used device wherebye a physical mystery is evaded by the use of a word or label.\n\n \n The quote you reference does not support that interpretation. Emergence is sometimes used in lieu of a more detailed explanation, and there is some disagreement over its precise scope. There is also some disagreement over the gravitational constant, but that does not prevent us applying it usefully. Emergent properties and behaviour are, in the context I used the terms, nothing more than unexpected complexity arising through the interation of simple rules or entities. 'Unexpected' is the key point you seem to be missing: it represents a failure of our minds to predict the behaviour from an inspection of the rules, not the magical creation of complexity where none existed before\n \n \nthe application of 'emergence' in physical terms, as in molecules, does not, or should not, carry over into biological systems.\n\n \n You'll recall that I did not claim emergence as an explanation for abiogenesis. I described the process of evolution as emerging from the interaction of random mutation and natural selection.\n \n Even so, this seems circular reasoning: you say emergent properties or behaviour don't apply to biological systems because they're 'different' (they have 'vitality'), yet at the same time you support your claim for 'vitality' by pointing out the gap left when you deny the validity of emergence.\n \n \nThe physicalist/mechanist definition of 'emergence' is utterly useless where real 'emergence' is found, as in the origin of life on earth. But that case, and others where a qualitative change in reality is found that in no way can be accounted for by any quantification of all that was before, is the only real description of 'emergence', and the description does not explain the change itself.\n\n \n Here you make an unsupportable assumption: that it is impossible for molecules to find themselves arranged in a self-replicating structure without a qualitative change occurring. This is patently false: the simplest computer 'life' simulation randomly produces self-replicating, mobile configurations of 'matter' which are constitutionally indistinguishable from their inanimate neighbours.\n \n A television set is a television set because of the way its molecules are configured, not because it has some special 'TV matter' or 'TV force' telling it what to be. Microchips include no qualitative novelty, yet they perform tasks no lump of rock ever could. One should not underestimate the power of everyday matter, appropriately configured.\n \n \nHow do you explain Mandelbrot ... besides merely describing it, in words or mathematical symbology?\n\n \n Why does it even make sense to ask for an explanation? The rules to create the Mandlebrot pattern are all right there; the result is merely unexpectedly complex and pretty. What the set tells us is that tiny changes to input can lead to big differences in output; it was one of the first clues in the puzzle we sometimes call Chaos Theory.\n \n Mandlebrot demonstrates that, counter-intuitively, ordered complexity can arise from the interaction of simple rules. Even if we accept the need for (and absence of) an explanation, here we have proof positive of what you so vehemently deny: that complexity can arise from simplicity without qualitative change.\n \n \nWhat do you mean by this word, \"selection\". In common usage 'selection' is a cognate of 'to select' which a synonym of 'to choose'. Neither are synonyms of 'to sort', and there is a reason for that--'to sort' is a behaviour that can be done automatically, mechanically, relying solely upon one or more of the four physical forces. <snip< There needs must be alternative behaviours from which a 'choice' or 'selection' may be deliberately made, on the basis of criteria of judgement developed by prior experience and learning, before, in plain English, any choice or selection, conscious or unconscious, can ever be made.\n\n \n Two points here:\n \n First, the origin of the term Natural Selection:\n \n \nThe phrase 'survival of the fittest' was not even Darwin's. It was urged on him by Wallace, the codiscoverer of natural selection, who hated 'natural selection' because he thought it implied that something was doing the selecting. Darwin coined the term 'natural selection' because had made an analogy with 'artificial selection' as done by breeders, an analogy Wallace hadn't made when he developed his version of the theory.\n\n \n Secondly, the semantic disparity between 'sorting' (which you allow as a mechanical process) and 'selecting' (which you do not) is accounted for in biology by the fact that the consequence of a genome being unfavourably 'sorted' is its abatement in the gene pool. Consider a sieve suspended above an incinerator: the sieve sorts, but the combination of sieve and incinerator selects.\n \n \nwithout variation it <NS< achieves nothing.\n \n Are you therefore agreeing with me that \"NS\" cannot account for origins, and is therefore neither an explanation, nor a physical mechanism, for evolution?\n Contra Darwin and the Neo-Darwinists?\n\n \n I fear I will have to be just a little rude here: did you even parse the sentence before replying to it?\n \n Without genetic variation, evolution cannot occur. There would be no genes statistically more or less likely to breed because they are all the same. NS is the accumulated statistical effect of generations of breeding.\n \n When you speak of 'origins', are you talking about abiogenesis, or evolution? Because RM+NS is a mechanism to explain the latter, not the former.\n \n \nWhere in the real, non-hypotheyical world of empirical science do you find this \" NS ruthlessly weeding out the sub-optimal\"?!?\n\n \n Er, nowhere: that's why I said \"one might expect\", rather than \"one finds\". My statement was part of a larger paragraph dealing with a couple of common anti-evolutionary misconceptions: first, that because NS inhibits change, it cannot be part of a system that promotes evolution. The second is more subtle: the false assertion that for evolution to occur, mutation and selection must preserve a fine and eternal balance.\n \n \nMeaning that the randomness of the state of any local environment, especially any individual organism's local environment [its 'umwelt'] makes every designation of 'fit' relative and anomalous, i.e., scientifically useless. And there is no \"regulatory influence\" in \"NS\", since to claim that there is, is to turn \"NS\" into a teleological actor with ends, goals, and decided preferences.\n\n \n Wrong on both counts, I'm afraid. \n \n First, genes need only confer a statistical breeding advantage to rise to prominence in a population, and most creatures in a breeding population experience similar environmental conditions during their lifetime. What is advantageous to one is likely to be advantageous to another, regardless of the precise configuration of their surroundings. Also, your contention that a creature's individual environment is too unique to support NS would be equally fatal to vitalism (assuming further evidence were even needed), since Lamarckian adaptation would then predict variation and speciation to a degree not empirically observable.\n \n Secondly, you continue to confuse inevitabilities with teleology. Not everything that achieves an effect must intend to do so. Did the sun intend to ignite as it accumulated matter? Or the practical upper limit of size/bulk for creatures without a circulatory system - is this intentional? Do snowflakes 'intend' to form complex shapes?\n \n NS is not a conscious actor, it is, as I have said, merely the cumulative effect of the statistical influence of genes upon reproductive rates. If you can show me how a gene can have a statistical influence on reproductive rates, and not vary in frequency in subsequent generations, I'll entertain your proposition that something more is required.\n \n \nOh? Is there no variety of traits, including intelligence, among the different, but all autopoietic, life forms we observe on this planet?\n\n \n Sorry, but that's no response at all to the point I made. \n \n I said that for a hypothesis to be useful it must do more than predict the same outcome given the same initial conditions. I can say just that: \"The same outcome will occur, given the same initial conditions\", and it is as usefully predictive as your vitalism hypothesis.\n \n \nYou never have a living organism, including a bacterium, _plus_ Vitality. An organism, even a single cell is composed of the interconnected physical parts of a system, plus Vitality.\n\n \n Given that you've just used the same word, 'plus', yourself, what's wrong with me using it? \n \n My position is that a bacterium is just what it looks like, and evolves via RM+NS. For it to be what you want it to be, it must be what I think it is, plus vitality - and the addition of vitality supposedly enables it to do all the extra things you think it can: deliberately reshape itself and its genome to better suit its environment.\n \n \nWhoa! I suspected that by \"perceive\" you were trying to insinuate conscious awareness, and you have confirmed that suspicion with your \"deduce\", which does not merely imply, but demands consciously, deliberately, directed analytical thought. That is, _human_ mentation.\n\n \n This is sheer nonsense. Whether something recognisable as a human consciousness is detecting the environment and choosing the appropriate genetic response, or some hypothetical combination of matter and 'vitality' is irrelevant. The deterministic link you propose between the infinite variety, types and levels of abstraction of possible environmental stimuli, and the changes to the genome they would have to cause in response, is so mind-blowingly complex as to be indistinguishable from a vast, brooding intelligence. Where did this insanely complex mechanism come from, and why can't we see any evidence of it?\n \n Take the mutation that resulted in certain bacteria being able to digest nylon: according to you, some mechanism bound up in those bacteria detected the presence of nylon and adjusted one of its genes just so to make it capable of processing that material. Nylon: a man made fibre, never before encountered in the history of life - yet this mystical intelligence (your word, not mine), was able to correctly alter just the right gene.\n \n Not only does your hypothesis require an evolutionary mechanism inconceivably more complex than RM+NS, it doesn't make the slightest bit of empirical sense. The nylon-eating mutation was found in just one location, despite those same bacteria encountering nylon on a regular basis all over the world - and starving to death for lack of sustenance.\n \n \nIt is sufficient to my purposes to demonstrate that life processes are real, and that they need to be driven by a force above and beyond the four physical forces.\n\n \n Which you have yet to do.\n \n \nMoreover, as already described, the process of evolution as seen in a neo-lamarckian devo-evo perspective, is that maladaptation stimulates change in behaviour and experimentation, successful or partially successful organismic experimentation continuously iterated cause physical changes in both the organism and in its developing offspring. That's fact.\n\n \n No, it isn't.\n \n Changes in behaviour can cause physical changes to an organism. If I pump iron, I gain muscle. But the propensity to achieve this is already encoded in my genes, and no matter how much iron I pump, my children will not be any more muscular unless they, too, pump iron.\n \n In some cases, chemically sensitive regulatory genes are observed to be stimulated in both the parent organism and the bud-cells that will later become offspring. Hence the 'spiny fly' example from earlier in the thread, where a predatory response is chemically, rather than genetically, 'inherited' through several generations. But spininess and non-spininess are both encoded in the fly's genes, which are passed on intact (barring random mutation) to the offspring.\n \n \nHow do you know that no such behaviour occurs in labs? I suggest that it happens constantly, not only in the wild, but also in any number of bacterial experiments in which the observed changes are falsely assumed to be the product of RM+NS.\n\n \n Lamarckism relies on a particular sequence of cause and effect: environmental change, then behavioural change, then morhpological change, then genetic change.\n \n Darwinism (or the Modern Synthesis) works differently. Mutations occur all the time. If they are detrimental to reproductive success in the current environment, they will inevitably tend to be found in a smaller proportion of successive generations (though if the disadvantage they confer is small, they may not be entirely eliminated). If they are beneficial, they will inevitably tend to be found in a larger proportion of successive generations. Thus adaptation can occur after a change in environment. If mutations are more or less neutral in that environment, they will tend to hang around in the gene pool (though by chance they may be eliminated). \n \n If the environment changes, previously neutral (or even mildly detrimental) mutations may actually confer an advantage - or conversely a disadvantage, and will be subject to the same statistical influences. Thus adaptation can occur before a change in environment.\n \n Just in case you were about to, please don't claim I'm endowing darwinian evolution with precognition; that's a hideous strawman.\n \n To return to your question, then: we can - and do - distinguish Darwinism from Lamarckism in the lab by the simple observation that accidentally adapted strains of organisms can be found in a population before a change in environment is imposed. I used 'accidental' rather than 'coincidental' intentionally, to make it clear that there is no temporal association.\n \n \nThis is Weismann's silly strawman all over again. Artificial, externally imposed [by fashion, egotism, in this case] physical changes are never adopted by the body. Only those it generates _itself_ in response to a chronic and robust environmental stimulus lead to physical changes in self that are passed on epigenetically, by devo-evo, to offspring.\n \n \n You endow your mysterious 'vital' force with greater and greater powers of discrimination. It can 'understand' (in the same sense that you say it is 'intelligent') that lengthening a neck to reach food would be a good thing to further reproduction, but turns its metaphorical nose up at the idea of lengthening a neck so as to be a more attractive mate, and thus also reproduce more successfully.\n \n \nBTW, these women do lengthen their necks, even to the point that without the rings the weight of their heads snaps their necks. They just can't convince their bodies to make such dangerous necks for them and their female offspring.\n\n \n Read the page I linked to. They do not lengthen their neck; that would result in slow paralysis. Neck extension is an illusion caused by deformation of the ribcage (which can deform without injury). X-rays confirm this.\n \n \nOh, please, now you're being disingenuous. You know very well that \"clinically dead\" is not \"dead dead\". \"[T]oo far degraded\" is just another way of saying \"dead dead\".\n\n \n I'm talking about a situation in which the organised activity within the body has ceased - the complex interactions you say harness 'vitality' to direct their future evolution (since cells within the body most certainly do not act in their individual best interests) are not there. Though cells may be functioning, the organism is not. Yet vitality can be restored chemically and electrically.\n \n \nSince vitality is non-corporeal all organisms can 'contain' the same 'amount' of vitality without ever exhausting the original amount through reproduction. Just as, by analogy, you can light ten candles from one, without its own flame diminishing.\n\n \n Lighting a candle is catalysing the liberation of stored energy. Are you saying that an organism, by reproducing, is catalysing the latent 'vitality' within the inanimate resources it consumes?\n \n \nBut live organisms act differently than dead and inanimate entities.\n\n \n A TV set acts differently to a rock. A simulated organism acts differently to a simulated rock. It is all a matter of configuration.\n \n \nAre you making a false appeal to authority or popularity? Obviously if most biologists are, paradoxically, materialist/mechanist/positivists, then it stands to reason that they will resist vitalism and dynamism, their mortal metaphysical enemies,\n\n \n Lamarckism is not a new idea meeting entrenched resistance. It is an old idea - older than Darwinism, and long-since shown to be an unnecessary complication that moreover fails to accord with observation.\n \n Finally, here's a few of the points that remain extant from my previous posts:\n \n \nWhy have environmentally-cued morphological changes been traced to pre-existing chemically sensitive regulatory genes?\n\n \n \nI'm also intrigued by your distinction between the 'vitality' force and the 'intelligence it bestows'. Wouldn't that count as an emergent property, since it is possessed by neither the organism nor the force that allegedly invigorates it?\n",

   "I'm not disputing that there is variance, but why hijack 'intelligence' as the term to describe that capacity? 'Adaptability' serves perfectly well, without the attendant baggage of implied conscious intent.\n\n \n **\n First, I was responding to collins request that I define 'intelligence'. I did. Compare my definition with Merriam-Webster's lead definition:-\n \" : the ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or trying situations\" \n Next, I would suggest to you that although 'adaptability' might be synonymous, to a degree, with this definition of basic 'intelligence', the definition of 'intelligence' expands beyond this level, the basic level of, 'adaptibility'.\n Also, it was 'intelligence' that was here first, and so any \"hijacking\" done, was done by those who replaced it with \"adaptability\" in order to escape the non-materialist implications of 'intelligence'.\n Finally, 'intelligence' has no \"attendant baggage of implied conscious intent\", except for those who still retain the 19th century notion that 'intelligence' is a trait reserved solely and uniquely to the human race, and that without the conscious, analytical thought of human intelligence, that no intelligence exists. Implying that what appears to be intelligence in other life forms is merely a passive, mechanical, 'going through the motions' that gives an illusory 'appearance' of 'intelligence'. \n \n \n\n Moreover, analysis of the biosphere reveals the most 'intelligent' creatures - by your definition - to be almost without exception the least conventionally intelligent, with the simplest, least meta-structured forms, and the highest infant mortality rates. Only humans, with their conventionally intelligent ability to model, predict and change their environment, could be judged to come anywhere close.\n\n \n **\n First you try to tell me that I should be saying \"adaptability\" when I say \"intelligence\", and now, in your very next breath, you are telling me that:-\"Moreover, analysis of the biosphere reveals the most 'intelligent' [adaptable]creatures - by your definition - to be almost without exception the least conventionally intelligent [adaptable], with the simplest, least meta-structured forms, and _the highest infant mortality rates_. \"!! I really can't follow the reasoning here! The whole thing seems like one long self-contradiction. Plus, the human beings are \" the most 'intelligent' creatures - by [my] definition \". Not only do we adapt ourselves, we 'adapt' our world to suit ourselves.\n \n \n\n Adaptability, it would seem, goes hand-in-hand with a scattergun approach to reproduction where most offspring die: why would we see this pattern if even the simplest living things are able to detect, evaluate and self-modify in response to their environment?\n\n \n **\n You are assuming that the goals of the individual should take precedence over the goals of the community as a whole. A very 18/19th century liberal\n POV, one still expressed today as 'libertarianism'. Where the goals of the community as a collective entity are to 'survive, thrive, and reproduce', those same goals in individual members are often superceded by those of group, for the sake of the greater good. See 'apoptosis' and 'altruism'. Another fact that goes directly contrary to the libertarian darwinian model of 'all [each individual] in deadly competition with all [every other individual] for 'scarce resources'. For many organic communities, a mass dissemination of seeds or live offspring in the hope that a few will survive, thrive, and reproduce, is the best, most intelligent, plan of action.\n \n \n\n Dawkins pointed out (in The God Delusion; I apologise for not having the page number to hand) that humans are predisposed to perceive teleology (intent or purpose) where none exist,\n\n \n **\n Dawkins has a right to his opinions, but there's no law saying that I have to accept them as gospel, so to speak.;) I would say instead that all organisms are predisposed to be at least unconsciously aware of 'cause and effect', that that awareness is a part of their intelligence, and that an awareness of 'cause and effect' is the very foundation of teleology.\n \n \n \n\n and hypothesised that, rather like our predisposition to see faces or figures in patterns of light and shadow, this might be because in both cases a false positive is a waste of time, whereas a false negative might be fatal.\n\n \n **\n Funny how, with Dawkins and other materialists, we are not allowed to believe what empirical observation tells us, because if whatever it is we see hear, or taste does not conform to materialist expectaions, then it must, perforce, be 'illusory'!! Things such as \"design\", \"teleology\", \"free will\", and, as at the start of this post, \"intelligence\".\n \n \n\n Whatever the reason, it is hard to dispute the fact that we are prone to seeing intent where none exists; ask any bible-belt tornado-survivor.\n\n \n The fact that we sometimes see what is not truly there does not mean that we only see what is not there, or even that we usually or mostly see what is not there. Not unless we're crazy, on drugs, or addicted to some very surreal worldview. Dawkins observation has no merit.\n \n \n\n Isn't it an equal anthropomorphism to attribute intent and purpose - teleological behaviour - to every plant, fungus and bacterium, and from that infer intelligence?\n\n \n **\n No. Not unless you start from an out-moded anthropocentric opinion that only human beings possess intent and purpose, i.e., volition. Try telling that to a polar bear that is creeping up behind you, licking her chops.\n \n \n\n Artificial creatures in a simulated environment - nothing more than ones and zeros - evolve and adapt too; are they harnessing vitality?\n\n \n **\n Yes. Their programmer's. Like all artefacts, they are ultimately the product of some organism's vitality, expressed as intelligent behaviour. \n Moreover, AI 'critters' aren't simply \"ones and zeroes\", and neither is their 'simulated environment'. The code used is not the message carried. Without that 'meaning', nothing evolves or adapts, and \"ones and zeroes\" are meaningless until an intelligence invests them with significance. Meaninglessness can never be anything other than what it is.\n \n \n\n It seems to me that the 'driving force' you deem necessary, and unique to living organisms, is adequately covered by the observation that a self-replicating molecule in the presence of resources will self-replicate. \n\n \n **\n I fail to see any necessary or sufficient connection between the mechanics of the inanimate and the dynamics of the animate. If you do, (and I can't see why you would), then we'll just have to disagree, since to me it is obvious that passive mechanical reactions at the molecular level have little in common with dynamic teleological activity at the systems level, especially at the level of autopoietic biosystems.\n \n \n\n Our 'drive' to do the same, though it seems teleological, can equally well be described historically: organisms less predisposed to reproduce are overrun by those that are.\n\n \n **\n Truisms are trivial, and tautologies explain nothing.",

I later said 'the least conventionally intelligent', using the word 'conventionally' to refer to the conventional definition of intelligence.\n \n Shorn of these bewildering literary contortions, the statement runs thus:\n \n Moreover, analysis of the biosphere reveals the most adaptable creatures, and hence by your revised definition the most intelligent, to be almost without exception the least conventionally, consciously intelligent, with the simplest, least meta-structured forms, and the highest infant mortality rates. \n \n Is that better?\n \n \nPlus, the human beings are \" the most 'intelligent' creatures - by [my] definition \". Not only do we adapt ourselves, we 'adapt' our world to suit ourselves.\n\n \n I said as much myself, but pointed out that we would be an anomalous entry. Assuming we were at the top, the next billion or so slots would be occupied by bacteria, which are capable of adapting to far greater extremes of environment than any other creature, and doing so much more rapidly (thanks to profligate reproduction and short intergenerational periods).\n \n \nYou are assuming that the goals of the individual should take precedence over the goals of the community as a whole.\n\n \n No, I'm not. I'm simply questioning how a bacteria is supposed to know whether to act in its own best interests or those of the colony. And please don't - forgive me - blather on about the semantics of 'know', or different kinds of intelligence; for a bacteria (even one infused with vitality) to act in response to its environment there must be, encoded somewhere in some form, a recogniser for that stimulus, what the response should be, and a mechanism for introducing it to the genome. Anything else is - as you put it - acausal and magical. \n \n Given the infinity of possible environmental stimuli - on an individual or group level, in chemical, physical or electromagnetic form - to which a bacteria might need to respond in the Lamarckian system, where are the recognisers? Where are the responses encoded? Why have we never seen them in action?\n \n \nThe fact that we sometimes see what is not truly there does not mean that we only see what is not there, or even that we usually or mostly see what is not there.\n\n \n Nobody is requiring that to be the case. What I am proposing is that you are, in this case, mistaking a mechanical method of arriving at success (RM+NS) for an intelligent one.\n \n \nNo. Not unless you start from an out-moded anthropocentric opinion that only human beings possess intent and purpose, i.e., volition. Try telling that to a polar bear that is creeping up behind you, licking her chops.\n\n \n Who mentioned polar bears? Who mentioned any higher-order, conventionally intelligent creatures? I talked about plants, fungi and bacteria, to which you are bent on attributing intelligence and intent.\n \n \nYes. Their programmer's. Like all artefacts, they are ultimately the product of some organism's vitality, expressed as intelligent behaviour.\n\n \n That's absurd. For a start, the programmer creates the environment, he does not program the organism. Certain random configurations within that environment turn out to be self-replicating, simply according to the mechanical rules of that environment. At the very least, there's a significant discontinuity of vitality. Some environments might be randomly barren; others might not be. What determines that? Configuration of simulated matter within those environments.\n \n \nMoreover, AI 'critters' aren't simply \"ones and zeroes\", and neither is their 'simulated environment'. The code used is not the message carried. Without that 'meaning', nothing evolves or adapts, and \"ones and zeroes\" are meaningless until an intelligence invests them with significance. Meaninglessness can never be anything other than what it is.\n\n \n The program expresses the rules of the environment, not the behaviour of organisms within it, or even what constitutes 'success' or 'meaning'. It is analogous to the laws of physics. Claiming that simulated organisms do not evolve or adapt is quite false - and we do not need to impose an external purpose for this to occur.\n \n For example, these days we use genetic algorithms to design all sorts of things, like microchips. In such cases you are right: we intelligently impose our own criteria for success, filter accordingly, and mutate. What you can't seem to grasp is that reproduction generates its own success criteria, without any intelligent input. You don't need any intelligence asking \"Can this reproduce? Yes, ok, make more like that; no, ok, put it in the bin\" because the things make more of themselves. Nor do you need anyone to start the process off; you just need a self-replicating molecule to arise by chance, and POW, off you go!\n \n \nsince to me it is obvious that passive mechanical reactions at the molecular level have little in common with dynamic teleological activity at the systems level, especially at the level of autopoietic biosystems.\n\n \n But given that you admittedly don't know how either of them work, how can you make that assertion?\n \n I'll leave it there for a while; I think I'm already a whole post ahead. I'll come back in a day or so, if that's OK.",

   "You are quite wrong to assign such an opinion to me. I'm fully aware that other animals do exhibit conscious intent in their behaviour, though generally to a far lesser degree than humans. We directly correlate that with intelligence: degrees of intentionality.\n \n I'm puzzled as to what fiddling with the definition of 'intelligence' is supposed to achieve.\n\n \n \n **\n What \"fiddling\" are you refering to, precisely?!? I've already taken pains to show that my definition and Merriam-Webster's match up. Apparently the only definition you have for 'intelligence' is that it equals 'adaptability'. I say that 'intelligence' enables 'adaptability', i.e., is the foundation of it, but we can see that it can and does enable much more than that in organisms with increasingly complex neuological systems. \n \n \n\n I say humans/chimps/cats etc are vastly more intelligent than bacteria. You say they're not,\n\n \n **\n Say what?!?!emoticon_confused Please quote where I so much as insinuated any such thing!!! I have repeated pointed the very opposite--that intelligence varies, not only from species to species, but also from individual to individual. Eg., Sam is more intelligent than Bob, and that border collie is more intelligent than this irish setter. Of course humans are more intelligent than monkeys, and monkeys more intelligent than an e.coli. colonies. I simply cannot imagine from where you got your erroneous impression of my position on this.\n \n \n \n\n but in order to be right you have to redefine intelligence.\n\n \n **\n No, I don't, and no, I did not.\n \n \n\n What's the point in taking a term that clearly does distinguish two organisms and redefining it so that they're the same?\n\n \n **\n I have no idea what you're talking about, but it probly depends upon your totally mistaken impression of my POV re 'intelligence', above.\n \n \nwabbit--\n \"First you try to tell me that I should be saying \"adaptability\" when I say \"intelligence\", and now, in your very next breath, you are telling me that:-\n \n peeling--\n \"Moreover, analysis of the biosphere reveals the most 'intelligent' [adaptable]creatures - by your definition - to be almost without exception the least conventionally intelligent [adaptable], with the simplest, least meta-structured forms, and _the highest infant mortality rates_. \"!! I really can't follow the reasoning here!\" \n \n peeling--\"Then read it more carefully.\"\n\n \n **\n Gee, I just did, and guess what? It still doesn't make any sense! Especially in the light of your erroneous belief that I held that all organisms are equally intelligent [as above], which contradicts your \"least conventionally intelligent\" designation IAC, showing that you knew that I held no such belief in the first place.\n \n \n\n I put 'intelligent' in quotes, and followed it with the words 'by your definition' to indicate that I was referring to your definition of intelligence.\n\n \n **\n Thing is, you appear to have not the least understanding of my definition of intelligence, even though it is as straightforward and plain as I can make it. Let me try and put it another way for you--\n Intelligence is the ability, capacity or power inherent in and intrinsic to, all living organisms, (i.e., autopoietic biosystems), by which they are able to learn, adapt, recall, choose, (select, discriminate, decide) and otherwise act in their own best interests, (as they perceive them), WRT the basic life goals--survive, thrive, and reproduce. This ability, capacity, and power varies widely, from individual to individual, and to a greater degree, from taxon to taxon. \n I hope you parse this definition accurately, as I do not see how I can possibly be more plainspoken. Compare this definition to the first and you will see that they are essentially the same.\n \n \n\n I later said 'the least conventionally intelligent', using the word 'conventionally' to refer to the conventional definition of intelligence.\n\n \n **\n Again, the Merriam-Webster IS the conventional definition, and it matches my own perfectly. Where's your problem?\n \n \n\n Shorn of these bewildering literary contortions, the statement runs thus:\n \n Moreover, analysis of the biosphere reveals the most adaptable creatures, and hence by your revised definition the most intelligent, to be almost without exception the least conventionally, consciously intelligent, with the simplest, least meta-structured forms, and the highest infant mortality rates. \n \n Is that better?\n\n \n **\n First, my definition is not a \"revised\" definition. Secondly, it was you, not I, that made \"intelligence\" a synomym of \"adaptibility\". I've questioned your definition (or distortion of my definition) from the start, since it never covered every aspect of or degree of intelligence, but only the basic level.\n The fact is that \"the simplest, least meta-structured forms\", such as bacteria, are the simplest to reconfigure adaptively, and thus require the least amount of intelligence to do so. Defined your way, (intelligence= adaptability), there is an obvious contradiction in terms--bacteria, being highly gifted with 'adaptability', which by you equals intelligence, must be the most intelligent, rather than the least intelligent, of lifeforms. And its true that if survive, thrive, and reproduce were the only marks of intelligence, then bacteria would be the geniuses of the biosphere. But the fact is that not only does vitality invigorate life and its intelligence in organisms, its use use in adapting/problem solving stimulates greater ability, and thus greater neurologic (systematic) complexity, hence greater difficulty in physical self-adaptation, hence a higher degree of intelligence, and so on and so on. Humans are now so neurologically complex that it is almost impossible for us to adapt ourselves morphologically, so instead of physically changing ourselves, we use our intelligence to physically change our environments, or to change our ideas and beliefs, in order to adapt to perceived problems relating to our survival, prosperity, and reproduction.\n \n But at least you've clarified for me that the confusion in your statement originated in your conflation of intelligence, at every level, with physical self-modification, i.e., your concept of \"adaptability\". And I can see where my definition of basic level intelligence might lead you to make that incorrect assumption. This is a complex issue, and it's easy to become confused, and confusing. I'm not sure that the confusion re 'intelligence' is resolved, so maybe we need to work on sorting that one out together?\n \n And I'm still confused by your \"highest infant mortality rates\"?!? Surely this does not apply to bacteria?\n \n \n\n No, I'm not. I'm simply questioning how a bacteria is supposed to know whether to act in its own best interests or those of the colony.\n\n \n **\n It doesn't. The good of the greater whole automatically supercedes the best interests of any part in a complex, autopoietic system. The whole, for bacteria, is the colony. For bees, the hive. For human cells, (except in the case of cancer), the entire human corpus. The whole, in nature, is not only greater than any one of its parts--it is greater than the sum of all of its parts.\n The common good of the whole always takes precedence over the personal good of any individual cell in any organismic entity, including bacteria colonies.\n \n \n\n And please don't - forgive me - blather on about the semantics of 'know', or different kinds of intelligence; for a bacteria (even one infused with vitality) to act in response to its environment there must be, encoded somewhere in some form, a recogniser for that stimulus, what the response should be, and a mechanism for introducing it to the genome. Anything else is - as you put it - acausal and magical.\n\n \n **\n You are absolutely right. And I say that that, \"recogniser\", as you put it, is \"intelligence\". What do you call your version of that \"recogniser\". What is it and how does it operate? How does it differ from good old fashioned 'intelligence'?\n \n \n\n Given the infinity of possible environmental stimuli - on an individual or group level, in chemical, physical or electromagnetic form - to which a bacteria might need to respond in the Lamarckian system, where are the recognisers?\n\n \n **\n I call your \"recognisers\" intelligence. Whether there is one infused intelligence throughout any many celled organism, like human being or a eusocial bacteria colony, or if it takes two forms, cellular intelligence and collective (i.e.,wholistic intelligence), as expressed by eusocial communities and eukaryotic organisms, (like us), I have yet to figure out to my own satisfaction. Just as I have not figured out just how it is that we replenish our store of Vitality by consuming dead lifeforms. That's a real puzzler for me. Vitality is life's energy, but what does 'energy' really consist of?!? Well, excuse me for, as you so graciously put it, \"blather[ing] on\".\n \n \n\n Where are the responses encoded? Why have we never seen them in action?\n \n\n \n **\n What?!?! You've never seen brainless organisms like bacteria colonies respond to external environmental stimuli? These responses are real. Just because you can't spot a 'brain' or other material 'organ' to which you can ascribe control, that is, a 'thing' that generates behaviour in the mechanist sense, that doesn't override the fact that these 'intelligent' responses are empirically real, and not just mindless chemical reactions. Look up bacterial colony responses to contact with antibacterial agents, if you don't believe me. And yet they don't have a brain in a cartload!\n \n \n\n What I am proposing is that you are, in this case, mistaking a mechanical method of arriving at success (RM+NS) for an intelligent one.\n\n \n **\n I would never mistake RM+_NS for anything other than what I believe it to be--a non-empirical, metaphysical, suppositional replacement for empirical, testable science.\n \n \n\n Who mentioned polar bears? Who mentioned any higher-order, conventionally intelligent creatures? I talked about plants, fungi and bacteria, to which you are bent on attributing intelligence and intent.\n\n \n **\n So you grant intelligence and volition to some organisms [animals with brains], but not to others [plants, yeasts, fungi, bacteria, etc.]. Why this arbitrary division, unless you hold to a notion that intelligence is purely, simply, and only, an epiphenomenon produced mechanically by a physical, material, entity called a brain? And a brain, I suppose, is just an epiphenomenon produced by a collection DNAcid molecules?\n \n Aside from a materialist presumption that all things proceed from the 'bottom-up', that is, from quarks to atoms to molecules to living cells to human brains, what do you have to justify your assumption that the 'brainless' have no intelligence? Especially if you insist that intelligence, as above, equals adaptability pure and simple? Even if, as in my definition, adaptability is 'lowest common denominator' of intelligence, if brainless creatures can adapt to their environment, then they must have intelligence.\n Unless, as a materialist/mechanist, you insist that adaptation is mechanical, that is, merely a coincidental bit of blind luck, derived from the spontaneous generation of a genetic novelty [mutation] that arose out of genomic entropy and decay. Do you? Of course you do. That's RM+NS in a nutshell. Where it belongs!! ;)\n \n I'm not \"bent on attributing intelligence and intent [volition]\" to plants and prokaryotes, I insist upon recognition of the fact that is case, and that that is evident upon empirical observation of their behaviours and responses to environmental stimuli; such as sensory input, pests, symbiosis, various toxins and novel nutrients.\n \n Plants, for instance, respond to their environments. There are some people who even claim that plants respond to love, and they often have truly magnificent plants to prove it. But let's leave that aside for the moment.\n \n \n\n That's absurd.\n\n \n **\n What's \"absurd\"? My statement,-- \"Yes. Their programmer's. Like all artefacts, they are ultimately the product of some organism's vitality, expressed as intelligent behaviour.\"?!? What in heaven's name can you find that is \"absurd\" about that assertion? Please elucidate.\n \n \n\n For a start, the programmer creates the environment, he does not program the organism.\n\n \n **\n By \"organism\" I'll assume you mean, 'computer simulation', or 'kritter'. If the programmer does not programme these sims, than who does? Or are you trying to say that they just 'spontaneously generate' themselves out of nothingness and nowhere, magicly? Talk about \"absurd\"!!\n \n \n\n Certain random configurations within that environment turn out to be self-replicating, simply according to the mechanical rules of that environment.\n\n \n **\n As devised and implemented by the programmer.\n \n \n\n At the very least, there's a significant discontinuity of vitality.

It is analogous to the laws of physics. Claiming that simulated organisms do not evolve or adapt is quite false\n\n \n **\n I have never said the \"Sim's Sims\", or anybody else's, do not change or evolve. They do. But only according to the rules and stimuli input into the programme by their programmer/creator/designer. This 'intelligent input/direction' not at all \"analogous to the laws of physics\". That's absurd.\n \n \n \n\n - and we do not need to impose an external purpose for this to occur.\n\n \n **\n That's absurd. None of this would ever happen if a programmer had no purpose in devising the programme.\n \n \n\n For example, these days we use genetic algorithms to design all sorts of things, like microchips. In such cases you are right: we intelligently impose our own criteria for success, filter accordingly, and mutate. What you can't seem to grasp is that reproduction generates its own success criteria, without any intelligent input.\n\n \n **\n I \"don't grasp\" it because you don't prove it, you simply assert it. Prove to us all that \"reproduction generates its own success criteria, without any intelligent input\". Sounds vacuous to the point of fatuous, to me, but prove me wrong, why don't you?\n \n \n\n You don't need any intelligence asking \"Can this reproduce? Yes, ok, make more like that; no, ok, put it in the bin\" because the things make more of themselves.\n\n \n **\n Say what?!?\n \n \n\n Nor do you need anyone to start the process off; you just need a self-replicating molecule to arise by chance, and POW, off you go!\n\n \n **\n So we're back to acausal 'spontaneous generation', 'creatio ex nihilo', are we? Why don't you just say, \"All we need is a stroke of magic, and away we go!\"?\n \n BTW, just what is a \"self-replicating\" molecule? I know that under certain initial conditions certain atoms, being present, form themselves into one or more identical molecules, but I've never heard of a molecule that, like bacteria colonies and banana trees, is able to 'self-replicate' itself.\n \n Well, I think I'm caught up to you now, so, back to you when your ready. :)",

   "What \"fiddling\" are you refering to, precisely?!? I've already taken pains to show that my definition and Merriam-Webster's match up. Apparently the only definition you have for 'intelligence' is that it equals 'adaptability'\n\n No; what I said was that you were extending the notion of intelligence to cover behaviour that would be better termed 'adaptability', such as the evolution of bacteria to thrive in new environments. The only reason you see intelligence where I see adaptability is that you believe their evolution to be - without exception - an internally directed, non-mechanical response to the environment.\n \n Setting aside the obvious, that I disagree with that belief, I think it's a poor choice of word even for your purposes, because it inevitably causes exactly this kind of confusion, leading to you having to make page after page of long-suffering clarification that you are not talking about 'human-like' intelligence.\n \nOf course humans are more intelligent than monkeys, and monkeys more intelligent than an e.coli. colonies. I simply cannot imagine from where you got your erroneous impression of my position on this\n\n As I explained, from your extension of the definition to cover what anyone not a 'vitalist' perceives as mechanical adaptation. Bacteria are by far the most biologically adaptable creatures on earth, making them, according to you, among the most intelligent. I would submit that at the very least you do your philosophy a disservice by throwing up such an obstacle to other people's comprehension of it.\n \nThe fact is that \"the simplest, least meta-structured forms\", such as bacteria, are the simplest to reconfigure adaptively, and thus require the least amount of intelligence to do so.\n \n This new wrinkle is not implicit in the definition you gave; I'm sorry if I failed to follow your reasoning correctly.\n \nDefined your way, (intelligence= adaptability),\n\n Now that I've cleared that misconception up, I'll skip over the related debate.\n \nAnd I'm still confused by your \"highest infant mortality rates\"?!? Surely this does not apply to bacteria?\n\n Generalising 'infant' to the bacterial sense of 'dying without producing offspring', absolutely - or in around a week one bacterium would spawn a colony the size of the earth.\n \nIt doesn't. The good of the greater whole automatically supercedes the best interests of any part in a complex, autopoietic system.\n\n 'Automatically'? Guns and cars can be automatic; there's still a mechanism to accomplish gear changes and chambering the next round.\n \n Not that I'm denying that cells do act for the greater good in an organism, mind you. But RM+NS covers that perfectly adequately by tending to eliminate non-cooperative 'colonies'. Your hypothesis requires the bacteria to know in advance what's best for the colony, which is a whole other ball game.\n \n \nYou are absolutely right. And I say that that, \"recogniser\", as you put it, is \"intelligence\". What do you call your version of that \"recogniser\". What is it and how does it operate? How does it differ from good old fashioned 'intelligence'?\n\n \n I'm not sure what you're asking. If by 'your version' you mean my personal recogniser, well, that's my brain.\n \n If you're asking what RM+NS's 'recogniser' is, that's even easier: it doesn't have or need one. Random mutations that happen to confer a statistical breeding advantage will tend to proliferate. Those that do the opposite will abate. Can you deny the logic of that?\n \n Saying that your 'recogniser' is 'intelligence' fails to explain anything. Ask me how I recognise things and I can point (with some practical difficulty, admittedly) to a chunk of neural tissue. If I ask you which bit of a bacterium recognises nylon and decides to mutate one of its genes to process it, where do you point? There's nothing physical there capable of accomplishing such a feat, so the whole process, from detecting a new material, understanding it to be a potential food source, knowing just which bit of which gene to change to metabolise it, and changing the gene, occurs in the metaphysical realm. \n \n Hmmm.\n \n \nWhat?!?! You've never seen brainless organisms like bacteria colonies respond to external environmental stimuli? These responses are real.\n\n \n I've seen my car go forward when I put my foot on the pedal, too. I've seen water splash when I throw a rock in. I've seen all kinds of mindless, mechanical reactions of all kinds of complexity, and I don't confuse them with intelligence.\n \n \nI would never mistake RM+_NS for anything other than what I believe it to be--a non-empirical, metaphysical, suppositional replacement for empirical, testable science.\n\n \n In the post of mine to which you have not replied (yes, I really was one post ahead), I pointed out exactly how RM+NS can and has been tested, and Lamarckism debunked: the chronology of evolution. Lamarckism requires, absolutely, that mutation occur after a new environment is encountered. That is not what we observe. Instead we find mutations - usually benefit-neutral in the current environment, but accidentally adaptive to the new environment - already present in the gene pool before the change in environment occurs.\n \n As I also went to some pains to explain in my other post, I am not endowing RM+NS with precognition. Mutations simply happen all the time; any given population will be chock full of variant alelles. Sometimes the environment changes and - hey look, one of those variants happens to confer an advantage.\n \n \nSo you grant intelligence and volition to some organisms [animals with brains], but not to others [plants, yeasts, fungi, bacteria, etc.]. Why this arbitrary division, unless you hold to a notion that intelligence is purely, simply, and only, an epiphenomenon produced mechanically by a physical, material, entity called a brain?\n\n \n I think that it is useful to retain a definition of intelligence with an identifiable scope. For instance, one (presently useful) metric of intelligence is orders of intentionality. We would struggle to apply such a metric to your yeast-based intelligence and arrive at any sensible conclusions. Whatever it is yeast does, I don't believe it has earned the right to be called 'intelligent'.\n \n \nUnless, as a materialist/mechanist, you insist that adaptation is mechanical, that is, merely a coincidental bit of blind luck, derived from the spontaneous generation of a genetic novelty [mutation] that arose out of genomic entropy and decay. Do you? Of course you do. That's RM+NS in a nutshell. Where it belongs!! ;)\n\n One might equally say that you, as a vitalist/mystic, baselessly insist in the face of all evidence to the contrary that adaptation cannot proceed mechanically.\n \nI'm not \"bent on attributing intelligence and intent [volition]\" to plants and prokaryotes, I insist upon recognition of the fact that is case, and that that is evident upon empirical observation of their behaviours and responses to environmental stimuli; such as sensory input, pests, symbiosis, various toxins and novel nutrients.\n\n You may insist, but the evidence does not back you up.\n \nPlants, for instance, respond to their environments. There are some people who even claim that plants respond to love, and they often have truly magnificent plants to prove it.\n\n Mechanisms respond to their environments too. I had a cyber-pet that died because I didn't pay it enough attention. So what?\n \nWhat's \"absurd\"? My statement,-- \"Yes. Their programmer's.\n\n Yep, that's the absurd part. Not because you're wrong about artifacts being the product of intelligence, but because you're asking me to accept that your 'vitality' can permeate a virtual world.\n \nBy \"organism\" I'll assume you mean, 'computer simulation', or 'kritter'. If the programmer does not programme these sims, than who does? Or are you trying to say that they just 'spontaneously generate' themselves out of nothingness and nowhere, magicly? Talk about \"absurd\"!!\n\n I'm going to take a wild punt at the idea you're not a programmer. Fortunately I happen to have been one for twenty two years, which greatly increases our collective chances of knowing what we're talking about in this area :)\n \n \"The Sims\" is not the kind of simulation under discussion. The Sims is designed to produce recognisable human-like behaviour, and all the aspects and responses of the 'sim people' are human designed and encoded.\n \n What used to be called 'life' simulations are quite different. The programmer creates a rudimentary virtual environment - typically a field of numbers - and adds some simple rules about how numbers should change depending on neighbouring values, analogous, as I said, to the laws of physics. No goals are defined. The environment is then filled with random numbers and the simulation started up.\n \n Sometimes nothing much happens. Other times self-replicating patterns blossom. Sometimes distinct, mobile, incomprehensibly primitive 'organisms' oscillate their way across the screen, until they encounter a pattern that 'kills' them.\n \n They don't come from 'nothing and nowhere'. They come from simple rules and random configurations of 'matter'.\n \n \nI \"don't grasp\" it because you don't prove it, you simply assert it. Prove to us all that \"reproduction generates its own success criteria, without any intelligent input\". Sounds vacuous to the point of fatuous, to me, but prove me wrong, why don't you?\n\n \n That will have to be tomorrow, as it's 2:41 and I ought to be in bed.",

   "I've been watching this debate closely, and as brief as my interjection is, I'd like a response nonetheless:\n \n \nSo you grant intelligence and volition to some organisms [animals with brains], but not to others [plants, yeasts, fungi, bacteria, etc.].

   "No; what I said was that you were extending the notion of intelligence to cover behaviour that would be better termed 'adaptability', such as the evolution of bacteria to thrive in new environments.\n\n \n **\n How is \"adaptability\" not a part of intelligent behaviour in any complex system? Do you think that adaptation is a matter of blind luck, of fortuitous accident? Perhaps you do, since you think that organismic adaptation to altered environments is a matter of RM+NS.\n \n Of course, attributing the 'ability to adapt', i.e., 'adapability', to blind and feckless luck, the fickle finger of fate, or whatever, is somewhat unscientific, don't you think?\n \n As a materialist/mechanist, if you wish to be 'scientific', then you need to find a physical, mechanical description for a regular, repeatable, predictable organismic, biochemical process, 'ability to adapt', (that is 'adaptibility'). \n I suspect that you do not have one of those. Oh, and please do not try to transform that near infinite number of possible environmental challenges to the organism, (as \"Natural Selection\"), the challenges to which it must adapt, i.e., possess adaptibility, into the very 'mechanism' that would account, in mechanist terms, for that very 'adaptability' itself!!!\n I know that a lot of Darwinist do try to pretend that the random changing of environmental circumstances, as \"NS\", somehow acts as a mechanical regularity. Please do not try that on me. \n \n If you can show that \"the evolution of bacteria to thrive in new environments\" is a physically mechanical process, and NOT one founded on either the random, coincidental good luck of a spontaneous genetic change coupled to a happy coincidence, NOR the internally, intelligently, heuristically derived solution to the immediate environmental stimulus, good or bad, of a novel environment, then please explain it to me. \n \n \n\n The only reason you see intelligence where I see adaptability is that you believe their evolution to be - without exception - an internally directed, non-mechanical response to the environment.\n\n \n **\n Actually I see adaptability as a part of intelligence, but not all of it. I thought I'd already made that clear.\n If bacteria were still the only lifeform on earth, then 'adaptability' might be nearly equivalent to 'intelligence'. But there is now a lot more to the biosphere than bacteria.\n And the only reason you wish to deny 'intelligence' and use 'adaptability' in its stead, is because you believe that 'adaptibility' is amenable to a mechanical view of biology, whereas 'intelligence' suggests a phenomenon that, being non-corporeal, not a case of 'matter in motion', cannot be allowed to exist in your materialist world, except, through a circumlocution, as the \"epiphenomenon\" of a mechanical brain.\n \n \n\n Setting aside the obvious, that I disagree with that belief, I think it's a poor choice of word even for your purposes, because it inevitably causes exactly this kind of confusion, leading to you having to make page after page of long-suffering clarification that you are not talking about 'human-like' intelligence.\n\n \n **\n Yes, that is unfortunate, and irritating. Unfortunately, I have yet to find a way around the difficulty. I've considered 'psyche' in place of intelligence, but I don't know if that would overcome the anthropocentric resistance people have to the basic notion that all life forms, including human beings, share exactly the same basic 'life traits'. That is, are only separated mentally by advanced and differing kinds and degrees of psychical abilities. People are beginning to accept that bonobos and porpoises are intelligent, but at this rate it will be a long time before they accept that trees and bacteria are too, only not so much.What's your reaction to 'psyche'? It's defined as, \"The immaterial part of a person; the actuating cause of an individual life.\" As such it would be the 'actuating cause' of both 'intelligence' and 'adaptability'. Nothing material or mechanical about it though, so just try to look at the word from my POV, if you would.\n \n \n\n As I explained, from your extension of the definition to cover what anyone not a 'vitalist' perceives as mechanical adaptation. Bacteria are by far the most biologically adaptable creatures on earth, making them, according to you, among the most intelligent. I would submit that at the very least you do your philosophy a disservice by throwing up such an obstacle to other people's comprehension of it.\n\n \n **\n Sigh. I sometimes wonder if you actually read what I write. The assertion that 'adaptability' = 'intelligence' is yours, not mine. I have repeatedly protested that adaptibility is not all of intelligence. You aren't listening. One more attempt--let us say that intelligence is the ability to experience and be aware, to solve problems, make choices, and retain solutions and positive choices.\n \n \n\n Not that I'm denying that cells do act for the greater good in an organism, mind you. But RM+NS covers that perfectly adequately by tending to eliminate non-cooperative 'colonies'.\n\n \n **\n Sorry, don't follow you.\n \n \n \n\n Your hypothesis requires the bacteria to know in advance what's best for the colony, which is a whole other ball game.\n\n \n **\n It most certainbly does not!?! Where do you get these ideas? My hypothesis requires only that an environment robustly and chronically stimulate an organism enough that it immediately responds to that stimulus, by changing its behaviour internally or outwardly. This change in behaviour stimulates the affected parts to change, and then developmentally such changes are passed on by epigenetic inheritance and developmental enhancement, and finally these changes stimulate a genomic change to suit the new phenotypic reality. \n \n I've laid that out for you already in this thread, and more than once. My hypothesis is strictly immediate stimulus/response; environment-<organism-<offspring-<genotype. \n \n The only hypothesis requiring a far-seeing oracle is RM+NS, which has chemicals (bits of DNA) preparing and storing millions of inconsequential 'genes' against some mystically foreseen future situation where some of them will suddenly be just the ticket the lucky organism needs, at that time and in that place, to adapt to a randomly arising environmental alteration. \n \n \n\n I'm not sure what you're asking. If by 'your version' you mean my personal recogniser, well, that's my brain.\n\n \n **\n Just what I said you'd say. \n \n \n\n If you're asking what RM+NS's 'recogniser' is, that's even easier: it doesn't have or need one. Random mutations that happen to confer a statistical breeding advantage will tend to proliferate. Those that do the opposite will abate. Can you deny the logic of that?\n\n \n **\n What logic? All you're saying is that \"whatever happens, happens, that's all\". What does logic have to do with something that meaningless? It's no more meaningful than saying that if a person holds the loto ticket whose number gets drawn, s/he wins. If not, s/he loses. Well, duh!?! \n \n \n\n Ask me how I recognise things and I can point (with some practical difficulty, admittedly) to a chunk of neural tissue.\n\n \n **\n Somehow I doubt that if you selected a piece of neural tissue, had it cut out and kept alive in a vat, that it would be able to 'recognise' either one particular thing, or anything at all.\n \n \n\n If I ask you which bit of a bacterium recognises nylon and decides to mutate one of its genes to process it, where do you point?\n\n \n \n **\n First at the cell walls of all the bacteria forming the outer perimeter of the colony, then at the remainder of all cells in the colony.\n \n \n\n There's nothing physical there capable of accomplishing such a feat, so the whole process, from detecting a new material, understanding it to be a potential food source, knowing just which bit of which gene to change to metabolise it, and changing the gene, occurs in the metaphysical realm. \n\n \n **\n No, it does not. Look up 'quorum sensing' in eusocial bacteria. I'll try to find some links for you on how bacterial colonies operate, but not until I catch up with my outstanding correspondence.\n \n \n\n I've seen my car go forward when I put my foot on the pedal, too. I've seen water splash when I throw a rock in. I've seen all kinds of mindless, mechanical reactions of all kinds of complexity, and I don't confuse them with intelligence.\n\n \n **\n Once again, I don't follow you.\n \n \n \n\n In the post of mine to which you have not replied (yes, I really was one post ahead),\n\n \n **\n Apparently you were two posts ahead. Could you find and cut 'n paste any portions of that overlooked post that have not yet been discussed? \n \n \n\n I pointed out exactly how RM+NS can and has been tested, and Lamarckism debunked:\n\n \n **\n Wow!! I can hardly wait to see how you did that!\n \n \n\n the chronology of evolution. Lamarckism requires, absolutely, that mutation occur after a new environment is encountered. \n\n \n **\n Absolutely untrue. Where in the world do you get such strange ideas?!?\n \n \n\n That is not what we observe. Instead we find mutations - usually benefit-neutral in the current environment, but accidentally adaptive to the new environment - already present in the gene pool before the change in environment occurs.\n\n \n **\n Quite the claim. Got any hard evidence for it that you can provide as links? And, excuse me, but if a gene is \"already present in the gene pool\", then in what sense is it a \"mutation\" instead of simply another inherited 'variation'?\n \n \n\n As I also went to some pains to explain in my other post, I am not endowing RM+NS with precognition. Mutations simply happen all the time; any given population will be chock full of variant alelles.\n\n \n **\n Yes, mutations do happen all the time. But the statement that some or any of these spontaneously generated entropic mutations are, (albeit coincidentally), adaptive, OR, that any _adaptive_ mutation is accidentally and coincidentally generated, is a metaphysical statement. And those are the statements that RM+NS makes.\n \n \n\n Sometimes the environment changes and - hey look, one of those variants happens to confer an advantage.\n\n \n **\n Wow. What a lucky little variant!\n \n \n \n\n One might equally say that you, as a vitalist/mystic, baselessly insist in the face of all evidence to the contrary that adaptation cannot proceed mechanically.\n\n \n **\n I'll stop insisting once you show me, (with empirical, not hypothetical, examples), just how your 'mechanical adaptation' operates in live organisms.\n \n \n\n Mechanisms respond to their environments too. I had a cyber-pet that died because I didn't pay it enough attention. So what?\n\n \n **\n Wow. Now you believe that 'cyber-pets', whatever they are, are just alive and organic as real animal pets. They can even 'die'! I'm starting to worry about your hold on reality.\n \n \n\n Yep, that's the absurd part. Not because you're wrong about artifacts being the product of intelligence, but because you're asking me to accept that your 'vitality' can permeate a virtual world.\n\n \n **\n I did no such thing. I said that the behaviours of 'kritters' in AI simulations can be traced back to the vitality in their programmer. Please do not distort my words or put new ones in my mouth.\n \n \n\n I'm going to take a wild punt at the idea you're not a programmer. Fortunately I happen to have been one for twenty two years, which greatly increases our collective chances of knowing what we're talking about in this area :)\n\n \n **\n Depends on what it is that we're talking about.\n \n \n\n \"The Sims\" is not the kind of simulation under discussion. The Sims is designed to produce recognisable human-like behaviour, and all the aspects and responses of the 'sim people' are human designed and encoded.\n \n What used to be called 'life' simulations are quite different. The programmer creates a rudimentary virtual environment - typically a field of numbers - and adds some simple rules about how numbers should change depending on neighbouring values, analogous, as I said, to the laws of physics. No goals are defined. The environment is then filled with random numbers and the simulation started up.\n \n Sometimes nothing much happens. Other times self-replicating patterns blossom. Sometimes distinct, mobile, incomprehensibly primitive 'organisms' oscillate their way across the screen, until they encounter a pattern that 'kills' them.\n \n They don't come from 'nothing and nowhere'. They come from simple rules and random configurations of 'matter'.\n\n \n **\n Right. They come from something non-corporeal and insubstantial, something analogous to the 'laws' of physics, which themselves come from something non-corporeal and insubstantial, and are themselves non-corporeal and insubstantial. They do not come from 'matter', unless you believe that 'matter' can also be ethereal, non-corporeal and insubstantial, which would be absurd, except that you already believe that you can have a cyber-pet that can die of neglect.\n \n Off to bed.

   "Continuing where I left off:\n \nI \"don't grasp\" it because you don't prove it, you simply assert it. Prove to us all that \"reproduction generates its own success criteria, without any intelligent input\". Sounds vacuous to the point of fatuous, to me, but prove me wrong, why don't you?\n\n Sure! Although to be fair, it's isn't 'all' of us who are having trouble understanding this logic :)\n \n At this point it's worth reiterating that RM+NS (really, these days the Modern Synthesis, which incorporates several other factors now recognised as important) is the mechanism of evolution, not abiogenesis, the creation of life. I do not need to show how RM+NS can create life from non-life because that's not what it proposes to explain. Do you accept this?\n \n Our starting point, then, is already a functional, self-replicating organism - just as in evolutionary microchip design we start with a functional design. I want you to assume for the moment that this organism is not capable of deliberate, intelligent genetic self-modification. Given that, can it still evolve?\n \n Yes:\n \n Random mutation and selection in microchip design yields more efficient microchips, better at doing the job we want them to do. I hope you can therefore accept that random mutation, combined with selection, can lead to adaptation. If not, I would respectfully direct your protests to the websites of companies that make a living doing exactly that.\n \n Of course, in chip design there's an objective; an external success criterion defined by us. An automated benchmark system (human-designed) sorts a set of randomly variant designs, discards all but the best, and starts over with the winner and a whole set of slightly mutated versions of it. The mutations (though random) are of course also artificially introduced, because chip designs don't mutate by themselves.\n \n Gene sequences, on the other hand, do randomly mutate all by themselves, in a number of different manners. By itself, this process is entropic - which also mirrors chip design, where most variations are equivalent to or less efficient than the original. Thus far, I hope you would agree, we have not introduced a requirement for intelligence in the behaviour of genes.\n \n Without a selection process, of course, entropy would triumph, in both chip design and genetics. In chip design the selection criteria are harsh - usually only one variant is taken as the seed for the next generation - and intelligently imposed. What about in genetics?\n \n If we examine what we mean by 'select', it can be broken down into two parts: retention/elimination, and sorting. You obviously cannot 'select' unless you keep some things and discard others, and it cannot be called 'selection' unless there is some consistent criteria for distinguishing which are kept and which rejected - otherwise it's just a random cull.\n \n Recall that we are talking about mutations to the genome of functional, self-replicating organisms in a population. Given finite resources - which in the real world is always true - and assuming that each organism is capable of producing more than one offspring in its lifetime, it follows that not every breeding opportunity can be realised. This is a logical inevitability; we still have no requirement for intelligence. \n \n Thus reproduction in an environment of finite resources certainly performs one aspect of selection: keeping some and eliminating others. More offspring are created than can survive to reproduce. But is it just a random cull?\n \n Given that genetic mutation means there is variation amongst the population, it is inconceivably unlikely that all mutations would be neutral - that is, have no effect on the likelihood of successful breeding. That would be akin to all random variations of a microchip being exactly as fast or efficient as all others.\n \n Given also that genes are inheritable, and that some variants have a statistical impact on the rate of successful breeding, the logical deduction is that the proportion of organisms in each subsequent generation possessing advantageous variants will tend to increase, while the proportion of organisms possessing disadvantageous variants will tend to decrease. It's not as hard-edged as human selection of microchip designs (or dog-breeding, for that matter), but it is a consistent (if comparatively gentle) criterion for determining which strains are more likely to dominate and which are more likely to abate.\n \n Thus reproduction of variant organisms in an environment of limited resources fulfils the other requirement of selection: consistent criteria for retention and elimination. And at no point have we introduced intelligence.\n \n I understand why you might assume NS is a tautology, but it's not: it's a feedback loop. Stick a microphone near a loudspeaker and you get a similar effect - \"What's amplified, is amplified\". Does the fact that that description is, on the surface, a tautology, mean feedback doesn't occur?\n \n When an environmental change occurs, RM+NS just keeps on blindly working: the only thing that changes is which variants confer advantage or disadvantage. Again, this is logically inevitable and requires no intelligent intervention. The exception would be if environmental changes are so extreme that none of the variants (pre-existing, or randomly occurring after the change) are capable of survival, ending in extinction.\n \nSo we're back to acausal 'spontaneous generation', 'creatio ex nihilo', are we? Why don't you just say, \"All we need is a stroke of magic, and away we go!\"?\n\n This constant misapplication of 'something from nothing' is becoming slightly wearisome. You are blinded by your requirement for a qualitative change in matter in living organisms, and cannot seem to grasp the importance of configuration. Complex configurations of matter can arise by chance or by the blind activity of physical laws - snowflakes, for example.\n \nBTW, just what is a \"self-replicating\" molecule?\n\n RNA, for one. 'Self-replicating' here does not mean that the actual atoms subdivide, like bacteria, but that they form a pattern which, when it encounters certain other chemicals, binds them in a way that extends the pattern.\n \n A simple but useful analogy is the idea of stacking bowling balls. Once the first layer is in place, dropping more bowling balls randomly on top will tend to create a repeating, interlocking pattern. And a hell of a lot of noise.\n \n On to the next post:\n \nHow is \"adaptability\" not a part of intelligent behaviour in any complex system? Do you think that adaptation is a matter of blind luck, of fortuitous accident? Perhaps you do, since you think that organismic adaptation to altered environments is a matter of RM+NS.\n\n Of course intelligent systems can adapt, but intelligence is not required for adaptation. Not all adaptation is fortuitous accident, but genetic adaptation (actual mutation, not an evolved chemical repression/expression response statically encoded in the genome) is.\n \nOf course, attributing the 'ability to adapt', i.e., 'adapability', to blind and feckless luck, the fickle finger of fate, or whatever, is somewhat unscientific, don't you think?\n\n No, and I haven't the slightest idea why you think it is. Random mutations do occur. That is a scientific observation. Variations do have a statistical impact on breeding rates. That too is an observable phenomenon. The inevitable logical deduction is that accidentally beneficial mutations will tend to dominate, and this too is what we observe to occur. Sticking your head in the sand and denying it is the unscientific response.\n \nIf you can show that \"the evolution of bacteria to thrive in new environments\" is a physically mechanical process, and NOT one founded on either the random, coincidental good luck of a spontaneous genetic change coupled to a happy coincidence, NOR the internally, intelligently, heuristically derived solution to the immediate environmental stimulus, good or bad, of a novel environment, then please explain it to me.\n\n Since it is founded on accidentally adaptive genetic change, I'll do no such thing :)\n \nSigh. I sometimes wonder if you actually read what I write. The assertion that 'adaptability' = 'intelligence' is yours, not mine. I have repeatedly protested that adaptibility is not all of intelligence. You aren't listening.\n\n I have never once asserted that adaptability = intelligence, or that adaptability is 'all of intelligence'. You hastily misinterpreted my earlier posts on the subject and have repeated that error, ignoring several clear rebuttals. Go and check before making snide remarks.\n \n You wrote this:\n \nI hypothesize a natural force called, appropriately enough, \"Vitality\", and accord to autopoietic biosystems (live organisms) the power and capacity to harness that force to achieve their own personal objectives, such as , to survive, to thrive, and to reproduce. That power and capacity to harness Vitality I call individual, local, intelligence.\n\n and this:\n \nI think it more honest to simply define intelligence as a live organism's capacity or power to deal with the demands, both internal and external, that are made upon it by the world, WRT its ambition (usually unconscious), to survive, thrive, and (usually) to reproduce.\n\n To which I replied:\n \nwhy hijack 'intelligence' as the term to describe that capacity? 'Adaptability' serves perfectly well, without the attendant baggage of implied conscious intent.\n\n You then said:\n \nFirst you try to tell me that I should be saying \"adaptability\" when I say \"intelligence\",\n\n Implying that you knew I was saying that you were using an inappropriate word, not claiming that intelligence = adaptability.\n \n You invented that second opinion for me and have argued against it ever since; I'd appreciate it if you stopped, and addressed the point I actually made, which is that [/B]you were claiming that all biological adaptability requires intelligence.[/B] If this is not the case, and you accept that adaptability can occur in the absence of intelligence, then by all means I will drop the subject. Otherwise, my point stands: you are trying to redefine 'intelligence' so as to cover all biological adaptation.\n \n \nIt most certainbly does not!?! Where do you get these ideas? My hypothesis requires only that an environment robustly and chronically stimulate an organism enough that it immediately responds to that stimulus, by changing its behaviour internally or outwardly. This change in behaviour stimulates the affected parts to change, and then developmentally such changes are passed on by epigenetic inheritance and developmental enhancement, and finally these changes stimulate a genomic change to suit the new phenotypic reality.\n\n \n I get these ideas from the gaping holes in the explanation you proceed to give for how environmental stimuli lead to genetic change (I bolded some of them). To give an immediate and useful response to stimuli, the bacteria must know how to respond in advance - 'know' in the sense of a response being encoded somewhere. Anything else would require conscious, analytical, predictive thought: \"A new stimulus! Let's see, what would work...\". So which is it? Analytical, predictive thought, capable of imagining what would happen if a particular change was made, and choosing the appropriate course of action, or pre-encoded response?\n \n Your basic error is to take the fact that bacteria can be observed to respond in predetermined ways to certain stimuli, muddle it up with the observed effects of RM+NS, and announce that bacteria can respond intelligently to all stimuli. This is a mistake for at least three reasons:\n \n First, Lamarckism predicts that similar organisms faced with the same challenge should 'intelligently adapt' in similar ways - or at the very least should all be capable of adaptation. Except in the case of verifiably pre-existing, genetic encoding of responses to specific stimuli, this does not happen. As I pointed out with the case of the nylon-eating bacteria, mutative adaption was found in only one location, though countless billions of bacteria must starve to death every day worldwide with only nylon as a potential food source. That is what we would expect from a random mutation, not from intelligent self-modification.\n \n Second, it requires that adaptive behavioural change be possible. Yet a bacteria without the mutated gene physically cannot process nylon. It can't clench its pili and just try. Mutation must have come first.\n \n Third, it's unnecessary. Evolution via RM+NS is logically inescapable given observed facts such as random mutation, reproduction and finite resources. Postulating additional forces at work is like insisting that Father Christmas is real, or else how would presents arrive?\n \nSomehow I doubt that if you selected a piece of neural tissue, had it cut out and kept alive in a vat, that it would be able to 'recognise' either one particular thing, or anything at all.\n\n You are so wrong :) Neural networks can recognise patterns whether they are inside an organism or not. It's just a case of wiring them up to stimuli. Simulated neural networks can recognise faces and text, and work is in progress to create biological versions.\n \n Now, this next bit I find a little irritating. In response to this from me:\n \nthe chronology of evolution. Lamarckism requires, absolutely, that mutation occur after a new environment is encountered.\n\n you wrote:\n \nAbsolutely untrue. Where in the world do you get such strange ideas?!?\n\n I mean, please. Given the context of the sentence, both before and after, I was clearly saying that Lamarckism requires that adaptive mutation can only occur after the new environment is encountered. It would take a special effort to misread it as \"Lamarckism requires mutation to occur whenever a new environment is encountered.\"\n \nYes, mutations do happen all the time. But the statement that some or any of these spontaneously generated entropic mutations are, (albeit coincidentally), adaptive, OR, that any _adaptive_ mutation is accidentally and coincidentally generated, is a metaphysical statement. \n\n \n Is the statement 'A tossed coin will sometimes land heads up' also metaphysical? If so, is it false? \n \n I find your hypocrisy astounding; you disallow, seemingly as it suits you, perfectly reasonable deduction and conjecture on specious grounds, whilst advocating the existence of a universal fifth force capable of imbuing simple life with intelligence. Again, from the post you did not reply to, why don't your criticisms of 'emergence' apply to the 'emergence' of intelligence in the interaction between vitality and a bacterium - intelligence being a property neither possesses?\n \n A mutation will either be reproductively neutral, deletorious or advantageous. There are no other possibilities. Unless you can prove that they can neither be advantageous to the current environment, nor later turn out to be advantageous in some future environment, I see no reason to accept your criticism of the statement.\n \nWow. What a lucky little variant!\n\n There you go! Now you're getting the hang of things.\n \nWow. Now you believe that 'cyber-pets', whatever they are, are just alive and organic as real animal pets. They can even 'die'! I'm starting to worry about your hold on reality.\n\n Aren't you bored with making strawmen yet? I made a facaetious remark in response to your equally flippant hippie flower-power 'plants detect love' sally, yet I don't intend to persistently fling 'plant love' in your face to ridicule your Vitalism hypothesis. Why? Because I don't need to; I can refute it logically. Is questioning my grip on reality the best you can manage?\n \nI did no such thing. I said that the behaviours of 'kritters' in AI simulations can be traced back to the vitality in their programmer.\n\n Then you're merely wrong, not absurd - or at least, no additional absurdity has here been heaped upon an already remarkably absurd premise. I apologise.\n \nRight. They come from something non-corporeal and insubstantial, something analogous to the 'laws' of physics, which themselves come from something non-corporeal and insubstantial, and are themselves non-corporeal and insubstantial. They do not come from 'matter', unless you believe that 'matter' can also be ethereal, non-corporeal and insubstantial, which would be absurd, except that you already believe that you can have a cyber-pet that can die of neglect.\n\n Ignoring the insult, as we agreed to do earlier, let's see what you're saying.\n \n First, you criticise the rules that support the evolution of these creatures for being 'non-corporeal and insubstantial'. I guess that would be like gravity, then, or - what was that other one you explicitly described as non-corporeal? Ah yes: vitality. I guess we should probably just move on, shouldn't we?\n \n Secondly, you criticise the organisms for not being constructed from matter. Well, any computer simulation can be reproduced mechanically (proved by Turing). Configurations of electrons interacting according to simple rules become configurations of solid matter interacting according to analogous, real-world physical rules. In that case, the AI organisms would manifest as - hmm... configurations of solid matter! If we were to make that matter fine-grained enough, who knows what we might mistake them for ;)\n \n This is as good a time as any to explore one of vitalism's other inconsistencies. The Theory of Evolution does not express an opinon with regard to abiogenesis, but Vitalism does - and it is a problematic one: it's a contradiction to say both that vitality imparts a qualitative change, and that it is only possessed by complex living organisms.\n \n If vitality brings about a qualitative change necessary for life, how did the first complex, organised structure capable of harnessing it or being affected by it turn up? According to vitalism it cannot have been alive up to the point of attaining vitality, yet it must nevertheless have been capable of forming a more complex structure from a less complex one - unless the first organism sprang into existence fully formed. So, since it was already doing just fine on its own, why do we need vitality?\n \n On the other hand, if vitality brought about life by organising and acting upon non-organic matter, then it's not true to say that only organic life can harness vitality. We should also expect to see life arising from the inanimate all around us, yet we do not - and we should certainly not expect to see evidence for common descent (a single ancestor organism), evidence for which is in fact staggeringly, toweringly emphatic.",

Instead, they die and their offspring either happen to be inherently able to deal with the problem from birth, or their offspring also die.\n\n \n **\n Collin, this is just plain wrong. but if you accept RM+NS as gospel, it will difficult to dissuade you. Modern microbiology, especially over the past 20 years, has shown conclusively that eusocial bacteria colonies possess a collective mechanism akin to the eukaryotic immune system. Did you do the research on eusocial bacteria, quorum sensing, etc., that I suggested you do?\n Just google, you don't have to go to a university library or anything like that.\n \n \n\n 1. b) Bacteria cannot apply knowledge to manipulate their environment;\n\n \n **\n No, bacteria, so far as I know, are only able to apply 'knowledge' to manipulate their own physiologies, and only unconsciously. They are quite primitive life forms, with quite primitive mental mechanisms, after all. The next step up, to organisms that can manipulate their environments, would, I suppose be certain plants, among them the flowering plants that manipulate insects into their pollination agenda, and eusocial insects such as bees and termites and ants, that keep climate-controlled dwelling places, and then on to fish, and birds who build nests and bowers, mammals like beavers who construct dams and lodges.\n \n \n\n nor can they think abstractly.\n\n \n **\n No, they can't. That's apparently reserved to human beings, although some claim the ability for such diverse creatures as apes, cetaceans, and parrots, and they do seem to have supporting evidence.\n \n \n\n 2.) This is the only definition that's even in the ballpark, and it still leaves a tremendous gap between bacteria and organisms with brains.\n\n \n **\n I've never denied a wide variance in mental capabilities among live organisms. Of course the variance is greatest between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Isn't every trait at greatest variance between these two classifications, but aren't they both still perfectly qualified lifeforms? Do you deny that prokaryotes are alive, or that plants are alive, the way that you deny that they are intelligent. Just what is your understanding of 'life' itself, to distinguish a live organism from a stone or a spade, if it is not to stipulate that live organisms are are aware, self-aware, knowledgable, sensitive, discriminatory, pro-active,\n self-regulating, and dynamic? All of these characteristics, and others that don't come to mind at the moment, display the difference between the animate and the inanimate, they all require 'intelligence', and every living organism displays them. Try to find me a brainless plant or prokaryote that does not.\n \n \n\n Bacteria can only note changes in their environment and respond to them according to how their DNA dictates.\n\n \n **\n Wrong. No life form's behaviour, no matter what geneticists might tell you, is totally genetically pre-determined. It wasn't that long ago, and among many materialist geneticists it still persists, that they were telling us that all behaviour, including all human behaviour, was genetically pre-determined, and that our sense of self-control and volition, particularly 'free will', was entirely apparent, not real, simply an illusion. We were all just mechanical robots doing exactly what we were pre-programmed to do by the accidents of genetics, no matter what. People tend to scoff at that when applied to themselves, but happily stick with it when applied to brainless bacteria. But, well, that's people for you.\n \n \n\n Bacteria cannot note a change in their environment and chose among several different options.\n\n \n **\n They most certainly can, and do, (albeit unconsciously). Do the research. Do you really still believe that global bacterial resistance to antibiotics is all just a matter of luck?!? Or the magic of 'spontaneous generation' of just the right genetic mutation happening by pure accident, coincidental to the immediate needs of the bacteria involved!?! Come, on, people, let's get real here!\n \n \n \n\n If WascallyWabbit means to equate all intelligence under the term \"mental acuteness,\" so be it; organisms with brains simply have a vastly higher level of mental acuteness than other organisms, and that level is measurable. Notwithstanding, mental acuteness is not the conventional meaning of intelligence.\n\n \n **\n I've had this conversation with peeling, and I agree with you that the word 'intelligence' is overloaded with anthropocentric implications. I don't have a good replacement for it, unfortunately. What do you think of 'psyche', or 'mentality', for instance?",

I just don't have enough time.\n \n As it is, I'm only going to be able to make a start on this long post, and even then only address what iI consider to be your salient points.\n \n \n\n Continuing where I left off:\n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n \"I \"don't grasp\" it because you don't prove it, you simply assert it.

Although to be fair, it's isn't 'all' of us who are having trouble understanding this logic. \n\n \n Unnecessarily snide remark, don't you think? I don't like being patronized and condescended to, and besides, just how do you know that any of 'us', other than yourself, have no trouble following your self-styled 'logic'. Omniscient, are you?!? :)\n \n \n\n At this point it's worth reiterating that RM+NS (really, these days the Modern Synthesis, which incorporates several other factors now recognised as important) is the mechanism of evolution, not abiogenesis, the creation of life.\n\n \n **\n Actually it's neither the mechanism of \"abiogenesis\" nor that of \"evolution\". It's simply that some cling to the false belief that RM+NS is the mechanism of evolution for philosophical and religious reasons. The fact is, that abiogenesis, defined thus:-\n a\u00b7bi\u00b7o\u00b7gen\u00b7e\u00b7sis (b--jn-ss)\n n.\n The supposed development of living organisms from nonliving matter.

They are imaginative suppositions, and that is all they are.\n \n \n\n I do not need to show how RM+NS can create life from non-life because that's not what it proposes to explain. Do you accept this?\n\n \n **\n Just that much, yes. Although, rationally, any theory that claims to explain the evolution of original life forms, once life is present, really needs to be able to explain, at least hypothetically, the origin of lifeforms in the first place. Handwaving about this sticking point really cuts no ice. My hypothesis, Vitality, does account for both evolution and genesis. Your \"RM+NS\" simply cannot, since it is based upon a notion of creation by entropic accident.\n \n \n\n Our starting point, then, is already a functional, self-replicating organism - just as in evolutionary microchip design we start with a functional design. I want you to assume for the moment that this organism is not capable of deliberate, intelligent genetic self-modification. Given that, can it still evolve?\n\n \n **\n Short answer? No. Why not?

   " (peeling)Random mutation and selection in microchip design yields more efficient microchips, better at doing the job we want them to do. I hope you can therefore accept that random mutation, combined with selection, can lead to adaptation. If not, I would respectfully direct your protests to the websites of companies that make a living doing exactly that.\n\n \n \n **\n Your problem is that you fail to differentiate between intelligent 'selection' (the only real, true, and actual 'selection' there can be), and the false literary analogy of 'selection', i.e., \"Natural Selection\", a metaphysical postulate falsely decreed to be a mechanical regularity, a universal force, a a mystical agency paraded as if it were as regular and predictable and physically mechanical as the laws of physics and chemistry!! A superstition passed off as a scientific principle, for heaven's sake!!\n \n Of course delimited randomness and intelligent selection is a terrific mechanism for generatig original material. In human terms we used to call it 'brainstorming', 'spit-balling, 'trial and error learning' and 'heuristic problem solving' In the end, heuristic problem-solving is exactly what it is. And that is exactly what organisms use in order to deal with, adapt to, and to evolve in keeping with, their environments. It is all part and parcel of the post-darwinian neo-lamarckian approach to developmental evolution.\n \n \n\n Of course, in chip design there's an objective; an external success criterion defined by us.\n\n \n **\n Well, duh, yeah. As above.\n \n \n\n An automated benchmark system (human-designed) sorts a set of randomly variant designs, discards all but the best, and starts over with the winner and a whole set of slightly mutated versions of it. The mutations (though random) are of course also artificially introduced, because chip designs don't mutate by themselves.\n\n \n **\n Just as I have already pointed out. There is only a false, disingenous analogy to RM+NS. OTH, it is exactly how autopoietic biosystems originate fresh behavioural and morphological responses to the stimuli thrown at them by their environments. What is it is, is something I call, Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis, the post darwinian, post \"Modern Synthesis\", post RM+NS, neo-lamarckian, devo-evo mechanism driving evolution. EAM, for short.\n \n According to the EAM hypothesis, so long as environment remains stable, the members of an ecosytem do not evolve. But when an environment randomly alters, it incites a state of disequilibrium, that is, the members of the ecosystem are suddenly maladapted to the new reality. If the maladaptation is severs, it induces physical and behavioural responses in the organisms immediately affected. If they don't die, they change.\n Those that can alter their behaviour internally, organically, or outwardly. If they can go to another ecosystem similar to their old one, then all they do is change location, not themselves. But if they cannot change their surroundings to suit themselves, then they must change themselves to suit their new surroundings, that is, their altered environment.\n \n These are those that 'evolve'. At first their altered behaviours alter their physiogomy in somewhat minor ways. Starving dutch mothers in WWII grow skinny and have small, thin babies. Thanks to epigenetic inheritance, those babies, even though well fed after the war, have smaller, thinner babies (in the 60's) than was normal before the war, or in the third generation, when these well-fed babies have chubby babies of their own, in the 80's.\n \n In the case of bacteria, the eusocial colony senses the toxic stimulus of an antibiotic where 'the rubber meets the road', that is at the cell walls of the bacteria forming the colony's outer perimeter. Through quorum sensing and collective intelligence chemical signals communicate information from the cells immediately under attack to thos behind them, and so on, until all bacteria in the colony are alerted and put into a state of hyper-mutation that, just like the computer programme, creates a heuristic randomness, adaptively. Continuing feedback from 'the front' directs the mutations toward the immediate, particular problem, but, as bacteria are quite primitive, it is more a 'shotgun' response, in which many more kinds of mutation are generated than actually deal with the specified antibiotic. Still, it is directed well enough that most antibiotics are defeated by a specified response to them, and within a number of generations far too short to be merely the blind firing of stochastic mutation. This is EAM.\n \n Time for another break. Later.",

   "A superstition passed off as a scientific principle, for heaven's sake!!\n\n I certainly hope that you are not here to advocate ID as a scientific theory.\n \n I would also like to point out a few flaws in your reasoning, starting here:\n \n...intelligent 'selection' (the only real, true, and actual 'selection' there can be)\n\n Because I don't want to play word games, here is a definition of selection:\"To take as a choice from among several; pick out.\"This definition does not require \"intelligence,\" and even if it did, all you can show with that argument is that \"natural selection\" is poorly named.\n \n There are processes which can \"select\" one item rather than others. For example, consider a filter. Filters allow some things through and prevent others from passing. This is done without any form of intelligence (even intelligence as you define it). Rather, it is done based on size, chemical composition, polarity, etc.\n \n \n Similarly, natural selection is a process which selects traits of organisms based on the reproductive rates of the organisms in question.\n In short, traits which allow/cause an organism to reproduce more will begin to appear in a greater percent of the organism's population. Examples of such traits would be the absence of tusks in elephants, heat tolerance in bacteria, and pesticide resistance in rats.\n \n \n \n \n Here's another problem quote:\n \n...\"Natural Selection\", a metaphysical postulate falsely decreed to be a mechanical regularity, a universal force, a a mystical agency paraded as if it were as regular and predictable and physically mechanical as the laws of physics and chemistry!!\n\n 1) Natural selection is not as predictable as the various laws of physics and chemistry. However, the theory of evolution by natural selection does make predictions which can be tested and have been confirmed.\n 2) Natural selection is not \"a a mystical agency.\" It involves populations, organisms within the populations, and traits of the organisms. Given a set of circumstances, it can be used to predict what will happen to a population. However, when it is used this way, it could be easily mistaken for common sense (e.g. if poachers are killing elephants with the longest tusks, you might expect more tuskless elephants to be born).\n \n \n \n \n Because of the length of your post, I do not have time to respond to it in its entirety.\n \n I do want to know, though:\n What makes you think that a fifth \"force\" called vitality is required to explain organisms which can also be well explained by chemistry?",

   "**\n To continue--\n \n \n peeling--\n Gene sequences, on the other hand, do randomly mutate all by themselves, in a number of different manners. By itself, this process is entropic - which also mirrors chip design, where most variations are equivalent to or less efficient than the original. Thus far, I hope you would agree, we have not introduced a requirement for intelligence in the behaviour of genes.\n\n \n \n **\n I should hope not!! Genes are merely mindless 'bits of stuff', DNAcid, used to encode information. They are lifeless, and no more intelligent than the paper and ink used in the publishing industry. What you are getting confused about is that I claim that _live organisms_ are intelligent--not the material bits (molecules) they are constructed out of.\n \n \n\n Without a selection process, of course, entropy would triumph, in both chip design and genetics. In chip design the selection criteria are harsh - usually only one variant is taken as the seed for the next generation - and intelligently imposed.\n\n \n **\n But 'selection' is not 'selection' in the true and original sense of the word unless it is both intentional and intelligent. \"Natural Selection\" is a humbug. The only way it could exist in materialist fashion, as I've pointed out before, is if it could be observed to act with predictable regularity, always and everywhere. But 150 years of empirical observation show that there is no mechanical regularity in evolution that could be attributed to this supposed \"NS\". RM+NS =biological entropy.\n \n \n\n What about in genetics?\n \n If we examine what we mean by 'select', it can be broken down into two parts: retention/elimination, and sorting.\n\n \n **\n That's what you guys mean by 'select'. The rest of us like the old meaning, which involves intelligence and volition. Your (meaning you darwinists') Humpty Dumpty transmogrification of an excellent English word to suit the purposes of your ideology is more than bit off-putting.\n \n The only word equivalent to 'selection' in the materialist/mechanist sense is mechanical sorting. I've pointed this out before. The trouble with mechanical sorting is that it obeys the laws of physics in the regular, predictable, mechanical fashion that enables us to predict, for example, just how much sand, as opposed to gravel, will be laid down at a particular place in a particular streambed. This is not at all akin to what we see in nature where biological, evolutionary, \"selection\", is given your Humpty Dumpty definition. No offense, but that's a plain fact.\n \n I hope I don't have to be endlessly repeating this observation.\n \n \n\n You obviously cannot 'select' unless you keep some things and discard others, and it cannot be called 'selection' unless there is some consistent criteria for distinguishing which are kept and which rejected - otherwise it's just a random cull.\n\n \n **\n You do realize that you're showing up \"NS\" for the metaphysical mumbo-jumbo that it really is, don't you? I mean, just what is the constant, universal criteria in \"NS\" that turns out mechanically uniform results? That's a rhetorical question, of course:).\n \n \n\n Given that genetic mutation means there is variation amongst the population, it is inconceivably unlikely that all mutations would be neutral - that is, have no effect on the likelihood of successful breeding. That would be akin to all random variations of a microchip being exactly as fast or efficient as all others.\n\n \n **\n Unfortunately for this hypothesis, actual empirical research in the field demonstrates conclusively that under stable environmental condition, i.e., non-catastrophic environmental conditions, that, except for birth defects and unfortunate accidents, most adapted organisms of any given taxon are so phenotypically similar that their minor differences make no difference to survival and reproduction rates, and that there is next to no evolution in any vital (non-trivial) sense.\n \n If you want to talk catastrophic circumstances, catastrophes and their survival are simply a matter of blind luck, unless and until survival is accomplished by measures taken by potential victims. EAM is about measures taken, inteligently and deliberately, by certain organisms in order to survive under challenging circumstance. Unlike what can be inferred from RM+NS, evolution is not just a matter of blind luck or magic. It takes work.\n \n \n\n Given also that genes are inheritable, and that some variants have a statistical impact on the rate of successful breeding,\n\n \n **\n Do they? Not in stable environments they don't. General catastrophes? Can you link to examples? The 'peppered moths' won't cut it, since there is no hard evidence there. The only other warhorse darwinists regularly trot out is the Grants' study of Galapagos finches under drought conditions. I'm an old hand at ripping that one to shreds AFA RM+NS is concerned, but feel free to try it on again.\n \n \n\n the logical deduction is that the proportion of organisms in each subsequent generation possessing advantageous variants will tend to increase, while the proportion of organisms possessing disadvantageous variants will tend to decrease.\n\n \n **\n Only if we accept the truth of your premise number one. I don't, as above.\n \n \n \n\n It's not as hard-edged as human selection of microchip designs (or dog-breeding, for that matter), but it is a consistent (if comparatively gentle) criterion for determining which strains are more likely to dominate and which are more likely to abate.\n\n \n **\n The truth is, not only is \"NS\" not \"hard-edged\", it has no edges at all. It's as amorphous and nebulous as a foggy night. The criterion are seldom similar, let alone identical, never consistent, and every instance is anomalous and relative to local circumstance, both in subject and 'selecting' agent.\n \n \n\n Thus reproduction of variant organisms in an environment of limited resources fulfils the other requirement of selection: consistent criteria for retention and elimination. And at no point have we introduced intelligence.\n\n \n **\n No. Instead you've introduced a false, and entirely irrational, postulate--that \"NS\" is as determined, mechanical, regular and predictable as the movement of a rock in a streambed. There's no intelligence there, either, but there is something amenable to empirical science, thanks to the laws of physics. That being, the universality of gravity and the consistency of aquaeous carrying cpacity, and so forth. There's no such a thing in \"NS\".\n \n \n\n I understand why you might assume NS is a tautology, but it's not: it's a feedback loop.\n\n \n **\n Actually, I think that \"NS\" is such meaningless verbiage that it doesn't qualify as a tautology. \"Survival of the fittest\", qualifies, however.\n \n \n\n When an environmental change occurs, RM+NS just keeps on blindly working: the only thing that changes is which variants confer advantage or disadvantage. Again, this is logically inevitable and requires no intelligent intervention. \n\n \n **\n This is pure metaphysical speculation, without an ounce of empirical evidence to back it up. Yes, things change, and organisms evolve. That's a given. It is not evidence that it happens thanks to RM+NS.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n \"So we're back to acausal 'spontaneous generation', 'creatio ex nihilo', are we? Why don't you just say, \"All we need is a stroke of magic, and away we go!\"?\" \n \n This constant misapplication of 'something from nothing' is becoming slightly wearisome. \n\n \n **\n There is no \"misapplication\" here, despite your irritation. My response , above, was to your own, \n \"Nor do you need anyone to start the process off; you just need a self-replicating molecule to arise by chance, and POW, off you go! \" \n My response to that was spot on pertinent.\n \n Time's up for now.

'Self-replicating' here does not mean that the actual atoms subdivide, like bacteria, but that they form a pattern which, when it encounters certain other chemicals, binds them in a way that extends the pattern.\n\n \n **\n Which means that in the standard English sense of the word that they do not 'self-replicate'. That no molecule does anything. That some molecules tend to \"grow\", in the manner of crystals, I suppose. That is, that given the proper initial conditions (chemical components), multitudes will be generated by normal chemical reactions. To call this \"self-replicating\" is another case of literary personification, (as in crystal \"growth\" or natural \"selection\"), which should not be taken as literal fact, but often is presented as such by those whose philosophy makes no distinction between live persons/organisms and bits of inanimate stuff, like molecules.\n And it would seem to me that if it takes Humpty Dumpty semantics to make a point, then the point is probably false.\n \n \n\n On to the next post:\n \n Quote:\n How is \"adaptability\" not a part of intelligent behaviour in any complex system? Do you think that adaptation is a matter of blind luck, of fortuitous accident? Perhaps you do, since you think that organismic adaptation to altered environments is a matter of RM+NS. \n \n Of course intelligent systems can adapt, but intelligence is not required for adaptation. Not all adaptation is fortuitous accident, but genetic adaptation (actual mutation, not an evolved chemical repression/expression response statically encoded in the genome) is.\n\n \n **\n What in the world do you mean by \"genetic adaptation\"--accidental entropic genetic mutation? How is that an \"adaptation\" to an environment? In that sense, smashing a coconut on a rock would be a case of a coconut \"adapting\" to a \"rocky environment\". So would slipping and falling off a cliff be \"adapting to a gravitational environment\". Absurd. Let's not play fast and loose withat stout English word, \"adaptation\". Let's not try to pretend that inanimate DNAcid molecules are capable of anything so dynamic as \"adaptation\"--they are merely passive bits of stuff that can be arranged or ordered _by_ something else, but they have no ability to 'adapt' themselves _to_ anything else. Only live, intelligent organisms can do that.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Of course, attributing the 'ability to adapt', i.e., 'adapability', to blind and feckless luck, the fickle finger of fate, or whatever, is somewhat unscientific, don't you think? \n \n No, and I haven't the slightest idea why you think it is.\n\n \n **\n Because luck, being essentially a hypothetical 'cause' for inexplicable, non-empirical, irregular, unpredictable, acausal outcomes, is a superstition, (like 'magic', white or black), and superstion and its magic have no place in science.\n \n \n\n Random mutations do occur. That is a scientific observation.\n\n \n **\n Yes, they do. You have earlier agreed that such mutations are strictly entropic. Just how entropic behaviour can increase the efficiency of of an operating system, or in any way lead to an increase in its productivity or complexity, you have yet to explain. I maintain that accidental mutations are nothing but throwing a sabot into the looms, i.e., an act of sabotage that yiels anything from total system failure (severe genetic birth defect) to an inconsequential hiccup (neutrality), but never ever produces a loom that makes cloth faster and better. It takes an intelligent human to build a better loom, and it takes an intelligent organism to build a better genome. Better for itself, that is.\n \n \n\n Variations do have a statistical impact on breeding rates.\n\n \n **\n Only where variations have been intelligently selected against the criterion, \"fecundity\". Otherwise \"luck\" is just as useful as \"selection\" as a causal explanation for differential reproduction rates (what geneticists falsely call \"fitness\") among different organisms under relatively stable environmental conditions, and accidental catastrophes like droughts have a far greater effect on breeding rates than any miniscule difference in say, finch beak size, which itself is nothing more than an accident of birth, aka, 'luck'. \n \n \n\n That too is an observable phenomenon. The inevitable logical deduction is that accidentally beneficial mutations will tend to dominate,\n\n \n **\n Whoa!! Don't be trying to sneak the word, \"beneficial\", in, when you think that we're not looking. There is only a hypothetical notion that entropic genetic mutations may, accidentally, be sometimes 'beneficial', i.e., adaptive', for the organisms involved. So far as I know, that notion has never been empirically \n tested. It remains purely presumptive, and is, therefore purely metaphysical.\n Besides, it seems illogical to believe that entropic events in a productive, complex operating system, could ever be 'beneficial' to it. That's one assumption you really do have to prove by the scientific method, or it's no better than another superstition, another appeal to the magic of 'spontaneous generation'.\n \n \n \n\n and this too is what we observe to occur. Sticking your head in the sand and denying it is the unscientific response.\n\n \n **\n Closing your eyes, sticking your fingers in your ears, and screaming , \"Is so, is so, is so!!\", is also an \"unscientific response\". My head is not in any sand, but yours may be in the clouds. :) If you want me to belive your assertion that random, accidental genetic mutations (as opposed to organismically directed genetic mutations, as per my \"EAM\" model) are ever adaptively beneficial to the organism involved, you are going to have to come up with some solid examples to back you up.

   "Right, let's see if I can sum this up (relatively) succinctly:\n \n Your criticisms of the Modern Synthesis:\n \n You claim NS is an empty phrase because 1) it is a tautology, 2) it is impossible to have 'selection' without a guiding intelligence, and that reproductive success does not count as a selection criterion. From this you deduce that the process for which the phrase NS was coined cannot occur.\n \n You also express incredulity that random mutations could accidentally confer statistical reproductive benefit, and claim that this has never been observed. You further assert that claiming adaptive mutations occur at random is a 'metaphysical' statement and impossible to test scientifically. \n \n Finally, at one point I asserted that a mutation can occurbefore  an environmental change to which that mutation is adaptive - which would prove that random mutation can be adaptive. You will find some of the results of my search for such evidence at the bottom of this post.\n \n My observations re. Natural Selection:\n \n The criticism that 'Natural Selection' is a tautology is not a criticism of the process, but of a phrase summarising that process. \"What is amplified, is amplified\" is a simple, tautological sentence describing audio feedback, yet one would not attempt to use a contrived linguistic objection to prove that it cannot occur.\n \n The further criticism, that 'Natural Selection' is an empty phrase because selection is impossible without a guiding intelligence, is also a semantic criticism. A number of different phrases could be coined to describe the same process: \"Logical Preponderance\"; \"Cumulative Statistical Influence of Advantageous Alelle Combinations\" - which do not carry the stigma you perceive 'selection' to possess. Given that you acknowledge the rod you are making for your own back in using the word 'intelligence' to describe adaptability in Vitalism, it strikes me as hypocritical for you to use the equivalent layman's term for the Modern Synthesis as a whipping-horse.\n \n Here is the claim NS makes:\n \n Alelles (or combinations thereof) conferring a reproductive advantage will tend to be passed on to more offspring than alelles that confer a reproductive disadvantage, and thus will tend to be found in a greater proportion of organisms in each successive generation. \n \n If you can logically refute that statement, or find a gap in it, then by all means let's hear it. Save your arguments concerning how, exactly, advantageous alelles arise for later; it's irrelevant here. They could arise at random, through Lamarckism, or be seeded deliberately by a human agent - what I'd be most reassured to hear from you is an admission that, once present in a population, organisms containing the beneficial combinations of alelles will tend to form a greater proportion of the population with each successive generation, even if only because they tend to reproduce more successfully.\n \n My Observations re. Random Mutation:\n \n You express incredulity that random mutations could be beneficial. An argument from incredulity is inherently meaningless, as it is a statement about you, not the subject under discussion\n \n Your second claim, that random adaptive mutation is vacuous, untestable (insert other disparaging adjectives ad nauseam), and cannot be and has not been observed, is false.\n \n This page, and pages linked from it, detail an experiment specifically devised to distinguish between Lamarckian 'induced mutation' and Darwinian 'random mutation'.\n \n In brief:\n \n The experimenter cultured a number of colonies of bacteria, each from a small initial group of cells, and then exposed each colony to a bacteriophage toxin, afterwards counting the number of bacteria surviving in each case.\n \n Lamarckian environmental adaptation, or 'induced mutation', endows all similar bacteria with an equal chance of adaptation and survival to a given novel environment. In a Lamarckian world, one would therefore expect the number of surviving bacteria to be roughly the same in each seperate culture - in this case, few or none, since the phage was really very good at killing bacteria.\n \n In a Darwinian world, on the other hand, where we postulate an accidentally adaptive mutation occurring before the toxin is applied, the number of surviving bacteria in each colony would depend upon how early in the colony's growth the mutation occurred (if at all). For example, in ten 'doublings' of a bacteria colony, 1023 cell divisions will occur. If the random mutation occurs late on, after 1000 cell divisions, only a few bacteria will be resistant and survive. But if the random mutation occurs early on, then a substantial proportion of the colony will inherit resistance. We would therefore expect a different pattern of survival: many colonies with few or no survivors as before, but with the occasional 'jackpot' (as they put it) where the mutation occurred early on and led to a large number of bacteria surviving the later application of the toxin.\n \n The results were unequivocally... Darwinian. The mutation clearly pre-dated the change in environment, and must therefore have been random.\n \n Your personal incredulity concerning the 'lucky variant' situation might be somewhat lessened by a better appreciation of just how much mutation goes on, all the time, and how genetically varied individuals within a population are, or can become within a relatively small time frame, even starting with a single organism. You may find these links edifying, especially the last one.\n \n \nIf you want me to belive your assertion that random, accidental genetic mutations (as opposed to organismically directed genetic mutations, as per my \"EAM\" model) are ever adaptively beneficial to the organism involved, you are going to have to come up with some solid examples to back you up. I promise to give them a very close look.\n\n \n Do that :)\n \n \nYou have earlier agreed that such mutations are strictly entropic. Just how entropic behaviour can increase the efficiency of of an operating system, or in any way lead to an increase in its productivity or complexity, you have yet to explain.\n\n \n If I actually said that every random mutation is strictly entropic, then I hideously misspoke myself. What I think I actually said was that \"Random Mutation\" (note capitals), the process, is entropic. That is to say, if allowed to run its course unchecked, the trend will be towards genetic disorder (of course, it is checked by differential reproductive rates favouring beneficial mutations). I did not say that every possible random mutation was entropic. Equivalently the universe is, on average, entropic, but that does not hold true for every part of it all the time.\n \n As for self-replicating molecules not being self-replicating... well, I think I'm about done arguing ridiculous semantic points and circular logic. I can't call molecules self-replicating because they aren't alive, and they aren't alive because they're not self-replicating. Well, heck, call 'em whatever you like; it doesn't change what they do :)\n \n (By the way, in case you're winding up to attribute yet another false opinion to me, and claim I think molecules are alive, don't bother. I said some molecules self-replicate; it's you who says only things that are alive can be described as self-replicating.)\n \n Incidentally, you've not responded to the other problems I highlighted with vitalism: if only a living thing can possess vitality, how can life arise? Either vitality spontaneously organised dead matter into a living thing (in which case, why don't we still see that happening? Plus it contradicts the assertion that living and dead matter are qualitatively different) or an already complex, self-reproducing structure 'attained' vitality (in which case, complex, self-reproducing structures can arise without vitality).",

   "But 'selection' is not 'selection' in the true and original sense of the word unless it is both intentional and intelligent. \"Natural Selection\" is a humbug. The only way it could exist in materialist fashion, as I've pointed out before, is if it could be observed to act with predictable regularity, always and everywhere. But 150 years of empirical observation show that there is no mechanical regularity in evolution that could be attributed to this supposed \"NS\".\n\n This is a very poorly constructed straw man: you impose your own wholly erroneous conditions on natural selection, show that NS does not meet them, and declare it 'humbug' as a result.\n \n As has been pointed out many times on this forum, natural selection refers simply to differential mortality and differential natality. It has no other meaning, and certainly does not need to have 'intent and intelligence' imposed upon it. There is absolutely no requirement that this differential mortality and natality operate equally or predictably, 'always and everywhere'.\n \n \nBesides, it seems illogical to believe that entropic events in a productive, complex operating system, could ever be 'beneficial' to it.\n\n Couter-intuitive, perhaps, but then so is much else in science. I think you'd be hard pressed to demonstrate that it actually defies logic. What you're in fact presenting is an appeal to incredulity: a very weak argument indeed.",

   "peeling\n Right, let's see if I can sum this up (relatively) succinctly:\n\n \n **\n Fine. Can I start from here and forget about the other posts I haven't caught up to?\n \n \n\n Your criticisms of the Modern Synthesis:\n \n You claim NS is an empty phrase because 1) it is a tautology,\n\n \n ** \n You either don't read what I write, or you just like putting words in my mouth. I've already told that, to me, \"Natural Selection\" is just vacuous gibberish not even worth of tautology status. OTH, \"Survival of the Fittest\" is a self-evident tautology. You may wish to claim that the two verbalisms mean the same thing, abnd who knows, perhaps they do--to you. But they are not the same, according to trhe English language.\n \n \n\n 2) it is impossible to have 'selection' without a guiding intelligence,\n\n \n **\n True. \n \n \n\n and that reproductive success does not count as a selection criterion.\n\n \n **\n True. That's just saying that no matter how things turned out, that whatever is left alive to reproduce, was 'not selected'. That's foolishness. That's like saying that the trees surrounding the one struck by lightening were, 'not selected'. To say that a tree was 'selected' by lightning may be poetic, but I don't think electrons make decisions. There is a qualitative difference between figurative language and empirical fact, and \"Natural Selection\" is a gross example of the fallacy of mistaking the one for the other.\n \n \n \n\n From this you deduce that the process for which the phrase NS was coined cannot occur.\n\n \n **\n Another weird distortion, or outright creation, on your part. I never ever said, thought, or deduced any such thing! The process for which \"NS\" was coined by Charles Darwin was that of biological evolution. I have never denied the reality of evolution. I have denied, (emphatically, repeatedly, and at length), that \"NS\" had anything at all to do with that process.\n \n \n\n You also express incredulity that random mutations could accidentally confer statistical reproductive benefit, and claim that this has never been observed.\n\n \n **\n True. If you do believe they do so, (not _could_, but actually _do_), then back it up with links that demonstrate empirically that adaptive (beneficial to the organism and its reproductive success) genetic mutations are just as accidental and entropic as those that cause weakness and defects severe enough to lower an organism's chances of positive reproduction differentials. You can't, because it's an empty, 'post hoc ergo procter hoc', assumption. Pure metaphysics.\n \n \n\n You further assert that claiming adaptive mutations occur at random is a 'metaphysical' statement and impossible to test scientifically. \n\n \n **\n True. If you disagree, link to a paper that describes a scientific test of that proposition, as per the scientific method. \n \n \n\n Finally, at one point I asserted that a mutation can occurbefore an environmental change to which that mutation is adaptive - which would prove that random mutation can be adaptive. You will find some of the results of my search for such evidence at the bottom of this post.\n\n \n **\n I look forward to critiquing it.\n \n \n\n My observations re. Natural Selection:\n \n The criticism that 'Natural Selection' is a tautology is not a criticism of the process, but of a phrase summarising that process.\n\n \n **\n True, though it's not my criticism. IMHO, \"Natural Selection\" is just too senseless to be a tautology. But what is the \"process\" that you believe \"NS\", \"summaris[es]\", and just how do those two words summarise it?\n Surely not \"evolution\"!!!\n \n \n\n The further criticism, that 'Natural Selection' is an empty phrase because selection is impossible without a guiding intelligence, is also a semantic criticism.\n\n \n **\n Preposterous! \"Meaning\" is what semantics, semiotics, linguists, symbology, and whatnot, are all about. That is, a word represents/signifies a commonly\n shared and agreed upon meaning. (Unless you are Humpty Dumpty, in which case a word means whatever you choose it to mean, as that character pointed out to Alice.) When discussing words, \"semantic criticism[s]\" are all there are, and they are all important, too! You cannot use a word that has a clear and established meaning as if it meant something quite different, just because you wish it had that meaning. The word selection entails intelligent discrimination between choices according a given criterion. It is an exercise in judgement requiring at least an awareness of options (such as 'fight or flight').\n It need not be conscious, but it must be mental, not mechanical. Mechanical operations have no options or choices or judgements-they are determined. Accidents are not 'selective', either, or they wouldn't be accidents. That is why \"Natural Selection\" is just an absurdity put forward as an insight.\n \n \n\n A number of different phrases could be coined to describe the same process: \"Logical Preponderance\"; \"Cumulative Statistical Influence of Advantageous Alelle Combinations\" - which do not carry the stigma you perceive 'selection' to possess.\n\n \n **\n I dunno. They sound equally ridiculous and meaningless to me. \n \n \n \n\n Given that you acknowledge the rod you are making for your own back in using the word 'intelligence' to describe adaptability in Vitalism,\n\n \n **\n There you go again, accusing me of \"using the word 'intelligence' to describe adaptability\", meaning you accuse me of equating the two, which I do not. And, meaning that you interpret my definition of 'intelligence' as equating it to 'adaptibility'!! That is your mistake, not mine. Will you please stop doing that?!? \n For the last time, 'adaptability' is only the most basic stage and portion and kind of 'intelligence', shared by all living organisms in varying degrees. Just as all aspects of intelligence vary among all individuals and taxons to different degrees. Once and for all--- I DO NOT USE THE WORD \"INTELLIGENCE\" TO DESCRIBE \"ADAPTABILITY\". I USE THE WORD \"INTELLIGENCE\" TO INCLUDE \"ADAPTABILITY\"!! For pity's sake, cut it out!\n \n I think I'd better take a break.",

   "continuation-\n \npeeling\n Here is the claim NS makes:\n \n Alelles (or combinations thereof) conferring a reproductive advantage will tend to be passed on to more offspring than alelles that confer a reproductive disadvantage, and thus will tend to be found in a greater proportion of organisms in each successive generation.\n\n \n and\n \n \n once present in a population, organisms containing the beneficial combinations of alelles will tend to form a greater proportion of the population with each successive generation, even if only because they tend to reproduce more successfully.\n\n \n **\n This whole thing is tautologous. Who forms the greater proportion of the population? Those with \"the beneficial combinations of alleles\"? How do you know which alleles are 'beneficial'? They are the alleles possessed by those who \"form a greater proportion of the population with each successive generation\". This is just 'survival of the fittest ' dressed in its best hat. All tautologies are truisms, per se, and as such they convey no meaning, but merely use themselves to describe themselves. Thus your premise is vacuous.\n \n \n\n My Observations re. Random Mutation:\n \n You express incredulity that random mutations could be beneficial. An argument from incredulity is inherently meaningless, as it is a statement about you, not the subject under discussion.\n\n \n **\n Wrong. An argument from _personal_ incredulity, that is one founded on neither fact nor logic, is a fallacious argument. That is not the case with me. My incredulity is based upon logic and empirical observation of the world, and ability to use them as intellectual tools with which to distinguish true from false. It is entirely illogical and irrational to claim that genotypic entropy (random genetic mutations) can cause a decrease in phenotypic entropy, i.e., adaptedness. It is a self-contradiction. And that is why I am incredulous. What I don't get is how you darwinists can be so credulous as to believe a self-defeating proposition?!? Sounds like an act of faith, positively religious, to me.\n \n \n\n Your second claim, that random adaptive mutation is vacuous, untestable (insert other disparaging adjectives ad nauseam), and cannot be and has not been observed, is false.\n\n \n **\n Well, that's your opinion.\n \n \n\n This page, and pages linked from it, detail an experiment specifically devised to distinguish between Lamarckian 'induced mutation' and Darwinian 'random mutation'.\n\n \n **\n I knew, and predicted in this thread, that you'd eventually bring up Luria/Delbruck 1943, since that's all you've got, apart from Lederberg & Lederburg (1954?). Strange how your all- important principle lives or dies by those two old experiments.\n \n \n\n In brief:\n \n The experimenter cultured a number of colonies of bacteria, each from a small initial group of cells, and then exposed each colony to a bacteriophage toxin, afterwards counting the number of bacteria surviving in each case.\n\n \n **\n Well, I suppose you could call that the abridged version of the protocols. No matter, cutting to the chase, the bottom line is that the conclusion you draw from the results is a flat-out metaphysical assumption. Delbruck himself never made that mistake. But the implications inferred from the results were, then and now, based on the poor understanding, circa 1941-1990, of how eusocial bacteia like e.coli. operate.\n The first major misconception was/is that these bacteria operate as separate, autonomous individuals. They don't. The colony as a whole is the only \"individual\". Your cells are not individuals, you are. Same for E.Coli.\n \n But back to the results. The only conclusion Luria and Delbruck (mistakenly) drew from them was that the resistance to streptomycin was instantiated, de novo, in his bacteria cultures prior to the exposure to the streptomycin phage. From that, others extrapolated that the mutations were strictly accidental, and had nothing to do with exposure to streptomycin. They 'just happened, by spontaneous generation' the day before the cultures were exposed, and the 'random mutation', needed.\n \n Upon what do they found this speculative assumption? Well, the statistical distribution of survivors over several different plated cultures. That is, they \"looked random\". Well, appearances can be deceiving, but that never stopped a darwinist from leaping to a conclusion that suited his ideology.\n \n The problem with it is that intelligent outcomes also 'appear' random. Only mechanical causes give uniform outcomes. Walk from class to class in various schools in various places, asking the same question of kids of the same age in various classrooms, that is, a question they've never been asked before, and you aren't going to get a uniform distribution of correct answers from one class to another. You are going to get a range of distributions between the classes tested. That doesn't mean that the kids answered randomly, without thought. It just looks that way. The neo-lamarkian, 'directed mutagenesis', does not claim that all bacteria cultures, or students, are equally 'smart, and so must furnish the same number of phage resistants, or right answers, uniformly, from plate to plate or class to class.\n \n But, you ask, didn't the resistance have to occur accidentally, spontaneously, prior to exposure, since the bacteria couldn't 'know', consciously or unconsciously, that they were going to be plated? Well. there are two assumptions imbedded in this question. They are--A/ That the mutation happened prior to being plated, and B/, that the mutation happened randomly, by spontaneous generation and incredible good luck.\n \n Taking them one at a time. Let us say that, for the sake of argument, A/ is correct, and the mutation took place just before the plating and this exposure to streptomycin. Now, in that case, let's look at B/.\n The streptomycin bacillus has been around, attacking e.coli. bacteria, for millions of years. During that time, e.coli. had to develop resistance or get wiped out. Leaving aside, for the moment, the issue of whether or not that original resistance was the result of spontaneous generation, a fluky accident, or a directed organismic response to the phage, we can all agree with the demonstrated fact that prior to this experiment e.coli had already developed resistance to the phage. Indeed, among the protocols was one designed to eliminate all existing cells with the resistance gene, so that the primary culture contained no resistant cells. The assumption was, that if you start from something that has no resistance, it has to start from scratch to acquire it. That was wrong. Decades later it was postulated that maintaining resistance to a phage is very energy expensive, and so it would be allowed to go dormant in most individuals in a colony, but would be activated in some, apparently by the colony as a whole. This would explain why, after exposure to a phage from which only resistant cells escaped alive, that within a very few generations the colonies would revert to normal, with each holding only a few resistant cells.\n Of course, darwinists pooh-poohed this, saying that it was more rational to believe that, just as spontaneous generat was responsible for the appearance of resistance, spontaneous degeneration was responsible for its disappearance. Much is made of the fact that e.coli. resistance to this particular phage involves only a single point mutation, and everybody knows that there are hordes of gamma rays zapping everything all the time. Sounds like a stretch, to me.\n \n Anyhoo,this 'immune mechanism' sounds similar to the 'reverse mutation' found in experiments in the 80's wherein bacteria engineeered to be lactose intolerant reverted immediately to lactose tolerance when starved and put in its presence. I can't remember the actual details, it's been a long time since I looked at it. There is also something called, \"The Ames Test\", which I've also forgotten, except that it is something similar.\n \n Anyhow, point being, if a bacteria colony, or culture, possesses an internal ability to make sure that at least some of its members are always phage resistant, as a sort of organismic immune defence, then the resistant bacteria would have been generated intentionally, and not as the result of a random accident.\n \n \n But to continue. Fine, we now know that saying that the mutation occurred spontaneously, ex nihilo, is just an unfounded assumption, and a highly dubious one at that. It could simply be part and parcel of what makes e.coli., e.coli. So let's go back to assumption A/, that the mutation occurred before, and without immediate exposure to the phage.\n \n It is claimed that it would have had to have done, because every cell would otherwise have no phage resistance, and so every single cell would have died if some hadn't developed resistance prior to plating. This is the assumption that keeps us losing the bacteria/antibiotic wars. It is based upon that false assumption mentioned earlier, of dealing with bacteria as if each one was an independent, autonomous individual. E.coli. colonies, as collectives, have developed communication channels by which information is passed from cell to cell. If a phage is attacking the colonies perimeter, the inner cells soon know all about it, and spring into action, hypermutating in an heuristic search for the best possible answer to this immediate and vital problem. Even if the smartest bacteriologist in the world develops a brand new antibiotic that they cannot possibly have encountered in all their millions of years of history, guess what? Within a very short number of generations, far shorter than could be expected by random 'blind firing', they develop a resistance to that specific antibiotic, and we need another genius to come up with something else. How do they do it? Communication is something only intelligent organisms can do. Eusocial bacteria are intelligent. Unless every single cell in a colony is exposed to the phage at one and the same time, some of them have time to both mutate and reproduce. Devo-evo comes back in force.\n \n Now, the thing about 'plating' is that it's sort of like spreading jam on bread. You get lumps. Not every bacterium is exposed at the same time. Some have enough time to devo-evo resistance before the phage reaches them. Since lumps, and their respective sizes, would be random and scattered, survivors would also bescattered, and look random, even though in actual fact their survival was no accident. \n \n \n\n Lamarckian environmental adaptation, or 'induced mutation', endows all similar bacteria with an equal chance of adaptation and survival to a given novel environment.\n\n \n **\n Another false claim! No, it most certainly does not. It could only do such a thing if it maintained that every member of a phenotype was an exact clone of every other member, no difference or variation allowed. That would be stupid to the point of insane for anyone who claims that that is the world he sees. There is variation in all traits, and intelligence and its 'adaptability' are no exception. Life isn't fair and no two individuals get 'an equal chance' at anything, not even in our formalised games. No lamarckian ever said otherwise.\n \n \n\n In a Lamarckian world, one would therefore expect the number of surviving bacteria to be roughly the same in each seperate culture\n\n \n **\n To the contrary. See my student survey analogy, above, and my 'lumps' proposal. You would only expect uniformity in a mechanically determined case. The only thing that this experiment demonstrates unequivocally is that successful bacterial resistance is not physically mechanical and predetermined, as you might expect that materialist/mechanists would wish it to be.\n \n \n Time for a break to take a look at your links.",

   "Trying to catch up with the backlog---\n \n \n hi it's me\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n A superstition passed off as a scientific principle, for heaven's sake!! \n \n I certainly hope that you are not here to advocate ID as a scientific theory.\n\n \n **\n I believe that \"ID\" is now pretty much just an euphemism for fundamentalist biblical literalism. That could not be more, \"not me\".\n \n \n\n I would also like to point out a few flaws in your reasoning, starting here:\n \n Quote:\n ...intelligent 'selection' (the only real, true, and actual 'selection' there can be) \n \n Because I don't want to play word games, here is a definition of selection:\n \"To take as a choice from among several; pick out.\"\n This definition does not require \"intelligence,\" \n\n \n **\n Yes, it does. Just try making a choice without using your mental faculties.\n \n \n\n and even if it did, all you can show with that argument is that \"natural selection\" is poorly named.\n\n \n **\n 'Poorly named' is not far from 'misleadingly named' which is even closer to 'deceptively named' and 'dishonestly named' .\n \n \n\n There are processes which can \"select\" one item rather than others. For example, consider a filter. Filters allow some things through and prevent others from passing. This is done without any form of intelligence (even intelligence as you define it). Rather, it is done based on size, chemical composition, polarity, etc.\n\n \n **\n This is not selecting. This is mechanical 'sorting'. I've already discussed this. I gave as an example streams that sort through hydrodynamics the sort of stone, sand, and gravel deposited. Did you miss that?\n If darwinists wanted to be honest and true to their materialist/mechanist ideology, they would call their purported evolutionary mechanism, \"Natural Sorting\". But see, that name just wouldn't win over a lot of converts. Besides, it strongly suggests the regularity and uniformity and universality of the laws of physics in their mechanism for evolutionary biology, when anyone with even half an eye can see that that just isn't there.\n \n \n\n Similarly, natural selection is a process which selects traits of organisms based on the reproductive rates of the organisms in question.\n\n \n **\n Where's the similarity between a mechanical filter and an intelligent choice/selection? I only see differences. Chiefly that what and how the sorting will be done by a filter is predetermined, regular, uniform, and predictable, just from the immutable and permanent properties of the filter itself. Try that on your \"Natural Selection\".\n \n \n\n In short, traits which allow/cause an organism to reproduce more will begin to appear in a greater percent of the organism's population.\n\n \n **\n Vacuous tautology. \n \n \n\n Examples of such traits would be the absence of tusks in elephants, heat tolerance in bacteria, and pesticide resistance in rats.\n\n \n **\n Certainly when you shoot elephants, but only those with tusks, you are making an intelligent, if illegal selection. In this manner poaching is akin to good old fashioned animal breeding. That is, to intentionlly subtract a certain trait from a gene pool by killing those that express it, leaving behind only those that do not express is. This is the very practice that Darwin the stock breeder called \"Natural Selection\", ignoring the fact that stock breeding and poaching both require an intelligent human choice based upon differentiation among alternatives according to an arbitrary criterion. In this case, tusks. \n \n The only way to carry this over into the non-human world was to posit, without appearing to, some kind of mystic intelligence that made choices the same way. \"Mother Nature\", like some kind of pagan earth spirit, was out there breeding organisms, making \"Natural Selections\". Pure superstitious nonsense.\n \n We all know about breeding (artificial selection). Nothing new here, and nothing about natural, non-intentional, mechanical or chance-based evolution.\n \n \n\n Here's another problem quote:\n \n Quote:\n ...\"Natural Selection\", a metaphysical postulate falsely decreed to be a mechanical regularity, a universal force, a a mystical agency paraded as if it were as regular and predictable and physically mechanical as the laws of physics and chemistry!! \n \n 1) Natural selection is not as predictable as the various laws of physics and chemistry. However, the theory of evolution by natural selection does make predictions which can be tested and have been confirmed.\n\n \n **\n Not true. Mendel's theory of inheritance makes predictions which can be tested and confirmed, such as the presence of trait links in intermediaries between different fossils of the same 'bloodline' over time.\n Check it out. Everything scientific, verifiable, and predictable about what darwinists call evolution by RM+NS is really derived from the genetic theory of inheritance, which is about how traits are conserved and expressed over generations, and not evolution, which is about how traits change, alter, and originate despite the mendelian (genetic) mechanism for stability and stasis.\n \n \n\n 2) Natural selection is not \"a a mystical agency.\" It involves populations,\n\n \n **\n A statistical abstraction.\n \n \n\n organisms within the populations,\n\n \n **\n As statistical sums, not as biological organisms. More abstraction, the study of arithmetical entities in place of real organisms. \n \n \n\n Given a set of circumstances, it can be used to predict what will happen to a population.\n\n \n **\n That's good for biometrics and ecology, but populations aren't organisms, and so it it cannot and does not predict the path of organismic evolution in real organisms. Just makes projections, (not even predictions, for pete's sake, merely projections!!) about mathematical developments.\n \n \n\n However, when it is used this way, it could be easily mistaken for common sense (e.g. if poachers are killing elephants with the longest tusks, you might expect more tuskless elephants to be born).\n\n \n **\n You got that right. And that's the 'common sense' rule of \"Blending Inheritance\" employed by stock breeders, including dog breeders, for over 10,000 years. Darwin really came up with nothing new, except a deceptive, misleading catch-phrase that made the 19th century materialists, including the nouveau riche bourgeoisie, very happy about themselves. \n \n \n \n\n I do want to know, though:\n What makes you think that a fifth \"force\" called vitality is required to explain organisms which can also be well explained by chemistry?\n\n \n **\n Explain the difference between live organisms and dead one's, using chemistry alone.

That is, to intentionlly subtract a certain trait from a gene pool by killing those that express it, leaving behind only those that do not express is. This is the very practice that Darwin the stock breeder called \"Natural Selection\", ignoring the fact that stock breeding and poaching both require an intelligent human choice based upon differentiation among alternatives according to an arbitrary criterion. In this case, tusks. \n \n The only way to carry this over into the non-human world was to posit, without appearing to, some kind of mystic intelligence that made choices the same way. \"Mother Nature\", like some kind of pagan earth spirit, was out there breeding organisms, making \"Natural Selections\".

The four physical forces never quit, so it isn't any of them.\n\n \n Didn't you take a biology course? Organisms die of \"old age\" because their DNA can only replicate so many times before it erodes. Without the ability to replicate DNA, your cells can't reproduce, and your body wares down. This is why older people experience heart attacks, strokes, bone diseases, and cancer on a larger scale than younger people do. Some unfortunate children are born with fast-eroding DNA, and they usually don't make it past ten years of age. Why does their entire body \"age up\" 50 times faster than normal? I can tell you it isn't because of a lack of vitality, or the \"quitting\" of any other force for that matter. The proximate cause of all death is a breakdown in the physical substances, which in turn disable the organism from utilizing any forces.\n \n The process is started at conception, when the sperm fertilizes the egg and forms a zygote. If you want to go back all the way to Abiogenesis over the who-knows-how-many generations, the hypothesized beginning is that the physical substance formed first through molecular replication, a naturally-occurring event. Throw in a bolt of lightning, and as Dr. Frankenstein would say, \"It's alive!\"\n \n \nAll that is necessary for what? Population growth, extinction? What has any of that to do with evolution? Evolution is about the origin of traits, not their after effects.\n\n \n Uh... No, the ToE states that life changes over time. Because NS is part of the ToE, I'd have to ask you how it's limited to explaining only the origin of traits.\n \n \nInstead of the small number who were already warfarin resistant? So what? All that you are playing on is the trivial truism that dead rats have fewer offspring than live rats.

You have the burden of proof to show that organisms have vitality and robots do not.\n \n \nYou call that \"close\"!?!? No offense, but you seem really eager to grasp at any straw that might support your hopes and expectations.\n\n \n I assume you and Hi It's Me are speaking of the protocells.

And what was that? Dead organisms that once were alive. Surely you've already seen a few, if only by the side of the road?!?\n As I've said again and again, if the four physical forces were that causal agency which is responsible for life, then, since the four physical forces are ubiquitous and perpetual, then no living thing would ever die. But the truth is, as revealed in the brute fact of death, that not only do live organisms die in spite of the 4 physical forces, they often die because of them. \n \n Your trying to make an apt comparison between your supposed, 'pigeons proove \"NS\" is real', and my indisputable, 'death proves vitality is real', is pathetically wrong-headed.",

   "Let's see if johnhanks is more sensible than collin and heyitsme.\n \n \n\n For the record, some of us here are biologists by profession, and quite fluent in the 'Latin'; we don't rely on anyone else's interpretations.\n\n \n **\n Yes, no doubt some of you have been ordained into the priesthood of materialist/phyicalist/mechanist/positivist/naturalist cosmology, but most, I suspect, are just members of the choir.\n \n \n\n Some of us are also familiar with the history of vitalism (such as Bergson's notorious elan vitale) and its emphatic failure to achieve any kind of scientific credibility whatsoever.\n\n \n **\n Except that the 'history' you are familiar with is the 'history' that your own people wrote. Not so much, 'history', as polemic.\n \n If want to review all that with me, then just 'bring it on', as they say.\n \n \n\n 'Death proves vitality is real'? Nonsense. It proves that in complex multicellular organisms with interdependent systems the eventual failure of one system or another (for reasons outlined by Collin) deprives the others of the essentials to stay alive.\n\n \n **\n All you are doing is describing the mechanics of death in eukaryotes; you are not explaining what it is. Yes, the failure of one system to externally supply the input into another system that that system needs in order to continue its 'life' functions, those that result according to the biological mechanism,\n \" intrinsic vitality plus external input into an open complex biosystem = life and its special behaviours\", fails, and death results in that 'starved', broken system. Simply because its vitality has nothing to work with.\n \n It doesn't matter whether it's a bullet to the heart that stops the circulatory system from delivering input to cells, or the digestive system failing to deliver input to the circulatory system, or whatever. In multi-systematic eukaryotes that are interdependent, that is, where the life functions of each system are dependent upon the input into themselves of those necessessities that were first produced or transported to them by other systems, the failure of one to carry out its function often leads to the failure of all, i.e., that is true death and the loss of vitality. Leading to the four forces then driving entropic disintegration of the totality. \n \n Now, you want to deny the role that vitality plays in life. Correct me if I misunderstand you, but is seems that you want to take my neo-vitalist mechanism for life and death, as given above, and insist vitality is not only unnecessary to the life mechanism, but that it has no real existance whatsoever. You would put my mechanism [ intrinsic vitality, plus external input into an open complex biosystem = life and its special behaviours], this way, in materialist fashion--\n \"external chemical input into an open complex biosystem = equals biochemical behaviours\". Which really is not saying anything, and it basically tautologous.\n But it sounds sensible enough, that is, until someone asks for particulars of just how these 'inputs' are transformed into the particular special outputs of the system receiving them, and not simple entropuic waste products. \"Oh, it just happens, that's all.\" is an evasion, not an explanation. \"Oh, the laws of chemistry make it happen.\", is no beter, because in science the word 'law' simply means a repeatable, regularly occuring 'cause/effect' event, an event that really requires an explanation, but for which materialism seldom has anything to offer.. \n \n Leaving aside the fact that your materialism has no explanation or causal agency with which to account for this 'regularity' in existence itself, (Beyond the usual vacant and absurd, \"I just happens, that's all.\"), in the case of biology and life you ignore the necessity of an agent or agency needed to drive the chemistry that turns a systems inputs into productive, as opposed to simply waste, outputs. If chemistry, as you suppose, could do this on its own, then chemists should be churning out real organisms in their labs. They've tried for years, but although they found stuff that looks like the stuff that live things are made of, that is, stuff that has the necessary chemical componetry, these things still do not 'come to life', (and thus, never 'die', either).\n \n \n So, if its not 'the proper chemistry' that's missing, [and after their 50 years of study, I find it hard to believe that biochemists haven't yet figured out the proper chemistry involved), then it must be something else, something that isn't chemistry, but something that directs and runs that chemistry productively, teleogically, towards specified goals and purposes. The something I call the natural, but non-physical, force-- vitality.\n \n \n\n Unicells can go on dividing indefinitely: do they have an infinite supply of 'vitality'?\n\n \n **\n Not quite, since infinity is just an arithmetic place-holder. You can imagine it, sort of, but in reality it simply cannot be. But never mind. \n \n So long as 'unicells' can continue to divide, i.e., indefinitely, then they must have an indefinite supply of vitality to pass on. Any individual cell would have an indefinite supply of vitality, except that eventually entropy overcomes the physical plant, vitality is unable to work with the deteriorated material, the cell ceases to function productively, i.e., dies, and its personal share of vitality is lost.\n In the broadest terms, vitality uses the corporeal, the substantial, and the the physical, in order to increase and sustain itself. Life does not \"just happen, that's all\". Your 'spontaneous generation' is superstition, not science.",

WW, you show nothing but contempt, yet accuse others of arrogance. Meanwhile, you have yet to do anything but flap your gums and point out areas in need of further research. Your last post was just laughable-\"gasoline vapours and oxygen, [\"moving molecules\"] come together coincidentally, by random accident, in an engine cylinder, something that 'spontaneously generated itself from random metal molecules, whereupon an 'enzyme-like' something, i.e., the expressed force we know as electricity,coincidentally in that place at that time, causes \"an expected, reproducable(sic), regular, etc. chemical reaction\". ROTFL\"\n \n Smarten up. You very well know (at least, I hope you do), that chemical reactions are naturally occuring, and extremely predictable. We humans managed to figure out how to put one to use in the above example. How does that disprove chemistry? And a designed machine in no way compares to a living organism (other than superficially), no matter how much you state they are similar. Your whole schtick is tiring, and I really hope Collin, Hi It's Me, and Johnhanks just ignore you already, as their energies are better used in other pursuits.\n \n You want to insist that an undetectable force is responsible for everything. Show some proof. Saying \"explain life then!\" Doesn't cut it. A lack of an exact scientific explanation does not mean that you're free to invent a fifth force and endow it with metaphysical properties. I can just as easily say that life is caused by little invisible men who sit in each cell and direct it, and the cells die when these little invisible men reach retirement age and abandon their posts. Want proof? Fine, if I'm wrong, you tell me how life arises. If you can't prove your explanation to my satisfaction, my little-men theory must obviously be correct.",

Darwin used the term anyway because it was an apt parallel to his analogy of 'artificial selection' in the case of livestock breeders: rather than a person choosing desirable traits and breeding accordingly, 'nature' - ie the ongoing process of reproducing and competing for resources - would inevitably 'select' advantageous traits.\n \n You deny calling NS a tautology, and instead call the other layman's term for the same process, 'survival of the fittest', a tautology instead. Rather than waste more electricity dealing with this cheap verbal chicanery, I refer you to my previous posts dealing with NS as a feedback process, substituting SOTF as appropriate.\n \n I've asked you several times to refute the statistical prediction that reproductively advantageous traits will proliferate, and your only detectably relevant response is to say that evolution is about how new traits arise, not what happens afterwards. I am forced to conclude that you tacitly accept the statistical validity of NS.\n \n RE: Vitalism as an explanation for abiogenesis:\n \n Your responses amounts to 'I don't know how vitality was involved in the emergence of life', which isn't a terribly convincing answer when both possibilities are internally contradictory.\n \n RE: Points to which you have yet to respond:\n \n You have studiously ignored the case of the nylon-eating bacteria - another example of an isolated Darwinian 'jackpot'. No behavioural change or colonial concensus would enable those bacteria to process nylon in the absence of the mutation.\n \n You have also failed to retract your criticism of the term 'emergence', in light of my observation that your description of vitalism requires 'intelligence' to emerge from the combination of Vitality and an organism's physical parts.\n \n Finally, you have supplied no evidence or reasoning to support your assertion that random mutations cannot be accidentally adaptive. Since random changes to complex systems demonstrably are accidentally adaptive on occasion, and whole industries depend for their livelihood on this 'metaphysical' assertion, you have a lot of convincing to do. Indeed, between this and your abject failure to even attempt to refute the statistical influences collectively termed 'Natural Selection', you have thus far failed to demonstrate any gap in the evolutionary process for 'vitality' to fill.\n \n As things stand, then, vitality is neither an explanation for the origin of life, nor a requirement for its evolution.

There's no evidence of anything involved being 'lumpy', and plenty of processes successfully rely on an even application of a given material, so it's hardly impossible to achieve.\n\n \n \n **\n I was merely speculating about how they plated e.coli. in 1943, as in the aforesaid experiment. I suspect that at that time, they did not get a plate with an even spread exactly one cell deep across the board. Certainly not on the 100 plates involved at one time. But even if they did, (which you must surely find as unlikely as I do), the LD experiment, as you must know, was based on 10 separate cultures taken from one [assumed] non-resistant culture, with each of those subdivided again another twn times, making a total of one hundred plates. Because they assumed that they had started with one resistance free culture, but since the one hundred plates showed irregular instances of resistance, they assumed from this distribution that the resistance had been generated prior to and without reference to the actual plating. Others made a further leap and claimed that the resistance that did arise, arose by spontaneous generation, i.e., accidental genetic mutation, because the distributions 'looked random' in the abstract, statistical sense.\n \n The basic assumption being that bacteria cells, being asexual clones, were therefore completely identical, and that since they were just as passive as different coloured grains of sand, let's say, that after being shaken up and divided ten time, then shaken again and separated into 100 distinct clusters, that if they look like the random distribution that one colour of sand particles sand might make after such an experience, (and they resistant cells did look like that), then the resistance was every bit as random and accidental as the distribution of one colour in 100 little piles of sand. Assumptions galore, most of them proved wrong by later microbiology. Assumptions and appearances are poor things to base a scientific principle upon, IMHO.\n \n \n\n There's no reason to suppose that some cultures were inherently more 'intelligently adaptable' than others.\n\n \n **\n You don't think so? Are all living things equally intelligent? If not, then why should all bacteria cells be equally \"intelligently adaptable\"? In fact, if you could demonstate that they were, I'd be very surprised. But that is not the issue. The issue is two-fold. First, we now no that bacterial 'resistance' is something arises, eusocially, in multi-celled colonies that have gone through several generations of development/redevelopment. Not in singleton, isolated cells. \n \n Furthermore, we now know that bacteria have epigenetic memory, and revert easily to any genetic formation established at some point in their long history.\n \n And that some organisms, (see mice and warfarin), in order to reduce energy consumption, allow specific traits to go temporarily dormant, to be resuscitated on demand.\n \n And then there's my 'lumpy jam' scenario, coupled to the fact of 'quorum sensing' in eusocial bacteria.\n \n \n\n Even if that were possible, we would still not expect to see the anomalous 'jackpot' results - rather we would expect results to vary relatively smoothly from 'no adaptation' to 'high degree of adaptation'.\n\n \n \n **\n I don't know what you mean by \"smoothly\". To me, 'smoothly' entails a mechanical sort of gradualism, the next best thing to a mechanical uniformity and 'sameness'. On the contrary, the distributions of small colonies in each plate varied erratically, irregularly, and so, APPARENTLY 'randomly', over the 100 plates. But that distribution could have have arisen simply by normal trait variation, the trait being 'intelligent adaptability'.\n \n In this fashion--\n \n A/ single culture of supposed non-resistant cells, allowed to multiply and develop over some 24 hours. (I forget. Would that make 5,000 generations?)\n \n B/ten cultures dipped randomly from this culture and kept separate for a further 24 hours\n \n C/ten phage plates each coated with e.coli from one of these cultures from of these cultures, repeated for each of the other nine, the one hundred plates kept separate for a further 24 hours.\n \n D/All plates examined for the sum of phage- resistant e.coli colonies found on each plate. (To my knowledge, not a single one of the plates contained no resistant bacteria at all. Strange, I should have thought, for a stochastically random result.) The colony numbers were compared, let us say 'vertically', to the other nine taken from the same culture, and also 'horizontally', to each of the other nine plates taken from the nine separate cultures/colonies. The erratic, irregular distributions appeared to be purely stochastic.\n \n But, suppose that in the 24 hours during which the first culture, the supposedly 'resistance-free' culture, multiplied and developed, that a portion of it, but not all (it's never 'all or nothing' with e.coli :)), reverted to resistance, and that when that culture was divided in ten, each exemplar contained a varied quantity of resistant cells. Cells which, in the next 24 hours-- {or even without. I'm trying to describe the protocols from memory, but I no longer have a reliable memory to work with.} multiply unevenly in the absence of any immediate environment stimulus or pruner, such as you characterise your \"NS\". Then they are plated, with each of them yielding ten plates taken randomly from their peti dish, or whatever, with random quantities of resistant colonies, and are left to develop. In the morning the distribution looks randon, in the sense of 100 hands from a well-shuffled deck, with the actual cards employed fixed and limited by design, as certain individuals in certain suits.\n \n I prefer the 'lumpy jam' response to stimuli scenario, which would be straightforwardly Lamarckian, but even this, ('mutated prior to contact, but teleologically, not stochastically mutated)', scenario removes the necessity for a random, accidental genetic change, as postulated by RM+NS.\n \n It's late.

Try this XXXX on somebody else.\n \n ==========================================================\n \n \n \n I refer you to my previous posts dealing with NS as a feedback process, substituting SOTF as appropriate.\n \n I've asked you several times to refute the statistical prediction that reproductively advantageous traits will proliferate, and your only detectably relevant response is to say that evolution is about how new traits arise, not what happens afterwards. I am forced to conclude that you tacitly accept the statistical validity of NS.\n \n RE: Vitalism as an explanation for abiogenesis:\n \n Your responses amounts to 'I don't know how vitality was involved in the emergence of life', which isn't a terribly convincing answer when both possibilities are internally contradictory.\n \n RE: Points to which you have yet to respond:\n \n You have studiously ignored the case of the nylon-eating bacteria - another example of an isolated Darwinian 'jackpot'. No behavioural change or colonial concensus would enable those bacteria to process nylon in the absence of the mutation.\n \n You have also failed to retract your criticism of the term 'emergence', in light of my observation that your description of vitalism requires 'intelligence' to emerge from the combination of Vitality and an organism's physical parts.\n \n Finally, you have supplied no evidence or reasoning to support your assertion that random mutations cannot be accidentally adaptive. Since random changes to complex systems demonstrably are accidentally adaptive on occasion, and whole industries depend for their livelihood on this 'metaphysical' assertion, you have a lot of convincing to do. Indeed, between this and your abject failure to even attempt to refute the statistical influences collectively termed 'Natural Selection', you have thus far failed to demonstrate any gap in the evolutionary process for 'vitality' to fill.\n \n As things stand, then, vitality is neither an explanation for the origin of life, nor a requirement for its evolution. So what's it for?",

   "We'll see. Summations often lead to false interpretations, out of context quote-mining, and downright chicanery, such as putting one's own words in your opponent's mouth. Which is why I stick to direct quotes.\n\n \n Not that this practice has prevented you assigning me at least three false opinions over the course of this discussion :) I think it is at least useful to summarise occasionally to avoid getting bogged down.\n \n \nWell, I will admit that liquids and gasses adapt themselves to the shape of the containers that hold them. But that is the only form of \"intelligence free\" adaptability that I am familiar with. But I don't see how that would apply to biological evolution, our chosen topic of discussion.\n\n \n What I'm trying to establish is whether you're saying that all biological adaptation is (or must be) intelligently driven, or that all biological adaptation counts as intelligence. Do you appreciate the difference? \n \n To non-vitalists, 'intelligence' has certain connotations; not necessarily physical, but - well, I suppose the best word I can think of is 'procedural'. For example, intelligence necessarily involves considering the potential consequences of actions before taking them. If an entity or system doesn't in some way model the world and consider the consequences of possible responses before choosing them, then logically the responses it does give are mechanical and predetermined; encoded in some fashion in the physical (or physical/vital) makeup of the system. The complexity of the response is irrelevant as to whether it is intelligent.\n \n So when you say adaptation in bacteria is intelligent, are you simply advocating that we change our understanding of intelligence so that consideration of consequences is not a requirement, or are you saying that bacteria/colonies are capable of considering the result of possible responses to stimuli?\n \n \nWhat experiment? Luria/Delbruck (1943) was not designed to test for Lamarckism, \n\n \n I refer you to back to the page I linked, and to the page linked within that article, where this can be found:\n \n \nTwo explanations for this unexpected variation confronted the scientific community: either (1) exposure to the virus had caused some small proportion of the bacteria to become immune and able to pass this immunity on to their offspring, or (2) the virus-resistant form already existed in the colony prior to the introduction of the virus - having arisen through mutation - and it was selected for by the addition of the virus.\n \n To determine which explanation was correct, Salvador Luria and Max Delbruck, working together at Cold Spring Harbor during World War II, devised a test. \n\n \n The experiment was designed specifically to distinguish via statistical methods between Lamarkian 'induced mutation' and Darwinian 'accidentally adaptive mutation'.\n \n \nUhm, that was not my analogy. The question in my analogy was stipulated to be one they were unfamiliar with prior to its being asked of them. Go back and check. You may spot that on second reading.\n\n \n Quite right, and I apologise. I will pursue my argument from a different direction.\n \n \nthe LD experiment, as you must know, was based on 10 separate cultures taken from one [assumed] non-resistant culture, with each of those subdivided again another twn times, making a total of one hundred plates.\n\n \n That isn't the procedure described in any of the literature I can find. Can you provide a link? Here are some slides illustrating the experimental process. \n \n In the first part of the experiment, ten samples are taken from a large bacterial population suspended in liquid and seperately cultured on phage plates. The number of survivors in each sample are observed to be very similar. So far, the data is consistent with either Darwinian random mutation occuring prior to phage exposure or Lamarckian 'induced mutation'.\n \n In the second part, twenty very small samples are taken from the large bacterial population and cultured seperately for a time until their populations approximate those of the samples in the first part of the experiment. The whole of each of these cultures is then transferred to phage plates. However, despite being of similar size to the samples used in the first part of the experiment, the pattern of survival is markedly different. Eleven of the plates show no growth at all, and a total of seventeen show six or fewer survivors. One shows 35, one 64 and one 107.\n \n It is the discrepancy in the variance of the observed results from the first and second parts of the experiment that indicates Darwinian rather than Lamarckian adaptation. Any variation in the number of survivors induced by the physical process of plating the samples (such as your 'lumpiness') would be observed in both parts of the experiment, since they were plated using the same technique. \n \n Hence my earlier statement that there is no reason to suppose that some sample cultures were inherently more adaptable than others: the control samples taken from the large population and immediately exposed to phage indicated that this was not the case. Lamarckism has no explanation to offer for the latter set of samples faring usually far worse but occasionally far better than the former set. Only mutation occurring at random times (or not at all) in the culturing of the tiny samples prior to plating can account for these observations.\n \n This 'fluctuation test' experiment has been repeated countless times and forms a staple part of university-level biological education. If the original results were freakishly unrepresentative, this would long ago have become apparent.\n \n \nI don't know what you are refering to, here. I've already adressed your \"you may find\" links, so please give a post number to these other links.\n\n \n You didn't address them at all; you didn't even read the abstract of the first one. You claimed earlier that adaptive mutations don't arise in a stable environment; the first link contradicts this emphatically, as does the last, where three successive adaptive mutations are observed in a yeast culture in a stable environment (occurring in randomly different orders when the experiment is repeated, before you try to claim that each successive mutation was a response to the environment created by the last).\n \n \nForget about it. You're no better than those other jerks. Try this XXXX on somebody else.\n\n \n I hardly think that's called for. I explained earlier that NS was a feedback system, not a tautology, and that your criticism of it was linguistic rather than scientific. You responded by denying ever referring to NS as a tautology, and then turned right around and criticised SOTF - another layman's term for the same feedback process - for being tautological instead! What do you want me to say in response to that sort of mealy-mouthed evasion?\n \n Fine, if you insist; I'll repeat my argument: SOTF is a feedback process, not a tautology. Audo feedback arises as a result of a process that can also be described tautologically: \"What is amplified, is amplified.\" Unless you can show that this violation of your semantic sensibilities proves that audio feedback cannot occur, I see no reason to accept your linguistic criticism of hundred-year-old layman's terms for the Modern Synthesis as evidence that it must be false.",

The additional cultures mentioned were simply grown in different media, presumably to exclude the possibility of other unintended influences corrupting the result.

In short, nothing but verbal nonsense.\n \n Pretending that these two verbalisms denote, or even connote, 'the same thing', or that they have any real meaning beyond the tautology's vacuous truism, is the only \"cheap verbal chicanery\" going on around here.\n \n As for Luria/Delbruck, every time I debate it's significance my opponent offers a different set of protocols. The original paper wastes no time on making them clear and explicit, and so I just go along with however my opponent, (who usually claims to be a qualified geneticist), lays them out for me. Idebated at least three different sets of protocols, and the one I gave was my recollection of the last one I was given.\n \n You are correct in stipulating that the reason for doing the experiment was to demonstrate to the world that 'adaptation' occurred as per the newly invented (at that time), \"Modern Synthesis\", that is, that it was the effect/outcome of a 'genetic mutation', a 'causal' event that occurred prior to and disconnected from any organismic need for its effect. As opposed to the lamarckian view that 'adaptation' occurred as a direct and immediate response to a proximate, specific, and local environmental stimulus/cause. In this case, e.coli. vs streptomycin. My bad. I simply cannot trust my memory about anything, anymore.\n \n Since I suppose that we cannot proceed until we have argued that the merits of this experiment, which, with its various copies and clones and variations is the fundamental experimental evidence for \"The Modern Synthesis\" hypothesis. I maintain that, no matter what the actual empirical protocols employed in the original experiment or its later facsimiles, its conclusions are based upomn a logical fallacy. That fallacy being that if A appears to have caused C, then it did cause C. This being based upon the assumption that if there are only two mutually exclusive possibilities, and the outcome resembles the expected outcome of the one and but is dissimilar to the expected outcome of the other, then the latter is excluded by default. The only problem with this is that in this case there were three, not two, mutually exclusive outcomes. As mechanists, L&D admitted only of physical causal mechanisms, which could only be accidental (random and prior wrt effect, i.e., genetic mechanical failure), or mechanical (contemporaneous with a mechanical, chemical reaction). They could not and did not admit of a third option, that is, of a psychical, motivational causal factor operating out of either past experience or immediate stimulus, one that varied in strength and efficacy in such a way that it ruled out mechanical uniformity but not accidental irregularity.\n \n IAC, re L&D, some questions that I can't find answers for in the paper.\n \n A/ What steps were taken to insure that the normal resistance had been totally excised from the bacteria culture used as the starting batch for the experiment?\n \n B/ Why were all batches kept to the smallest quantities (smallest colonies with fewest reproductive events) possible?\n \n C/ Just exactly what particular physical (non-mathematical) procedures were performed upon the bacteria, from the very start to the last count, and where are they mentioned explicitly in the paper?\n \n I know I'm being presumptuous, but since I'm not a scientist, let alone a microbiologist or a statistician, (not even an accountant or book-keeper), and having confused myself about this once already, I must rely upon you to point out the facts of the case for me, if you would be so kind?\n \n And no more disparaging remarks about me personally, directly or obliquely.

First, even if one of the tiny number of cells they took did, by some 10,000,000-1 chance, happen to already carry the mutation, all that would happen is that that culture would exhibit a massive survival rate later on, adding further weight to the evidence in support of Darwinism.\n \n \nB/ Why were all batches kept to the smallest quantities (smallest colonies with fewest reproductive events) possible?\n\n \n Primarily, so far as I can see, to allow the entirety of the 'bottlenecked' colonies to be plated. Bear in mind that both the initial ten samples from the large culture and the colonies grown from the twenty tiny samples consisted of roughly the same number of bacteria at the time they were exposed to the phage.\n \n \nC/ Just exactly what particular physical (non-mathematical) procedures were performed upon the bacteria, from the very start to the last count, and where are they mentioned explicitly in the paper?\n\n \n As I recall, they are described as occurring in 'the standard manner'. I don't claim to know what that is, but it's clearly nothing any biologist on either side of the argument could take exception to. Besides, the experiment has been repeated, based solely on the contents of that paper, literally millions of times with different bacteria and materials, always with the same statistical results, so one has to assume their methodology did not employ any exotic processes other biologists would be unfamiliar with or object to.[/QUOTE]",

NS is a cumulative process of statistical influence; it's a feedback loop. \n \n If you're trying to say that the reason we see more of a given trait in each successive generation is not that it was inherited from more successful breeders who themselves had that trait, but rather that over time more and more of a population seperately induce the same genetic change within themselves... well, I think I'd like to see some evidence for that.",

   "Is audio feedback a cause or an effect? Pick one you're happy with, and let's move on. Or do you intend forever to ignore the analogy?\n\n \n **\n Audio feedback is an empirically discernible mechanical phenomenon. \"NS\" is not. The analogy is false, ergo, ignorable, for exactly the same reason that Darwin's analogy with artificial selection, i.e., stock-breeding was false and should have been dismissed as forced. That is, audio feedback is a mechanical accident in an artificial system, whereas \"NS\" supposedly involves living things and natural processes.\n But even in mechanical or informational terms, \"feedback\" is always an effect.\n It is always something prompted, initiated, or caused by something else. A 'feedback loop' is the phenomenon that occurs that when a portion of a productive systems output is caused to return to the system, and is there used to either increase or decrease, that is, regulate, further productive output.\n In some mechanical systems, such as your audio feedback loop, it occurs accidentally, and instead of the above, it is,-- \n \n \"Sound[noise] created[caused] when a transducer such as a microphone or electric guitar picks up sound [music] from a speaker connected to an amplifier and regenerates it back through the amplifier[as distorted sounds, noise].\" \n \n [asides mine, citations here and below from answers.com]\n \n Clearly this is a negative effect caused by an accident, sort of like birth defects caused by entropic genetic mutations or developmental screw-ups in embryoes. Is that what you mean by \"Natural Selection\"?!?\n \n Compare that to,--\n \"The return of information about the result of a process or activity; an evaluative response: eg., asked the students for feedback on the new curriculum.\",\n a case in which informational [intelligent] 'feedback loops' are used to control , regulate, and direct teleologically directed production. But that can't be \"NS\", because neither \"NS\", nor your concept of evolution, is an intelligent [i.e.,autopoietic] system, is it?\n \n How about,--\n \n \"The process by which a system, often biological or ecological, is modulated, controlled, or changed by the product, output, or response it produces.\" \n \n That could be what you're aiming at, since covers every possible effect, from teleological efficiency to entropic 'noise'.\n \n I've never given non-intelligent, non-intentional, non-productive, mechanically accidental and entropic feedback loops, like speaker feedback, any thought before, and since that seems to be what you are claiming for your \"NS\", let's take a look at them.\n \n First, --\n \"In nature--Bipolar feedback is present in many natural and human systems. Feedback is sually bipolar-that is, positive and negative-in natural environments which, in their diversity, furnish synergic and antagonistic responses to the output of any system[2].\" \n \n \"In biological systems such as organisms, ecosystems, or the biosphere, most parameters must stay under control within a narrow range around a certain optimal level under certain environmental conditions. The deviation of the optimal value of the controlled parameter can result from the changes in internal and external environments. A change of some of the environmental conditions may also require change of that range to change for the system to function. The value of the parameter to maintain is recorded by a reception system and conveyed to a regulation module via an information channel.\"\n \n **\n NOTE --We're back to an intelligent, regulatory information feedback loop. But that can't be \"NS\", because this 'feedback loop' requires a regulator working teleologically towards achieving a goal for its system, i.e., an optimum set of environmental conditions, sometimes known as 'ecological balance', or even, 'good health'.\n \n \n Continuation--\n Second-- \n \"Biological systems contain many types of regulatory circuits, among which positive and negative feedbacks. Positive and negative don't imply consequences of the feedback have positive or negative final effect. The negative feedback loop tends to slow down a process, while the positive feedback loop tends to accelerate it.\n \n Feedback and regulation are self related. The negative feedback helps to maintain stability in a system in spite of external changes. It is related to homeostasis. Positive feedback amplifies possibilities of divergences (evolution, change of goals); it is the condition to change, evolution, growth; it gives the system the ability to access new points of equilibrium.\" \n \n **\n [Note the link here between 'goals', (i.e., 'teleology'), and 'evolution'.]\n \n Continuation--\n \"For example, in an organism, most positive feedbacks provide for fast autoexcitation of elements of endocrine and nervous systems (in particular, in stress responses conditions) and play a key role in regulation of morphogenesis, growth, and development of organs, all processes which are in essence a rapid escape from the initial state. Homeostasis is especially visible in the nervous and endocrine systems when considered at organism level.\"\n \n **\n Homeostasis is impossible without optimums (i.e., \"value systems\"), intentional behaviour, inter-cellular information relays, (feedback loops) and an information processor, either cellular or organismic. We call that, 'intelligence'. What do you call it? I hope we're no back to, 'adaptability'. :(\n \n Continuation--\n \"Feedback is also central to the operations of genes and gene regulatory networks. repressor (see Lac repressor) and activator proteins are used to create genetic operons, which were identified by Francois Jacob and Jacques Monod in 1961 as feedback loops.\"\n \n **\n Note- all internal regulator controls, including 'repressors', are feedback mechanisms serving the goals of some greater system, such as the organism itself. As in regulating respiration, perspiration, heartbeat and metabolism in general, including such developmental operations as genetic expression and repression through the analysis of information fed back to--what? A brain that has not yet developed? Or the developing organism as a whole intelligent system in itself?\n \n Continuation--\n \"Any self-regulating natural process [autopoietic system] involves feedback and is prone to hunting. [\"hunting\"--\"oscillation of output resulting from improperly tuned inputs of first positive then negative feedback. Audio feedback typifies this form of oscillation.\"--answers.com].\"\n \n I think that that is true, in the sense that any heuristic goal-seeking teleological process, such as my Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis, uses intelligent evaluation of feedback information to narrow search space possibilities on a 'positive/negative', 'warmer/colder' (blindman's buff) style process. \"Hunting\" is an execellent word for that heuristic search process in systems that employ it intentionally as an intelligent information evaluating process.\n Unfortunately for \"NS\", it has neither intelligence nor anything 'optimal' to heuristically search for and achieve, being non-directional and disinterested. So the best 'hunting' can relate to \"NS\" is the accidental 'hunting' caused in audio feedback, the kind that destroys music production and creates nothing but noise.\n \n Continuation--\n \"A well known example in ecology is the oscillation of the population of snowshoe hares due to predation from lynxes.\"\n \n **\n Oooops!! They are mistaken here. The population of hares is not a function of the predation of lynxes. The population of lynxes is a function of the population of hares. Snowshoe hares, like many rodents, are dedicated Darwinists. That is, for them \"fitness\" means highly positive reproduction numbers, originating in the fact that everything with fangs or talons eats them, and it's only extreme fecundity that keeps them going. Unlike other organisms, (say coyotes), rodents do not adjust reproduction to suit the food supply, and so, without adequate predation, soon eat themselves out of house and home (see australian rabbits, rats on deserted islands, etc.)\n In Canada' northern boreal forest, where they and the Canada lynx coexist, there is a shortage of predators and a shortage of edible fodder, leading to the hares' overpopulation and ensuing mass starvation and/or disease, which in a single winter can cause the hare population to plummet to nearly nothing. It has nothing to do with the lynxes' predation, or shortage of it. The entire boreal ecosystem is prone to 'hunting', in the mechanical sense of audio 'hunting', and these population crashes are simply its version of 'noise'. The population destruction of lynxes follows from the population destruction of hares, since hares comprise at least the largest part of their summer diet, and all of their winter diet.\n The effect of the disonant feedback loop mechanically derived by the northern boreal system on the hares has the same negative impact on the lynxes that mechanical, mindless audio feedback has on our ears. Except that audio feedback doesn't usually get us killed. If that is your \"NS\", say so.\n \n Continuation--\n \"In zymology, feedback serves as regulation of activity of an enzyme by its direct product(s) or downstream metabolite(s) in the metabolic pathway (see Allosteric regulation).\"\n \n **\n I shall not comment as I have no understanding of the procees they are referring to.\n \n Continuation--\n \"There is an ice-albedo positive feedback loop whereby melting snow exposes more dark ground (of lower albedo), which in turn absorbs heat and causes more snow to melt. This is part of the evidence of the danger of global warming.\"\n \n **\n Another example of the destructive 'noise' (effect) created (_caused_ by) unintentional, unintelligent, mechanical 'feedback loops'.\n \n Now back to your post.\n \n \n\n The first self-replicating organism - of which I presume you agree there was one - is the first cause,\n\n \n **\n Please don't be deliberately obtuse. The first self-replicating organism was the effect of whatever engendered it. What was that causal agency? Or did all the complexity of autopoietic biosystems just spontaneously generate itself?\n \n \n\n like the first sound entering a microphone.\n\n \n ** \n Who made that first sound? Was it the guitarist, the vocalist, or the sound tekkie?\n \n \n\n NS is a feedback effect that has continued ever since. Is feedback 'mindless verbal garbage' too?\n\n \n **\n As above, no, not when it's part of an intentional, intelligent, goal-seeking system. But when its mindless, random or uncontrolled mechanically, 'garbage' or 'noise' is all it produces. Sounds like \"NS\" to me, alright. :)\n \n \n\n Quote:\n My \"logical construction\", or deconstruction, of \"natural selection\" is the one I've just finished outlining.

As for your request \"re. the validity of feedback as an analogy\", I've actually taken the time and energy to thoroughly explore that point for you.

   "To your credit, you have done a very thorough job of investigating all the different meanings and uses of the word 'feedback'. Unfortunately the reasoning applied to this information is flawed in several respects.\n \n Touching first upon your critique of 'audio feedback' as an analogy, your initial dismissal is based on circular logic: biological systems require a qualitative difference to explain their behaviour, and because they are qualitatively different, non-intelligent, statistical or mechanical analogies that might otherwise help explain their behaviour don't apply.\n \n Next, you describe audio feedback as 'entropic' and 'destructive'. Arguably false even when applied to music, your more important oversight is that feedback can generate tones out of white noise. It is not, therefore, inherently entropic.\n \n Rather than equate 'music' with 'correctly functioning organisms' and 'feedback wail' with 'broken organisms' in this analogy, one should equate the repeatedly amplified constant note as a 'successfully reproducing organism', and white noise as the randomly varied gene-pool from which the amplified note is 'selected'.\n \n NS is eminently successful at feeding back (retaining and amplifying) a particular quality: differential reproductive success. Nobody put NS in place; it's an inevitable consequence of variation and competition for resources. Nobody asked it to achieve a particular effect, or set a goal. Like audio feedback it just happens to create a particular effect. You are perfectly free to say that filtering for reproductive success is good or bad, beneficial or entropic, but you cannot logically deny that finite resources and mutation do filter for reproductive success.\n \n You continue in the same vein, exploring some other uses of the word 'feedback', and disqualifying NS as a 'hunting' system because it is non-intelligent and undirected - which of course it is. But 'undirected' does not mean 'directionless'. Reproductive success is a clear differential axis, and genetic variation a clear inducer of 'hunting' behaviour in a system. Neither require intelligent goal-setting.\n \n \nPlease don't be deliberately obtuse. The first self-replicating organism was the effect of whatever engendered it. What was that causal agency? Or did all the complexity of autopoietic biosystems just spontaneously generate itself?\n\n \n Please don't deliberately obfuscate. NS influences populations of biological organisms. It is not, and has never claimed to be, an explanation for the existence of living organisms. The process of NS began with the first self-replicating organism. How that came about is outside the scope of a discussion about NS. As you've already admitted, Vitalism offers no explanation here either.\n \n \nAnother example of the destructive 'noise' (effect) created (_caused_ by) unintentional, unintelligent, mechanical 'feedback loops'.\n\n \n Again, I could just as easily claim that feedback process (snowmelt) to be successful, not destructive. If you, an intelligent agent, were trying to expose some ground to grow crops, you'd certainly describe it as one.\n \n \nWho made that first sound? Was it the guitarist, the vocalist, or the sound tekkie?\n\n \n Maybe it was snow falling from a feedback-warmed patch of cliff-face ;)\n \n \nAs above, no, not when it's part of an intentional, intelligent, goal-seeking system. But when its mindless, random or uncontrolled mechanically, 'garbage' or 'noise' is all it produces.\n\n \n Again, circular logic. Every time you see a feedback loop producing something that could be characterised as a beneficial effect, you either insist it must be intelligently driven, or colour your assessment of what it achieves as 'destructive'. And NS is not 'random'; the whole point is that beneficial traits will tend - quickly or slowly - to crowd out those that are less beneficial, purely through differential reproductive success.\n \n \nThe effect of the disonant feedback loop mechanically derived by the northern boreal system on the hares has the same negative impact on the lynxes that mechanical, mindless audio feedback has on our ears. Except that audio feedback doesn't usually get us killed. If that is your \"NS\", say so.\n\n \n I'm not sure what you mean by 'that' being NS. Is natural selection occurring in that situation? Of course; it inevitably happens everywhere there is genetic variation and competition for resources. Is Natural Selection represented by the 'noisy' oscillations of the hare population? No; you're fudging concepts together from all over the place.\n \n NOTE: For this next section, I'm going to do my level best to avoid implying intent, goals, or directedness - if I slip up, please take it as read that such an implication was not my intention.\n \n Fecundity is, as you say, a successful (note: not good, not clever, not intelligent - just successful) trait in a heavily-predated environment. Successful, that is, in terms of the continuation of the genes that inspire that fecundity. There might of course be alternative successful traits, but it's likely that fecundity represents a 'local maximum' in that environment.\n \n When emerging from a population crash, with resources all around and few predators (those having also starved or failed to breed thanks to the lack of hares), the tendency to fecundity will also result in the genes that inspire that trait being present in a larger proportion of each successive and more numerous generation. So far, fecundity succeeds quite a lot of the time.\n \n The apparent problem comes when resources are exhausted and overpopulation leads to starvation. Most hares die out. Surely fecundity has failed? No. Success in NS doesn't mean 'hares not dying' or even necessarily 'population increasing'. Population increasing or population decreasing, 'success' for an alelle is representation within the gene pool. So when the population does crash, of those that survive, most are carrying the fecundity trait, because most of the breeding takes place in times of plenty. And that fecundity will be a successful trait the next time resources become plentiful.\n \n In conclusion, then, while scarcity of food can (and likely does) make fecundity a temporarily disadvantageous trait, the cyclical return of times of plenty, and times of heavy predation, when fecundity is very successful, keeps the genetic tendency to fecundity prevalent within the gene pool.\n \n Now, an intelligent evolutionary system focused on the needs of the organism or the 'greater good' would never come up with or allow this boom/crash nightmare where thousands of organisms starve painfully to death, possibly to the point of extinction. It only makes sense in the absence of intelligence, when considered on the level of variant alelles. Genes aren't intelligent; they can't know or care that they're part of an organism. They aren't even trying to replicate themselves, or compete with other variants. It's simply the case that some variants induce traits that are more successful than others at reproducing the genome - a feedback loop. Blindly, mindlessly, unintentionally, alelles that induce traits empirically beneficial to the reproduction of the genome will inevitably tend to dominate - whatever the cost in dead hares.",

   "\n To your credit, you have done a very thorough job of investigating all the different meanings and uses of the word 'feedback'.\n\n \n **\n Gee, thanks. I do so enjoy being patronised by people who assume themselves to be older, wiser, better educated, or otherwise superior to lil ol' me.\n \n \n\n Unfortunately the reasoning applied to this information is flawed in several respects.\n\n \n **\n You think? We'll have to just see about whose reasoning is flawed, and whose is not, won't we?\n \n \n\n Touching first upon your critique of 'audio feedback' as an analogy, your initial dismissal is based on circular logic: biological systems require a qualitative difference to explain their behaviour, and because they are qualitatively different, non-intelligent, statistical or mechanical analogies that might otherwise help explain their behaviour don't apply.\n\n \n **\n Let me refresh your memory. Analogies are literary, and sometimes pedagogical, devices, whereby attention is drawn to a shared quality in two or more otherwise different entities. They can be similes, metaphors, tropes, conceits, parables, and whatnot. A true analogy is when attention is drawn to the fact that entity 'A' shares a particular quality, property, trait, with entity 'B', even though they have next to nothing else in common. Burns line, \"My love is like a red, red rose\" is a common example, a human being and a plant sharing the common quality of being beautiful and aesthetically pleasing to the speaker.\n The utility of analogies is that, although the listener does not have personal experience of the one entity (say Robbie's current flame), he/she does have a shared experiences of, say, roses, and so can transfer his understanding of the quality of beauty in roses to this lady, without ever getting to clap eyes on her. That is what analogies are all about.\n \n A 'false' analogy is when a quality, property, trait, whatever, one that is clearly possessed by and identified with \"A\", is asserted or implied or imputed to \"B\", which in fact simply does not possess it. It's a falsehood, a lie, and a deliberate one at that. Such as \"The wicked witch of the west is like a cold beer on a hot day.\" Or, \"Natural Selection\" is like human selection.\n \n Coming, finally, to your analogy of audio feedback to human selectivity, you claim that my logic is 'circular', i.e., 'begs the question', by placing my conclusion in my premises. We shall see.\n \n First of all, if you want to make the analogy a comparison of the noise generated by a mechanical accident in a sound system with your \"Natural Selection\", go ahead. I can't think of any shared quality that does your \"NS\" any credit. Noise is just noise, after all. From answer.com--\n \n \"noise\"\n \"Physics. A disturbance, especially a random and persistent disturbance, that obscures or reduces the clarity of a signal.\n Computer Science. Irrelevant or meaningless data.\"\n \n Sounds like a quality possessed by \"NS\", sure enough!!\n \n As for my reasoning wrt your assertion that 'NS' is a true analogy with human intelligent and volitional selection because you suppose \"NS\" to be a true analogy with 'audio [mechanical, accidental] feedback loops' , it falls down unless you can demonstrate that mechanical and accidental, (i.e., entropic) feedback loops are a true analogy [posssess the same defining property] re human intentional and intelligent selection. By definition they do not. Accidents and mechanical systems do not possess the intelligence, volition, and goals that direct the behaviour, 'selection, choice', that distinguish autopoietic systems as organisms from random accidents in mechanically determined machine systems, such as audio feedback loops.\n So, my reasoning goes--\n \n A/\"NS\" and \"audio feedback\" are true analogies because they share the same property-- senseless, obscurant, disturbing, fuzzy, nebulous and unpleasant noise. [as defined above]\n \n B/The analogy of audio feedback with human selection is false because audio feedback has nothing in common with intelligent, volitional, intentional, goal-seeking and productive human selection, because audio feedback is mechanical and accidental and non-directional and interferes with the system's intended productivity, i.e., its intended functioning.\n \n C/Therefore, since \"NS\" and 'audio feedback' share the same essential defining quality, but 'audio feedback' does not share that quality with 'human selection', then \"NS\" does not share that quality with 'human selection', and any analogy drawn between the two is therefore false.\n \n \n\n Next, you describe audio feedback as 'entropic' and 'destructive'. Arguably false even when applied to music,\n\n \n **\n You think so? Well, argue it then. But preferably in some other thread.\n \n \n\n your more important oversight is that feedback can generate tones out of white noise. It is not, therefore, inherently entropic.\n\n \n **\n White noise is inherently entropic, so I suppose that if you disturb that state with any kind of causal input (force, energy, whatever) you might generate something non-entropic. Life on earth, even!:). \n As to your assertion that the 'noise' of audio feedback can generate tones, i.e., \"A sound of distinct pitch, quality, and duration; a note.\" out of whitenoise, I'll just have to take your word for it, which is no problem for me, as it is altogether irrelevent to the point under discussion.\n \n \n\n Rather than equate 'music' with 'correctly functioning organisms' and 'feedback wail' with 'broken organisms', one should equate the repeatedly amplified constant note as a 'successfully reproducing organism', and white noise as the randomly varied gene-pool from which the amplified note is 'selected'.\n\n \n **\n How about we equate \"the repeatedly amplified constant note\" to an expanding balloon of argumentation and rationalization, one nearing the explosion of 'reductio ad absurdum', and equate the 'white noise' to the hot air used to puff it up? \n \n \n\n NS is eminently successful at feeding back (retaining and amplifying) a particular quality: reproductive success.\n\n \n **\n Sez u. Talk about 'circular reasoning'!!\n \n \n \n\n Nobody put NS in place; it's an inevitable consequence of variation and competition for resources.\n\n \n **\n What is? \"NS\"? So are you admitting that \"NS\" is only an after effect of, not a mechanism for, evolution? BTW, 'variation' is also an effect caused by something other than itself. And 'competition' is another property that requires intention and motivation and deliberate action. 'Unintentional competition' is, IMO, an oxymoron.\n \n Anyhow, your statement is purely metaphysical, an unsupported and empirically unsupportable statement of opinion.\n \n \n\n Nobody asked it to achieve a particular effect, or set a goal.\n\n \n **\n That would have been like asking 'god', wouldn't it?\n \n \n\n Like audio feedback it just happens to create a particular effect.\n\n \n **\n Yeah. As already explainrd, it just happens to create the exact same effect, even. As I've said a million times, \"It just happens, that's all.\", is no substitute for science.\n \n \n \n\n You are perfectly free to say that filtering for reproductive success is good or bad, beneficial or entropic, but you cannot logically deny that NS does filter for reproductive success.\n\n \n **\n How can I make value judgements about the hypothetical behaviour of something that has not yet been shown to be anything more real than an angel or an elf? Anyone can assert that hobbits have big hairy feet, and I won't argue the point. I will argue against hobbits being real, that is, actual, in any non-fanciful sense. And the same still goes for your, \"Natural Selection\".\n \n \n\n You continue in the same vein, exploring some uses of the word 'feedback' never intended to be analogous to NS, \n\n \n **\n What did you bring it up for, then? You knew at the start that any intelligent, informational, teleological sense of the word 'feedback' could never be applied to \"NS\". Didn't you?\n \n \n \n\n and disqualifying NS as a 'hunting' system because it non-intelligent and undirected - which of course it is. But 'undirected' does not mean 'directionless'. Reproductive success is a clear differential axis, and genetic variation a clear inducer of 'hunting' behaviour in a system.\n\n \n **\n No. it's not!! First, explain how \"reproductive success\", (by which I assume you mean your definition of 'fitness', (i.e., 'positive differential reproductive success compared with other organisms of the same kind in the same place at the same time' ) is \"a clear differential axis\", and just why that should be taken to actually mean something.\n Second, you are once again committing the sin of attributing causal agency to a simple fact, (i.e., variation, different possible choices available), as inducing/generating the action of selecting among them! The only sensible manner in which that could been seen as occuring is through motivation and values, that is, through intelligence and volition.\n You can set out a long wash of many different clothes on the line, [i.e., simple variation], leave it while clouds gather, and believe me, no raindrop will be \"induced\" to fall on any particular article of clothing, or any clothing at all, simply because your clothesline has such a wide variety of clothes on it. Even if you exclaim, \"It only rained because I had just put out a fresh load of wash!!\", as some good ladies have been heard to say, it won't be scientifically true.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Please don't be deliberately obtuse. The first self-replicating organism was the effect of whatever engendered it. What was that causal agency? Or did all the complexity of autopoietic biosystems just spontaneously generate itself? \n \n \n Please don't deliberately obfuscate.

As I pointed out earlier in this thread, any hypothesis that seeks to present a mechanism for the alteration of life forms over time should, rationally, be able to account, at least partially, for the presence of lifeforms in the first place. Otherwise it is simply incoherent.\n EAM is coherent because it posits an additional force, Vitality, to both the genesis of lifeforms and their alteration over time. \"NS\" does neither the one nor the other. It is a vacuous, meaningless verbalism, a false analogy to something real, and that is all it ever will be.\n \n \n \n\n The process of NS began with the first self-replicating organism. How that came about is outside the scope of a discussion about NS. As you've already admitted, Vitalism offers no explanation here either.\n\n \n **\n Hold on. I said that Vitality did not connect the missing dots, i.e., explain the mechanical details of genesis. That much is true. But simply by postulating the action of another force, i.e., my Neo-vitalist, Dynamist force, \"Vitality\", raises genesis on earth above the level of the \"spontaneous generation\", \"abiogenesis\" magic entailed in the materialist/mechanist hypothethesis.\n In so doing I've provided a partial explanation in scientific terms, while you people have done no better, (and no differently,if the truth were told), than the creationists.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Another example of the destructive 'noise' (effect) created (_caused_ by) unintentional, unintelligent, mechanical 'feedback loops'. \n \n \n Again, I could just as easily claim that feedback process (snowmelt) to be successful, not destructive.\n\n \n **\n True, since values are purely relative. \"Des gouts et des couleurs, on ne discute pas.\", comme disent les francais. ( Hope I got that right. If not, my apologies to you francophones:) . All a matter of taste. Such as calling modern atonal noise, 'music'.\n \n \n \n\n If you, an intelligent agent, were trying to expose some ground to grow crops, you'd certainly describe it as one.\n\n \n \n **\n Yep. Values are entirely a matter of intelligent choice founded upon the goals of the selector.\n \n \n [quote]\n Quote:\n As above, no, not when it's part of an intentional, intelligent, goal-seeking system. But when its mindless, random or uncontrolled mechanically, 'garbage' or 'noise' is all it produces. \n \n \n\n Again, circular logic. Every time you see a feedback loop producing something that could be characterised as a beneficial effect, you either insist it must be intelligently driven, or colour your assessment of what it achieves as 'destructive'.\n\n \n **\n Not so. Yes, a feedback loop that is intelligent, i.e., that is intelligently designed and built, will have a 'beneficial', i.e., productive result, at least from the designer's/builder's/operator's POV. BUT, I do not say that all destructive events are unintentional and unintelligent. What I do say is that in any interdependent, productive system with particular aims and goals, (be they internally or externally invested), accidental changes to its operation are unproductive; destructive, even.\n \n I make my judgements of outcomes in terms of inferred goals, ie., intentions. With living things, I infer the internal goals--Survive, Thrive, and Reproduce. With audio systems I infer the externally imposed goal, 'amplify the music that is intended to be amplified'. In both cases, internal and external induction, there are empirically inferable intentional goals, that is, entailed intelligence and volition, and the failure to achieve those goals indicates a malfunctioning or 'broken' feedback apparatus. And that is generally considered to be 'a bad thing'; i.e., a destructive rather than constructive, negative rather than positive, thing.\n \n \n\n And NS is not 'random';\n\n \n **\n Sez u. But then, you can say anything you like about it, since you can't even show us that it is anything more than an ephemeral fantasy, to begin with.\n \n \n\n the whole point is that beneficial traits will tend - quickly or slowly - to crowd out those that are less beneficial, purely through differential reproductive success.\n\n \n **\n More circular, 'begging the question', tautological thinking.\n \n \n\n Thank you for exploring feedback so thoroughly. I'd particularly appreciate your thoughts re. the ability of audio feedback to produce pure tones out of white noise - a non-entropic process that 'selects' those tones best able to 'survive their environment' (ie, pass through the equipment undistorted).\n\n \n **\n See my thoughts on that, above.",

   "**\n \n I see that peeling edited and re-wrote the last half of his most recent post while I was writing my posted response to his origina version, above. So, to pass the time, I thought I'd go back and respond to whatever unexamined parts of his posts that are still outstanding. Starting with this revised edition. \n \n \n \n Quote:\n \"The effect of the disonant feedback loop mechanically derived by the northern boreal system on the hares has the same negative impact on the lynxes that mechanical, mindless audio feedback has on our ears. Except that audio feedback doesn't usually get us killed. If that is your \"NS\", say so. \" \n \n \n I'm not sure what you mean by 'that' being NS.\n\n \n **\n I did not say \"that\" NS actually was \"noise\" generated in a mechanical feedback loop with no or poor oscillation control--I simply asked that you confirm or deny whether or not that characterization matched your understanding of what \"NS\" means. \n \n [quote]\n Is natural selection occurring in that situation? Of course; it inevitably happens everywhere there is genetic variation and competition for resources.[quote]\n \n **\n There is mostly trivial and inconsequential (you people say \"neutral\") genetic variation among organisms of different taxons, and in the same species, and in the same population, and even in the same family, brood, whatever. The notion of \"competition\" for resources is not universal phenomenon in nature. The notion that any shared resource is 'competed for' by organisms who are simply living their lives is way to anthropomorphic for me. By that reasoning the blood in my body is 'competed for' by my skin, brain, lungs, liver, and so forth. I don't buy it.\n \n In the hare/lynx example it is for certain that the hares are not 'competing' with the lynxes for resources. In my opinion the hares are not competing with the hares, nor the lynxes with the lynxes, either--they are each separately and disinterestedly, regardless of what anything else is doing, trying to put enough food in their respective bellies to keep themselves alive. It's not a hotdog-eating contest.\n \n As to whether there is any \"NS\" happening in this case or not, I wouldn't know, since there is as yet no clear understanding of just what \"NS\" is supposed to be. Let's establish it's empirical reality before moving on to its supposedly self-evident inevitability.\n \n \n\n Is Natural Selection represented by the 'noisy' oscillations of the hare population? No; you're fudging concepts together from all over the place.\n\n \n \n **\n I'm not the one \"fudging concepts together from all over the place\". You're the one who introduced a linkage between audio feedback loops and \"NS\".\n \n \n [quote]\n The apparent problem comes when resources are exhausted and overpopulation leads to starvation. Most hares die out. Surely fecundity has failed? No.[quote]\n \n [quote]\n \n No?!?! A strategy that leads to an inevitable disaster is a failed strategy, if you ask me. Like in Iraq, for example.\n \n \n\n Success in NS doesn't mean 'hares not dying' or even necessarily 'population increasing'.\n\n \n **\n What _does_ \"NS\" mean?\n \n \n\n Population increasing or population decreasing, 'success' for an alelle is representation within the gene pool.\n\n \n **\n That may make for some pleased and proud little alleles, but it doesn't say anything about the nature of \"NS\".\n \n \n \n\n So when the population does crash, of those that survive, most are carrying the fecundity trait, because most of the breeding takes place in times of plenty.\n\n \n **\n Actually, barring genetic mutation or a developmental mistake, all survivors should carry the 'fecundity trait', because it's a defining characteristic of hares. They don't say 'breed like rabbits' for nothing, you know.\n \n \n\n And that fecundity will be a successful trait the next time resources become plentiful.\n\n \n **\n Actually, it won't, since it will lead inevitably to another general catastrophe.\n \n \n\n In conclusion, then, while scarcity of food can (and likely does) make fecundity a temporarily disadvantageous trait, the cyclical return of times of plenty, and times of heavy predation, when fecundity is very successful, keeps the genetic tendency to fecundity prevalent within the gene pool.\n\n \n \n **\n Disagree, but more to the point, where's the \"selection\" in all this?\n \n \n\n Now, an intelligent evolutionary system focused on the needs of the organism or the 'greater good' would never come up with or allow this boom/crash nightmare where thousands of organisms starve painfully to death, possibly to the point of extinction.\n\n \n **\n If, as I believe, the tree principle goals of lifeforms ar survive, thrive, and reproduce, then they seem to be succeeding over the long term. I mean, they've been doing this for 10,000 years, and they're still as many of them in the north as there ever were. Lynxes, not so much, for various reasons.\n \n \n\n It's simply the case that some variants induce traits that are more successful than others at reproducing the genome - a feedback loop.\n\n \n **\n What 'variant' are you referring to in the case of the hare? They all seem pretty much the same to me, and whether one does not starve or gets eaten by a lynx is more to do with 'luck' than any special gene.\n \n \n \n\n Blindly, mindlessly, unintentionally, alelles that induce traits empirically beneficial to the reproduction of the genome will inevitably tend to dominate - whatever the cost in dead hares.\n\n \n \n **\n Again, what allele (in the case of the hares), are you talking about? \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

   "**\n Finishing another post, this being peeling #112.\n \n \n\n By all means, be as pedantic as you like about the use of the word 'selection', but don't project your pedantry onto those for whom 'Natural Selection' is merely the illustrative analogy it was intended to be, and then accuse them of making claims in that context. \n\n \n **\n First of all, insisting upon the honest and true usage of a word in its proper sense is NOT pedantry. Insisting upon using a word in a false sense, in order to draw a false analogy, in order to make a false claim palatable and plausible in the ears of the general public, in order to self-servingly promote and proselytise one's own personal metaphysical postulate, (i.e., to evangelise atheistic materialism), is an intellectual shyster's con game. \n \n \n \n\n While you're at it, why don't you go and blow a fuse at those talking about the 'global warming' that might in fact trigger an ice age,\n\n \n \n **\n Why in heaven's name would I debate something that is empirically inarguable?!?! Who is it that you mistake me for?\n \n \n \n\n or the 'blind watchmaker' that clearly constructs no timepieces?\n\n \n **\n OTH, Dawkins' \"Blind Watchmaker\" is just another false analogy used in place of Darwin's \"NS\", but referring to the same imaginary entity. Call it, \"The B.M\", or call it, \"N.S.\", it's still only \"B.S.\".\n \n \n\n Quote:\n \"You want a specific and direct answer to a vague, nebulous, non-specific hypothetical question?!?\" \n \n \n Presumably if I were to ask you if a rock falls when unsupported, you'd be equally incapable of forming a response. After all: how big a rock?\n\n \n **\n All rocks fall, no matter their size. That's because an incorporeal, insubstantial, immaterial force called \"Gravity\", (for the sake of a name), acts upon all things in a universally identical fashion in any specified location. So I would be able to say, yes, anywhere that gravity acts upon it, but no other counter-force resists it.\n \n \n\n It's also more than a tad hypocritical to accuse NS of vagueness and non-specificity, and in the same thread advocate a 'force' capable of imbuing bacteria with 'intelligence' and enabling them to 'respond' to 'stimuli' by 'changing behaviour' and subsequently 'morphology' and 'genome'.\n\n \n **\n What's vague and non-specific about a natural force? Haven't you heard? Science has, over the past few centuries, specified and defined four of them already!\n \n \n\n Vitality is your vague, nebulous, non-specific catch-all hypothesis to explain every advantageous evolutionary trait, no matter what it is, what form the 'stimuli' take that inspire whatever behaviour occurs, and no matter what genetic change must follow.\n\n \n \n **\n No, it is not. \"Vitality\", (for the sake of a name), is a natural force yielding certain empirically observable natural behaviours, i.e., complex systematic cause and effect relations in live organisms, that simply cannot be explained by 'the four physical forces' that materialism has already been forced, kicking and squealing, to accept as a part of reality.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n \"the term 'beneficial' refers to those traits which appear, ex post facto, to have enabled a differentially higher reproductive rate; relatively, and in a strictly local set of circumstances.\" \n \n \n What's most amusing about this is that you're vigorously machinegunning Lamarck every bit as much as you're attacking Darwin. Recall that you insist behavioural change leads (somehow) to inheritable change - what's the use of inheritable change if what counts as 'beneficial' is as 'strictly local' as you claim?\n\n \n **\n What difference does it make that the environmental circumstances are local and relative, so long as the causal principle, Vitality, is universal and immutable? The problem with your \"NS\" is that it cannot be shown to be universal and immutable in the materialist/mechanist sense. It is merely a vague collective abstraction of nearly numberless anomalous mechanical events, most of them temporal, local, and self-counteracting.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n \"So now you're saying that \"NS\" is purely a statistical effect (i.e., numerical change in the differential distribution of various physical traits) as a result of organismic change, that is to say, evolution?\" \n \n \n I'm not 'now' saying anything of the sort. NS is a cumulative process of statistical influence;\n\n \n **\n What the heck is that supposed to mean?!?\n \n \n\n it's a feedback loop. \n\n \n **\n If it is, it's an uncontrolled, directionless, destructive, unproductive, entropic, accidentally formed mechanical feedback loop, as shown above in my posts.\n \n \n\n If you're trying to say that the reason we see more of a given trait in each successive generation is not that it was inherited from more successful breeders who themselves had that trait, but rather that over time more and more of a population seperately induce the same genetic change within themselves... well, I think I'd like to see some evidence for that.\n\n \n **\n The point is that the _distribution_ of a given inherited trait, expanding or contracting statistically within a population, is not the _evolution_ of that trait. It is, at most, an ecological effect of the origination, the evolution, of that trait in the first place. The issue is wrt 'origins', the arising of novelty and, sometimes, increased complexity. The statistical distribution of this novelty throughout a population is not the cause of its existence, but at most, the effect of its existance. \"NS\" cannot generate original traits--that much was eventually conceded by Darwin himself, who plagiarized Lamarck with what he pleased to call, \"Pangenesis\", in order to account for origins, i.e., evolution. It wasn't until Fisher, Haldane, & crew, wandering wide on Mendel's gene theory of inherited variation, metaphysically postulated that the entropic breakdown of the regulating inheritance mechanism, the genome, was responsible for originating changes that coincidentally, i.e., randomly, proved favourable to local organismic need, that Darwinism had a source for evolution. To keep it \"Darwinian\", and 'scientific', most materialist biologists kept \"NS\", pretending that this will o' the wisp somhow put the mechanical back in, that random mutation and coincidence had taken out. \n \n Another one down.",

What in the bit you quoted causes you to believe I've changed my mind? What made such a powerful impact that it nearly made you, \"throw down [your] keyboard and run, hooting, for the trees\"!?!? I'm quite astonished by you, actually.\n \n Once again, here are my opinions on \"Natural Selection\".\n \n 1/ \"NS\" is not a causal mechanism for evolution, (i.e., origins), and merely insisting that it is, does not make it so. Nor is it a 'causal mechanism/explanation' for the numerical fluctuations (statistical effects) observed in populations and ecosystems over time. \n \n 2/\"NS\" possesses no empirical reality of any kind, but is simply an abstract theoretical, a literary conceit, a false analogy to a human activity. It is a non-empirical, 'supernatural' entity drawn from a false anthropomorphic analogy. Another case of certain men creating a 'god', (or new-age 'earth-spirit'), after their own image.\n \n 3/Pointing out the fact of 'change over time' in populations and ecosystems does not explain those changes. Claiming \"NS\" as both the change observed and the cause of that change is the witless absurdty of claiming that a cause is its own effect, and vice-versa.\n \n 4/ Using \"NS\" as a mere 'label' for the observed after-effects of evolution- (numerical redistributions, i.e., expansions, contractions, and extinctions )- is dishonest, since it implies that whatever the effected statistical changes may be, they were the deliberate choice and directed outcome of an externally situated intelligent 'chooser', OR, a mechanically determined force. Instead of the truth; i.e., being nothing more than a simple statistical description of 'the way the cards happened to fall', at one time and in one place, for some local reason. Which statistics, in and of themselves, are simply facts, and as such do not explain themselves. See above, cause and effect.\n \n 5/I should add that the assumption that \"NS\" 'works' by removing the 'unfit' (those that do not reproduce) and leaving those that do produce, (i.e., the \"Fit\"),to produce even more, is a vacuous tautology. You may as well say that 'luck' does that. Or perhaps you see \"NS\" and \"Lady Luck\" as synonymous images? I could go that far.",

   "\n Variation in populations is the distal cause. Differential mortality and/or natality is the proximal cause. Observable change in allelic frequencies over time is the effect. \n\n \n **\n This too specious to ignore. Variation in populations is strictly an observed phenomenon, a brute fact. Because everything that 'is', is an effect caused by what preceded it, ergo everything we observe is an effect. Including the fact of variation in lifeforms.\n Effects turn into causes when they are responsible for bringing about a change in the status quo of _other_ existing effects. The mere fact that differences and variations and varieties exist cannot possibly be held responsible for the generation of new variations, nor even for differential statistical fluctuations in the various populations of those variations. To claim otherwise is to claim that an effect can be is its own cause. It's patently absurd, not to say downright stupid.\n Something other than variation itself has to be the cause of variation. This was pointed out to Darwin himself, and was such a problem for his \"evolution by natural selection\" that it was in deep scientific doo-doo until rescued from oblivion by the equally absurd notion that random genetic mutation was the cause of the observed effect, adaptive variation.\n \n Nor does an effect become a cause simply by labeling it a \"distal\" cause or a \"proximal\" cause.\n dis\u00b7tal (d&#301;s't&#601;l) \n adj.\n Anatomically located far from a point of reference, such as an origin or a point of attachment.\n Situated farthest from the middle and front of the jaw, as a tooth or tooth surface.\n \n So is johnhanks a dentist, or something?!!!?\n \n As for his assertion, that \"Differential mortality and/or natality is the proximal cause.\", he is again trying to turn an observation of an effect into its own cause. Trying claim that this effect causes, \"Observable change in allelic frequencies over time is the effect.\", is just more absurd sophistry, since the one does not cause the other, but in fact, both are only two different descriptions of the same effect. The first description is phenotypic, the second is genotypic. To claim that either is the actual \"cause\" of the other is totally circular.\n And just what is there to prevent the equally vacant claim that \"Observable change in allelic frequencies over time is the [proximal cause] of \"Differential mortality and/or natality\" (as its effect)? Nothing. In fact, that is exactly what \"random genetic mutation\" does claim.\n \n \n\n WW's insistence that these are somehow indistinguishable is the 'witless absurdity' in this instance: he is playing word games\n\n \n **\n I think that any unbiased reader can easily see just who is playing the \"word games\" around here, and whose ideas are \"witless absurdit[ies]\".",

My response to this attempt, above, was to point out to you that your assumption was beside the point of this thread, the point being the cause of the appearance of novelty in the first place, i.e., origins. That is, the mechanism that explains evolution in the bioforms and behaviours of organisms.\n \n But since I'm here, I'll comment on this red herring. \n \n The distribution of any given phenotypic trait depends more on 'accident', 'luck', than on any distinctive and particular advantage presumed, ex post facto, to have been conferred by it, since whether or not it is advantageous, at least by your reasoning, depends upon the accidents of circumstance (random/coincidental wrt 'fitness', remember?) in which it just happens to find itself. Differential 'fitness' as 'an accident of birth/inheritance' under purely local circumstances. \n \n That makes 'chance' a primary \"explanation\", (or rather, non-explanation), \n \" for trends in the frequency of inherited traits among a population\". If your 'NS' = your 'fitness', then they both = chance.\n \n Bolstering this premise are the facts of empirical field research, which demonstrate that survival and reproduction in the wild, except in times of general catastrophe, are not 'trait/allele dependent', since in any given population there is no great difference, (that is, difference great enough to make a positive difference in survival/reproduction rates), among members of that particular group.\n To put it in simple terms, fish and migratory birds and mammal litters and ungulate year classes have been tagged and, from their individual traits, predictions made as to their potential 'fitness'. In all cases \n it was nearly impossible to make such a prediction from observed traits in the immature, but even where there was enough of a difference to make some difference (eg., runts of litters), the actual outcomes in terms of 'fitness' bore no positive correlation to the predictions. In short, in the vast majority of cases, those not involving general catastrophe, your \"NS\" explanation for \"trends in the frequency of inherited traits among [members of] a population\" simply cannot be demonstrated empirically.\n In cases of 'general catastrophe', (which, being anomalies and therefore unpredictable and irregular, are random causes), 'fitness' (as survival and differential positive reproductive success), in your \"NS\", is either\n a/ a matter of lucky inheritance, an 'accident' of birth, (say, inherited immunity), or,\n b/simply a matter of everyone else being dead. (as in a meteor striking the earth).\n In either case, no real explanation of anything.\n \n Finally, here is another objection to your 'false dichotomy'-- both 'sexual selection' and 'random drift' can bring about \"trends in the frequency of inherited traits among a population\", entirely without any kind of causal agency that you might label, 'natural selection'.\n \n \n\n I asked which explanation you advocate. It's a simple enough question, but you dodged it, saying that the changing distribution of a trait isn't the origin of a trait. What tempted me to throw down my keyboard, incidentally, is that I've never once credited NS with being the origin of traits, and only described it in terms of the changing distribution of those traits in a population. \n\n \n \n **\n Yes, you've always avoided and evaded the actual point of this thread, that I must admit. But it has never made me so frustrated that I wished to break something! The issue as always, is not, as I am constantly forced to remind you, the fact of observed evolutionary effects but rather, the mechanism for their causation.\n \n \n \n\n The fact that you evaded the question and started talking about the origin of traits suggested to me that you were conceding that differential reproductive rates were responsible for trends in the distribution of traits.\n\n \n **\n To say that \"differential reproductive rates [are] responsible for trends in the distribution of traits\" is to say nothing meaningful, since it is as clear an example of a tautology as ever was. That is, \"differential reproductive rates\" are not, \"responsible for\", but rather, simply _are_ , \"trends in the distribution of traits\". \"differential reproductive rates\" = \"trends in the distribution of traits\". Tautologies are truisms, and as such, meaningless in scientific terms.\n \n \n \n\n If you're not, in fact, conceding any such thing, then I'll ask the question again:\n \n In your model of evolution, do advantageous traits increase in frequency over successive generations because more and more organisms independently self-induce the same mutation, or does it occur as a result of inheritance and differential reproductive rates?\n\n \n **\n \"Advantageous trait increase\", where and when it actually occurs, occurs as an ecological phenomenon, and not as an evolutionary phenomenon, (unless you are actually studying the evolution of 'ecosystems' and not that of 'organisms'). It concerns populations, not the biology of the organism itself.\n \n As an ecological phenomenon it occurs for any number of reasons, _as I have already shown, above_, including, but not limited to, \"more and more organisms independently self-induc[ing] the same mutation\". In short, numerical flutuations in traits/alleles in a given population can occur for many reasons, only some of them having to do with evolution itself, most having to do with happenstance. Pure chance. Or even through indirect, accidental, human interference. (I do not include 'breeding', i.e., deliberate human interference, because it is not of the same category as natural reproduction, and so, not of natural evolution, either). \n \n Your \"NS\" seems to me to be no cause for, \"differential reproductive rates\" and is not \" responsible for trends in the distribution of traits\", but rather , is simply an abstraction, a name, a label, affixed to the phenomenon \"differential reproductive rates/trends in the distribution of traits\". Natural 'diffusion' or natural 'distribution' would be a more honest label, and it still would not 'explain' itself, or anything else.",

I have not yet had time to respond to your post on the 1943 Luria/Delbruck fluctuation test, but in a nutshell there is absolutely no reason, in view of recent insights into the behaviours of eusocial bacteria colonies, to believe that any pre-experimental resistance was caused by the 'spontaneous generation' of a coincidentally adaptive accidental genetic mutation.\n As to whether the resistance found was part of the normal operation of e.coli. colonies, that is, was just one more instance in a multi- million year history of carrying a tendency to generate resistance at a certain level of colony development, or whether that inherent resistance also required a trigger of partial exposure remains to be seen, as I have not yet been given enough time to even read your comments on the experiment! I'll go back and respond to them ASAP.\n \n \n\n I find it ridiculous in the extreme that you credit individual creatures with the ability to intelligently modify their genome for either their own benefit or 'the greater good', yet at the same time insist that the ubiquity of a particular trait in a population arises purely by random chance.\n\n \n **\n You do not seem to recognise the difference between a statement about the biological mechanism that generates novelty in actual biological forms and behaviours, and another statement about the statistical fluctuation of various traits within an abstraction called a 'population'.\n \n What I've pointed out to you, but which you refuse to see, is that under normal environmental conditions the members of any given population are too similar for such a thing as a peculiarly rare allele for a peculiarly rare trait to ever make any adaptive difference between carriers and non-carriers. Except of course, in the case of entropic genetic accidents, particularly at the chromosomal level, which invariably, always and everywhere, have an overall negative effect on 'fitness'.\n \n Instead, all 'fitness' differences (differential survival and reproduction) in individual organisms under those static conditions are merely the trivial and temporary result of chance events. More important, under such conditions, genotype homogeneity would erase any temporary and trivial (neutral) yet 'theoretically' advantageous differences in phenotypes within a single generation. Whether you can face it or not, \"NS\" in stable ecosystems is either some vapourous pipedream, or just another word for 'luck'. \n \n As for what applies under generally catastrophic (for the entire population)\n conditions, your notion, \"NS\", here as well boils down to mere luck, both for organisms and for 'populations'. Accident of inherited allele, or accident of time and place. \n My theory does not depend upon the luck of some accidentally generated allele just hanging about in a genotype for generations, like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer waiting for some foggy night, (whereupon the adaptive advantages of his/its little red light will be made plain to all :) .) Instead, neo-lamarckian devo-evo, or as I call it, Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis, responds to an immediate, proximate, chronic, severe, (but not entirely fatal) environmental stimulus, by means of a goal-seeking heuristic search (i.e., feedback mechanisms, internal controls, and search-space oscillations). In this process the affected parts of the organism first develop novel behaviours that induce morphogenic changes, then inherit them epigenetically, and finally, incorporate them genetically. It doesn't need any wishy-washy \"NS\" description of its effects, because it is adequate to _explain_ them all by itself, and they can _describe_ themselves to anyone with eyes and the ability to count. \n \n \n\n Quote:\n whether or not it is advantageous, at least by your reasoning, depends upon the accidents of circumstance (random/coincidental wrt 'fitness', remember?) in which it just happens to find itself. Differential 'fitness' as 'an accident of birth/inheritance' under purely local circumstances. \n \n \n You've said this before, and it remains an absurd exaggeration that damns Lamarckism every bit as much as Darwinism. What's the point of a 'behaviour' becoming cast in inheritable genetic stone if its value is so specifically local to an individual that it can confer no general advantage?\n\n \n **\n An excellent question, and one that a lot of extinct creatures probably had as their very last thought. ;)\n The only answer I can come up with is that, in spite of genetics, bioforms and behaviours are not really, 'cast in stone', and inheritance of newly maladaptive traits can be overcome, sometimes, by some organisms, through the internally directed intelligent responses they make, dynamically, to novel environmental stimuli. And that's what we call, 'evolution'. By EAM.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Bolstering this premise are the facts of empirical field research, which demonstrate that survival and reproduction in the wild, except in times of general catastrophe, are not 'trait/allele dependent', since in any given population there is no great difference, (that is, difference great enough to make a positive difference in survival/reproduction rates), among members of that particular group. \n \n \n Unfortunately for field researchers, the more subtle the influence the more generations are required to observe a trend, since in the short term random, chance-induced 'jitter' will mask the effects. \n\n \n **\n Exactly so.\n \n \n\n The fact is that differential reproductive rates are an observable mechanism for changes in alelle frequencies - those links I gave you to the yeast experiment demonstrate precisely that.\n\n \n **\n Did you read that piece I posted on yeast? And when are you going to realize that \"differential reproductive rates\" and \"changes in allele frequencies\" amount to the exact same thing? You can't have one without the other.\n \n \n\n Unfortunately it's not feasible to study 10,000 generations of fish, birds and mammals in order to observe the same effects in action, and 10,000 generations is a drop in the metaphorical ocean. \n\n \n **\n It's only your hypothetical mechanism, being based on your belief in random generation, that requires 'the magic of great big numbers' to accomplish meaningful evolution in organisms. The fact is that we see more and more instance of rapid evolution every day, some requiring no more than a few generations to make an impact.\n \n The real reason you guys favour bacteria and yeasts is that they are more susceptible to 'point mutations' than are more complex organisms. But the fact is that even plants, insects, arachnids, fish, shellfish and everything else has shown an ability to mutate itself in much less than your \"10,000 generations\" in order to suit novel and chronic conditions,-- even human beings living in the Andes and Himalayas do, wrt oxygen metabolization.\n Herbicide and pesticide resistant organisms are a case in point. Even mice have become toxin resistant.\n \n \n\n You're correct in saying that the more catastrophic the environmental change, the more pronounced and observable differential reproductive rates become - your error is in declaring there is some kind of hard line dividing sufficiently and insufficiently catastrophic environmental change. No such line exists, except in practical terms of observing the effects within the lifetime of our civilisation \n\n \n **\n A catastrophe is, in my understanding, an event that impacts all members of a population at pretty much the same time, or within a relatively short period of time. An event is either catastrophic in that sense, or it is not. You are the one who prefers to talk in terms of whole populations, after all.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n In cases of 'general catastrophe', (which, being anomalies and therefore unpredictable and irregular, are random causes), 'fitness' (as survival and differential positive reproductive success), in your \"NS\", is either\n a/ a matter of lucky inheritance, an 'accident' of birth, (say, inherited immunity), \n \n \n Describing inherited immunity as an accident is just plain wrong; there's nothing accidental about it, any more than the children of rich parents being rich is accidental.\n\n \n **\n It is my point that being born with a silver spoon in your mouth is a lucky accident, as far as you, the fortunate child, are concerned. It's an unlucky accident for you if you happen to be born to a crack whore in the South Bronx, East L.A., or Glasgow.\n \n The origin of inherited traits that are advantageous under catastrophic conditions brings us back from your \"NS\" to our start point---evolution. For instance, HIV resistance can be traced back to the Black Death of the 14th century, but that resistance originated earlier on, probably in the original 'plague years' of the 4th century CE, 1,000 years earlier. At that time, in one city alone, Constantinople, 250,000 people died of bubonic plague in a matter of months. Millions died, all the way to roman Britain. Either then, or over the following generations and local recurrences, resistance appeared. There is no reason to believe that that resistance occurred thanks to the good luck of a spontaneously generated allele, any more than to attribute it to \"God's Mercy\". \n \n \n \n\n I suppose that if you take the view that we are all pre-existing souls or ids and are allocated bodies at random, inherited wealth is accidental, but the 'accident' there is which soul goes to which body, not which body gets the cash (or the immunity, for that matter).\n\n \n **\n You do make strange assumptions!! None of this stuff applies to me. Leaving aside the metaphysics (I'm not a Calvinist, a Mormon, or even a \"christian\", as that term is usually understood), it is obvious to most people that the acquisition of wealth is one thing, but the inheritance of it is another-- just plain good luck.\n \n \n\n This is what I meant when I said earlier that you will stoop to anything to deny that non-intelligent filtering can count as constructive 'selection'.\n\n \n **\n I never \"stoop\" to anything. I rely on logic and empirically observed facts to make my case. It is you and your people who stoop to \"Humpty Dumpty Semantics\" and other sophist tricks in order to support your insupportable notions. \n I have never denied the existence of non-intelligent 'filtering' or 'sorting'. In fact, I was the one who brought those terms forward as an honest way to present, mechanically, what you attribute to \"NS\". I even gave you the example of hydrodynamic sand/gravel/boulder separation. I simply insist that \"selection\" is deceptive word in biology, when only mechanical sorting and sifting are denotated, because \"selection\" connotes intelligence. It is intentionally misleading, unless you mean to imply intelligence.\n If you want to point out instances where creatures are 'sorted' by mindless natural mechanics, whether they 'like it or not', then go ahead. If you can. It makes no big difference to me. What is a big deal is the deceitful use of 'selection' by people who are supposedly talking about mindless natural mechanical sorting and sifting processes.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n The issue as always, is not, as I am constantly forced to remind you, the fact of observed evolutionary effects but rather, the mechanism for their causation. \n \n \n As we've established already: random mutation.\n\n \n \n **\n As I've already said, \"You wish!!\".\n \n \n\n The question of how traits become widely established is a significant one.\n\n \n **\n Yes, it is, to ecologists and to ecology. And right now, ecological concerns are far more serious than evolutionary concerns. But origination and distribution are still not the same thing, no matter how loud you holler.\n \n \n\n Members of a species have a huge number of genes in common, all of which were, at one time or another, novel. How and why did they become ubiquitous?\n\n \n **\n Presumably because they were adaptive, as opposed to maladaptive, in most places at most times. The issue for evolution is, how did they arise in the first place? That's the hard question. Your question is so simple that it answers itself.\n \n \n \n\n Your twin claims, that adaptive traits are too locally specific for inheritance to confer an advantage,\n\n \n **\n I have never made the above statement, although I did imply 'no _permanent_ advantage'. To the contrary, I have repeatedly pointed out that the entire role of the genome is to act as the organism's mechanism for the conservation and preservation of adaptive form and behaviour, in order to \"confer the advantage\" of not having to \"re-invent the wheel\" with each generation. That is what inheritance is all about. Evolution is about avercoming inheritance in order to create something different.\n \n When traits actually are adaptive, they are usually shared by all members of a population. If traits are not homogenously distributed, then they are neutral or maladaptive under normal conditions. Advantageous mutations do not generate themselves out of the blue in historically stable ecosystems. Even though your \"spontaneous generation\" model says that they should do precisely that, more often than not.\n \n \n\n and that they proliferate purely by 'random chance', are jointly and severally foolish; \n\n \n **\n How can it be that a trait that is , in your notion, only advantageous by happy coincidence with local environmental conditions, is anything more than a 'random accident'?\n The fact that some traits are better adapted to some environments, others better suited to other environments, is simply a fact, not an explanation for that fact. It doesn't need an explanation, because it's so obvious that it's self-explanatory.\n Only the origins of adaptive traits requires the effort of scientific research. What causes them? As for the population effects of adaptive traits versus maladaptive traits, there is nothing there but truisms, tautologies, and triviality. When was the last time that you had to explain, (to anyone older than three), the 'fitness' implications of a bird with a broken wing, or an upside-down goldfish? It just the fact of life and death.\n \n \n\n if true, why would members of a species be so genetically homogeneous and well adapted to their environments?\n\n \n **\n Because their ancestors generated/evolved adaptive traits and then passed them down to them by inheritance, and the genome and organism fought against accidental genetic changes that would screw up a good thing, and, where extreme mutants were expressed, they were so maladaptive that they were unable to cope with environmental and organismic demands, and so they died. Just like birds with broken wings, or overfed goldfish, or old men, die when they cannot cope. \n \n \n\n Quote:\n \"Advantageous trait increase\", where and when it actually occurs, occurs as an ecological phenomenon, and not as an evolutionary phenomenon, (unless you are actually studying the evolution of 'ecosystems' and not that of 'organisms'). It concerns populations, not the biology of the organism itself. \n \n \n Funnily enough, it is populations that evolve. Variant individuals are mutants.\n\n \n **\n In your world.

   "You do not seem to recognise the difference between a statement about the biological mechanism that generates novelty in actual biological forms and behaviours, and another statement about the statistical fluctuation of various traits within an abstraction called a 'population'.\n\n \n Not at all. What I succeed in recognising is that random variation and filtering together achieve similar results to intelligently directed adaptive mutation. You wrongly focus in on just the adaptive mutations and say: look, that's evolution! And in yet another feat of circular logic, having defined evolution as just the occurrence of adaptive mutations, you declare that since no filtering process is involved it must be intelligently directed. All I'm doing is taking a step back and saying: look, mutations occur all the time, and the population is loaded with variant alelles; there's no evidence that some mutations are directed and others are not. And look: a filtering process, in the form of differential reproductive rates. To briefly return to evolutionary microchip design, it is as if you are focusing upon just the better designs, rather than the whole evolutionary process of variation and filtering, and insisting that somebody must be intelligently creating those specific designs.\n \n \nWhat I've pointed out to you, but which you refuse to see, is that under normal environmental conditions the members of any given population are too similar for such a thing as a peculiarly rare allele for a peculiarly rare trait to ever make any adaptive difference between carriers and non-carriers.\n\n \n You should be glad I don't accept the implied significance of that statement, since it would, just like many of your other arguments, equally deflate Lamarckism - which requires 'robust, chronic stimuli' before it can swing into action every bit as much as NS does.\n \n Yes, the 'selective pressure' imposed by the environment (the differential reproductive rates it exposes in variant individuals) is indeed sometimes very slight, and populations experiencing such times stockpile neutral mutations. But no environment is permanently constant. Migration and expansion of populations results in encounters with new environments - including predators, diseases, food sources etc etc) in which some of the stockpiled mutations are exposed as adaptive. As I detail later on, encountering novel environments on the fringe of a population is particularly effective at filtering and reinforcing adaptive traits.\n \n \nMore important, under such conditions, genotype homogeneity would erase any temporary and trivial (neutral) yet 'theoretically' advantageous differences in phenotypes within a single generation.\n\n \n That's 'can', not 'would'. A neutral change has, by definition, every bit as good a chance of persisting in the gene pool as any other trait, and local interbreeding patterns can quickly establish a substantial colony sharing a particular trait.\n \n \nIn this process the affected parts of the organism first develop novel behaviours that induce morphogenic changes, then inherit them epigenetically, and finally, incorporate them genetically.\n\n \n What a shame that process bears no resemblence to reality! It's such a lovely story :)\n \n One counter-example I've cited several times now, with no response, is that there's no possible behavioural change that could enable a bacteria to utilise nylon as a carbon source. It's mutation or nothing.\n \n \nDid you read that piece I posted on yeast? And when are you going to realize that \"differential reproductive rates\" and \"changes in allele frequencies\" amount to the exact same thing? You can't have one without the other.\n\n \n Wrong, and wrong. You could have changes in alelle frequencies without differential reproductive rates: independent identical mutation. And differential reproductive rates result in changes in alelle frequencies. One is the cumulative effect of the other; they are not the same thing.\n \n \nThe fact is that we see more and more instance of rapid evolution every day, some requiring no more than a few generations to make an impact.\n\n \n And the fact is, we see that rapid evolution in precisely the kind of environmental conditions, or changes in condition, that induce strongly differential reproductive rates.\n \n You seem to be contradicting yourself here: one minute you're saying that we don't see advantageous traits proliferating, and that there's no such thing as a non-immediately-local advantageous trait, and that's why NS is wrong, and the next you're saying we do see advantageous traits proliferating rapidly, and that's why NS is wrong.\n \n Contradicting yourself is becoming a bit of a habit. I noticed in the earlier analysis of the boom/bust hares that you were so keen to disagree with me on every concievable level that within the space of a few lines you first denied that fecundity was successful (you said it failed), because it leads to another population crash, and then, when I said that it was not the solution an intelligent agent would devise 'for the greater good', you changed your mind completely and said that no, it was perfectly intelligent and successful because there are still plenty of hares around.\n \n I'm also still waiting, ever hopeful, for you to retract your earlier criticism of 'emergence', in light of your reliance on a non-specified, some might say mystical mechanism for generating intelligence from the interaction of vitality and an organism's physical form, neither of which possess that quality in themselves.\n \n \nThe real reason you guys favour bacteria and yeasts is that they are more susceptible to 'point mutations' than are more complex organisms. But the fact is that even plants, insects, arachnids, fish, shellfish and everything else has shown an ability to mutate itself in much less than your \"10,000 generations\" in order to suit novel and chronic conditions,-- even human beings living in the Andes and Himalayas do, wrt oxygen metabolization.\n\n \n Your first statement is quite correct: bacteria and yeasts reproduce rapidly and prolifically enough that point mutations can be observed under laboratory conditions. However, the other examples of rapid evolution you mention involve a multitude of factors and should not be blanket-labelled 'mutation'.\n \n One factor empowering NS in more complex creatures, ironically enough given our argument, is volitional response. Not in the way you claim, with an organism intelligently modifying its own genetic code to better suit the enviroment, but quite the reverse: an organism seeking an environment to which it is suited and avoiding environments to which it is not.\n \n Humans relatively rapidly exhibiting adaptation to life in the Himalayas, for example, is fundamentally different from bacteria deposited unceremoniously on a phage plate. We need not assume that the first settlers in those altitudes were a largely undifferentiated mass of humanity in which just one or two possessed adaptive traits, or that only those with those traits survived to breed. Humans migrated to those altitudes voluntarily. While it undoubtedly killed some, many of those genetically unsuited to the task would simply find life there too hard and try to live somewhere else to increase their chances of, as you say, surviving, thriving and reproducing. I don't deny those goals, you see; I only dispute your claim that I can modify my own genetic code to achieve them. It's a case of Mohammed leaving the mountain because it's too bloody cold, rather than Mohammed gritting his teeth and growing fur. I know which I find more feasible :)\n \n Exactly the same 'kick start' to NS is likely to occur on the fringes of many populations: novel environments to which only a few members of the population carry adaptive traits will be settled more intensively by that fraction of the population, who will as a result interbreed much more often than they did when mixed in with everybody else. This reinforces phenotypic traits at an accellerated rate, and correlates well with observations of punctuated equilibrium and relatively small sites of speciation.\n \n \nIt is my point that being born with a silver spoon in your mouth is a lucky accident, as far as you, the fortunate child, are concerned.\n\n \n Such an analysis presupposes that same child could have been born to other parents, and that being born to those parents is the lucky accident. This is nonsense: if the rich parents have a child, it will be rich; there's nothing random or accidental about it. The offspring of immune parents is immune - again, no accident and nothing random has occurred.\n \n \nThere is no reason to believe that that resistance occurred thanks to the good luck of a spontaneously generated allele, any more than to attribute it to \"God's Mercy\". \n\n \n But since mutations do occur at random all the time, we don't need a special reason to believe that one of them was fortuitously adaptive. We need a special reason to believe it wasn't random.\n \n \nI have never denied the existence of non-intelligent 'filtering' or 'sorting'.\n\n \n No, you've just quibbled endlessly over the use of the word 'selection' in NS, despite NS being, for the hojillionth time, an illustrative term chosen deliberately to draw a parallel between the similar capabilities of random variation + filtering vs intelligently driven selection. \n \n \nI simply insist that \"selection\" is deceptive word in biology, when only mechanical sorting and sifting are denotated, because \"selection\" connotes intelligence. It is intentionally misleading, unless you mean to imply intelligence. <snip< What is a big deal is the deceitful use of 'selection' by people who are supposedly talking about mindless natural mechanical sorting and sifting processes.\n\n \n Like I said all along, our interminable debate in which you heaped scorn upon the process NS was coined to describe is really just a reflection of your personal semantic bee-in-the-bonnet about the use of a word in an illustrative layman's term already acknowledged to be potentially misleading and strictly innacurate by all educated adherents to the Modern Synthesis.\n \n What a stupendous waste of time.\n \n \nBut origination and distribution are still not the same thing, no matter how loud you holler.\n\n \n Point me to where I even whispered a word to the contrary. I'm losing count of how many times you've now lied about my expressed opinions.\n \n \nPresumably because they were adaptive, as opposed to maladaptive, in most places at most times.\n\n \n Well, it's heartening to finally hear you admit it. Hopefully now we'll hear no more nonsense about long-term differential reproductive rates being 'impossible because traits are strictly locally advantageous'.\n \n \nThe issue for evolution is, how did they arise in the first place? That's the hard question.\n\n \n By random mutation.\n \n Like I said up towards the top of this post, you've got tunnel vision. Yes, hypothetically a kind of evolution could proceed via intelligently chosen adaptive mutations. And if adaptive mutation were all we ever saw, it would be a good hypothesis. But for all kinds of empirically observed reasons it's obvious that biological evolution doesn't proceed like that. We see lots of mutations, not just adaptive ones. There's no way, given the observed mutation rate, that independent self-mutation can explain the pattern of genetic homogeneity we observe in a species. To explain that, we must postulate (and confirm, as we have done) statistical, distributive mechanisms at work (ie NS, drift, etc etc) - and once we have those, we don't need intelligently directed mutation at all, for anything, because we have a statistical, distributive filter to explain why we see around us, surviving, so many successful, adaptive traits filtered out of the random ones that crop up from time to time.\n \n \nAdvantageous mutations do not generate themselves out of the blue in historically stable ecosystems. Even though your \"spontaneous generation\" model says that they should do precisely that, more often than not.\n\n \n Will you please go and actually read the yeast link I posted? Spontaneous advantageous mutations occurring after a period of 800, 1000 or more stable reproductive generations. Call me when you figure out how to spot the same occurence in wild organisms reproducing once a year or less.\n \n \nThe fact that some traits are better adapted to some environments, others better suited to other environments, is simply a fact, not an explanation for that fact. It doesn't need an explanation, because it's so obvious that it's self-explanatory.\n\n \n Exactly.\n \n \nOnly the origins of adaptive traits requires the effort of scientific research. What causes them?\n\n \n Oh - so near, and yet so far. You have a whole heap of random mutations, a small fraction of them advantageous. Everything you need to reach the correct conclusion is right there in front of you. But instead, it's like you're rolling a die and screaming \"why does it sometimes come up 6?\"\n \n It comes up six sometimes because that's one of the numbers on the die. Adaptive mutations arise sometimes because some of the possible tiny changes that can occur to a genome are adaptive to its environment, and there's nothing to prevent those tiny changes occurring at random. Sometimes the die just comes up a 6.\n \n \nAs for the population effects of adaptive traits versus maladaptive traits, there is nothing there but truisms, tautologies, and triviality.\n\n \n Surely the inevitability, the 'truism' of advantageous traits increasing in frequency, is a hint that it happens, not that it doesn't! It's quite amusing to watch you trying to discredit Darwinism on the grounds that it \"can't not work\".\n \n \nYou seem to be agreeing with me!?!\n\n \n I doubt it :)",

Hence the punctuated fossil record, and fish, plants, insects, etc., that have not evolved significantly in hundreds of millions of years.\n OTH, the Darwinian notion of constant and perpetual accidental genetic change, and accumulation, in a mechanism that is genetic mutation based, cannot allow for morphological and behavioural stasis over so many generations.\n That is why this notion, that there exists some mechanical force, \"NS\", to restore direction, regularity and predictability to the random generation of accidental genetic variation, still persists. The problem for that notion, however, is that absolutely no empirical evidence that \"NS\", this supposed, 'mechanical force, principle, agent or agency of causation' exists. \n \n All we ever see is ubiquitous change, and change, per se, is not the cause of change, in se. Until you people can demonstrate that \"NS\" is truly more than just a literary pen-name or pseudonym or synonym for the fact of 'change' itself, you've got nothing real to talk about. You have to be able to show that \"NS\" is something non-metaphysical that can actually change the physical. In my book, only what we call 'forces', such as my, \"Vitality\", can do that.

What a crowded little genome we have here! If not, what takes them out, since, evidently, your \"NS\" does not do it? I say that the organism itself is what throws out the garbage, but you scoff at that, so what's your alternative?\n \n \n\n Quote:\n One counter-example I've cited several times now, with no response, is that there's no possible behavioural change that could enable a bacteria to utilise nylon as a carbon source. It's mutation or nothing.\n\n \n \n **\n Yes it is. It's just not \"accidental, random, chance-dependent, unrelated to environment or organismic need, coincidental\" mutation.\n \n Five years ago, when this phenomenon first was publicised, I showed how it was evidence for the EAM mechanism of of organismic response to an immediate and proximate environmental stimulus, and not just some fortuitous genetic accident. Even though it's no better than a superstition, the belief that these bacteria just happened to win the 'accidental genetic mutation' loto still persists among darwinists and the childishly gullible.\n \n The fact is that the obvious behavioural change is that the chronicall starving bacterial began ingesting and attempting to digest the the nylon. Much as starving Irish peasants tried to eat and digest grasses, before dying with green mouths. Eventually, as per EAM, the colonies got better and better at digesting nylon, epigentically and developmentally, until they became what they are now. Nylon-munching bacteria.\n \n Here's a suggestion. Why don't you repeat the L&D'43 fluctuation test, but with this nylon solution instead of streptomycin, and see if you get the same old results all over again? I say you won't, so long as you use bacteria that have no connection to these newly evolved, nylon-munching variants. For the simple reason that this would be brand new to them, while for L&D '43 the artificially sensitive e.coli simply reverted, overnight, to their normal resistance, once each colony/culture had re-developed back to the size necessary to that normal trait.\n \n However, my bet is that other bacteria kept over generations in those nylon-rich, (but normal forage poor), conditions, would themselves produce this exact same 'mutation' that you think was a lucky accident, and they would do it in a fraction of the number of generations (in terms of probability theory) it would take for any, 'lucky genetic accident', to cause 'lightning' to 'strike twice' in the same organism.\n \n Break time.

All the more reason to dismiss L&D'43. :) \n However, EAM does postulate _directed_ \"independent identical mutation\", so I'll amend my statement to read, \"\"differential reproductive rates\" and \"changes in allele frequencies\" amount to the exact same thing [under the RM+NS model of evolution's driving mechanism]\".\n \n \n \n\n And differential reproductive rates result in changes in alelle frequencies.

The speed and specificity of the organismic response to the particular environmental stimulus that immediately confronts it, and no other, belies the fantasy that the adaptive mutation happened by 'lucky accident'.\n \n Any robust change in adaptedness results in a correspondence with \n with survival, and survival with reproduction. Either positively or negatively. It has to, because it's simply a tautologous truism. Adaptedness means, in effect, the ability to survive, thrive, and reproduce.\n \n As I've pointed out several times, that's just 'survival of the fittest' all over again. The deal is that under normal, stable, environmental conditions any robust change in adaptedness is invariably negative, and leads to death. Only after a robust change in environmental conditions (a catastrophe) causing general maladaptedness can a robust change in adaptedness signify something positive. Something that increases survival, well-being, and reproduction.\n When an organism has that evolutionary adaptedness, it's simply a trivial, vacuous truism, bordering on the inane, to point out that numerically it's going to outdo it's relatives, those that are not as adapted as it is to the new environmental reality. It's like saying, \"See, I told you that that healthy horse could outrun that horse with the broken leg!\" Evolution needs no fanciful \"NS\" to explain its effects on populations. They are as commonsensical as finding that your coffee is bitter because you forgot to sweeten it. There is no need for an additional, gratuitous and redundant \"mechanism\" such as \"NS\" in any evolutionary biology that does not reduce itself to a superstitious faith in accidental, yet coincidentally adaptive, genetic mutations.\n \n \n\n You seem to be contradicting yourself here: one minute you're saying that we don't see advantageous traits proliferating, and that there's no such thing as a non-immediately-local advantageous trait, and that's why NS is wrong, and the next you're saying we do see advantageous traits proliferating rapidly, and that's why NS is wrong.\n\n \n \n **\n Pay close attention. We _do not see_ advantageous traits proliferating, or even putting in a brief appearance, when environmental conditions are stable and the residents of an ecosystem are well-established and adapted to it. That's why we see no evolution of any significance happening under those conditions, even over millions of years. RMNS says we should, but the fossil record and certain organisms of long date say we don't. I'll take the empirical route over the theoretical, doctrinal route on this one.\n \n We _do see_ advantageous traits \"proliferating\" at times, but only _after_ organisms find themselves in ecosystems to which they are maladapted, either because there normal ecosystem underwent a robust change, leaving them maladapted, or they were somehow transferred to a different ecosystem, one to which they were maladapted. Maladaptation is what stimulates organisms to redesign and reconstitute themselves. That is why you only find maladapted organisms evolving. One of nature's rules, (having something to do with the conservation of energy) is, \"If it ain't broke, don't 'fix' it.\".\n \n And that is why, in both static and dynamic environmental conditions, \"NS\" is not so much 'wrong', as utterly impertinent and imaginary, with no relevance to adaptation and evolution.\n \n \n\n Contradicting yourself is becoming a bit of a habit. \n\n \n **\n My self-contradictions exist solely in the realm of your own capacity to misconstrue what I say. Every time you've accused me of such, I've lobbed the accusation right back to you, as above.\n \n \n\n I noticed in the earlier analysis of the boom/bust hares that you were so keen to disagree with me on every concievable level that within the space of a few lines you first denied that fecundity was successful (you said it failed), because it leads to another population crash, and then, when I said that it was not the solution an intelligent agent would devise 'for the greater good', you changed your mind completely and said that no, it was perfectly intelligent and successful because there are still plenty of hares around.\n\n \n **\n Short term failure, long term success. For an example of short term success, long term failure, look at the introduction of rabbits to Australia.\n \n Rodents intelligently devised a high reproduction rate to counter their incredibly high mortality rate. But they usually only have a high mortality rate in ecosystems where there are a wide variety of predators that eat them. In neither the northern arboreal forest of Canada, nor in the Australian farm and bush country, were there any significant numbers of different kinds of predators. Therefore, the usually adaptive rodent mechanism for group survival, i.e., fecundity, is maladapted to these severely narrow ecosystems, at least in the short term. The only reason these hares and rabbits and rats on desert islands don't go extinct by eating themselves out of house and home is that as soon as hunger becomes chronic, they weaken and suffer a catastrophic die-off, thanks either to hunger itself or the diseases that come with malnutrition. So long as the die off is not a total extinction, the overreproduction/mass die off cycle will persist, since, even though it doesn't work well, it is at least partially successful, over the long haul. There are degrees of success. It's not a pass/fail marking system.\n \n But if you think that over-population is 'a good thing', (and let's face it, your notion of 'fitness' says that it is!!), then just take a look at what we humans are doing to a world that has become our northern boreal forest, our Australian outback, our desert island. \n \n \n\n I'm also still waiting, ever hopeful, for you to retract your earlier criticism of 'emergence', in light of your reliance on a non-specified, some might say mystical mechanism for generating intelligence from the interaction of vitality and an organism's physical form, neither of which possess that quality in themselves.\n\n \n Well, so long as you're not holding your breath, I'm sure you'll be alright. :)\n The thing is, there is a big difference between your physical 'emergence', which claims that the physical parts of a whole can, without external input, spontaneously generate psychic qualities that they themselves, in whole or in part, do not possess. That your 'emergence' in biological systems is merely an appeal to ' creatio ex nihilo'. My claim, OTH, is that an external force, Vitality, interacting with physical systems, can generate the intrinsic intelligence and other psychical phenomena that purely mechanical, inanimate systems cannot generate.\n \n \n \n\n Humans relatively rapidly exhibiting adaptation to life in the Himalayas, for example, is fundamentally different from bacteria deposited unceremoniously on a phage plate. \n\n \n **\n Probably, but that's not my comparison; it's yours and yours alone. IAC, I should try and find the links that say that in at least one of the instances the increased oxygen uptake capacity is genetic as well as epigenetic. But it's been years since I looked at the stuff, and my memory isn't at all trustworthy.\n \n \n\n Exactly the same 'kick start' to NS is likely to occur on the fringes of many populations: novel environments to which only a few members of the population carry adaptive traits will be settled more intensively by that fraction of the population, who will as a result interbreed much more often than they did when mixed in with everybody else. This reinforces phenotypic traits at an accellerated rate, and correlates well with observations of punctuated equilibrium and relatively small sites of speciation.\n\n \n **\n It only correlates well with your pre-formed expectations. In short, you're concocting a 'just-so' story. Yes, isolated populations 'interbreed', but experiences of appalachian-style incest seldom turn up any special advantage wrt the local environment. Unless you call the banjo-playing idiot-savant autistic boy in \"Deliverance\" particularly adapted to the mountains.\n Your assumption that people freely settle where it suits them to do so does not positively correlate with my reading of history. \n \n \n\n Quote:\n It is my point that being born with a silver spoon in your mouth is a lucky accident, as far as you, the fortunate child, are concerned. \n \n \n Such an analysis presupposes that same child could have been born to other parents, and that being born to those parents is the lucky accident. This is nonsense: if the rich parents have a child, it will be rich; there's nothing random or accidental about it. The offspring of immune parents is immune - again, no accident and nothing random has occurred.\n\n \n \n **\n That would only be true if all differences, biological and social, were mechanically pre-determined and predestined and inevitable. Pretty much the calvinist/manichee view of life. In a world with some random chance in it, (and quantum physics says that that's the world we live in), fortunate and unfortunate, as value judgements, are permissable. As are all other value judgements. So I'll just go on calling children born to privilege, prosperity, and power as 'lucky' , and those born to squalor, misery, and exploitation as 'unlucky', thanks very much.\n \n My typing finger hurts.

You are of course free to believe whatever you like, and I'm sure you'll be very happy doing so, but now that we've established it is, in fact, an unfalsifiable belief and not a hypothesis, there's not much point trying to continue a rational argument to disprove it.\n \n Thanks for the discussion; it's been a rare challenge on all kinds of levels.",

I responded in kind to your post, and you ask what my point is. You tried a bit of mud slinging and you got called on it. Grow up. I'm not asking you to apologise, but given that you are clearly not a scientist, it seems logical that you have a religious bent in all this, and it's not a huge leap of logic to deduce Abrahamic sympathies...\n \n \nDon't try that cop-out. Science, as empiricism and inductive reasoning, has had an enormous effect upon philosophy in all its aspects, including ethics, ever since the Reformation and the decline of deductive reasoning. It is the responsibility of scientists to speak out when their theories are used to justify social behaviours, and not to simply wave it off as non-scientists committing the naturalist fallacy, and so none of their intellectual and moral responsibility to correct misinterpretation of their findings.\n\n \n So you argue that scientists have responsibility for their ideas, and that's fine. However, when that idea is taken and wrongly used to achieve an end, or to justify an action, how much clout does a scientist have? I'd also like to know if you hold the same for religious leaders....\n \n \nMore to the point, the darwinian notion, (natural selection), of subtracting the 'common' from the 'noble', the 'best' from the 'ordinary', the 'elite' from everyone else, dates back to pre-history and the beginnings of agriculture. It is in fact the foundation of the notion of 'the elect', (or 'select'),in the calvinist tradition of 'salvation' out of which Darwin's big idea was carved. \n\n \n So now Darwin's theories are merely revisionist religion? Is that the point you are making? Surely recognition that nature has animals that do better than others merely adds weight to the theory of natural selection, by suggesting that some animals are better adapted than others....\n \n \nHe came to think so, and much repented himself of it. So much so that the yanks put him on trial for his regrets.\n\n \n So they did, but they tried him for communism. My question wasn't 'was he responsible for the atomic bomb', but rather, 'was he responsible for the decision to drop it on two heavily populated areas, when dropping it on an island near Japan may well have worked?'\n \n \nCertainly depends on your god, doesn't it?\n\n \n There's something snide in this, which I can't pin down.\n \n \nActually, your \"ToE\" remains scientifically unsupported and unvalidated ever since Fisher and Haldane dreampt up \"Random but adaptive genetic mutation\" some 80 years ago. To say nothing of Darwin's discredited \"NS\" some 150 years ago.\n\n \n You can take a horse to water.....\n \n You have chosen to ignore the evidence that has been put forward. You haven't proposed anything that explains the data better. You fundamentally refuse to even look at the possibility you may have got something wrong, and you accuse me of being blindfolded.\n \n \nI'm not the one playing games with a good English word. You people are responsible for corrupting its meaning to suit your metaphysic. Next you'll be telling us that falling rocks 'select' their landing places. Good grief!!\n\n \n I fail to see how the word good applies to selection. The word selection only implies that a choice is made between 2 or more alternatives. It says nothing about the chooser. It does not suggest there has to be some sort of intelligence or Vitality driven Genome Ordering Drive to make a selection. It merely shows that of two available routes, one has been followed,\n \n \nBut whether you like it or not, as I said earlier, it does impact social behaviour. Spencer's \"social darwinism\", laissez-faire capitalism, marxism, libertarianism, elitist politics (fascism, of course, but also including so-called, \"representative\", democracy and the \"party\" system), behaviourism, sociobiology and evolutionary psychology in human behaviour, but most of all, for 150 years, it has been the keystone idea rationalising atheism and materialism, with its attendent consumerism.\n\n \n The US, founded as a representative republic 200 years ago, rather before Darwin's theories. UK, founded as a monarchy, then transmuted into a parliamentary democracy (rule by party) some time in the 1500's (I'm ashamed I don't know the date). The idea of rule by a small elite group stretches back to the dawn of humanity. In fact, elitism, or alpha rule, is probably the original state of human society....\n \n Modern materialism and consumerism are outgrowths of the fact that rich people owned a lot and poor people didn't, and nowadays there are no where near as many poor people. Humans have been materialistic since the Bronze Age (burial with grave goods).\n \n Here's where we begin to wonder. Why should the fact that atheism is on the rise be mentioned in such a negative way? Hmmmmmm. Maybe you are correct, and people are seizing on the ToE as a means to justify their atheism, or as a means to explain themselves in an atheistic light. So what? That's not what the ToE talks about. The ToE merely talks about the development of life through advantageous and detrimental mutation within an environment. As yet, you haven't come up with anything better.\n \n \nI pointed out that this ancient point of view, this rationalization for elitism, chauvinism, and inhuman cruelty of man towards his fellowman, this \"selection\", goes all the way back and beyond the \"chosen people\" myth and their ethnic cleansing of the Canaanites.

Darwin's 'idea' was just the same old evil, but this time wearing a stolen lab coat so as to look like something modern and different.\n\n \n Actually, you didn't try to point anything out. You just tried to take a swipe at the theory. Are you seriously, seriously trying to claim that the ToE is responsible for the war between the Muslims and the Jews in Palestine? I'll give you a moment to think about that before I fall off my chair laughing. \n \n You also seem to be blaming the fact that mankind is cruel on the ToE. Given that mankind was cruel a long, long time before the ToE, have you considered that maybe, just maybe, the ToE might be a partial explanation of why we're cruel, rather than a reason for it...",

You people, in particular, peeling, started losing, and became frustrated that your old tried and true semantic tricks had no effect on my insistance upon semantic honesty.\n \n \n\n You then threw insults (see post 142).\n\n \n **\n All of you, including peeling, (although him not nearly so much as you others), resorted to 'ad hominem' long before I responded in kind. I finally stopped trying to deal with peeling once his frustration at getting his XXX handed to him every day got the better of his intellect and he unapologetically switched to the same sophistic, dishonest, and insulting garbage you people produce as a matter of course.\n \n \n\n I called you on that, so you've decided that you will try to use condescension to get out of it.\n\n \n **\n You \"called\" me on nothing. All you did was concoct an accusation that frames events the way you want them to be seen.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n No doubt you could, but again I ask you, what's your point. Did you mistake me for an apologist for the abrahamic religions?!?! You really shouldn't attack someone out of your own ignorance of their position. \n \n \n This I like. I responded in kind to your post, and you ask what my point is. You tried a bit of mud slinging and you got called on it.\n\n \n **\n Garbage. Mud-slinging isn't \"mud-slinging\" when it's a pertinent, albeit shameful, truth.\n \n \n\n Grow up. \n\n \n **\n This from a schoolboy mentality, would you believe?!?!\n \n \n\n I'm not asking you to apologise, but given that you are clearly not a scientist, it seems logical that you have a religious bent in all this, and it's not a huge leap of logic to deduce Abrahamic sympathies...\n\n \n **\n So, by your fallacy, any poster to this forum is either--\n A/ a \"creationist\"(meaning, in your lingo, a right-wing evangelist fundamentalist abrahamic 'true-believer', or--\n B/a \"darwinist\" (you people are too bigoted to know the difference, so you'd probably say 'evolutionist\". IAC, a true-believer in the notion that evolution is caused by RMNS, plus 'a few minor tag-ons' that actual empirical science has forced to incorporate into your metaphysical canon over the past 40-odd years.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Don't try that cop-out. Science, as empiricism and inductive reasoning, has had an enormous effect upon philosophy in all its aspects, including ethics, ever since the Reformation and the decline of deductive reasoning. It is the responsibility of scientists to speak out when their theories are used to justify social behaviours, and not to simply wave it off as non-scientists committing the naturalist fallacy, and so none of their intellectual and moral responsibility to correct misinterpretation of their findings. \n \n \n So you argue that scientists have responsibility for their ideas, and that's fine. However, when that idea is taken and wrongly used to achieve an end, or to justify an action, how much clout does a scientist have?\n\n \n **\n Depending upon their status both in their own academic world and the public eye, either a lot or a little, individually--much more collectively, speaking with one voice. The exact same as for religious leaders and religious adherents, other philosophers, politicians, celebrities and NGO's.\n \n The historical fact fact is that in nazi Germany was that the vast majority of teutonic biologists, but not other scientists, publicly favoured Hitler's eugenics and 'ethnic cleansing' from the 'aryan reich' of jews and gypsies. It was but a short hop from that to mass murder of socialists, communists, and anyone else that didn't buy into his elitist/fascist/rascist (nazi) notions.\n \n The other historical fact is that Hitler got his sordid ideas from the N. American example of practiced eugenics that was promoted openly by darwinists, many of them with solid credentials in biology, prior to WWII, (albeit many just in population genetics, which is more 'bean-counting' than biology, but never mind--they were very much darwinists, and think themselves biologists).\n \n \n\n I'd also like to know if you hold the same for religious leaders....\n\n \n **\n As above, of course. And also for anyone else, from myself to a Hollywood celebrity. We all have duty to shout out loud and long against man's inhumanity to man, no matter who is doing what to whom. The leaders of the perpetrators are those whose responsibilty is most heavy--be they biologists, imams, popes, TV preachers, rabbis, published atheists, or moral and political pundits of any kind.\n \n But in this case we're talking about german and american and british biologists in the 20's and 30's, during Hitler's rise to power, and there moral failure and blame is blatantly obvious to anyone without a darwinist axe to grind.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n More to the point, the darwinian notion, (natural selection), of subtracting the 'common' from the 'noble', the 'best' from the 'ordinary', the 'elite' from everyone else, dates back to pre-history and the beginnings of agriculture. It is in fact the foundation of the notion of 'the elect', (or 'select'),in the calvinist tradition of 'salvation' out of which Darwin's big idea was carved. \n \n \n So now Darwin's theories are merely revisionist religion? Is that the point you are making?\n\n \n **\n Yup. At base, no more than mystic pseudo-scientific animism substituted for abrahamic anthropomorphic theism \n \n \n\n Surely recognition that nature has animals that do better than others merely adds weight to the theory of natural selection,\n\n \n **\n That \"recognition\" has been around since someone first wrote, \"The struggle is not always to the strong, nor the race to the swift\", meaning that the brute fact that some individuals and populations do better in the survive, thrive, repopulate game than others was first recognised by organisms long before the first proto-human ever set foot on an african savannah. All predators are damn good at distinguishing the weak from the strong--they have to be. Darwin was probably the one-billioneth homo sapiens to pick up on it, but you think that makes him a genius!\n \n \n\n by suggesting that some animals are better adapted than others....\n\n \n **\n Not when \"adapted\" is simply stating the above 'recognition' another way. Concocting a tautology for a truism doesn't take 'genius' in my book. Rather, it takes a very special kind fatuous, egostistic stupidity.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n He came to think so, and much repented himself of it. So much so that the yanks put him on trial for his regrets. \n \n \n So they did, but they tried him for communism. My question wasn't 'was he responsible for the atomic bomb', but rather, 'was he responsible for the decision to drop it on two heavily populated areas, when dropping it on an island near Japan may well have worked?'\n\n \n **\n Oh, please, don't play that game!! Guys as bright as Oppenheimer know what is intended to be done with the stuff they say and do.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Certainly depends on your god, doesn't it? \n \n \n There's something snide in this, which I can't pin down.\n\n \n **\n Not snide. Subtle. \n \n [quote]\n Quote:\n Actually, your \"ToE\" remains scientifically unsupported and unvalidated ever since Fisher and Haldane dreampt up \"Random but adaptive genetic mutation\" some 80 years ago. To say nothing of Darwin's discredited \"NS\" some 150 years ago. \n \n \n\n You can take a horse to water.....\n\n \n \n **\n I guess this must be one of your so-called \"points\". Am I right?\n \n \n\n You have chosen to ignore the evidence that has been put forward. \n\n \n **\n You people have put no evidence forward, with the supposed exception of peeling's commentary on the L&D '43 fluctuation test, which, as I pointed out, is dismissable on the grounds that modern microbiology sees eusocial bacteria in an entierely different light from how they were seen prior to the 80's. I never had a chance to answer his post on that in detail because he kept reiterating the same specious claims and bringing up fresh red-herrings that I had to rip up first. That frutrated him so much that he stooped below the usual run of adhominem and called me a liar. At that point I realised that he was no better than the rest of you, and dropped him.\n \n \n\n You haven't proposed anything that explains the data better. \n\n \n **\n I most certainly have so done!! You simply choose to pretend to yourself that I have not.\n \n \n\n You fundamentally refuse to even look at the possibility you may have got something wrong, and you accuse me of being blindfolded.\n\n \n **\n On Socrates advice, and even before I heard of him, I've been reexaming my basic beliefs. I started at twelve by dropping organised religious beliefs. I continued at thirty by dropping Darwinism. At thirty-five, existentialism. For 20 years I re-examined philosophy, including cosmology, looking for something that made sense. Eventually I settled on the 'Process Philosophy' begun by Heraclitus and rejuvenated by Alfred North Whitehead. I was also influenced by Pierce's semiotics. All of this correlated better and better with 20th century physics and biology than did the 19th century economic and political principles that Darwinian theory is based upon.\n \n I still review my own positions on a regular basis, and every once in a blue moon I encounter another thinker on one of these discussion boards who challenges me. It is not happening nearly as often as it used to do, since 99.9% of the stuff offered by indoctrinated darwinists is just the same ol' recycled same ol'. Boring metaphysical tripe.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n I'm not the one playing games with a good English word. You people are responsible for corrupting its meaning to suit your metaphysic. Next you'll be telling us that falling rocks 'select' their landing places. Good grief!! \n \n \n I fail to see how the word good applies to selection. The word selection only implies that a choice is made between 2 or more alternatives. It says nothing about the chooser. \n\n \n **\n Of course it does!! It entails a \"chooser\" who possesses those qualities that enable the acts of recognising, discriminating between, making a criterion-guided value judgement, and dynamically acting upon it. All qualities that, here on earth, only belong to real, live, organisms, or human artefacts. Abstractions and bits of stuff just can't cut it.\n \n \n \n\n It does not suggest there has to be some sort of intelligence or Vitality driven Genome Ordering Drive to make a [genetic or organismic] selection.\n\n \n **\n Of course it does! Are you out of your mind?!?!\n \n \n\n It merely shows that of two available routes, one has been followed,\n\n \n **\n That's not \"selection\". That's simply \"separation\". You really need to get a better grip on the English language. Things 'separate', 'divide', and 'differ' , 'alter', 'vary' and simply 'carry on', all the time, without any 'selection' involved whatsoever. You must be one of those who claim that falling rocks 'select' their landing places, right? \n \n \n \n\n The idea of rule by a small elite group stretches back to the dawn of humanity. In fact, elitism, or alpha rule, is probably the original state of human society....\n\n \n **\n Spoken like a true darwinist. Thanks for making my point for me.\n \n \n\n Modern materialism and consumerism are outgrowths of the fact that rich people owned a lot and poor people didn't, and nowadays there are no where near as many poor people. Humans have been materialistic since the Bronze Age (burial with grave goods).\n\n \n **\n Maybe not in your suburban world.\n \n \n\n Here's where we begin to wonder. Why should the fact that atheism is on the rise be mentioned in such a negative way? Hmmmmmm. Maybe you are correct, and people are seizing on the ToE as a means to justify their atheism, or as a means to explain themselves in an atheistic light. So what? \n\n \n **\n So what!?!?\n \n \n\n That's not what the ToE talks about. The ToE merely talks about the development of life through advantageous and detrimental mutation within an environment. As yet, you haven't come up with anything better.\n\n \n **\n Actually, it is not, \"the\" ToE, it's the darwinian ToE. But you guys are too arrogant to admit that. And I have come up with something better, from a scientific POV. It wasn't at all difficult to top darwinism, which is strictly pseudo-scientific metaphysics anyway. I've gone back to Lamarck, the Dynamists, and the Vitalists, connected their dots with that of modern evolutionary biology, the fossil record, etc., and proposed an alternative explanation for the fact of evolution that beats the darwinian 19th century wind-up toy mechanical model hands down. For sake of a name, I call it Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis.\n \n \n\n Actually, you didn't try to point anything out. You just tried to take a swipe at the theory. \n\n \n **\n That's how you see it, of course. Anything that does not glorify your \"theory\" is simply a \"swipe at it\".\n \n \n\n Are you seriously, seriously trying to claim that the ToE is responsible for the war between the Muslims and the Jews in Palestine? I'll give you a moment to think about that before I fall off my chair laughing. \n\n \n **\n That you should be so thick or prejudiced as to make that interpretation has me shaking my head in pity for your inadequacies. But the fact remains that Darwinism is not that far removed from Zionism, and all other forms of ethnic and religious elitism. As I really pointed out, but you missed, is that darwinism springs from the same ideational root that gave us nazism and zionism. Not to mention black slavery, heretic burning, and on and on.\n \n [quote]\n You also seem to be blaming the fact that mankind is cruel on the ToE. Given that mankind was cruel a long, long time before the ToE, have you considered that maybe, just maybe, the ToE might be a partial explanation of why we're cruel, rather than a reason for it...[quote]\n \n **\n The cruelty has long roots, and those roots also produced darwinism, the 'survival of the fittest', and so forth. Darwinism does not \"explain\" the evil in human behaviour, but it very often tries to rationalise it, to make it look 'natural', even 'genetically predetermined' and inevitable. Nobody has to resist it, nobody has to be sorry for it, 'it's just the way it is '. \"It just 'happens', that's all!\". Pernicious garbage.",

   "You evidently consider yourself an enlightened person. You seem to believe that you are better at everything than I. In fact you're so much better at it that you can only respond with sneers and insults (I'd ask for an apology, but you're probably too self-righteous to offer one). I'd like to see you submit exactly what you think I am, seeing as how you know me so well... Post it. You claim to have utterly summed me up, so prove it. It'd be interesting to see.\n \n You posted a 3 line swipe (and I call it a swipe because it: a) contained no pertinent facts, b) had little relevancy to the discussion and c) was only posted to attempt to put the ToE in a bad light), and I actually decided to call you on that. You evidently don't like it when someone takes exception to your bombastic approach.\n \n \nIf I wasn't, in fact, extremely good at it, your bunch wouldn't have gone into hysterics, bad-mouthing me and cawing to each other in a group hissy-fit.\n\n \n Actually if you'd been good at it, you'd have convinced people like me, who do question the world around them. Science involves questioning theories. Tell me what predictions your theory makes that can be tested for experimentally. List them clearly and I will certainly investigate them.\n \n \n...he unapologetically switched to the same sophistic, dishonest, and insulting garbage you people produce as a matter of course.\n\n \n Thus answers the unbiased and great philosopher....\n \n \nGarbage. Mud-slinging isn't \"mud-slinging\" when it's a pertinent, albeit shameful, truth.\n\n \n And the proof of this is? Please prove the direct links between the ToE and all the 4 points that I showed were not connected to the ToE.\n \n \nThis from a schoolboy mentality, would you believe?!?!\n\n \n I'm not the one blowing a vessel over being accused of being full of rubbish. If your theory had backing you'd have offered some real evidence for it by now, rather than nothing claims and hand waving. Your response to being challenged (by me, who hasn't got involved with this before) is to attack me, and to scream that scientists are all involved in a conspiracy. Not really the most mature response....\n \n \nSo, by your fallacy, any poster to this forum is either--\n A/ a \"creationist\"(meaning, in your lingo, a right-wing evangelist fundamentalist abrahamic 'true-believer', or--\n B/a \"darwinist\" (you people are too bigoted to know the difference, so you'd probably say 'evolutionist\". IAC, a true-believer in the notion that evolution is caused by RMNS, plus 'a few minor tag-ons' that actual empirical science has forced to incorporate into your metaphysical canon over the past 40-odd years.\n\n \n Actually that's the product of experience on this forum. It's kinda logical that posters on a Creationism/Evolution website will either have a religious or a scientific background. In your case I was wrong, and for that I apologise. Please note I said you seemed to have religious tendencies. I never said you were a fundy. \n \n I like the way you're so good at English that you've tried to sum up what these words mean to me. I was having great difficulty by myself. FYI, I don't really know or care what background or political position people on this forum have. I merely debate the points they raise, rather than trying to attack them. I also don't refer to people as Darwinists or Evolutionists. I'll describe someone as agreeing with the ToE, but there is no '-ist' position.\n \n \nThe other historical fact is that Hitler got his sordid ideas from the N. American example of practiced eugenics that was promoted openly by darwinists, many of them with solid credentials in biology, prior to WWII, (albeit many just in population genetics, which is more 'bean-counting' than biology, but never mind--they were very much darwinists, and think themselves biologists).\n\n \n And from this, you expect to blame modern evolutionary scientists? When does the blame stop? You'll note that Hitler himself blamed the Jews for the state of Germany after WWI, and claimed the Treaty of Versailles was a Jewish plot. I doubt he believed that because some American scientists believed in culling the unfit (which is a really bad idea, as it can do massive damage to genetic diversity).\n \n \nBut in this case we're talking about german and american and british biologists in the 20's and 30's, during Hitler's rise to power, and there moral failure and blame is blatantly obvious to anyone without a darwinist axe to grind.\n\n \n Actually I think the people most responsible are the politicians who allowed Hitler's party to rise that high. That wasn't really Germany's fault, as the American recession had sent them out of control. Britain, America and France should have stopped Hitler before he started, however we didn't, and the rest is history.\n \n \n Yup. At base, no more than mystic pseudo-scientific animism substituted for abrahamic anthropomorphic theism \n\n \n Unlike Vitality, the ToE has been tested according to the principles and practises of modern science. It is therefore not pseudo-science. Given that the principles under which it works are clearly stated, and the subject of continual analysis, it's hardly mystic. If you believe it's a religion, then there's no way to convince you otherwise, because belief is immaterial of evidence. It's not one, but you refuse to accept that.\n \n \n Darwin was probably the one-billioneth homo sapiens to pick up on it, but you think that makes him a genius! \n\n \n Again I love the presumption of you speaking for me. Darwin hardly came up with this on his own. You should know that Wallace also arrived at the same conclusions, from completely different evidence. So are you now going to argue that they were both wallowing in pseudo-science? Or is it merely another conspiracy? I personally think Darwin was intelligent. I don't know if genius is correct, as I don't know if he was in the league with Newton, Einstein or Stephen Hawking. Surely the fact that he recognised the pattern in front of him when next to no-one else had means he was intelligent.\n \n \n Not when \"adapted\" is simply stating the above 'recognition' another way. Concocting a tautology for a truism doesn't take 'genius' in my book. Rather, it takes a very special kind fatuous, egostistic stupidity. \n\n \n So someone is stupid for noticing something about nature that no-one else had managed to recognise? Also, the word adaptation here refers to populations of animals (that being the level at which the ToE works), so your point about predators being able to spot the young, sick or weak is moot.\n \n \n Oh, please, don't play that game!! Guys as bright as Oppenheimer know what is intended to be done with the stuff they say and do. \n\n \n Game? I'm trying to make a point, one that you seem unable to grasp. Oppenheimer knew he was making a bomb. He knew that this bomb could kill thousands if used on an inhabited area. In what way does that make him responsible for the decision to use it? That's like arguing Faraday should have stopped mucking about with electricity because it could hurt someone. Oppenheimer (as far as I am aware) primarily wanted to use fission to produce cheap power, and the Manhattan project was the only way to get the funding. He may have argued strenuously against its use on Hiroshima, but we'll never know, as the public weren't consulted. The responsibility for that decision purely rests in the hands of the Joint Chiefs who opted to use it in that way. Hardly Oppenheimer's fault. You'll look like a more reasonable person if you try to debate rather than dismiss.\n \n \n Not snide. Subtle. \n\n \n Evidently so subtle as to be non-existent\n \n \n I guess this must be one of your so-called \"points\". Am I right? \n\n \n More an expression of frustration at your repeated refusal to offer something meaningful in opposition to the data presented to you\n \n \n At that point I realised that he was no better than the rest of you, and dropped him. \n\n \n This makes me wonder how you can consider yourself a philosopher. If you truly had something, you'd ignore the 'bashing' and post your data so everyone could decide if you were correct. Instead you've just gone off attacking everyone (including me who hasn't actually discussed this issue with you yet), and deciding that 'we' are all against you. Hardly the response of a mature adult\n \n \n I most certainly have so done!! You simply choose to pretend to yourself that I have not. \n\n \n I simply haven't seen you answer the questions posed of your idea. That's that. If you could answer them, then your idea might have been worth further investigation, however as you've run to ad homs and insults, it seems likely that you've not got much to say. \n \n \n I still review my own positions on a regular basis, and every once in a blue moon I encounter another thinker on one of these discussion boards who challenges me. \n\n \n Good, people should challenge their own beliefs. They should fight becoming stuck in the same ideas purely for habit, or from sloppy thinking. However they should not be afraid of staying with an idea if it seems correct. The ToE seems to be the most accurate description of the processes seen in the natural world. Maybe there is a better, more accurate theory, but it's not here yet, and as a scientist, the data supports the ToE more than any other proposal.\n \n \n Of course it does!! It entails a \"chooser\" who possesses those qualities that enable the acts of recognising, discriminating between, making a criterion-guided value judgement, and dynamically acting upon it.\n\n \n Natural Selection. The phrase indicates that the selection is being done by the natural environment. Is there something incredibly complicated about that? There is no indication of a guiding intelligence. The only time intelligence is involved in selection is in artificial selection, where humans control breeding patterns. Would you prefer 'environmental determination'? How about 'genetic profile change due to differential reproduction rates'. Or maybe 'genome alteration due to environmentally cued mortalities and resultant affects on offspring production'. Those three don't have the word selection (which is where your problem seems to lie), but mean essentially the same thing.\n \n Is this a good time to remind you that the phrase 'natural selection' was deemed to be a mistake at the time it was written?\n \n \n Of course it does! Are you out of your mind?!?! \n\n \n Not as far as I can tell. As described above, the phrase indicates that selection is made by the environment, with no 'human-like' mind involved.\n \n \n That's not \"selection\". That's simply \"separation\". You really need to get a better grip on the English language. \n\n \n I've got a good enough grip to look at the word in context. Given that I look at the theory rather than take issue with the label, this seems a bit petty to me.\n \n Example: Take a die. Roll it. You will generate a number between 1 and 6 that is random. Now, make small but random alterations to the surface of that die. Over time, more and more alterations will begin to affect the outcome of the rolls, until you reach a point where the dice begins to land on one or two numbers only. Take the numbers to stand for the expressed phenotype of an animal, and the small but random alterations to represent the environmental pressures. Overtime environmental conditions force an undirected change in the expressed phenotype. The change is undirected (due to the randomness of the alterations) but is still being selected for by the alterations in the surface of the die. \n \n \n You must be one of those who claim that falling rocks 'select' their landing places, right? \n\n \n Rock rolling down hill. Hillside develops 2 gradients, one steeper than the other. If there are no other constraints, the rock will travel down the steeper gradient. (Physics) The steeper gradient has been selected with no intelligent selection...\n \n \n Spoken like a true darwinist. Thanks for making my point for me \n\n \n I actually developed that idea by observing nature. Alpha rule is very common in predator and omnivore society, as is combat between individuals for dominance. I thought of that long before Darwin made any impact on me.\n \n \n Maybe not in your suburban world. \n\n \n a) I don't live in the suburbs\n b) Consumerism is an issue affecting the 'first-world' countries, and they have a lot less issue with poverty than they used to. I was not including the 'third-world' countries in that comment.\n \n \n So what!?!? \n\n \n That was my question, given that you seemed determined to link the ToE to the spread of atheism....\n \n \n That's how you see it, of course. Anything that does not glorify your \"theory\" is simply a \"swipe at it\".\n\n \n See second paragraph\n \n \n That you should be so thick or prejudiced as to make that interpretation has me shaking my head in pity for your inadequacies. \n\n \n I appreciate both your pity, and your condescension. I'm sure you can accurately sum me up from wherever it is that you're posting. Besides assuming that you had a religious bent, I've not really made any attempt to sum you up yet, though you're hardly making a good case for yourself.\n \n \n As I really pointed out, but you missed, is that darwinism springs from the same ideational root that gave us nazism and zionism. Not to mention black slavery, heretic burning, and on and on. \n\n \n I didn't miss your insinuation, I just decided that it was tripe. Human society organises itself into hierarchies, normally by threat of force, and by simple human compliance. It did it long before Darwin, and would do it even if the ToE had never been propounded. The fact that Darwin made comments on the survival tendencies of animals in response to environmental pressure did nothing to influence that fact. Actually Darwin said little about how his theory related to anything but pure biology. Economic and philosophical implications were developed by others. The phrase 'Survival of the fittest' wasn't even one of his. Darwin actually said 'It is not the strongest of the species which survives, but the one most responsive to change'. Please show me how that springs from the ideological root of Zionism and Nazism.\n \n \n The cruelty has long roots, and those roots also produced darwinism, the 'survival of the fittest', and so forth. Darwinism does not \"explain\" the evil in human behaviour, but it very often tries to rationalise it, to make it look 'natural', even 'genetically predetermined' and inevitable. Nobody has to resist it, nobody has to be sorry for it, 'it's just the way it is '. \"It just 'happens', that's all!\". Pernicious garbage. \n\n \n Given that humans are animals and part of nature, human cruelty is natural. The idea that animals evolve in competition may serve as a partial reason why we are inclined to be cruel, but it hardly acts as a justification for it. Merely understanding why something like that occurs does not justify its occurrence. I understand that drinking a lot will get me drunk, therefore I don't drink a lot. I understand that my biological makeup means I can be a nasty SoaB at times, therefore I attempt to control that side of me. The ToE is hardly a shield for evil.\n \n Who do you want to be sorry for human cruelty? Unless you can render those who commit cruel actions remorseful, the feelings of the rest of the world hardly matter. And although you'll throw a cheap comment at this, some things do just happen. Without reason or explanation. The world isn't fair. (I advise we move back onto the ToE or carry this onto the Philosophy boards, as it'll only spiral off topic)",

A \"mutation\"\" is the actual change observed in the \"mutant\", (i.e., the organism itself).\n\n \n Damn.

It's a stretch, but yes, even extinction is evolution.\n \n If you'll permit me to tweak the example from sparrows to finches, then it's pretty clear flocks of finches can, do, and have evolved, as evidenced by the incongruous bouquets of finch speciation observed on remote islands.\n \n Why; are you saying populations of sparrows and deer don't experience changes in alelle frequency?

'Organisms' refers not just to a particular individual, but to bioforms, one form that may be exhibited in any number of individuals from one to a gazillion, or many, many forms that are remarkably different from each other. The one thing 'organisms' is not, is a \"population\", an abstract collectivity.\n \n \n\n Thanks to my unintentional slip, you have had to make my point (that changes to an individual organism are mutations, not evolution) for me.\n \n I'll try not to let it happen again. \n\n \n **\n I've never claimed that organismic evolution occurred in a single organism's lifespan. Please don't try to put that one on me.

String a lot of them together, though, and the music/movie/process is revealed.\n\n \n Beside the point. Your claim does not stipulate numbers or quantities.

That was your misinterpretation of what I actually did say, as gone over, above. Funny thing, following the way you do business, I could now legitimately accuse you of \"lying\". But I won't.\n \n \n\n Anyway, logically, a solitary moose can't breed, so the 'evolution' of that population is pretty likely to be '-1' to the frequency of all alelles. It's a stretch, but yes, even extinction is evolution.\n\n \n **\n Well, in the case of a solitary moose, munching his water lilies far from the madding crowd of other 'meeses' :), the corect word is death, as in some hunter shot him while his alleles were busy fluctuating, that is, in your terms, as he was evolving. So now you claim \"death\" as evolution, along with \"extinction\" do you? BTW, 'extinction' is an aspect of the evolution of ecosystems and their included populations, not an instance of organismic evolution. IOW, \"extinction\" is to numerical statistics what death is to biological organisms.\n \n \n\n If you'll permit me to tweak the example from sparrows to finches, then it's pretty clear flocks of finches can, do, and have evolved, as evidenced by the incongruous bouquets of finch speciation observed on remote islands.\n\n \n **\n Nobody here is denying the fact of evolution, only the question of what mechanism generates it.\n \n \n\n Why; are you saying populations of sparrows and deer don't experience changes in alelle frequency? Why them, specifically?\n\n \n **\n I honestly have no idea where you are geting this from?!!? I've just finished saying that all living organisms, and probably all dead ones as well, are perpetually experiencing allelic changes, if for no other reason than that the quick and the dead are constantly dealing with entropic accidents, like radiation. So what are you on about?\n \n \n\n Quote:\n No, it's not, or we wouldn't be arguing about it.

   "It is unfair that you have the impression that I have \"never listened to, or read articles by, anyone other than creationists when forming my opinion of evolution.\" (Peeling)\nI have read all three of your posts to this board and I have the same impression. Please, cite some actual scientific sources that you have consulted.\n \nAccording to you (Peeling) \"The idea that the ToE states 'man evolved from monkeys', for example, is simply untrue; the only people who have ever said any such thing are, unfortunately, creationists,..\" This could not have been so, because the standard definition of creationism \"is the belief that all humanity, life, the Earth, or the universe as a whole was created by a supreme being (often referred to as God[1])\". Creationists believe in creationism.\nBut evolutionary biologists do not claim that man evolved from monkeys. That claim is only made by creationists who wish to misrepresent evolutionary theory. Such a statement is either ignorant or dishonest. What is it in your case?\n \nI do not need to be armed for any fight, because there is no fight. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion based on facts and figures. I am afraid that the \"Theory of Evolution\" is losing grounds.\nRight. Until you are asked to provide the facts and figures that support your faith, and then you have nothing.\n \nAccording to darwin's theory of evolution website (sorry I can't send a url either, to access it, put www, hyphens between each word, and then .com after 'evolution') \n \"Darwin's Theory of Evolution is a theory in crisis in light of the tremendous advances we've made in molecular biology, biochemistry and genetics over the past fifty years.

   "I don't think that's true. Please prove that it is so by quoting your exact statement of your true position [with post #], plus my exact statement misrepewesenting your given position statement [with post#], and if youi're right, I'll apologise, or explain my misunderstanding.\n\n \n Fair enough :)\n \n Here's me, describing Natural Selection as part of the process of evolution (as it is presently defined - I know you disagree with that definition, but that's quite beside the point; it's the definition I was employing when making my statements):\n \n \nNS is the accumulated statistical effect of generations of breeding.\n\n \n \nNS is not a conscious actor, it is, as I have said, merely the cumulative effect of the statistical influence of genes upon reproductive rates.\n\n \n \n<pretty much the whole first screenful of the post describes RM+NS, with RM being the origin of variant traits and NS being the filtering process that changes their frequency in the gene pool<\n\n \n \nHere is the claim NS makes:\n \n Alelles (or combinations thereof) conferring a reproductive advantage will tend to be passed on to more offspring than alelles that confer a reproductive disadvantage, and thus will tend to be found in a greater proportion of organisms in each successive generation.\n\n \n Now, here's you edging in your alternative meaning of the word evolution. Note that you explicitly acknowledge that it differs from the Darwinist definition. Given that you know I accept Darwin's theory, it follows that you know I subscribe to the 'official' definition of the word and have been making statements in that context. Several times you even explicitly acknowledge your understanding of what I'm saying:\n \n \nwhat darwinists call evolution by RM+NS is really derived from the genetic theory of inheritance, which is about how traits are conserved and expressed over generations, and not evolution, which is about how traits change, alter, and originate\n\n \n \nEvolution is about the origin of traits, not their after effects.\n\n \n \nSo now you're saying that \"NS\" is purely a statistical effect (i.e., numerical change in the differential distribution of various physical traits) as a result of organismic change, that is to say, evolution?\n\n \n \nWhat is? \"NS\"? So are you admitting that \"NS\" is only an after effect of, not a mechanism for, evolution?\n\n \n This is the pivotal post, where you most explicitly outline your unofficial definition of the word 'evolution'. It is also the first time you imply that I'm claiming NS originates new traits:\n \n \nThe point is that the _distribution_ of a given inherited trait, expanding or contracting statistically within a population, is not the _evolution_ of that trait. <Note: yes, it is; that's the official definition of the word< It is, at most, an ecological effect of the origination, the evolution, of that trait in the first place. The issue is wrt 'origins', the arising of novelty and, sometimes, increased complexity. The statistical distribution of this novelty throughout a population is not the cause of its existence, but at most, the effect of its existance. \"NS\" cannot generate original traits\n\n \n In this post you solidify that implication:\n \n \nOnce again, here are my opinions on \"Natural Selection\".\n \n 1/ \"NS\" is not a causal mechanism for evolution, (i.e., origins), and merely insisting that it is, does not make it so.\n\n \n And here you explicitly claim that I have been saying origination (mutation, in the Darwinian context) is the same as distribution (NS in the Darwinian context):\n \n \nBut origination and distribution are still not the same thing, no matter how loud you holler.\n\n \n Is that a satisfactory explanation?\n \n \nBTW, when are you, a population geneticist, going to learn how to spell, \"allele\"? In your every post you mispell the word as \"alelle\". Doesn't inspire confidence in your credentials.\n\n \n Whoops! In my defence, I wasn't sure of which way round it was, and googled 'alelle' first. The genetics-related links that popped up convinced me I'd got it right first time. Thanks for correcting me!\n \n \nI've never claimed that organismic evolution occurred in a single organism's lifespan. Please don't try to put that one on me. What I did say was that evolution occurred in organisms over generations of them,\n\n \n First of all, what I'm trying to get you to see is that you're arguing this the wrong way round, and it's not helping your cause. You keep saying \"evolution occurs like this\", when you should (from the perspective of enlightening others and avoiding confusion) be saying \"We should call this evolution.\"\n \n Secondly, if evolution applies to organisms, but it doesn't happen in their individual lifetimes... when does it happen? You claim that in all cases stimulation leads to behavioural change, from there to morphological change, then epigenetic inheritance, then genetic change. These all sound like events happening within the lifetimes of organisms. Or is it only called evolution when all those steps have been followed? Please understand, I'm just trying to establish what you're actually saying the word 'evolution' should mean.\n \n \nJust so, my point exactly. Allelic change is no more 'evolution' than editing a film is filming a movie.\n\n \n Er, what? Where did you get 'editing' from? Or 'filming' from?\n \n In that analogy, a birth, death or mutation would be one note, or one frame of film; one little bit of evolution. Play all the notes, all the frames, and you see the process in action.\n \n \nBeside the point. Your claim does not stipulate numbers or quantities. It includes any allelic change as an instance of evolution. Read it for yourself. There are no arbitrary quantitative limits.\n\n \n If you 'read for yourself' my reply, I actually agreed that a single birth or death does constitute evolution - just not very much evolution.\n \n \nI don't, and never have, claimed that individual organisms evolve. That was your misinterpretation of what I actually did say, as gone over, above. Funny thing, following the way you do business, I could now legitimately accuse you of \"lying\". But I won't.\n\n \n Actually, you couldn't, because this is the first post you've ever actually said evolution doesn't occur within a single lifetime. My misinterpretation was just that - not an intentional misrepresentation.\n \n \nWell, in the case of a solitary moose, munching his water lilies far from the madding crowd of other 'meeses' :), the corect word is death, as in some hunter shot him while his alleles were busy fluctuating, that is, in your terms, as he was evolving.\n\n \n Where do you get this stuff? Is there some other thread somewhere I'm not following?\n \n What I said was, the death of a solitary moose is an 'evolution of the population'. I did not say, at any point, ever, that he's standing there with his 'alleles fluctuating'. You're just making rubbish up so you've got something to ridicule.\n \n \nSo now you claim \"death\" as evolution, along with \"extinction\" do you? BTW, 'extinction' is an aspect of the evolution of ecosystems and their included populations, not an instance of organismic evolution.\n\n \n Yet again, given the official definition, it is part of evolution. Try saying \"we shouldn't call it that\", not \"it isn't called that\"; it would really help.\n \n \nBut go ahead, as above, prove your accusation with quotes and post numbers.\n\n \n Done and done.",

He's saying \"Yes, I know it sounds impossible...\" \n \n What your source website omits is the overwhelmingly brilliant \"but\" that follows.\n \n In brief, he goes on to detail a possible sequence of gradual development, from light-sensing cells to a full-blown mammalian eye, each stage of which would confer progressively greater advantage.

Are you saying that darwinists such as yourself DO NOT repeatedly claim, indeed, pronounce as a diktat, that THE mechanism for \"evolution\" is \"RM + NS\"? That being so, how are you able to claim that your \"NS\", (i.e., #58\"NS is the accumulated statistical effect of generations of breeding\", and \"NS is not a conscious actor, it is, as I have said, merely the cumulative effect of the statistical influence of genes upon reproductive rates.\") is NOT a fundamental and essential piece of your hypothetical mechanism for 'evolution', itself? Particularly in view of the fact that neither \"RM\" nor \"NS\" can stand alone as THE mechanism for \"evolution\", by your [darwinists'] own admission? And when you then \"define\" _evolution_ itself as nothing more than exactly what you have just defined as \"Natural Selection\" as being? That is, as statistically differenetial allele fluctuations within a given population over time?!?\n \n If anyone needs to apologise to anyone, it is every darwinist who has ever employed this mendacious equivocation and pernicious 'double-speak', and that's every single one of them, including yourself.\n \n Added to which, the bit, \"the statistical influence of genes upon reproductive rates\", is pure presumption, since you have no evidence that genes have any influence upon reproductive rates, (which are at least partially a correlate of survival rates), _as a general rule_. Birth defects, 'hopeful monsters', {RM}, and universally impacting, abrupt, anomalous, and random catastrophes {NS},do not fit into the RM+NS hypothesis.\n \n Science is concerned with mechanisms, i.e., general/universal rules, not local and anomalous happenstance. Luck, as we like to call it. Therefore, under the 'natural conditions' required for your 'natural selection', there is absolutely no 'natural' evidence to the effect that 'genes' have any significant differential impact whatsoever upon which organism survives the longest, or reproduces the most. All wild studies of organisms in stable, non-catastrophic environments, show that all included organisms live, reproduce, and die, by the vagaries of pure chance.\n \n In sum, your accusation that I \"lied\", that is, deliberately distorted your stated position into a \"strawman\", is false. I could call it a \"lie\" on your part, but I'll assume it was simply a mistake \n \n \n\n Quote:\n \"I've never claimed that organismic evolution occurred in a single organism's lifespan. Please don't try to put that one on me. What I did say was that evolution occurred in organisms over generations of them, \"\n \n First of all, what I'm trying to get you to see is that you're arguing this the wrong way round, and it's not helping your cause. You keep saying \"evolution occurs like this\", when you should (from the perspective of enlightening others and avoiding confusion) be saying \"We should call this evolution.\"\n\n \n **\n But that is precisely what I have done and am continuing to do. That is, insisting that evolution _is_ the change in traits seen in _organisms_ over the passage of generations of them, and is not, as you guys claim, the numerical, arithmetical, quantitative changes that occur in the differential _statistics_ of particular genes within a local collectivity, at some local time compared to some other time in the past. If you wish to insist that that IS evolution, then at least have the honesty to admit that you are referring to the evolution of ecosystems, and not the evolution of organisms. Although into truth youy are really not talkining 'evolution' at all, but merely numerical differences.\n \n \n\n Secondly, if evolution applies to organisms, but it doesn't happen in their individual lifetimes... when does it happen? \n\n \n **\n As you well know, I'm sure, the word 'organism' has a different sense from the word 'organisms'. The former is singular, the latter, plural, but they both, qualitatively albeit not quantitatively, refer to the exact same thing. A single _organism_, here, a number of _organisms_, there. Evolution is a case of a process based upon the latter, not the former, word, since evolution, to be more than simple change, must cobntinue in an 'unfolding' process over generations. That is why 'mutation', per se, is not 'evolution', per se.\n \n Obviously organismic evolution happens as a process of trait change passing from one individual to another, originating in the 'parent' organisms' response to environmental stimuli, and then incorporated that response into their own reproduction system, with its effects carried on into, and expanded by, their 'offspring', during development. And in cases where the environment stimulus persists, becomes, chronic, the process is repeated until it becomes 'habitual', and the trait effects are then incorporated into the organisms' [general and particular sense] genetic inheritance coding.\n \n \n\n You claim that in all cases stimulation leads to behavioural change, from there to morphological change, then epigenetic inheritance, then genetic change. These all sound like events happening within the lifetimes of organisms.\n\n \n **\n Quite so. Just not one individual lifetime. The words \"epigenetic inheritance\" should have made that clear, since no one individual inherits anything from itself.\n \n \n\n Or is it only called evolution when all those steps have been followed? Please understand, I'm just trying to establish what you're actually saying the word 'evolution' should mean.\n\n \n **\n Once again, although darwinists never seem able to grasp the distinction, \"evolution\" and \"the mechanism for evolution, i.e., its causal explanation\" are two separate things. Above I gave you my definition of evolution and compared it to yours, i.e. 'evolution _is_ the change in traits seen in organisms over the passage of generations of them, and is not, as you guys claim, the numerical, arithmetical, quantitative changes that occur in the differential statistics of particular genes within a local collectivity, at some local time compared to some other time in the past.'\n \n That demonstrates our differing definitions of 'evolution'.\n \n Our differing 'definitions' of evolution's mechanism are--\n \n Yours:-- Random, accidental, entropic, genetic mutations that are only coincidentally, but regularly, adaptive when expressed in an organism that finds itself in an an abnormal environment to which it was not previously adapted, in terms of traits and abilities, leading to this abnormal environment as a \"cause\", that is, \"Natural Selection\", that acts dynamically to 'select' the luckily adapted from the remaining unlucky, 'all others', _and/or, equivocally,_ _to simply count and arithmetically correlate statistically the before and after numerical differences in collections of organisms and/or or in collections of genes. Please correct me if you can find fault with your position.\n \n Mine:-- Random, accidental, unpredictable environmental events cause previously well-adapted organisms, (plural), in in each of their separate beings, (singular), to respond to this disequilibrium between their ccircumstances and their traits. The usual pattern of response is to try to lessen the chronic state of disequilibrium and enhance their chances of survival, prosperity, and reproduction by changing their behaviour, internally and biochemically, or externally, in the motor sense. This alteration in behaviour, where successful or at least partially successful, is repeated, and the repetion effects morphology, immediately in the 'parent', and also epigenetically, through developmental evolution, in the 'offspring'. If and when equilibrium between environment and trait adaptedness is finally restored, (provided the novel environmental stimulus still persists), the novel morphological trait/s is/are incorporated into the organismic inheritance system, i.e., its genome. If the disequilibrium was only temporary the epigenetic development effects will have ceased, but of the organism's own accord and direction. \n \n That is, a whale becomes a whale, a bat a bat, a bird a bird, and a flower a flower, well before its genome has a word to say about it; that is, beyond, \"Oh, no, you can't do that!!\".\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Just so, my point exactly. Allelic change is no more 'evolution' than editing a film is filming a movie. \n \n \n Er, what? Where did you get 'editing' from? Or 'filming' from?\n\n \n \n **\n Your own stated analogy. Quote, \"Strictly correct, although akin to calling a single note 'music' or a single frame of film a 'movie'.\" \n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Beside the point. Your claim does not stipulate numbers or quantities. It includes any allelic change as an instance of evolution. Read it for yourself. There are no arbitrary quantitative limits. \n \n \n If you 'read for yourself' my reply, I actually agreed that a single birth or death does constitute evolution - just not very much evolution.\n\n \n **\n How does this connect to this statement of mine that you quote?!? Except in that they agree with one another, perfectly? The point I was making was that any allelic change, not just a mutational accident of birth, but all allelic changes in all things, living and dead, would, by your definition, constiture, \"evolution\" I.E., a rotting fish is undergoing evolution because the comparitive numbers of alleles in what remains of its corpse are changing.\n \n This keeps getting worse and worse, reductio ad absurdam.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n I don't, and never have, claimed that individual organisms evolve. That was your misinterpretation of what I actually did say, as gone over, above. Funny thing, following the way you do business, I could now legitimately accuse you of \"lying\". But I won't. \n \n \n Actually, you couldn't, because this is the first post you've ever actually said evolution doesn't occur within a single lifetime.\n\n \n **\n I have never said \"organism\" when I meant \"organisms\", nor \"organisms\" when I meant \"organism\". If you are unable to distinguish between singular and plural forms, that's your fault, and I should never have been forced to even mention it, let alone lay it all out for you!!\n \n \n \n\n My misinterpretation was just that - not an intentional misrepresentation.\n\n \n **\n Fine. But I didn't misrepresent you, intentionally or by mistake, so stop callinhg me a liar!!!!!\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Well, in the case of a solitary moose, munching his water lilies far from the madding crowd of other 'meeses' , the corect word is death, as in some hunter shot him while his alleles were busy fluctuating, that is, in your terms, as he was evolving. \n \n \n Where do you get this stuff?

   "Added to which, the bit, \"the statistical influence of genes upon reproductive rates\", is pure presumption, since you have no evidence that genes have any influence upon reproductive rates,\n\n \n On the contrary, the evidence is abundant. It is most easily observed when the variation in reproductive rates is large and the reproductive cycle short (eg bacteria in the presence of a toxin).\n \n \nthere is absolutely no 'natural' evidence to the effect that 'genes' have any significant differential impact whatsoever upon which organism survives the longest, or reproduces the most. All wild studies of organisms in stable, non-catastrophic environments, show that all included organisms live, reproduce, and die, by the vagaries of pure chance.\n\n \n There are several problems with this statement, on a number of levels.\n \n The first problem is that you're not substantiating your distinction between 'wild' and laboratory observations. The only difference I can think of is that a wild population is subject to uncontrolled external influences - it is less stable than an engineered laboratory environment. Given that adaptive mutations have been repeatedly observed to influence reproductive rates in extremely stable laboratory environments (including the yeast links to which I fear I shall never receive a substantive response), your assertion that adaptation does not occur in stable environments is false.\n \n The second problem, as I have already pointed out, is that you ignore the practical problems associated with extending statistical observations relating to billions of bacteria reproducing once every twenty minutes to a few hundred animals reproducing once a year. These are practical difficulties, not flaws in the principle.\n \n The third problem, which occurred to me since I last rebutted this same claim, is that these field studies are based on our assumptions of what would confer a reproductive advantage. Again, what is easy to extrapolate in a petri-dish might be counter-intuitive in a more complex, wild environment.\n \n The fourth problem is that you are unconsciously stating a tautology: what is a 'non-catastrophic' environment if not one where relative reproductive rates are (practically) indistinguishable? To put it another way: any study that does demonstrate gene-influenced differential reproductive rates within the practical time constraints of field work would, by your rules, concern a 'catastrophic' environment.\n \n The fifth problem, which is another hardy perennial you have thus far still failed to address, is that if, as you claim, genes have no effect on reproductive success, what's the point of Lamarckism? Why go to all the trouble of encoding behavioural, morphological changes in genes if it doesn't help?\n \n \nIn sum, your accusation that I \"lied\", that is, deliberately distorted your stated position into a \"strawman\", is false.\n\n \n Since your defence against that accusation remains that the definition of evolution 'should not be' the one in the context of which I made my statements, your 'sum' does not add up. You claimed I 'hollered' that origination is the same as distribution. Since I did not, and you demonstrated several times that you knew I did not, that was a lie.\n \n \nYours:-- Random, accidental, entropic, genetic mutations that are only coincidentally, but regularly, adaptive when expressed in an organism that finds itself in an an abnormal environment to which it was not previously adapted, in terms of traits and abilities, leading to this abnormal environment as a \"cause\", that is, \"Natural Selection\", that acts dynamically to 'select' the luckily adapted from the remaining unlucky, 'all others', _and/or, equivocally,_ _to simply count and arithmetically correlate statistically the before and after numerical differences in collections of organisms and/or or in collections of genes. Please correct me if you can find fault with your position.\n\n \n Random, accidental, genetic mutations, yes. On average entropic, yes. Individually, not necessarily entropic - as I've already clarified way, way back in this thread.\n \n \"abnormal environment to which it was not previously adapted\" is a tricksy little phrase. As I've shown, adaptation has been observed in stable environments. Does that mean the organisms were not previously adapted to that environment? Strictly speaking, yes, although nobody observing them at the time would have said so. Only in the context of their observed adaptive 'improvements' do they appear to have been 'not previously adapted' to that environment. Also - to my knowledge - inheritable mutations are present from conception, so using 'it' is inappropriate. 'Previous generations' or 'its peers' might be better.\n \n After that you did start to lose me a bit. 'Acting dynamically', 'count' - I'm not comfortable using those words to describe differential reproductive rates. It seems as if you're stuck on the idea that for DRR to 'work' - that is, for them to change the frequency of alelles in the gene pool, there must be something 'counting' them. Which is obviously not what I'm saying, so I'm going to have to lean towards disagreement.\n \n Perhaps I'm wrong, but you seem to be trying to nail RM+NS down a specific chronology or causal chain of events - rather like the one you claim for Lamarckism. This isn't really appropriate given the acknowledged random occurrence of mutation. For instance, based on observations of yeast, adaptive mutations (yielding improved reproductive rates) do occur in stable environments. Based on other observations, it's equally clear that in any sizeable population there are many, many variant alelles plentifully represented in the gene pool. When an environment is encountered in which one or more of these variants do better than the others, we call those traits adaptive. Note that relativism: do better than the others. They don't have to be perfectly adaptive; their success isn't measured against the environment but against each other.\n \n I think at least part of the obstacle to your comprehension is that you are demanding of RM what you would expect from Lamarckism: changes that are a match; a fit to a new environment - as specific as a key fitting a lock, or an answer satisfying a particular question - hence your incredulity that such could occur by chance. But a new environment usually isn't a question with a single specific, yes/no answer. When it almost is, as in the original Fluctuation Test experiments, we see pretty much what we would expect: only a lucky few mutants surviving out of billions. I say 'almost', because the adaptive mutation even in that extreme case is not a unique solution to that problem, it just happens to be a solution. But most of the time we don't see specific answers to specific questions. We see around us answers to the one question all environments inherently pose: \"Who does best?\"\n \n Look at whales and dolphins, for example - wouldn't you think living exclusively in salt water for a few million years counts as a 'chronic stimulus' to start breathing the stuff? Heck, they can't even drink it! Dolphins that don't catch enough food die of thirst before starvation can do them in. What we see when we look at aquatic mammals is the cumulative effect of asking who does best of a bunch of (if memory serves) hippo-like creatures millions of years ago. Millions of years of tiny changes, some doing better than others - and none of them ever answering the question \"How best to live and thrive in the sea?\", which would clearly involve being able to breathe it.\n \n As for your proposed definition of evolution, yes, that's pretty much how I understood it. It's just inconvenient that - although epigenetic inheritence does occur, and behaviour does induce morphological changes, and genes do change - you've joined these events up in the wrong order. Behaviour-induced morphological changes are made possible by gene sequences. I can pump iron and build muscle because that ability is encoded in my genes; if it were not, no amount of behavioural change could make me 'buff'. Epigenetic inheritence occurs when pre-existing chemically sensitive genes are chemically triggered within the offspring while still inside the parent. Genes first, ability second. \n \n \nYour own stated analogy. Quote, \"Strictly correct, although akin to calling a single note 'music' or a single frame of film a 'movie'.\" \n\n \n An analogy in which I did not mention editing or recording.\n \n Somewhat to your surprise, I expect, I agreed with your extrapolation of the official definition of 'evolution' (presumably intended at the time to make it sound ridiculous), in that a single death or birth represents evolution in action - just not very much evolution, just like a single note or a single frame of film is 'not very much' audio/visual entertainment. All three are processes involving a sequence of events; that is the common ground they share for the purpose of my analogy, nothing more.\n \n \n\"evolution\" I.E., a rotting fish is undergoing evolution because the comparitive numbers of alleles in what remains of its corpse are changing.\n\n \n You certainly do seem reduced to stating the absurd. \n \n How is 'the number of organisms in a population possessing a given variant allele' the same as 'the number of intact cells in a rotting fish'? Answer: not at all. You're just being silly now.\n \n \nFine. But I didn't misrepresent you, intentionally or by mistake, so stop callinhg me a liar!!!!!\n\n \n Yes you did. I've quoted the evidence and it is unequivocal. According to you, I 'hollered' that origination and distribution were the same thing. Given that I have repeatedly and consistently described RM as the origin of variant traits and NS as the process by which their distribution changes within the population, what you claimed is a lie. \n \n And speaking of lies:\n \n \nSo long as you keep writing it, I don't need to 'make it up', and won't.\n\n \n I have described evolution in terms of changing numbers of organisms in a population possessing a given trait. Here you are claiming I said a solitary moose 'stands there with his alleles varying'.",

Despite the modern facts of bacteriology that have made that view not only antique, but absurd. The only effects that toxins have upon eusocial bacteria colonies, that is, the reproductive organismic units involved, is that they either kill them, thus stopping their reproduction, or they do not, thus having no effect upon their reproduction. In order to demonstrate that the genes possessed by, for example, one e.coli colony, are statistically significant, in terms of organismic (i.e., colonial) reproduction, WRT another e. coli. colony, you would have to determine that the two colonies, in the face of an antibacterial toxin, showed marked differences in whole colony survival/reproduction, and that those differences, if there are any.And I'm betting that at the true, whole organism, eusocial colony level, there will not be any statistically meaningfull differences in survival/reproduction. That is, that either both colonies will be eradicated or neither will. But even if one colony were eradicated and the other not, you would still be the one having to prove that the surviving colony had survived because it had inherited a gene that the other colony had not inherited, as opposed to ep[igenetically finding a successful immune response to a the toxin, that is, enabled its own survival, by creating a gene for itself. In the latter, Lamarkian case, gene statistics would be dependent upon colonial survival and reproduction, rather than colonial reproduction being dependent upon gene statistics. Either way, you're beat.\n \n as another \"reductio ad absurdum\" , this time for your false and out-moded view of eusocial bacteria, your claim that individual bacteria cells depend upon their own individual genes (despite the fact that they are asexually reproducing genetic clones),which, (you metaphysically stipulate), have been 'accidentally' mutated, (in one or more individual cells), into some coincidentally adaptive mutant/s (mutated organisms), all based upon the outmoded belief that every bacteria cell is its own independent organism. Some of us, reading the current literature of the past two decades, know that that vie is false. Some of you, for reasons best known to yourselves, have yet to wake up and smell the coffee on that one. Thus, in terms of my reductio, you comparison of an e.coli or other eusocial bacteria organism in contact with a phage/toxin, thus creating a statistical differential between the individual cells that survive/reproduce in that eusocial colony, supposedly on the metaphysical theoretic basis that some of these clones \"must have been\" blessed by chance with a coincidentally adaptive gene mutation that enabled their own survival/reproduction, is akin to saying, absurdly, that a person's skin cell's exposure to sunlightlight, sunburn, and dead-skin loss, was an example of genes determining rates of skin-cell survival/reproduction, with each cell considered as an individual, independent organism. Thus ignoring that, so far as can be determined, a normal case of sunburn shows no empirically or statistically significant impact on a person's reproductive capacity, thanks to their individual genome. In fact, any case of sunburn apt to kill any normal human being, would be apt to kill every normal human being. (And albinoes are negative, not positive, in terms of adaptation.) Meaning that, (once again), it is the individual genes that are passively dependent upon organisms for their survival/reproduction, and NOT, as you people would have it, the individual organisms that are passively dependent upon distinctly aberrant genes for their survival/reproduction.\n \n Break time.",

   "\n Quote:[ww]\n there is absolutely no 'natural' evidence to the effect that 'genes' have any significant differential impact whatsoever upon which organism survives the longest, or reproduces the most. All wild studies of organisms in stable, non-catastrophic environments, show that all included organisms live, reproduce, and die, by the vagaries of pure chance. \n \n \n There are several problems with this statement, on a number of levels.\n \n The first problem is that you're not substantiating your distinction between 'wild' and laboratory observations.\n\n \n **\n ??!??\n \n \n\n The only difference I can think of is that a wild population is subject to uncontrolled external influences - it is less stable than an engineered laboratory environment.\n\n \n **\n But you don't think that that's important when talking about biological evolution, right? Duh.\n \n \n\n Given that adaptive mutations have been repeatedly observed to influence reproductive rates in extremely stable laboratory environments (including the yeast links to which I fear I shall never receive a substantive response),\n\n \n **\n Yeasts are also eusocial, AFAIK. And adaptive mutations are not at issue. The issue is that you assume that adaptive mutations are not organismically directed, but are as random and entropic as maladaptive/meaningless mutations. That metaphysical assumption is something that you have never substantiated empirically.\n As for the yeast links, I don't remember seeing any, but if you think that they make or support some assertion of yours, then quote the relevent bits here. I'm not interested in searching out what you may think is evidence to support your argument. You have to go get your own material and put in in your post, wherever applicable. Otherwise I'll quite cheerfully ignore your \"links\", thank-you very much. I've got my own work to do.\n \n \n\n your assertion that adaptation does not occur in stable environments is false.\n\n \n **\n Really?!? I say that your statement is false. A stable environment is static, and a static environment, being unchanged, presents nothing novel to which an organism must adapt itself. If an organism changes in a static environment, it is simply changing, not adapting, and in the case of change of an adapted organism in an unchanging environment to which it is adapted, that change is either _maladaptive_ or meaninglessly _trivial_. That is, a random accident, either seriously negative or, at best, inconsequential.\n \n \n\n The second problem, as I have already pointed out, is that you ignore the practical problems associated with extending statistical observations relating to billions of bacteria reproducing once every twenty minutes to a few hundred animals reproducing once a year. These are practical difficulties, not flaws in the principle.\n\n \n **\n No. The root problem, as I've been pointing out, over and over again, is that you still embrace the antique and obsolete notion that the individual cells of eusocial organisms, including eusocial bacteria, constitute independent organisms; when in fact the science of the past 25 years demonstrates that only the eusocial whole constitutes an independent organismic entity.\n \n \n\n The third problem, which occurred to me since I last rebutted this same claim,\n\n \n **\n You're prone to dreaming in technicolour, aren't you?! So far you've rebutted diddley-squat.\n \n \n\n is that these field studies are based on our assumptions of what would confer a reproductive advantage.\n\n \n **\n Of course!! What would be the purpose of claiming that certain traits (via the determinism of their genes/alleles) confer a reproductive advantage, (what you guys call, \"fitness\"), if you cannot, as per the scientific method, identify those traits ahead of time, especially those that are differentially distributed and distinct, so that you can make a prediction of your \"fitness\" outcomes, drawing a clear correlation between the traits identified and the differential reproduction stats expected and found between identified trait carriers? That's how science is supposed to be done, although you people, after decades of making statements you can never back up with the scientific method, would rather that the rest of us just forget about how real science is done, and just take your word for your assumptions.\n \n \n\n Again, what is easy to extrapolate in a petri-dish might be counter-intuitive in a more complex, wild environment.\n\n \n **\n Hey, forget \"counter-intuitive\". Stick with just plain false.\n \n \n\n The fourth problem is that you are unconsciously stating a tautology: what is a 'non-catastrophic' environment if not one where relative reproductive rates are (practically) indistinguishable?\n\n \n **\n There is no tautology, since I am providing cause and effect, not restating either a cause or an effect, or both, in different words but with the same meaning.\n A 'non-catastrophic environment', is not just another way of saying, 'relative reproductive rates'. You need to bone up on the word, \"tautology\". In logic it means a vacuous, meaningless statement, and cause/effect relations are never meaningless/vacuous.\n \n \n\n To put it another way: any study that does demonstrate gene-influenced differential reproductive rates within the practical time constraints of field work would, by your rules, concern a 'catastrophic' environment.\n\n \n **\n Absolutely not. First you have to demonstrate that any positive differential reproductive effect that is statistically significant is due to a genetic mutation, and not any other cause. Such as a pasha collecting nubile young lmaidens in his hareem, or a lucky young stallion who captures the mares after his bigger and stronger rivals kick each other to smithereeens. And on and on.\n \n Trouble with this is, as I've been saying, is that people and horses, being essentially the same genetically-speaking, only trivial variations in heredity will be spotted, but no adaptive evolution at all, under stable environmental conditions to which the population is already adapted.. \n \n \n\n The fifth problem, which is another hardy perennial you have thus far still failed to address, is that if, as you claim, genes have no effect on reproductive success, what's the point of Lamarckism?\n\n \n **\n I have never claimed that \"genes\" per se, never have any effect on reproductive success. I have said that 'reproductive success' is not evolution, merely numerical distribution of this one's inheritance compared to that one's, where the inherited genes are not vitally different from one individual to another, which they should never be in a commonly adapted population under stable environmental conditions. \n And I have said that entropically altered, (i.e., accidentally, randomly mutated) genes can have a negative impact on reproductive success, or maybe no significant effect at all, under any environmental conditions at all. \n \n At the same time, I have proposed that organisms faced with a robust novel environmental stimulus can responsively direct mutations at the organismic level that in turn may, over one or more generations, direct a corresponding non-accidental genetic mutation, as a part of the evolutionary process. But that that evolution is accomplished without regard for whether the new allele/gene/genotype becomes reproductively widely and plentifully distributed, or remains geographically and/or numerically limited. Distribution of alleles and whatnot is, for the 100th time, a separate issue from the evolution of original and adaptively significant variation, both phenotypically and genotypically speaking.\n \n EAM says that adaptive evolution can only take place when a robust, novel, environmental stimulus provokes an organismic response, and generally speaking, that sort of thing is either a generally catastrophic environmental change or a generally beneficial one. In either case, even if some few individuals already possess an anomalous and aberrant gene absent in the majority, (and that must be proven, not merely supposed after the fact),and the catastrophe is NOT randomly distributed, (i.e.,fortuitous, as in the case of time and place of a meteor impact, or a flash flood, or whatever), then that, too, would only be a lucky accident of birth, having nothing to do with evolution, but only inheritance, (i.e., variation). And that catastrophic change does not fall under the normal slow, gradual, accumulative uniformitarianism demanded by the \"random mutations contra 'selection'\" of darwinian evolution's supposed mechanism.\n \n What I have said, again and again, is that comparitive, relative, statistically differentiated distribution of alleles in a population has to do with the biometrics of inherited variations, but not evolution. OTH, Neo-Lamarkism, (that is, EAM), says that under stable environmental conditions, evolution does not occur in any non-trivial sense, and further, that in such circumstances, relative changes in gene reproduction may happen, but they are inconsequential WRT survival and reproduction, in any way that correlates to adaptedness. Rather that, as mentioned before, the changes in relative gene frequencies in these circumstances are merely the result of some factor having nothing to do with organismic adaptedness. Usually, just plain luck, good or bad.\n \n [quote]\n Why go to all the trouble of encoding behavioural, morphological changes in genes if it doesn't help?{/quote]\n \n **\n Of course it helps. That's what \"adaptive evolution\" is all about. But it only helps when help is needed, after a major environmental change, and not, as you people believe, thanks to countless accidental genetic mutations that happen all the time, and are just waiting for some unforseen environmental emergency when one of them can boldy step out of the shadows and, like Mighty Mouse, save the day for the entire organism, or even the entire species.\n \n This endlessly repeated blather of yours is getting as tedious as your pals' stuff in the other thread. All you people ever do is repeat your assertions and denials. You never argue a point, you never reason your way to a conclusion. I'm the only one here that does that, and this one-sidedness is getting old and boring.",

   "In order to demonstrate that the genes possessed by, for example, one e.coli colony, are statistically significant, in terms of organismic (i.e., colonial) reproduction, WRT another e. coli. colony, you would have to determine that the two colonies, in the face of an antibacterial toxin, showed marked differences in whole colony survival/reproduction, and that those differences, if there are any.\n\n \n I refer you, once again, to the Fluctuation Test:\n \n Part 1.\n \n Samples drawn directly from a large colony and immediately plated on phage toxin demonstrated a very low variance in survival rates - that is, more or less the same number of bacteria in each sample were able to survive the toxin.\n \n Bearing in mind that the original colony is in liquid suspension and stirred prior to the samples being taken, each sample therefore represents a random cross-section of the bacterial population within the flask.\n \n What does the low variance in survival rate between the samples imply? Answer: either an evenly distributed pre-existing mutation (Darwinian explanation) or an evenly distributed success rate in responding to the toxin (Lamarckian explanation).\n \n Part 2 \n \n Tiny samples of just a few cells are drawn from the same original large colony, and seperately cultured to the size of the samples taken in Part 1 (many millions of cell divisions) These cultures are then plated, in their entirety, on phage toxin\n \n Lamarckian prediction:\n \n As you yourself insist, successful response to the toxin should remain evenly distributed. The variance in survival rate between samples should remain low.\n \n Darwinian prediction:\n \n Given the very low survival rate observed in Part 1 (only one in a hundred million or so), and the tiny size of the samples in Part 2, even if the adaptive mutation is random (and therefore pre-existing in the population), it is very, very unlikely that we will actually catch one such bacteria in our initial samples - but if we do, the resistent bacteria will form a phenomenally high proportion of the final culture of that sample (millions of survivors). We don't expect to see this, but there's a chance we might.\n \n Based on observed survival rates, and if the Darwinian explanation is the correct one, the accidental adaptive mutation is calculated to occur once every hundred million or so cell divisions.\n \n Given the number of cell divisions involved in culturing the tiny samples in Part 2 to the size of the samples in Part 1, we would therefore expect this mutation to occur no more than once (and quite likely not at all) during that process.\n \n The number of surviving bacteria in each culture, however, will depend on when in the culturing process the random mutation occurred. If it happens early on, the final culture will contain many descendants inheriting the mutation. If it happens later, the final culture will contain very few resistant bacteria. If it does not happen at all, no bacteria will survive.\n \n The Darwinian prediction is therefore that most of the samples in Part 2 will produce few or no survivors, but that just a couple will 'hit the jackpot', with the mutation occurring earlier and leading to a much higher survival rate when plated on phage. In mathematical terms, the Darwinian prediction is that the variance will be very much higher.\n \n Observed Results: \n \n As predicted by the Darwinian model, many of the cultures in Part 2 - despite being of similar size to the samples plated in Part 1 - produced zero resistant bacteria. Several more produced very low numbers of resistant bacteria, while three produced much greater numbers of survivors than any of the samples in Part 1, in one case around 4 times as many. The variance in survival rate is enormously greater, and emphatically supportive of random, Darwinian mutation prior to exposure to the toxin.\n \n \nAnd I'm betting that at the true, whole organism, eusocial colony level, there will not be any statistically meaningfull differences in survival/reproduction. That is, that either both colonies will be eradicated or neither will.\n\n \n As you can see, you have lost your bet.\n \n \nBut even if one colony were eradicated and the other not, you would still be the one having to prove that the surviving colony had survived because it had inherited a gene that the other colony had not inherited, as opposed to ep[igenetically finding a successful immune response to a the toxin, that is, enabled its own survival, by creating a gene for itself.\n\n \n For one thing, the evidence for Darwinism is, as I have made clear above, not that one colony survived and another didn't, but that the different pattern of survival between the two sets of equal-sized colonies is only consistent with random mutation occurring during cell division.\n \n (You also have it slightly backward: the samples that exhibited similar survival rates were the ones in part 1, the ones that all did contain, at the moment of sampling, bacteria with the resistant gene. The samples that exhibited radically varying survival rates were the ones in part two, the ones that most likely did not contain (by virtue of their tiny size), at the moment of sampling, bacteria with the resistant gene.)\n \n For another, you have no evidence whatsoever to suggest that 1) the 'true, whole organism' is the colony, or 2) that immunity was a eusocially developed response.\n \n 1) A single bacterium can do everything an entity needs to do in order to be called an organism. Does a colony exhibit 'eusocial behaviour'? I'll take your word for it - but so what? So does my family, my town, my country. We don't call those the 'true, whole organism'; we call that society. As in eusocial.\n \n 2) Twenty or so survivors out of a few hundred million bacteria doesn't strike me as a terribly 'eusocial' response. Combine that with the different observations from parts 1 and 2 of the experiment, and one is forced to conclude that the 'society' of bacteria had nothing to do with how many of its members survived the toxin, just as our human society would have nothing to do with how many people would survive if we were all simultaneously exposed to an almost universally and instantly fatal biological agent.\n \n \nEither way, you're beat.\n\n \n Not at all, because both 'ways' you describe are completely beside the point. It's not about both colonies surviving or both not, or one surviving and the other not. It's about the difference in variation in survival rates induced by different starting sample sizes and numbers of cell divisions before plating. Large samples from large colony + no cell divisions = low survival variance (similar numbers of survivors in each sample). Tiny samples from same large colony + many cell divisions = same size samples but high variance (radically different numbers of survivors in each sample).",

   "WW, I'm not sure what point you're trying to make here. Yes, evolution is the change in allele frequencies in a population over successive generations. Yes, that could also be described (slightly less precisely, I feel) as the change in 'genetic composition' of a population. You'll note that when I agreed with the latter as a working definition for the purposes of this discussion, I pointed out it was not exactly the biological definition. \n \n The main difference is the part you didn't embolden, which mentions natural selection. That's part of the theory of evolution (along with random mutation and other factors). I accepted the working definition because in this thread we're contrasting Lamarckism with the Darwinian ToE, both of which claim to explain the observed fact of evolution.\n \n You're getting very worked up, using lots of punctuation, seemingly trying to browbeat me (and others) into admitting I accept a definition of evolution that I have already voluntarily and repeatedly vouchsafed. So what's the punchline? What do you think you're achieving by so ingeniously getting me to admit what I've been trying to tell you all along?\n \n Evolution is the change in (allele frequencies)/(genetic composition) in a population over successive generations.\n \n Natural Selection and Random Mutation are mechanisms involved in evolution. They form part of the ToE.\n \n The effect of NS (differential reproductive rates) upon allele frequencies is fairly intuitive - almost tautological, as you've said, though as I've said it's better described as a feedback process. The effect of RM on allele frequencies is, also fairly intuitively, to increase the frequency of an allele from 0 to 1. That '0 to 1' is the origination of a trait. I wonder - is that where you're getting the idea that I'm saying origination is 'the same as' distribution? Simply because they can both be described as a change in allele frequency (though the mechanisms behind that change are radically different)? Personally I think that's a bit of a stretch: a birth and a death also represent a change in allele frequency, but that's not saying they're 'the same thing'. They're just events that both affect a particular numerical measurement we can make.\n \n EDIT: In case you missed it, I corrected a few of your misapprehensions re. the Fluctuation Test in a recent post.

   "The source is Sir Julian Huxley. It may have been in more than one book that he wrote, one of which was \"Evolutionary Humanism\", (1992, p.9)\nStill not a correct cite. It is quite clear that you got that quote from some creationist web site rather than from a reading of the book. Otherwise you would know the \"Evolutionary Humanism\" is not about biological evolution. That should have been clear from the title unless one is a creationist. Perhaps you are unaware that Sir Julian died in 1975 and the 1992 edition is a reprint. \"Evolutionary Humanism\" is a collection of essays about birth control, population control, and overpopulation. \"Evolutionary Humanism\" was published in 1964 as an elaboration of a previous collection of essays, \"Essays of a Humanist\" (1964), which was an elaboration of a previous collection, \"The Humanist Frame\" (1962). Huxley became interested in social issues when he was director of UNESCO in the 40s. Nevertheless, I wouldn't hang too much importance on anything that Huxley said when it is taken out of context as creationists so commonly do. For one thing, many advances have come about since Huxley did his work. If you wish to quote Huxley, you should find more modern support. For another, Huxley was a proponent of eugenics, which became unpopular among biologists many years ago. Of course, some christian nations, like Nazi Germany favored such ideas.\n \nNow if you say that the definition of evolution should STOP after this phrase; \"Change in the genetic composition of a population during successive generations\" and Huxley says \"He rendered evolution inescapable as a fact, comprehensible as a process, all-embracing as a concept\" do you believe Huxley STOPPED after that statement by calling evolution \"all embracing as a concept?\nWhat is it about creationism that so restricts the cognitive abilities of creationists? Huxley isn't defining evolution. He is talking about evolutionary concepts based on the definition. I'll repeat it again for you. The definition should stop where I indicated because the rest of the quote specifies that natural selection is required for evolution to take place, as well as the development of new species. Natural selection is one of several mechanisms of evolution that cause changes in allele frequencies. Other mechanisms can cause changes in allele frequencies and therefore evolution. Thus it is incorrect to define evolution in terms of natural selection. The same is true of speciation. New species are not required for evolution to have taken place. However, new species are certainly examples of evolution.\n \n Think about it. There is a difference between the definitions of words and the concepts based on those definitions.\n \nBeck's book \"Bioscience\" (1982, p738) How do we STOP at \"change in genetic composition\" and then allow it to alter our thinking, methods, and interpretations?\nYou haven't read anything by Dr Beck either, have you. Can you even tell us what his specialization was without looking it up? How about Huxley? Any idea?\n \nThere seems to be a difference in what evolution is defined as, and what evolution is.\nSo you are saying that it depends on what the meaning of \"is\" is? Yes there is a difference between the events and phenomena that meet the definition of evolution and the definition. The concept isn't all that difficult but it seems to by a bit beyond you.\n \nA few bascis of evolution can pass 'rigorous testing', (rigorous testing is demanded of ALL aspects of ID) then when evolution becomes \"all embracing as a concept\" it can't pass rigorous tests. When called on it, evolutionists quickly retreat behind narrow \"definitions\".\nActually, ID has never been tested in any way. You would have to have some empirical evidence for that to happen.\n \nDoes \"change in genetic compositions\" - \"change in allele frequencies\" all by themselves, disprove creation?\nI never thought about it since it has nothing to do with science or evolutionary biology. Creationism is a religious idea that everything was magically created by some magic being a short time ago. Recourse to magic and magical beings aren't required in science.\n \nI didn't use the word \"biologist\". I used the word \"evolutionist\". There is a difference, but neither are experts on how words are used in a society.\nI used the word biologist because some evolutionists who are not biologists misuse the word. And biologists are experts on how that word is used in the context of biological science. It is irrelevant how it is used in society. You can misuse it anyway you want but you should at least be honest enough to admit that when you use the word incorrectly you are not arguing against evolutionary biology but a straw man. But that seems to be the sum total of arguments by creationism and ID.\n \nI'm not talking about biologists. I'm talking about posters on 4forums.\nIrrelevant and dishonest. See above.\n \nMaybe all those new species aren't evolution because;\nAlready explained. New species are evolution because they are caused by events that fit the definition. Really. Try to think more logically.\n \nBut if it's \"all embracing as a concept\" those new species are evolution aren't they?\nWhy not? Your thinking is limited again.\n \nBut are they required to \"disprove creation\"?\nWho cares? You can believe in magic if you want but there isn't any evidence for it.\n \nSo it is explained by evolution, but is not part of the definition of evolution?\nCorrect.\n \nDo evolutionists have any methods for drawing the line concerning 'rigorous testing' when evolution (that all embracing concept) strays away from it's definitions and begins explaining things?\nIt doesn't stray away from anything. It explains how the mechanisms cause changes that fit the definition.\n \nAre you surprised that no one here seems to want to debate the \"evolution is atheistic\" resolution I made in the debate challanges forum? Maybe because they're afraid I can show the difference between \"definitions\" and \"explanations\"? If you don't think I can, why don't you accept the challange?\nWho gives a rat's tootie. Magic isn't required for science. Evolution is atheistic in the same way that plumbing is atheistic.",

   "Still not a correct cite. It is quite clear that you got that quote from some creationist web site rather than from a reading of the book. Otherwise you would know the \"Evolutionary Humanism\" is not about biological evolution. That should have been clear from the title unless one is a creationist. \n\n \n What's clear from the title is that biological evolution so easily can become a vehicle for evolutionary humanism. (atheism)\n \n \nPerhaps you are unaware that Sir Julian died in 1975 and the 1992 edition is a reprint. \"Evolutionary Humanism\" is a collection of essays about birth control, population control, and overpopulation. \"Evolutionary Humanism\" was published in 1964 as an elaboration of a previous collection of essays, \"Essays of a Humanist\" (1964), which was an elaboration of a previous collection, \"The Humanist Frame\" (1962). Huxley became interested in social issues when he was director of UNESCO in the 40s. Nevertheless, I wouldn't hang too much importance on anything that Huxley said when it is taken out of context as creationists so commonly do. \n\n \n The quote has 67 words in it - it represents a complete thought process. Same with Beck's 20 words. Have a look at Talkorigins \"index to creationist claims\", and you'll find 6, 8, 10 word phrases (by creationists) with many 3, and 4 word phrases, most of them taken out of context. Evolutionary double standards have no bounds. \n \n \nFor one thing, many advances have come about since Huxley did his work. \n\n \n Advances in liberalism / atheism, yes. \n \n \nIf you wish to quote Huxley, you should find more modern support. \n\n \n I don't know why - Huxley based his atheism on 'Origin of Species', and \"more modern support\" of Huxley and atheim, is based on 'Origin of Species'. From Herbert Spencer to today's college professors, there's little difference in 'Origin of Species' thumpers. \n \n \n \nFor another, Huxley was a proponent of eugenics, which became unpopular among biologists many years ago. Of course, some christian nations, like Nazi Germany favored such ideas. \n\n \n It became unpopular among biologists, but it was started by science, not religion. It was driven by 'progressive' politics. Are you going to tell me that eugenics is favored by Christianity in the U.S. today?\n \n \n \nWhat is it about creationism that so restricts the cognitive abilities of creationists? Huxley isn't defining evolution. He is talking about evolutionary concepts based on the definition. \n\n \n I agree - he's using evolutionary concepts to promote and establish atheism.\n \n \nI'll repeat it again for you. The definition should stop where I indicated because the rest of the quote specifies that natural selection is required for evolution to take place, as well as the development of new species. Natural selection is one of several mechanisms of evolution that cause changes in allele frequencies. Other mechanisms can cause changes in allele frequencies and therefore evolution. Thus it is incorrect to define evolution in terms of natural selection. The same is true of speciation. New species are not required for evolution to have taken place. However, new species are certainly examples of evolution.\n \n Think about it. There is a difference between the definitions of words and the concepts based on those definitions. \n\n \n Exactly - the discussion between WW and all his opponents here about concepts based on those definitions, and all his opponents constant references to definitions are merely subject changes and insults, to mask said opponents inability to rufute his points. \n \n \n \nYou haven't read anything by Dr Beck either, have you. Can you even tell us what his specialization was without looking it up? How about Huxley? Any idea? \n\n \n Well without any attempt to look it up, how about this shot in the dark; their specializations are using evolution to indoctrinate future generations into atheism, and influence the liberal politics of the current generation. Close? If you say no, maybe I'll research it a little and get back to you. \n \n \n \nSo you are saying that it depends on what the meaning of \"is\" is? Yes there is a difference between the events and phenomena that meet the definition of evolution and the definition. The concept isn't all that difficult but it seems to by a bit beyond you. \n\n \n Beyond me? It is WW's opponents who seem to be constantly trying to pin him down on definitions, on defining the meaning of the word \"is\", while he's trying to talk about events and phenomena!\n \n \n \nActually, ID has never been tested in any way. You would have to have some empirical evidence for that to happen. \n\n \n Yes that's the evolutionist claim, but then evolutionists aren't interested in the details of I.D. When evolutionists have sufficient financial backing, neither are the courts. \n \n \n \nI never thought about it since it has nothing to do with science or evolutionary biology. \n\n \n The phrase \"Evolution disproves creation\" is found at plenty of websites that deal with evolutionary biology, and if I remember right you and several of your friends have said it yourselves at these forums before. Yet you've never thought about it? \n \n \nCreationism is a religious idea that everything was magically created by some magic being a short time ago. Recourse to magic and magical beings aren't required in science. \n\n \n It is required, and it is there. Godless, naturalist magic. Big bangs, abiogenesis, etc. \n \n \n \nI used the word biologist because some evolutionists who are not biologists misuse the word. And biologists are experts on how that word is used in the context of biological science. It is irrelevant how it is used in society. \n\n \n It really is relevent if some evolutionists misuse the word in society, in courts. \n \n \nYou can misuse it anyway you want but you should at least be honest enough to admit that when you use the word incorrectly you are not arguing against evolutionary biology but a straw man. But that seems to be the sum total of arguments by creationism and ID. \n\n \n A straw man? Or events and phenomena? \n \n \nAlready explained. New species are evolution because they are caused by events that fit the definition. Really. Try to think more logically.\n Why not? Your thinking is limited again. \n\n \n Sometimes new species are evolution, and sometimes they are not, it depends on the evolutionists mood at the time. \n \n \nWhy not? Your thinking is limited again. \n\n \n Why NOT??? I made a positive statement! \n \n \nWho cares? You can believe in magic if you want but there isn't any evidence for it. \n\n \n Evolutionists care! They believe in Godless magic, big bangs, selection without a selector, and see a threat in God!\n \n \nSo it is explained by evolution, but is not part of the definition of evolution? \n\n \n \nCorrect. \n\n \n Then why, starting with post 158, continued in other posts with insults like post 177, piled on by you in post 208, are definitions such a big deal?\n \n \n \nIt doesn't stray away from anything. It explains how the mechanisms cause changes that fit the definition. \n\n \n It strays away from it in evolutionary humanism, in eugenics, in social sciences, in politics, in history, on and on. \n \n \n \nWho gives a rat's tootie. Magic isn't required for science. Evolution is atheistic in the same way that plumbing is atheistic.\n\n \n Ah yes, plumbing. Talkorigins says the same thing - what a coincidence. I think it deserves a deeper look. I'd like to explore how events and phenomena that arise due to plumbing are comparable to how they arise in evolution, if court cases concerning plumbing are comparable to court cases concerning evoulution, if plumbers write books on eugenics, if plumbers look into pipes and determine that the book of Genesis is wrong. \n \n I'll keep waiting.",

Have you been inhaling sewer gas again?\n \nIt became unpopular among biologists, but it was started by science, not religion.\nAnd it was also debunked by science, not religion.

What do you think?\n \nI agree - he's using evolutionary concepts to promote and establish atheism.\nYou're a dishonest sort, aren't you. Atheism wasn't mentioned. Honest. Evolutionary biology has zero to do with your petty little god.\n \nExactly - the discussion between WW and all his opponents here about concepts based on those definitions, and all his opponents constant references to definitions are merely subject changes and insults, to mask said opponents inability to rufute his points.\nIf you don't understand it, then how do you know that you oppose it. Your remarks only reveal your dismal ignorance of the subject. The point is the if you wish to misdefine scientific concepts then your objections are garbage. What does it meant to \"rufute\" his points and why would we want to do that?\n \nWell without any attempt to look it up, how about this shot in the dark; their specializations are using evolution to indoctrinate future generations into atheism, and influence the liberal politics of the current generation. Close? If you say no, maybe I'll research it a little and get back to you.\nThanks for making my point. You don't know what you are talking about and you have never read anything by either Sir Julian or Beck. In other words, your quotes were taken out of context. You are a dupe and are merely parroting some creationist web site.\n \n Wouldn't it be better to do the research before you speak? You make yourself look like a fool when you post without knowledge.\n \nBeyond me? It is WW's opponents who seem to be constantly trying to pin him down on definitions, on defining the meaning of the word \"is\", while he's trying to talk about events and phenomena!\nThen you actually don't have any idea of what we are talking about. How can you talk about events and phenomena without defining the meaning of the words that you use to describe them? Obviously, the concepts are beyond you. Here. Let me give you an example. Jesus was a homo.\n \nYes that's the evolutionist claim, but then evolutionists aren't interested in the details of I.D. When evolutionists have sufficient financial backing, neither are the courts.\nOoooooh! You poor persecuted christians. You can't offer any evidence for you claims and the reason must be that those evil evolooootionists aren't interested. Yo! Kiddo! Just take a look at our President, the make up of Congress and the Supreme Court, and every legislative body in every state and tell me that you poor christians are a persecuted minority. Thankfully, there are Christians in authority who have more integrity than you, and act according to our Constitution.\n \nThe phrase \"Evolution disproves creation\" is found at plenty of websites that deal with evolutionary biology, and if I remember right you and several of your friends have said it yourselves at these forums before. Yet you've never thought about it?\nWho gives a rat's tootie about web sites? We are talking about science. Please cite peer reviewed literature where such a claim is made. Do you have even the slightest idea of what you are talking about?\n \n Moreover, you are a liar. I have never made any such claim. Your lack of integrity is beyond belief! Oh! Wait! You are a christian. Never mind. It's not beyond belief. Lying for Jesus is acceptable.\n \nIt is required, and it is there. Godless, naturalist magic. Big bangs, abiogenesis, etc.\nBWAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Better that we should just explain everything that we don't understand by magic. GODDIDIT!\n \nIt really is relevent if some evolutionists misuse the word in society, in courts.\nBut they didn't. Have you actually read the Dover transcriptions? I doubt it. You get you information from 20 word quotes. Cite specific examples or be revealed for a fool and a liar. Exactly what kind of vent is a \"relevent\"?\n \nA straw man? Or events and phenomena?\nA straw man. Neither creationism or ID has ever presented evidence in favor of the hypothesis. Mostly both hypotheses offer straw man arguments against science.\n \nSometimes new species are evolution, and sometimes they are not, it depends on the evolutionists mood at the time.\nAny specific references to back up that completely ignorant statement? Speciation is always evolution. It would be stupid to claim otherwise.[/quote]\n \nWhy NOT??? I made a positive statement!\nBut your positive statement was based on assumed conclusions. It is worthless.\n \nEvolutionists care! They believe in Godless magic, big bangs, selection without a selector, and see a threat in God!\nActually, all of that is pure idiocy. Why are you so excited. Calm down and try to think rationally. There is no magic, only something that you disagree with. There is a selector. Your petty god isn't a threat to evolutionary theory. Reality is what it is. Your god is a threat when you can declare that the earth is the center of the universe and that it is unmoving. Your god is a threat when people can be burned at the stake for disagreeing.\n \nThen why, starting with post 158, continued in other posts with insults like post 177, piled on by you in post 208, are definitions such a big deal?\nAre you daft? What insults? Pointing out misunderstanding of definitions is not an insult. Definitions are a big deal because if you don't understand the definitions, then you don't understand the discussion. Let me illustrate once more. Jesus was a homo.\n \nIt strays away from it in evolutionary humanism, in eugenics, in social sciences, in politics, in history, on and on.\nBut humanism, eugenics, social sciences, politics, and history have nothing to do with evolutionary biology. Those ideas only get in the way. Please! At least have the integrity to learn what you are talking about.\n \nAh yes, plumbing. Talkorigins says the same thing - what a coincidence.\nActually, talkorigins doesn't. There are 5 mentions of plumbing at TO and none of them are meaningful to what I said. Why do you find it necessary to lie?\n \nI think it deserves a deeper look. I'd like to explore how events and phenomena that arise due to plumbing are comparable to how they arise in evolution, if court cases concerning plumbing are comparable to court cases concerning evoulution, if plumbers write books on eugenics, if plumbers look into pipes and determine that the book of Genesis is wrong.\nWhat a good idea. Everyone knows that plumbing is an atheistic endeavor. Some god must be involved in the clearing of clogged sewer pipes, since god caused those pipes to be clogged in the first place. Praying should be enough to solve the problem. I'm glad that you actually recognize where you god belongs.\n \nI'll keep waiting.\nFor what? An answer from your god?

Very good - now let's look at yours;\n \n *I don't understand you objection. \n *wipe the drool of of your chin. \n *What does it meant to\n *The point is the if you wish to \n *You can't offer any evidence for you claims \n *You get you information from \n *you actually recognize where you god belongs.\n \n A seven to three ratio - you haven't improved since our earlier discussions. Have you ever considered knocking off with the typo insults?\n \n \n \nWhat unmitigated bilge. Have you been inhaling sewer gas again? \n *I don't know what that means.\n *Jesus was a homo.\n *Ooooooh!\n *BWAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.\n *Are you daft?\n *You make yourself look like a fool when you post without knowledge. \n\n \n You sputter with rage better than electrolyte. :) \n \n \n \n \nAnd it was also debunked by science, not religion. Religion doesn't contribute in any way to science. \n\n \n Religious morality could have politically influenced them to debunk it. \n \n \n \nI have heard such ideas from christians, especially in reference to poor blacks who advocate sterilization as a condition for welfare. What do you think? \n\n \n Since eugenics originated from Galton/Darwin/evolution, I think those Christians you heard may have been playing identity games. Here, read something about Darwin's cousin, Dalton, the founder of eugenics, and how it made it to Nazi Germany;\n \n http://www.thedarwinpapers.com/oldsite/number13/number13.html\n \n \nAs we have seen, Francis Galton's theory, based on Charles Darwin's ideas, was largely responsible for many of the brutal pseudo-scientific experiments conducted by Germany during the period of Nazi domination.\n\n \n \n \nYou're a dishonest sort, aren't you. Atheism wasn't mentioned. Honest. Evolutionary biology has zero to do with your petty little god. \n\n \n The word that designates a worldview does not have to be mentioned to be implied. You attack my religion all the time, though I seldom actually mention it. \n \n \nIf you don't understand it, then how do you know that you oppose it. Your remarks only reveal your dismal ignorance of the subject. The point is the if you wish to misdefine scientific concepts then your objections are garbage. \n\n \n I didn't see him misdefining them. He was discussing them, and definitions were brought up to stop the discussion, and send it on another path. I see complex discussions happen all the time without constant stops to discuss definitions of very general words that are generally understood. In the economics forum for example, do you see constant interruptions of thought happen as the word \"economics\" is defined and re-defined and squabbled over? \n \n \n \nThanks for making my point. You don't know what you are talking about and you have never read anything by either Sir Julian or Beck. In other words, your quotes were taken out of context. You are a dupe and are merely parroting some creationist web site. \n\n \n You never parrot evolutionist/atheist websites?\n \n \nThen you actually don't have any idea of what we are talking about. How can you talk about events and phenomena without defining the meaning of the words that you use to describe them? \n\n \n If you're talking about honest people using general, broad words like evolution or economics, it's not difficult. \n \n \n \nOoooooh! You poor persecuted christians. You can't offer any evidence for you claims and the reason must be that those evil evolooootionists aren't interested. Yo! Kiddo! Just take a look at our President, the make up of Congress and the Supreme Court, and every legislative body in every state and tell me that you poor christians are a persecuted minority. Thankfully, there are Christians in authority who have more integrity than you, and act according to our Constitution. \n\n \n The Constitution shouldn't \"change over time\". But as we have seen, some interpretations of it have. That's another political problem with evolutionists, they really like everything possible to change over time. \n \n \n \nWho gives a rat's tootie about web sites? We are talking about science. Please cite peer reviewed literature where such a claim is made. Do you have even the slightest idea of what you are talking about? \n\n \n What goes on in a society is not dictated only by \"peer reviewed literature\". It's formed by an overall opinion of people, leaders and non leaders alike. Information can come from anywhere. More impressionable people may read websites, or watch opinionated news reports, than read peer reviewed literature.\n \n \nMoreover, you are a liar. I have never made any such claim. Your lack of integrity is beyond belief! Oh! Wait! You are a christian. Never mind. It's not beyond belief. Lying for Jesus is acceptable. \n\n \n Let's have a look at exactly what I said;\n \n \nOriginally Posted by marc9000 \n The phrase \"Evolution disproves creation\" is found at plenty of websites that deal with evolutionary biology, and if I remember right you and several of your friends have said it yourselves at these forums before. Yet you've never thought about it? \n\n \n \"You and several of your friends\" was my statement. A quick look at the thread \"questions for both sides\", in this forum, shows us this in post's #20, and #21;\n \n 20\nNot historical documents but mythology. Genesis isn't historical. To believe that it is takes a certain intentional ignorance of the universe. \n\n \n 21\nIt [evolution]can and already has proved a literal interpretation of Genesis false.\n\n \n Are you going to apologize for calling me a liar?\n \n \n \nBWAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Better that we should just explain everything that we don't understand by magic. GODDIDIT! \n\n \n Or the magic of the big bang? The \"rigorously testable\" big bang?\n \n \n \nBut they didn't. Have you actually read the Dover transcriptions? I doubt it. \n\n \n I remember reading a page of Jones comments about it, don't remember where. He seemed to be quite enthralled with all the media attention and pretty camaras, he never expected it, and had never seen anything like it before. It led me to believe that as a human he may not be perfect. \n \n \n \nA straw man. Neither creationism or ID has ever presented evidence in favor of the hypothesis. Mostly both hypotheses offer straw man arguments against science.\n\n \n Or actual scientific arguments against evolution. Falsification is part of science. Have you ever heard of universal probablility bound? There are mathematical ways to determine if an event can be attributed to pure chance, when considering scientific knowledge of the limited number of elementary particles, and time required for transitions, even when considering a universe that's billions of years old. A point can be determined when a specified event cannot be attributed to chance. Is it any wonder that commited evolutionists and atheists need to keep ID out of schools?\n \n \nAny specific references to back up that completely ignorant statement? Speciation is always evolution. It would be stupid to claim otherwise.\n\n \n \nEvolution is not required by definition to produce new species.\n\n \n Evolution is not required to produce new species, but it does, and speciation is always evoluton. I'm glad economics isn't this complicated. \n \n \n \nActually, all of that is pure idiocy. Why are you so excited. Calm down and try to think rationally. \n\n \n It was only three exclamation points - trying to get your attention. Not comparable to;\n \n \nJesus was a homo.\n *Ooooooh!\n *BWAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.\n *Are you daft? \n\n \n Shall I define the word \"excited\" for you?\n \n \n \nAre you daft? What insults? Pointing out misunderstanding of definitions is not an insult. \n\n \n Wording them in this way is. Post #177 (one of the posts that I pointed out to you);\n \n \nAgain, using the wrong definition does not make you correct and them wrong. It makes you appear ignorant and your argument vacuous. If you won't even trouble yourself to learn the proper terms used in a field which you are arguing against, how is anyone supposed to take you seriously?\n\n \n \nDefinitions are a big deal because if you don't understand the definitions, then you don't understand the discussion. Let me illustrate once more. Jesus was a homo. \n\n \n What insults, you ask? Shall I define the word \"insult\" for you?\n \n \n \nBut humanism, eugenics, social sciences, politics, and history have nothing to do with evolutionary biology. Those ideas only get in the way. Please! At least have the integrity to learn what you are talking about. \n\n \n Did you learn anything above about eugenics and Galton's beliefs in Darwin's ideas? An imperfect human's ideas of evolutionary biology didn't \"get in the way\" of eugenics, they invented it! \n \n \n \nActually, talkorigins doesn't. There are 5 mentions of plumbing at TO and none of them are meaningful to what I said. Why do you find it necessary to lie? \n\n \n Let's look - here's what you said, as you were declining my request for a formal debate about evolution being atheistic;\n \n \nEvolution is atheistic in the same way that plumbing is atheistic. \n\n \n Now lets look at the talkorigins \"rebuttal\" of the creationist claim \"evolution is atheistic;\n \n \nEvolution is no more atheistic than biochemistry, farming, engineering, plumbing, art, law, and so forth. \n\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA602.html\n \n Are you going to apologize for calling me a liar? emoticon_xangel Really, you'd do better if you weren't sputtering with rage. \n \n \n \nWhat a good idea. Everyone knows that plumbing is an atheistic endeavor. Some god must be involved in the clearing of clogged sewer pipes, since god caused those pipes to be clogged in the first place. Praying should be enough to solve the problem. I'm glad that you actually recognize where you god belongs. \n\n \n No, everybody knows that plumbing is NOT an atheist endeavor, and how clearly stupid it is for talkorigins to compare the two, and you for parroting them.\n \n \n \nFor what? An answer from your god? \n\n \n No, for someone to accept my formal debate challange. Sputtering with rage is affecting your reading comprehension.",
