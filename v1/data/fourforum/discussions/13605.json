   "Uninsured patients with traumatic injuries, such as car crashes, falls and gunshot wounds, were almost twice as likely to die in the hospital as similarly injured patients with health insurance, according to a troubling new study.\n \n The findings by Harvard University researchers surprised doctors and health experts who have believed emergency room care was equitable.\n \n \"This is another drop in a sea of evidence that the uninsured fare much worse in their health in the United States,\" said senior author Dr. Atul Gawande, a Harvard surgeon and medical journalist.\n \n The study, appearing in the November issue of Archives of Surgery, comes as Congress is debating the expansion of health insurance coverage to millions more Americans. It could add fodder to that debate.\n \n The researchers couldn't pin down the reasons behind the differences they found. The uninsured might experience more delays being transferred from hospital to hospital. Or they might get different care. Or they could have more trouble communicating with doctors.\n \n The hospitals that treat them also could have fewer resources.\n \n \"Those hospitals tend to be financially strapped, not have the same level of staffing, not have the same level of surgeons and testing and equipment,\" Gawande said. \"That also is likely a major contributor.\"\n \n Gawande favors health care reform and has frequently written about the inequities of the current system.\n \n The researchers took into account the severity of the injuries and the patients' race, gender and age. After those adjustments, they still found the uninsured were 80 percent more likely to die than those with insurance - even low-income patients insured by the government's Medicaid program.\n \n \"I'm really surprised,\" said Dr. Eric Lavonas of the American College of Emergency Physicians and a doctor at Denver Health Medical Center. \"It's well known that people without health insurance don't get the same quality of health care in this country, but I would have thought that this group of patients would be the least vulnerable.\"\n\n Uninsured ER patients twice as likely to die - Health care- msnbc.com\n \n I don't know why we have to keep proving there is a health care problem in this nation...\n It's obvious to anybody who recognizes the truth.",

   "According to a recent Commonwealth Fund Commission report, U.S. health care is the most expensive in the world, but does not meet critical benchmarks for quality, access, and other major performance measures. While America spends twice as much per capita on health care, it ranks lower than most other industrialized nations on numerous indicators of overall care; the U.S. score averaged 65 out of 100 over 37 categories, and fell to last for \"preventing deaths through use of timely and effective medical care.\"\n \n Can we afford covering the 47 million uninsured and the 50 million underinsured nationwide? Yes, we can. Currently, insurance companies have an overhead of approximately 30 percent, which is spent on marketing, administration, shareholders dividends and exorbitant CEO salaries. Medicare's overhead is approximately 3 percent. We could save about $350 billion annually, enough to cover the 47 million uninsured and the 50 million underinsured.

It very clearly states that they believe there is a problem with the method therefore a difference is not known. \n \n \nIf you are not sure why don't you support the public option? Let the public sector compete with the public sector and we will find out who does better.\nBecause the answer is obvious and has played out the same way for centuries. The public option would be cheaper at first because there is no way to measure efficiency in the government. In the private world you have profits and real money which solve this problem very easily. So with a public option you are competing with someone who has unlimited resources and no need for a profit. In other words no one could compete. Everyone knows this which is why they like the public option...it is basically pre-universal healthcare. After you remove the insurance companies and the federal government realizes it can't run a deficit for forever you get either higher costs or reduced care. \n \n But for the sake of argument lets assume this wouldn't happen. Why on earth would you get the federal government in the health care industry? If they could do it better why couldn't they do everything better? I just don't see a rational argument for it.\n \n \n \nWe do not need to go into the accounting technicalities and decide here and now where the costs wil be cut.

I looked at those 10 and they are fine but have nothing to do with the government other than the fraud thing since Medicare doesn't seem to think it is important. In fact most of those highlight the reform Symbiote keeps posting.\n \n \nWhat we are trying to establish is that the cost IS higher than in other countries and the outcomes in the U.S. are not better. You can dispute how they rank countries and how to measure the wait times but you cannot dispute that our cost is 50% higher than in Germany. The waste has to be eliminated.\nWell a few points with this. First off, as we say with administrative expenses, it depends on what you count. I think this is extremely important when developing a plan to change an entire sector of our economy. All too often I hear \"US is private and expensive, Europe is universal and cheap; therefore, if the US goes universal the US will be cheap\". It's a fallacy and a dangerous way to look at things. The costs have to be reduced somewhere. Are you going to cut doctors pay? Are you going to do less tests? Are you going to make patients wait longer? Are you going to cut the number of MRI machines purchased in a year? Are you going to stop research? The difference between the US and Germany is not the big evil insurance companies...in fact, it's not even a big portion of it. So if this is all true than how will costs be lowered in the US by a universal system?

   "\n But for the sake of argument lets assume this wouldn't happen. Why on earth would you get the federal government in the health care industry? If they could do it better why couldn't they do everything better? I just don't see a rational argument for it.\n \n\n Medicare and single payer system have lower administrative costs. This is well established. But again, why don't we give the government a chance and see who does better?\n \n \n\n I looked at those 10 and they are fine but have nothing to do with the government other than the fraud thing since Medicare doesn't seem to think it is important. \n \n\n \n Nobody said anything about the government. I said these were ways to cut cost.\n \n \n\n Well a few points with this. First off, as we say with administrative expenses, it depends on what you count. I think this is extremely important when developing a plan to change an entire sector of our economy. All too often I hear \"US is private and expensive, Europe is universal and cheap; therefore, if the US goes universal the US will be cheap\". It's a fallacy and a dangerous way to look at things. The costs have to be reduced somewhere. Are you going to cut doctors pay? Are you going to do less tests? Are you going to make patients wait longer? Are you going to cut the number of MRI machines purchased in a year? Are you going to stop research? \n \n\n Maybe, yes, no, yes, no\n \n \n\n So if this is all true than how will costs be lowered in the US by a universal system? Where will the cuts be?\n \n\n I said that both goals i.e. cutting cost and universal healthcare were desirable even if there was no causal relationship between them. There probably is, but even if here is not we still need to achieve both goals.\n \n One thing is clear. The private insurance companies are not able to control cost. As the article I quoted states the problem is the fee for service system. The more services the doctor performs (usually tests performed by nurses and technicians) the more he hets paid. He has incentive to do these things and they are not necessarily the shortest path to a cure. The insurance companes have not figured this out. And the administrative costs are still a factor your denial nothwithstanding.\n \n \n \n You do if your goal is to lower costs or your argument is that US costs are too high.\n \n\n Not following your logic.",

   "Medicare and single payer system have lower administrative costs. This is well established. But again, why don't we give the government a chance and see who does better?\nIt isn't well established. I point this out with those two articles which make very important points on the matter. In fact, they go further and make a better point and state that even if it turns out they are more expensive it might not mean you aren't getting anything for the extra dollar. But even if true, why is this a good reason to use the government? \n \n \nNobody said anything about the government. I said these were ways to cut cost.\nI did. I said this \"Maybe the US does waste here. But the obvious question is what do you cut and how much does that save when using a universal system.\" Which you responded with that link. Perhaps I wasn't clear but I am saying how would single-payer or universal healthcare cause a drop in overall healthcare costs on par with other countries? Not what the system could do in the future because any system could do those.\n \n \n \nMaybe, yes, no, yes, no\nVery well. That is a maybe doctors pay (which is apparently on-par with England..not for specialists) and yes to cutting tests and I assume equipment purchases. With equipment purchases you basically concede the wait time point. I don't see why single-payer folks just don't admit this. I'd respect the point that lower costs are better than having every hospital with 2 MRI machines with the cost of higher wait times even when I disagree with it. I could make an economical point about MRI machines but maybe this isn't the time. You also say cutting tests which is only done a few ways. Either you remove any penalty for not doing enough tests or you dictate what tests can be done for certain conditions. The later is scary to many Americans who don't want to be told by the government what tests they need (a common pro-choice argument haha). \n \n I think the larger point here is that these two things are a result of government intrusion in the first place and can be solved without a single-payer system for much less. So again, how is universal healthcare going to benefit in a way that private can't? \n \n \nI said that both goals i.e. cutting cost and universal healthcare were desirable even if there was no causal relationship between them. There probably is, but even if here is not we still need to achieve both goals.\nI mean I somewhat agree with this.\n \n \nOne thing is clear. The private insurance companies are not able to control cost.\nOf course not just like your car insurance company can't control the cost of cars or its maintenance. \n \n \nAs the article I quoted states the problem is the fee for service system. The more services the doctor performs (usually tests performed by nurses and technicians) the more he hets paid. He has incentive to do these things and they are not necessarily the shortest path to a cure. The insurance companes have not figured this out. \nAnd why isn't this the same with an auto-mechanic...although sometimes it is...or at the veterinary hosptial? The answer is you won't pay your bill and you will never shop there again. Even more so now with better communication on what places overcharge. If people paid directly wouldn't this solve the problem? Hell, I'd even be up for a federal funded website listing the cost of every procedure and what is \"normal\" for a procedure that way you could look it up and refuse to pay the doctor if they screw you over. \n \n \nAnd the administrative costs are still a factor your denial nothwithstanding.\nWell until you prove those articles I showed wrong I will deny it.

Smith \n 03/27/2006 12:00:00 AM \n \n AT LAST A HIGH GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL in Europe got up the nerve to chastise the Dutch government for preparing to legalize infant euthanasia. Italy's Parliamentary Affairs minister, Carlo Giovanardi, said during a radio debate: \"Nazi legislation and Hitler's ideas are reemerging in Europe via Dutch euthanasia laws and the debate on how to kill ill children.\" \n \n Unsurprisingly, the Dutch, ever prickly about international criticism of their peculiar institution, were outraged. Giovanardi's critique cut so deeply that even Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende felt the need to respond, sniffing, \"This [Giovanardi's assertion] is scandalous and unacceptable. This is not the way to get along in Europe.\"\n \n As is often the case in the New Europe, what is said matters more than what is done. Thus, the prime minister of the Netherlands thinks that killing babies because they are born with terminal or seriously disabling conditions is not a scandal, but daring to point out accurately that German doctors did the same during World War II, is. \n Killing Babies, Compassionately",

Insurance companies aren't getting rich killing off the poor little consumers. Now, if you want to know who is, look at the bankers. You put your money into a bank and get a few % interest.

They have the lowest profit margins of almost all insurance types. Health insurance profits and direct costs don't even account for much of the health care dollar..something like 6 or 7%...while hospitals are well over 30% if I recall correctly.

You seem to think the government can provide competition to something in order to lower prices. This has never happened before and considering there already is a large number of companies purposes the high costs are not related to health insurances companies directly. Like I said earlier, they go with the hand they are dealt. If you have rules restricting insurance over state lines and an indirect way of paying by the customer (employer pays it) than you get what you have now. A lot of this is the fault of the federal government. So why would anyone want them to provide a solution other than to reverse their failures.",

I don't necessarily hold to the ultra conservative postition of 'keep-the-government-out-no-matter-what' like I do on many other issues, :p but I don't know that I'd use the word \"crumbling\" to describe health care in the U.S. today, but there are problems that need to be addressed. \n \n Something that I never see addressed that I'd like to see here, is ~how did it get this way? I've heard it said that it didn't happen overnight, that health care in the U.S. has been a problem for....40 years! The U.S. is over 200 years old, does that mean that its healthcare was fine - no problems at all - for over 160 years? What changed? Were there no problems in 1910 for example, or 1950? Were 44,000 Americans dying every year back then? Probably not, simply because of population increases. But do those types of percentage increases automatically ignite a crisis? \n \n I think the biggest change has been increases in medical technology that our society can't afford. Free market systems don't work well when there is a third party payor, it's just that simple. And of course there are other things that have changed, like our litigious legal system. \n \n What I find myself wondering is what percentage of people who favor government health care see it as a solution to a ONCE GOOD system, vs those who simply never have believed in liberty and limited government.",

   "While you come to the right conclusion, you are still operating under misconceptions put forth by the liberal establishment. Healthcare insurance companies have one of the smallest profit margins of any industry sector. It has an ROI of 2.2%. As I'ver stated earlier, they could sell all of their assets and put the money into the bank and get a higher return than that. So don't buy the liberal hype. Insurance companies aren't getting rich killing off the poor little consumers. Now, if you want to know who is, look at the bankers. You put your money into a bank and get a few % interest. Now go and borrow money from them and you pay up to 30% in interest. Where's the magic wand that made your money worth orders of magnitude LESS than the bank's money? \n Think about that..........and remember, POVERTY KILLS.\n\n \n Makes me trust Wall St. less and less... Still seeing and hearing of peoples insurance premiums and the restrictions of a flawed system shows something has to be done...\n \n I hate to be so cynical as to ask can anyone put the price on a human life?",

   "Not just this but you have to look at what they are not including in this bill but in other bills as part of the cost. Plus the indirect costs of this such as those costs to people who will have medicare advantage cut\n\n \n Yeah the cut in Medicare doesn't sit well with me at all... \n \n \n \nWhile I don't really like the way they are run they run logically based upon the conditions they are given so that they are successful. This is no fault of theirs. Your reasons below are flawed and I'll tell you why.\n The rising costs aren't going to health insurance companies. They have the lowest profit margins of almost all insurance types. Health insurance profits and direct costs don't even account for much of the health care dollar..something like 6 or 7%...while hospitals are well over 30% if I recall correctly. So doubling premiums are no fault of the health insurance industry. 44k Americans dieing because of lack of health coverage is, at best, a misleading number but even if true is unrelated to health insurance companies. \n\n \n Still it is a disturbing number nonetheless. If it is not the insurance companies directly then it is a myriad of factors leading to these poor people not getting adequate care... And something must be done to prevent these things form happening.\n \n \nWhile I agree this doesn't deliver this statement doesn't make much sense to me. You seem to think the government can provide competition to something in order to lower prices. This has never happened before and considering there already is a large number of companies purposes the high costs are not related to health insurances companies directly. Like I said earlier, they go with the hand they are dealt. If you have rules restricting insurance over state lines and an indirect way of paying by the customer (employer pays it) than you get what you have now. A lot of this is the fault of the federal government. So why would anyone want them to provide a solution other than to reverse their failures.\n\n \n I was hoping that giving the insurance companies more competition and having a public option would widen the pool for those who need choice or other options when it comes to insurance. \n \n Regardless we need a solution on all fronts of this issue. If we ignore it it will only get worse for Americans..",

And something must be done to prevent these things form happening.\nIt's probably a little inflated and it is hard to address in the first place. At what point is it the responsibility of the person to go get a check-up for example? \n \n \nI was hoping that giving the insurance companies more competition and having a public option would widen the pool for those who need choice or other options when it comes to insurance. \nWell it doesn't make much sense when you already have a ton of companies. Perhaps congress should understand the other things killing true capitalist forces. \n \n \nRegardless we need a solution on all fronts of this issue. If we ignore it it will only get worse for Americans..\nActually I think the federal government ignoring it is probably the best solution out there. By ignoring I mean repealing some of the restrictive laws they have to protect company profits and what not...they shoulda done the same thing with the economy but we didn't and it hasn't worked out.",
