   "It is just as bad as last year. I do see that interest on debt has worked its way to number four on the expenditure list!! Way to go debt :) Veteran Affairs was sadly bumped to number 5.\n \n I don't see why you say its so bad...I mean just look at this uplifting paragraph:\n \n \nWhile we are unable to express an opinion on the U.S. government's consolidated financial statements, the following key items deserve emphasis in order to put the information contained in the financial statements and the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of the 2006 Financial Report of the United States Government into context. Despite improvement in both the fiscal year 2006 reported net operating cost and the cash-based budget deficit, the U.S. government's total reported liabilities, net social insurance commitments, and other fiscal exposures continue to grow and now total approximately $50 trillion, representing approximately four times the Nation's total output (GDP) in fiscal year 2006, up from about $20 trillion, or two times GDP in fiscal year 2000. As this long-term fiscal imbalance continues to grow, the retirement of the \"baby boom\" generation is closer to becoming a reality with the first wave of boomers eligible for early retirement under Social Security in 2008. Given these and other factors, it seems clear that the nation's current fiscal path is unsustainable and that tough choices by the President and the Congress are necessary in order to address the nation's large and growing long-term fiscal imbalance.\n\n \n I don't see how you could look at that as anything but good news. Why so negative?",

   "By the way, for those that have read the 1-3 articles written about this years financial statements, don't believe everything you read.\n \n Here is one article: http://news.goldseek.com/GoldSeek/1166544060.php\n \n \nIn his accompanying statement to the report, David Walker, Comptroller of the US, warmed up his audience by stating that the GAO had found so many significant material deficiencies in the government's accounting systems that the GAO was \"unable to express an opinion\" on the financial statements. Ha ha! He really knows how to play an audience!\n \n \n \n In accounting parlance, that's the same as telling your spouse \"Our checkbook is such an out of control mess I can't tell if we're broke or rich!\" The next time you have an unexplained rash of checking withdrawals from that fishing trip with your buddies, just tell her that you are \"unable to express an opinion\" and see how that flies. Let us know how it goes!\n\n \n This person is obviously not an accountant as this is a fairly standard audit letter. \"Unable to express an opinion\" is common for companies that stink at keeping records. This wasn't the Comptroller trying to fluff anything. \n \n Other than that stupid comment the article is fairly good.",
