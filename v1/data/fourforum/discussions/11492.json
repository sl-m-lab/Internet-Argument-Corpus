Start coming up with real working solutions that aren't dependent on the magical world of \"If guns didn't exist...\"\n \n Your statement is completely nonsensical, it's along the same lines of saying \"If disease and sickness didn't exist then nobody would die of illness\". It address nothing and does nothing to aid in finding a solution. So let it die, and move onto something else, something more like \"Why do we keep letting known offenders off with a warning so they can reoffend over and over again?\"\n \n \nYou said no correlation. You want no restirctions on the numbers and types of weapons you can buy, but will take no responsibility if any of your fellow gun owners act irresponsibly.\n\n \n If somebody is irresponsible and putting someone else in danger then they should be treated as such and dealt with accordingly.

Being armed is a right I fully intend to enjoy. I'm gonna enjoy it when criminals are out and about and obviously armed, I'm going to enjoy it even if your liberals get smart and start locking up every criminal you can find, and I'm going to enjoy it until the day I die, at which point I'll no longer need my rights.",

I pointed out the strawman you're building on my words, and you're now saying I'm claiming something about gun owners? emoticon_confused\n \n Actually I haven't made my mind up. I'm forwarding the arguments I that I can think of and seeing how they stand up. Mega and I were having an interesting conversation before he seemed to blow up and it all went sour.\n \n I definately don't think in the same way as you do (largely in the fact that I think), so please don't strain yourself trying to guess what I'm thinking. Ask me my position before you attribute it to me. Don't put words in my mouth and then expect me to defend them. I have to say you do that a lot. \n \n I try to argue facts not people. Just because you'd generalize a lot, doesn't mean I would. My American girlfriend owns a gun. I can understand why she would want one, even though it's not something I'm used to.

Nowhere is there a law saying \"If you come under threat start shooting and don't stop for anything\". Letting people be armed isn't encouraging them to unleash deadly force at the drop of the hat, it's ensuring that they don't have to die or be victims, by allowing them more opportunities to choose from.\n \n \nAnd I think there's more options than blasting away or rolling over.\n\n \n There are, but they're extremely limited. If you're unarmed you have the following options: comply and pray for survival and mercy, or try to resist and die.\n \n \nI said that if they think you're armed and everyone else is too, they'll be more likely to shoot first.\n\n \n Really, because I'd like to see some proof of this.
