But once a person is convinced of ID, he must be convinced of a designer, whether or not he cares who or what the designer might be.\n It is also interesting to note that to design nature, one must be supernatural.\n\n \n \n Intelligent design was developed by a group of American creationists who revised their argument in the creation-evolution controversy to circumvent court rulings such as the United States Supreme Court Edwards v. Aguillard ruling, which barred the teaching of \"creation science\" in public schools as breaching the separation of church and state.The first significant published use of intelligent design was in Of Pandas and People, a 1989 textbook intended for high-school biology classes. It seeks to redefine science in a fundamental way that would invoke supernatural explanations, a viewpoint known as theistic science. It puts forward a number of arguments, the most prominent of which are irreducible complexity and specified complexity, in support of the existence of a designer.\n From the mid-1990s, intelligent design proponents were supported by the Discovery Institute which, together with its Center for Science and Culture, planned and funded the \"intelligent design movement\".They advocated inclusion of intelligent design in public school curricula, leading to the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial, where U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III ruled that intelligent design is not science, that it \"cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents\", and that the school district's promotion of it therefore violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n \n http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/kitzmiller/kitzmiller_342.pdf\n Intelligent design - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n In other words Intelligent Designers are simply put, Creationists who were upset because the Government said teaching creation was not Science so Creation was removed from school studies. A group of Creationists came up with \" intelligent design\" and tried to pass it off as science in an attempt to get \" GOD\" put back into Public Schools.

Someone who believes that there is anything outside that box is a supernaturalist.\n \n Thanks for your patience; I try to be clear.\n\n I see, so supernatural gains meaning by defining a set of existents and then proposing that something exists beyond that?\n \n I have long thought that this in itself is a peculiarity of mystical assertion. i.e. something that would only occur to someone if they already assumed mysticism.\n \n Let me explain.\n \n If one was defining nature why would one stop short of saying 'all that exists'?\n \n I believe the answer is that they have already setup (regardless of the self-contradiction) a differentiation in their mind between physical reality and spiritual reality. Where spiritual reality (in their minds) takes on the fuzzy definition of 'that which is real but not real'; content to maintain the reality of this set of existents by faith or a definitional maze.\n \n This has many functions for mystics but the most important one is to clearly define what needs to taken on faith and what one actually has to know because of their own senses.\n \n Let's look at it a different way, let's treat all  reality with the eye of scientist.\n \n If nature or the universe is defined as all that exists, no matter what we find nor what natural laws are discovered it will be 'inside the box', the box will simply expand.\n \n If we find a God who designed the rest of the known universe but self-generated himself we could certainly categorize him as a unique part of nature but if he exists (they say he does) he is part of the universe.\n \n It is therefore premise two that establishes supernaturalism but on a connection that doesn't exist in the real world, namely that it makes any more sense if god spontaneously generated the universe 'from the outside' than if god as part of the universe spontaneously generated the rest.\n \n We cannot escape the primary dichotomy. Either existence in some form always existed; or it spontaneously generated.\n \n It is just a 'jedi mind trick' to think we've solved it by defining existents which have many of the laws of reality absent from them.",

She is the reason I stopped actually taking the time to answer creationist questions as if I were writing a technical paper - I was answering one of her questions with citations and explanations and quotations from the primary literature, etc. I wrote it first in Word, and it ended up being 7 or 8 pages or something. Bertvan replied with a one-sentence blow-off, claiming that I did not really answer her question.\n \n So thanks, BerthaJane - you taught me that creationists of all stripes are by and large disingenuous and not interested in having their disinformation corrected, and I see that in all the time since I last encountered you, you have not learned a thing.\n \n Lucky accidents in the thousands in the proper order?\n \n How can anyone who pretends to know about evolution write something so completely idiotic and absurd?",
