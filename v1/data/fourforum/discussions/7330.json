   "In 1993 the Supreme Court charged trial judges with the responsibility of ensuring that any and all scientific testimony or evidence presented to a jury is not only relevant, but reliable (Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 509 U.S. 579 (1993)). The original case and the appeal were decided on the basis of a precedent (Frye v. United States, 54 App. D.C. 46, 47, 293 F. 1013, 1014) that decided that scientific testimony should meet some \"general acceptance\" standard for admission of expert testimony. The appeal the the Supreme Court was based on the assertion that the precedent had been superseded by adoption of the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically, Rule 702. The Supreme Court agreed but found that Federal Rules of Evidence required judges to determine whether the \"...reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid, and...whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.\" So even though the decision was based on superseded precedent, the decision was correct and a correct application of judicial discretion according to the rules of evidence.\n \n Justice Breyer encouraged judges to seek the opinions of independent experts to help them in such decisions, from such organizations as the National Academy of Sciences or the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n \n In 2002, probably because they are still faced with the problem, a group of federal judges asked Dr. Robert L. Park (professor of physics at the University of Maryland since 1974 and Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science) for advice on how to recognize questionable scientific claims (henceforward referred to as bogus science or pseudoscience). His name was probably brought to the attention of the judges by the publication of Dr. Park's book, Voodoo Science: The Road From Foolishness to Fraud (Oxford University Press, 2000).\n \n Dr. Park responded with a list of the Seven Warning Sign of Bogus Science. I present here only the seven items, although Dr. Park did give some brief explanation of each. All in all, the list barely exceeds a single page.\n \n The Seven Warning Signs of Bogus Science\n \n 1. The discoverer pitches the claim directly to the media.\n \n 2. The discoverer says that a powerful establishment is trying to suppress his or her work.\n \n 3. The scientific effect involved is always at the very limit of detection.\n \n 4. Evidence for a discovery is anecdotal.\n \n 5. The discoverer says a belief is credible because it has endured for centuries.\n \n 6. The discoverer has worked in isolation.\n \n 7. The discoverer must propose new laws of nature to explain an observation.\n \n Keep in mind that these are warning signs and that violation of one or more should make one wary of acceptance without meaningful scientific support. It does not invalidate the science out of hand. After all, science is what scientists do, and sometimes good scientists do good science and report it badly.\n \n So what do you think? Consider these points in light of the claims of \"creation science\" of the likes of Hovind, Ham, Henry & John Morris, Sarfati, Baugh, Patton, Dembski and so on. Feel free to include discussion of UFOs, Mars civilizations, 100 mpg cars, suppressed miracle drugs, etc. I'll expand with Dr. Park's comments as well as my own views as discussion continues.\n \n For example, do you remember the \"cold fusion\" story? That violated signs 1, 2, and 3.",

   "Dr. Park's list can be compared with the Baloney Detection Kit which Carl Sagan (in his book 'The Demon Haunted World') suggested as tools for testing arguments and detecting fallacious or fraudulent arguments.\n \n Compare:\n \n Wherever possible there must be independent confirmation of the facts:\n \n \u0095 Encourage substantive debate on the evidence by knowledgeable proponents of all points of view.\n \n \u0095 Arguments from authority carry little weight (in science there are no \"authorities\").\n \n \u0095 Spin more than one hypothesis - don't simply run with the first idea that caught your fancy.\n \n \u0095 Try not to get overly attached to a hypothesis just because it's yours.\n \n \u0095 Quantify, wherever possible.\n \n \u0095 If there is a chain of argument every link in the chain must work.\n \n \u0095 \"Occam's razor\" - if there are two hypothesis that explain the data equally well choose the simpler.\n \n \u0095 Ask whether the hypothesis can, at least in principle, be falsified (shown to be false by some unambiguous test).

All in all, the list barely exceeds a single page.\n \n The Seven Warning Signs of Bogus Science\n \n 1. The discoverer pitches the claim directly to the media.\n\n \n I would change that slightly because \"media\" could be taken to mean the press. I'd change it to something like \"The discoverer pitches the claim directly to the media and/or the general public\". \n \n Dr. Behe wrote \"Darwin's Black Box\" for the general uneducated public, gives lectures at churches, and makes videos for the \"ID ThinkTank\" ARN: he did not and has not published his \"IC theory\" in peer-reviewed scientific journalsm.\n \n \n2. The discoverer says that a powerful establishment is trying to suppress his or her work.\n\n \n Behe does this too, in his book aimed at the general, uneducated public...\n \n \nThe result of these cumulative efforts to investigate the cell - to investigate life at the molecular level - is a loud, clear, piercing cry of \"design!\". The result is so unambiguoug and so significant that ti must be ranked as one of the greatest achievements in the history of science. ... This triumph of science should evoke cries of \"Eureka!\" from ten thousand throats, should occasion much hand-slapping and high-fiving, and perhaps even be an excuse to take a day off.\n \n But no bottles have been uncorked, no hands slapped. Instead, a curoious, embarrassed silence surrounds the stark complexity of the cell. When the subject comes up in public, feet start to shuffle, and breathing gets a bit labored. ...\n \n Why does the scientific community not greedily embrace its startling discovery? Why is the observation of design handled with intellectual gloves? The dilemma is that while one side of the elephant is labeled intelligent design, the other side might be labeled God.\n (Michael Behe, Darwin's Black Box, Free Press, 1996, p232-233)\n \n\n \n He goes on to talk about \"scientific chauvinism\" and other ideas the keep the scientific community oppressing his astonishing finding.\n \n \n3. The scientific effect involved is always at the very limit of detection.\n\n \n Well, in the sense that we cannot actually detect the intelligent design Behe proposes, then it it OUTSIDE the limit of actual detection. \n \n \n4. Evidence for a discovery is anecdotal.\n\n \n How about analogical? Mousetraps, Mt. Rushmore, watches. \n \n \n5. The discoverer says a belief is credible because it has endured for centuries.\n\n \n That is what the following essentially amounts to: that believe in God as designer has been around so long that it has become deeply engrained in our society, as well as resorting to popularity among the general public...\n \n \n\"Polls show that more 90 percent of Americans believe in God, and that about half attend religious services regularly. Politicians invoke the name of God with great regularity (more often around election time). Many football coaches pray with their teams before games, musicians compose humns, artists paint pictures of religious events, organizations of businessmen gather for prayers. Hospitals and airports have chapels; the army and Congross employ chaplains. As a country we honot people, such as Martin Luther King, whose actions were deeply rooted in religion. With all of this public affirmation, why should science find it difficult to accept a theory that supports what most people believe anyway?\"\n (Michael Behe, Darwin's Black Box, Free Press, 1996, p233) \n\n \n I could say more, but gotta run.",

I even pointed out that it appeared that Dembski thought that there were only three laws of thermodynamics and claimed to have discovered a 4th (which he of course named the 4th law of thermodynamics). He seems unaware of the zeroth law.\n\n \n Well, I was kind of hoping that my questioning would encourage you to provide a quote to show us exactly what Dembski himself said, but I guess I wasn't blunt enough.\n \n You've now made it clear that your claim - which is still unsupported - is that Dembski says a fourth law of thermodynamics, and not the fourth law of thermodynamics. But that still would not necessarily make Dembski wrong. \n \n Does Dembki's wording show he means a fourth law-of-thermodynamics, or a fourth-law-of-thermodynamics? The first would be wrong but the second would be right. \n \n To try to make this clearer:\n ..... We have a zeroth law of thermodynamics.\n ..... We have a first law of thermodynamics.\n ..... We have a second law of thermodynamics.\n ..... We have a third law of thermodynamics.\n ..... Dembski claims to have uncovered a fourth law of the thermodynamics.\n \n If his actual statements can be read in that sense, then his claiming to have come up with a fourth law of thermodynamics does not show ignorance, on his part, of their already being 4 laws of thermodynamics.\n \n \n \n And as I suggested in my post, here is Stuart Kauffman, who is clearly neither a Creationist nor an ID Creationist, speaking of his attempts to uncover a fourth law of thermodynamics...\n \n \n\"My first efforts had begun with twin questions. First, in addition to the known laws of thermodynamics, could there possibly be a fourth law of thermodynamics ...\"\n (emphasis added, Investigations, Stuart Kauffman, Oxford University Press, 2000, p2) \n\n \n There are two ways that can be taken, and we should not force the speaker to be wrong by forcing the one interpretation that would make him wrong - that he does not know that there are already 4 laws of thermodynamics. We should give him the benefit of the doubt, and interpret his statement in the second way, that keeps it correct: we should read it as I explained above, as a fourth-law-of-thermodynamics, and not as a fourth law-of-thermodynamics.\n \n As this example shows, even quoting Dembski saying that he believes he's found \"a fourth law of thermodynamics\" would not show him to be wrong: we should give him the benefit of the doubt too. Only if his wording makes it clear that he doesn't know that 4 laws of thermodynamics already exist should we conclude that he is wrong.\n \n \n \n At this point you've made an assertion of someone being wrong without offering any supporting evidence. The rational person should not blindly accept that Dembski is wrong: evidence is needed.",
