   "[B]So you have nothing beyond lack of insurance caused by poor life choices then.\n\n \n That is not the case. These factors, including others mentioned on this thread, were taken into consideration and controlled for in the study as described in the summary I linked.\n \n \n\n \n SEPTEMBER 17, 2009\n \n DAVID CECERE\n CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE\n \n Nearly 45,000 annual deaths are associated with lack of health insurance, according to a new study published online today by the American Journal of Public Health. That figure is about two and a half times higher than an estimate from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 2002.\n \n The study, conducted at Harvard Medical School and Cambridge Health Alliance, found that uninsured, working-age Americans have a 40 percent higher risk of death than their privately insured counterparts, up from a 25 percent excess death rate found in 1993.\n \n &#8220;The uninsured have a higher risk of death when compared to the privately insured, even after taking into account socioeconomics, health behaviors, and baseline health,&#8221; said lead author Andrew Wilper, M.D., who currently teaches at the University of Washington School of Medicine. &#8220;We doctors have many new ways to prevent deaths from hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease &#8212; but only if patients can get into our offices and afford their medications.&#8221;\n \n The study, which analyzed data from national surveys carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), assessed death rates after taking into account education, income, and many other factors, including smoking, drinking, and obesity. It estimated that lack of health insurance causes 44,789 excess deaths annually.\n \n Previous estimates from the IOM and others had put that figure near 18,000. The methods used in the current study were similar to those employed by the IOM in 2002, which in turn were based on a pioneering 1993 study of health insurance and mortality.\n \n Deaths associated with lack of health insurance now exceed those caused by many common killers such as kidney disease. An increase in the number of uninsured and an eroding medical safety net for the disadvantaged likely explain the substantial increase in the number of deaths, as the uninsured are more likely to go without needed care. Another factor contributing to the widening gap in the risk of death between those who have insurance and those who do not is the improved quality of care for those who can get it.\n \n The researchers analyzed U.S. adults under age 65 who participated in the annual National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) between 1986 and 1994. Respondents first answered detailed questions about their socioeconomic status and health and were then examined by physicians. The CDC tracked study participants to see who died by 2000.\n \n The study found a 40 percent increased risk of death among the uninsured. As expected, death rates were also higher for males (37 percent increase), current or former smokers (102 percent and 42 percent increases), people who said that their health was fair or poor (126 percent increase), and those who examining physicians said were in fair or poor health (222 percent increase).\n \n Steffie Woolhandler, study co-author, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a primary care physician at Cambridge Health Alliance, noted: &#8220;Historically, every other developed nation has achieved universal health care through some form of nonprofit national health insurance. Our failure to do so means that all Americans pay higher health care costs, and 45,000 pay with their lives.&#8221;\n \n &#8220;The Institute of Medicine, using older studies, estimated that one American dies every 30 minutes from lack of health insurance,&#8221; remarked David Himmelstein, study co-author, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a primary care physician at Cambridge Health Alliance. &#8220;Even this grim figure is an underestimate &#8212; now one dies every 12 minutes.&#8221;\n \n Other authors include Karen E. Lasser, Danny McCormick, David H. Bor, and David U. Himmelstein. The study was supported by a National Service Research Award. @http://www.harvardscience.harvard.edu/medicine-health/articles/new-study-finds-45000-deaths-annually-linked-lack-health-coverage\n\n \n What does this mean? It means, for example, that there is a certain rate of death for kidney disease, in and of itself. For smokers, for heart disease, for obesity, for diabetes, etc. However, if you are uninsured, there is an even higher rate.\n \n IOW, pick a death, just about any preventable death, between these two groups -- the insured and the uninsured. Who dies at a higher rate?",

I also loved math and science. Medicine was a career that allowed me to combine both my interests.\n \n Dr. Stephanie J. Woolhandler advocates guaranteed access to health care for all members of society, including the forty-two million Americans currently without medical insurance. In 1986 she helped found Physicians for a National Health Program, a not-for-profit organization for physicians, medical students, and other health care professionals who advocate a national health insurance program.\n \n Stephanie Woolhandler was born in Shreveport, Louisiana in 1951 and earned her bachelor's degree at Stanford University in California in 1975. She graduate with her doctor of medicine degree from Louisiana State University School of Medicine in 1979. She returned to the West Coast for her internship and residency at the University of California-San Francisco, and earned her master's degree in public health at the University of California-Berkeley. In 1983 Dr. Woolhandler moved to Massachusetts and began a medical residency at The Cambridge Hospital, where she served as the National Health Services Research Fellow in general internal medicine from 1986 to 1987. During this time she credits Dr. Robert S. Lawrence, chief of medicine, with helping her develop a vision of how she could combine her social activism with a medical career.\n \n Dr. Woolhandler originally envisioned a life of service to the poor where she would be providing hands-on care. Explaining her choice of medicine as a career she recalled, \"After several years of working in the movement against the Vietnam War, I sought a career that would allow me to continue my work for social change. I also loved math and science. Medicine was a career that allowed me to combine both my interests...I could reach a large audience for progressive ideas by publishing in medical journals such as the New England Journal of Medicine and the JAMA.\" \n \n On the Harvard faculty since 1987, Dr. Woolhandler has conducted research and published her results in dozens of articles, chapters, and books, including Bleeding the Patient:The Consequences of Corporate Health Care, published in 2000. Studying the inequalities in health and health care, administrative costs in medicine, and national health insurance, she promotes a national health program with a single payer system. Towards that end, she helped found Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP) in 1986, a not-for-profit organization of physicians, medical students, and other health care professionals who support a national health insurance program. Since that time, PNHP has flourished and now numbers about ten thousand physicians who support national non-profit health insurance.\n \n Still providing patient care as an attending physician at The Cambridge Hospital, Dr. Woolhandler also serves as chair of the academic promotions committee. At Harvard she serves as co-director of the school's general internal medicine fellowship program. Numerous honors and awards have recognized her contributions to health care. In 1990 she was the Robert Wood Johnson Health Policy Fellow for the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences. In 1994 she received the Edward K. Barsky Award from the Physicians Forum and in 1996 the Ethical Culture Society named her \"Humanist of the Year.\"\n \n Stephanie Woolhandler | HarvardScience\n\n \n She's a former peacenik turned national healthcare activist.

   "Study links 45,000 U.S. deaths to lack of insurance\n By Susan Heavey \n \n WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nearly 45,000 people die in the United States each year - one every 12 minutes - in large part because they lack health insurance and can not get good care, Harvard Medical School researchers found in an analysis released on Thursday. \n \n \"We're losing more Americans every day because of inaction ... than drunk driving and homicide combined,\" Dr. David Himmelstein, a co-author of the study and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard, said in an interview with Reuters...\n \n The Harvard study, funded by a federal research grant, was published in the online edition of the American Journal of Public Health. It was released by Physicians for a National Health Program, which favors government-backed or \"single-payer\" health insurance. \n \n An [sic] similar study in 1993 found those without insurance had a 25 percent greater risk of death, according to the Harvard group. The Institute of Medicine later used that data in its 2002 estimate showing about 18,000 people a year died because they lacked coverage. \n \n Part of the increased risk now is due to the growing ranks of the uninsured, Himmelstein said. Roughly 46.3 million people in the United States lacked coverage in 2008, the U.S. Census Bureau reported last week, up from 45.7 million in 2007. \n \n Another factor is that there are fewer places for the uninsured to get good care. Public hospitals and clinics are shuttering or scaling back across the country in cities like New Orleans, Detroit and others, he said. \n \n Study co-author Dr. Steffie Woolhandler said the findings show that without proper care, uninsured people are more likely to die from complications associated with preventable diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. \n \n Some critics called the study flawed. \n \n The National Center for Policy Analysis, a Washington think tank that backs a free-market approach to health care, said researchers overstated the death risk and did not track how long subjects were uninsured. \n \n Woolhandler said that while Physicians for a National Health Program supports government-backed coverage, the Harvard study's six researchers closely followed the methodology used in the 1993 study conducted by researchers in the federal government as well as the University of Rochester in New York. \n \n The Harvard researchers analyzed data on about 9,000 patients tracked by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics through the year 2000. They excluded older Americans because those aged 65 or older are covered by the U.S. Medicare insurance program...\n \n We question of the timing of this report. And we also question the numbers.\n \n The Institute of Medicine later used that data in its 2002 estimate showing about 18,000 people a year died because they lacked coverage. \n \n We are supposed to believe that the number of those dying from lack of insurance coverage has far more than doubled in just six years? Six years of unprecedented prosperity and high employment?\n \n Or should we instead believe that these numbers are just pulled out of thin air? For some reason we are leaning towards the latter position.\n \n As we have previously noted, the Census Bureau's website provides some numbers about the uninsured from 2007 and 2008:\n \n Health Insurance Coverage: 2008\n The percentage of people without health insurance in 2008 was not statistically different from 2007 at 15.4 percent... \n The number of people with health insurance increased to 255.1 million in 2008 - up from 253.4 million in 2007... The number of people covered by government health insurance increased to 87.4 million - up from 83.0 million in 2007... \n The percentage of people covered by government health insurance programs increased to 29.0 percent in 2008, from 27.8 percent in 2007. The percentage and the number of people covered by Medicaid increased to 14.1 percent and 42.6 million in 2008, from 13.2 percent and 39.6 million in 2007. The percentage and number of people covered by Medicare increased to 14.3 percent and 43.0 million in 2008, from 13.8 percent and 41.4 million in 2007. \n In 2008, the percentage and number of children under 18 without health insurance were 9.9 percent and 7.3 million, lower than they were in 2007 at 11.0 percent and 8.1 million. The uninsured rate and the number of uninsured for children are the lowest since 1987, the first year that comparable health insurance data were collected... \n The uninsured rate and number of uninsured for non-Hispanic Whites increased in 2008 to 10.8 percent and 21.3 million, from 10.4 percent and 20.5 million in 2007... \n The percentage of uninsured Hispanics decreased to 30.7 percent in 2008, from 32.1 percent in 2007... \n We are especially skeptical of the '45,000 deaths a year' claim after having paid a visit to the website of the organization which did this study, Physicians for a National Health Program - Health Care Is A Human Right. (That is the name of their site.)\n \n On their front page we found this announcement:\n \n Our Mission: Single-Payer National Health Insurance\n The U.S. spends twice as much as other industrialized nations on health care, $7,129 per capita. Yet our system performs poorly in comparison and still leaves 45.7 million without health coverage and millions more inadequately covered.\n \n This is because private insurance bureaucracy and paperwork consume one-third (31 percent) of every health care dollar. Streamlining payment through a single nonprofit payer would save more than $400 billion per year, enough to provide comprehensive, high-quality coverage for all Americans...\n \n We also found this \"action alert\" from one of the 'researchers' herself:\n \n Dear President Obama: endorse single payer \n Read and sign the Open Letter\n \n Tell President Obama that single-payer health reform is the only practicable way to achieve his stated goal of universal, comprehensive coverage at an affordable price. \n \n Only single payer, by redirecting the vast sums wasted annually on bureaucracy and paperwork back into care, can assure high-quality coverage for everyone with no net increase in U.S. health spending. Only single payer can rein in costs. \n \n Lesser reforms, with or without a \"public option,\" won't fix our broken system. \n \n Read and sign the Open Letter\n \n Drs.

This will cause your \"balanced design\" to become clearly unbalanced. \n To the layman, this would be like carrying out a study on human's ability to differentiate colors, choosing a high % of men for the study (knowing they are more likely to be color-blind) and then making a conclusion about all humans ability to differentiate colors based on a flawed population sampling. \n I've seen this type of sampling error made many times by people that don't take into account other potential influential factors when they design their experiments. In this case, where the study is a paper exercise only, the manipulation is, IMO, deliberate. \n A truely balanced study would have taken the same % of whites, blacks and Hispanics for the \"insured\" and \"uninsured\" groups and not resorted to over-sampling of one group and undersampling the other.",

No other advanced western nation in the world today fails to recognize the importance of universal health care.\n \n Let's look at some of stories that you perceive only as \"poor life choices\":\n \n \nMy younger brother, a combat decorated veteran of the Vietnam conflict, died three weeks after being diagnosed with colon cancer. He was laid off from his job and could not afford COBRA coverage. When he was in enough pain to see a doctor, it was too late. He left a wife and two teenage sons in the prime of his life at 50 years old. The attending doctor said that if he had only sought treatment earlier he would still be alive.\n Jim,\n Swanton, Vt.\n \n I can tell you a story about a beautiful, intelligent, hard working small business owner who died because she couldn't afford to buy health insurance for her family nor her employees. She was 53 and I will never forgive my county for allowing the greed of the insurance companies to limit her opportunity for preventable health care. A colonoscopy at 50 would have saved her life.\n Teresa,\n Eagle, Idaho\n \n I work with low-income families, and last week a student in my school lost his mother. The family does not have access to quality medical help. The mom was diabetic. She could get into a doctor, but the wait time was immense. She needed to lose money from her paycheck in order to get a prescription filled. She also had to pay for the prescription out of pocket. As a result, she went without checkups and\n medicine.... A mother went without her medicine. A little girl and a little boy will grow up without a mother. This is shameful. Shameful! I have had enough.\n Dex, Bellingham, Wash.\n \n I need a colonoscopy every five years. This year, I need to do it. My wife needs one too. We are insured by Blue Cross, and these procedures are not covered and beyond what we can afford, so we are not getting them. It is a bit like Russian roulette, and we know it, but times are tough, and we can't afford it. We need help because we are under-insured. Please help!\n Brian,\n South Pomfret, Vt.\n \n My son, 23 years old, is a volunteer fire fighter, part-time EMT and Paramedic. He had to go to the hospital a year ago and he had no insurance. Meanwhile, he has been trying to get a full-time job. So he has had to pay what he can, when he can on his medical bills. My question is, why a young man who risks his life to save individuals would not be covered at all? These men and women risk their lives every day. It does not make sense to me that someone who is in this type of occupation would not be covered. It is a shame this country does not take care of these men and women as they should. They are taken for granted... By the way, my son saved a life yesterday.\n Karen, Fort Pierce, Fla.\n \n My partner has AIDS. We can't afford his prescriptions. We make too much for any assistance from the AIDS organizations or the state, and our health plan pays only 50 percent of the retail cost. That would be over $2,000 a month. I have to split my diabetes medicine to make it last because it is too expensive every month. We postpone care because our deductible is so high, and sometimes the care isn't covered anyway.\n Steve,\n South Burlington, Vt.\n \n My son is 35. Has worked all his life in a well-paid field but always as a \"contractor\" (used by employers to avoid offering benefits) and has been unable to get health insurance at a reasonable price. He has been to the ER (heart attack) three times in the last year at a cost of over $100,000 each time. He will never be able to buy a house or even a decent car as it will take him 10-20 years to pay this off, providing his health returns.\n Graham, Pecos, N.M.\n \n When I couldn't afford insurance a few years ago, at age 38, I ended up with an infected gallbladder. I'm very healthy, very active, but inherited a faulty organ. I'm now tens of thousands of dollars in debt. I will never own my own home. I will never have good credit. Not because I shopped too much, or spent beyond my means, but because I almost died in a freak situation when I had no health insurance. Every day I'm hounded by bill collectors who are threatening and mean, causing that much more stress in my daily life of work, mothering, trying to get by. I don't even have the available money to try and file bankruptcy -- if the current laws would even let me. Once again, the system is set up to reward the wealthy institutions and absolutely destroy citizens.\n Erin, Alameda, Calif.\n \n Recently, when I could afford health care, the cost was $2,912 per year for my wife and I and that had a $5,000 deductible with no dental coverage. Now we cannot even afford dental care because it&#8217;s too expensive, we just wait until the teeth crack or break and we find a dentist who will pull them instead of getting them fixed. $180 per tooth. When we were young we had insurance and raised four children. We have both worked and getting on at 60 with layoffs, economic stresses. We surely need some help, with a single-payer health care program.\n Peter,\n Essex Jct., Vt.\n \n I am covered by a wonderful government plan &#8211; Medicare &#8211;, but my son, who is 50, with a master&#8217;s degree in technology and unemployed for the last 10 months, is finding the cost of health insurance unaffordable. My daughter, who is self-employed, had a bout with cancer 15 years ago. She is paying an astronomical amount for a plan with a very high deductible but she&#8217;s lucky to have that. This is nuts in a country like ours.\n Loren, Victoria, Minn.\n \n My wife has not been to the doctor&#8217;s office in over 10 years because she can't afford it. I get my medical at the VA, because I am a veteran. It is not right for people like my wife to be without health care.\n Kevin,\n Bradford, Vt.\n \n I wish I did have a story to share about the insurance companies. But I cannot afford insurance; I am a mother of a disabled child. He has the medical card and the government does a wonderful job at getting what my son needs, but me the mother of this child who will have to take care of him until the day I die has no insurance because of the income limit for my son to have the government funded medical card.\n Cindy,\n New Iberia, La.\n \n I followed my dream of starting my own company and being self employed. For many years, however, this meant that I went without health insurance because I could not afford it. With a history of cancer in my family I lived day to day trying not to think of a test I was a year overdue on having. Also, I worried if I said too much at a doctor's appointment or had something diagnosed while I was uninsured that I would be stuck with a pre-existing condition that would prevent me from affordable care when someday I would be able to get insurance. Late at night I would still have thoughts creep into my head that I was knowingly letting something happen that could kill me and leave my 9-year-old daughter without a father.\n Scott,\n Fort Wayne, Ind.\n \n My family and I pray every day that nothing will happen to us medically. We pay for regular doctor visits out of our own pockets, but we only go when we can afford to. I am unable to afford the annual tests that I need for the control of my hypertension. I do not get tests that are recommended for women my age. When something really awful happens, we go to the emergency room and then have been unable to pay those exorbitant and outrageous costs.\n Rebecca, Okeechobee, Fla.\n \n We have great health insurance through my wife's employer. My 24 year old daughter has been diagnosed with persistent daily headaches, for which there is no known cure&#8230;She has had all the tests and has tried more different drugs than I can count. She is covered under my wife's insurance until she is 25. Our fear is that in 10 months, when she turns 25, she will become one of the uninsured or underinsured as this will be a pre-existing condition and the meds she is on are expensive.\n William,\n Milwaukee, Wis.\n \n I am currently unemployed but even when I was employed, I could not afford insurance for myself let alone my wife and three boys. I am 49 years old. I haven't been to a doctor is 15 years. If I get sick...I do over the counter. I've gotten cut and actually sewed up the injury with a needle and thread myself. Sad but true.\n Harold,\n Bristow, Okla.\n \n I'm active duty military. I have served in the Air Force for almost 13 years now. I have \"government\" medical coverage, I may have minor complaints here and there but over all I would say that it's a good system. Seeing how much money my parents pay for health care makes my blood boil. I fail to see the difference between the insurance companies and a mugger who holds a gun to your head demanding \"your money or your life.\" On the flip side of that, my sister and her husband who live just outside of Toronto. They have a special needs child and all of their medical needs are taken care of.\n Joshua, Danby, Vt.\n \n After having breast cancer in 1988, I found it impossible to obtain health care insurance because of a \"pre-existing condition\". My husband quit his partnership in a law firm and took a job with a national accounting firm so that I could receive good health coverage.\n Jana,\n Adamant, Vt.\n \n After an injury I was unemployed, partially disabled and now am broke and mired in medical bills. Bill collectors call every day. My wife and I both have \"pre-existing conditions,\" which in Washington state does not preclude you for getting\n insurance, it just makes it expensive beyond belief and has huge deductibles. Often we are forced to choose between getting her prescriptions and paying a utility. To renew her prescriptions (every 3 months) we need to go to the doctor and pay him the equivalent of a week and a half worth of our food budget. Likely we will be forced to file bankruptcy because of the medical bills. Three years ago I had a good job, insurance and some money in savings. Now we are broke, riddled with debt and just trying to keep the lights on. At 51, this was not how I envisioned spending my \"Golden Years\".\n Gareth, Lynden, Wash.\n \n More than 20 years ago my wife, in a routine physical, had a note put on her medical records that she may require a hysterectomy one day. A month or two after that exam, her health insurance rates began doubling every month and continued until I could not afford her insurance any longer. That is when I found out what a preexisting condition can do to your health care premiums.\n Larry, Nevis, Minn.\n \n My daughter was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 22, just when she was finishing college and launching into her own life to be self-supporting. Not only was she unable to find a job that included health benefits; she could not make enough to pay the enormous cost of daily care and regular visits to a doctor in order to learn how to control this life threatening condition. As a result she put her expenses for diabetes on her credit care and soon found herself with an unpayable balance of over $14,000 with over 20 percent interest added. She became depressed and overwhelmed and said to me sadly, \"Mom, I know they will never find a cure for diabetes in my lifetime because they make too much money on supplies and treatment.\"\n Marilyn,\n West Halifax, Vt.\n \n I had a procedure in 1999 when I had health insurance and the doctors said I would need follow-up care for the rest of my life. In 2003, when I lost my health care through divorce, I was deemed uninsurable and haven't had the follow-up care\n I need. I live paycheck to paycheck, week to week, and there isn't any money for the care I need. When I'm sick I still have to work, there is no waiting list because the time limit for when I can afford to see a doctor is \"never.\" I'm praying for single payer health care so I can see a doctor and have a chance at a long healthy life and see my grandkids grow up.\n Brenda, Crestview, Fla.\n \n I have a child who had to be intensive care for 5 days after his birth. He is fine now. It became my full time job fighting the health insurance company to get them to pay. I went for a routine physical, which is supposed to be covered under our insurance, and once again I had to fight to get them to pay. I don't want to go to the doctor because of the cost and the runaround from the insurance company. The 2 boys are covered under Dr. Dynosaur which is a huge blessing! Please pass the universal health care package.\n Beth,\n Windsor, Vt.\n \n I worked as a registered nurse in hospitals for 31 years. I had to retire early due to my health. I cannot get any kind of health insurance because of \"pre-existing conditions\" thanks to the high blood pressure from a stressful job.\n Susan, Pinole, Calif.\n \n I am self-employed and my wife is chronically ill. Medical insurance is our largest monthly bill -- bigger than food, housing, anything. What's more, our insurer (VT Blue Cross Blue Shield) routinely tries denying payment for services. For example, less than a year ago my wife went for physician-prescribed brain scans at UMass Amherst medical center. She called BCBS before going, explicitly to verify that the tests would be covered; she even got the procedure code number and verified coverage. But when the bill came, BCBS tried to deny coverage for these exact tests. Eventually, after many wasted hours that were literally painful for my wife, who suffers from chronic fatigue, we squeezed payment out of BCBS.\n And this is normal. It is clearly the insurance companies' policy to try denying coverage as often as possible, for any reason or no reason, and then to give in and pay when someone fights back hard enough and long enough. People who are too sick or inexperienced or uneducated to fight that hard get stuck with the bill -- which translates directly into income for the insurer. In a for-profit health care insurance system, this is totally logical. Money is made by denying care, not giving it -- how else?\n Larry,\n Sharon, Vt.\n \n I lived in Canada for 3 years and found the single-payer system to be wonderful. I live in the states and see a worship of profit, and normal people suffering as a result. Why are we supporting this whole layer of profit-making insurance companies with our health care dollars?\n Marilyn,\n Corinth, Vt.\n \n The experience I had was consulting on a child who had lived at the local Children's Hospital for eight years after she developed spinal meningitis at the age of six months in 2002. Her mother was informed that she could not get a job or the little girl would lose her Medicaid coverage, and no company would give the girl insurance coverage because of her pre-existing condition. The mother abandoned her in the hospital. She was cognitively intact when I asked her if the hospital was her home. She assured me that \"Nobody lives in a hospital. Everybody goes home someday\". Maureen, Austin, Texas\n \n My husband had a stroke and the cost of his health care now is appalling. Stroke survivors are also victims of a health care system that cuts them off if progress is slow, as it is for most brain injuries. Families are left on their own to go bankrupt. One hopes their money lasts but it is a race to see if the savings will last until death. And money worries add to the stress of the horrible situation. A single payer health system will help cut the costs and stress of those of us burdened with on-going and persistent health issues that our loved ones face. Do something.\n Marla, San Mateo, Calif.\n \n I am paying more than $3,200 per month for our high deductible family plan -Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of NJ. It costs more than I earn and so we have to use our IRA money to pay for it. My husband left me and is getting a divorce because he is sick of paying \"my Cadillac health insurance that has not resulted in me getting any better.\"\n Marsha,\n Princeton, N.J.\n \n I am originally from Canada and see the effects of the American system's failures every day. I've had great care from my employer, but at a direct cost to me and my employer that, combined, is close to ten times what my employer paid on my behalf back in Alberta. I can't stress enough how the worries about health care in the U.S. shape the everyday lives of Americans and American business in ways that Canadians can't even truly comprehend. Not having to worry about the financial costs of getting sick or going to your doctor or whether or not you can \"afford\" to change jobs or start your own business is something Canadians experience without even knowing it. Imagine how much capital would be freed up if companies and individuals didn't spend so much of their money covering the basic costs of health care. This myth about the U.S. having the best or even one of the better health care systems in the world doesn't stand up to scrutiny for even a moment if you've experienced the systems of another country. The US could do much, much better and be an example for the world of how to do things right rather than the prime example of how best to do things horribly ineffectively. I am quite happy living in Vermont, but I know that if anyone in my family got seriously ill we'd quickly be headed back across the border for good.\n Paul, South Burlington, Vt.\n \n Both my husband and I have insurance through our employers. When my husband had to have emergency surgery, we ended up in debt that we have no way to pay because health care is so expensive that even with insurance, we can't afford it.\n No one should be faced with thousands of dollars in bills when they pay to be insured. Marlene, Enosburg Falls, Vt.\n \n I pay $12,000+ per year for family health care insurance. I have what many would consider good health coverage. We are also a pretty healthy family and don't go to the doctor much or use many of those health care insurance dollars. However, when we do need it, we face a nightmare of double and triple billings for medical services that should be covered. Expenses we are told are not covered or require a new deductible that wasn't present before. Re-billing and re-billing with the apparent hope we will pay rather than try to figure out the labyrinth billing system. It has taken us literally years to straighten some bills out with our insurance company. Talk about choice --we are restricted to the doctors \"in system\". Unless we can get prior approval to see a doctor \"out of system\" we are out of luck -- it is not covered.\n Peter,\n Lexington, Ky.\n \n The sister in law of one of my co-workers is a 42 year old single mom who was just diagnosed with breast cancer which has spread to her brain. She has two young kids and was given 3-6 months to live. She is insured, but the co-pays and deductibles are so enormous that she is being forced to file for bankruptcy. Imagine facing death knowing you have 2 young kids. That is bad enough, but add to that financial troubles which have magnified this already horrendous situation. It is a national disgrace.\n Deb,\n Montpelier, Vt.\n \n Twenty years ago I had a software consulting business that was quite successful. It was a sole proprietorship with a good steady income and a manageable set of clients. I needed health insurance for my family but my daughter has a genetic defect that potentially might lead to medical expenses. I could not buy insurance for my family. I was willing to pay whatever it might cost but no insurance company would write the policy. After a year I finally decided I could no longer put my family at risk. I closed my business and took a job with a large company that had a health plan. How many small businesses close each year because we have no national health system?\n Richard,\n Reno, Nev.\n\n \n These are real problems, not what you call \"drivel to back up your sick agenda.\"\n \n If anything is sick, it is the system and the inability of people like yourself to see the suffering of those who cannot get health care when they need it.\n \n In the words of Bob Dylan, \"How many times must a man turn his head and pretend that he just doesn't see?\"\n \n YouTube - Bob Dylan - Blowin In the Wind - 1963",

   "At the time of their study, the researchers involved were with the Cambridge Health Alliance, which the Boston Herald reported earlier this year, was hemorrhaging money as \"the state's second-largest safety net provider for the poor after Boston Medical Center. Even before the recession hit, the network was facing millions of dollars in state budget cuts, money that largely goes toward treating patients enrolled in the state Medicaid insurance program.\" As such, the system would be one of the principle beneficiaries of the universal-coverage program the report advocates. \n Cambridge Health Alliance cutting workforce, closing clinics - White Coat Notes - Boston.com\n \n They reviewed earlier data of a study from 1988-1994, subsequently updated to 2000, and extrapolated: \n \"We calculated 27,424 deaths among Americans aged 25 to 64 years* in 2000 associated with lack of health insurance. Applying this hazard ratio to census data from 2005 and including all persons aged 18 to 64 years yields an estimated 35,327 deaths annually among the nonelderly associated with lack of health insurance. When we repeated this approach without age stratification, (thought by investigators at the Urban Institute to be an overly conservative approach) we calculated approximately 44,789 deaths among Americans aged 18 to 64 years in 2005 associated with lack of health insurance. \"\n Almost all studies of this type filter out folks 65 and over, who are provided Medicare coverage, and the young, who often receive health insurance through their parents.\n \n \n In other words, when their first results didn't prove scary enough, the researchers tried Plan B. And Plan C.\n \n \n The study is rife with caveats and disclaimers. The authors admitted, \n \"Our study has several limitations... We were unable to measure the effect of gaining or losing coverage after the interview... Earlier population-based surveys that did validate insurance status found that between 7% and 11% of those initially recorded as being uninsured were misclassified. If present, such misclassification might dilute the true effect of uninsurance in our sample.\"\n They cited, \"the increased likelihood of uninsurance among Mexican Americans who were nonetheless no more likely to die than non-Hispanic Whites.\" And they offered the following damning admission:\n \"Unmeasured characteristics (i.e., that individuals who place less value on health eschew both health insurance and healthy behaviors) might offer an alternative explanation for our findings.\"\n Further the results did not differentiate between those who don't have health insurance because they can't afford it and those who can afford insurance but choose not to buy it, often because they are the young 'invincibles,' who aren't concerned about health care -- whether it's a government-run plan or private insurance -- or the wealthy, who, presumably, consider themselves self-insured.\n \n \n The authors said their analysis is based on a previous survey that \"oversampled several groups, including Black persons, (and) Mexican Americans,\" although they claim they were able to use statistical smoke and mirrors to correct for that.\n \n Despite the admitted drawbacks of their work, the authors summarized, \"Lack of health insurance is associated with as many as 44,789 deaths per year.\" (Emphasis added.)\n \n In other words, it's a guesstimate. Might as well close your eyes and throw a dart at the wall.\n \n The figure could be as high as 44,000, it could be 35,000, but their estimate that is most closely tied to the original data -- with the least extrapolation on their part -- is 27,000. And they admit that any or all of their guesses could be off as much as 11% because \"those initially recorded as being uninsured\" may be misclassified.\n \n Let's be clear; any preventable death is a tragedy: the loss of someone's sister or brother, father or mother, spouse or lover.\n \n Yet the study doesn't claim that the deaths it estimates among the uninsured are preventable, only that they are \"associated with\" lack of health care. \n \n By contrast, a comprehensive study of over 35,000,000 -- yes, that's million -- acute care records over a recent three-year period concludes that preventable medical mistakes actually cause a similar number of deaths in the government-run Medicare program. The sixth annual HealthGrades Patient Safety in American Hospital Study examined records \"among Medicare patients at virtually all of the nation's 5,000 non-federal hospitals\" from 2005-2007 and determined that over 92,000 deaths were attributable to medical errors, about the same as the average estimate in the uninsured study. \n \n Further, the report noted that mistakes which could harm a patient are only reported 73% of the time and concluded that their figures \"likely represent a fraction of the number of avoidable patient safety deaths and associated costs.\"\n \n Another recently released study by HealthGrades concludes that \"224,537 Medicare lives could have potentially been saved during 2006 through 2008\" if all hospitals across the country had performed at the quality of care levels of its top-ranked facilities.\n \n Yet why aren't the Democrat demagogues braying about a \"holocaust\" in government-run Medicare, as they did about the inflated uninsured deaths figure? Are they going to admit that it is really their plan, not the Republicans', to let people \"die quickly\"?\n \n And where is the media coverage? Why did they lap up the uninsured deaths Kool-Aid, while ignoring the other two studies?\n \n The Democrats and their Brownshirts in the media have shamelessly, irresponsibly used the hyperbolic 45,000 uninsured deaths estimate like a truncheon, to cow their opponents, even as they ignore the potentially much more deadly consequences of Obamacare.\n American Thinker: 45,000 uninsured deaths?\n ",

   "By: Richard G. Fessler, MD, PhD\n \n The media and political community have made a big deal out of the fact that the U.S. ranks 37 out of 191 countries on the World Health Organization's Health Care Ranking System. Is this tool a credible way to compare quality health care delivered in the U.S. vs the rest of the world? \n \n Let's be perfectly clear about this, the United States Health Care is second to none! Ask the tens of thousands of patients who travel internationally to the US every year for their health care. As an example of the quality of health care delivered in the US, Americans have a higher survival rate than any other country on earth for 13 of 16 of the most common cancers. Perhaps that is why Belinda Stronach, former liberal member of the Canadian Parliament and Cabinet member (one of the health care systems touted as \"superior\" to the US) abandoned the Canadian Health Care system to undergo her cancer treatment in California.1 \n \n But to understand how WHO derives this misleading statistic, which has been ballyhooed widely by both the media and politicians alike, you need to understand how it is created. WHO's health care rankings are constructed from five factors each weighted according to a formula derived by WHO. These are: \n \n 1. Health Level: 25 percent\n \n 2. Health Distribution: 25 percent \n \n 3. Responsiveness: 12.5 percent\n \n 4. Responsiveness Distribution: 12.5 percent\n \n 5. Financial Fairness: 25 percent \n \n \"Health level\" is a measure of a countries \"disability adjusted life expectancy\". This factor makes sense, since it is a direct measure of the health of a country's residents. However, even \"life expectancy\" can be affected by many factors not related to health care per se, such as poverty, homicide rate, dietary habits, accident rate, tobacco use, etc. In fact, if you remove the homicide rate and accidental death rate from MVA's from this statistic, citizens of the US have a longer life expectancy than any other country on earth.2 \n \n \"Responsiveness\" measures a variety of factors such as speed of service, choice of doctors, and amenities (e.g. quality of linens). Some of these make sense to include (speed of service) but some have no direct relationship to health care (quality of linens). These two factors at least make some sense in a ranking of health care, but each is problematic as well. \n \n The other three factors are even worse. \"Financial fairness\" measures the percentage of household income spent on health care. It can be expected that the \"percentage\" of income spent on health care decreases with increasing income, just as is true for food purchases and housing. Thus, this factor does not measure the quality or delivery of health care, but the value judgment that everyone should pay the same \"percentage\" of their income on health care even regardless of their income or use of the system. This factor is biased to make countries that rely on free market incentives look inferior. It rewards countries that spend the same percentage of household income on health care, and punishes those that spend either a higher or lower percentage, regardless of the impact on health. In the extreme then, a country in which all health care is paid for by the government (with money derived from a progressive tax system), but delivers horrible health care, will score perfectly in this ranking, whereas a country where the amount paid for health care is based on use of the system, but delivers excellent health care will rank poorly. To use this factor to justify more government involvement in health care, therefore, is using circular reasoning since this factor is designed to favor government intervention. \n \n \"Health Distribution and Responsiveness Distribution\" measure inequality in the other factors. In other words, neither factor actually measures the quality of health care delivery, because \"inequality of delivery\" is independent of \"quality of care\". It is possible, for example, to have great inequality in a health care system where the majority of the population gets \"excellent\" health care, but a minority only gets \"good\" health care. This system would rank more poorly on these measures than another country that had \"equal\", but poor, health care throughout the system.\n \n In summary, therefore, the WHO ranking system has minimal objectivity in its \"ranking\" of world health. It more accurately can be described as a ranking system inherently biased to reward the uniformity of \"government\" delivered (i.e. \"socialized\") health care, independent of the care actually delivered. In that regard the relatively low ranking of the US in the WHO system can be viewed as a \"positive\" testament to at least some residual \"free market\" influence (also read \"personal freedom\") in the American Health Care system. The American health care consumer needs to understand what the WHO ranking does and does not say about American health. Don't be fooled by \"big government\" politicians and the liberal media who are attempting to use this statistic to push for socialized medicine in the United States. It says essentially nothing about the delivery of health care or the quality of that delivery in the US. It does say that, so far, the American health care consumer has at least some personal freedom to seek the best health care available, and is not yet relegated to the \"one size fits all\" philosophy of government sponsored health care systems. \n \n Susan Delacourt, \"Stronach travels to U.S. for cancer treatment.\" The Star, September 14, 2007. \n Sally C.

   "THE NUMBERS GUY OCTOBER 21, 2009 Ill-Conceived Ranking Makes for Unhealthy Debate In the Wrangle Over Health Care, a Low Rating for the U.S. System Keeps Emerging Despite Evident Shortcomings in Study\n During the health-care debate, one damning statistic keeps popping up in newspaper columns and letters, on cable television and in politicians' statements: The U.S. ranks 37th in the world in health care.\n \n The trouble is, the ranking is dated and flawed, and has contributed to misconceptions about the quality of the U.S. medical system.\n \n Among all the numbers bandied about in the health-care debate, this ranking stands out as particularly misleading. It is based on a report released nearly a decade ago by the World Health Organization and relies on statistics that are even older and incomplete.\n \n Few people who cite the ranking are aware that some public-health officials were skeptical of the report from the outset. The ranking was faulted because it judges health-care systems for problems -- cultural, behavioral, economic -- that aren't controlled by health care.\n \n \"It's a very notorious ranking,\" says Mark Pearson, head of health for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the 30-member, Paris-based organization of the world's largest economies. \"Health analysts don't like to talk about it in polite company. It's one of those things that we wish would go away.\"\n \n More recent efforts to rank national health systems have been inconclusive. On measures such as child mortality and life expectancy, the U.S. has slipped since the 2000 rankings. But some researchers say that factors beyond the control of the health-care system are to blame, such as dietary habits. Studies that have attempted to exclude these factors from the equation don't agree on whether the U.S. system looks better or worse.\n \n The WHO ranking was ambitious in its scope, grading each nation's health care on five factors. Two of these were relatively uncontroversial: health level, which is roughly the average healthy lifespan of a nation's residents; and responsiveness, which is a sort of customer-service rating encompassing factors such as the system's speed, choice and quality of amenities. The other three measure inequality in health-care outcomes; responsiveness; and individual spending.\n \n These last three measures struck some analysts as problematic, because a country with unhealthy people could rank above a healthier one where there was a bigger gap between healthy and unhealthy people. It is certainly possible that spreading health care as evenly as possible makes a society healthier, but the rankings struck some health-care researchers as assuming that, rather than demonstrating it.\n \n An even bigger problem was shared by all five of these factors: The underlying data about each nation generally weren't available. So WHO researchers calculated the relationship between those factors and other, available numbers, such as literacy rates and income inequality. Such measures, they argued, were linked closely to health in those countries where fuller health data were available. Even though there was no way to be sure that link held in other countries, they used these literacy and income data to estimate health performance.\n \n Philip Musgrove, the editor-in-chief of the WHO report that accompanied the rankings, calls the figures that resulted from this step \"so many made-up numbers,\" and the result a \"nonsense ranking.\" Dr. Musgrove, an economist who is now deputy editor of the journal Health Affairs, says he was hired to edit the report's text but didn't fully understand the methodology until after the report was released. After he left the WHO, he wrote an article in 2003 for the medical journal Lancet criticizing the rankings as \"meaningless.\"\n \n The objects of his criticism, including Christopher Murray, who oversaw the ranking for the WHO, responded in a letter to the Lancet arguing that WHO \"has an obligation to provide the best available evidence in a timely manner to Member States and the scientific community.\" It also credited the report with achieving its \"original intent\" of stimulating debate and focus on health systems.\n \n Prof. Murray, now director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, Seattle, says that \"the biggest problem was just data\" -- or the lack thereof, in many cases. He says the rankings are now \"very old,\" and acknowledges they contained a lot of uncertainty. His institute is seeking to produce its own rankings in the next three years. The data limitations hampering earlier work \"are why groups like ours are so focused on trying to get rankings better.\"\n \n A WHO spokesman says the organization has no plans to update the rankings, and adds, \"We would not consider it current.\"\n \n And yet many people apparently do. The 37th place ranking is often cited in today's overhaul debate, even though, in some ways, the U.S. actually ranked a lot higher. Specifically, it placed 15th overall, based on its performance in the five criteria. But for the most widely publicized form of its rankings, the WHO took the additional step of adjusting for national health expenditures per capita, to calculate each country's health-care bang for its bucks. Because the U.S. ranked first in spending, that adjustment pushed its ranking down to 37th. Dominica, Costa Rica and Morocco ranked 42nd, 45th and 94th before adjusting for spending levels, compared to the U.S.'s No. 15 ranking. After adjustment, all three countries ranked higher than the U.S.\n \n Still, people often claim that the 37th-place ranking refers to quality or outcomes. High spending rates pushed the ranking down but didn't degrade the quality of care. Among those who have recently failed to make that distinction in published comments are Colorado Rep. Diana DeGette; Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin; and Margaret E. O'Kane, president of the National Committee for Quality Assurance, an advocacy group.\n \n Representatives for Ms. DeGette and Mr. Harkin didn't respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the National Committee for Quality Assurance said, \"WHO is a respected organization. ...We have no reason to believe it is inaccurate, and we would never knowingly misrepresent or misuse another organization's data.\"\n \n The flawed WHO report shouldn't obscure that the U.S. is lagging its peers in some major barometers of public health. For instance, the U.S. slipped from 18th to 24th in male life expectancy from 2000 to 2009, according to the United Nations, and from 28th to 35th in female life expectancy. Its rankings in preventing male and female under-5 mortality also fell, and placed in the 30s.\n \n But even such analyses, more limited in scope than the WHO's effort, face similar problems: How to differentiate between the quality of the medical system and other factors, such as diet, exercise and violent-crime rates.\n \n Some think that if the U.S. health-care system isn't responsible for troubling outcomes, trying to fix it doesn't provide the best return on investment.\n \n \"We might get more bang for the buck by setting aside some of our health-care money to support novel approaches to improve nutrition, education, exercise or public safety,\" says Alan Garber, an economist and professor of medicine at Stanford University. \"Not every health problem has a medical solution.\"\n \n Nor can everything be ranked -- especially health-care systems. \"I think it's a fool's errand,\" says Dr. Musgrove.\n \n An Ill-Conceived Health-Care Ranking - WSJ.com",

   "Health Insurance Coverage and Mortality Revisited\n Richard Kronick\n \n Objective. To improve understanding of the relationship between lack of insurance and risk of subsequent mortality.\n \n Data Sources. Adults who reported being uninsured or privately insured in the National Health Interview Survey from 1986 to 2000 were followed prospectively for mortality from initial interview through 2002. Baseline information was obtained on 672,526 respondents, age 18-64 at the time of the interview. Follow-up information on vital status was obtained for 643,001 (96 percent) of these respondents, with approximately 5.4 million person-years of follow-up.\n \n Study Design. Relationships between insurance status and subsequent mortality are examined using Cox proportional hazard survival analysis.\n \n Principal Findings. Adjusted for demographic, health status, and health behavior characteristics, the risk of subsequent mortality is no different for uninsured respondents than for those covered by employer-sponsored group insurance at baseline (hazard ratio 1.03, 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.95-1.12). Omitting health status as a control variable increases the estimated hazard ratio to 1.10 (95 percent CI, 1.03-1.19). Also omitting smoking status and body mass index increases the hazard ratio to 1.20 (95 percent CI, 1.15-1.24). The estimated association between lack of insurance and mortality is not larger among disadvantaged subgroups; when the analysis is restricted to amenable causes of death; when the follow-up period is shortened (to increase the likelihood of comparing the continuously insured and continuously uninsured); and does not change after people turn 65 and gain Medicare coverage.\n \n Conclusions. The Institute of Medicine's estimate that lack of insurance leads to 18,000 excess deaths each year is almost certainly incorrect. It is not possible to draw firm causal inferences from the results of observational analyses, but there is little evidence to suggest that extending insurance coverage to all adults would have a large effect on the number of deaths in the United States.\n \n HSR Abstract\n rawk peer reviewed rawk",

   "Truth is not only the first casualty of war, it is also the first casualty of serious public policy debate.\n \n \"An estimated 17,000 children in the United States might have died unnecessarily over nearly two decades because they didn't have health insurance,\" said U.S. News and World Report. \"The authors estimated that at least 1,000 hospitalized children died each year simply because they lacked insurance,\" said The New York Times.\n \n They're talking about a Johns Hopkins Children's Center study [gated, but with abstract]. But between the media hype and the actual study is an enormous chasm that separates fact from fiction. In truth, the authors of the study did not establish that anybody, anywhere, died of any cause whatsoever because of a lack of health insurance.\n \n This is only the latest in a series of ridiculous claims that have been injected into the health insurance debate. What follows is a brief review, some of which has appeared earlier at the Health Affairs blog.\n \n Last year, a report by Families USA made the astounding claim that 6 people die every day in Florida because they are uninsured. Seven die every day in Texas, 8 in California, and 25 in New York.\n \n How was Families USA able to tally up all that carnage with such pinpoint precision? As one of us previously explained, these claims are based on a 15-year cascade of studies - each repeating the errors and misinterpreting or mischaracterizing the findings of the previous one and ultimately relying on data that is 37 years old.\n \n It begins with a paper by Peter Franks et al. published in Journal of the American Medical Association in 1993, estimating that being uninsured increased the probability of death by 25%. Although the subjects were interviewed only once, for the study's inference to be meaningful, one is forced to make the unverified assumption that the uninsured stayed uninsured for a full 19 years!\n \n Continuing the saga, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) uncritically used the Frank's result to claim that 18,000 deaths a year in the U.S. are attributable to a lack of health insurance. The Urban Institute updated the IOM report, and Families USA updated that report.\n \n Not to be outdone, the Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP) repeated the exercise (with all its methodological sins) and boosted the tally to a 40% increase in the probability of dying for the uninsured. That produces a whopping 45,000 premature deaths every year - almost as bad as the Vietnam War. And, yes, we get a state-by-state breakdown. There will be 5,302 deaths attributed to uninsurance in California this year. There will be 75 in Wyoming, etc., etc. There is even a minute-by-minute tally: \"The Institute of Medicine, using older studies, estimated that one American dies every 30 minutes from lack of health insurance,\" says David Himmelstein, one of the authors. \"Now one dies every 12 minutes.\"\n \n As in the previous incarnations, the researchers interviewed the uninsured only once - and never saw them again. A decade later, the researchers assumed the participants were still uninsured and, if they died in the interim, lack of insurance is blamed as one of the causes.\n \n Yet, like unemployment, uninsurance happens to many people for short periods of time. Most people who are uninsured regain insurance within one year. The authors of the study did not track what happened to the insurance status of the subjects over the decade examined, what medical care they received or even the causes of their deaths.\n \n Also, before you go into mourning too quickly, be aware that when former Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) June O'Neill and her husband Dave used a similar approach they found that the involuntarily uninsured (low-income people) were only 3% more likely to die over a 14-year period than those with health insurance. There was no statistically significant effect on the \"voluntarily uninsured\" (higher-income people).\n \n That's not too surprising in light of a RAND study finding. People are receiving appropriate care a little better than half the time when they see doctors. According to RAND, the care patients receive is not affected by whether they are insured or uninsured or by the type of insurance they have. People who are uninsured, of course, may delay seeing a doctor in the first place - because of their lack of insurance. But this problem is unlikely to be solved by enrolling them in Medicaid programs that routinely ration by waiting.\n \n The uninsured in the PNHP study are disproportionally poor, minority, high school dropouts and unemployed. Although the study ignores public insurance, bills before Congress would try to insure this group by expanding Medicaid. The O'Neills found that people enrolled in Medicaid have a much higher mortality rate than the uninsured. In other words, Medicaid enrollment reduces life expectancy rather than increasing it!\n \n The Johns Hopkins study at least has one advantage over all the other studies: The authors knew the insurance status of the children at the time they died. After combing hospital records over a 20-year period, they determined that although children admitted to hospitals rarely die, those who did were 60% more likely to have been uninsured. But does that mean that uninsurance is the reason? The authors offer no theory connecting uninsurance with health and no specific theory is tested.\n \n Of children admitted to hospitals who did not die, the average length of stay (two days) is the same for the insured and the uninsured. The cost of care is about 90% the same. This is consistent with the RAND results. However, among children who died, the length of stay for insured children is longer and more varied, and the cost of care is 21/2 times higher than for the uninsured. In fact, more than half of the uninsured children who died did not remain in the hospital for even a single day - which suggests that many died in the emergency room or were DOA. It seems likely, therefore, that among those who died, the insured and uninsured were very dissimilar.\n \n The most common reasons for children being hospitalized were complications from birth, pneumonia, and asthma. The study found that the reasons did not differ by insurance status.\n \n What did differ was the fraction of deaths in the older uninsured population, particularly those aged 11-18. This matters because there is an extensive literature chronicling the fact that child accident and homicide rates, which have the largest effects on teenagers, are inversely related to parental characteristics like income, and educational attainment, directly related to parental levels of substance abuse, and a function of marital status and living arrangements.\n \n In the early 2000s, motor vehicle accidents, drowning, burns, and poisoning, cause more than a third of all deaths among children aged 1-19. Homicide was the 4th leading cause of death in 1-4 year olds, 5-9 year olds, and 10-14 year olds. It was the 2nd leading cause of death in 15-19 year olds. [link, link] Lack of insurance is unlikely to contribute to deaths by homicide, motor vehicle crash, drowning, burns, or poisoning.\n \n Remarkably, this paper is silent on whether people living in conditions that make their children more prone to accidental death or homicide are also less likely to have health insurance.\n \n Richard Kronick has a review of the literature on what we know about those who lack health insurance in the August issue of Health Services Research. He writes:\n \n There would not be much change in the number of deaths in the United States as a result of universal coverage, although the difficulties in inferring causality from observational analyses temper the strength of this conclusion.\n \n As for the public policy implications of all this, the PNHP authors are on record as favoring Canada's system of single-payer national health insurance. Yet insured patients in Canada fare worse than the uninsured in the United States. The O'Neills find that:\n \n Among US women age 40 to 64, 87% of those with insurance had a mammogram within 5 years. \n The rate for Canadian women is 65% - the same as for uninsured women in the US. \n Canadian women also have the same rate of screening for cervical cancer as uninsured US women (80%), over five years. Among insured US women, the rate is 92%. \n Among uninsured US men, 31% were screened for prostate cancer, compared with 16% of Canadian men. For insured US men, the rate is 52%. \n http://www.john-goodman-blog.com/does-lack-of-insurance-cause-premature-death-probably-not/",

Eduardo was first hospitalized at Children&#8217;s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, MO in July 2009 and was there for three months before being sent home on Oct. 14, 2009. Since Eduardo doesn&#8217;t have health insurance and his undocumented residency status prevents him from being eligible for Medicaid in Kansas City, the family was told they need $500,000.00 to place Eduardo on the transplant waiting list for a heart. Children&#8217;s Mercy Hospital does not perform heart transplants. The hospital is doing everything they can to get Eduardo on the list, but they have not had any success. Doctors say he could die in a few days or a few years, but without getting on the waiting list for the heart, he doesn&#8217;t have a chance.\n \n Eduardo now needs our help to get the heart he desperately needs.\n \n Healthcare-NOW! and the Poor People&#8217;s Economic and Human Rights Campaign call on healthcare advocates and people of conscience to join the campaign to save his life. Together, we must demand that Eduardo get on the wait list for a heart.\n \n There are millions like Eduardo who are unable to access the health care they need because of financial barriers to care. This injustice must end. We ask that you to continue support and build for a solution that is universal, humane, and equitable &#8211; improved Medicare for All.\n \n Here is what you can do right now to give Eduardo a heart for the holidays and build the movement for Medicare for All:\n \n 1. Sign and circulate the international appeal to save his life (download a printable petition here).\n \n 2. Join us for the fundraiser on December 20th in Kansas. If you can&#8217;t be there, sponsor someone else to come!\n \n Date: Sunday, December 20, 2009&#8232;Time: 5:00pm &#8211; 9:00pm&#8232;Location: JCCC Capitol Federal Room (Regnier Center), 12345 College Blvd, Overland Park, Kansas 66210\n \n 3. Donate to the campaign to give Eduardo a heart. Either go here to donate online, or donations can be sent to the Gahutier Eduardo Loredo Transplant Fund at any Bank of America branch.\n \n 4. Tell everyone &#8211; Forward this information!\n \n 5. Plan an action on December 21st for Eduardo and Medicare for all. We are asking people to plan vigils, meetings, gather petition signatures, or fund raise to make sure that the message about Eduardo is reaching the public. Use this time to educate the public about Eduardo&#8217;s case and the need for Medicare for all. Please pledge to plan an action to demand that Eduardo receive a heart, and end deaths because of inability to pay for healthcare. Fill out this form if you are going to plan action..\n \n 6. Write a letter to the editor about Eduardo&#8217;s that says we wouldn&#8217;t have to fight for Eduardo&#8217;s life, or for the 45,000 others who die every year for lack of access to healthcare, if we had Medicare for everyone.\n \n 7. Find Eduardo on Facebook.\n \n With your help, we will stand up for the right to health care by loudly demanding that Eduardo be placed on the waiting list for the heart he so desperately needs. As we fight for a 14-year-old to have access to his full life&#8217;s potential and the health care this country needs, we remember Dr. King&#8217;s powerful words, &#8220;Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.&#8221; muchmore@http://www.healthcare-now.org/eduardo/\n\n \n \n Since all of you righties are so into charity as a solution, and have no agenda-ax to grind, (in your lust for unregulated health insurance companies with no government options except for people like Dick Armey), let's see you dig deeply into your purses at this sentimental time of year that touches you so, and give generously so that Eduardo's family can raise the 1/2 million dollars he needs to be on a list.\n \n This is a preventable death.
