   "Creationists on this forum have taken to arguing against the biggest straw man that has ever been erected to mischaracterize evolution. So, instead of wasting my time responding to each of their posts, I will point out the problems with this pseudoscientific social theory. First of all, let's look at the social context of Darwin's time.\n \n It was the mid 1800s. The industrial revolution was well underway. England was a major colonial power. Capitalism was largely unfettered and everyone had to fend for themselves. The racism & the extreme individualism that is often atrributed to \"Darwinism\" was actually a condition of the society. If anything, those conditions may have influenced Darwin's view of natural selection. He did not influence society - it influenced him. Herbert Spencer just took from Darwin what appealed to him in order to justify his own austere view of society.\n \n Second of all, fascists and communists adopted some of the same jargon in order to argue for political & economic systems that were diametrically opposed to Spencer's Laissez faire capitalism. So how could this be? How could natural selection apply equally well to the individualistic ethic of capitalism and the collectivism of communism? The answer is quite simple; people will use whatever jargon they find handy in order to justify what they do. And this brings up the major flaw in applying natural selection to social systems. \n \n They replace the natural environment with an arbitrarily artificial social one. Darwin's theory was never meant to apply to anything but nature itself. But, since there are any number of possible social systems, someone can make an argument that the ability to meet the expectations of any particular system involves \"survival of the fittest\" (Spencer's phrase, BTW - not Darwin's). So the \"fittest\" can be those who make good business men, or good little nazis, or good communist party members, or good welfare bums. The meaning of the term, \"fittest\", is as arbitrary as the social systems one is trying to fit into. But how does this relate to the real environment?\n \n Darwin did have a bias in his view of nature, which probably had to do with the society he lived in. He emphasized competition between individuals (usually male) of the same species for access to food or sex. He wasn't totally wrong in his view. He was just limited. He didn't consider the importance of cooperative alliances between individuals, symbiotic relationships between different species in an ecosystem, or how the cooperation & integration of the cells making up an individual enhance that individuals ability to survive. Natural selection is understood today in a much broader context than what these \"social darwinists\" envisioned. We have concepts like coevolution, Lynn Margulis' endosymbiotic theory of cell evolution, and systems biology, which consider more than just this \"dog-eat-dog\" caricature of survival in nature. But creationists still insist on misrepresenting natural selection as an excuse to engage in purely selfish behavior. Go figure.\n \n Then there is the notion that \"Darwinism\" leads to elitism and racism. The poorly thought out rationale for this caricature is the misapplication of selection to social classes. But only the traits of individuals are passed on from one generation to the next. This actually serves as a leveling influence in society, rather than a means to separate people into social classes. Remember, natural selection reduces the amount of variation in a population; it doesn't increase the differences between individuals. If anything, those in the lower classes will become more fit because of the harsh conditions that they must endure, and the upper classes will have more mentally & physically unfit individuals who will then pass those traits on to the next generation. Strictly speaking, this selection process should make it easier for those at the bottom to even the score, so to speak. What really happens in society to maintain the status quo is the political and economical power of the priviledged classes - not the process of natural selection. Social darwinists are really using the language of evolution to hide that fact and to give themselves a facade of credibility. Don't be fooled.\n \n Finally, I want to point out that the current evidence points to a rather recent diaspora of modern humans around the globe. Modern people spread from Africa only about 50,000 years ago, and there has been much interbreeding between populations. So we all share a recent gene pool which has not had any isolated pockets that could have bred any appreciable amount of difference between us. There are no pure bred races. There are no isolated gene pools. Evolutionary theory confirms this. Evolution is perfectly in sync with the values of equality and human cooperation. Don't be fooled by creationist rhetoric to the contrary",

   "**\n I think that the topic is an interesting one, and should lead to some good debates. However, I'm not sure if prschuster is \"fer it or agin it\".\n \n Basically 'social Darwinism' is, in my view, just another modern rendition of a self-serving rationalization promoted by the 'haves' ever since civilization first divided societies into 'haves' and 'have nots'. That is, that the few who have all the wealth and power deserve it because they earned it, and that they earned it because they were/are superior in talents and effort and virtue to those who had/have little or nothing.\n \n This goes all the way back to before the bible and the notion that some have and deserve what was \"given to them by God\", while others suffer thanks to God or 'the gods'' approbation. Often \"God\" is just another way of saying, Fate, Fortune, or Luck, i.e., the same cause but without any religious/moral justification.\n \n The notion of inherited inequality can be traced back for millenia in the notion, 'as above, so below'--the idea that that what humans have on earth is a reflection of what their souls acquired in heaven. The pre-destination of Calvinism dates back thousands of years, predating Christianity itself, and it simply says that the rich and powerful are rich and powerful because they are an 'elect', an 'elite', who earned their reward by their 'loyalty to God' in the heavenly civil wars, while the sick, downtrodden and degraded on this earth are the unfortunate, 'predestined damned', before this life and in the next.\n \n It is out of this Calvinism, the Blending Inheritance notion, and other roots of social elitism, that Darwin's \"Natural Selection\" appeared , whole cloth. Except that, instead of God doing the selecting on 'moral' grounds, Mother Nature was doing it on 'physical' grounds. That is, biological grounds, that is, according to a 'natural' superiority/inferiority in biological inheritance. As opposed to the old semi-divine 'right' of kings and aristocracies in general.\n \n It didn't take the blink of an eye to bat the darwinian ball right back into the social court that served it. Hence, social Darwinism. Seen today in the regressive conservative ethos of right-wing regimes everywhere, including North America. Today its most vocal political boosters form the \"Libertarian\" party and other fans of the Ayn Rand adolescent self-superior view. \n \n I, of, course, despise it, in both its religious right-wing, and its secular right-wing (corporatist/libertarian) forms, and in that partnership of both that is the Republican Bush administration as well as other crypto-fascist regimes.\n \n Here, from answers.com, is a working definition of this rationalization for social inequality--\n \n \"social Darwinism\n n.\n The application of Darwinism to the study of human society, specifically a theory in sociology that individuals or groups achieve advantage over others as the result of genetic or biological superiority.\"\n \n That is, INHERITED superiority, with the necessary corallory, inherited inferiority. Hence justification for everything from eugenics to ethnic cleansing, no different from when, in legend, Joshua slaughtered the Canaanites on God's say so, and the Zionists repeat the crime today.\n \n Ask yourselves. What practical difference is there between blaming the victim of social injustice on God's will, (the enslaved negro and the 'curse of Ham', or, 'lack of family values'), and blaming black poverty etc. on genetics? (See P. Rushton, \"The Bell Curve\", and \"Evolutionary Psychology\", \"The Pioneer Institute\".) It's all just blaming the victim in order to justify rapaciousness and collective greed and injustice, always has been, and still is today.",

Hitler experienced this first hand when his star olympic runner of the Aryan race lost to a black man. Social selection is pure generalizing and extrapolation, such as \"Britons are superior to Italian immigrants because most of the Italian immigrants have low paying jobs in factories, while most of the British own factories.\" There exists a correlation, but no actual evidence for the claim that superiority is a function of social status. It's possible that the Italian immigrants could actually make very fine factory owners if they were put in the position of the British.\n \n Natural selection requires no pseudo-scientific extrapolation whatsoever. There cannot be any other reason for a specie's extinction than its failure to change. If a meteor hit the earth and destroyed all life, the reason life went extinct would be because life didn't change in time to become resistant to the effects of the meteor's impact.\n \n Social selection took a nose dive when the monarchies of Europe experienced revolutions.

Moreover \"Blending\" inheritance, notion upon which Darwin based his entire 'theory', had been used for centuries to justify the social distinctions between the 'nobles' and the 'commons', the 'thoroughbreds' and the 'mongrels', the 'purebreds' and the 'mixed breeds/races'. How can you even attempt to deny it?!?\n \n \n\n Natural selection acts upon the individuals who carry the genes for traits. The genes are the units that are eventually selected. It is evolution that happens in populations as a result of the action of natural selection upon individuals in those populations affecting the differential rates of reproductive success which result in a change in gene frequencies in ithe gene pool of the population. Sorry for being so wordy, but you are confusing the mechanism of natural selection with the process of evolution. Natural selection works on individuals; evolution happens in populations. Do you understand the distinctions that I am making?\n\n \n **\n I understand that according to according to modern Darwinists, evolution is no more than the statistical fluctuations of certain alleles relative to others in a given population, and that the mechanism supposed responsible for these statistical fluctuations is called, \"Natural Selection\". It seems irrational to me to attribute the mechanism that operates on one unit, a single organism, in order to account for the evolution of something else, a 'population'. The one deals with concrete traits, the other deals with abstract numbers, and so are categorically different.\n \n For one thing, the very word, 'selection' entails 'choice', and their can be no 'choice' given a single individual organism. Therefore, for 'selection' to operate, it must always operate upon a 'population' of at least two individuals.\n Your claim that \"NS\" operates on individuals rather than populations is manifestly false. Selection can only work on populations. Anything else is impossible.\n \n \n\n Social classes would evolve independantly of one another if they were genetically isolated populations, that remained separate for thousands of years. But they don't represent separate gene pools in this sense. Even racial groups are never \"pure bred\". Just look at all the areas in the world where there are blends of many different racial stocks. The middle east is the prime example of this, where three continents meet and there is an unbelievable mix of people.\n\n \n \n **\n I said nothing about empirical reality. I referred to the false theory, notion, abstract hypothesis, belief system, what you will, out of which Darwin derived his \"NS\", an abstract notion that others adopted as scientific 'justification' for their ancient elitist beliefs. Reality always shows up \"NS\" for the meaningless, and nasty, elitist theoretic that it is.\n \n \n\n Theoretically, natural selection could have led to real differences between groups of people, but the evidence does not point in that direction, so any use of darwinian language to imply as much is pure pseudoscience.\n\n \n **\n What you are saying is that since reality doesn't do what Darwinian theory says it should, then Darwinian theory couldn't have said what it very clearly does say. \n \n \n\n But Lamarckian evolution requires that these aquired traits be passed on to future generations, which has yet to be proven. What we do have, though, is social evolution where good habits can be passed on culturally to future generations. That's what we have to work with.\n\n \n **\n Actually, the original Lamarckism required nothing for evolution except that a change in traits was experienced by an organism during its own lifetime. Whether or not it lived to reproduce was not really a consideration, although it was assumed that if it did reproduce, those 'acquired traits' would be automatically passed on to its offspring. We are talking 200 years ago, and Lamarck was mostly simply restating a POV on biological change that had been around for centuries, and not a viewpoint on biological trait conservation over time (i.e., inheritance), as Darwin was to do later on, ultimately ending with the geneticist view of evolution (defined earlier), that is, as selected inherited advantage/disadvantage, that dominates evolutionary theory today.\n \n Today's Lamarckian theory is generational, in that it depends upon both physical responses in a parent and physiological responses to those responses in the embryonic and developing offspring. It's still called, \"evolutionary development\", although it should be called, \"developmental evolution\". I call it \"Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis\", \"EAM\" for short. By this measure any change in trait epigenetically inherited by an offspring from a parent is evolutionary, even if there is no genetic/allelic change involved. It speaks to the evolution of whole, real, organisms; not the evolution (i.e., statistical fluctuations) of abstract 'genotypes', as modern Darwinism does.\n \n And BTW, both developmental evolution and epigenetic inheritance are proven facts, not empty theorizing.\n \n \n\n Just a minute... the misapplication of darwinian principles to society is pseudoscientific - not natural selection itself.\n\n \n **\n Says you. I say the misapplication (by Darwin) of 19th century socio-economic theory and stock-breeder folk-wisdom to evolutionary biology was what was, and still remains, pseudo-science. Erroneous theory-<pseudo- biology-<trash socio-economics/politics.\n \n \n\n Besides, I'm confused by your use of the term \"inheritance\". You're using it in a strictly social sense here. Are you implying that this is supposed to lead to genetic inheritance? \n\n \n **\n I don't know what confuses you. I'm stating that the social beliefs that came with the erroneous theory of inheritance, \"Blending Inheritance Theory\", were what Darwin based his own \"Natural Selection\" theory upon. That is 'folk-wisdom' not replaced by a valid theory of inheritance until the R.C. monk, Gregor Mendel, overthrew it with scienceand empirical observation. The genetic (Mendelian) theory of inheritance, constantly updated, has brought much good to us in the 20th century, and will no doubt continue to benefit mankind, but had nothing whatsoever to do with Darwin and his notions. The shotgun wedding of Mendelian theory of inheritance to the selectionist evolutionary theory of Darwin in the 1930-40's, as RMNS, is what is generally referred to as \"modern Darwinism\". It never stood up to empirical scrutiny and testing via the scientific method, but it is still around. That's what I would call, 'pseudo-science'.\n \n \n\n You're only making a case that darwinian evolution is being misunderstood - not that it has an actual connection to these social conditions. Your ad hoc assertions are getting old.\n\n \n **\n Actually, the observations of these old notions in today's world can, as I said, be traced back to pre-biblical times, and in that sense, yes, they are very old. That you refuse to see the roots of Darwinism in the elitist socio-economic theories that preceded it by centuries, and latterly, decades, seems to me to bespeak a certain mulish stubbornness.\n \n \n\n There you go again repeating your assertion that natural selection is based on these social assumptions.\n\n \n **\n Well, duh, yeah! Because those old social assumptions are the very ones that upper-crust British country-squire Charles Darwin based his theory upon, whether you like it or not!! \"God is an Englishman, eh, wot?!\", and all that XXXX.\n \n \n\n Besides, you are mixing the Spencerian language of \"suvival of the fittest\" with the natural selection of traits which are passed on to future generations. \n\n \n **\n And the distinction between those two ways of saying exactly the same thing would be...?!?\n \n \n\n There is nothing in \"Origin of Species\" that implies that some individuals deserve to survive.\n\n \n **\n Of course there is.\n \n \n\n It's just a fact that, in nature, some traits are more likely to be passed on to future generations. \n\n \n \n **\n Now there's a vacuous truism. But until you can demonstrate a universal criterion by which predictions can be made as to which traits will, and which will not be passed along, you haven't said a thing in any scientific sense.\n \n \n\n Anyway, it's just a statistical thing, since there are a lot of contingencies in nature that have nothing to do with this selection process. \n\n \n **\n Which reduces 'selection' theory to a triviality.\n \n \n\n Since when does natural selection discount the fact that some individuals make better use of their inherited potentials than others, through their own internally driven effort? \n\n \n **\n Always and everywhere. Darwinan selection is totally dependent upon a mechanical POV whis say that accidentally generated gene alterations determine traits which a metaphorical \"Natural Selector\" works on so that adaptation is only coincidental to organismic need. The organism is seen as just one more passive 'bit of stuff' at the mercy of whatever comes its way, with no dynamic control over its own survival or reproductive success--its genes get all the glory and all the blame in the materialist/mechanist genetic theory of evolution. The organism itself (see Dawkins) is nothing more than a passive vehicle, a donkey, on which mutated genes slouch toward Bethlehem to be born. (Apologies to T.S. Elliot)\n \n \n\n Also, I've already stated that social classes are not isolated populations that represent aeparate gene pools. \n\n \n **\n Reality, as I've already pointed out, is not the issue. It's social beliefs and Darwinian theory's entanglement in those beliefs that we are discussing here, not empirically observed facts.\n \n \n\n Natural selection works on individuals and results in a change in gene frequencies in isolated populations.\n\n \n **\n I've already demonstrated the logical fallacy in that assertion, above. \"Selection\", by its very nature, can only operate on 'populations' of two or more, never on individuals, because a single option is never a choice.\n \n \n\n Social selection works on specific groups of people and has little to do with the inheritance of genetic traits from one generation to the next.\n\n \n **\n Again, the reality is not at issue, the theory is what is at issue. The theory states that 'selection' OF ANY KIND, _artificial_ as well as natural, is what determines which \"genetic traits [are preponderantly inherited in any 'population'] from one generation to the next\". That's what 'breeding' is all about. That's why almost all of Europe's nobility pre-WWI were related to ol' Queen Vic. And that's Darwinian \"NS\" theory in its essence.\n \n \n\n In other words, social selection has more to do with what social group you belong to and which priviledges you enjoy with little emphasis upon what you inherit biologically. This is a real \"apples / oranges\" comparison from the get go.\n\n \n \n **\n I hope that after this post you will catch on to the difference between empirical reality and theory/belief systems, as well as their their influences upon one another.\n \n \n\n Please explain to me what Lamarckian theory says about the inheritance of traits. I was under the impression that Lamarck talked about the inheritance of aquired characteristcs. I know that Darwin accepted Lamarck's view of inheritance, but he place his emphasis on the environment as a selecting agent. \n\n \n **\n Lamarck's theory was about evolution, not inheritance. To my knowledge Lamarck had no fixed opinion on the nature of inheritance mechanisms, only on evolutionary ones. His basic theory was that it was the demands and exigencies of the environment that stimulated organisms to respond by evolving adaptively. Inheritance just \"came naturally\", i.e., automatically, as best I recall.\n \n Darwin, OTH, derived his \"theory\" out of the ancient and erroneous inheritance theory called \"Blending\". Look it up. He theorized, as a stock breeder, that all variations are present 'a priori', and that evolution was simply a matter of selective inheritance; that is, subtracting the unwanted traits from the desired ones. The 'selection' part in his 'theory' is not the intelligent choice based upon criteria that makes up artificial selection, aka, breeding, but simply the environment sometimes works out favourably wrt to some inherited variations, sometimes unfavourably wrt others, with no fixed criterion at all. Darwin's theory of evolution was really a theory of inherited traits and their distribution/dispersal, not evolution, (that is, the origin of novel traits), despite the misleading title of his book.\n \n When contemporaries pointed this out to Darwin, he re-wrote Lamarck, (without credit due, as was his habit), and called it \"pangenesis\".\n \n \n\n prs = walking-fish. I don't have a multiple personality disorder, so I don't mind.\n\n \n **\n Sorry. First time I've ever encountered a poster who posted under two different names at the very same time.\n \n \n\n But. nevertheless, the validity of either view rests upon the evidence. Why aren't you talking about the evidence for lamarckism instead of trying to connect Spencer's social theory to Darwin?\n\n \n **\n Because you brought up the issue of \"social Darwinism\" in this thread, for heaven's sake!! If you want to discuss the issue of modern Lamarckian theory, there is already an active thread for that purpose entitled, \"Let's get Lamarckism Straight\".",

Evolution only happens in a population as a result of this selection happening among the individual members of the group, causing the genetic make up of the gene pool to change. How many times do I have to reiterate that natural selection works on individuals, causing the population to evolve? None of this has much relevance to the social darwinist myth that the higher social classes exist because of the survival of more \"fit\" individuals, anyway.\n \n Secondly, the issue of conscious choice is way off base. Selection, in the darwinian sense, is nothing more than differential reproduction rates based on the ability to adapt to the environment. There are a lot of examples of non-conscious selection.

Instead of the normal (idiotic) \"Darwinism promotes eugenics, genocide, etc., so Darwinism must not be true\" approach, wabbit appears to be trying to discredit Darwinism by claiming that it arose from a bunk concept (and also, seemingly, because wabbit thinks it is \"nasty\"). This is no grounds for rejecting Darwinism, even were it true.

Some things do not. Do small rocks \"choose\" to fit through the screen? Do small bugs \"choose\" to fit through a window screen, or do they simply fit through it regardless of choice? You might argue that engineers chose the screen size to let small rocks through, and that builders chose the window screen size to keep large bugs out, but let's apply the concept to a non-artificial example: Do certain organisms \"choose\" to freeze to death?

Of course not.\n \n \nTherefore, for 'selection' to operate, it must always operate upon a 'population' of at least two individuals.\n\n You clearly care about semantics more than you care about concepts.

   "Quote by walking-fish:\n Many times it's the ability to cooperate with another individual that is selected for - not just self serving behavior. Inclusive fitness, coevolution and symbiotic relationships are all selected for if these arrangements enhance the mutual survival of the individuals involved. \n \n \n \n wascallywabbit:\n That's the point. Everything and anything can be, in your peculiar lingo, \"selected for\", today, \"selected against\", tomorrow, and ignored the day after that. Anything that nebulous and relative forms no part of science in particular, nor rational thought in general. It's pure, unadulterated, hokum.\n Science works with universals, not this XXXX.\n \n \n \n walking-fish:\n In other words, you object to the fact that natural selection is such a broad theory that it can account for all observable evolutionary adaptations. Isn't that what all good theories in science do? Your objection makes about as much sense as saying Newton's laws of motion & his law of gravity are too nebulous because they account for all motions in the heavens (including both centrifugal & centripetal force). Of course the environment changes so it selects for something one day and against it the next, just like different forces in nature make something go in one direction one day and another direction the next. \n \n But... natural selection (NS) does not explein all evolutionary changes, so it is not relative. It does not explain nonadaptive change. We have genetic drift, gene flow and neutral selection as well as NS. We know that NS doesn't select for the ability to withstand freezing temperatures in tropical animals, or claws to rip flesh in herbivores. There are a lot of things that NS does not select for and we can even predict, with a good deal of accuracy, what we will not find in an organism once we know about it's habits & habitat. Nor will find structures appearing with no prior evolutionary history. For example, I predict that we will never find a four legged bird in the fossil record, because, even though such an animal would be better adapted to it's environment than two legged birds, we know that developmental restraints require NS to work on what is already available, and an extra pair of limbs does not appear fully formed in vertebrate embryogenesis without limb girdles to support them, and without a long history of prior usage of these limbs that have preadapted them for use as wings. This is how NS works, so please don't characterize NS as relative & nebulous.\n \n \n \n \n wascallywabbit:\n You guys can't even define what you mean by 'selection'.

Can you tell us that?\n \n \n \n walking-fish:\n Well understood scientific terms, like natural selection, don't go by what you find in standard dictionaries written for non-scientists. Electrons don't really spin and subatomic particles are not really particles. Natural selection means that organisms that are well adapted to the environment tend to survive long enough to reproduce and pass their traits onto offspring, and sexual selection refers to the ability to successfully mate so that they can actually pass traits onto future generations. Male spiders that are not adept at performing the right mating rituals are likely to be eaten by the female instead of mating with her. A mutation in evergreen trees that prevents them from producing the natural antifreeze that allows them to survive the winter, will make them less well adapted to the environment. Why is it so hard for you to understand what the word, selection, means in this context? Sorry for being arrogant, but that's why I asked the question about whether you have ever taken a course in biology. What I am saying is really basic, well known, stuff in biology.",

I meant to say, POST HOC - not ad hoc. That's a fallacy where the concurence of two things is automatically assumed to be the result of a cause & effect relationship. With respect to social darwinism, it's the belief that the misuse of darwinian language to justify the existence of social classes implies that Darwin's theory was a direct result of the social conditions of his time. You have failed to show any evidence of this. All you do is make implications... but, no supporting evidence. In other words, a correlation between two things does not mean that one caused the other.",
