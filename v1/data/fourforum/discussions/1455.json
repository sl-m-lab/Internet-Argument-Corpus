But the problem I see in this is that of the interpretation itself. I have been told repeatedly that the bible and it's contents are timeless, and while this may or may not be true, I do not think the same can be said of one person's (or one group of persons) take on what the bible is saying. You say that the orthodox church is the sole authority, but obviously it has to be only certain members of the church. While one man may see the bible as a reference point for his day, isn't it possible that the same passage may be reinterpreted as the years pass? Is there never a problem as the bible is transmitted to another language, complete with its own subtleties? Does your church make allowances for modern scholars to reinterpret the bible, or are you expected to have the same understanding as man living hundreds of years ago?\n \n In the case of buddhism, there are literally thousands of sutras, passed down through the years through both written and oral traditions. There is not one collections such as the bible, both because this one collection would literally fill an entire library, but also because the different sects choose to focus on different sutras at different times. As the teachings have passed through numerous cultures and thousands of years, they have changed, as well as the imagery and symbolism. Along with the actual sutras, there are innumerable commentaries done on certain works- trying to better interpret them. All of these works are encouraged by Mahayana followers, hoping that each individual person can come to his own conclusions... his own realization of what the buddha intended. My own teacher makes changes in our liturgy so that the words in it are easier for us westerners to grasp, while still upholding the message of the text. for example substituting the word land for nation, believing that our good will not stop at these imaginary lines on the map.\n I think one of the biggest problems with judic religions is that people are encouraged to follow the interpretations of others, though they may not \"mesh\" well with their modern life. For example- ine church usually agrees on what version of the bible they will study, dismissing any other version, although the wording of a different version may be easier for a certain person to grasp. My mother does not like the King James version of the bible, but as a teenager encountering other versions, she was told that the messgae within had been \"adulterated\" or was \"antithetical\".\n Perhaps the biggest difference between our religions is that we buddhists are hoping to surpass the understanding of all of our teachers, and reach complete enlightenment and become buddhas. While you god followers never expect to become gods yourselves, as I understand it, you merely hope to live on in heaven and continue to serve your god.",
