   "New Prop. 8 court challenge brings former legal rivals together \n 11:06 AM | May 27, 2009\n \n \n The California Supreme Court failed to protect gay couples' fundamental right to marry when it upheld Proposition 8, forcing same-sex couples to appeal to the federal courts to remedy the injustice, two prominent lawyers said today in announcing a lawsuit on behalf of two gay couples.\n \n Former U.S. Solicitor General Theodore Olson, a renowned conservative, and David Boies, who opposed Olson in Bush v. Gore in the 2000 fight over the presidential election, cast their collaborative effort to restore the right of gays to marry in California as a moral imperative to correct an injustice. Their suit seeks an immediate injunction on Prop. 8's ban, thereby allowing same-sex marriages to resume while the case makes its way through the federal court system.\n \n But Olson's role in the gay rights mission prompted much speculation about his motives. The former Bush administration official, who lost his wife in the Sept. 11 terror attacks, conceded that the federal courts might not be ready to recognize sexual orientation as a class in need of protection from discrimination, but he said he hoped \"that people don't suspect my motives,\" vowing to demonstrate his commitment to equal rights by winning the challenge.\n \n Boies vouched for Olson as \"committed in heart and soul to equality and committed in heart and soul to the Constitution.\"\n \n Both lawyers, flanked by the two gay couples they represent in the lawsuit, compared the fight for same-sex marriage rights to previous civil rights campaigns and said it was wrong to urge their clients to wait for their fundamental rights for another decade or longer because of the current conservative domination of the federal bench.\n \n --Carol J. Williams\n \n Photos: Attorneys Theodore B. Olson, right, and David Boies take questions during a press conference Wednesday morning at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles.

   "Here it comes. I hope this is not a bad time to bring a federal lawsuit. Note that the suit challenges the California constitutional ban on same-sex marriage as a violation of the equal protection and due process clauses of the 14th amendment. \n \n The problem is that once people lose a federal lawsuit, it sets a precedent that is usually very difficult to overturn. \n \n I think that a better approach to winning in California would be to mount a campaign to amend the state constitution to remove the provision banning same-sex marriage. I think we probably need to do more work at the grassroots changing attitudes and changing state laws before we go to federal court. But we cannot stop plaintiffs from suing. That's up to them.",

Keep the issue in the light and keep the movement going.\n\n \n The problem with bringing a federal lawsuit is that losing before the U.S. Supreme Court will set the marriage equality movement back for years, maybe decades. A Supreme Court precedent is a huge barrier. Remember Bowers v. Hardwick. We were lucky that the Supreme Court 17 years later took the rare step of overturning the Bowers v. Hardwick ruling. That happens very infrequently. \n \n Several lawyers and activists who have worked on marriage equality their whole careers are worried about this lawsuit, which is being filed by plaintiffs represented by two hot shot lawyers with no experience in arguing same-sex marriage cases. The lawyers and activists with experience worry that this is an ill-timed lawsuit that could completely muck up the long-term strategy that people working for marriage equality have pursued. I personally hope that the case never gets to the Supreme Court and never gets ruled on. I don't think the current Supreme Court will rule in our favor, and losing a case before the Supreme Court would be a terrible setback.",

Now, if you are of the opinion that the 14th amendment meant and as always meant to protect based upon only race, religion and sexual orientation than I'd like to see some proof of that.\n\n \n I made no mention of the 14th amendment as being meant to protect race, religion or sexual orientation. Actually the 14th amendment makes no reference to race at all. With the exception of Indians who will not be counted for the proportion of elected congressmen (which is irrelevant to this discussion). What the 14th amendment says (in plain English no less) is \"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" Now, you can argue that the 14th amendment only applies to race and I'm sure many if not most who supported the 14th amendment surely sought to limit the amendment to only blacks and nobody else. The 14th amendment has been used barring discrimination from Chinese citizens and even later to allow blacks to sit on juries and vote which was probably not the original intention of the 14th amendment. Many thought that the 14th amendment meant that \"Separate but Equal\" was perfectly legal and satisfied the 14th, today we know that it indeed does not. So, I know you want to stick with the original meaning, whatever that may be and quite possibly not completely known as it requires a lot of people to agree on something before an amendment can be ratified. Was it ever intended for homosexuals? No, however homosexuals were considered perverts and mentally ill at the time and hence if they couldn't participate as full citizens, they had their due process....they were considered heathens and a social pariah. \n \n So, what do we do? Do we strap ourselves into the Way-Back machine and try to pretend we understand 100% what politicians in the late 1800s meant and apply those EXACT same meanings to today? Or do we follow the actual words of the amendment itself? If they meant blacks or former slaves then why didn't they just say so? Or, if it were simply just about race, then how came that was never mentioned once in the entire amendment? You'd think if that was their intention to include all races then why not be a little bit more descriptive?

   "Of course you know what my view is, same sex marriage should be legal. I asked you how my view is \"selfish\". So...again I ask. Why are you saying I'm selfish when you know what my view on the subject is? Anyway, go back, read your own post responding to me, there was no \"general sense\" of the word \"you\". You (specifically you) were referring directly to me.\nI never said you were selfish as I was using the general sense of the word. If I mistyped something I apologize. In any event, wanted same sex marriage legal is not by itself selfish and I'm not saying that is selfish. If you add on \"by any means needed\" than it is selfish.\n \n \nI made no mention of the 14th amendment as being meant to protect race, religion or sexual orientation.\n I did and this is what we are talking about is it not? The entire thread started by someone posting a comment about the California AG talking about the 14th amendment.\n \n\n So, what do we do? Do we strap ourselves into the Way-Back machine and try to pretend we understand 100% what politicians in the late 1800s meant and apply those EXACT same meanings to today?\nYes because this is what was voted on and approved. EVERY law works this way but somehow people think it shouldn't work for the provisions of the constitution. And if you don't know the meaning than you can't apply it now can you.\n \n \nI believe the amendment was meant to be all inclusive and at the time homosexuals were not even taken into consideration, it was hidden from society, we're in a different time now. \nThat is fine but either you base this on \"what politicians in the late 1800s meant and apply those EXACT same meanings to today\" or you simply have decided that is what you want it to mean. If the later than you are selfish. If the former than I'd like to see some proof for that because no one else can certainly show it...nor do they pretend to.\n \n \nNow as for your silly \"everything goes\" argument and why there are restrictions in some cases such as age limits on drivers licenses. We all have to abide by the same laws. We all have to be 16 before we can drive a car. \n And we all have to abide by the rule of marrying the opposite sex. \n \n \nNow, a question for you. If Alabama voted to not allow gays to be issued drivers licenses, which part of the constitution would that violate? Or, would that act be perfectly legal?\nIt would not go against any provision of the US constitution (I don't know Alabama law). The people were granted Due Process so it doesn't violate that. Equal protection doesn't appear to mean \"you have to justify a reason for discrimination\". It is more meaning you can't not apply a law to some people that actually does apply to them. \n \n That may sound horrific to many but the constitution clearly gave the majority of power to the people and the courts with the least amount of power.",

If you add on \"by any means needed\" than it is selfish.\n\n \n I understand, and really no big deal but this is what you said:\n \n \nBecause that is not in the constitution...that it is difficult to understand. The California AG stated it violated the 14th amendment because of bogus ideas like substantive due process or an insane reading of \"equal protection of the laws\". I wish people would just be honest and say they want the 14th amendment to mean anything they believe is wrong is unconstitutional. Look at your post...you don't think it should be based on ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation. That's nice, but what about age, disability, or intelligence? Surely someone would say \"well you can have a good reason for those\" but you merely get back to opinion and your own preferences and most importantly you stray away from what the amendment even means. When it comes down to it you just have a selfish view on what the constitution should mean.\n\n \n You see? You are specifically calling me \"selfish\" and not in a general sense. But, like I said, it's no big deal and I called your argument \"silly\", which wasn't really cool either, so, let's just move on.\n \n \nYes because this is what was voted on and approved. EVERY law works this way but somehow people think it shouldn't work for the provisions of the constitution. And if you don't know the meaning than you can't apply it now can you.\n\n \n Yes, but (as Ohioprof pointed out) even the founding fathers didn't agree 100% with the document they were putting together, laws are written all the time that will need clarification by the courts, unless you think the public should be voting for every dotted i and crossed t?\n \n \nThat is fine but either you base this on \"what politicians in the late 1800s meant and apply those EXACT same meanings to today\" or you simply have decided that is what you want it to mean. If the later than you are selfish. If the former than I'd like to see some proof for that because no one else can certainly show it...nor do they pretend to.\n\n \n That's a good questions but when the 14th amendment begins with \"All persons\", then what do you think they mean? At this point you can, just like me give your opinion. But I believe the spirit of the law is to say \"All persons\" and not \"All persons (i.e. negros only)\". There was no mention of race, why? Should we go back and say that \"All persons\" doesn't mean men, women, every race, creed and color and sexual orientation? They all fall under \"All persons\". I don't know, I understand your point but I feel pretty confident in saying that if we simply interpreted the 14th (or any portion of the constitution) to the limited definitions of that time then this country would be for the worse. I believe our forefathers understood this and expected future generations to define the constitution according to the times they live in. Either way, like it or not, there is precedent to do just that. You can't undo it....it would be deemed unconstitutional to take away anyone's rights after they have been granted. \n \n Anyway, we could go around and rehash a conversation you already had with Ohioprof for which she would do a much better job than I. Hell, I'd probably just go back and quote her anyway. \n \n Bottom line, it's eventually going to be in the court's hands to interpret the law, that's how it works these days and you have the Scalias and Breyers of the world who will make that decision so at least the laws have and will continue to be vetted by every sort of the political spectrum.",
