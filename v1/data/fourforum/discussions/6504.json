I used the last name only. Make sure to select \"All Offenders, Past and Present\" to find released inmates.\n \n Robert Arthur Merrill, born in 1945, was convicted for child molestation and spent 8 years with no eligibilty for parole.\n \n Raymond Carl Ratley, of 1938 vintage, was convicted for child molestation and spent 3 years with no eligibilty for parole.\n \n The list of sex offenders in this zip is long but these are not the guys in this zip code convicted of non-child related cases like like adult rape or even statutory rape where the victims are older children. These are dirty old perverts specifically convicted of playing with children. What is wrong in bringing the identity of these guys publicly to the attention of the community when both chose to move within 100 yards of a secondary school and within 500 yards of an elementary school. There are plenty of neighborhoods without schools these guys could live in. If you lived in this neigborhood with your kids in these schools, would you want to know that these guys moved in?\n \n BTW Wez, do you really question the truth of the Georgia GBI and the Georgia Dept. Of Corrections just because this info is available online?\n\n \n \n Looking at Ratley (Didn't look at the other one) this guy has one conviction. You don't even know what the circumstances of the crime was. Considering it was 3 years, my guess is that it wasn't as serious as some cases. And you go around and make this guy feel like XXXX? Tell me something. Do you drink alcohol? If so have you ever been drunk? If so, give me your picture and I will post it around your city calling you a drunken fool. Have you ever speed before? If so, I am going to post your picture and call you a wreckless driver. \n Having limits on where they live is one thing, but to be a jerk and harrass the guy is another.

Wow, is this that hard to believe? Even then ones that are convicted as \"child molesters\" may not be a threat as you see it. I actually look up cases and get facts before I make judgements about others. You seem to only be afraid of sex offenders but don't even realize that you endanger your kids more so by allowing drunk drivers to still drive, robbers to continue to live in your area, and people that have been convicted of assault and battery to work at the school your kids go to. Get the facts and learn that tearing down a person that has been convicted ONCE is not that big of a threat....just like Todd was in the case shown on these forums.\n \n \nGranted, the Illinois state sex offender website only informs as to if the victim was over or under 18 years of age...but state law says all convicted offenders CAN NOT pass out candy to children on Oct. 31st. It is a violation of their parole. As it should be.\n So shouldn't they take up my suggestions? If you want to keep the public safe we can't let a drunk driver ever drive again and do the other 3 I suggested.

Your guy that served 3 years didn't even harm the person since he wasn't convicted with aggrevated child molestation.
