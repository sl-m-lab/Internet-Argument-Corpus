   "Yet another legacy of George W. Bush:\n \nThink globally, suffer locally. This could be the moral of \"Methland,\" Nick Reding's unnerving investigative account of two gruesome years in the life of Oelwein, Iowa, a railroad and meatpacking town of several thousand whipped by a methamphetamine-laced panic whose origins lie outside the place itself, in forces almost too great to comprehend and too pitiless to bear. The ravages of meth, or \"crank,\" on Oelwein and countless forsaken locales much like it are shown to be merely superficial symptoms of a vaster social dementia caused by, among other things, the iron dominion of corporate agriculture and the slow melting of villages and families into the worldwide financial stew....\n \n \"Methland\" begins quietly and solemnly, with a ballad of cultural invisibility. Reding, a loyal native of the Midwest who's frankly sentimental about its past and starkly lucid about its likely future, invites his rushing readers to gaze down at the \"flyover country\" of America and see not a grid of farms and county roads but a patchwork of failed institutions and aspirations. There's the hospital, groaning under a load of uninsured patients with #minimum-wage jobs and maxed-out household budgets. There's the school, imperiled by dwindling tax receipts and students with ever more grown-up problems. And there, on a street in a district of drab houses not far from the faltering central business district, is a passel of latter-day Tom Sawyers on bikes, riding along not for the summertime heck of it but to shake up batches of low-grade speed contained in plastic soda jugs lashed to their back fenders.\n \n It's magnificently potent stuff, this meth, whose crudest versions are concocted from a mash of over-the-counter cold pills and flesh-eating bulk industrial chemicals. Just a few grains of it, snorted through scarred nostrils and allowed to saturate stressed synapses, can keep a person awake and going for days. And that's not an entirely bad thing here, where survival means working harder for less each year, from late shift to day shift, until perception blurs....\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/books/review/Kirn-t.html\n \n \nthe iron dominion of corporate agriculture and the slow melting of villages and families into the worldwide financial stew\n\n Immense corporate power obliterating mere humans, crushing their destinies.",

   "How eloquently Kirn writes of the destruction of the American soul:\n \nThe agricultural conglomerates that have gobbled up Oelwein and similar farm towns may feed the world, but they starve the folks who work for them, breeding a craving for synthetic stimulants that conveniently sap the appetite while enlarging the body's capacity for toil. These offal-streaked Dickensian mills are also magnets for desperate immigrant laborers who, in some cases, blaze the smuggling trails that run up into the Corn Belt from Mexico, home to the gang lords who own the superlabs that, increasingly, dominate the meth trade.\n",
