   "The New England Journal of Medicine reports that men who smoke risk cutting 7.3 years off their lives.\n \n Oxford University's International Journal of Epidemiology reports \"Life expectancy at age 20 for gay and bisexual men is 8 to 20 years less than for all men...nearly half of gay and bisexual men currently aged 20 will not reach their 65th birthday.\"\n \n Judging by the number of years at risk, homosexual activity is up to three times deadlier than smoking. Click on this link http://www.afa.net/homosexual_agenda/ha031901.asp and then click on the Oxford University link to get to the stats.\n \n What's causing nearly half of all gay and bisexual men to not reach their 65th birthday? What's making their lifestyle more deadly than smoking?\n \n 1.) HIV/AIDS impacts on mortality rates for gay and bisexual men(At the Oxford Link).\n \n The HIV/AIDS problem is caused by these things:\n \n A.) Men who have sex with men are 320%, yes, 320% MORE likely than heterosexuals to have UNPROTECTED sex WITHOUT telling their partners they're HIV positive. http://www.gayhealth.com/templates/0/news?record=136\n \n \n B.) Large numbers of gay and bisexual men have a high frequency of anonymous sex. They get ariound alot. This Centers For Disease Control And Prevention link proves that. Click here to see the proof.\n http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4835a1.htm\n \n \n And it isn't likely to get any better: The number of HIV cases is climbing among gay and bisexual men. HIV diagnoses for gay and bisexual men has increased by 17.7% since 1999. Data from July, 2003 Centers For Disease Control And Prevention\n http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/r030728a.htm\n \n This lifestyle is a dangerous one and should not be promoted as a healthy, safe alternative. Want to push the odds to nearly 50% that you will NOT make it to 65? Want an early death?Then embrace the gay and bisexual lifestyle.",

   "U.S. heterosexuals are less likely to go for an HIV test...\n http://sanantonio.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/stories/2003/11/24/daily12.html\n \n How do they know what they have, and whom they are infecting?\n \n AIDS is not just a gay disease...\n \n :: Sub- Sahara Africa \n In 2003, 26.6 million people were living with HIV, including 3.2 million who became infected in the past 12 months. AIDS killed approximately 2.3 million people in the same year. This made the region by far the worst-affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Women are more likely to be infected than men. \n In South Africa , the average rate of HIV prevalence in pregnant women attending antenatal clinics was about 25 percent. It is estimated that 5.3 million South Africans were living with HIV at the end of 2002. Because it is a relatively recent epidemic, and given current trends, AIDS deaths will continue to increase rapidly over the next five years. \n In four neighboring countries, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland, HIV prevalence has reached extremely high levels without signs of leveling off. Infection rates in Botswana and Swaziland are around 39 percent. HIV prevalence in antenatal sites in Namibia rose to over 23 percent in 2002. Lesotho's most recent data shows median HIV prevalence among antenatal clinic attendees climbing to 30 percent.\n http://www.worldbank.org/worldaidsday/charts.htm\n \n http://www.worldvision.org.nz/news/archive/20020717-01.asp\n \n It would seem to me that if AIDS discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation, lesbians must be God's or nature's chosen and most protected people. Of course, AIDS is a virus and it does not discriminate.",
