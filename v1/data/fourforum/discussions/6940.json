   "And the problem is when the High School has Coke but not Pepsi!:p \n \n But seriously, are you referring to vending machines or in ala cart lunch options. When I was in high school, they had both. I usually didn't like what was offered in the vending machines (which by the way, for pop, we did have the darn Coke and no Pepsi, darn it.emoticon_xclown ) But we also had \"junk food\" in the ala cart choices which I did try and go for. They looked better than the stuff in the vending machine and seemed to, in some respects, have a healthier value to them (sometimes.) That of course, depended on what was offered. Now, I've been out of K-12 education for nearly 4 years now but if it still works the same, they should try to get some healthier items in the ala cart for the students to go after.\n \nI agree. My High School had pop machines, and some of the other schools in my area had candy machines, kid's were always munching on chips or chugging pop whether or not they were hungry/thirsty. I think that it becomes an \"I buy it because I can.\" type of a situation.\n If this theory of \"I buy it because I can\" is very much true, then this is a typical human mind set. Humans are the only animal to consume more than needed just because they can. (By the way, I've heard of a person going into a coma because they drank too much caffine.) If schools continue to have \"junk food\" they should have something that teaches that there is a limit of what is okay and what is too much. For example, a little sugar may not hurt a healthy person (diebetics can be hurt by this, though) but more sugar is bad. Some calaries are good for you. (Calaries give you energy to do things.) But it too has a limit on how much is too much. Some fruits are good, but a lot will make you sick. The more a person know about when to stop, the better.\n \n But to get to the point, I think it would be good if they put in healthy snacks and as they do that, gradually take out the \"junk food\". They can eventually phase it out all together.",

   "I've never been to a school where the water fountains worked\n \n\n Well maybe I'm just lucky. We have 6 sets of water fountains, 2 per floor. They all have 4 fountains in a row, and with every single set AT LEAST 2 work. That's at least 12 working fountains. Plus there is ONE fountain in the locker room as well as one right outside the gym so they don't have to unlock the locker room doors for kids to get a drink. So that's 14 water fountains that work, all free. Maybe I'm just lucky, but I thought most schools had working fountains.\n \n \n\n that's the thing: if you want that stuff you have the freedom to pack it and take it with you. All vending machines do is provide XXXX food that you end up eating when you have a several hour break between lessons in the middle of the day.\n\n \n \n Again, I take everything with me that I eat. We have 45 minutes for lunch, and 8 minutes between classes. 8 minutes is not enough time to buy something and eat it. All we really need is a lunch. I just pack a lunch every day and that is much cheaper than getting lunch at school let alone way better.\n \n But what's wrong with once in a while buying a soda? As long as a kid is responsible and keeps track of what they eat (I've had a chocolate bar, piazza, and a cookie, I'll have a soda now) and don't do what I put in parenthesies, a soda now and then is ok. The problem is these kids need to learn responsibility. We assume that by high school you can be responsible for yourself. You are responsible for getting to class, and on time. No one will stop you from being late, you'll just lose credit. If you want to stuff yourself with junk food, no one will stop you, but don't blame the school for getting you fat.\n \n But I do agree there should be alternatives offered. And the other problem comes when kids can't afford lunch and get free and reduced lunch from school. They are forced to buy school lunch and if not otehrwise for that reason alone, schools should be required to provide the opportunity for a kid to buy a healthy meal.",

   "Is this genuinely how it works in America? What age exactly is high school? Is there no mechanism for telling your parents or punishing you if you don't turn up to classes?\n\n \n Basically, there's a school. The bell rings a few minutes in advance to tell everyone to go to class. If you show up late to class, you get a tardy, and if you don't show up at all you get an unexcused absence. 3 tardies = 1 unexcused absence. 5 unexcused absences = LC, loss of credit. You have to retake the course again and it shows up as an F on a report card.\n \n As to notifying parents, I don't think they do at all until the kid actually has an LC. I got a note last year saying I had LC'd a class, apparently my baseball coach forgot to send the note in excusing me from class, but I got no warning at all before that. But I got that straightened out :)\n \n Now if you bring in a note as an excuse for missing they call the parent that day to verify. So basically it's up to you to get to class. If you don't they require a note (which they will call parents to verify, so they care about recording it as excused when it's not, but not about kids failing) to get it excused.\n \n Now obviously a teacher can call a parent for whatever reason. I'm not sure if that happens but the one class I'm in where people skip frequently (PE, at the beginning of the day, many kids just show up late) the teacher doesn't care. He marks them absent and the rest is up to the school. Now there's no way for the teacher to know if it's excused or not. So basically it's up to the kid to get to class, which isn't all that hard of a thing to do anyway.\n \n \n That's how it works at our school, I don't know if it's the same throughout the country, but high school is supposed to teach responsibility. The ages are usually around 14-18.",
