   "I'm not sure if anyone has posted this before... sorry if they did.\n \n http://www.godhatesfags.com\n \n Good morning gentle friend.\n \n Welcome to the Westboro Baptist Church homepage. This page is dedicated to preaching the Gospel truth about the soul-damning, nation-destroying notion that \"It is OK to be gay.\"\n \n \"GOD HATES FAGS\" -- though elliptical -- is a profound theological statement, which the world needs to hear more than it needs oxygen, water and bread. The three words, fully expounded, show:\n \n 1. the absolute sovereignty of \"GOD\" in all matters whatsoever (e.g., Jeremiah 32:17, Isaiah 45:7, Amos 3:6, Proverbs 16:4, Matthew 19:26, Romans 9:11-24, Romans 11:33-36, etc.),\n 2. the doctrine of reprobation or God's \"HATE\" involving eternal retribution or the everlasting punishment of most of mankind in Hell forever (e.g., Leviticus 20:13,23, Psalm 5:5, Psalm 11:5, Malachi 1:1-3, Romans 9:11-13, Matthew 7:13,23, John 12:39-40, 1 Peter 2:8, Jude 4, Revelation 13:8, 20:15, 21:27, etc.), and\n 3. the certainty that all impenitent sodomites (under the elegant metaphor of \"FAGS\" as the contraction of XXXXXXX, fueling the fires of God's wrath) will inevitably go to Hell (e.g., Romans 1:18-32, 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, 1 Timothy 1:8-11, Jude 7, etc.). (If you are concerned with our use of the word \"###\", please click here to find out why we use this word.) \n \n The only lawful sexual connection is the marriage bed. All other sex activity is whoremongery and adultery, which will damn the soul forever in Hell. Heb. 13:4. Decadent, depraved, degenerate and debauched America, having bought the lie that It's OK to be gay, has thereby changed the truth of God into a lie, and now worships and serves the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen! Rom. 1:25. But the Word of God abides. Better to be a eunuch if the will of God be so, and make sure of Heaven. Mat. 19:12. Better to be blind or lame, than to be cast into Hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched. Mk. 9:43-48. Abstain, you fools.\n \n God emoticon_xkill Americans because of the sins of Gays! LMAO\n \n The Phelps family are the type of people who takes a dump on the Christian religion. They appeared on the Tyra Banks show twice now, and the entire family seems to be like that. Even the little kids, which is sad because little kids should not be saying words like ### (if my little brother said that I'd take away his love... all of his video games until he realizes how bad the word was). On the show they also called Tyra a \"### enabler\" and that if she kept supporting homosexual ways that she too will go to hell. They came back onto the show a second time and this time they said that the people of 9/11 died because they were probably either fags or ### enablers themselves.\n \n But how far is too far? These people go to funerals of gay people (I believe specifically fallen soldiers) and picket. So at the request of the family of a fallen soldier, the group \"Patriot Guard Riders\" turn up in large numbers to screen the protesters from the family and to drown out their chants by singing patriotic songs or by revving their engines.\n \n http://www.patriotguard.org/ (why waste your donations on a church like the Phelps when you can support some really cool motorcycle guys?)\n \n Sorry to the mods and others for saying the censored three lettered word so many times... I'm just using it cause they did.",

You have NOT been reading my posts Archie! Your problem is that you have repeatedly ignored the facts of my life and other gay people's responsible lives. And honey... it is YOU that have relegated my marriage to that of an anus. it is YOU who have compared gays to having sex with animals. You are the biggest LIER on this forum. Gay sex IS normal ArseAngel. It has been talked about by Sam, Chemist, Lez, Shadow, Matthew and many MANY others. All of us have refuted your vile attempts to push us into a subserviant, less than equal position.

Never said that because I'm not. I just don't believe in YOUR god. I don't believe in the bible, so therefore, you can't come up with any other reason other than \"godsedit\" to justify hating me so much. You have no clue about my spiritual path, what I do every week in volunteer work. No damned clue because your too busy attacking us on the basis of you chosen interpretation of your chosen beliefs.\n \n \n \nNow as to Jesus speaking to people with the hard and brutal truth in the face of overt and blatant blasphemy they speak towards God ?

Just because you interpret a bunch of ancient writings in a certain way doesn't make it so. Perhaps you better make another phone call to god for some explanation.\n \n \nBut you know why he wasn't sinning when He said those things to them jyoshu ?

It sounds pretty ugly coming from someone else though huh ? Just remember that they're JSD sentiments, not mine.\n\n \n You haven't repeated correctly one thing I've said, AA. You are really afraid of the truth. YOu just twist the truth. All you do is spew bible hatred with no thought of your own. We challenge you and you just hate it. \n \n You've never asked once about my spiritual path, because you have no respect for anything except your religion or certainly have no respect for the homosexuals posting here. You have chastised almost every one of us. You have no idea what I do or have done with my life or what experiences many of the others on this board have had with their lives. Your pathetic attempt to take a holier-than-thou position is such a crock. No one believes you AA. This is why you hate me so much. I'm telling you that your religiosity is far far FAR away from from being spiritually developed. You know I'm right. But now you have to make up stories about how I'm an atheist, how I've relegated heterosexuality to having sex with animals.... which I have NEVER said. You on the other hand, have, and now you blame me for it. This is such a sophmoric attempt to reverse opinion. You can be so infantile.\n \n Remember Archie. I was raised by fundamentalist parents. My older bro and I were gay. My parents were so hard on him, he committed suicide. After getting severely physically beaten by my christer parents, my gay doctor and his partner were made my legal custodians. My parents and my church made life hell for all. All in the name of your god.\n \n I do believe in God archie. But not yours. My eyes were opened at an early age. I have also learned that the spiritual path in life (some would call it the moral path) has many faces. For some it is Jesus, for some it is Wicca. For me, I went on a 1 year buddist silent retreat, visited tibet, worked with the Tich Nat Hanh. Went to lectures by the Dali Lama, Soygal Rimpoche. I spent some intense years in therapy. I even did a vision quest with an indian tribe in New Mexico. I found a lot of answers. The beauty of a spiritual (moral) path is that is forever changing and forever expanding. Right now I am finding spiritual satisfaction by reading to blind kids every week (even though my german absolutely stinks!). In the 80s/90s, I volunteered several times a week at an AIDS hospice. I believe that we truly find \"god\" only when we do something good for other people. Now I'm working on a project to teach blind kids a martial art. Two years ago I received a black belt in Tae Kwon Do, (right after that I had a small heart attack, go figure!).\n \n There you have some personal information on me. I don't find spirituality in life by reading an ancient book that has so many interpretations. I use life to be my teacher. I ask god, the universe, to help me make decisions.\n \n So, these are some of the things I am. I just happen to be gay. I'm already married to a man. Many of my friends in the states already have children and are doing quite wonderfully. The fact is, I'm full of love in my life. I'm not some depressed homosexual that you've always been told about. It's reality AA. Pure and simple. This is my story, Sam, Matthew, OhioProf, Lez Shadow and the rest have their stories too. Some exciting, some not so exciting. We're already part of this world. We're already married. We already have kids. Lay off AA. You've lost because you cannot change the lives we've already lived. You might just listen and learn for a change.",

That's because it isn't Spiritual Truth you seek at all, but universal acceptance of a narcissistic and dangerous lifestyle.\n\n \n I had to look up the word reprobate when you first brought it up. I had no clue what it meant. \n rep\u00b7ro\u00b7bate /&#712;r&#603;pr&#601;&#716;be&#618;t/ Pronunciation Key - Show Spelled Pronunciation[rep-ruh-beyt] Pronunciation Key - Show IPA Pronunciation noun, adjective, verb, -bat\u00b7ed, -bat\u00b7ing. \n -noun \n \n 1. a depraved, unprincipled, or wicked person: a drunken reprobate. \n 2. a person rejected by God and beyond hope of salvation. \n -adjective 3. morally depraved; unprincipled; bad. \n 4. rejected by God and beyond hope of salvation. \n -verb (used with object) 5. to disapprove, condemn, or censure. \n 6. (of God) to reject (a person), as for sin; exclude from the number of the elect or from salvation. \n Thank you so much for your christian opinion. Works like a charm.\n \n By the way, you just called me my ilk narcissistic and dangerous. YOu don't even know me. Despite my story I have shared with you, you can't deal with the truth of our individual lives because it doesn't not fit into the propaganda that you were taught or the propaganda that you spew. You have been presented real facts of real lives of real homosexuals. The problem is that we fly in the face of what you deem is true. And you still call me a liar, reprobate and shallow. Those are your words, AA.\n \n You are an enemy of homosexuals, AA. You can wrap it up in any christian-moral packaging that you want, but you have proved time and time again that you find us reprehensable.\n \n I'm married to a man. He has my last name. We have a wonderful life together. We love each other. We work, we pay taxes. I have many gay friends raising, quite successfully, their children.\n \n The sky has not fallen except around your unfounded arguments.\n \n I don't want to be saved by your chosen beliefs, AA. It interests me not. I don't need it and I don't want it because I already know what truth with God that works for me. If the bible works for you, then fine. But every time you call us liars and reprobates and damned and, as most recently in this post, narcissitic and dangerous, you lose all credibility. Those names you just called me reflect EXACTLY what I think of you. I would bet that the words \"narcissitc and dangerous\" would be how many people on this board would describe you.",

The only thing that can truly be denied is implementation.\n\n \n Well in practice, if you wish to deny someone their beliefs, you punish things you believe would be associated with such beliefs. For example, if you wish to prohibit the belief that \"gays are evil\", you punish employers who do not hire an appropriate number of gay staff, or who use certain words to describe someone. Or you prohibit them from teaching such beliefs to their children, or demand they send their children to schools where such beliefs are ridiculed.\n \n So in practice prohibiting beliefs cannot be accomplished directly, but methods can be employed to prevent the expression and transmission of such beliefs.\n \n This is of course quite different from prohibiting the implementation of certain beliefs, for example if someone believed guns were evil, they would certainly be allowed to talk about it, but the constitution would, at least in theory, prohibit them from making a law to enforce their ideals.",

The fundamentalist \"ilk\" just don't want to accept that we're already in this world with marriages and families. This is already happening and will continue to happen. Maybe it won't be fully accepted, worldwide, in our lifetime, but it's a momentum that won't be stopped. It won't even be stopped by some fundie's interpretation of god. The more they spew their hate, the more fired up we get!\n\n \n I recently moved next door to a Pentecostal family. My lover and I have been together 10 years next July. I made it clear that we are a gay couple and wasn't received well in the beginning. Since then, I have offered help with buying them groceries when they had hard times. Her husband was recently layed off work and I got her husband a job through my family amongst many other things. The point is that both her and her children tell me that myself and my lover as the nicest neighbors they have ever had. The kindest people she says. I think her attitudes are changing, they just need to meet us gay people to see that we are kind, responsible, loving people. \n Now let's just hope she doesn't go to the ballot box to prevent me from taking care of my partner were he to become ill or many other benefits we seek.",

All of these people deserve to believe how they see fit. \n \n When a religion trys to assert much influence on government this is where it crosses the line. The problem is that many religious people only have respect for THEIR beliefs. They are they only ones that are right, everyone else is wrong, immoral, and leading the country to destruction. This is NOT what our country was founded on but has been the direction for quite a long time now. That is why we still have many oppressed people in our country and other countries around the world.\n\n \n I agree that every person has the right to believe whatever he wishes, including not believing in ancient myths, legends and superstitions. I also believe that a non-believer has every right to find a religious person's beliefs and support of religious institutions to be an ignorant behavior, which I do. And I will fight to keep those behaviors out of government, by voting for people who see the world in a secular way.",

   "IMO, calling homosexuality a \"tendency\" is akin to calling it a choice. If you do think it is a choice, are you going to believe your church or every single gay person that you will ever meet that will tell you it is not. Not to mention EVERY credible medical association on earth. \n And thus goes back to the \"nature vs. nurture\" debate. \n \n \nAnyhow, you believe homosexuality to be immoral, fine. That is your opinion and you can believe what you want.\nI appreciate that\n \n \nMy opinion? It is immoral to ask or even expect a human being to live a life without the love, affection, companionship and the ability to grow old with someone you love.\nAnd you get no argument from me, but therein lies a very interesting question: What defines love?? \n \n \nA loving God, IMO, would not give me life, then expect me to suppress who I am, who I believe he made me, to the point of depression, alcholism and very possibly suicide.\nBut this same loving G-d also sets rules and standards to govern our lives so that we may be able to live freely. \n \n \nJust because I could possibly force myself to live a depraved miserable life, certainly doesn't make it right. Suppressing your sexual orientation is not just denying yourself sex, that's the last thing on my mind. It's denying myself love. It is not akin to suppressing your alcoholism, gambling addiction or whatever it gets compared to.\nDebatable, but I am not willing to go there at this time.",
