   "Evolution looks to explain itself by the succesive iterations of morpholgoy and functionality. Or so it seems. \n \n 1) what am I missing in the statement above?\n\n \"Evolution\" doesn't explain itself; evolution is simply a change in the gene pool of a population. It is Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection that attempts to explain evolution.\n \n A summary of natural selection:\n Natural selection is a process by which organisms with specific traits survive. Any gene or trait that allows an organism to reproduce better will appear more in a population, because more offspring with this trait are born.\n What happens because of this is a change in the traits of a population.\n \n \n2) Just because something has changed from one age to the next, this does not necessarily mean that one begat the other.\n\n I don't know exactly what you mean, but I assume you mean that orgainsms that look similar are not necessarily related.\n \n The fossil record shows a large number of different species with definite similarities. There are species of humanlike and monkeylike animals as well as other animals with obvious similarities to modern-day species. No, this doesn't mean that a monkey-like organism was the ancestor of a monkey, but it does suggest that.\n \n \n3) I understand the concept of pointing to common ancestors although not necessarily identifying the specific ancestor. What genetic evidence is used and how is that compared with other organisms statistically.\n\n Again, I don't know exactly what you mean by that, so I will do the best I can.\n \n For the second part: DNA testing of fossils is often done, as is carbon-14 dating, and examination of the fossils themselves. These tests are compared to look for patterns (and to see if the obvious similarities are backed up by other evidence).\n For example: if a fossil was found that had a monkey-like skeleton, DNA testing would establish any relations to living species, and carbon dating would allow scientists to know when it lived.",

   "Truly just looking for an education on the subject of evolution. Pandion seems to have a plethora of knowledge and his particular background is appropriate but anyone is welcome to post.\nOK then. I'll assume that you are actually just looking for information, contrary to what I would normally believe.\n \n If you are really interested in learning, I can suggest some books. However, that would take some considerable effort and an open mind.\n \nEvolution looks to explain itself by the succesive iterations of morpholgoy and functionality. Or so it seems. \n \n 1) what am I missing in the statement above?\nYou are missing the fact that the theory of evolution is the explanation for the observations. Evolution does not explain itself. The theory of evolution explains things from the single genetic code for all living organisms, to the observed nested hierarchy, to the progression of life apparent in the fossil record, to why organisms seem designed for their environment. I'll say it again, because it's important and might clear up some of your profound confusion. The theory of evolution does not explain itself. The observations of living organisms lead to the theory of evolution. The theory of evolution is not a goal of science but a conclusion.\n \n2) Just because something has changed from one age to the next, this does not necessarily mean that one begat the other.\nWell, that was badly stated. But we've been over this before and you still don't seem to grasp. No one claims that any particular living animal is descended from any particular fossil. However, given the nature of life that we do observe, where we can see many species of equus, 36 species of cat, 28 species of canid, 8 or 10 species of bear (with as many more extinct species), 850,000 species of beetle, and on and on, we conclude that life was similar in the past. And while we can look at a fossil species of theropod dinosaur and find many avian characteristics, we do not conclude that this fossil was ancestral to birds. But we know that there were probably many species of theropods that had avian characteristics, just like there are many animals with cat-like features. Recent discoveries are bearing out that conclusion. So we don't say that this fossil is ancestral to that fossil or to this living organism. But we do say that this fossil shows characteristics that we would expect in an ancestral form. Thus, Archaeopteryx is not claimed to be ancestral to birds - in fact, is is believed to have eventually gone extinct (in all three known species). What we do say is that Archaeopteryx shows characteristics of both theropod dinosaurs and birds. Is in one of a broad lineage of many species with such characteristics, at least one of which is ancestral to modern birds (but we can't determine which one or ones that might be).\n \n And we haven't even gotten into the question of derived morphology. Why don't we assume that dogs are descended from some very dog-like artiodactyl? In fact, why do we conclude that these dog-like animals are, in fact, artiodactyls?\n \n3) I understand the concept of pointing to common ancestors although not necessarily identifying the specific ancestor. What genetic evidence is used and how is that compared with other organisms statistically.\nDoesn't seem that you understand the concept from the question 2, above. You want to know specifically about genetics? Before the ability to rapidly decode genetic sequences was developed, other methods were used. For example, DNA-DNA hybridization was used to compare relatedness of various animals. One study with which I am familiar was a study of primates. The out-group was a rabbit. It was these studies that returned the 98.4% similarity between humans and chimpanzees. The studies returned numbers that matched perfectly with the expected relationships, right down to the fact that the rabbit was not closely related to any primate, and in fact showed about the same genetic distance from all primates - just as expected.\n \n Other methods have been used and return slightly different numbers. Some whole genome studies return numbers of around 95% between humans and chimpanzees, while studies limited to a few significant genes have yielded numbers a bit above 99%. The degree of relatedness depends on what you are comparing.\n \n Now that the human genome has been decoded and the chimpanzee genome is being worked on, comparisons of specific gene sequences have shown a striking similarity. The data are pointing to the conclusion that there may be fewer differences than we have assumed, but the differences are in very important developmental genes.\n \nI realize these are big questions and am willing to take the time.\nGood. That's a beginning.",

Indeed, I trust my faith far more than what evolution tells me about the fundamental foundations of reality.\n \n I do not hold two contradictory philosophies.",

   "Just as an FYI. I am currently reading two of the sources listed. (i am reading about 5 other books for classes though). Please be patient. I do intend to ask some questions in the near future.\n \n I am currently reading: \"Evolutionary Biology\" and \"Science and Earth History\"\n \n I am finding it interesting. So far, and I am only a short way into both, I find some basic assumptions about creationist thinking that is generally applied may be incorrect assumptions. I will wait until I am further in to decide that though as I may simply be misunderstanding the principles which I believe are coming in more detail. \n \n In the meantime, I simply wanted you all to know that I appreciated your input and that I am taking the subject seriously.\n \n Sincerely,\n \n EF",
