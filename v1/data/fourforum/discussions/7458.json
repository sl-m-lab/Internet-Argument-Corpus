I say NO! Here is a shining example. New York State is quite possibly the most screwed-up state when it comes to tax-and-spend politics. Politicians on both sides of the aisle have failed to understand that lower taxes and lower spending create an environment conducive for private sector growth. Unfortunately, and no thanks to the Downstate Dummies (State assemblymen and Senators, for those of you in Rio Linda), the rest of Albany doesn't get it. Now, what does this have to do with our country? Simple. The right way to spur economic growth is to not only cut taxes, but cut spending as well.",

   "One issue that Bassman is forgetting is social stability. The main reason for social programs and progressive taxes.\n \n A country with a high level of income disparity has a society that is going to have a stability problem. The people at the lower end of the economic scale are not going to particularly happy about their lot in life if they are living in slums, with poor education and poor health care. This can lead to higher crime, riots and even radical political parties that appeal to the baser(sp) instincts of those near the bottom ( ie Communistic or right wing racist nationalistic parties ) None of these are good for the long term economic interests of a country, higher taxes for the better off are a means of keeping the masses from rising up and burning their houses down in a rampage class inequality, or racism derived from poor economic performance by the poorer.\n \n One will notice that in countries that have high income inequality, the long term economic performance is generally rather poor if the country has not recognized the problem. Brazil for instance. \n \n China is another possible future example. While it has a very very high level of income inequality, the poorer farmers are improving their lot providing them hope for their future. If China's economy should stop growing and the farmers economic lot stop growing, the chances of severe social disruption are high.

Due to this and our FICA payroll tax are now the cause of our lower income wage earners being taxed much greater (than intended) proportions of their incomes.

Due to this, FICA's an additional drag upon our nation's economy and particularly upon our median wage].\n \n We fail to acknowledge the actual portions of working poor's' wages that paid for taxes. Middle income wage earners pay greater rates.
