However, it is clear to see from the history and tradition of our laws, that regulating abortion was permitted up until those seven supreme moral beings in 1973 determined that the people were no longer wise enough to govern themselves.\n \n Also, it is not hard to show that what the law currently says does not necessarily mean that the current law is either right or just. For instance, in 1860 current law said that a white person could own a black person as a piece of property.
