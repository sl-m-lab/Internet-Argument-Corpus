Post 9/11, Bin Laden was very open with his plans regarding the united states. He said up fron that the plan was to bleed us out financially. All he felt he needed to do was carry out an occasional attack, just enough to keep the US government spending billions chasing the Al Queda ghost all over the world. As US public apathy increases, we will almost certainly see a couple more strikes.\n \n Say what you will about Bin Laden, from a fionancial standpoint, the man is a genius, as well as managing to garner Jesus like reverance from a large protion of the Arab world. He know how things lay, and that the US cannot actually afford to spend the money we have been putting on a show of fighting terrorism for public consumption. \n \n Current total losses to Al queda run in the tens of millions of dollars. US expenditures for homeland security, overseas wars in the name of fighting terrorism, debt service on those expenses, and devaluation of the dollar related to our little \"war\" are WELL over 1 trillion, plus the estimated trillion dollars lost as a result of the actual attack of 9/11.\n \n Since 9/11, Al queda has mroe than quadrupled in size, and has roughly 3 times the cash they did before, despite the fact that we are supposedly \"cracking down\" on them. In order to beat AQ, we needed the support fothe Arab community, muslims in particular. Killing off 100,000+ fo them was not a good way to start.\n \n The fact there has not been an attack on US soil (though attacks on US installations overseas has skyrocketed) is generally attributed to one of two things. The first is the possibility that AQ is growing so fast that they are having toruble keeping up with the increase in membership from an organizational standpoint. \n \n The second real possibility is that from his viewpoint,m he is beating us so badly doing nothing, that there is no reason to expend precios resources on further attacks. \n \n Read some of his speaches and public releases pre 9/11. He wanted the US military out of Saudi Arabis. It has been kicked out. He wanted the secular governmetn in Iraq gone, since he claimed that the governmetn of IRaq, being socialist, was a western government, and that the fact that the US had supported Saddam basically polluted it. He wanted deecreased American influence in the ME, and our failure to get sanctions passed against Syria, and the fact that Iran has essentially flipped us the bird regarding thier nuclear program, and the EU is pretty much giving them the thumbs up to do so, certinly shows that this goal has been met.\n \n BLs attacks coist money to carry out. Why waste it whern he can win by doing nothing? Never in his wildest wet dreams could he have actully expected his goal of a fundamentalaist governemtn in Iraq to be fulfilled, especially not one headed by the Iranian funded Dawa party. BUT, we did it! We got rid of that nasty, godless, secular governemn in Iraq and replaced it with Islamic Fundamentalists! \n \n \nIf Saddam had not been taken out I am not sure we would have been so lucky..............\n\n \n Is your period button stuck? \n \n Since there is absolutly no evidence of a Saddam/ AQ connection (except for the fact that more than once Saddam vioalted the \"no fly zone\" in the north to bomb Al Queda camps, and is probably responsible for the death of more AQ members than the US to date), and indeed no evidence that Saddam was supporting terrorists who were targeting the US, don't you think that such a conclusion is something of a stretch?\n \n Thank you President Bush........... emoticon_xhoho[/QUOTE]",

   "Iraq was a diversion in the middle east. Bush couldn't come out and say it. The big prize is Iran. Potentially, they are a bigger threat than Al Queda, if not already.\n\n \n I disagree. While i think that Iran is certianly a long term target, it seems to me that calling them a diversion may be going a little far.\n \n There were several things that I think contributed to the invasion of Iraq (none are related to WMDs).\n \n First, Iraw had shifted to a policy of only accepting Euros fro payment for their oil. this was a BAD, BAD thing for the US. One of the things that provides stability to the dollar is the fact that oil purchaes always required dollars. This created a demand for the dollar, regardless of economic conditions int he US, and helped stabilise it on the forex market. There has been talk about switching from a petro dollar to a petro euro. This would leave (literally) trillions of dollars out there floating in the market with no demand. Hyper inflation overnight. \n \n Second, we were kicked out of our military bases in Saudi Arabia. Very few countires in the region actually have suitable infrastructure to support large, active US bases. Iraq seemed the easy choice since their infrastructure was intact, but their military capability following 10 years of sanctions was negligible. It seemed like an easy victory.\n \n Third, Bush admin officials were predicting that within 1 year of our invasion of Iraq, democracy would sweep the middle east. In fact, Rumsfeld said \"sweep the middle east like a firestorm\". Instead, we had not managed to get even a shaky foothold for democracy in Iraq in the first year, and when we finally DID manage to get a government elected, it is led by Iranian funded islamic fundamentalists. This largely seemed to be american arrogance and the firmly seated belief that our system is the best in the world, the best the world has ever seen, and the best that the world ever will see. I think they truly believed that we would take out saddam and the Iraqis would be clamoring and petitioning to become the 51st state. Didn't quite go down like that.",

He has to communicate to the outside world via courier and donkey. And tell me again, how bin Laden gains by killing Muslims? I don't quite get that part.\n\n \n \n 70-80%? I doubt it, since we have only to date managed to seize 12.4 million of Al Quedas estimated 750 million dollars. It would seem like if we really had 70-80% of his top people, we would have been able to get more fo AQs money. The truth of thematter is, we have no idea where the poeple we have fall within the AQ org chart. This is largely because AQ is following the cell based resistance concept developed by the CIA to aid anti communist resistance fighters in the 50's and 60's.\n \n OF course, maybe we do, since under that concepot, taking out the \"upper people\" has no effect, since they really have no power and have no names or logistical information to provide, since all such information is compartmentalized.\n \n Also, we have no idea where bin laden is. He may well be living in a hole somewhere. On the other hand, he may be living in a palace somewhere in the 87% of afghanistan that we have no control over (I would guess in the 40% that the taliban controls directly). Or, he may be in Pakistan, or Saudi arabia, or Iraq, or Washington DC for all we know, since we had a better idea about where he was before we invaded Afghanistan than we do now. There has not been a verifiable report fo a Bin Laden sighting in Afghanistan for over a year.\n \n What has bush done for BL?

The difference being that, unlike conventional military organization, in a terrorist organization no individual knows the identity or purpose of another more than one cell away. \n \n Extremist line troops, suicide bombers and such, are considered martyrs by their belief system.

That's the way most belief systems work, carrot and stick, or is that line of reasoning also blocked from your mind?",

   "LOL. That is why you'll never collect. \n \n America has a sizable Muslim populace. That in itself refutes your claim. \n\n \n LOL. No it doesn't. Many people who hate America live here.\n \n \n \nNot to mention that the majority of the 3 billion or so mulims aren't fundementalists, and therefore don't take the Koran litterally. That again refutes such idiotic claims. \n \n Also, I can't forget that many of the predominant scholars of Islam are aganist Jihad in this specific case. That again refutes your claim. \n\n \n For someone who recently said he \"despises all organised religions\", it seems strange that you're such an expert on Islam. The word \"despise\" means in part..... \"to regard as unworthy of one's notice or consideration\". (Websters)\n \n \nIt's amusing how little you know of Islam and its followers. With that level of ignorance, you're never going to collect.\n\n \n I never said a word about \"collecting\". Please read before you post.",

   "LOL. No it doesn't. Many people who hate America live here.\n\n \n Are you confusing hate with \"we can make it better?\" Your buddy VOR calls those who want to fix things bush haters and tells them to get out of the country. Merely because some see a better way doesn't mean they hate America. \n \n \n\n For someone who recently said he \"despises all organised religions\", it seems strange that you're such an expert on Islam.

(Websters)\n\n \n Fallacy: changing the direction\n Fallacy: ad homenim\n Fallacy: straw man\n \n Irrevelant as well. merely because I loathe organized religion doesn't mean I don't know about it. You're apply a ridiculous logic (and apparently one you follow)that if you dislike something you do not know about it. I don't follow that. Besides I said I dispse all organized religion, not religion itself. Therefore you claim is not only false, but in a wrong context. Also, you fail to address the problem of lack of fundementalist as well as lack of support for Jihad.  \n \n \n\n I never said a word about \"collecting\".

   "So far, we have captured/identified 104 \"foreign fighters\". Unfortunatly the Us has chosen to wage a campaign where we put the lives of our soldiers above those of the civilian population. When you kill 100,000 civilians, there is going to be backlash. Grow up and accept that. \n\n \n The 100,000 thousand figure is nothing more than an estimate, by liberal sources. And even then it calls them direct AND indirect. Fuzzy math.\n \n \n \n \nDepends. if I am looking for info on the ME, I generally look to middle eastern sources. WhenI look for russina info, I look for russian language sources. \n\n \n \n And if you were looking for information on bank robbers, you would check with the bank robbers? If you were looking for information on pedophiles, you would check with the pedophiles? I tend to not check for information with those who oppose me. They could mis-inform me, with the intent of strengthening their position.\n \n \n \n \n \nI will stand by my original ascertation. you simply are not bright enough to follow them. \n\n \n I'm not bright enough to follow your own personal re-definition of words? Almost no one else does either. \n \n \n \n \nI'm sorry, but your redition of history here is so ignorant based it is laughable.\n \n First, it was the right that did not want ot enter WWII. Roosevelty, a socialist, was all for it. HE saw it not only as a chance to help the poor people of Europe, but to redistribute weaqlth in the US economy. The right, conservatives at the time, did not think that spending hundreds of billions on a foreign war was such a hot idea. Again, you ahve allowed your neo fascist views to obscure your understanding of \"liberal\" and \"conservative\". \n\n \n Why didn't \"Roosevelty\" do it sooner then? My point wasn't so much who was for it or against it, but how much it cost us by NOT getting involved sooner. If we would have started in the 30's, it very well may have saved a LOT of lives in the 40's. By taking Saddam Hussien out now, we may very well have saved a lot of future lives, including Iraqi citizens.\n \n \nMulti trillion dollar social programs=liberal\n Trillion dollar wars to \"liberate\" other nations with no benifit to us=liberal\n fiscal responsibility=conservative\n individual freedoms=conservative\n patriot act=liberal\n \n Are you catching on? \n\n \n No. \"no benefit to us\" is a liberal talking point. I could catch on better if you could tell me more about well known people who are liberal and conservative. So far, you've intructed me that Bush is a liberal, as was FDR - so they are the same. You've also said that Clinton was a conservative. I'm wondering about some others. I take it Reagan was a liberal, according to you. How about Carter, was he a conservative? emoticon_rolleyes Was Nixon a conservative, after all there were far less soldiers in Vietnam when he left office than when he took office? Is Al Gore a conservative, he's against spending money on the war. Ted Kennedy? How about some of our radio friends? Is Rush Limbaugh a liberal? Hannity? How about Al Franken, Ed Shultz, Randi Rhodes - conservatives? I don't think your word definitions have spread too well. I'd like to see someone call Randi Rhodes a conservative to her face - I'll bet she could throw ashtrays and lamps with more deadly accuracy than Hillary Clinton!! :p Oh, by the way, is Hillary a conservative, like her husband??\n \n \n \n \nIt is a brand new situation for the US. Far from new as far as history goes. Empires have grown, stablized, then fallen into economic decline before, which is what the US is doing now. It will happen again, and a gain, and will still be happening 1000 yrs after the US is just footnote in history.\n\n \n We can agree on that, we just disagree on what the reasons are. If the Democrats would stop putting their party in front of their country, we could maybe postphone the process.",
