As citizens, we have to make sure our government doesn't XXXXX foot around for the UN (luckily, oru corrent administration isn't)\n \n the danger IS there, though. If i recall correctly, the Texas Sodomy case in the US Supreme Court had references to European laws in the decision.\n \n If the courts are not enforcing laws that are passed through the democratic legislative process, then they are not doing their job correctly.

It would also be wise to remember that a man who is willing to die for his country and liberty is most often also willing to kill for it. Just ask General Gage, another well intentioned gun-grabber, who fortunately for him escaped from this continent with his life after starting a long and costly war. A war, by the way, that we won.\n \n \n \n \n May I also suggest that you step a little lightly when you're around free Americans like us, Mr. Annan. We don't take kindly to strangers trying to tell us which of our liberties meet the approval of the so-called \"international community\" and which do not. We may one day invite you to leave for your impolite temerity. We've whipped bigger and badder enemies than your globalist rabble before and we can do it again, any time you feel froggy. MV, AL \n \n \n \n \n P.S. We'll be celebrating July 9 by going to the range and perforating more blue helmets with 5.56mm, 7.62mm, 9mm, 11.4mm & 12.7mm holes. Just to keep our skills up, of course.
