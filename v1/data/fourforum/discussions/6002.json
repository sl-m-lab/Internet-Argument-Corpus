   "Well I for one loved the book, my favorite so far. It was a bit too perdictable but the reality of the book made up for that. The first couple were more children-oriented, happy kids going to school with an imortal headmaster protecting them from an abstract evil monster. This book showed betrayal, the mortal side of Dumbledore, and the hardships that will face Harry, leaving mystery at how he will be able to turn voldemort mortal and attempt to kill him. But it's fallen into the same old script. We all know he will destroy the (can't remember the word) and have a battle with Voldemort, but will he win, will there be a twist (I still think Neville is involved somehow since he was part of the prophecy and these prophecies have a knack for turning out what you least expect), who is the mysterious guy who got the (can't think of that word again) and left a fake, and most importantly how will he accomplish the tasks set forth for him. The last couple books finished in happiness and a boring ride back home after he saved the day yet again at Hogwarts. The last one and this one were much better, they were a lot more real, and when I finished this one, I couldn't wait for the next one. It was almost like she stopped in the middle of an idea reluctantly because the book had to end somewhere. Non-stop action to the end, much forshadowing about the next book, and I'm sure the next book will pick up right where this one left off.",

They didn't add anything to the story and just seemed to add space. The other thing I didn't like was that quiditch seems to not be as exciting. It was great at how vividly she explained the quiditch matches and how much hung in the balance. This book had more description of the announcing and the quiditch sections were the boring ones instead of the exciting ones.",

   "Its interesting that you should like the book but dislike the relationships,considering the first 500 pages are about nothing but a rather poorly done Hermione/Ron 'thing'.\n \n The book sucked for tens of reasons that i'm not going to list.Suffice to say there is a painful lack of action and mystery and reading about 16 year olds going through puberty is just a little annoying.Worst since the Philsophers Stone.Really doesn't compare to the Goblet of Fire in particular.",

JK Rolwing should have just skipped the dull parts and expanded the last 5 chapter (most importnant chapters) to make it not feel like it was rushed. i also agree with you on the quiditch topic. it was kinda pathetic how Harry kept saying that he's the captin so listen to him!..like...who does tat? it's pathetic! the only part in the book that i actually enjoyed reading would be the last 5 chapters..and i absoultely loved the ending of the book! so suspenceful and unfinished...love those endings! :)",
