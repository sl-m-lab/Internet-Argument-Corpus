   "Ok, so we need health care reform. That is a mathematical fact. By 2027, 100% of our GDP will be spend on health care. That is clearly not sustainable. Health care reform is also a necessary in order to address our budgetary problems. \n \n This is another \"grown up version\" thread because I am tired of uninformed people saying stupid things like \"we dont need health care reform because free market health care is best\". What we have now is NOT free market health care. If you were unaware of that, you are not well informed enough to participate in this thread.\n \n I actually DO believe that free market health care is a good idea, so I propose the following:\n \n 1. Outlaw so called \"first dollar\" health insurance. This would actually produce \"free market\" conditions for at least basic care. This would essentially require that all health care plans be high deductible plans (say, $5000 yearly out of pocket before insurance coverage kicks in). This would not only introduce price competition to basic/primary care, it would actually give insurance companies an incentive to help keep health care costs down. Currently they literally have NO incentive to do so and, in fact, have MAJOR incentives to increase health care costs. \n \n 2. Apply RICO and anti trust laws to health care. Currently insurance companies contracts with doctors require that they charge more for appointments for uninsured people than they do for those who are insured. This is not just a special price negotiated for their members (which, IMO would be OK), they actually require that doctors charge more for the uninsured. This is, without question, price fixing and should be dealt with as such.\n \n 3. Require up front pricing for medical procedures. My own family is on a high deductible health plan. That has led to me doing some shopping around for health care. MOST places I call and ask what a particular procedure, or what some lab work will cost, can not tell me. They do not have standardized pricing and can not tell you up front what a service will cost. Frankly this is BS and should not be legal.\n \n 4. Establish a national board for pricing of pharmaceuticals. This board would be able to review pharmaceutical companies costs in development and production of a given drug which would allow them to ensure that the company is still able to market them profitably, but still provide a level of consumer protection against price gouging.\n \n 5.

A thorough investigation is thus necessary that draws on details of transparency in the running of our health care system - transparency that apparently currently does not sufficiently exist and may need to be legislated. \nAnd the answer is still all of the above. Look at the first link in my first post. If you dig around that website you'll find expenditures by category. While this may not get down to the exact transaction level detail (like what a hospital spend on food) it does give an idea about equipment purchases and things of that nature. Frankly too detailed of a picture will not solve the problem. We can't micromanage our ways out of this. In fact, that might be one reason we are in this mess!.\n \n \nFigure 1 from your link shows that only 16% of Americans are uninsured. That means that 84% are insured.

I stay firm on the belief that basic care needs to be affordable for most Americans. Preventive care is something that is apparently well worth the money invested - which is why many insurance companies offer free preventive care visits.\nThe currently insured employees of a company pay about $3,500-$4,500 for their health care insurance (ie not self insured...the company picks up the remaining 8-10k). If everyone switched to a high deductible plan than this would be reduced to near $0-$500 or so. In fact my company charges $0 for high deductible plans for employees. That's an extra $3k+ in your pocket that you can now spend on a doctor's visit that will probably not cost as much since you are paying out of pocket for it. When a car breaks down you pay the 400-500 bucks to repair it, right?\n \n You might claim that some people may not be able to afford a car repair or healthcare but chances are they are already uninsured. Furthermore, we are going to have to get over the idea that we should do everything possible to maintain health. We could all get MRI Scans each year and detect brain cancer earlier and better but at some point you put a cost benefit analysis on it. \n \n \n Finally, I want to note that with the healthcare debate you have to define goals for what you want our government to do.

What WILL happen is an interesting discussion, though, because one of the bad things Obamacare did was give health insurance companies a codified reason to work to raise health care costs. By limiting their profits to 15% of expenditures, the only way they can actually make more money is to drive up the cost of health care. \n \n \n \nNevertheless, I think there needs to be an extensive study done on the reasons for the rise in health care costs, legislating transparency on the part of doctors, clinics, hospitals and insurance companies if necessary. Only then can we truly understand why costs are rising. So far, I have seen no such extensive study and have understood that often it is due to detailed information that would be necessary for such a study not being available from medical providers and insurance companies. \n\n \n Good luck with that. We will never, ever see such a study. The medical lobby is too powerful. I also think that such a study would in large part be wasted time because I think the real answer lies in the fact that a disconnect between the consumer and the cost of services exists. The consumers do not know or care what their health care costs, so there is little or no incentive for providers to work to provide competitive pricing. \n \n If you look at things like Lasik and Plastic surgery, which insurance does not cover and people typically have to pay for themselves, the prices on those services has continued to fall. Optometry is another fair example because a lot of employers have cut their vision plans over the last decade as a cost savings measure. When I was 20 years old, it cost $265 to go to the optometrist and get my eyes checked and get fitted for contact lenses. I had it done last week at the optometrists office at the local Wal Mart and it cost me a grand total of $65. There was a sale. Nope. Not kidding. Big sign up in front of the vision center announcing a sale on contact lens fittings at the optometrists. I was chatting with the guy about it while he was doing my exam and he said he even runs coupons. When was the last time you saw a coupon for a doctors office visit?????\n \n BUT, in the real world, there is no way to study that. Theory and historical evidence would certainly support the idea that consumer price disconnect leads to unwarranted price increases, but there is no way to prove, no study that can show conclusively that THIS is the cause of higher health care costs. \n \n \nThough I agree that it would be good to have incentives for people to shop around for care, I think that basic care does need to stay cheap for most people. Many cannot afford spending over $100 per doctor's visit if they have the flu or need to get a cavity filled, so they will simply avoid the doctor as long as they can - which wouldn't make the population any healthier. Perhaps a higher co-pay that is a percentage of the doctor's costs - ex. 20% of the actual cost of the visit - might be a better option.\n\n \n What about $43? That is the average price that insurance companies pay for a basic office visit. The average cost for an uninsured person is $138. \n \n Basic care we have NOW is NOT CHEAP. People foolishly think it is because their employer, not them, is footing the bill for it in the form of insurance deductibles. The average cost of insurance (employer provided, single coverage) is $5049 a year. That is $420.75 a month. That is money out of companies payroll budgets that, instead of going to your pay check is going to pay insurance premiums. \n \n This is one of the reasons that we have trouble getting a dialog about this going in this country. Americans are NOT intelligent, complex thinkers. Most americans get their health care through their employers and think of it as a free benefit. It is anything BUT. It is a very expensive benefit, and it is coming out of the payroll budget, which is going to mean smaller checks for employees.\n \n I have also argued here in the past that we need to get the burden of health care costs off our employers backs. It is too big a disadvantage for them to remain competitive. I can say with 100% honesty that I have never in my entire professional career seen a company move jobs out of the US because of taxes. I have seen literally thousands of jobs go to india, mexico, and Korea because of health care costs. \n \n \nI agree on these points as well. Here is an interesting article published a few years ago (2004) on practices of the pharmaceutical industry and how the high costs of prescription drugs are not justified:\n The Truth About the Drug Companies by Marcia Angell | The New York Review of Books\n\n \n FANTASTIC article.

When a car breaks down you pay the 400-500 bucks to repair it, right?\n\n \n To put some concrete numbers on this, When I was running my company, my families health insurance was $1275/month. It was a good plan and I paid 100% of insurance costs for all employees. \n \n Now we buy our own insurance. The plan we have is a high deductible plan. We cover all costs up to $5000 and the insurance covers 100% over that. The total cost of that is $395 a month. \n \n I have only one problem with the plan, and that is getting pricing information from doctors, labs, and hospitals can sometimes be difficult. They prefer a system where in the end your bill is a total surprise. One good thing about the high deductible plan is that our insurance company AGGRESSIVELY negotiates discounts with providers on their preferred provider list. My doctor has said that the insurance company goes all out to get those discounts for people on their high deductible plan. \n \n This makes a great deal of financial sense for the insurance companies since every dollar they can save you is one less dollar toward breaching that $5000 deductible where they actually have to pay for something. The same goes for prescription drugs (though I buy my blood pressure medicine through Wal Marts $4 generics program). I know that when I had \"normal\" insurance, the insurance company paid anywhere from $40 to $70 for a doctors visit (GP/family medicine). With my current insurance I pay for them out of pocket, and they run from $34 to $60. \n \n \nFinally, I want to note that with the healthcare debate you have to define goals for what you want our government to do.

What goals do you and Daewoo feel are most important for congress to be looking at? \n\n \n I think their most important goal needs to be to bring market forces to bear in the health care market. \n \n I think it would likely result in a multi tiered health care system, and I see nothing wrong with that (we already have a multi tier system). You used a good example a while back related to ultrasound machines, and how the hospital you worked with had bought brand new ones and the old ones were being shipped to the UK to be used by them.

I disagree. The point of my mammogram machine story is to show what current law does. Since medicare we saw a HUGE boom in adoption of technology. Why? Because you can just bill medicare the cost and claim you are using the new better technology which requires more skills, etc and charge a higher premium for it. Everyone wins! Well, accept the customer. In reality, the machine probably detects slightly better so no one questions it. So, medicare is adopted and people adopt new technology NOT as needed but as it is developed. Is this a good thing? I don't think so.

The problem is that there are some sectors of health care, like prescription drug pricing, that I think the government SHOULD be involved in. Of course their involvement in the pricing phase is only needed because of the patent protection they give, but that does not seem likely to change any time soon. \n \n Health care essentially exists outside of standard economic models (and WAY outside them in the US). I do think there needs to be some regulation there. I dont know that it necessarily needs to be specific to health care. Laws against price fixing, for example, already exist. It would just be a question of application. I also think that first dollar medical insurance causes MAJOR price distortions that are detrimental to the consumer and frankly I see that as a perfect place for the government to step in and regulate something out of existence. I think they would be justified to do so and it would actually be constitutional for them to do so. There is no such thing as a \"small\" health insurance company. Sure, they chop themselves up and register at the state level for liability purposes, but Blue Cross is Blue Cross. I dont care if they have registered an offshoot as an LLC in KS. They are still part of the giant trust that is blue cross. \n \n Personally, I would not object to some kind of medical aid program at the state level. In my own state I would certainly support it.

Theory and historical evidence would certainly support the idea that consumer price disconnect leads to unwarranted price increases, but there is no way to prove, no study that can show conclusively that THIS is the cause of higher health care costs.\n\n I can certainly understand the advantage of competitive pricing when customers do make decisions based on cost, and do understand that this is lacking in our current system. My main concern is that spending on necessary health care by consumers doesn't follow the same competitive methodology as un-necessary health care spending (such as the Lasik and plastic surgery that you mentioned). The great majority of the time when patients go to a doctor's office, it is because of some level of emergency - ranging from the flu to a heart attack. During such emergencies, they are not in the position to say \"Stop, don't work on me until I compare your prices to the hospital that you compete with\". They will also not look into such prices until they have to. Mainly, they will go to the nearest doctor or hospital available. \n \n I would agree that with elective medical care (such as plastic surgery) and with longer term care (ex. which dialisis center to go to), there is time to decide. That is not really the case with various levels of emergency care.\n \n How do you envision competitive pricing to work in various levels of emergency situations? \n \n Health care, food and shelter are necessary expenditures. Whenever there is a necessary expenditure that gets way out of affordability range, for reasons purely related to profit, and market forces do not correct it (due mainly to the necessity of the product), I generally advocate governement intervention. Market forces generally work best for products that people want but do not desperately need. \n \nWhat about $43? That is the average price that insurance companies pay for a basic office visit. The average cost for an uninsured person is $138. \n \n Basic care we have NOW is NOT CHEAP. People foolishly think it is because their employer, not them, is footing the bill for it in the form of insurance deductibles. The average cost of insurance (employer provided, single coverage) is $5049 a year. That is $420.75 a month. That is money out of companies payroll budgets that, instead of going to your pay check is going to pay insurance premiums. \n \n This is one of the reasons that we have trouble getting a dialog about this going in this country. Americans are NOT intelligent, complex thinkers. Most americans get their health care through their employers and think of it as a free benefit. It is anything BUT. It is a very expensive benefit, and it is coming out of the payroll budget, which is going to mean smaller checks for employees.\n \n I have also argued here in the past that we need to get the burden of health care costs off our employers backs. It is too big a disadvantage for them to remain competitive. I can say with 100% honesty that I have never in my entire professional career seen a company move jobs out of the US because of taxes. I have seen literally thousands of jobs go to india, mexico, and Korea because of health care costs.\n\n My main concern about moving it away from employers would be that the financial disparity in the US would grow even wider as the poor and middle class would have even less discretionary income due to having to shoulder the medical costs. Yes, if employers would no longer have to subsidize health insurance, then many would increase employees salaries an equal amount but this would mainly happen in those industries (rare nowadays) which need to strongly compete for employees. Most companies would pocket a lot of the saved costs and perhaps only increase employees salaries slightly if at all. The net result is that the poor and middle class would then have to shoulder most of the burden of their health care costs directly instead of having that employer subsidy. I do not see that as a possitive development in our country. The middle class is insecure enough as it is. \n \n I would personally prefer some government involvment in keeping costs down but voters would have to be savy enough about the issues involved and active enough in having that determine their voting paterns. Otherwise, politicians will not budge to seriously threaten industry profits.\n \n I personally would think that there is merit in a national health care system since the poor and lower middle class do end up being subsidized in their health care by those of higher income (of which I include myself as having a <$100k salary). However, as with the full analysis of reasons for growth in health care costs, I haven't seen an extensive, thoroughly researched comparison of the two systems (private vs national health care) - mostly just anecdotal comparisons which are nearly useless.\n \nFANTASTIC article. If we could get people to read it. Unfortunately for a large portion of the population, the old \"R&D costs\" sound bite is just too deeply ingrained.\n\n It makes me wonder if the main stream media is also too afraid of the money and lawyers of the pharmaceutical industry to take it on properly. The only way we have left is to spread the word in forums such as this.\n \n One thing I noticed in the article that caught my attention regarding competitive pricing is that many insurance companies have patients pay various co-pays depending on the level of drug - no copay for generic drugs, medium copay for standard, larger for more delux drugs.

That is not really the case with various levels of emergency care.\n \n How do you envision competitive pricing to work in various levels of emergency situations? \n\n \n Emergency medical care makes up slightly less than 5% of our health care costs now, and roughly half of our \"emergency medical care\" is only an emergency because people have let things go for so long that it is life threatening and the ER cannot turn them down. \n \n Lets say for a moment, though, that we did feel compelled to \"do something\" about emergency care costs. You cold regulate them. You could allow insurance companies to cover them. Keeping in mind that we are not talking about eliminating insurance here but rather eliminating first dollar coverage, essentially converting every health insurance plan into a high deductible plan, which usually has a $5000 yearly total care cost cap, I would be comfortable just hoping it turns out OK. IF you are so poor that you cannot come up with a livable way to pay $5000 back to a hospital on a long term repayment plan, you should probably go chapter 11 anyway. \n \n \nHealth care, food and shelter are necessary expenditures. Whenever there is a necessary expenditure that gets way out of affordability range, for reasons purely related to profit, and market forces do not correct it (due mainly to the necessity of the product), I generally advocate governement intervention. Market forces generally work best for products that people want but do not desperately need. \n\n \n But have you ever heard of any kind of program that provides first dollar coverage for housing and food? Everybody would live in a mansion and eat crab legs and prime rib for every meal. Why not if somebody else is paying the bill?? \n \n \nMy main concern about moving it away from employers would be that the financial disparity in the US would grow even wider as the poor and middle class would have even less discretionary income due to having to shoulder the medical costs.

I simply think we need to do it in a way that ensures that market forces can be applied to health care costs. \n \n For the most part, I thought George Bush was a complete and utter imbecile. The guy screwed up everything he touched and did almost nothing right in his entire presidency. He got HSA's and high deductible health plans right...mostly. Lets say that we outlaw first dollar medical coverage BUT give companies some kind of benefit for funding, or matching contributions to, HSAs for their employees? I think we would have to go one step further and severely limit what those accounts can be used for but it would essentially assure that people have the money to meet their deductible and cover their basic health care costs (especially with the lower costs they can expect with insurance companies actually working to LOWER health care costs instead of raising them). \n \n \nIt makes me wonder if the main stream media is also too afraid of the money and lawyers of the pharmaceutical industry to take it on properly.

You still have the uninsured getting completely and totally screwed. \n \n I would not necessarily be opposed to national health care IF we could afford it, and IF we coudl actually do it. In the long run it would probably save us money on a national level, but the transition would be EXTREMELY expensive and we simply do not have the money to pay for it.",

   "That said, I think that focusing in medicare is likely to end with heartbreak when we realize that government agency that is constantly strong arming doctors and hospitals for lower rates is probably not the cause of run away cost increases. \nHonestly, from my talks with CEO's of Hospitals (granted that is not ALL health expenditures) they kind of build this in. Let's say you want $500 for an MRI for the old machine. You tell the government it costs $750 and they come back and say \"no, only $500\" and the hospital wins and the governments feels like they won. When the new machines come out they simply do the same thing over again. The incentive to get the new machine is basically a percentage game because you charge more for \"depreciation\" and overhead. \n \n The same game is run for research at universities. College's have to submit an application to get a certain \"overhead\" rate on research. So you send $1 on research and you get $1.50 back to cover overhead like lights, accounting, etc. The goal of colleges is to maximize that rate (generally 40-60%). I've seen TONS of these and you generally throw everything under the sun into the basket and claim it has overhead and then you come up with a rate of 52%. The government comes in there and basically just says 48% based on nothing and they work it to 50%. Honestly, there is no rhyme or reason for that 50%, it was just lower than the BS number the college came up with so the government looks \"aggressive\". That 50 cents on the dollar is unrestricted money by the way and obviously doesn't go towards paying overhead. We have tuition for that. \n \n But you might be right about some things. Perhaps the federal government's random price structure causes some to get underpaid. Or maybe worse, the health insurance companies are just less random and don't care. \n \n Either way, these is a reason for the UNIFORM price increases in health care.

Why am I not surprised???\nI doubt you were dumb enough...you were probably like me and just hoping unreasonably that they were for real when the entire time you knew what was going to happen. \n \n 100 billion is about 2% of the budget which is insulting. In Virginia our FY06 General Fund money is the same as our FY11 General Fund. Roughly a 10% drop over FY07 which was the high point. And this includes the increases due to mandatory medicare spending. If it weren't for the stimulus, tuition increases, and other NGF (non general fund) type increases our state would be F-ed and look even worse (instead the federal government is F-ed). \n \n Anyway, imagine if we had FY06 budgeted amounts with the federal government. Expenditures would be roughly 2.9 trillion compared to the 4.3 trillion it was in FY10. So in other words, the state of Virginia managed to maintain spending at FY06 levels (barely) and cut 10% from the high in FY07 while our federal government is proud that they want to cut TWO PERCENT from their all-time high which is 48% higher than FY06 where states are running?\n \n Again, insulting.",

   "Alright, I will be starting from the premise of an absolute priority of converting our society to a volitional one (or as close as possible). If you are wondering what that means check out the thread titled 'the ideal society is a volitional one' in open formal.\n \n Health care reform implies government health care reform, it is morally improper to impose regulations of any kind on private health care providers save the normal integrity regulation of \"don't lie about your products or services\".\n \n Therefore we are talking about medical treatment at the expense of tax money.\n \n As explained in the above mentioned thread all tax money is without exception morally unacceptable. No contradiction can be maintained between liberty and theft.\n \n There is no limit to how the government may get it's money besides the limit that exist on any citizen, unfortunately we are talking about a lot of reform already because the government just happens to be using a form that no citizen may, it is decreeing that it may take wealth without consent and spend it on the public good. A citizen would get arrested for the 'take wealth part'.\n \n What follows one of the principles that I would put into a moral constitution, (I am still working on it so don't ask for the whole thing)\n \n The most logical way to fund a government is via logical cost division and voluntary funding on demand.\n \n Logical cost division means a citizen must pay for what they use from the government.\n \n If a citizen for instance is only using the right to vote they need only pay an equal percentage of the cost of maintaining core administration (white house, capitol building, congress and presidential staff).\n \n Voluntary funding on demand means that citizens may pay for projects and government acts which they support. This can be essentially charity like donations or the bill establishing the project may have a contract for citizens to sign to commit their support before it is passed.\n \n With that framework in mind I may speak on health care.\n \n Whether or not any part of the current superstructure for government health care can be saved or not would be a function of how this change came about. Let us assume that no part survived and we are now tasked (by our own collective compassion) to craft a new system.\n \n First off this is not the sort of thing where uncertain or fluctuating spending is acceptable, patients must know that the system is stable to find it a viable alternative to private insurance.\n \n Second I don't want to pay for freeloaders, many people will agree with me; some won't see it that way. Therefore the system should have incorporated funding gaps between those who wish to pay just for critical care to those who cannot afford it themselves and those who wish to pay for more social coverage (competing with insurance companies for low-paying patients).\n [*]Stable funding[*]Two or more payment plans\n So I will be looking for a project bill that has some type of subscription sign up, with subscription renewals every year; ideal would be the subscription even if it isn't renewed lasts another year (two years of commitment right after signing).\n \n There would be the emergency subscribers and the welfare subscribers. Emergency subscribers pay for the core functionality of the organization, namely providing medical funds AND OR care AND OR equipment in case someone needs medical help but cannot afford or otherwise attain it themselves. (needs and the definition of can should be hammered out in the bill).\n \n Welfare subscribers would pay for extended functionality, rendering the same services but to more people, those who need help OR peace of mind a.k.a 'we got a plan if you get cancer' to people who would otherwise have a hard time getting med insurance. I would expect (it would be somewhat perverted otherwise) welfare subscribers to also pay for the same situations as emergency subscribers.\n \n If you think this is way off the chart and want to know what I would do now in the context of this society, I would advocate what I said; the minimization of all tax funded action unto their utter nullification.\n \n No matter how useful or how well run an organization is the moral concern of mass theft as it's mode of operation, especially in a country which espouses liberty is so much a priority that all other factors may be considered non-existent.\n \n I have found few who would disagree with that last paragraph so long as you provide an organization (real or imagined) which they are not willing to pay for.",

Even more so if you want to prorate your use of things like roads and infrastructure. The government would have to develop a tamper-proof mileage reader on your car and somehow come up with a way charge that. \n \n You're basically talking about increasing the cost of government with no benefit to anyone.

Morals are human constructs and are predicted by the society you are raised in.

   "Taxing is no more theft than paying for a coke from the store. It is merely a simplified way to pay for services you have received. I think right off the bat your premise is wrong. \n\n If that is so then one can simplify payment until it is immoral.\n \n You compare this to paying for a coke, than we shall complete the analogy; the store will charge whom ever it decides for a coke, whether they receive a coke or not, whether they ask for a coke or not. They will take the money from your banks and they will sell your assets to make you pay for the coke. They set the price of the coke, and that price may change depending on whether or not they think you deserve the coke. Not only will they charge you for the coke but they will also include as a consequence of merely living within shipping distance of the store a bundle of fees (all with claimed justification but none with legal limit).\n \n They will make joe pay for forty thousand cokes and receive none because joe was rumoured to be rude to sally.\n \n The store isn't happy though, the store wants to maintain a monopoly on the services it requires to be paid for whether used or not so it starts to use military force to end any ventures which try to offer coke in their area.\n \n The store however cannot be found at fault you see because it is merely simplifying paying for a coke.\n \n why keep track of who wants to trade for a coke and who doesn't?\n \n It must be kept track of because the store doesn't have a right to the money of anyone who doesn't want (or hasn't received) a coke from the store at the store's price.\n \n \nWe do elect these people. \n\n No that was a statement about the government in the imaginary volitional society.\n \n \nLet's explore your example for a minute. A citizen that wishes to have the right to vote will have to pay the cost to maintain the things you mentioned but also pay for the roads on which he drove to get to the voting booth, the police and fireman that have to respond to either an accident the way or protecting the voting booth, a military to secure that right from foreign invaders, a mail service that would get the ballots from one place to the other, the infrastructure involved in lighting the polling place, the water used at the polling place (again infrastructure), the overhead in all of that which includes but is not limited to the payroll for all the people involved in the process, the accounting to determine what money was used to pay for what, and the cost of various polling equipment pieces. \n\n So in essence you are saying that it is inefficient because we would have to pay accountants to keep track of what costs what?\n \n I would say that if we don't throw all the funding of the government into a giant lump and seek to divide it later the compartmentalized costs would be naturally calculated by the division in those elements (departments) which are spending it.\n \n \nNot only that but you have to pay for an agency to monitor you use of \"rights\" to make sure you weren't using the ones you weren't paying for.\n\n The agency that makes sure people aren't stealing is called the police.\n \n I see you wish to concentrate on such services as should and are truly public (police and emergency responders).\n \n How could you keep the police from protecting people who aren't paying for the police when the police target criminals and the very lack of criminals has already insured the safety of all?\n \n I say you don't, I would pay for police because I need them. That the job they do helps more than just me is just fine, I like to help people; but I am paying for my security.\n \n What's to stop many people to stop paying and thereby loading larger and larger percentages on those who do?\n \n Simply craft the fee to bundle what is truly a bundle, the justice system as a whole. The right to post bail, the right to a lawyer, civil litigation, and non-criminal police response may all be bundled.\n \n Perhaps the protection of rights in general (the military) should be a direct article of the constitution thereby becoming part of the basic governmental fee. (this is my personal favourite).\n \n The primary is that consent is preserved, there is nothing inherently immoral about bundling services; but it should be minimized to the greatest extent when it is realized that the very stability of society relies on near universal consent.\n \n i.e. if you offer the people as a whole an 'all or nothing' deal, you must be prepared for the possibility that many will choose nothing and you cannot force them to change their minds.\n \n I have heard it said that such would be just fine, they can go live like cavemen and the society can be just dandy without them.\n \n That attitude is one of eternal disassociation. The ultimate consequence will be hundreds of mini-nations which remain stable for a generation at most.\n \n That is setting up the precondition of a society to be that everyone in it supports all government action unanimously in every detail.\n \n Tribal chiefdom would be more stable than this.\n \n Instead a society can be constructed that allows each individual to choose and support the exact actions of government which he/she requires or desires.\n \n That attitude is one of eternal association, the ultimate consequence will be a single peaceful free nation.\n \n If socialist could mean one who supports the idea of society than I am more socialist than anyone who would refuse to live in the same society with those they disagree with on anything.\n \n Finally if mankind cannot even spend the smallest portions of their product on the protection of their own rights voluntarily it seems it does not deserve to have a peaceful society.\n \n Whether or not that is true would not change my stance. We may die as a moral society or we may live, but I would not choose to live as an immoral society.\n \n Even more so if you want to prorate your use of things like roads and infrastructure. \n \n \nThe government would have to develop a tamper-proof mileage reader on your car and somehow come up with a way charge that.\n \n Why would you pick the most practically unchallenging of all the problems that might need solving in the transition between a this society and a volitional one?\n \n Cars are already licenced, tolls are already automatically charged simply by driving through the road using EZpass.\n \n We have GPS technology and car manufacturers have already demonstrated the ability to store data securely.\n \n Further the possibility that some could cheat is hardly a game stopper, that would be like saying we can't use the Internet because there are hackers.\n \n \nYou're basically talking about increasing the cost of government with no benefit to anyone.\n\n The united states stands on an Everest of it's own ear marks and bureaucratic record keeping and you are telling me that with terabyte servers littering the landscape we can't keep track of who has agreed to pay for what?\n \n Oh the benefit was righteousness if you don't remember.\n \n \nThere is a reason our constitution is set up the way it is. We are a country united under common belief and we share the responsibility of maintaining that. One can voluntarily go to another country if they do not like it.\n\n Ah the classic 'if you don't like it get out'.\n \n My prefab response is and will be 'no I live here, the fact that this nation does not hold dominion over all the earth does not validate the violation of rights within it's borders'.\n \n \nThe problem with this is you may benefit from the program without paying for it or supporting it.\n\n We have all benefited from research from people who are long dead.\n \n This government now supports a policy of the destitute benefiting from programs which they have not paid for or paid very little compared to rich citizens and companies.\n \n Simply put paying for something in the public realm is just that, on a case by case basis the bill which describes the program/project must identify if it is public or private in it's benefits and if it cannot be private by it's nature it will not be.\n \n What is not morally acceptable is for any number of people to force the rest to pay for their idea just because their idea would benefit all.\n \n I would be willing to pay for public programs, in fact I would almost exclusively be willing be paying for public programs as I think those which are not necessarily public if possible should be privately operated.\n \n Roads are an exception, they can be privately operated (i.e. we have the tech) but no company exists with the high risk capital required to invest in a large highway system.\n \n So I would be in favour of privileged use of roads (i.e. tolls) built with government money (specific fundraising to build a road).\n \n Alternatively a government program could exist to franchise road building so that many companies can build and operate roads as retainers of the state.\n \n So let me ask you a question, would you be willing to pay for public programs?\n \nFor example you may not support a police force but you could directly benefit if they catch someone who was robbing your house prior to them making it there.\n\n Yes\n \n \nWe can shorten this entire thing to you saying no welfare programs.\n\n No, you couldn't.\n \n \nAnd while I respect the thought behind it the reality is this doesn't work.\n\n That is what they said of democracy at the end of feudal power (also before trying it).\n \n \nThe reason it doesn't work is the same reason why we need child labor laws and laws against fraud.\n\n We need laws against fraud because a fraud is someone using deception to forcefully remove the consent of the other trader thereby violating the principle of volition. i.e. it is equivalent to theft.\n \n I would be interested to hear how implementing the principle of volition (also called liberty) without contradiction will violate it.\n \n \nBasically there is benefit in helping out a few folks down on their luck for a period of time so that they may be productive in the future.\n\n I certainly think so.\n \n \nThe question is, how much time is too much and how much benefit is too much.\n\n Answering that question to everyone's satisfaction may be impossible, that does not mean no one would be willing to support programs which work properly in most cases.\n \n \nNothing, as you go for, produces disparity which produces riots. People and a country benefit from small welfare programs. \n\n I don't quite understand this, could you rephrase it?\n \n \nBut I disagree that taxing is theft. It's not even close to theft.\n\n It's a sub-category of theft, it is theft advocated by a majority in a democracy, by a senate in a republic, by a royal in a monarchy.\n \n It is theft which ideally supposed to be used to benefit the victims.\n \n None of these things however can contradict the primary definition of theft.\n \n Theft is the confiscation or removal of wealth without the consent of the owner.\n \n If you took your neighbors car; you could no more say it was not theft by showing him a document proving that the majority of the neighbor hood wants a public car, than you could by claiming that he wastes too much gas and this is for his own benefit.",

   "If that is so then one can simplify payment until it is immoral.\n \n You compare this to paying for a coke, than we shall complete the analogy; the store will charge whom ever it decides for a coke, whether they receive a coke or not, whether they ask for a coke or not. They will take the money from your banks and they will sell your assets to make you pay for the coke. They set the price of the coke, and that price may change depending on whether or not they think you deserve the coke. Not only will they charge you for the coke but they will also include as a consequence of merely living within shipping distance of the store a bundle of fees (all with claimed justification but none with legal limit).\n \n They will make joe pay for forty thousand cokes and receive none because joe was rumoured to be rude to sally.\n \n The store isn't happy though, the store wants to maintain a monopoly on the services it requires to be paid for whether used or not so it starts to use military force to end any ventures which try to offer coke in their area.\n \n The store however cannot be found at fault you see because it is merely simplifying paying for a coke.\nOnly you elect the person deciding on the price and have the option to not go in the store. Unfortunately, you failed to get the point of the analogy. YOU get benefit from what YOU pay for. Society has collectively agreed upon rules of living here and we pay for that. \n \n \n \nSo in essence you are saying that it is inefficient because we would have to pay accountants to keep track of what costs what?\nI'm saying it would be impossible to track. I understand you have no accounting background but it is already extremely difficult to price a simple product much less an entire government. Cost accounting is hard work and adapting that unseen benefits is just mind-boggling. \n \n \nThe agency that makes sure people aren't stealing is called the police.\nGreat, we get 1984 police tactics under your plan. I'm not feeling that freedom\n \n \nI see you wish to concentrate on such services as should and are truly public (police and emergency responders).\nRight, since government is \"public service\". \n \n \nSimply craft the fee to bundle what is truly a bundle, the justice system as a whole. The right to post bail, the right to a lawyer, civil litigation, and non-criminal police response may all be bundled.\nWho decides what is or isn't bundled? I can simply tell you the bundle will be everything we currently offer and you are back to square one. \n \n \ni.e. if you offer the people as a whole an 'all or nothing' deal, you must be prepared for the possibility that many will choose nothing and you cannot force them to change their minds.\nThen you have to enforce a system where they receive no benefit...like Daewoo suggested, literally build a bubble over their house. This wouldn't be a problem too long since anyone who picked this would be dead fairly immediately. \n \n your post goes on but you are basically just arguing that some services are not needed and therefore we should have a choice to pay for them. That's not the way it works and there is no way to make that work. This is why we have a representative government. If you don't want to pay for the EPA anymore than get your fellow citizens to agree and change the law. To think we can develop a system where you \"pay\" to enjoy Yellowstone national park but not Yosemite is ridiculous.

YOU get benefit from what YOU pay for. Society has collectively agreed upon rules of living here and we pay for that.\n \n I did get the point, you were trying to indicate that taxes are a trade, society gets laws and society pays for them.\n \n I illustrated that the analogy breaks down when compared to a real store (a moral trade) because society is an abstraction, stores cannot charge society for it's products only individuals. If one tried it would be brought to court and crucified.\n \n \nI'm saying it would be impossible to track. I understand you have no accounting background but it is already extremely difficult to price a simple product much less an entire government. Cost accounting is hard work and adapting that unseen benefits is just mind-boggling. \n\n Companies manage to produce cost predictions, gain investments off those predictions, and pay customers based on who bought what all the time.\n \n Is there something besides scale that makes this different?\n \n \nGreat, we get 1984 police tactics under your plan. I'm not feeling that freedom\n\n What do you mean?\n \n \nRight, since government is \"public service\". \n\n Peace and justice are certainly public products of a government in a geographical area but no one has a inherent right to government.\n \n \nWho decides what is or isn't bundled? I can simply tell you the bundle will be everything we currently offer and you are back to square one. \n\n Not quite to square one, I am stuck without the right to vote, without the right to use roads or city water.\n \n The answer to who decides what is bundled or not is the people who come up with any particular idea.\n \n I am absolutely certain that given the choice you could not bundle our government as it is without fracturing the country into at least 5 sects, each of which refused to be part of the whole bundle but instead crafted their own bundles.\n \n That is the consequence of bundling. That is why Mitsubishi doesn't force you to buy cars a neighborhood at a time all the same car, no one would choose the same car. Yet they do force you to buy all the parts in the car as an assembled whole if you want a functional car. The same applies to anyone who wants to make a new government program in a volitional society, bundle all costs which belong to the same function together, if it is well crafted idea it will gain popular support and be enacted.\n \n \nThen you have to enforce a system where they receive no benefit...like Daewoo suggested, literally build a bubble over their house.\n\n No, you wouldn't have that right much less ability.\n \n That is the exact same premise as those who wash your windshields without asking and demand money for it.\n \n You received a benefit according to them, and according to anyone; now you must pay.\n \n That is operating under the incorrect principles of trade, trade is not one person gets benefit and than is obligated to pay for it.\n \n Trade is both parties agree on a service or exchange and both parties are bound by that agreement.\n \n There can be no obligation without consent.\n \n \nyour post goes on but you are basically just arguing that some services are not needed and therefore we should have a choice to pay for them. \n\n A slight modification.\n \n It doesn't matter objectively which services are 'needed' or not, man has rights therefore anyone should have a choice to pay for everything.\n \n \nThat's not the way it works and there is no way to make that work. This is why we have a representative government.\n\n Then there is no way to establish a moral society.\n \n \nIf you don't want to pay for the EPA anymore than get your fellow citizens to agree and change the law. \n \n Don't want to pay for the coke?

The cost of developing that per \"unit\" cost PLUS the enforcement would bankrupt our country overnight.\n \n Only if you structured it incorrectly, i.e. trying to sort everything out after the fact.\n \n \nYou also clearly don't understand what a government is. It is not a business. Goods provided to you and that benefit you are not always in hand.\n\n It was you who first compared taxes to a business, I love that analogy.\n \n Comparing government to a company is a good analogy for me because it's comparing one organization to a known moral organization.\n \n I know a government even in the ideal does not meet many of the qualities of a business, it is not after profit, it uses military force. What matters though is that it must still be a moral organization.\n \n \nYou benefit from all of these. They may not be direct benefits or even benefits you want but when it exists we all benefit. Frankly, the IRS is just an idiotic one. Your whole argument only works if you have the IRS to enforce these policies. \n \n Could we go without SS and Public education?

Any suggestion here wouldn't reduce the growth of health care nor increase it. You're simply changing the government is....not the way health care is.\n\n Well as I put at the beginning of the post in which I named this idea I was assuming you meant government health care, which would mean changing the way government works is necessarily changing the way government health care would work.\n \n If you are looking for some medical breakthroughs from me, I don't really have any; I was under the impression that you were talking about reforming the way health care is paid for and rendered. You can't claim this idea is not reforming that.",
