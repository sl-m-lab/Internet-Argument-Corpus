   "http://www.tenthdimension.com/medialinks.php\n \n Watch the video, a very nice explanation of the ten dimensions proposed by String Theory. Even though I feel that I am semi-intelligent guy it still makes my mind implode trying to imagine that there could be ten dimensions. I guess that is the point though our Brains can only really imagine 3(space) or 4(time) dimensions.\n \n I know there are some very knowledgeable people on this board does anybody recommend any accessible books(or websites) written for the lay-person on the subject?\n \n Also has any of this been tested in the lab? \n \n How can we test the existence of other dimensions when we can only perceive our own?",

   "One of the major stumbling blocks to the acceptance of string theory is that it is largely, or even wholely, untestable. We will never be able to observe a \"string\", they are thought to exist below the planck length, 10^-34 metres if memory serves, and hence impossible to detect directly. The only verification of string theory will be that it manages to successfuly model observed phenomena. As to accessible works, not sure.",

This is why there are dozens of versions of string theory with numbers of dimensions ranging from six to thirteen, last time I paid attention. Until I'm given compelling reason to do otherwise, I'll continue to pay extremely little attention from a scientific point of view.",

   "I have been reading a lot on String theory recently, and a closer study dispelled some of the myths about it.\n \n See \"The fabric of the cosmos\" for a good easy read on it.\n \n 5 versions of 10 dimensional string theory were proposed, and were consistent with known data, although all of them were mathematically composed in such a way that they gave nonsense answers under particular conditions.\n \n 11-dimensional string theory unifies these 5 theories, and should be considered an advancement on them rather than an alternative. M-theory is broadly regarded in this manner, and when a physicist today talks about String theory, they are typically using it as shorthand for M-theory.\n \n As far as I am aware adding further dimensions on top of this would be akin to describing newtonian motion in 5 or 6 dimensions - viable but pointlessley complex. It is certainly possible that there are 1000 dimensions, only 99% of them don't do anything, or they all do something, but coincidentally create outcomes identical to those of an 11 dimensional universe.\n \n M-theory does appear to generate testable propositions - for example if the universe contains 10 dimensions + time, but 7 of these are very small, gravity should increase within the minute radius of these dimensions. Testing this proposition is an engineering problem. Of course, a failure to find such an affect would not refute string theory as a whole, so it can perhaps be better considered a fledgling science.\n \n A gross simplification of 10 dimensions, many of them very small. Imagine the universe we know it isn't continuous, but a grid of very small cubes, far smaller than an atom. You are a string, you fit inside one of these cubes. An atom is made of many strings, so it takes up the space of many cubes.\n \n As a string, you live inside these cubes. Each cube is like a room. In that room there are 6 doors that lead North, South, East, West, Up and Down, depending which one you take. There are also another 16 doors, that lead somewhere else, perhaps you go in one and emerge a million miles away, or right back where you started.\n \n This is a poor analogy, but I find it helps in visualising.\n \n Alternatively, perhaps the universe behaves \"like\" it were operating in 11 dimensions, though many of these dimensions don't actually \"exist\" in any real sense, in equations they simply \"represent\" the mathematical code that drives the universe.\n \n One of the most interesting questions for me is whether the behaviour of the universe at the smallest level is literally random, or whether it merely appears random because we lack the equipment to discover the causes of such behaviour. Pseudoscientific philosophers continually propose that Physics has discovered the universe's behaviour is actually, rather than apparently, random.",

   "Until I'm given compelling reason to do otherwise, I'll continue to pay extremely little attention from a scientific point of view.\n\n \n Well, they didn't invent string theory out of whole cloth. (pun intended) It arose from the belief that some sort of unifying principle that explains the fundamentals of physics should exist, and the observation that much of physics is symetrical in some way. Which is not to say I disagree with you; if it isn't testable it isn't science. I just wanted to make the point that they were totally making stuff up, they are trying to conform to reality to some degree.",
