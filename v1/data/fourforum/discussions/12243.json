   "A little story before I pose my question:\n \n It was about 10 degrees and windy (-10 if you consider the wind chill) on Martin Luther King's birthday in 2003. I had recently been convicted of DUI, and with no driver's licence, getting around was pretty tough. I wouldn't dare try and drive anyway. Bad consequences. So, knowing that Barnes and Noble was open on this holiday, and with nothing better to do on a freezing, blustery day, I walked to the bus stop.\n \n I was frozen in minutes. I waited for a half hour before a painful walk back home. Calling the city bus depot, I learned the busses weren't running for the holiday. So I broke a cardinal rule.\n \n I drove to Barnes and Noble. Pulling my waxed and polished F-150 out of the garage where it had been safely ensconsed for the previous two months, the lifted four wheel drive made easy work out of the thick snow covering the streets.\n \n Upon entring the bookstore, it was a pleasant surprise to find I had the place to myself. The smell of the resident Starbucks and the quiet solitude were comforting while gazing through the frosted windows at the brittle and harsh world outside. I roamed the stacks, browsing here and there before I made a selection, then found a comfy spot to meander through the pages of a good book.\n \n I awoke with a start. \"Must have drifted off.\", I mumbled to myself. Noticing the store was still empty, I returned my unremarkable selection back to the shelf. Deciding to call it a day, I randomly selected another on a whim, and went to the checkout.\n \n Having purchased my book, I went through the door, and as it closed, I heard a feeble voice behind me.\n \n \".....cold day to wait at the bus stop.\"\n \n I turned. I went back to find this little, tiny, frail old woman. You can see her as you read this. About four-and-a-half feet tall, stooped, light wooden cane, blue hair covered in a translucent scarf. The knee length black wool coat revealing tiny black soes beneath the hem of her flowery skirt.\n \n \"Did you say you were headed to the bus stop, ma'am?\", I asked.\n \n \"Why, yes.\", she said. \"My daughter dropped me off, but I'll just walk down to the bus stop and take it home.\"\n \n \"Today is Martin Luther King's birthday.\" I informed her. \"You'll freeze to death before the bus comes today.\"\n \n \"Thank you so much!\", she said.\n \n \n \n \n Think of the things neccessary for this to happen.\n \n 1) If I had not chosen to go to Barnes and Noble, I wouldn't have stopped her.\n \n 2) Borders was closer. Had I gone there, I wouldn't have stopped her.\n \n 3) If I had not have gotten a DUI, I would have thoughtlessly taken my truck not have cared about the bus schedule, and not have stopped her.\n \n 4) Had I not broken a cardinal rule, I wouldn't have been there to stop her.\n \n 5) Had I just picked a book and checked out, I'd not have stopped her.\n \n 6) Had I woken up a few seconds earlier, I'd not have stopped her.\n \n 7) Had I decided to purchase the boring book, I'd have checked out earlier and not have stopped her.\n \n 8) Had I not decided to purchase another book on a whim, I wouldn't have even checked out, and not have stopped her.\n \n 9) Had I not have heard that faint little voice from 50 feet away, through a closing door.....if it would have closed a second sooner, I'd not have stopped her.\n \n 10) Had I not have been the type of person that would even care if she walked through frezing cold in her tiny little black shoes, I'd not have stopped her.\n \n If any ONE of these things would have been slightly different....\n \n .....she would have walked three blocks, in -10 wind chill, to wait for who knows how long, for a bus that would never come.\n \n Now. Many of you would call this God looking out for that little old lady. Maybe she had done something in her life to warrant me, through all kinds of things to deter me, to be there at that certain moment.\n \n .......but I just think it's a mere coincidence.\n \n Now my question:\n \n Since we athiests and agnostics are so jumpy to throw the burden of \"proof of God\" in your religious faces.......\n \n \n ....why don't you ask us for \"proof of coincidence\"?\n \n I mean, we athiests always decry your lack of scientific substance to your wishy-washy claim of God's reality. How come you don't ask us why we place anything we can't explain at the feet of \"coincidence\"?\n \n After all. We're so scientific. We always ask for the science behind God. We clamor for the numbers, the tests, the EVIDENCE!\n \n When you fail to provide these tests, the data to your experiments, the PROOF, we yell \"MERE COINCIDENCE!\" at the tops of our lungs as we sneer at your unfounded faith.\n \n Well? Since we are so eager to point out your lack of proof, why don't you ask for ours?\n \n Aren't you going to ask us? Where is our proof of coincidence? After all, we're so eager to point it out. We require absolute proof that something exists. Why don't you ask us for our proof of coincidence? Don't you want to know what tests we've done? How the experiments we rely on for belief have turned out?\n \n Since we relegate all claims of God's existance to the category of \"coincidence\" because you lack proof, we obviously have proven the existance of \"coincidence\" since we obviously believe in it. Don't you want to see this proof?",

   "Dude, that's a tarded story.\n \n Here's my 100% true story that Satan kicks Gods butt.\n \n I've been driving for over 2 years on an expired license...daily.\n I've been pulled over recently 3 times by the police.\n I'm pretty hostile to the police (even though I have 3 as friends).\n I was given a speeding ticket one time and a ticket for not having my seat belt on another. And on the 3rd incident, after running 2 seperate stop signs...given a warning.\n All the police officers saw my license. My image had changed (several years older and a drastic hair cut). One even ran the sucker through his police computer as he gave me a breathalyzer test...squeeky clean! I don't drink. And none of them even noticed...or cared.\n \n But, I do break every single law I can. I don't care.\n \n As an atheist...I must surmize that the Devil (patron of all Atheists no doubt) is a nice guy and is protecting me from the cops.\n \n In the 2 years of this, I've probably had just as many or more coincidences. Usually, it's the bank teller telling me my license is expired but, often it's some convoluted story where, in the end, I've done some good deed to help another.\n All thanks to me driving on an expired license.\n \n emoticon_xgood",
