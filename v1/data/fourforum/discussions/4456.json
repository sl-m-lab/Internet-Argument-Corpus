It is a process to a conclusion. The assumptions are what one starts with. Everything, even the observable world around you, must start with assumptions. Even the idea that one plus one equals two starts with an assumption that one is representative of something. We can draw a traingle that begins with three line segments. We assume that those segments are made of an infinite number of points. A point is representative of something that must be assumed and can never be proven. It is why the concept \"any two points can make a line\" is stated as a \"postulate\" and not a law.\n \n Point being, the quiz begins with assumptions about which I do not agree. It's logic is fine, as far as I can tell. It is not the logic of the quiz I have a problem with, it is the assumptions. If one starts with \"incorrect\" assumptions one gets to the wrong conclusion. If I start with the assumption that points have dimensions and are measurable, then my triangle will look very different.",
