   "\"Testing for illegal drug use is a current issue, demanding great attention in school and in the workplace. Examine both sides of this issue - the benefits to society, as well as the individual's right to privacy. \"\n \n Arguments I have so far (from Youdebate)\n \n PRO 1\n \n The main purpose of random school drug testing is not to catch kids using drugs, it to keep them from ever using them. Once their using drugs its harder for them to break their addiction. With many employers drug testing its very important for a kid's future not to use drugs. Drug use is responsible for many crimes. Its worth the inconvenience for all our future.\n \n CON 2\n \n One of the fundamental features of our legal system is that we are presumed innocent of any wrongdoing unless and until the government proves otherwise. Random drug testing of student athletes turns this presumption on its head, telling students that we assume they are using drugs until they prove to the contrary with a urine sample.\n \n CON 3\n \n \"If school officials have reason to believe that a particular student is using drugs, they already have the power to require that student to submit to a drug test,\" said ACLU-NJ Staff Attorney David Rocah.\n \n CON 4\n \n The constitutional prohibition against \"unreasonable\" searches also embodies the principle that merely belonging to a certain group is not a sufficient reason for a search, even if many members of that group are suspected of illegal activity. Thus, for example, even if it were true that most men with long hair were drug users, the police would not be free to stop all long haired men and search them for drugs.\n \n PRO 5\n \n Peer pressure is the greatest cause of kids trying drugs. If by testing the athletes or other school leaders, we can get them to say no to drugs, it will be easier for other kids to say no.\n \n CON 6\n \n Some also argue that students who aren't doing anything wrong have nothing to fear. This ignores the fact that what they fear is not getting caught, but the loss of dignity and trust that the drug test represents. And we should all be afraid of government officials who believe that a righteous cause warrants setting aside bedrock constitutional protections. The lesson that our schools should be teaching is respect for the Constitution and for students' dignity and privacy, not a willingness to treat cherished constitutional principles as mere platitudes.\n \n Thoughts?",
