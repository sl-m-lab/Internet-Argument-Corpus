   "Leave it to newly elected Republican governor Scott Walker to take over and kill a small budget surplus by divvying out a bunch of goodies to his rich friends (shades of George Walker Bush!):\n \nhe doesn't want to share the sacrifice: even as he proclaims that Wisconsin faces a terrible fiscal crisis, he has been pushing through tax cuts that make the deficit worse. Mainly, however, he has made it clear that rather than bargaining with workers, he wants to end workers' ability to bargain. ...it's not about the budget; it's about the power. ... Mr. Walker and his backers are trying to get rid of public-sector unions .... There's a bitter irony here. The fiscal crisis in Wisconsin, as in other states, was largely caused by the increasing power of America's oligarchy. After all, it was superwealthy players, not the general public, who pushed for financial deregulation and thereby set the stage for the economic crisis of 2008-9, a crisis whose aftermath is the main reason for the current budget crunch. And now the political right is trying to exploit that very crisis, using it to remove one of the few remaining checks on oligarchic influence. \n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/21/opinion/21krugman.html\n \n Feeding the never-satisfied oligarchy by starving Americans.",
