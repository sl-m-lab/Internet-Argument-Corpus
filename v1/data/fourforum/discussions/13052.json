   "(CNN) -- A sailor accused of killing another sailor was found dead in his cell in a southern California military jail, officials said Friday. Petty Officer Jonathan Campos was found dead in the brig at the Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in San Diego, a military statement said.\n \n The cause of death was self-inflicted asphyxiation, according to the statement.\n \n Campos had been charged with murder in the June 30 shooting death of Seaman August Provost.\n \n Provost was killed while he was standing guard as a sentry for the Assault Craft Unit 5 compound at Camp Pendleton, officials said. Authorities also said Provost's body was set on fire at his guard post.\n \n Provost's family believed that he was killed partly because of his sexual orientation. However, a spokesman for Camp Pendleton, where the shooting took place, said there was no indication early in the investigation that the killing was a hate crime.\n \n Along with the murder charge, Campos was facing charges of drug use, larceny, burglary, theft, arson and unlawful handling of a deceased individual.",

   "So just my two cents on this I must admit is shocking. First, because this attack on Seaman Provost struck so close to home with my own a little over a year and a half ago. I suppose I'm a little ticked because I would have loved to see this snake before a military court of law and to have for the record that is was BECAUSE SN Provost was gay. That it was a hate crime.\n \n And to also let this murderer rot in a cell for years contemplating on the suffering and pain he has caused the family, and how much shame he has brought upon the uniform. Sadly though, our spineless double minded politicians refuse to do nothing about DADT. Obama turns a blind eye to those like Dan Choi. He even said he had no idea what he had \"promised\" to the LGBT community at a democratic fundraiser in West Hollywood. \n \n Sad thing is I was at both the day of decision rally and at the protest when Obama spoke and got to talk with Dan Choi and his experience. If DADT was repealed it may have saved both young mens lives. Training could have been implemented, something could have been done. Provost could have gone to his superiors for harassment.\n \n But no... Turn a blind eye. Hide who you are. Lie about yourself. These are the \"values\" placed upon LGBT servicemen and women in the military. It is a poison that chokes the very essence of these people. I should know I was one of them.\n \n So my fellow Gays And Lesbians lets continue to be nice. Lets continue to give our money to the Democrats in hopes they really give two shits about us, because they don't. They will promise you the world and #### in your hand the next. I'm tired of being nice. I'm tired of trying to argue my very right to exist in this world! \n \n I'm tired of trying to \"reason\" with religious zealots who are so blind and so vain they use their \"faith\" as a mouthpiece to judge and get a high off of being \"righteous\" or being better than a group of people. Being stronger. Yeah... cause we Fags and Dykes are so ####ing weak.. Were spineless. Are we?\n \n I'm tired of eating the scraps off our allies table. I'm tired of being a second class citizen. Oh and did anyone here about the Outgames in Denmark? Yeah.. opening ceremony some homophobe throws BOMBS onto the track. It doesn't matter if they were so called firecrackers or what not. Point is the guy had a backpack full of them! And the night before, three more fags are beaten on the streets for being gay at the Outgames.\n \n So everyone go door to door. Be nice. Smile. Go back in your closets and live your double lives. Hook up and just have sex and keep it quiet so the strait neighbors don't hear. Don't kiss in public, shut your mouths about so called rights. Don't hold your \"significant\" others hand either. And don't stand up in church and be quiet when you read the Family Research Council spreading lies about the Matthew Sheppard hate crimes bill, saying that if it's passed these bigots won't be able to preach the \"truth\" about how perverse, how sick, twisted, disgusting,vile, crazy,odd,#####,messed up, deviant, low, filthy,slutty, and weak we all are. Because thats all we are right? \n \n Wrong. It's time we grow a pair. It;s time we stop being complacent and contempt with these so called privileges were allowed to have. As one Republican senator said \"Were allowing them to be here in America.\" In other words, we should be lucky to be alive. Cause if it were up to some of these bigoted nazi's we'd all still be in death camps rotting. Or did you all forget that the holocaust involved us too?\n \n What? you thought the pink triangle was just a fashion statement? No.. We were burned and gassed along with the jews, the gypises, the crippled, and those that were not fit enough to be part of the perfect race.\n \n And the pink triangle was a symbol that we were cattle driven to the slaughter. But lets tolerate the hate. Let's be nice to thses people that drive stigma and lies into the general public.. I'm tired of it. We need to rise up, because rights aren't given. Their fought with blood sweat and tears. Instead of coming out quietly we gotta kick down those doors. Be who WE are. These are our lives. It;s time we start living them to the fullest before it's too late, and all our heads are bashed in or were rounded up and shot in the streets of Baghdad like our LGBT brethren are right now...",

   "What really bugged me about the \"official response\" is how they proclaimed *it's not a hate crime* BEFORE they even had a suspect.\n When they don't have ANY suspect, they DO NOT KNOW WHY the crime was committed.\n So saying *not a hate crime* is just plain stupid and indicative of the mind-set of the investigators to want to avoid the gay issue.\n \n The victim's BODY WAS BURNED.\n That isn't a normal killing. It indicates an elevated intensity of irrational emotion.\n Now, I don't know if that means it was an anti-gay hate crime, but to ignore that and to rule it out BEFORE you have any info about the assailant is just dumb.",

The family even stated they knew because of Provost's open sexual orientation. But once again just like my incident the military will deny and keep it all hush hush because they refuse to acknowledge gays exist in the service. To think the military of the nation that represents so called liberty and rights is so bigoted and indignant to even openly express sympathy or concern is sick and hypocritical.\n \n But it's ok just continue to lie about who you are, because if you are open you too may be shot and burned to death in a guard shack for being a fairy. And of course we wouldn't want these homophobic people thinking a ### is eyeing them in the shower either so just keep quiet and live your double lives... \n \n I hate to say this but I think I'd rather have Mccain as president. At least his party is honest about it's hatred and disgust with gays. With Obama it's a behind closed doors hatred. A two faced hatred. Like Brian said in ##### as folk. There's two kinds of strait people, those that hate you to your face, and those that hate you behind your back. And sadly I'm beginning to believe it.",

Yes because we have had progress from families who have gay siblings mothers, fathers etc and understand the challenges we face. And no, because we have placed our faith in elected officials to carry our banner and to fight our cause of equality which most have turned a blind eye to.\n \n I'm not judging all people based upon politicians mind you, but if these are the best and so called brightest, and the ones to be the voice of the people, then their really missing the mark in taking a stand and representing our voice.\n \n As far as screwing Americans in general I think you hit the nail on the head there. With health care reform being stopped dead by republican sharks who's pockets are lined with money from big insurance, and staunch opposition to hate crimes legislation and rights to all peoples, it's no wonder our entire country is fragmented and in such bad shape.\n \n But in all honesty we, the LGBT community are really the ones at fault. We have become complacent. Young gays and lesbians don't have the fire and zeal of activism that the older generations had. And that's because they had more to lose back then. Most don;t care, or are contempt in being second class citizens, or simply just don't think it's their fight.\n \n Well it is their fight, and sadly were losing. Sure we have made great strides, but that's because it was on the shoulders of a movement that was immersed in activism, in door to door questioning, and in motivating protests and marches. \n \n We have lost that zeal. That urge to fight, to confront, to expose. Instead were told to be quiet, or to be nice, when our opposition slanders and prints lies and misinformation. We need to wake up! And take this burden upon ourselves, elect gay people, and not rely upon the empty promises of those vultures who are out only to grab our money for their own power and influence.",
