   "Probably more than you suspect. Take a look at Bush's \"tax relief\" package from a little while ago. All it was was tax cuts for rich people. However, Bush and every repubican used the phrase \"tax relief\" whenever they talked about it. It got to the point where even those opposed to the package called it \"Bush's tax relief program\". Now, eveyone knows that relief is good, that's the definition. So you ended up with people on camera arguing against relief. The facts, of course, clearly showed that the package was idiotic. However, people don't often use facts to make up their minds, they use their guts. And their guts told them that relief is good, and anyone who is against relief must be wrong. And so the program gained popular support, despite the fact that almost no one benefited from it, and our children will be paying off the accumulating debt for years. It's all in how you phrase your stance.",

Interesting how it works, isn't it. What do you think goes into it?\n\n \n The propaganda worked on you and many others. The primary beneficiaries are those who use capital gains for purposes of income, not workers. If you bought new business equipment or such for the deduction, you fell for the underlying gimmick of appeasing the middle-class (small business owner benefits were drummed into everyone's head as media darlings) so they'd drive our transaction economy with purchases. Like most all business or political maneuvers, there's always a 'Red Herring' to refocus casual observers from primary intent. \n \n Tax cuts without a manufacturing sector capable of producing enough goods to replace lost tax revenue (tax cuts) and bring new wealth creating fresh tax revenue from expanded exports are failures, a net reduction of tax revenue in times of record deficit spending. Very clever move to secure votes, but yet another burden on our weakened fiscal condition. \n \n As Kronus points out, using one's 'gut' or emotion to make responsible decisions is a sure method of swallowing deceptive political direction. Keep in mind that national politicians, all of them regardless of political affiliation, use the cream of the crop of the advertising, public relations and statistical analysis industries. Swaying the public is basic stuff to those pros.",
