   "Ok, this is a question for all out there...christian and non-christian. The chrsitian religion follows the beliefs of the ten commandments, one of which is \"thou shalt not kill\". Now granted, many of us have never killed anyone, but I will bet we all know someone who has been to war and killed another human being. I will not go into hunting or slaughter of animals for food, I would like to stick to this particular issue. Some readers out there may have in fact been one of these people who has killed another. What is the feeling of everyone on this subject. Is it right for someone who follows a religion or set of beliefs that killing is against the will of god to kill in the name of their country? Is killing negotiable based on the good that will ultimately come from it? Is it right for someone to salute or honor a flag that many have died protecting and many have killed to preserve? Like i said, this is not solely a question for christians, as i realize that many religions follow the principle that killing is against the will of god...whatever god you follow. Where do you stand on these issues?",

It was never divided between thou shalt not kill and thou shalt not murder. And even if it is, who decides the difference between killing and murder. It is presumable to think that politics can dictate what is acceptable in the eyes of god? Sounds rather like symantics to me.",

Washing your hands is killing bacteria.\n \n Murder is illegally (excludes war, self-defense) ending a human (doesn't apply other animals, plants) life with malicious intent (not an accident).\n\n \n So killing is acceptable in the eyes of god if it is legal in the eyes of the law? WOW! I just looked it up in the bible (New King James version), and to my surprise it did say \"murder\", not \"kill\". Anyone else have an opinion? Like I said, i was always taught the commandment as \"thou shalt not kill\". Regardless of the verbage, isn't it saying that we decide what killing is justified and what is not, and that we do so based on the laws of man and not god? Does this not promote man as knowing the mind of god? I would like to point out for everyone that I am in no way passing any judgement on anyone, I mearly want to understand this issue a little more clearly. And can you define malicious intent? If I am looking at an \"enemy soldier\" through the sights of my rifle, and I pull the trigger, is that not malicious intent...this is no accident. My intent was to kill another human based on the fact that my government told me it was acceptable. I am by no means trying to be difficult, but again, to me this seems like symantics. Thank you for your opinion Crim.",

Do we call god on the \"is this war ok hotline?\" It seems arrogant to me for any mortal human to decide that killing another human is justified in the eyes of god. I guess my overall point is: How do we as humans know if it is ok to kill another and if that will be seen as justifiable by god...or is there no such thing as justifiable killing?

This actually ties into another thread by Epaphras, asking who is the ultimate authority of right and wrong.\n\n \n Sun:\n \n This is a tough question that I have often struggled with. It is murder and not killing. God himself instituted the death penalty for certain offenses. God Himself commanded wars. Personally, I believe that Jesus taught us to love our enemies. Not an easy task but possible for one in touch with Him. I know a man in his 80s who was a medic and concientious objector during wwII. He never carried a gun and was not captured. But he saw a lot of action. He is without a doubt one of the kindest most gentle men I know. He did his part in the war and cared for people. He would have killed if he had been trapped with no other way out. (or so he tells me). \n \n I believe God does not want us (those in the US in particular) to sit by and watch others in the world destroy and harm other people. I don't necessarily believe our government tells us everything but, I still believe some wars have been necessary. The war in Iraq I think was more a war about the people of Iraq than about WMD (this is what is was for me anyways). Go to the US whitehouse website. They have anecdotal information reported about how people were treated by that government. it is really overwhelming. \n \n I suppose my answer is more of a musing than an answer but in a nutshell, my opinion is we are eternal beings and that to see our lives on earth as all there is, is a very short sited perspective.",

So if your leaders decide to go to war for a reason that you think is for the better of the human race you should go if you are called upon.",
