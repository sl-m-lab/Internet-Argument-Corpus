   "PUT GUNS ON CAMPUS\n \n Mass public shootings are a horrific feature of modern life. Many of the bloodiest examples of this scourge have occurred on college campuses. Professors are particularly sensitive to this danger, say Theodore Day, a professor of finance, and Stan Liebowitz, the Ashbel Smith Professor of Economics, both at the University of Texas at Dallas, and Craig Pirrong, a professor of finance at the University of Houston. All support a bill currently pending in the Texas Legislature that would permit the concealed carrying of firearms on college and university campuses in the state by holders of concealed-handgun permits.\n \n According to the professors, any public policy involving matters of life and death should be decided only after weighing carefully the competing risks. For example, examining the relevant facts and data indicates that permitting Texas permit holders to carry weapons on college campuses would improve safety because:\n \n The best available empirical evidence shows that concealed-carry laws reduce the incidence of mass public shootings.\n \n Mass public shootings occur almost exclusively in places -- like universities -- where concealed carry is proscribed.\n \n There are numerous examples of firearms owners acting to disarm would-be mass murderers, thereby saving lives.\n \n Concealed-handgun-permit holders are overwhelmingly law-abiding individuals.\n \n If gun bans truly reduced the risk of mass public shootings, then gun-free zones would be refuges from such havoc. Sadly, the exact opposite is true. All multiple-victim public shootings in the United States with more than three fatalities have occurred where concealed handguns are prohibited. Moreover, the worst primary and secondary school shootings have occurred in Europe, despite its draconian gun laws, say the professors.\n \n Source: Theodore Day, Stan Liebowitz and Craig Pirrong, \"Put guns on campus,\" Dallas Morning News, April 23, 2009\n ",

   "Mass public shootings are non-existent to rare events around the globe, with the glaring exception of one dystopic society.\n\n \n \n Sept. 13, 2006:\n Dawson College, Montreal\n A young man opens fire outside Dawson College, a CEGEP serving about 10,000 students in downtown Montreal, and then continues the rampage inside the school. Witnesses describe seeing a tall skinny youth with a Mohawk haircut walk into the cafeteria shortly before 1 p.m. ET carrying a large gun. The shooter, Kimveer Gill, 25, lived in a borough of Laval north of Montreal. He killed himself in a confrontation with police inside the school. One woman is killed, 18-year-old Anastasia DeSousa, and 19 people are wounded, at least six critically. They range in age from 17 to 48, according to police. \n \n Sept. 1, 2004:\n School Number One, Beslan, Russia\n Chechen militants take over School Number One in Beslan, Russia, where more than 1,100 students, teachers and parents become hostages. Three days later, two explosions rock the school and Russian forces launch a chaotic rescue. In total, 333 hostages die. \n \n April 26, 2002:\n Johann Gutenberg Gymnasium, Erfurt, Germany\n A former student at Johann Gutenberg Gymnasium in Erfurt, Germany, kills 16 people before turning the gun on himself. Most of Robert Steinhauser's victims are teachers.\n \n March 13, 1996:\n Dunblane Primary School, Dunblane, Scotland\n A 43-year-old unemployed former storeowner, Thomas Hamilton, cuts the telephone lines to Dunblane Primary School in central Scotland and enters, armed with two pistols, two revolvers and more than 700 cartridges. He begins shooting in the school gymnasium, killing a teacher and 16 children many of them under the age of six. Subsequent investigation found that Hamilton had been a former Scout leader who had questioned by police several times after complaints about his behaviour around young children. The controversy surrounding the tragedy led to tighter gun controls. \n \n October 1994: \n Brockton High School, Toronto\n A student unhappy with his grades shoots two guidance counsellors at Brockton High School in Toronto. Both survive. \n \n Aug. 24, 1992: \n Concordia University, Montreal\n A professor at Concordia, Valery Fabrikant, fires on his colleagues, killing four and wounding one. \n \n Dec. 6, 1989: \n L'\u00c9cole Polytechnique, Montreal\n Marc L\u00e9pine, 25, walks into a classroom at Montreal's l'\u00c9cole Polytechnique engineering school, separates the men from the women and tells the men to leave. Then he begins shooting from a semi-automatic military weapon, shouting \"I want women\" as he roams the school's floors. L\u00e9pine kills 13 female students and a college employee, and injures 13 others before committing suicide. He had purchased a semi-automatic, a Ruger Mini-14, to carry out his assault. The ease with which he had acquired it and carried out the assault leads to the creation of pressure groups, which eventually forces the federal government to set up a national gun control registry.\n \n October 1978: \n Sturgeon Creek School, Winnipeg\n A 17-year-old student shoots and kills a 16-year-old at Sturgeon Creek Regional Secondary School in Winnipeg. \n \n Oct. 27, 1975: \n Saint Pius X School, Ottawa\n Robert Poulin, an 18-year-old militia sharpshooter, sexually attacks and kills a friend, 17-year-old Kim Rabot, then shoots six people at Saint Pius X school in Ottawa. Poulin then kills himself. One of the wounded students would die more than a month later. \n \n Russian emigrant wounds 3, kills himself in Athens school shooting\n 10 Apr, 03:07 PM \n \n A young man has opened fire at a school in Athens, Greece, wounding three people, and then shot himself in the head.\n \n The shooting was reported just before 8 a.m. local time Thursday morning in central Athens, at a training program run by the Manpower Employment Organization, news agencies said. \n \n The 19-year-old man, who was armed with two handguns and a knife, injured a fellow student and two passers-by before fatally shooting himself in the head.\n \n Russian RIA Novosti agency said the police identified the man as Dimitris Patmanidis, an ethnic Greek immigrant from Abkhazia.\n \n He reportedly left a note saying he could not stand being humiliated.\n \n After the shooting, an 18-year-old student was hospitalized in a serious condition with gunshot wounds to the chest, arms and legs, while the other two victims were out of danger, health officials said. \n \n Abkhazia is a disputed region on the Black Sea coast. Georgia considers Abkazia its territory, while Russia supports its independence and issues Russian passports to all of its residents.\n \n Hamas on Friday claimed responsibility for a gun attack which killed eight Jewish students at a Jerusalem religious school the night before. \"Hamas is responsible for the attack. \n \n The Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades will officially claim the attack at the right moment,\" a senior Hamas official in Gaza told AFP on condition of anonymity, referring to the group's armed wing. Abu Ubaida, a spokesman for Hamas' armed wing, told Al-Jazeera television the attack was \"an honor we have not claimed yet,\" but did not deny the Islamist group's involvement in the attack. \n \n During a rally of Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip, loudspeakers proclaimed Hamas was behind the attack and identified the assailant as a 20-year-old Palestinian who had worked as a driver at the school. Eight students - most of them 15 or 16 years old - were killed when a Palestinian, a resident of Occupied East Jerusalem, entered the school and sprayed automatic gunfire before being gunned down by security forces late on Thursday. \n MIdEast.RU, March, 08th 2008\n \n Dealing With Finnish School Shooting After Effects\n March 26th, 2009 by Fred Stopsky \u00b7 No Comments\n Shootings in schools attract enormous attention in the world press and frequently give the illusion that such events are common in schools. Despite the rarity of such events, they are traumatic to children, to educators and to the community in which they occur. People assume a school is a safe area and children are protected in them against the evils of society. Last September, Matti Juhani Saari, a Finnish boy, entered a vocational high school and killed nine students and a teacher as well as himself. The Kauhajoki Project has been established to work with teachers, students and the community as emotional feelings continue to impact individuals. The project emphasizes, as part of a three year effort to assist the community a focus on students and the families of dead children. A budget of one million Euros has been allocated to provide trained professionals to work with those in need of emotional support.\n \n This is an intelligent approach. It is all too often for communities to go through shock and pain and then attempt to put the event away. We lack these approaches to systematic study of what happens in a community in the aftermath of a school shooting.\n \n From the Michael Bellesiles school of research no doubt.",

   "This is a subject we all wish would never happen.\n \n   AMONG THE COPS AND THEIR INSTRUCTORS \n \"Thursday afternoon, I chaired the panel of experts discussion on deadly force issues. I had been able to assemble ten superstars of police training. [He lists them, and their credentials are indeed impressive].\n \n One of the topics that inevitably cropped up was response to mass murders in schools and other public places. Among us was Ron Borsch, instructor at the Southeast Area Law Enforcement Academy in Ohio, who has been an advocate of \"sole response\" entry into such situations by the first responding officer. Though controversial in law enforcement, his theory was validated recently by the courageous 25-year-old cop who entered a mass murder scene only a few weeks ago at an old folks home, and stopped the killing with a single bullet from his Glock .40 service pistol coolly and expertly delivered to the gunman's chest.\n \n Borsch's impromptu discussion revealed the fact that some 25% of mass murder shooting sprees he has researched were ended by armed private citizens. This led in turn to a discussion of the Israeli Model, in place since the Maalot massacre of schoolchildren decades ago, in which teachers and other school personnel were trained and discreetly armed with handguns, which has proven famously successful ever since in Israel. Across the ten-member panel AND the dozens of police instructors attending the discussion, not a single voice was raised against that concept, and many spoke enthusiastically in favor of it.\n \n Don't listen to the politically motivated figureheads. Talk to the REAL cops. They're the ones who best understand the dynamics of violence, and of protection of the innocent from evil.\"\n",
