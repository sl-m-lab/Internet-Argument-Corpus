   "I think that you mean \"entropy\". You must remember that entropy and the law of thermodynamics apply to a closed system. Also, in Empiricism or in Science there is no such thing as an \"absolute truth\" or an \"irrefutable fact\". Science is based on observation. \n \n Although there is change, there is also a state of \"steadiness\" - of equilibrium. For an electron there is a positron, for matter there is anti-matter. The statement, \"there are no absolutes\" is self-contradictory since it proposes that it is itself an absolute. Since there cannot be absolutes by the statement, it makes it paradoxical.

   "It is not a logic fallacy. It is not, and ya know why? Because it is true. Not assurting some \"I'm right and your wrong\" thing here, but think about it. I will give the other example of why it is not PARADOCIAL (note the not using of the words logic fallacy), and after that I pretty much can only answer questions. \n \n Ok. If we have a statement. A is everything, it is all, it is complete. The universe is made of little A's everywhere and the universe itself is for the hell of it, the shape of an A. Fish swim in A shapes and stars glow in A patterns. The stars are also arranged like A's. A is everything, but their is a B. the B is nothing, it is no one, it does not exsist. Yet it is their. It cannot exsist in our A universe but none the less it is their. Part of the very fabric of the universe could be B's, but not. The statement our universe is an A universe is true, but it could easily be a multi letter universe, it just so happens that B's are non-exsistent. So we can say our Universe is an Absolute A, but it can be a B as well, it is not, but it can be. The statement itself we shall say is a B, or in my previous example it would be a instant it time. If the universe has only A' in it, and someone creates a B, the statement our universe only has A' would be, but the instant creation of the B made that statement realivistic to our universe previous seconds ago. Now if A's were to interact with B's and for the heck of it form T's then we would say our universe has only A's, B's and T's in it. But then the formation of the new T could make more misfit letters. As said, B's should not exsist, only A's are here, but then, we make a B. That is, for this example the only way to get a B into this universe. We can make B's too our hearts content and then even more so, but the universe will still be an A universe. And the A's could form B's in there creation, galaxies for instance could form B's, but they do not. See emoticon_xhoho \n non-paradocial (god that hurt my head)\n \n \n P.S. the water is in the shape of an A, the atoms form A's, the sub-atomic particles form A's, the grass is in the shape of A's, everything in our universe before the B thing was A's.\n oh, ya, the above about it being right cause it was true is just a joke, not meant to actually prove the arguement.

   "Okay, I'll explain it again now - so try to take this in.\n \n A tautology is an analytic truth that is always true. It is normally independant of definitions and not reliant on them. A statement such as \"that bachelor is a man\" is a clear cut analytic truth. Its truth value is determined by the definition of a bachelor. Since, for one to be a bachelor, he must (i) be male and (ii) be unmarried. What you really missed, is the vital nature of the tautology:\n \n A -< A\n \n This statement is the same as A <-< A. That is to say, it is tautological. For the moment, let's put aside the I Am, and let's take another one that might be easier to deal with. \"-<\" is a conditional statement and, for the moment, you'll do well to just read it as an \"If... then\". Therefore, what we are saying above is, \"If A, then A\".\n \n So now, let D = Dogs are fat. \n \n D -< D\n \n What we're saying here is, \"If dogs are fat, then dogs are fat\". This is true by the rule in logic called Modus Ponens. Modus Ponens states:\n \n A -< B; A :: B\n \n We have reached the conclusion that all crows are not black by inductive methods - not deductive. If we define a crow as black, then all crows are black. That is a tautology. However, \"All crows are black or they are not black\" logically follows from the law of excluded middle. \n \n A tautology has often been defined as \"saying the same thing twice\" - which can often fit very well. It often provokes circular reasoning. You might also do well to think of it as the opposite to a paradox. While a paradox is always false, a tautology is always true. If you are having further trouble understanding the nature of a tautology, search for some truth tables on the Internet - they might make things clearer.",

   "Draconis- I have mentioned this nearly four times I think. Which thing with the \"A's\"? Your statement, in your signature, is paradoxical. And therefore - invalid. Period.\n \nIt is not paradoxial, and your If and Thens, can be disproved. Name some and there is always going to be a way to disprove them with futher If's. \n\n What? I'm sorry, but this doesn't make sense. My \"if and thens\" can be disproved. Would you like to elaborate on that? It's a simple notation used to signify a conditional statement. I can give you plenty; and I already have.\n \n Let A = \"Dogs are Dogs\"\n \n A -< A\n A <-< A\n A iff A\n \n Let B = \"This is a pen\"\n \n B -< B\n B <-< B\n B iff B\n \n I can go on. Do you want more? There is no way that you can deny that A is A. If A is not A, then the original A is not A as well. Do you see? It would be self-contradictory.",

I think I get the bottom line. You are saying that there is only one absolute and that is that there are no absolutes. The point being that is contradictory. \n \n Now if you say there is only one absolute. Then you have a reasonable logical statement. I think. Then the only absolute is that there is only one absolute. The problem with that is that it is circular logic. If the universe were always in existence then that is a statement of absolute. If the universe wasn't always in existence but came into being through another measure (ie God) then THAT would be an absolute. \n \n To say there are no absolutes is diproven in the saying of it. Even in context. Now, if one wants to say that there are few absolutes, that is arguable but not illogical.\n \n That would be more in \"the context\" of what you are claiming. I think.",
