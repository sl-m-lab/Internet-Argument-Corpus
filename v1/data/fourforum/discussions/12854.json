   "Today there was a shooting at a Holocaust memorial museum in Washington DC, one security guard was shot, the gunman was shot and taken into custody, no other casualties have been reported.\n \n Not even two hours after the incident, the Brady Bunch is already blogging about it on their website.\n \n In their usual fashion of \"never let any tragedy or accident go unexploited\" they're already blaming the NRA and congress for the shooting, claiming that it's because the handgun ban in DC was overturned and thrown away for being unconstitutional. They're trying to make it look like this could have never possibly happened just two years ago when DC could still legally ban the ownership of new handguns, as if the law was actually some magical cure for violence.\n \n Yeah right, like this 88 year old white supremacist would be saying to himself \"I hate blacks, mexicans, chinese and indians, and I want them all dead, but I'm not gonna use a gun. No, it's illegal in DC to have a gun outside your home, it'd be against the law for me to start shooting at this museum!\"\n \n The laws in DC haven't changed to the point where anybody could believe this bilge water. It's still illegal to have a gun outside of your residence, it's not like you can just freely transport it as you'd like. And DC is still enforcing its \"safe storage standards\" even though they were told it was illegal by the Supreme Court.",

His reasons had nothing to do with some Left Winged Propaganda! \n \n A possible way the Left could be culpable, would be if you accomplish disarming our nation, allowing a low life to get guns from their drug dealers who imported them in with their drugs, and leaving We the People defenseless from these vicious predators. \n \n Other than that, there is pure and unadulterated evil in this world. People have moral choices to make, that has nothing to do with you or me! Nothing! However, people who commit these heinous acts are usually far beyond reach of societies peer pressures any way.

   "Story said he walked to the door with it and the guard opened the door. Obviously he had it/them whether or not (it) was illegal which made no difference and is proof gun control laws are a failure\n\n \n I'm not taking a position in the gun control debate overall. I support the Second Amendment with reasonable regulations. But I'm not familiar with the details enough, one way or the other.\n \n I understand he had a criminal record related to being chased by a security guard on another occasion because he'd brought a sawed off shotgun into a public building.\n \n So I am wondering where the weak link in the chain is, since I understand he would not be allowed to own a gun after such a incident. How did he come to acquire the gun he used?\n \n That's basically all I'm asking.\n \n \n \nIs there an echo in here? That is what I stated and added that it shoule be the RULE and not the exception. Maybe your point is that it is all right for civilian police officers to use force but not civilians in different clothes? When the DOD starts paying LE and they operated under the Geneva Convention and follow military orders then you can use a different term than civilian to describe them. The metal detector didn't have anything to do with it, from what I read, he carried it openly and SHOT the guard at the metal detector. My point was and is that the perp should be shot by armed citizens which is the point you missed. Whether it is a LEO or another armed citizen it should be the RULE and not the EXCEPTION.\n\n \n Well, I don't agree with you there. It was a national museum on the National Mall where thousands of people visit daily, including families and school trips with children and teachers. It is near the Capitol and the White House. People should not be able to walk around with guns.\n \n If you're in your home and someone breaks in, that's a different story.\n \n \nI am not answering for Mr. Tither but maybe he will not mind if I point out the Palistinians and any other group over there are all Semetic including those who practice Islam.

It's terrible the other security guard was killed. I have no objection to the security guards being armed, though I'm sad that we live in a society where this appears to be necessary. Likely the security at all of the museums at the National Mall, now, is going to beefed up even higher. \n \n \nInstead the real story is that, Guns do save lives!\n\n \n I agree with that too. Though I think we're gun obsessed in our culture, and a lot of times, we can defend ourselves more effectively without guns. Still, in spite of problems, I don't think the answer is to abolish the Second Amendment. We do have the right to arm ourselves individually as Americans, within reasonable parameters. And essentially, keeping some of the safety issues specific to guns in mind, I see a gun as a tool that people are capable of handling intelligently, like other tools.

I support the Second Amendment with reasonable regulations.\n\n \n Oh?\n \n And just what \"reasonable regulations\" is it that you're referring to here?\n \n \nI understand he had a criminal record related to being chased by a security guard on another occasion because he'd brought a sawed off shotgun into a public building.\n\n \n I heard it was due to going into a bank with a gun and a mock bomb to protest the state of the economy and the government's (in)action at the time.\n \n \nSo I am wondering where the weak link in the chain is, since I understand he would not be allowed to own a gun after such a incident. How did he come to acquire the gun he used?\n\n \n Obviously not through any legal avenues. And obviously the various anti-American laws of DC didn't do anything to make him halt either. So the Brady Bunch needs to shut the **** up about \"weakening gun laws and putting everyone in danger\".\n \n \nWell, I don't agree with you there. It was a national museum on the National Mall where thousands of people visit daily, including families and school trips with children and teachers. It is near the Capitol and the White House.\n\n \n So what? What's that got to do with anything?\n \n \nPeople should not be able to walk around with guns.\n\n \n People weren't able to walk around with guns at the museum, it didn't seem to do anybody any good.\n \n Regardless of the location of a public mass murder scene, the people who were killed were always killed in a location where they couldn't carry a gun for their own protection, but the killer got to regardless of the laws and the posted signs and warnings. And to me that just doesn't seem fair.\n \n Why we continue to tolerate such a state of affairs baffles the mind.\n \n Is it possible that those in charge of claiming its actually safer when the deranged lunatic is armed, that somehow the bad guy having an exclusive monopoly on force will somehow lead to fewer people killed?\n \n I mean afterall it's not like the sociopathic killer or the white supremacist is going to just kill a few people and then stop because he sees they're unarmed, but be driven into a blind rage if even one person is armed and feel compelled to kill many more people that he originally intended. You'd have to really be stupid to believe that.\n \n I thought we didn't believe in the \"sacrifice one to save many\" mentality.\n \n \nIf you're in your home and someone breaks in, that's a different story.\n\n \n Doesn't our right to protect ourselves extend beyond the private property line? We have people robbed, raped and killed in parking lots, public parks, supermarkets and every other public location, and it's happening far too often for me to be comfortable with. And I don't think it's right that our rights are supposedly somehow suspended once we leave our yard and step onto the sidewalk or drive down the street.\n \n What good is having rights that people in other countries don't, if they don't apply to a public setting?\n \n \nAnd, I think it's quite reasonable and appropriate, whether right-wing or left-wing, to call them \"wacko\", if they open fire in the National Holocaust Museum.\n\n \n What about the wackos that were responsible for WACO and Ruby Ridge?",

I haven't seen any. If you've got any I'd like to see it.\n \n \nBut not if you unnecessarily take the law into your own hands.\n\n \n Excuse me?

Only about 38% of their shots ever find the intended targets, with the other 62% being rogue and going off in undesirable directions.\n \n http://www.theppsc.org/Staff_Views/Aveni/OIS.pdf\n \n Check page 7 and see for yourself.
