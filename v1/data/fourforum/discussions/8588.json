   "Just for informational purposes, here is a summary of the legal reasoning behind permitting the police to lie to suspects during interrogations. \n \n The Constitution requires that all confessions be voluntarily made. If a statement is proven to have been involuntarily made (made while being tortured, to give an extreme example), then the Court would apply the exclusionary rule and suppress the statement. \n \n Lying to suspects is not encouraged by the courts. When it happens, however, it does not automatically require suppression of a confession. It becomes merely one factor to consider when a Court decides whether a \"confession\" was freely and voluntarily made as opposed to being the product of coercion. Here are two quotes from a Virginia case which give a good explanation of this reasoning:\n \n 1. The voluntariness requirement. \n \n \"The test for voluntariness derives from federal constitutional law relating to the Fifth Amendment as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. In Stockton, we relied upon Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 225 (1973), and concluded that in order to determine whether a statement is voluntary, we must decide, in light of the totality of the circumstances, whether the statement is the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker, or whether the maker's will has been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired. 227 Va. at 140, 314 S.E.2d at 381.\"\n \n Rodgers v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 605, 609, 318 S.E.2d 298, ___ (1984)\n \n 2. How lying to suspects fits in the totality of the circumstances:\n \n \"Even a lie on the part of an interrogating police officer does not, in and of itself, require a finding that a resulting confession was involuntary. In Frazier v. Cupp, 394 U.S. 731 (1969), the Supreme Court made clear that even an outright falsehood by a police interrogator is but another factor to be considered in evaluating the totality of the circumstances. In Frazier the officer told the defendant that one of the defendant's friends had confessed. This was false. The defendant, after some further hesitation, confessed. He argued that the falsehood rendered his confession involuntary. Justice Marshall, writing for the Court, rejected that argument:\n \n The fact that the police misrepresented the statements that Rawls had made is, while relevant, insufficient in our view to make this otherwise voluntary confession inadmissible. These cases must be decided by viewing the \"totality of the circumstances,\" see, e.g., Clewis v. Texas, 386 U.S. 707, 708 (1967), and on the facts of this case we can find no error in the admission of petitioner's confession.\n \n 394 U.S. at 739.\"\n \n Rodgers v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 605, 616, 318 S.E.2d 298, ___ (1984)",

Suppose after 120 hrs of being deprived of sleep the suspect confesses and only the confession is recorded? Suppose the suspect was offered a perk - like being allowed to sleep, have a drink of water, go to the bathroom etc if he confessed. Law enforcement may need every tool it can come up with but some such tools do not lead to justice and justice should be the goal, not just clearing cases quickly!\n \n Again you and others should read Grishams book to see just how far law enforcement can go in lying to suspects - such as misleading them as to their rights, such as misleading them to their legal status etc. A lie such as you use as an example is probably innocuous - most people would not confess on the basis of such information (although some innocent ones might under some circumstances). The book is a nice example of what happens if one gives law enforcement carte blanche to elicit false confessions by various manipulations. Read and enjoy;.",
