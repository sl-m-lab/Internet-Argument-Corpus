It is true that Christians are the biggest opposers to gay rights, particularly marriage and schooling. But your tactic may seem satisfactory to you, while in reality it's ineffective. \n \n \n I totally disagree here, Unkerpaulie. Bashing professing Christians is actually a quite effective tool indeed; but not for the gay folks. This entire 'Gay Rights' propaganda movement is riddled with flaws of every sort. Their agenda is directed at what they perceive as a 'secular America,' when in actuality it is dominated by a majority of professing Christians. That one obstacle is more than all of their efforts combined can overcome. They believe that being 'gay' is like being a woman or black person from our history; a group seeking God given rights. \n \n Gay folks wish to duplicate the efforts of the leaders who brought attention to 'minority rights' for those groups, as if they do not possess the same rights of the rest of us already. Fortunately for common sense, these people do not represent an oppressed sex (like women), or any race (like people of color). Therefore, this pity party for the gay folks is not well received by most of America today. The 'in your face' dynamic from many of them is simply distasteful to most of professing Christianity. \n \n \nUnkerpaulie << the way to get the legal system to consider your case is to lobby, demonstrate and petition, and it helps if you have contacts in high places. Attacking the Christian community doesn't do any of that.\n\n \n Shhhhhh . . . That is what we are here for. In the end, the gay movement in this country will become a victim of their own success. So let them have a little. They wave banners about marriages in Massachusetts like there is no tomorrow. They are exposing loopholes in the law and take one step forward. But the sleeping giant represented by all the professing Christians in this great land is being stirred and motivated into action. Lobby congress? Are you kidding? Those are duly elected representatives of the very Christians and employers these people seek to attack! \n \n No sir . . . let them bark like animals at professing Christians; blame employers and everyone else for not handing them special rights. We need that kind of negative activity from their side to gain enough support in congress for the US Constitutional Amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman. They are providing us with the ammunition for our guns. \n \n America needs to become aware of the actual costs of raising civil unions to the status of legal marriage. Insurance and retirement premiums will be raised upon everyone to accommodate the millions of people who will get 'hitched' just for the money. Instead of pension benefits going strictly to married couples, those programs would be changed to allow for any and all kinds of same sex union scenarios. \n \n How would American companies compete in a global market, when our prices must reflect all of these costly added benefits? So, even the non-Christian employers are forced to side with the Christian majority on this issue. If marriage is no longer the holy union of one man and one woman, then where does it end? This is simply a Pandora's Box that none of our government representatives are willing to crack open, as our posterity would continue to pay for it forever. \n \n \nUnkerPaulie << In fact, you are doing nothing but attempting to fuel more gay vs religion feuds.\n\n \n Attempting? Careful inspection of the gay views expressed in these threads will reveal that this is not about 'gay rights' at all. They are not seeking any Constitutional Amendment that says marriage is lawful between two men or two women. The gay folks posting here are doing so to justify their gay behavior. This is all about trying to equalize what is in their 'mind,' with what is in their own personal environment. Most of them cannot see past their own selfish desire. \n \n What is the motivation of the typical God-fearing Christian in the USA today? For most it is God, country, family, job, church, etc., or these things in a different order. When it all boils down, we are here for our children, and their children; our posterity. Compare that to what motivates the typical gay person. He is mad at God for making him gay, and rejecting His Word, because it says they are 'worthy of death.' They are mad at our country and leaders for denying them theses 'gay rights,' as if they are not already privileged as \"We The People.\" The hard core, real deal, gay folks out there do not reproduce in nature. So they have no posterity. All of their new members must come from heterosexuals. \n \n Every living homosexual male and female was born to heterosexual parents, and were born heterosexual themselves. So to them, their enemies are everywhere, even in their own families! Add to that the fact that a professing homosexual male or female out there is one experience from returning to his heterosexual ways. Every time one gay person decides to start raising a family, then they lose another member from their 'gay rights' movement. This feeds the argument that being gay is a choice, because every day people decide not to be gay anymore. So again, let's allow them all the rope they need to tie the best knot possible.
