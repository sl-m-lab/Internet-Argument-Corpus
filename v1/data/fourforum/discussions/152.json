   "It is easy to understand the logic behind the bill. It remains ridiculous to find the manufacturer liable for the acts committed by those who might purchase their products. Suing the gun manufacturer for a defective product, when the product performs as designed is absurd. This is simply another attempt to minimize the personal responsibility of the American population. Creating a society, where all responsibility rest in the government, will undoubtedly reduce those rights and personal freedoms we enjoy. By creating a predator/prey system that only the government can combat, as gun ownership becomes impossible, more and more police services will be needed. As the problem persists, it is easy to justify a police state, in order to care for a population whose right to self defense has been infringed.\n \n Yes, the agenda is quite clear. Let me put it into perspective. Let me compare past results, with the possible future of a nation that risks being disarmed. Let me ask an important question and have you evaluate which ideal state seems safer.\n \n Which system would you rather have; a system where the public is armed, and gun deaths occur in a random fashion, at a low percentage of the population, or a system where the police and military are the only sector of the population allowed access to weaponry? In the latter system, the police and military usually merged into one entity. Other civil rights enjoyed by the population can be effectively reduced, since no forcible opposition is able to exist. Finally, gun violence occurs at an alarming rate, as mass graves are filled with those who represent potential opposition to a corrupt regime. History provides ample evidence for all the characteristics of a system that finds itself disarmed.\n \n I know that the prospect for peace and tranquillity remains a tempting offer by those who vocalize an anti-gun stance, but I ask you this. Do the premises match the conclusion? Will the elimination of your rights to own guns, or the gun manufacturer's rights to produce guns, make you safer in any way? The answer is no. Criminals will continue to break the laws by using previously existing guns. As a law-abiding citizen you will not have the right to self-defense. Therefore, murder and mayhem will reign. Military and police can then form a strong public interest to advance the powers that they hold. A bloody coupe could succeed in replacing the last remnants of democracy in America. Finally, those who resist such an illegitimate act could be rounded up and shot, without any viable resistance.\n \n Ask yourself; do you support the constitution, or are you an enemy of its design? Only those who hate the outline of America's political system would condone such a ridiculous attack on the gun industry. Those who tell you that the second amendment was designed so hunters could hunt, not for the purpose of providing a final system of checks and balances to impeded the natural flow of government towards tyranny. These people are the same liberals who defend our enemies. These are the same people who march in opposition to the war in Iraq. Their purposes are becoming more and more obvious, as they align themselves with our true enemies. They are the fifth column, and represent a domestic threat to the U.S. political system. Do you really want to advance their cause by supporting just one of their harebrained ideas?",

   "I do not think they should be immune from them but I believe that in the cases where they are sued and win that the plantiff should have to cover any cost incountered by the defendant becuase of the lawsuit in other words LOSER PAYS. This would stop alot of wreckless lawsuits by making them expensive if you loose, so that you would not feel to good about filing one if it was not sure to win. The BATF does not suggest that gun manufactures try to find out what dealers are selling them illeagly as this would interfere with and possibly obstruct the investigation launched by the BATF or other Gov't agencies. So what are the manufacturers supposed to do? I say that if you sue them becuase they made a product and a criminal used against you or you were stupid and shot yourself then you (or the criminal) are the only ones responcible.",
