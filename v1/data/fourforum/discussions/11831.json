No substance...\n \n The only thing you change is how you tell the lie, but even that is sounding familiar...\n You refuse to cite your sources.\n I will cite sources in refuting your repetitive claims.\n \n However, as Media Matters for America has noted, an analysis of the candidates' tax plans by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center (TPC) found that \"Senator Obama offers much larger tax breaks to low- and middle-income taxpayers\" than Sen. John McCain. According to Obama's Tax Fairness Plan, he \"will provide $80-85 billion in tax relief to America's workers, seniors, and homeowners.\" Obama's proposed tax cuts include \"a new 'Making Work Pay' tax credit of up to $500 per person, or $1,000 per working family,\" a \"universal mortgage credit\" which \"will provide the average recipient with approximately $500 per year in tax savings,\" and the \"eliminat[ion]\" of \"all income taxation of seniors making less than $50,000 per year.\"\n \n According to the TPC analysis, under Obama's tax proposals, tax filers in the middle quintile -- those earning between $37,595-$66,354 annually -- would receive an average tax cut of $1,042 in 2009 and an average tax cut of $2,136 in 2012. TPC further noted that those figures represent \"an average cut equal to 2.4 percent of income\" in 2009 and \"an average tax cut equal to 4.6 percent of income\" in 2012.\n Media Matters - Hannity falsely claimed Obama tax plan would raise taxes on \"families of four that make $50,000 a year\"",

Along will come the steadily growing lines of unemployed people holding their hands out for the re-distributed wealth that Obama will need to steal from the successful big companies (small businesses will disappear) in order to provide subsistence for the unemployed.

You clearly are hearing the music but ignoring the words - what have people up in arms now - if you actually want to be informed on current event outside the Kool Aid Channel, on the plumber gaffe tape... Obama is clarifying who gets taxed. He is taxing revenues of those making $250k or more - which is devolved down to $150k in a weeks time. It came out of his mouth! REVENUES are getting taxed, DO YOU KNOW WTHAT THAT MEANS? I dont' think you do! Undefined... revenues is every penny generated. Not a specifically targeted loop-hole or some abstract line item on the tax code that get splugged. This is serious business because small business will not get a break because he didn't define anything. In case this hasn't sunk in yet... revenues encompass everything generating income, his tax plan is smoke and mirrors and will kill our economy.\n \n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, increased government health care will reduce health care burdens on firms that are least able to afford it.\n \n \n Another ideal that has been put down by reality. I doubt you remember the ill fated Tenncare attempt at socialized medicine. The Governor of Tennessee who was a die hard Clintonista, fas-tracked a health care program that was so disastrous, doctors simply defied the system to not accept. It went broke so quick they are still mopping it up today. The illogic of the state paying for health care when it didn't:\n \n 1) Bring you into the world\n 2) Put the food into your that is no doubt not the best for you\n 3) Live high risk lifestyles that would inherently be more costly to others... \n for you \"fairnessmongers\" where is the fairness in that?\n \n Simply put, socialized health care for a system like we have hear with the neolithic inefficiency of government has proven itself to be a perpetually bad idea. There is nothing the state can propose to spend that the private sector cannot address successfully given the impetuous to do so.\n \n Kevin, M.D. - Medical Weblog: Socialized medicine is not the cure\n \n \n \nTrue, there will be abuse, aka Wal Mart, but it's not what you say it is. \n\n \n May I remind you of the $149 hammer - sorry, it won't work, it's too risky.\n \n \nFurthermore, the US has been practicing forms of Socialism for decades.\n\n \n Not really, but the entitlements you refer to where by-in-large introduced by neo-socialist democrats during the pre WWII era, with the New Deal, I am so glad hisorty has seen that for what it was, if not for the war... we'd have been done.\n \n \n The Police, military, firefighters, schools and highway systems are all forms of Socialism. \n\n \n I don't know what revisionist civics class you took, but infrastructure has never been known as \"socialist\".

One thing is evident.. you should never open your mouth supporting evolution. That fact that you don't know that mutations cannot ascend, and information for one thing cannot \"become\" information for another... is evidence enough for me that you need to stick to the drawing.. you'd have greater success with art students. You need to go somewhere and take your dumb XXX and move on, it is glarigly obvious you have no friggin clue what you are talking about.\n \n \n \n \nYour ignorance is astounding.

Why are those Brits and French, and Swede's who can afford to get here... coming here for health care?

It failed, fail is fail... it means didn't' work, ain't gonna work. Busted, kaput! They all have the same elements which means they all have the same ability to fail just as quickly that wasn't a justification to dismiss the fact that you feel it would work. It means under any circumstances - socialism in a capitalist system doesn't work, because if we don't have the money, how in the world is a socialist democracy gonna have it - you have failed to refute what history have already bore out, who are Stuperman?\n \n Besides, you have failed to actually address what I wrote: how it effects the burden on business. \n \n I apologize... maybe I didn't see that in what I read.\n \n Over taxation on an already overtaxed business infrastructure means less people to be taxes because small business employs the most people. American has the second highest commercial tax bracket in the world - further burdens will cause it's demise. It is simple math, fewer people working means smaller work pool to tax... too much tax burden on the existing tax base means... she's gonna blow.

How the hell is chance what you say it is?\n\n \n You aren't in a position to call anybody out... I know what I am talking about, but you clearly haven't even read the authors of the pseudo-science you'd draw blood at a coffeehouse to defend... provided it was in the course of a glass dropping. Anyway... Huxley, Crick and a few others [more recently] have admitted that the whole argument of evolutions credibility rests with chance. Millions upon millions of years for chance to be the agent for mutations to take place... and for adaptations to come from those. The notion alone is illogical to the core - It flies in the face of the laws of thermodynamics... and simply cannot happen which is why so many secular scientists are looking closer at intelligent design - this is them, not me... them. In fact there is so much info out there regarding cange being the agency for evolutions... google supplies too much, I wouldn't beging to know where to start, it's the basis of the theory, yup.. a gamble, don't you feel good you are the product [in your mind] of a super elastic bubble plastic gamble in space?
