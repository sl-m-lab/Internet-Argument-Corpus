   "So in the last few weeks I have seen the stock market go up because of \"better than expected economic data\" or \"speculation that so and so will help the economy\" or my favorite \"changes in mark to market will cause banks to have higher profits\".\n \n So from what I gather, and correct me if I am wrong, there really aren't any hard numbers to support an economic turnaround right now but people are just saying things are better in a hopes that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. \n \n First off, changing mark to market doesn't increase profits in the true sense of the word. All it does is change an accounting rule...the company isn't any better. What a fraud the outcry for that change was.\n \n Second, when I see \"customer spending didn't go down as much as we thought it would\" that stills means it went down so how is that good news? I wonder if this works at a normal job. \"Hey boss, I'm predicting I will not get a thing done this month\"...1 month later...\"boss! I did one thing of the 100 I was supposed to do which is better than predicted so give me a raise\". \n \n Third, you can really only go down so much before there is nothing to go down to. Home prices are priced like they were in the late 90s and people have to move from time to time anyway. There is a certain level of consumer spending that has to occur for people not to starve. It seems we are close to that now so bottoming out is not a sign that things are good. We could just stay at the bottom. \n \n So where is the good news that everyone is talking about that causes stocks to go up 10%?? I certainly don't know.",

HOLMES\n Published: Thursday, September 30, 1999\n \n In a move that could help increase home ownership rates among minorities and low-income consumers, the Fannie Mae Corporation is easing the credit requirements on loans that it will purchase from banks and other lenders.\n \n The action, which will begin as a pilot program involving 24 banks in 15 markets -- including the New York metropolitan region -- will encourage those banks to extend home mortgages to individuals whose credit is generally not good enough to qualify for conventional loans. Fannie Mae officials say they hope to make it a nationwide program by next spring.\n \n Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\n \n Fannie Mae Eases Credit To Aid Mortgage Lending - The New York Times\n \n Well! Now we know. Not only that but another liberal dunce by the name of Barney Franks said there's no problem with Fannie Mae.\n \n youtube.com - July 14, 2008: (Barney Franks): \"I think this is a case where Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are fundamentally sound. They're not in danger of going under. They're not the best investment these days from a long term standpoint going back. I think they are in good shape going forward. They're in the housing market. I do think their prospects going forward are very solid. \" \n \n Barney Frank: Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae fundamentally sound",

I'm of the opinion you get no grace period anymore because we have given a 30 year grace period and it has only served to screw us. Furthermore, we don't have time to wait and see...it is either fixed now or its over.\n \n Interestingly, I was at a CPA conference the past few days in DC and a lot of the focus was on the government and the economy. They had someone from the FASAB (no not FASB) who works on the economic sustainability team. A summary of her assessment was that the baby boomers drove our fiscal policy into the ground while NOT doing a thing to help themselves out. In turns out they get the LEAST amount of benefit from the expansion in government programs THEY enacted. I was amazed! I always assumed the Baby Boomers were being selfish instead of being stupid (or both) but it turns out they were just being stupid. In any event she went on to say that soon we will have debt at 700% of GDP but not really since you can never get that high without collapsing. To sum up: USA = in trouble.\n \n One of the other speakers was an investment banker. We talked for 45 minutes about the improvements we are seeing in our economy and how we should be excited about it. About every third sentence he would add a disclaimer saying \"well, don't get too excited because there are some indications things could get worse\" but they were almost under his breath. So after a 45min fan boy conversation on the economy he showed us his investment portfolio. It consisted of buying equities in overseas emerging markets (ie China), drop all US treasuries, invest in commodities, and by BB rated company bonds because they have the most record for the risk. In other words after a 45min US economy puff piece he basically said \"the USA is done and I'm not investing in it\". I couldn't make this up if I tried. I couldn't stop laughing! He is trying to sail away on the boat and yelling behind saying everything is going to be fine. \n \n Ha, I love it!",
