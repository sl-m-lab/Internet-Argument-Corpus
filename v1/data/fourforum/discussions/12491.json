Virtually all Americans, more than eight in 10, blame Republicans for the current economic woes, and the only two leaders with lower approval ratings than Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi are Republican leaders Mitch McConnell and John Boehner.\n\n \n That is from THIS MONTH.

Now that we have gone down this road, if it does not work, the US WILL FAIL. If we do not see substantial improvement in our economy before the inflationary impact of all the quantitative easing we have seen shows up, the dollar will crash, the government will be unable to finance their operating costs and collapse, and the nation will fail.

Now it it time to either cease being mistaken or cease being honest. Sadly I make the odds about 90% that you will cease to be honest (if you ever were).\n \n \nHowever...

That is not going to happen whit this adminsitration...\n\n \n None of those would do anything at all to solve our current problem.\n \n When a credit bubble bursts, you always end up in a situation where you have a huge overcapacity problem. People often do not realize what a malicious problem overcapacity actually is. It is not just a question of cutting a shift here or there. Companies build their capital base and structure their finance models based on certain capacity assumptions. Off the top of my head I cannot think of even a single company that has ever managed to recover from a serious overcapacity problem. \n \n With the bursting of the credit bubble, loan application denials have increased to nearly 26% of total applications. Mortgage rejections are up by over 60%. It is not AT ALL unreasonable to assume that anywhere from 65-85% of US companies have a SERIOUS overcapacity problem given the contraction in consumer spending that will come with more traditional, reasonable credit standards. OF the companies that DO have a serious overcapacity, I would be EXTREMELY generous to suggest that as many as 10% might actually stay in business and not fail completely.\n \n The ONLY hope we have of solving this without complete economic failure is to boost economic activity to pre-bust levels. That is what they are trying to do with the stimulus packages and the massive deficit spending. The problem of course is that since the bubble was largely built on fluff and fraud, it is going to prove virtually impossible to get the level of economic activity we need. \n \n We certainly need tax reform. We need to see tax rates between 50 and 90%. Somebody has to pay our crushing national debt. I cannot imagine any bankruptcy reform, or even right to work program that would have a significant impact on the economy as a whole. So far right to work laws in the states have produced no measurable impact",

There are some countries...or so I have read (WSJ.com)...that still think US currency is golden. It would be interesting to know if they are bluffing or just as delusional. We can't forget that stupidity doesn't just exist in our country. \n \n TIME actually had a good article the other day on why we shouldn't be the standard currency anymore. In short it said having the US dollar be the standard creates an environment where that country (the US) becomes full of themselves and ends up racking up so much debt that they collapse and take others down with them. \n The advantage of having your country's currency as the world's reserve currency is that you don't really have to play by the rules: You can run big deficits financed by the rest of the world, you can spend more than you earn, and to a certain extent you can escape the consequences of your profligacy by devaluing your currency when you run into trouble. The obvious disadvantages are that running big deficits and spending more than you earn aren't really great long-term economic strategies.\n \n\n The author misses the point a little and assumes China is doing us a favor....well they are...but that favor is to make us learn a valuable lesson and not to save the dollar (which the author thinks).",
