   "Felony Hate Crime Charges for 3 in Anti-Gay Chicago Attack - Towleroad, More than gay news. More gay men\n \n \n \n In mid-January I posted about Daniel Hauff, a gay man who was attacked on the Chicago \"L\" train after he tried to help a stranger his attackers had targeted. \n \n The Sun-Times reports: Hauff \"On Jan. 10, 2010, Sean Little, Benjamin Eder and Kevin McAndrew were riding the CTA Red Line train when Little allegedly began verbally harassing and shoving a gay youth. Daniel Hauff, of Rogers Park, came to the youth's aid, at which point Little allegedly began directing anti-gay slurs at Hauff and pushed him. Eder and McAndrew, who had been watching before, allegedly joined in the assault, calling Hauff a 'stupid fa***t,' and all three men began punching and bloodying Hauff's face in front of train passengers, according to a release from Hauff's attorney.\"\n \n Hauff said he escaped by wiping some of his blood on the attackers and telling them he was HIV-positive.\n \n Yesterday, the misdemeanor batteries against the three men involved in the attack were dropped in court, but they got a bit of a surprise as they were leaving the courtroom:\n \n \"As the three men left the courtroom, they were immediately re-arrested and charged with felony hate crimes as a result of a review of the case by the State's Attorney and the Chicago Police Department.\"",
