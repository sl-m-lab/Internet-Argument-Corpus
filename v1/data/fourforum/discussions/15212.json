   "Brutus: you always miss the point. We all suffer when anti American liberals steal capital from our most heroic and productive citizens. The more liberals steal venture capital the fewer ventures we have. That means fewer jobs and slower economic growth. A child could understand, just not a brainwashed liberal.\n\n \n You keep talking about \"stealing\" venture capitol. We dont tax venture capital, we tax income, and venture capital is typically achieved through some type of securitized mezzanine financing facility. The only way your argument makes sense is if you wanted to argue that by taxing the income of the wealthy you are decreasing the available capital of some hypothetical angel investor, which is what many/most Americans think of when they hear \"venture capitalist\". As we are discussing in another thread, most americans are ignorant. When it comes to venture capital, angel investors are almost unheard of, and are certainly unheard of on any measurable level. That is just not the way such things are financed anymore.\n \n Even traditional angel investors do not fit the mold here anymore. Today angel investors pool their capital and share research. Your typical angel investment pool is never actually used as venture capital. Instead they organize a security offering and use their capital to insure the resulting securities against default. It is a cheap way to leverage their money.\n \n The other financing you typically see from angel investors (and probably the most common anymore) is providing the capital to make an IPO, often with the marketing to go with it it. Say you have an idea, have proven the idea is sound, but lack the capital to bring it to market. If the idea has any merit, there is a better than average chance that you can pick up an angel investor (which is usually going to actually be a pool unless you are stuck in FFF hell). They help fund an IPO and pay to market your IPO. You essentially pay your angel investor in stock, which they sell at the beginning of the IPO. Typical return on a transaction like this is 20-30x. If you have picked a good angel investor they are now out of it and you have ample capital to take your product to market....or pay yourself lavishly until the money runs out and then hand the whole mess to the bankruptcy court and let them work it out...whatever. \n \n The financial world is FAR, FAR more complex than your dad is telling you. In the real world over 96% of expansion capital in this country is newly generated by our fractional reserve banking system. Another 1.5% is self funded. You are essentially arguing that we should base our tax policy on 2.5% of expansion capital. \n \n That is dumb.\n \n And frankly history makes you look silly in your claims. George Washington paid more in taxes than wealthy Americans have in the last 10 years. Literally. Wealthy Americans have NEVER paid less in taxes as a total percentage of assets than they have in the last decade. Where the hell are all the jobs? Where are all the new ventures that should be pupping up due to their obscenely low (historically) tax rate??? \n \n At the same time, the fastest absolute growth in this country ever took place immediately following WWII. At that point the wealthy were txed 90% on yearly income over $1 million. WE HAD A 90% TAX BRACKET, and that was when our nation grew the most. We literally grew so fast, and became so wealthy, that our entire nation has been living off that wealth since the late 70s. \n \n The truth is that it has virtually nothing to do with tax rates. Fractional banking and relative loose securitization laws ensure that there will be ample money out there for startup and expansion purposes, and the wealthy will invest in things that will make them money, and not invest in things that will lose them money, regardless of the tax rate. Nobody says \"Gee....I would make a million dollars on this investment, but if I am going to have to pay 32% taxes on that million dollars SCREW IT, I will put that money in CDs at 1.2% instead\". That is just not reality. \n \n We are trying to run a capitalist system with a wealth distribution that absolutely precludes the possibility of a capitalist system. In order for a capitalist system to work, the majority of wealth MUST rest in the middle and lower classes. This is not optional. You simply cannot have a capitalist system unless this is true. Exactly how much of that wealth must rest in the middle and lower class is a matter of some debate, with different economist arguing in favor of anywhere from 63% to 70% of wealth being held by the bottom 80% of your people. \n \n That is simply what you MUST HAVE in order for capitalism to work. It is quite literally the cornerstone of capitalism and why capitalism is considered by most people to be the fairest, most just economic system out there. \n \n So, what we have here in the US IS NOT CAPITALISM. By definition it is NOT capitalism. But we keep trying to manage it as if it is. IF this was actually a capitalist system your argument might have had some merit 30 years ago, before complex securitization and derivatives were widely used. \n \n Today your argument is just plain silly. Remember the financial crash we just had, caused by terrible loan quality....hundreds of thousands of dollars being loaned to people who could not demonstrate that they had ever paid a bill on time or held a job? That entire situation was caused by the fact that the top 1% has essentially run out of things to invest in. They loaned money to crack whores because they just really did not have anywhere to put that money. \n \n That is where our massive, economy wide bubbles are coming from. Our stock market valuations are absolutely insane. Bonds that should be paying 27% interest are paying 6%. It is classic investment inflation, and it is only cause by, and has only ever BEEN caused by overabundance of idle investment capital.",

The guy who calls his fund manager once a month is not working. He is living off investment income. \n \n And nobody was talking about what anybody \"deserves\". We were talking about taxation, which is required to pay to maintain the infrastructure that allows us to make money. \n \n \n \nWhat definition is that?\n\n \n Any. Going all the way back to Smith in 1776 a \"vibrant\" middle class is required for any capitalist system to work. That is a large part of what makes capitalism unique, and why it is generally considered to be the most just economic system. For it to work the majority of your money has to be out there in the economy among the middle and lower classes circulating. If you end up in the situation where we are, with the vast majority of the money concentrated in the hands of a few, the system breaks down.\n \n Look at the recent economic crisis. The entire crisis was essentially a recognition that pricing discovery had broken down completely. At the end of the day any free market system at its basest level is nothing BUT a price discovery mechanism. If price discovery has broken down your entire economy is essentially a farce...it is not doing its primary job. \n \n In this case the break down was essentially caused by investment level hyperinflation. Econ 101...too much money chasing too few goods leads to inflation. The same thing happens with investments as happens with a loaf of bread at the corner supermarket. If you end up with too much capital in your top 20%, where that money tends to be put into investments instead of spent against goods and services, you end up in a situation where the real economy stagnates due to lack of wealth while investments get expensive because there is so much capital chasing so few investment opportunities. \n \n In the past this has been self correcting to some degree because of the limited investment opportunities. Today we have the technology to create and track a multi trillion dollar derivatives market which allows us to artificially leverage the relatively few investment opportunities out there that are actually backed by hard assets.\n \n It will eventually end up \"correcting\" anyway, the odds of our economy surviving it are just FAR worse than they have been in the past. \n \n \n This is a complement brutus, how many times he calls an argument silly or stupid is a proxy for how unable he is to counter it. \n\n \n Wow, this would totally be true if not for the several paragraphs I had posted countering his position and explaining exactly why it is silly in the context of modern economics.\n \n You, on the other hand, just post a bunch of silly gibberish based on moral truths that you should really probably be discussing in the religion forum, not the economics forum. \n \n Imbecile.",

   "try to be logical, about an important point, and I will follow, of course\n\n Alright, you claimed it was necessary for government to tax.\n \n I asked why it is wrong to tax for A as opposed to B.\n \n You said A was wrong because it required violence and a loss of liberty, while B was right because most people would agree with it and because it is for the benefit of the taxed person.\n \n I asked: \n 1. Is a tax is moral just because most people agree with it?\n \n 2. Is a tax it was moral just because it is supposed to be for one's own benefit?\n \n I asked why it is not a loss of liberty nor violent to collect tax money by force regardless of what it's for.\n \n You answered that:\n 1. who knows what a right is, it is generally a legal right if most people agreed with it.\n \n 2. sure.\n \n On the surface it appears you are in a state of self-contradiction.\n \n You make statements about right and wrong (by answering my initial question on taxes), then you act as if 'no one knows what a right is'. You say something is a legal right if most agree to it but do not hesitate to condemn something even though most people agreed with it, in fact you volunteered the example (nazi killing jews).\n \n You spoke of the loss of liberty yet you answered 'yes' to forcing (force = violence if the victim fights back) money out of someone so long as you justified it by claiming it was for their own good. I suspect if I or anyone else did that to you, you would think your liberties infringed upon.\n \n My point is that in a strong way this hypocrisy about the nature of government, rights, liberty, and taxation lends great validity to the enemies of freedom around the world.\n \n You and others like you set up a scenario in which you boisterously denounce government programs and taxes on the grounds of them infringing on peoples liberty and destroying their rights. Recognize first that this is a moral claim, you are claiming it's wrong because rights and liberty have no meaning beyond morality.\n \n When challenged, when asked for the support of such a moral system your answer is to basically validate their excuses for setting up government programs and the taxes you object to.\n \n You say that it is for the people's own good, people just cannot be trusted to do the right thing with their money (ignoring the fact that you are one such person and you are now making the decision) and that it is right to do it if it's for their own good.\n \n The only standard you set there is if in the opinion of he/she who advocates the tax it will benefit the taxed somehow. This is how the left DOES justify it to themselves.\n \n You then follow it up with an even worse admission, that if the public/majority/most people think it's moral; it is moral. This especially is how they justify it. 9/10 if I say something negative about a government action, those who support it will just jump in and say that since 'we' elected the people who brought it about; it was the people. They leave it at that as if popular support was a moral defense.\n \n To sum it up, you say: \"Taxes and government are arbitrary, no objective morality exists; but I just don't like the way you want to do things\"\n \n and they (this now being perfectly logical response) say: \"You are right taxes and government are arbitrary, no objective morality exists, we don't care about your opinion, let's see what happens come election day\".\n \n No wonder it seems like whining when rightist complain about spending and taxes after they all but admit that they think the elector will be perfectly justified by the majority should he/she have been on their side.\n \n The truth is that it is wrong to tax to pay for your neighbors house and it is wrong to tax to pay for the police department.\n \n That is because the crucial deciding factor in what constitutes a loss of liberty, the violation of a right, is not what the tax is used for, but only that it was used with the permission of the owner.\n \n The proper moral standard is applied to individuals, note that if you take your neighbors wallet and go to court; there is only one defense that will get you off the hook.\n \n \"He let me have it\"\n \n Try as an experiment getting 55% of your neighbors to agree that his wallet must be taken and present that in court.\n \n Try also to use a good portion of that money to buy your neighbor presents.\n \n Try to claim that your neighbor had a social duty to help you.\n \n None of it will fly because none of it is a valid moral defense.",

In that year, he cut the dividend and capital gains rates to 15 percent each, and the economy responded. In two years, stocks rose 20 percent. In three years, $15 trillion of new wealth was created.

In fact, the CBO did a study on the 1986 change and concluded that a reduction to 15% would reduce revenue from capital gains taxes and that the increase in 1986 led to an overall INCREASE in tax revenue even with their conclusions that higher capital gains rates will reduce capital gains revenue. What we can conclude from this is that like all tax rates there is a point where if you tax too much you won't get anymore revenue. We know for a fact that it is well over 15% and at least 33%. I suspect it cannot be higher than the individual income tax rate and probably has to be a little lower. More importantly, you should notice I said \"capital gains tax revenue\" and not overall government revenue. There is no evidence that these changes effect government revenue negatively. \n \n There is strong evidence that the economy effects tax revenue though.

If you look at 1985 compared to 1986 compared to 1987 you will see a HUGE increase in 1986 before the law went into effect. This, however, was temporary and in 1987 it was higher than 1985. This only shows us that when people know about a change they take advantage but overall behaviors did not change much. In 1997 when the tax rate changed to 20% we actually saw a decrease in the rate at which tax revenue was going up. From a CBO report: \"For example, a number of observers have attributed the rapid rise in realizations in the late 1990s to the 1997 cut in capital gains tax rates. But the 45 percent increase in realizations in 1996--before the cut--exceeded the 40 percent and 25 percent increases in 1997 and 1998 that followed it. Careful studies have failed to agree on how responsive gains realizations are to changes in tax rates, with estimates of that responsiveness varying widely. \"\n \n In 2004 you saw a slight increase as the economy picked up but naturally it fell again when the economy went back down. So again, there is no evidence decreasing helps and the best data out there suggests that increasing it would probably take in more money.",

The resulting increase in the capital stock yields greater output and higher incomes throughout much of the economy.\" \n \n \n\n There is strong evidence that the economy effects tax revenue though.

   "Bschool 101 for you: every business investment is made on the margin. If muni bonds pay .5% more billions and billions will flow into them. Reduce or eliminate tax on capital gains, billions flow there and economy booms!!!\ntax free investments are priced as such. With the average rate of return for stocks versus municipal bonds you would have to tax at 40% to have the same rate of return. Apparently you don't believe the free market system works.\n \n \nAre you saying that CBO has reached a conclusion about capital gains?????? Yes or NO???\nThe reached a conclusion about the increase in 1986. It's not exactly a leap of faith to think that if going from 20 to 33% would increase revenue than 15 to 20 would as well\n \n \nfact????? exactly where is the fact from ???????\nCBO\n \n \nSince you like the CBO here's what they say today, not in 1986, genius:\n \n \"In general, there is significant consensus that broad-based reductions in taxes on capital have the potential to boost economic growth over the long run. Reductions in capital taxation increase the return on investment and therefore the formation of capital. The resulting increase in the capital stock yields greater output and higher incomes throughout much of the economy.\" \nI've already quoted from the 2002 paper. Read the thing again.\n \n Capital Gains Taxes and Federal Revenues\n The sensitivity of realizations to gains tax rates raises the possibility that a cut in the rate could so increase realizations that revenue from capital gains taxes might rise as a consequence. Rising gains receipts in response to a rate cut are most likely to occur in the short run. Postponing or advancing realizations by a year is relatively easy compared with doing so over much longer periods. In addition, a stock of accumulated gains may be realized shortly after the rate is cut, but once that accumulation is \"unlocked,\" the stock of accrued gains is smaller and realizations cannot continue at as fast a rate as they did initially. Thus, even though the responsiveness of realizations to a tax cut may not be enough to produce additional receipts over a long period, it may do so over a few years. The potentially large difference between the long- and short-term sensitivity of realizations to tax rates can mislead observers into assuming a greater permanent responsiveness than actually exists.\n \n Because of the other influences on realizations, the relationship between them and tax rates can be hard to detect and easy to confuse with other phenomena. For example, a number of observers have attributed the rapid rise in realizations in the late 1990s to the 1997 cut in capital gains tax rates. But the 45 percent increase in realizations in 1996--before the cut--exceeded the 40 percent and 25 percent increases in 1997 and 1998 that followed it. Careful studies have failed to agree on how responsive gains realizations are to changes in tax rates, with estimates of that responsiveness varying widely. \n\n Furthermore, you cherry picked the quote. Directly after that paragraph was this:\n But the potential for big growth effects from a capital gains tax cut is much smaller than it is for a more general cut in the tax on capital. For example, Congressional researchers estimated that a cut of the magnitude proposed in 1990 or enacted in 1997 (25 percent to 30 percent) would reduce the tax on corporate capital by only 2.7 percent and would decrease the cost of capital by less than 1 percent.(8) Some additional reduction in the cost of capital might result from the salutary effects of improved liquidity as a consequence of less lock-in. But such an impact would also be small. \n\n \nso then genius does a tax increase make the economy grow or shrink???????\nDepends. Tax increases have made the economy grow and tax decreases have as well. Pretty irrelevant at this point since we are forced to increase taxes for the mistakes of the past. \n \n \ngenius steve, A and B contradict each other. CBO has no opinion on capital gain!!!\nHow is that a contradiction? The guy was wrong, or rather misleading, about the 1980s \"drop\" in tax revenue. Furthermore, studies are inconclusive about the effects. \n \n \nso then why be so afraid to show the best date?? What does you fear tell you??\nbest date? What date? Today's date is 5/11/2011.",

The government heavily subsidized carriers as well as footing the bill on virtually every major airport in the US. It did no good to get on a plane in New York if you were standing at the only airport in the country. You could just fly up and then land back where you started. That would be a silly waste of time and resources. \n \n Air travel in the US did not become profitable until the government had spend nearly $100 billion on airports. At that point the network of airports was big enough to actually get people where they need to go, thus allowing enough passengers to utilize the service to make it profitable. \n \n The current chinese rail system is still in its infancy. There is absolutely no question that rail travel is the most efficient way to move people and cargo. Capitalist theory says that the market WILL gravitate to the most efficient solution to a problem.\n \n Are you saying that capitalism does not work???",

   "absurd of course, a road does not create wealth it merely enables transportation. A billion miles of new road would be a huge waste and cause a huge depression since we obviously have built the roads we need as we needed them with the money on had locally where there are sensible controls based on actual need.\n\n \n Which is why you have to spend your money wisely. \n \n \nWealth comes from innovations, the switch from whale oil to hydrocarbon oil to electricity. The switch from growing your food to buying it in a can, from horse to car, from train to plane,from the typewriter to word processor, from hand washing to automatic washing machines. Governemnt is not only not needed but kills the process as Stalin and Mao and Castro and FDR found out.\n\n \n ROTFLMAO. EVERY SINGLE ONE of your examples was made possible because of massive infrastructure improvements by the government. Our electrical grid would not have been built without massive government subsidies (the first government subsidy for a power grid was made to Westinghouse...the guy who built the first large commercial power station). We would not be driving around in cars if the government had not focused on pipeline construction as a needed infrastructure item. \n \n I am not sure why you keep tossing Mao, Stalin, and Castro out. None of them are known for large scale infrastructure improvements. In fact, all 3 are known primarily for FAILING to adequately invest in infrastructure. \n \n FDR is another matter. The hoover dam, an FDR project, has literally paid for itself over 27,000 times over. The 20,000 miles of water mains that were constructed during the new deal paid for themselves roughly 14,000 times over. The 325 new firehouses built and 2834 of them renovated across the country paid for themselves in less than 6 years through lower fire insurance premiums for the people served. The flood control projects that were done as part of the new deal have paid for themselves roughly 10,000 times over (an estimate by necessity because it is impossible to say for sure how much damage the averted floods would have cost). \n \n The intangible assets are of course impossible to estimate, but pretty much all experts point at the vocational training programs that took place during the new deal as the primary reason that the US was able to bring up production so quickly in order to fight WWII....so not only did he turn out to be one of the most badass wealth creating business oriented presidents in history, he also pretty much saved the country with his vocational training program. \n \n Innovation is great, but it does not happen in a vacuum. You could invent a cold fusion reactor tomorrow in your basement that would produce unlimited free power forever, and without an electrical grid to carry it, it would mean nothing.",

Yeah firehouses, dams, some roadways, and water projects were good but FDR did them for the wrong reasons and other aspects of the New Deal totally screwed us later on. For one, it didn't pull us out of a depression which was the basic goal. Infrastructure upgrades should be an ongoing matter for the government and not a way to end a downturn. WWII was much more beneficial to ending the recession. On the plus side the parks created, firehouses, roads, etc were good projects and probably all 100% unconstitutional (hard to claim a fire station is interstate commerce).

Is a true high speed train from New York to Washington going to increase commerce? You have a couple mines in Kansas, I'd be interested to hear what would help your business or industry grow.\n\n \n First of all, I agree with you on the new deal. I just dont think that condemning something that was such an incredibly effective infrastructure improvement program is a good idea. Many of the other aspects of it certainly screwed us later on, but the infrastructure portion turned out to be one of the most effective infrastructure programs the world has ever seen. \n \n I would also agree that the government should be doing constant infrastructure maintenance and upgrade. At the same time, when you have a major economic downturn it does provide the government with a unique opportunity to carry off large scale improvements at a bargain price. Right now the government could essentially get the workers they need for roughly the price of their unemployment, which the government is already paying. \n \n As far as suggested infrastructure upgrades, the first would be the electric grid. Our electric grid is basically 50 years old and based on 90 year old technology. Per capita power consumption continues to increase to the point that we have rolling blackouts somewhere in the US every summer because the grid wont handle the demand. At the same time we are trying to bring things like electric cars to market, so we can plug them into an electrical grid that will not support their use. We don not have a power generation shortage in this country. We literally have about 35% of our generating capacity shut down all the time, even when we have rolling blackouts going in parts of the country, because we cant get the power where it needs to be. \n \n We need a nationwide grid update. We need to mandate universal 3 phase availability and make it standard on new installations. Anything up to a 500 amp installation should be just a phone call and a free install away, and it should not blow out the entire neighborhood substation when you plug your Tesla roadster into it. \n \n The second thing we need to be looking at is transportation. You are going to have trouble finding anybody intelligent outside a political ad that is not willing to admit that the days of cheap oil are over. Putting all our goods on over the road trucks that get 3 miles to the gallon is not a reasonable or realistic strategy for the future. Passenger rail is a whole different subject, we are talking about moving freight here, and doing it efficiently and effectively. \n \n IT/internet is another place where we are lagging behind the rest of the world, and lagging badly, and if we want to be able to compete in the global economy we need to do something about that. This is not 1995 where the internet was a fringe place where nerds hung out. Today in a lot of offices if the internet goes out for a few hours it is a long office wide coffee break. Frankly the internet has the potential to be the most awesome productivity enhancer in the history of mankind. Other nations have certainly seen the potential and have leveraged it to the max. Here in the US we have seen the potential and done not a damn thing with it. You can get a faster internet connection standing on top of a mountain in S Korea than you can get in downtown Kansas City (though google internet is about to change that for a small area). \n \n All of these are split infrastructure/regulatory issues. The power grid, for example, needs to be about 50% enhanced infrastructure and 50% just telling the utilities \"This is how you WILL do business\". The same goes for rail and internet. \n \n The thing is, in all 3 of those examples, those networks were built with SERIOUS incentives supplied by the government, if not downright cash giveaways. Monopolies were awarded in order to ensure profitability. Major public concessions were made to ensure completion. Part of the deal was that they would maintain those networks for the public good. They have not kept up their end of the bargain. We can either force them to, or take those networks away and give them to somebody who will carry their end of the deal.",
