   "From AmericaBlog:\nIt seems the National Council on Family Relations has learned something about gay marriage. Pity they're hiding it.\n \n NCFR is the group that is getting paid by the Bush Administration to put together an online clearinghouse on marriage. As we reported earlier, they've agreed to break their own rules about discriminating against gays to prevent anything about gay marriage or its effects from ever showing up on the White House website. (http://americablog.blogspot.com/2005/05/ncfr-says-marriage-is-great-as-long-as.html)\n \n Which is a shame, because by doing so NCFR is agreeing to conceal what they've already learned about gay marriage. (http://www.ncfr.org/pdf/Same_Sex_Marriage_Fact_Sheet.pdf ) Facts like:\n 33% of female same-sex couple households and 22% of male same-sex couple households reported having at least one child under 18 years of age living in the home.Social science research has found few differences between children of lesbian or gay parents and those of heterosexual parents.Marriage of same-sex couples would protect children born after the marriage took place by providing them with the same rights and benefits as those with heterosexual married parents. \n But you won't see this information on the clearinghouse. You won't even see links to outside sites providing information on gay marriage -- not even NCFR's own research. \n",
