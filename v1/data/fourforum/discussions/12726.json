   "I wanted to move my response to another thread from theis on so we don't further hyjack the Joshua thread.\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/354010-post65.html.\n \n \nReally? Watch this video to see how disrespectful they are to one little old lady who has the courage to also make a political statement. They don't seem to respect that equal right very much. You will also see them pull the cross out of her hand and trample it under foot. I know this wont offend your sensibilities; but as a self declared christian, it should.\n \n YouTube - Palm Springs Prop 8 Rally Turns Ugly\n \n Here's another case of a christian girl/missionary being assaulted by a homosexual for singing \"Amazing Grace\". She didn't press charges and forgave him. Just one more example of homosexual hatred, violence and intolerance.\n \n YouTube - Castro District Gays Attack A Christian Missionary\n\n \n \n First off what a load of KRAPIE. Archangel, you could only find two videos? I could find hundreds of videos from anti gay Christians preaching hate and violence toward gay people. The girl in the second video even contradicted herself when Bill asked her a second time if the police had seen the man hit her and she said no.\n \n Both of these imbeciles went into a charged angry situation, it is almost as if they wanted something to happen. See the problem is and these people prove this, is that they think something is wrong with us. They come into our neighborhoods they put are civil rights on the ballot, they make laws that tear our families apart, using their religion as a weapon and we are supposed to respect that religion? It is as if someone comes into you home with a gun shoots up the place and then sues you for damage to their bullets.\n \n Bill Orielly is an imbecile, bigot, and a homophobe. The courts are not imposing anything upon anyone they are defending the rights of a minority. But you are right we are going about this the wrong way instead of protesting the loss of our civil rights by the tyranny of the majority, we should instead start attacking the root of the problem. That root is the anti gay Christians and the other anti gay groups. When we see them protesting and sing their little songs in our neighborhoods we should start laughing at them, have male on male or female on female kissing groups or start singing We shall over come, or one of our gay anthems. Personally I favor writing the anti gay churches a letter asking them to send me bibles then gathering outside their church on a Sunday morning with a group and burning those bibles, with the burn permits of course, in front of the church as they are arriving.\n \n BTW they can't even respect freedom of religion for others \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ9To30Hz7A",

What you fail in understanding is that sex can be holy and unholy in its expression and your side represents an abomination of sexual expression.\n\n \n Holy and Unholy.... Oh and yeah don;t forget to throw out the word abomination... Jeez once again the same old misguided dribble... this will set the record strait...\n \n From Soulforce.org\n \n PASSAGE 3\n LEVITICUS 18:22 AND 20:13\n THE HOLINESS CODE\n \n Let's move on. What do the two verses sometimes cited from Leviticus say about God?\n \n Leviticus 18:6 reads: \"You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female. It is an abomination.\" A similar verse occurs two chapters later, in Leviticus 20:13: \"A man who sleeps with another man is an abomination and should be executed.\" On the surface, these words could leave you feeling rather uneasy, especially if you are gay. But just below the surface is the deeper truth about God -- and it has nothing to do with sex.\n \n Leviticus is a holiness code written 3,000 years ago. This code includes many of the outdated sexual laws we mentioned earlier, and a lot more. It also includes prohibitions against round haircuts, tattoos, working on the Sabbath, wearing garments of mixed fabrics, eating pork or shellfish, getting your fortune told, and even playing with the skin of a pig. (There goes football!)\n \n So what's a holiness code? It's a list of behaviors that people of faith find offensive in a certain place and time. In this case, the code was written for priests only, and its primary intent was to set the priests of Israel over and against priests of other cultures.\n \n At the age of 10, I signed a holiness code written by the Women's Christian Temperance Union that said I would never taste beer, wine, or liquor. I thought signing it would please God and my grandmother. That's a holiness code. When I was in high school we evangelical Christians had an unwritten holiness code that went like this: \"I don't drink, smoke, or chew, or go with girls who do.\" Now I know what you're thinking. That last part about \"girls who do\" proved especially easy for me. But the point is that I obeyed this evangelical holiness code because my parents said that breaking these rules didn't please God, and I knew it didn't please them.\n \n We had another evangelical holiness code while I was in high school that prohibited dancing. I was student body president, yet I refused to go to the prom because I had promised not to dance. I did this to please God and my mother -- whose mother had made her sign a holiness code that she wouldn't go to dances either.\n \n What about this word abomination that comes up in both passages? In Hebrew, \"abominations\" (TO'EBAH) are behaviors that people in a certain time and place consider tasteless or offensive. To the Jews an abomination was not a law, not something evil like rape or murder forbidden by the Ten Commandments. It was a common behavior by non-Jews that Jews thought was displeasing to God.\n \n Jesus and Paul both said the holiness code in Leviticus does not pertain to Christian believers. Nevertheless, there are still people who pull the two verses about men sleeping together from this ancient holiness code to say that the Bible seems to condemn homosexuality.\n \n But wait, before we go any further, let's ask: What does this text say about God? Even if the old holiness codes no longer apply to us as Christians, it's important to remember that in every age, people of faith are responsible for setting moral and ethical standards that honor God. But we people of faith must be very careful not to allow our own prejudices to determine what those standards should be.\n \n Instead of selecting one item from an ancient Jewish holiness code and using it to condemn sexual or gender minorities, let's talk together about setting sexual standards that please God -- standards appropriate for heterosexuals and homosexuals alike, standards based on loving concern, health, and wholeness for ourselves and for others.\n \n Now what do the Leviticus passages say about homosexuality?\n \n I'm convinced those passages say nothing about homosexuality as we understand it today. Here's why. Consider this single Bible passage that was used for centuries to condemn masturbation:\n \n \"He spilled his seed on the ground... And the thing which Onan did displeased the Lord: wherefore he slew him also\" (Genesis 38:9-10).\n \n For Jewish writers of Scripture, a man sleeping with another man was an abomination. But it was also an abomination (and one worthy of death) to masturbate or even to interrupt coitus (to halt sex with your spouse before ejaculation as an act of birth control). Why were these sexual practices considered abominations by Scripture writers in these ancient times?\n \n Because the Hebrew pre-scientific understanding was that the male semen contained the whole of life. With no knowledge of eggs and ovulation, it was assumed that the man's sperm contained the whole child and that the woman provided only the incubating space. Therefore, the spilling of semen without possibility of having a child was considered murder.\n \n The Jews were a small tribe struggling to populate a country. They were outnumbered by their enemy. You can see why these ancient people felt it was an abomination to risk \"wasting\" even a single child. But the passage says nothing about homosexuality as we understand it today.\n \n We've talked about the passages in the Hebrew Scriptures that are used (or misused) by some people to condemn sexual minorities. Now let's look at three verses from the letters of the apostle Paul in the Christian Scriptures that are used the same way. Remember: First, we'll ask what the text says about God; second, we'll consider what it may or may not say about sexual orientation.",

That is unholy, ungodly, and whatever else you can think of. What a shame for the heterosexuals that become victims of homosexuals looking for a cure. What a shame for the homosexuals who believe they need one. You should be thankful for the vast number of homosexuals that know who and what they are.

They cannnot disrupt our marriage ceremonies either; that's trespassing, and it's also against the law. They can put out horrible propaganda, because of free speech. We can counter that propaganda with our own free speech. \n \n Yes, there is still discrimination against us. The question here is what are the most effective ways to counter the discrimination. We are starting to win now, in the courts, in some legislatures, and in public opinion. We need to think strategically about how to win over more and more of the public and thus to win more concrete victories. Disrupting church services is not an effective tactic, in my view. It alienates people rather than winning them over, and it shifts the focus away from anti-gay discrimination and onto the disruption of the church service. \n \n This is not 1969, and the New York City police no longer raid gay bars. I went to Stonewall 25, a huge city-wide celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall rebellion.

Is it immoral? In my mind, probably, usually. Just as people blocking access to abortion clinics is immoral, in my personal view. They are preventing others from exercising their rights, whether it is engaging in worship or choosing a medical procedure. I would be angry if people who disagreed with the principles of my faith stormed in and disrupted our church services. \n \n This of course gets to the question of whether civil disobedience of this kind is always or necessarily immoral. The anti-abortion protestor would probably argue that the necessity of saving a life, of rescuing an unborn child, outweighs the right to choose to have an abortion, and that the immorality lies with the people providing the abortion and/or the person choosing the abortion. In the view of the anti-abortion protestors, the disruption is a highly moral act, not an immoral one. This is likewise true of the anti-slavery activists who disrupted church services. They disrupted church services out of a higher moral purpose. I don't think that such actions are objectively immoral; the morality of such actions depends on our collective view of what is moral or immoral. \n \n I don't think there is an overarching objective morality. Morality is a matter of belief, of what we collectively believe to be moral or immoral, as best we can work out systems of morality. Morality is not a set of rules handed to us by God. We have to develop ideas about morality as humans. In my personal view, most of the time, actions that deny other people the opportunity to exercise their rights are immoral. But there probably are exceptions to this, times when breaking a law or disrupting people's activities are justified and moral. And when someone chooses to break a law out of a sense of morality and necessity, then they must be willing to accept the consequences of that, to go to jail if necessary, in the tradition of non-violent civil disobedience.",

Though it may be that's not what you mean, exactly. However, it seems to be the logical conclusion of where your argument leads.\n\n \n I do not believe that morality comes from God. I believe that our morality often comes from human beliefs about God. Morality is a human construction; it is not handed to us from on high. This does not mean there is no God or that I don't believe in God. Actually, I do believe in God. I think that our challenge as humans is more difficult because we are not handed morality by God, which would make life simpler. We are not handed moral principles by God; we have to develop them for ourselves. The search to know God is also, in part, a search to develop a morality that is consistent with our beliefs about God and about our common condition as inhabitants of the earth.\n \n This does not mean that morality is entirely random or simply invented and then reinvented with no basis. I am sure that our ideas about morality are rooted in our efforts to survive as a species; morality has roots in biology, certainly. In that sense, our morality is from God in that I believe God created us. But morality rooted in biology is not absolute, because different cultures develop different views of morality, and our struggle to survive has changed with the development of technology and our expanding ability to produce a surplus to enhance survival. I suspect that anti-gay prejudice, which many regard as a moral principle and not prejudice, had its roots in a desire to maximize reproduction and to promote survival through a patriarchal economic and social organization. Over time, however, maximizing reproduction proved to be problematic, and societies have sought instead to limit reproduction, because of environmental and resource problems associated with overpopulation. Also, the need for a patriarchal economic and social order has declined, as male domination has become no longer regarded as necessary for survival. Social change produced a change in gender roles and relations. With growing equality between the sexes, opposition to same-sex relationships has declined, since male domination of women is no longer central to the social and economic order. \n \n As for slavery, there has been a great deal written about this topic, and it's fascinating. One question that historians have addressed and debated is why slavery, which had existed since antiquity, suddenly came to be defined as immoral in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. What brought about this broad change in morality, which swept much of the world? Some have argued that the rise of capitalism led to the belief that all labor must be free and thus produced a growing belief that slavery and other forms of unfree labor are immoral. Others have argued that the rise of Enlightenment ideas about liberty and equality, along with the spread of an individualistic Protestantism, led to the growing belief that slavery was wrong. One leading scholar has argued that people came to regard slavery as wrong as a way to try to justify the exploitation of wage workers instead. There is a history to the belief that slavery is wrong. Do I think slavery was always wrong? In my moral view, yes. But my moral view is just my view, and on this particular issue of slavery, my moral view is consistent with that of the overwhelming majority of people today. This was not the view of the majority in all times. On other issues, my moral view may be a minority view. \n \n My morality is not absolute. No one's is, though some people believe their morality is absolute, as you point out. I do not believe that. \n \n I believe that morality that has religious influence is human, because humans create religion. All morality is human in origin, though much of it probably has a biological basis. But the specific moral principles are developed by humans.\n \n You raise a question about the belief in equality. I do regard equality as a moral principle. It is not absolute, but it is important. And it is a principle to which our society is committed, through the Declaration of Independence especially and also through the constitution, notably in the post-Civil War amendments. There is a basis in our founding principles and in our constitution for demanding equality; equality is one of the foundational principles of the American republic. I see many social change movements in the United States as focusing on making real life in the society consistent with this founding principle of equality. Groups have struggled over time to make the principles of liberty and equality expressed in the Declaration real in the society. There is a basis for arguing for equality not only out of morality, but because it is a foundational principle of our republic.\n \n My views of morality may be out of the mainstream, and I don't care about that. I don't decide on what I think based on what I imagine the mainstream thinks. To the extent that some progressives may view their beliefs as coming from God, I don't agree with them about that. I may agree with what they believe but not on its origins. But that's okay. There are plenty of people with whom I disagree on some or many things, but I like them and respect them anyhow. I disagree with you on a variety of matters, and I like and respect you.",

It's a bedrock principle of libertarianism. I hold to this view to great extent myself and am not opposed to gay rights in most all cases despite my moral views.",

Am I being clear about the distinction? I may be committed to my view of morality, but I regard it as my personal view of morality, not as an absolute handed down from God. \n \n You are right that my personal conception of God is mostly a hands off one. I think God created us as humans to struggle with and develop our own understandings of things, including our moral principles.

I believe in no religious doctrine, and I don't think doctrine is necessary to engage in religious practice. I think doctrine usually tends to get in the way of religious practice, because people fight with each other about points of doctrine and abandon the practice of seeking God.\n \n I believe that God exists outside of religion. Religion is a human creation, in my view. But then, I could be wrong. I'm fine with that. I have to remember always that I could be wrong. \n \n I think all beliefs should be reconsidered. I think every idea and every belief should be up for critical scrutiny in light of new knowledge and new perspectives. That's partly why I post in these forums, to subject my beliefs to critical scrutiny. I do have beliefs that I regard as central in my life, but even they are up for reconsideration, or they should be, in my view. I hope that the beliefs to which I may be stubbornly committed are beliefs I will hold up to scrutiny and reconsideration.",

   "I might be stubbornly committed to a particular belief, but that doesn't make it a moral absolute. It makes it a belief to which I am stubbornly committed. I am sure there are such beliefs that I harbor. But I regard them as my beliefs to which I am committed, not as moral absolutes. Am I being clear about the distinction? I may be committed to my view of morality, but I regard it as my personal view of morality, not as an absolute handed down from God. \n\n \n I don't mean to imply you're being stubborn. I simply mean that for most all of us, there are things that we believe are absolute, and therefore we have absolute morality. For example, most people would probably agree that it is not ok for a person to physically harm a child. If we see a child being harmed, we become protective (over the child) and outraged, because we hold to some moral absolute that this it is bad to harm children. We tend to think that way across the board--on this we do have a form of over-arching morality. Even if most of society at large for some reason decided that physically harming children is ok, I believe you'd still hold to the view that it is not ok to do so. Ergo, society is not determining your view; something else is. I'm not saying morality is being dictated from God somehow, or that the source of the morality is God. Regardless, it's still an over-arching morality (whether your source is God or social evolution, or whatever.) In my opinion, calling it a belief you are committed rather than an absolute morality (to you) is no more than a semantic distinction. Doctrine is not the enemy of peace. Violent or extremist doctrine, maybe, but not just 'doctrine'. What if one's doctrine is that people should be kind to one another? How could such a doctrine be a source of fighting, other than just someone being purely combative? \n \n \n... I don't think doctrine is necessary to engage in religious practice.\n\n \n I agree. \n \n \nI think doctrine usually tends to get in the way of religious practice, because people fight with each other about points of doctrine and abandon the practice of seeking God.\n\n \n Well, I agree that happens a lot, but it's not always the case. There are matters for which religious people do become unified,and there are cases in which doctrine does not lead to fighting at all. And frankly, my observation is that people will and do find something to fight with each other with or without doctrine. I don't believe doctrine is the cause of the fight, though it may be the excuse. I think the fighting part tends to be due to the fact we are human more than the fact many people hold to doctrine, but that's my opinion. It is, however, based on my observation of people.\n \n \nI think all beliefs should be reconsidered.\n\n \n Again, there are moralistic views that I suspect you would probably say should not be reconsidered, such as the example I gave above. At some point, most people do hold to some moral absolutes, IMO.",

   "It's interesting that the only time we ever hear from \"rational moralists\" is when religion takes a position contrary to what they think should be a moral standard; we never hear from these folks in response to the Mel Whites, Desmond Tutus' and ML Kings', which are all examples of finding the morality in religion. This business of religion versus \"reason\" in terms of morals doesn't square with reality in many cases, from what I see. For many people, there's not a division between religion and rationalist--that rather tends to be a mantra of the anti-theist. Religion IS rational, for many people. This is the view of such figures as John Locke, which had a profound influence on the founding fathers of the American republic. It is also clearly the view of many well-known scientists throughout history. Many historians know where \"rational sense\" took people in such examples as the French revolution and WWI, and it certainly didn't do anything to help in Hitler's regime. Everyone believes their view of what's \"rational\" is THE defacto standard of what's rationa; let's face it--there's no Rationality Committee&#8482; setting any standards here. Heck, even Hitler probably thought he was being rational. That's the problem with making \"rationalism\" one's standard for morality--it's as relativist as anything else (and maybe even more so).

That doesn't say \"there is insufficient proof\".\n It says there is NO proof.\n \n \n \nThis is the view of such figures as John Locke, which had a profound influence on the founding fathers of the American republic. It is also clearly the view of many well-known scientists throughout history.\n\n Claims are made here with absolutely no validation ...\n \n Furthermore, there has to be some question as to the validity of some who claim their RELIGION lead them to a belief, when there are NUMEROUS GENERATIONS BEFORE who had the same religion, but felt their religion lead them to either a different belief, or the OPPOSITE belief.\n \n Take for example those who claim that the bible justifies slavery, as compared to those who claim it condemns slavery.\n A pragmatic analysis of the bible shows that the people who wrote the bible often HAD SLAVES THEMSELVES. Logically, they didn't have a problem with slavery.\n Ergo, the justification that lead modern Christians against slavery is obviously something INDEPENDENT of the bible's influences.\n \n While religion may \"influence\", let's not kid ourselves as to the REAL nature of some of those important CHANGES to the religion.\n \n \n \nMany historians know where \"rational sense\" took people in such examples as the French revolution and WWI, and it certainly didn't do anything to help in Hitler's regime.\n\n Hitler's regime is hardly a good argument for you, as Hitler justified his action TO THE PEOPLE WHO FOLLOWED HIM with Christian quotes.\n And many of the Christians of Hitler's time were VERY anti-semitic to begin with. Even those independent of Nazism had strong influences of anti-semitism.\n Hitler's Christianity\n \n And I have no doubt that some people claim \"rational\" arguments with skewed thinking.

People are told to think something, ergo \"rationality\" is supposed to be checked at the door in favor of blind obedience.\n \n \n \nI'd hate to think my morality was based on merely rationalism, which rises and falls too much on the whims of society and times.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n If you think what is \"rational\" falls and rises based on the whims of society, then you really don't have a clue what \"rational\" means in the first place.\n You confuse it with popular opinion. Very improper.\n \n But beyond that, I can't help but think which is better?\n * Christianity which falls and rises based on the whims of society and times?\n * Or Christianity which holds rigid to its roots? Espousing blatant misogyny and subjugation of women. Allowing slavery. Genocide ordered in the Old Testament with no blink of an eye. Laws against multi-fabric clothing upheld?\n \n While rationality may be a winding road instead of a \"we're at that destination already\", that doesn't mean the trip itself isn't a more valid one than holding a belief on morality just cause you were told to hold it... emoticon_emb",

You may find it a semantic distinction; I see it as a philosophical distinction. Most of the time, when we are not confronted with moral dilemmas, it probably doesn't matter whether we see our morals as coming from God or coming from human thinking. But some of the time, it can and does matter. Not all the time, and not most of the time. Some of the time. \n \n On the issue of harming a child, I do believe that harming a child is wrong. But there are clear examples of even deeply religious people accepting actions that harm children and even endorsing those actions. The fire bombings of Tokyo and the dropping of the two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during WWII are examples. Many children were killed in these attacks, and throughout World War II. Civilian casualties in the war were horrific, and the Allied side took actions, like those I mentioned above, that killed many children. We say that these actions were justified because of the need to win the war. We collectively rationalize harming and killing many children for the purpose of winning the war and saving the free world. So here is an example of our whole society, for the most part, collectively throwing out the moral proscription against harming a child for a larger purpose. Our moral position against harming children has then ceased to be absolute by any definition. It has become relative. We try to assess the relative harm to particular children versus the perceived greater harm of not taking the actions that kill these particular children. \n \n On the matter of doctrine, I have not claimed that doctrine always leads to conflicts. But it often does. Indeed, conflicts over doctrine often drive the debate over marriage equality. Many conflicts in world history have their origins in disputes over religious doctrine. I think people often confuse faith with adherence to doctrine. I personally view faith as a practice, not as a set of beliefs. But that's just my personal view.",

Just like any ideology (e.g. nationalism, partisanship, etc.)--can lead to bad things even in cases where no belief in God is present there whatsoever.

This demonstrates overarching morality, and that we all have our areas of moral absolutism.\n\n \n On the question of whether religion is a source of bigotry or extremism, or whether religion is a means by which people affirm the bigotry or extremist views they hold, I suspect it's probably some of both. Remember that I am not bashing religion here. I am active in my church, and I consider myself to be a religious person. I am not Christian in the traditional sense, but I am an active participant in a faith tradition, and I honor other faith traditions, including Christianity. We Unitarian Universalists are a non-creedal faith, which makes us a bit different from many faiths. Anyhow, on the question at hand, I think that certain religious traditions clearly do promote bigotry and extreme views. And that endorsement by religious bodies, by living religious institutions, serves to promote those viewpoints. It also gives those viewpoints a social legitimacy in the minds of many that they might otherwise not have. On the other hand, bigotry and extreme views have sources other than religion. People who are bigoted often do point to their religious traditions as the authority for their positions. An example, of course, would be people who pointed to the Bible as their support for racial segregation. Racial segregation was not created by the Christian churches in the post-Reconstruction era. It was an institution whose sources were not specifically religious. But people who believed in segregation often claimed that God called for segregation, and they pointed to the story of Ham to try to support their position. This is an obvious example of people using religion to try to support the bigotry or extreme position that they drew from other sources. \n \n On the question of equality for gay people, I think it's quite clear that some churches have had deep involvement in blocking efforts to provide legal and social equality and acceptance for gay people. Not all churches, but some churches. Would people who are anti-gay be just as anti-gay if the churches were not present? I don't think so. We can only speculate, of course, because this is a counter-factual scenario. Churches do exist in people's lives. But it's become clear that in states where people are generally less religious, like Vermont and Iowa, people have been more willing than in other states to embrace equal rights, including equal marriage rights, for gay people. There does appear to be a correlation between degree of religiousity and opposition to equality for gay people. Now, correlation is not the same as causation necessarily. It may be that people who are more traditional in their views of gender roles and marriage are also people who tend to more religious, and the religious institutions do not cause the anti-gay attitudes or promote them. Many churches certainly don't actively promote anti-gay attitudes or laws that discriminate, though they don't necessarily oppose those attitudes or those laws either. However, the organizations that have been most active in promoting anti-gay measures and in opposing equality under the law for gay people have been religious organizations. The Mormon Church was very active in promoting Proposition 8 in California, for example. \n \n My tendency is not to blame the churches as a whole for anti-gay attitudes and discriminatory laws. I do blame some churches for actively promoting anti-gay measures and actively trying to block passage of laws that would bring equality for gay people.",

Being extremist makes the news more. But it's that very salaciousness of being very publicly against homosexuality and many other things that PUTS them in the news, in many cases.

Let's think about this in terms of another group. Let's create a hypothetical scenario, and see how it sounds. Let's imagine a church declares, \"People should not be Jewish. Being Jewish is a sin, a sinful chosen lifestyle. We support laws banning the practice of Judaism. We will work to prevent Jews from marrying Christians, because being Jewish is a sin. People who are openly Jewish should not be allowed in the U.S. military. We do not want Jews to bring their sinful lifestyles into our military. We will work to ban Jews from being teachers in the public schools, so they cannot spread their sinful lifestyle to our children.\" (Remember the Briggs Amendment in California which would have barred gay people from being teachers in the California public schools. The referendum failed, but there were religious groups that supported this amendment.)\n \n So, does it sound like prejudice when it's aimed at Jews? Or should we dismiss this church's anti-Jewish statements as merely expressions of their moral beliefs? Should people refrain from criticizing churches that preach this simply because they claim these sentiments as their moral beliefs? \n \n People can call it moral beliefs all they want, but promoting discrimination against other people simply because they are different is wrong, in my view, and it should be called wrong. I am not making a moral absolutist argument, because I don't believe in moral absolutism. I am making a moral argument that I think is or should be overarching, because of the negative consequences of people promoting discrimination against those who are different. I'm not calling for churches to be forced into silence by law. I am calling for people who find this behavior by some church groups immoral to speak up against the behavior of these church groups. If religious groups want to criticize gay people for living in ways that they regard as immoral, then we have every right to speak up and criticize those churches for promoting discrimination, which we regard as immoral. When the Mormon Church raises enormous sums of money to try to pass laws that prevent gay people from getting married, then they deserve to be criticized. The same is true for the Catholic Church, which fought against same-sex marriage in Massachusetts. They are not immune from criticism just because they are a church and just because they claim to hold moral beliefs.\n \n As we have discussed before, only some church groups actively promote discrimination. But they are loud and visible. I hope in the future that we will see more churches and religious groups standing up for equality for gay people and for equal marriage rights.",

   "People who want gun control do so out of the general knowledge that guns cause harm. Being a gun owner or not a gun owner is not as central to one's humanity, as sexuality is.\n\n \n Being able to defend oneself in threat of death is certainly central to humanity. Again, fighting against CC laws is irrational, as statistics show. Many anti-gun people don't oppose CC laws on the basis of hate toward gun owners; just as many religious people don't oppose gay marriage on the basis of hate toward gays.\n \n \nWhat kind of reasoning is that? It's not reasoned at all. It's saying marriage is simply heterosexual(circular fallacy), and this person is against it. \n\n \n If suddenly 20 and 30 year olds started a movement to try and get in on social security benefits by trying to call themselves \"seniors\" and lower the age in order the get in on the benefits, it would be discriminatory. The issue for many people has never been bigotry--that's often just gay activist talking points speaking. There's a fundamental disagreement going on about what marriage is--that's not the same as hating gays. I know you want to portray some people as malevolently as possible for the sake of politics and your movement. But it's not right to just chalk up everyone any that doesn't agree on this as being examples of bigotry and hate. There are good people that don't agree with you on gay marriage.

   ", I don't think religious people hate gays or harbor bigotry against them as a general rule, yet many fight against gay marriage because they believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman. Even president Obama has asserted this view on more that one occasion.\n\n \n They may not think of themselves as hating gays or being bigots but they are from a gay perspective. From a gay perspective if you do not fully support gay rights and gay equality you are a bigot. If you fight against gay rights you not only hate gays but are a bigot.\n \n \n President Obama supported gay marriage in his state senate race in 1996\n Gabriel Rotello: Obama's Gay Marriage Flip Flop: He Was For It Before He Was Against It\n \n Obama Once Supported Same-Sex Marriage 'Unequivocally'\n \n He will come around I have faith in the man. He holds, my hopes dreams, he is the one.",

   "I think the key phrase there is \"because they are different\", and that's exactly my point: in my experience, that's is not the reason for their stance in many cases. That's all I'm saying.\n\n \"In your experience\"? emoticon_rolleyes\n Quite frankly, you bend over backwards to cater to the self-duplicity that exists within the anti-gay movement to pretend it isn't about that.\n \n Take the whole \"protection of marriage\" propaganda...\n The bible includes MULTIPLE aspects of marriage which obviously SHOULD fall under the \"protection of marriage\" mantra.\n \n Take divorce as one example.\n The bible is VERY EXPLICIT about some aspects of marriage and divorce. Divorce is only granted under specific circumstances.\n Remarriage is NOT an option.\n \n Yet, in examining how the anti-gay marriage front chooses to \"protect\" marriage, they IGNORE the bigger threat that comes from HETEROSEXUAL DIVORCE (50% divorce rate) and concentrate on a threat that comes from people who are \"different\".\n They ignore the threat to \"traditional marriage\" which is MORE PREVALENT, for the obvious reason that it is IN THEIR OWN BACKYARDS.\n It is much easier for them to complain about something in SOMEBODY ELSE'S backyard, because they already know that they wouldn't want to do that in the first place.\n \n And you ignore this hypocritical double-standard in the anti-gay marriage front. You cater to the illusion.\n And the really sad part of all this is that it IS THEIR OWN backyards.\n Take the Evangelicals for example. They have a HIGHER divorce rate than atheists. HIGHER than most Christians.\n They could take it upon themselves to deal with this WITHIN THEIR OWN CHURCH, but the problem runs rampant and is ignored because it is NOT \"different\".\n They have grown comfortable with their own sins, and concentrate on those that are \"different\".\n \n So no, Jyoshu, it IS about attacking something that is \"different\".\n The evidence of that is in the OVER-ABUNDANCE of similar problems they COULD attack in their own backyards, but they leave them alone and they DO fixate on that which is \"different\"... emoticon_emb",

There's a fundamental disagreement going on about what marriage is--that's not the same as hating gays.\n\n \n You don't want people to enter into marriage because of homosexuality.

Simply saying it's religion does not suddenly make it not what it appears to be in every other circumstance of irrational, prejudiced exclusion. And as foundit said, why are they not going after others who go against their religious beliefs but can marry? Could they not be using religion to support a particular social prejudice?

   "Part of the issue there is that non-extremist churches tend to be more about the business of matters completely unrelated to this issue, and that's pretty understandable, IMO. We can't expect most churches to be activists for gay rights. On the other hand, I can understand your frustration with churches who are activist against them as well.\n\n \n Yeah, I think we should not go around criticizing churches that do nothing to try to deny equal rights to gay people in the wider society. I think we should leave them alone. But when churches do take stands in the public arena, on public issues, then they are open to criticism. That applies to my church as well as other churches. I think that churches that actively work to deny equal rights to gay people in the wider society are fair game for criticism.",
