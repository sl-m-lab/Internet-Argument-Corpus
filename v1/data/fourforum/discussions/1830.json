The debate: 'do you want little or less gun-control'?\n\n \n YES! Not only would repealing the 2nd amendment be a viable option, it would be the RIGHT option for the gun control folks to pursue. The way they do it now, which is by whittling away at it and formulaing long and complex theories to convince us that it does not say what any 10 yr old can plainly understand wihtout any help.\n \n The beauty of the constitution is that it can be changed to reflect the times. The further beauty of the constitution is that it is not easy to change. If it just required a simple vote to amend it, we would do it all the time. The reason it was made so difficult to change is so we do not dismiss liberties today that we might need tommorow.\n \n The problem is, the anti-gun lobby in the US KNOWS what the second amendment means. They also know that there is absolutly no way that they could get a constitutional amendment passed repealing the second. IT just is not going to happen, so instead they whittle away at the right.\n \n To me this is not right. If you have an objective (in this case the removal of te right to bear arms) the proper way to do it is to stand and state your case, then allow the people to decide.
