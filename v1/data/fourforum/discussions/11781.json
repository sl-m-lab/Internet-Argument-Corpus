   "But Governor Palin doesn't think so:\n \n http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/10/15/233023/97/640/631928\n\n \n What typical leftist simone quality propaganda. What's this victims name? If she's a real victim and willing to make an ad, why not give her name to personalize her message? And are you actually suggesting that it's ok to justify the killing of at least 1.3 million other babies per year because less than 1% of the women who get abortions were raped? HERE'S the 1% statistic. And Here's searching beyond the myths. \n Rape, Incest and Abortion: Searching Beyond the Myths \n \n David C. Reardon, Ph.D.\n \n \n \"How can you deny an abortion to a twelve-year-old girl who is the victim of incest?\" complains an indignant supporter of abortion. \"And how can you call yourself a loving Christian if you would force a victim of violent rape to give birth to a rapist's child?\"\n \n Every pro-lifer has heard these same challenges in one form or another. They are the emotionally charged questions designed to prove either 1) that pro-lifers are insensitive \"fetus lovers,\" 2) or ethically inconsistent, allowing abortion for some circumstances but not others.\n \n Unfortunately, most pro-lifers have difficulty answering these challenges because the issue of sexual assault pregnancies is so widely misunderstood. Typically, both sides of the debate accept the presumption that women with sexual assault pregnancies would want an abortion and that the abortion would in some way help them to recover from the assault. Thus, the pro-lifer is left in the uncomfortable position of arguing that the sanctity of life is more important than the needs of the sexual assault victim with whom everyone should rightly sympathize.\n \n But in fact, the welfare of the mother and child are never at odds, even in sexual assault cases. Both the mother and child are helped by preserving life, not by perpetuating violence.\n \n The reason most people reach the wrong conclusion about abortion in cases of rape and incest is that the actual experiences of sexual assault victims who became pregnant are routinely left out of the debate. Most people, including sexual assault victims who have never been pregnant, are therefore forming opinions based on prejudices and fears which are disconnected from reality.\n \n For example, it is commonly assumed that rape victims who become pregnant would naturally want abortions. But in the only major study of pregnant rape victims ever done, Dr. Sandra Mahkorn found that 75 to 85 percent chose against abortion.1 This evidence alone should cause people to pause and reflect on the presumption that abortion is wanted or even best for sexual assault victims.\n \n Several reasons are given for not aborting. First, approximately 70 percent of all women believe abortion is immoral, even though many also feel it should be a legal choice for others. Approximately the same percentage of pregnant rape victims believe abortion would be just another act of violence perpetrated against their bodies and their children.\n \n Second, some believe that their child's life may have some intrinsic meaning or purpose which they do not yet understand. This child was brought into their lives by a horrible, repulsive act. But perhaps God, or fate, will use the child for some greater purpose. Good can come from evil.\n \n Third, victims of assault often become introspective. Their sense of the value of life and respect for others is heightened. They have been victimized, and the thought that they in turn might victimize their own innocent child through abortion is repulsive.\n \n Fourth, at least at a subconscious level, the victim may sense that if she can get through the pregnancy, she will have conquered the rape. By giving birth, she can reclaim some of her lost self-esteem. Giving birth, especially when conception was not desired, is a totally selfless act, a generous act, a display of courage, strength and honor. It is proof that she is better than the rapist. While he was selfish, she can be generous. While he was destroying, she can be nurturing.\n \n If giving birth builds self respect, what about abortion? This is a question which most people fail to even consider. Instead, most people assume that an abortion will at least help a rape victim put the assault behind her and go on with her life. But in jumping to this conclusion, the public is adopting an unrealistic view of abortion.\n \n Abortion is not some magical surgery which turns back time to make a woman \"un-pregnant.\" Instead, it is a real life event which is always very stressful and often traumatic. Once we accept that abortion is itself an event with ramifications on a woman's life, then we must carefully look at the special circumstances of the pregnant rape victim. Will an abortion truly console her, or will it only cause further injury to her already bruised psyche?\n \n In answering this question, it is helpful to begin by noting that many women report that their abortions felt like a degrading and brutal form of medical rape.2 This association between abortion and rape is not hard to understand.\n \n Abortion involves a painful examination of a woman's sexual organs by a masked stranger who is invading her body. Once she is on the operating table, she loses control over her body. If she protests and asks for the abortionist to stop, she will likely be ignored or told: \"It's too late to change your mind. This is what you wanted. We have to finish now.\" And while she lies there tense and helpless, the life hidden within her is literally sucked out of her womb. The difference? In a sexual rape, a woman is robbed of her purity; in this medical rape she is robbed of her maternity.\n \n This experiential association between abortion and sexual assault is very strong for many women. It is especially strong for women who have a prior history of sexual assault, whether or not she is presently pregnant as the result of an assault.3 This is just one reason why women with a history of sexual assault are likely to experience greater distress during and after an abortion than other women.\n \n Second, research shows that after any abortion, it is common for women to experience guilt, depression, feelings of being \"dirty,\" resentment of men, and lowered self-esteem. What is most significant is that these feelings are identical to what women typically feel after rape. Abortion, then, only adds to and accentuates the traumatic feelings associated with sexual assault. Rather than easing the psychological burdens of the sexual assault victim, abortion adds to them.\n \n This was the experience of Jackie Bakker, who reports: \"I soon discovered that the aftermath of my abortion continued a long time after the memory of my rape had faded. I felt empty and horrible. Nobody told me about the pain I would feel deep within causing nightmares and deep depressions. They had all told me that after the abortion I could continue my life as if nothing had happened.\"\n \n Those encouraging abortion often do so because they are uncomfortable dealing with rape victims, or perhaps out of prejudice against victims whom they see as being \"guilty for letting it happen.\" Wiping out the pregnancy is a way of hiding the problem. It is a \"quick and easy\" way to avoid dealing with the woman's true emotional, social and financial needs.\n \n According to Kathleen DeZeeuw, \"I, having lived through rape, and also having raised a child 'conceived in rape,' feel personally assaulted and insulted every time I hear that abortion should be legal because of rape and incest. I feel that we're being used by pro-abortionists to further the abortion issue, even though we've not been asked to tell our side.\"\n \n The case against abortion of incest pregnancies is even stronger. Studies show that incest victims rarely ever voluntarily agree to an abortion.4 Instead of viewing the pregnancy as unwanted, the incest victim is more likely to see the pregnancy as a way out of the incestuous relationship because the birth of her child will expose the sexual activity. She is also likely to see in her pregnancy the hope of bearing a child with whom she can establish a true loving relationship, one far different than the exploitive relationship in which she has been trapped.\n \n But while the incest victim may treasure her pregnancy because it offers her hope of release, and the hope of finding a nurturing love, her pregnancy is a threat to the exploiter. It is also a threat to the pathological secrecy which may envelop other members of the family who are afraid to acknowledge that the abuse is occurring. Because of this dual threat, the victim may be coerced into an unwanted abortion by both the abuser and other family members.\n \n For example, Edith Young, a 12-year-old victim of incest impregnated by her stepfather, writes twenty-five years after the abortion of her child: \"Throughout the years I have been depressed, suicidal, furious, outraged, lonely, and have felt a sense of loss... The abortion which was to 'be in my best interest' just has not been. As far as I can tell, it only 'saved their reputations,' 'solved their problems,' and 'allowed their lives to go merrily on.'... My daughter, how I miss her so. I miss her regardless of the reason for her conception.\"\n \n Abortion providers who ignore this evidence, and neglect to interview minors presented for abortion for signs of coercion or incest, are actually contributing to the young girl's victimization. They are not only robbing the victim of her child, they are concealing a crime, abetting a perpetrator, and handing the victim back to her abuser so that the exploitation can continue.\n \n Finally, we must recognize that the children conceived through sexual assault also have a voice which deserves to be heard. Julie Makimaa, conceived by an act of rape, works diligently against the perception that abortion is acceptable or even necessary in cases of sexual assault. While sympathetic to the suffering her mother endured at the hands of her attacker, Julie is also rightfully proud of her mother's courage and generosity. Regarding her own view of her origin, Julie proclaims: \"It doesn't matter how I began. What matters is who I will become.\"\n \n That's a slogan we can all live with.",

   "And HERE'S another link that needs to be posted in response to simones lies and propaganda.\n Constitutionally Illegitimate\n \n Feminists often tout rhetoric about a woman\u00eds \u00ecconstitutional right\u00ee to abortion. But is Roe v. Wade consistent with the U.S. Constitution?\n \n Constitutional scholars\u00f3including those who are pro-abortion\u00f3have a hard time taking Roe v. Wade seriously. Abortion supporter John Hart Ely, former dean of Stanford Law School, admits that the Roe decision \u00ecis not constitutional law.\u00ee\n \n The Court reasoned: A \u00ecright to privacy\u00ee exists in the Constitution, therefore, this right is broad enough to \u00ecencompass a woman\u00eds decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\u00ee But nowhere does the Constitution mention a \u00ecright to privacy.\u00ee Rather, those who wish to advance the pro-abortion agenda have extrapolated the concept from unrelated amendments.\n \n \u00ecWith Americans believing so dearly in a right to be left alone, it may surprise many people that the Constitution does not include the word \u00ebprivacy\u00ed and offers no explicit mention of it,\u00ee wrote Joan Biskupic, a columnist who covers the U.S. Supreme Court for The Washington Post. \u00ecWhen Justice Harry A. Blackmun, the author of Roe, invoked such a right to strike down laws banning abortion, he was relying on no specific wording in the Bill of Rights or in any previous court decision.\u00ee\n \n In addition to creating this new term, the Court avoided defining it. Furthermore, one would suppose that if a \u00ecright to privacy\u00ee did exist, it would apply only to activities that affect no one else. Yet abortion affects the baby\u00f3an unwilling third party\u00f3which brings us back to the Court\u00eds inability to tackle the controversial issue of defining the beginning of \u00eclife,\u00ee the point at which the baby\u00eds personhood is established.\n \n Michael McConnell, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Utah, writes:\n \n The court can deny such protection to fetuses only if it presupposes they are not persons \u00d6 One can make a pretty convincing argument, however, that fetuses are persons. They are alive; their species is Homo sapiens. They are not simply an appendage of the mother; they have a separate and unique chromosomal structure. Surely, before beings with all the biological characteristics of humans are stripped of their rights as \u00ecpersons\u00ee under the law, we are entitled to an explanation of why they fall short. For the court to say it cannot \u00ecresolve the difficult question of when life begins\u00ee is not an explanation.\n \n Additionally, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O\u00edConnor writes, \u00ecPotential life is no less potential in the first weeks of pregnancy than it is at viability or afterwards \u00d6 I believe that the state\u00eds interest in protecting potential human life exists throughout the pregnancy [emphasis added].\u00ee\n \n The Hard Cases\n \n The \u00echard cases\u00ee have become an abortion rights rallying point. Abortion advocates point to the tragedy of rape or incest and ask, \u00ecWhy should these women be forced to suffer through a nine-month pregnancy after they have already endured such abuse?\u00ee But rape and incest cases are not typical situations of women seeking abortion. Pregnancies resulting from rape are extremely rare: only .06 of 1 percent of all pregnancies. To justify more than 1.2 million abortions a year on the basis of the relatively few pregnancies resulting from rape would be ludicrous.\n \n Still, for those few women who do find themselves in this tragic situation, abortion is not a compassionate alternative. The child of rape is no less a human being than the child of a loving marriage. And it is certainly unjust to put a child to death for the sins of the father.\n \n Moreover, research indicates that such abortions enhance the physical and emotional turmoil of the woman rather than relieve it. In fact, the only major study of pregnant rape victims, conducted by Dr. Sandra Mahkorn, revealed that 75 to 85 percent chose against abortion. Women in these situations need the compassionate support of churches, friends and family to help them begin to heal.\n \n HARD CASES:\n \n Statistically Negligible percentages of abortions due to rape, incest, cases which involve the deformity of the child or endanger the life of the mother:\n \n RAPE: .06%\n \n INCEST: 1%\n \n DEFORMITY: 2-4%\n \n THREAT TO MOTHER\u00edS LIFE: .06-1%\n \n The total of all \u00echard cases\u00ee combined account for only 2-3, at most 5, percent of all abortion cases.\n \n If we believe that life is indeed sacred, it is inconsistent that the \u00ecquick fix\u00ee of abortion could ever be acceptable. Concessions for rape and incest suggest that no good can possibly come from bearing this child. But the circumstances of a child\u00eds conception do not have to dictate the remainder of his life. Julie Makimaa was conceived by an act of violent rape. She is both sympathetic toward her mother\u00eds suffering and proud of her courage and generosity. Julie founded Fortress International, an organization that defends rape and incest victims who have become pregnant and the children conceived by those acts. With David Reardon, she has co-authored a book that responds to the argument favoring abortion in assault pregnancies. \u00ecIt doesn\u00edt matter how I began,\u00ee says Julie. \u00ecWhat matters is who I will become.\u00ee\n \n Fact: All Life is Sacred\n \n In the fiery controversy of abortion in America, emotionally charged rhetoric rooted in fiction too often takes precedence over fact.\n \n But the facts speak for themselves. The unborn child is a precious human being who deserves legal protection. Women facing unplanned pregnancies must be embraced with compassion. Clearly, abortion is not compassion.\n \n It\u00eds time to shatter the myths of pro-abortion propaganda and determine that life will be America\u00eds choice.",

From Wiki:\n \n Accreditation status\n California Miramar University is not accredited[3][2] by any higher education accreditation agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education or the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (agencies that recognize the accepted higher education accreditors in the United States). As such, its degrees may not be acceptable to employers or other institutions. In some jurisdictions the use of degree titles from the university may be restricted or illegal. [1][4] Jurisdictions that have restricted or made illegal the use of credentials from unaccredited schools include Oregon [2][5], Florida, [6] Michigan[7], Maine[8], North Dakota[5]New Jersey[5], Washington[2][9], Nevada[2], Illinois[2], Indiana[2], Texas,[1] and Mexico.[10] Many other states are also considering restrictions on unaccredited degree use in order to help prevent fraud. [11]\n \n California Miramar University received state approval to operate[12] from the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education. State approval should not be confused with accreditation; regionally or nationally accredited institutions were not required to seek California state approval.[13] According to the Bears' Guide to Earning Degrees by Distance Learning, \"There truly is no simple answer to the accredited vs. unaccredited issue, other than to say that one can rarely go wrong with a properly accredited degree. We hear from a moderate number of people who have made good use of an unaccredited (but totally legitimate) degree, but we hear from many more who have had significant problems with such degrees, in terms of acceptance by employers, admission to other schools, or simply bad publicity.\" [14]\n \n \n Controversy\n As Pacific Western University, i.e., prior to changing its name to California Miramar University, the institution was criticized on multiple occasions as a substandard educational institution or diploma mill. [20]\n \n In May 2004 the US General Accounting Office presented the results of an eight-month examination of diploma mills and other unaccredited schools and federal employees holding their degrees to the U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs.[21] Pacific Western University in Los Angeles was one of the six schools on which the investigation focused.\n \n Later that year, investigative reporters from television station KVOA of Tucson, Arizona described the Los Angeles campus of Pacific Western University: \"We don't find students, classrooms or professors. Only a small office with two receptionists and a man who introduces himself as the dean.\"[22] KVOA noted that federal investigators had identified PWU as a diploma mill.[22][23] The station reported that Pima Community College in Tucson had reduced the salaries of two faculty members who previously had been paid at the Ph.D level based on their degrees from PWU.[22]\n \n Internationally, Pacific Western University has a similar reputation. It was reported in the Irish Independent on 9 October 2005 that the Chief Science Advisor to the government of Ireland, Barry McSweeney, had been found to have advanced his career using a suspect degree obtained from Pacific Western University.[24][25] The newspaper report stated that McSweeney had obtained his Ph.D. in biotechnology and biochemistry from PWU in 1994 after just 12 months of study. It described PWU as having \"no merit or standing in the academic world\" and having been \"the subject of numerous official investigations, state bans and media expos\u00e9s\" during its 28 years of operation.[24] McSweeney was forced to resign his position as a result.[26] In Australia, a lecturer at the University of Southern Queensland was banned from using the title of \"Doctor\" after it was discovered that his Ph.D. had been obtained from Pacific Western University.[27]",

Reardon, Ph.D.\n \n David C. Reardon, Ph.D., director of the Elliot Institute, is a biomedical ethicist and a leading expert on the aftereffects of abortion on women, a field in which he has specialized since 1983. He is the author of numerous books and popular and scholarly articles on this topic.\n His studies have been published in such prestigious medical journals as the the British Medical Journal and the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology and have proven that abortion compared to childbirth is associated with higher rates of maternal death, subsequent substance abuse, clinical depression, and psychiatric hospitalization.\n \n Articles about Dr. Reardon and his work have appeared in numerous magazines and newspapers, including NEWSWEEK and the NEW YORK TIMES. He is a frequent guest on Christian radio and Christian television talk shows and has been a frequently invited speaker state and national conventions for crisis pregnancy centers and pro-life organizations.\n \n Dr. Reardon's first book Aborted Women, Silent No More, published in 1987, became the best-selling book on abortion's impact on women over the course of the next fifteen years. It has been called \"the most powerful book ever written on abortion.\"\n \n His most recent book, Forbidden Grief: The Unspoken Pain of Abortion which he with co-authored with Dr. Theresa Burke, is the most comprehensive review of the impact of abortion on women available. It is a compelling revelation of the secrets post-abortive women tell only their therapists but want everyone to know. Reviewers are already hailing it as \"phenomenal\" and a \"classic.\"\n \n Dr. Reardon is also the author of Making Abortion Rare: A Healing Strategy for a Divided Nation (Acorn Books, 1996). Pro-life leaders have recommended it as compulsory reading for every pro-lifer who wants to know how abortion can be stopped in a way that is \"practical and realistic, but free of moral compromise.\" Dr. Reardon's three-pronged strategy for ending abortion by helping women has already been adopted by many pro-life organizations at the local, state, and national levels. It appears certain that the popularity of this new compassionate approach to the abortion conflict will continue to grow and become a permanent part of pro-life activities.\n \n As part of this strategy to end abortions which hurt women, Dr. Reardon has also authored The Jericho Plan: Breaking Down the Walls That Prevent Post-Abortion Healing. This is a resource book for post-abortion healing. It also serves as a sermon guide that helps ministers and clergy to address the abortion issue in a manner that reduces hostilities and promotes post-abortion healing. Most importantly, The Jericho Plan is helping pastors to overcome the fear of preaching on abortion. It is helping many pastors to break their silence and boldly preach a compassionate message that is truly both pro-life and pro-healing. \n \n In his work, Dr. Reardon has been the chief investigator on several original research projects. One of these was the first long-term follow-up study of a large number of women who had abortions an average of ten years previously. In a subsequent study of 700 randomly selected women, his research has shown that the women who aborted their first pregnancies were five times more likely to engage in subsequent abuse of drugs or alcohol compared to women who carried to term.\n \n In Victims and Victors: Speaking Out About Their Pregnancies, Abortions, and Children Resulting from Sexual Assault with Julie Makimaa and Amy Sobie, he compiled the witness and testimonies of 194 women who became pregnant following sexual assault. The nearly universal opinion of these women demonstrates that abortion is neither helpful nor necessary in cases of rape and incest, and in fact does far greater harm than good to these victims of sexual assault. He is also the editor of the Elliot Institute's quarterly publication, The Post-Abortion Review.",

   "Here's more on Reardon's accomplishments. \n\n \n Reardon has no accomplishments. He is a known con artist. \n \n \"Reardon also compared apples to oranges by not taking into account the \"wantedness\" of the pregnancy. When selecting comparison groups for studies, subjects should face similar predicaments with similar risk factors. But about half of all pregnancies brought to term are planned and wanted, while almost all abortions result from unintended pregnancies. Women who choose to deliver are more likely to feel emotionally and financially capable of raising a child, and be in a positive frame of mind about it. In contrast, experiencing an unintended pregnancy is often a traumatic experience, usually far more upsetting than the abortion itself, which actually relieves most women\".link",
