   "Macy's did the right thing  \n \n Macy's did the right thing. \n \n That's right. Macy's did the right thing. No, not when it took the mannequins out of its Gay Pride window. It did the right thing when it put them in. \n \n It did the right thing this week when its Chairman Ron Klein called the removal of the mannequins a \"mistake - unquestionably\" and said he was \"regretful\" over the action. \n \n It also did the right thing when it provided domestic partner health benefits to its gay employees in 1997. \n \n It did the right thing when it became a corporate sponsor of the AIDS Action Committee. \n \n It did the right thing in 2005 when it offered retiree health care benefits to same-sex partners of employees \n \n It did the right thing when it required all employees to attend sexual orientation diversity training. \n \n It did the right thing when it wrote sexual orientation into its employee non-discrimination policies. \n \n Macy's has done a lot of things right. \n \n But, Macy's also did something wrong. \n \n Macy's was wrong last week when it catered to the right-wing extremists at MassResistance (formerly Article 8 Alliance) in Massachusetts and removed two harmless mannequins wearing gay pride regalia. \n \n Macy's should put the mannequins back. And the gay community is right to demand that. But should we boycott the company? \n \n The Human Rights Campaign's (HRC) Corporate Equality Index (CEI) rates Macy's an 86 out of a possible 100 points. That rates very high. That's the same rank as the gay-friendly Wainwright Bank, which the Greater Boston Business Council (GBBC), Massachusetts' largest GLBT chamber of commerce, has honored many times with its Large Business award. That's the same rating as Time Warner, Disney and Anheuser-Busch. \n \n If, because of the Macy's window decision, HRC were to deem Macy's guilty of engaging in \"corporate action that would undermine the goal of equal rights [for] GLBT people,\" then Macy's score would fall to 71. which is Coca-Cola's score. \n \n If we want to boycott Macy's, are we willing to give up Coke as well? \n \n And how many of those who are cutting up their Macy's credit cards are still buying ExxonMobil gas, which has a dismal HRC CEI rating of 14? In fact the only thing ExxonMobil has done right in the list of things that Macy's has done right, is to provide sexual orientation diversity training. ExxonMobil provides no domestic partner health benefits, no non-discrimination policy, no AIDS Action Committee sponsorship, and certainly no mannequins wearing gay pride outfits in its storefronts! \n \n Yes, Macy's did the wrong thing, and they've received many, many phone calls and e-mails to let them know that. But how many phone calls and e-mails has Macy's, or any other corporation for that matter, received for doing the right thing? \n \n Gay activism should not be limited to protesting. \n \n Sure, money talks, and protests are heard. But gratitude also speaks volumes. \n \n Kudos to HRC and other gay rights advocacy groups for not knee-jerk reacting to Macy's regrettable decision in the same way that they did with Ford when they publicly blasted the HRC CEI 100-rated auto maker for removing ads from gay publications. \n \n Activism should not be all or nothing. \n \n Keep Macy's window decision in perspective, both with the retailer's other decisions, and with the decisions of other companies. \n \n Boycotting something of real substance is a lot different than boycotting window dressing. \u0095\n http://www.innewsweekly.com/innews/?class_code=Op&article_code=2108",
