   "According to a July Pew Research Center poll, 65 percent of Americans did not want to see Roe overturned, compared with 29 percent who wanted it gone. And only 9 percent thought abortion should be illegal in all cases.\n \n Most Americans agree that the procedure should be available in cases of rape and incest or when the mother's health or life is in danger. More are comfortable with abortion early on. The later in the term, and the more viable the fetus, the more uncomfortable Americans get. Most believe that 12-year-olds and women who refuse to use birth control should not be able to get abortions at will.\n\n \n Most Americans believe that 12 year olds should not be able to get abortions at will? Does that mean that they need parental consent? I'll go along with that. But what if it means that 12 year olds should be forced to carry a pregnancy? For those of you who believe this, please help me understand why. Thanks!\n \n And how is someone going to prove that a woman refuses birth control?\n \n Also, I did not think that Fox News was...well, considered a reliable source of information for some people.",
