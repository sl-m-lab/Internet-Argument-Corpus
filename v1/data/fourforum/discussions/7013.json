   "Clearly, a designer is the better explanation.\n\n \n Except that it isn't an explanation, it's a faith-based decision to stop seeking one.\n \n I've read several posts insisting that ID ought to be given equal weight as a science, all with a disarmingly plaintive rationale, the value of which can be summarised neatly by the following conversation:\n \n A: ID is a science!\n B: No it isn't.\n A: It would be if you'd let us redefine 'science'.\n \n and by observing that the same conversation could be held on the subject of, say, a dog and a rock.\n \n Before I get to the meat of the topic I would like first to discuss - if you are amenable - the motives behind the desire to encroach ID onto scientific territory, the reasons why it must surely fail, and - most importantly - the reason why the effort itself is unnecessary.\n \n I read a post elsewhere on this forum, from another quite eloquent creationist, stating that science begins with the assumption that God does not exist. This is a common misconception, clearly false when one considers the number of devout scientists in the world, but you can see within it the motive for attempting to 'sciencify' religion: \"If we can't teach religion in schools, we can at least teach God-friendly science\".\n \n However, scientific investigation of the natural world does not disallow God; it only requires that we do not invoke him - or any other magical replacements for explanations - unnecessarily or arbitrarily. Ever. That is rigorous science. Putting it another way, science assumes that God's existence is not dependent upon our belief in him. We don't get to choose where God fits in; if he is involved, it will be evident from our observations.\n \n For ID, or Creationism, to be classified as a science, the entrance requirements would have to be substantially relaxed - relaxed to the point where the word loses its usefulness as a description of a philosophy. ID allows us to invoke God - regardless of whether a naturalistic explanation exists or might be found - if an ancient book or a nice, well-meaning man in a dog-collar says we should, Any fair-minded appraisal of the umpteen-hundred extant religions in the world cannot but interpret this as 'if you feel like it'. Contrast that with the existence of a single, globally accepted definition of what constitutes science and the difference leaps into even sharper relief.\n \n Take a (perhaps) simpler and less emotive subject: gravity. We still don't know exactly what it is or how it works, but we do know an awful lot about how it seems to behave and have made some very useful predictions based on our theories. Even if, in the end, God made gravity, we are still much better off for having explored naturalistic explanations than if we had simply decreed: 'God made the apple fall'. Should we stop looking now? Or press on, as far as our ingenuity will take us? \n \n It is telling indeed that ID/Creationism tell us to 'stop looking' more or less exactly at the point where our investigations begin to threaten the veracity of a certain book. It is difficult to see any other, objective reason for abandoning naturalism at this specific time in these specific fields of research.\n \n ID and evolutionary science ask the same question: how did such complex beings as ourselves arise naturally? Except that ID asks it rhetorically, appealing to our incredulity and dislike of ignorance, and hiding behind our inability to truly apprehend the depth of time and quantities of matter evolution has had to work with. Only science is genuinely looking for an answer - hence the opening line of this post. For this simplest of reasons, amongst others, ID can never be called a science.\n \n But should it even be applying for the position? \n \n Science is the search for natural explanations. But if there are none - if the bible is right - science will fail. All on its own.\n \n Look back through history. Has religion, or science itself been the more effective at overthrowing scientific theories? Newtonian dynamics: a staggering mental achievement - superceded. Geocentricity, Heliocentricity - tossed aside, and these are just the obvious lay-examples. Science needs no help from religion to beat itself up. All the more reason to respect the battle-weary theories that survive!\n \n So why try to dress dogma up as science and join the party just to spoil it? Science is brutally honest with itself - in the long run, once personal investment in a theory has run its course, usually when the proponent dies and ambitious youngsters take over. And science has done pretty well; it may not have fed the five thousand, but it has made the world capable of feeding and healing the five billion. In case you're wondering, the other one billion are starving and dying at the moment, and could really use our help.\n \n But that's another argument.\n \n Right now we're searching for a mechanism that could turn slime and a few billion years into a creature capable of arguing on the internet, because the evidence we have seems to point to that being what has happened. We have a very promising lead that we call 'evolution', and we're working on refining it. Maybe we'll find a complete answer - or maybe we're on a wild-goose-chase; maybe we're looking for integer solutions of X^n + Y^n = Z^n where n < 2. If we are, we'll never find a solution, and sooner or later someone will prove the evolutionary equivalent of Fermat's Last Theorem, and we'll have found God.\n \n And at that moment we will, genuinely, have found him, not just closed our eyes and declared he is in front of us.\n \n Now, to return to the specific issue under discussion:\n \n \nYet, another explanation for the incredible similarity between the two structures exists: common design, instead of common descent. Any good engineer will use the same design more than once.\n\n \n This is perfectly true - for human engineers in the right circumstances. However, human limitations cannot possibly apply to an omnipotent deity. For any God worth mentioning it would be no greater an exertion to design independently perfect fore and aft limbs than it would be to reuse his first 'good idea'. Do you prefer your God lazy, or unimaginative?\n \n \nFor example, the nuts and bolts on a Honda will also fit on a Chevy. Is this because the Honda and Chevy evolved from a common ancestor? No, of course not. It is because the idea of a \"nut\" and \"bolt\" is a good one and was implemented by the designer. The same logic applies well to the limbs on mammals.\n\n \n Actually it is a quite terrible analogy in this context. For one, nuts and bolts in a car are far more aptly likened to ligaments holding muscle to bone - a trick that has, as you would expect with common ancestry, been replicated across the animal kingdom regardless of gross form. Even more catastrophically, the analogy abandons the original ID argument (fore and aft limbs being similar) in favour of comparing similarities across species (nuts and bolts found in different cars). Since the theory of evolution was predicated on that very discovery of 'nuts and bolts' in 'different cars', it is pretty clear this analogy has wandered into the wrong part of town.\n \n A far better analogy would be to compare fore and aft suspension in the same car - and here we find that the intervention of an intelligent creator, far from ensuring homology, often results in entirely different fore/aft configurations depending upon the purpose of the vehicle.\n \n I believe I have answered the point quite thoroughly; I would be obliged if the OP could do the same concerning the vestigial eyes of mole-rats. These creatures, existing forever in darkness, are entirely blind - their eyes are actually beneath their skin and quite useless - yet eyes they have. Perhaps someone could explain to my satisfaction why an intelligent designer would create such a creature.",

   "Let's start with these facts, that help show the similarity between the arms and the legs of a single organism, as well as similarity between the limbs of different vertebrates, as well as the ability of vertebrate limb buds to produce normal limbs when grafted onto embryos of different types of vertebrates: all just as evolution would predict.\n \n \n\"The bones of any vertebrate limb, be it arm or leg, wing or flipper, consist of a proximal stylopod (humerus/femur) adjacent to the body wall; a zeugopod (radius-ulna/tibia-fibula) in the middle region; and a distal autopod (carpals-fingers/tarsals-toes). ... since the limbs, unlike the heart or brain, are not essential for embryonic or fetal life, one can experimentally remove or transplant parts of the developing limb, or create limb-specific mutants without interfering with the vital processes of the organism. Such experiments have shown that the basic 'morphogenetic rules' for forming a limb appear to be the same in all tetrapods. Grafted pieces of reptile or mammalian limb buds can direct the formation of chick limbs, and regions of frog limb buds can direct the patterning of salamander limbs.\" (Developmental Biology: Seventh Edition, Scott F.

   "Essentially, by ruling out the unintelligent processes, we affirm the ID theory.\n\n \n At one point in history, we had no idea how snowflakes were formed. It seemed incredible that such symmetrical structures could occur naturally. But because no religious text (that I'm aware of) made any specific mention of snowflakes, we were free to assume - correctly - that there was a naturalistic explanation that happened to lie beyond our current ability to fathom.\n \n Evolution posits a similar situation: there is an explanation, we just don't know all the details yet. Considerable - some might say overwhelming - evidence indicates common ancestry. That descent with modification occurs, and that it can impact on the ability to reproduce, is obvious to anyone with one ugly daughter and one pretty one.\n \n Ah, but here religion does have a thing or two to say. We're supposed to be descended from a single happy couple who popped into existence a few thousand years ago, so we're not allowed to follow where the evidence for evolution leads us. Hence ID chooses to ignore the evidence as it mounts and mounts. ID chooses to equate a present lack of complete understanding with the impossibility of ever understanding, in the face of hundreds of years of scientific progress in general and genetics in particular.\n \n \nExactly why, apart from common design, would evolution make exactly five digits? Why not 3, or 6?\n\n \n And if there were 3, you would ask why not two, or four. And if there were different numbers of digits on hands and feet you would hold this up as evidence of a designer creating bespoke limbs.\n \n But OK, let's pretend you bothered to answer my post and run with this bizarre, tunnel-vision 'evidence' for ID.\n \n Examining all mammalian appendages we see a great deal of commonality; one basic design being adapted to fulfil a huge variety of purposes. This is exactly congruent with evolution. An omnipotent designer would have complete freedom to create any configuration of tissue he liked when creating a hamster's leg, or a cat's, or a human's. Such a designer would not have needed to put those awkward, useless thumbs halfway up a dog's leg, or go to such lengths to make a horse's hoof a distorted and fused 'foot'.\n \n When considering the process of evolution and the notion of 'fittest', it is a mistake to think only in terms of a final, static product. A mammalian limb or body - the generic, common structure - is not merely 'fit' for a particular purpose, it is exceptionally fit for the purpose of further adaptation to circumstance. It has evolved not just to be a certain shape, but to be genetically sensitive to environmental changes. It's easy to see why: limb types that were not amenable to relatively rapid and extreme genetic adaptation would likely have resulted in dead-end evolutionary paths long ago: creatures superbly adapted to the present but unable to roll with the punches. One need only observe the extreme ease and rapidity with which dogs can be bred to suit a purpose to understand how mutable mammalian forms can be, and what an asset that is - even in the absence of whimsical human intelligence - in a changeable environment.\n \n What do I mean by 'genetically sensitive'? Example: there is a protein - forgive me for forgetting its name - whose job it is to ensure our DNA and RNA is reproduced precisely. It is very, very good at its job, and when the parent organism is healthy and happy, it is free to get on with its work. But if the parent organism is stressed, hungry, too hot, too cold - in some way unhappy with its lot, this protein gets hijacked to perform other tasks, and a rather more slovenly, second-rate protein takes its place, resulting in greater genetic deviance. No doubt there are endless, finer subtleties involved. \n \n So even if we were designed, we were clearly designed to evolve. Which enables the question: what from? How far have we come? Evidence indicates we were certainly something else before we were Homo Sapiens Sapiens; no appeal to incredulity over the complexity of a cell will stop us being the offspring of clever apes. Are there gaps on the way back to primordial slime? Undoubtedly. Will we find God in one of them? Perhaps; we don't know. But to say here and now that 'ID is the only answer' when we can discern the shadowy outlines of so many natural wonders and mysteries is, I maintain, wilful, dogmatic ignorance.",

   "Just because evolution were to be proved false, that still does not mean cretion as you see it. There are still other possibilities, not just the two. How about aliens - they are always overlooked.\n\n \n Where did the aliens come from?\n \n \nAt one point in history, we had no idea how snowflakes were formed. It seemed incredible that such symmetrical structures could occur naturally. But because no religious text (that I'm aware of) made any specific mention of snowflakes, we were free to assume - correctly - that there was a naturalistic explanation that happened to lie beyond our current ability to fathom.\n \n Evolution posits a similar situation: there is an explanation, we just don't know all the details yet. Considerable - some might say overwhelming - evidence indicates common ancestry. That descent with modification occurs, and that it can impact on the ability to reproduce, is obvious to anyone with one ugly daughter and one pretty one.\n \n Ah, but here religion does have a thing or two to say. We're supposed to be descended from a single happy couple who popped into existence a few thousand years ago, so we're not allowed to follow where the evidence for evolution leads us. Hence ID chooses to ignore the evidence as it mounts and mounts. ID chooses to equate a present lack of complete understanding with the impossibility of ever understanding, in the face of hundreds of years of scientific progress in general and genetics in particular.\n\n \n This argument is fundamentally flawed. You see, when we had no idea how snow flakes were formed, it was due to lack of information. The argument that I am presenting now, however, is firmly based upon what we do know. In other words, not know how snow flakes form is due to lack of information. Knowing that Darwinian evolution cannot, within any reasonable probability, the incredible similarity between arms and legs is based firmly in information that has been gained.\n \n Furthermore, even if you are correct about information gained/unknowns, how do you know that the reverse is not true? Perhaps there is an intelligent designer after all, and you, because of your lack of information, are attributing everything to chance.\n \n \nAn omnipotent designer would have complete freedom to create any configuration of tissue he liked when creating a hamster's leg, or a cat's, or a human's.\n\n \n And perhaps a limb is simply the best design for the environment that God gave us. Can you make it better?\n \n \nSuch a designer would not have needed to put those awkward, useless thumbs halfway up a dog's leg, or go to such lengths to make a horse's hoof a distorted and fused 'foot'.\n\n \n You are going to have to explain further exactly what you are saying here, since I am not sure exactly why you believe that those designs are flawed and what the flawed parts of the designs you are referring to are.\n \n \nWhen considering the process of evolution and the notion of 'fittest', it is a mistake to think only in terms of a final, static product. A mammalian limb or body - the generic, common structure - is not merely 'fit' for a particular purpose, it is exceptionally fit for the purpose of further adaptation to circumstance. It has evolved not just to be a certain shape, but to be genetically sensitive to environmental changes. It's easy to see why: limb types that were not amenable to relatively rapid and extreme genetic adaptation would likely have resulted in dead-end evolutionary paths long ago: creatures superbly adapted to the present but unable to roll with the punches. One need only observe the extreme ease and rapidity with which dogs can be bred to suit a purpose to understand how mutable mammalian forms can be, and what an asset that is - even in the absence of whimsical human intelligence - in a changeable environment.\n\n \n I am not exactly sure what you are saying here. If you are saying that some homologies can be explained by evolution, I agree. The problem comes when we ask why some homologies exist that supposedly evolved separately from each other.\n \n \n1) Why did God originally design tetrapods with up to 8 digits if His design plan was for 5?\n\n \n Because having multiple digits is a good design. He also designed jelly fish, elephants, and lions - each of which is also a good design. I thought that was rather obvious. \n \n \n2) Why did God plant evidences completely consistent with evolution?\n\n \n He didn't. Darwin interpreted God's creation in a way that he believed to be consistent with macroevolution. \n \n \n3) Who said tetrapods all have 5 digits?\n\n \n I don't believe that anyone made that claim. I was under the impression that that was roughly the case until recently. In any case, it hardly effects the argument at hand. (that is, why hands and feet both have the same number) Says Denton:\n \n \"It seems very unlikely that there could be any adaptive necessity that dictates that there be five digits in both hands and foot or that the thumb and big toe be both made of tow phalanges, that the forearm and lower leg be made of two long bones or that there be only one bone in the upper arm and leg.\"\n \n \nPerhaps you should learn some science and evolution before claiming they are bogus!!\n\n \n Perhaps you should be polite until you have figured out my argument. emoticon_rolleyes",

Why not 3, or 6?\n\n \n I pointed out that in fact evolution HAS made tetrapods with 3 digits, and other tetrapods with 6 digits, as well as tetrapods with 8 digits and 1 digit.\n \n And even in humans polydactyl individuals (with extra fingers and/or toes) occur. In fact, my niece is married to someone who's father or mother has an extra finger.\n \n Now, why would humans have 5 fingers and 5 toes, usually? Because the common ancestor we share with chimps - which also have 5 fingers and 5 toes - did. Evolution explains our 5 digits quite nicely, despite your uninformed assertions.\n \n \n \nThe Skeptic: Says Denton:\n \n \"It seems very unlikely that there could be any adaptive necessity that dictates that there be five digits in both hands and foot or that the thumb and big toe be both made of tow phalanges, that the forearm and lower leg be made of two long bones or that there be only one bone in the upper arm and leg.\"\n \n\n \n There's a quite straightforward evolutionary explanation for why our stylopods have only one bone, and our zeugopods have two: because our ancestors did. \n \n Although not believed to be a direct ancestor of humans, Acanthostega had only one bone in its upper legs and two bones in its lower. So too did Seymouria, and Tulerpton. Having one upper and two lower limb bones seems to have been the rule for Devonian tetrapods, not the exception.\n \n There's also an Evo Devo explanation for why tetrapod forelimbs and hindlimbs share so many similarities: because the same genes are involved in their embryonic development, just as would be expected for serially repeated structures. \n \n \n \n \n ******************************************\n \n Now, I thought you claimed there was no evidence for homology other than the mere pre-assumption of evolutionary relatedness. I've shown such an assertion to be flat out wrong.\n \n \nSuch experiments have shown that the basic 'morphogenetic rules' for forming a limb appear to be the same in all tetrapods. Grafted pieces of reptile or mammalian limb buds can direct the formation of chick limbs, and regions of frog limb buds can direct the patterning of salamander limbs. (Developmental Biology: Seventh Edition, Scott F. Gilbert, Sinauer Associates Inc., 2003, p523, 524)\n\n \n \nAlthough the limbs of different vertebrates differ with respect to the somite level at which they arise, their position is constant with respect to the level of Hox gene expression along the anterior-posterior axis. For instance, in fish (in which the pectoral and pelvic fins correspond to the anterior and posterior limbs, respectively), amphibians, birds, and mammals, the forelimb buds are found at the most anterior expression region of Hoxc-6, the position of the first thoracic vertebra. (Developmental Biology: Seventh Edition, Scott F. Gilbert, Sinauer Associated Inc, p525) \n\n \n We have genetic and experimental confirmation of the great similarity of limb development across tetrapods, exactly as expected for evolution. And of course, this broad generality of embryonic development that confirms evolution extends to many other structures than just limbs, such as eye development and so on.\n \n And you haven't explained yet how God is a better explanation for the evolution of autopods than evolution itself is.\n \n \n\"The discovery of a [fossil] fish with fingers illustrates that intermediate forms do exist in the fossil record, but it does take a combination of skill, patience, and great luck to find the gems (the best Sauripteris fossil limb was only discovered in the mid-1990s in a Pennsylvania road cut).\n \n Acanthostega, which appeared a bit later than Sauripteris, had four legs, but these could not support the animal's body weight and many features of the limb and body were still fishlike.

   "Any good engineer will use the same design more than once.\n\n \n No, any good HUMAN engineer would. \n \n Humans have limited time, limited knowledge, limited finances, and avoid working harder than they have to. Therefore, we reuse preexisting designs: it's quick, it's easy, it reduces buggy products, and it requires less or little thought. Obviously, with all of these benefits, reuse of working designs is a good choice for LIMITED beings, such as us humans. \n \n But to say that this applies equally to a supposed all-knowing, all-powerful, eternal supernatural being is ad hoc to say the least. We shouldn't expect God to be looking to do things quickly (He has always existed, and will always exist) or easily (He is all-powerful so nothing is any more difficult for Him to do than anything else), or be worried about avoiding bugs in His designs (He is all-knowing and all-powerful after all, so His designs shouldn't be buggy anyway) or trying to think as little as possible (He is all-knowing, so no type of thought is more difficult for Him). \n \n So this attempt to analogize the Designer God's practices to mere human designers' practices simply doesn't hold up. It is just another flawed analogy, which is essentially all that Intelligent Design Creationism ever comes up with.\n \n On the other hand, reuse of preexisting 'designs' is EXACTLY what we expect from evolution.

   "Knowing that Darwinian evolution cannot, within any reasonable probability, [explain] the incredible similarity between arms and legs is based firmly in information that has been gained.\n\n \n Interesting. Presumably you're remembering to include information such as evidence that fore and aft limbs once served near-identical purposes. That our arms and legs are similar is precisely consistent with a descent from apes, creatures whose four limbs perform much more similar tasks. It would be strong evidence against such an ancestry if our arms and legs were entirely different in design.\n \n Your argument is a proof by elimination: \"It could not happen by chance, so the only alternative is intelligent design.\" Yet you ignore the multitude of far more direct proofs by elimination that discount ID. I mentioned one in an earlier post: the vestigial eyes of the mole-rat. There is no conceivable ID-based explanation for the creation of such a creature. Since you have disposed of accident, and I have disposed of design, that leaves us in something of a pickle!\n \n \nFurthermore, even if you are correct about information gained/unknowns, how do you know that the reverse is not true? Perhaps there is an intelligent designer after all, and you, because of your lack of information, are attributing everything to chance.\n\n \n I quote myself:\n \n \nAre there gaps on the way back to primordial slime? Undoubtedly. Will we find God in one of them? Perhaps; we don't know.\n\n \n Lacking complete knowledge, I cannot rule out the eventual discovery of an inexplicable evolutionary gap. But limb similarity isn't it, as I and several others have demonstrated.\n \n The problem with ID isn't that it postulates a designer, but that it is hijacked by people with a pre-existing agenda for where in history that designer has to be shoe-horned in, regardless of evidence to the contrary. That's what stops it being a science. You could say to me 'The cell is too complex to have evolved by chance' and right now I would have no direct proof to the contrary. But the evidence that we descended from apes is quite overwhelming; ID can't begin to make a dent in it. As an 'ID scientist', therefore, you ought to be concentrating your investigations on the genuine evidential gaps, hundreds of millions of years ago. Are you prepared to go where the science leads you, or are you just trying to prop up your religious beliefs?\n \n Note: The evidence that it apparently took around two billion years for an entire planet steeped in living slime to come up with the cell, and a further one and a half billion years for them to learn to work together is at least consistent with our observation that it seems very, very unlikely. If we had direct evidence that multicellular organisms sprang effortlessly out of the dust in a couple of days, that would be a different matter entirely.\n \n \nAnd perhaps a limb is simply the best design for the environment that God gave us. Can you make it better?\n\n \n What do my personal abilities have to do with anything? Can you make a better snowflake?\n \n Arms and legs being grossly similar but subtly specialised is entirely consistent with a form of life (mammalian) that over time has changed and adapted and speciated to fill a multitude of niches and survive countless global catastrophes, and will continue to do so. It prepares us for the future, whereas grossly different or overly specialised bespoke limbs would have a much harder job adapting to a changing environment, and would be strong evidence for ID and against common ancestry.\n \n But if we were created 'as God intended', why all this genetic adaptability? Why a fossil record outlining an evolutionary ancestry? Is it really so optimal for every mammal to have seven neck vertebrae? Or is it, like our appendix, just something not important enough for evolution to bother changing?\n \n \nYou are going to have to explain further exactly what you are saying here, since I am not sure exactly why you believe that those designs are flawed and what the flawed parts of the designs you are referring to are.\n\n \n All these limbs are very clearly the best you can get (future evolution notwithstanding) if you take a common ancestral limb and gradually deform it in different ways. A designer wouldn't have to do that. Even if a hoof is the best possible solution for a horse, he wouldn't need to make one out of fused toes, and he certainly wouldn't need to fill the ground with fossils indicating how that fusing process progressed over millions of years. Evolution, on the other hand, would. Does that illuminate the point satisfactorily?\n \n \nI don't believe that anyone made that claim. I was under the impression that that was roughly the case until recently. In any case, it hardly effects the argument at hand. (that is, why hands and feet both have the same number) Says Denton:\n \n \"It seems very unlikely that there could be any adaptive necessity that dictates that there be five digits in both hands and foot or that the thumb and big toe be both made of tow phalanges, that the forearm and lower leg be made of two long bones or that there be only one bone in the upper arm and leg.\"\n\n \n Clearly Denton didn't know about creatures with eight fingers and seven toes either. \n \n His argument ignores ancestral common purpose, and fails to rationalise why an omnipotent designer would choose and re-use that particular configuration rather than create bespoke limbs. Hardly surprising, since that would involve an impossible proof that no bespoke configuration could be superior in a non-evolving organism.\n \n I, on the other hand, can give concrete examples of what a designer could have done differently: construct hooves as a finished unit, and avoided seeding the earth with intermediate fossils. I can also argue that adapted, generic limbs ARE superior to bespoke limbs in an evolving organism and support that argument with evidence.",

   "Like I said before, the supporters of evolution are as closeminded as the supporters of creationism. You people really deserve eachother.\n\n \n Can a person be closeminded about evolution? Of course! He can hear the basics, adopt a pro stance, and refuse to even debate the issue, regardless of what difficulties are encountered. But that's a personal choice, and isn't mandated by the theory itself. Science has achieved its best results from people challenging the established order.\n \n Religious dogma, on the other hand, deliberately fosters closemindedness. It tells adherents they should rejoice when others scoff at them. It even launches pre-emptive strikes in case any contradictory evidence turns up, by telling the devout that their faith will be tested. If a car salesman told you \"Whatever other people say, and however often it breaks down, this car is the best\", would you fall for it? Maybe he would have more luck if he prepended the words \"According to God...\" to his spiel :)\n \n What's almost amusing about ID is how childishly transparent a deception it is. Clearly, they don't make religious philosophers like they used to:\n \n \"No, no, we really ARE scientists. We have beards and labcoats and everything, and we are independently convinced by real evidence in the real world that this book, called the 'bible', with which we are not affiliated in any way, is a factual account of events. Provided you ignore a few contradictions in Genesis and interpret what remains extremely liberally. We've heard about this relativity thing and how time isn't constant, so that means everything really could have been made in six days and existed for a few thousand years, and anyway you can't prove isotopic decay has always been constant, even though a historical rate of the magnitude required for a biblical earth would have killed us all instantly and left the planet an incandescent ball of rock-vapour. It's science, so please let us teach it to impressionable kids, because we're scared they won't believe our holy book if you don't. Damn! I wasn't supposed to say that!\"\n \n There are far more bizarre and problematic theories than evolution out there. It has famously been said that if you don't find quantum mechanics deeply offensive, you haven't understood it properly. But single electrons really do interfere with themselves in double-slit experiments. Relativity is pretty uncomfortable too, when you look at what it actually implies about the nature of reality and simultaneity. Part of my time axis is in your spacial axes, and vice versa. I can't travel into my own future, but I can travel into yours and you can travel into mine - so who exactly are we going to meet? Hell, the two theories flat-out contradict each other, yet they both yield observationally verifiable results! Talk about an easy target; where are the 'Intelligent Physics' brigade?\n \n But neither of these theories say we descended from apes millions of years ago, so they're OK :)",

What I'm looking for are the missing links that connect the two species.\n \n \n\n \n Well, not quite. The difference between archaic man and modern man is not \n as drastic as you might imagine. If you did a bone by bone comparison, you would not that there are the same number of bones, arrainged in the same pattern. The main difference would be in the width of the bones, and some \n modifications in the joints (although the knee joint of an archaic man is very close to modern man.) There is also a difference in the eye ridges, and in the brain cavities. \n \n One point I will make is the concept of the 'Missing LInk' is not a valid one.\n All fossils are transitional.. If we find a fossil that is between the fossil we think is related to the first modern man,then that would create two 'missing links' . You will also have to remember that the archaic hominids (Homo heidelbergensis) and the early homo sapiens overlapped each other in time frame.\n \n There is no clear dividing line between late erectus and early archaic.\n \n One interesting paragraph found on talk origins about hominid evolution is\n \n\n Even within the last 100,000 years, the long-term trends towards smaller molars and decreased robustness can be discerned. The face, jaw and teeth of Mesolithic humans (about 10,000 years ago) are about 10% more robust than ours. Upper Paleolithic humans (about 30,000 years ago) are about 20 to 30% more robust than the modern condition in Europe and Asia. These are considered modern humans, although they are sometimes termed \"primitive\". Interestingly, some modern humans (aboriginal Australians) have tooth sizes more typical of archaic sapiens. The smallest tooth sizes are found in those areas where food-processing techniques have been used for the longest time. This is a probable example of natural selection which has occurred within the last 10,000 years (Brace 1983).\n \n\n \n \n\n II.\n \n Not all species evolve into the next step. For example, not all fish crawled out of the sea and grew legs because we still have fish in the sea today. Likewise not all monkeys evolved into man-apes because we still have many species of monkeys running around today.\n So we can assume that not all man-apes evolved into the next step etc.\n So why do we still have monkeys around today when the superior Homo habilis, Neanderthals etc. are nowhere to be found? Shouldn't these superior creatures be more likely to be around because they're higher on the evolutionary ladder (survival of the fittest and all)?\n \n \n If you could explain this to me it would be much appreciated.\n\n \n First of all, you are assuming that evolution has a direction. There is no such thing as a 'superior' or 'inferior' species. There are just species that are adapted to a different environment better. You are assuming that if there is a \n divergence, that one is 'superior' than another. Monkeys are around today because when the common ancestors split their populations into two different \n groups... one that went into one environment, another that went into a different environment. Sometimes, a population will get seperate from the \n majority, and due to genetic isolation and environmental pressures, will adapt to a different ecological niche. The 'parent' population did not go exinct, but the 'daughter' species was isolated from it, and therefore genetic drift happened to the point it could not interbreed with the 'parent' population. A modern example of this would be the Faero Island Mouse. This mouse has developed into a new species due to isolation, even though it was introduced to Faero Island (from boats of man) less than 250 years ago.\n \n \n The reason Neadnerthal went extinct while monkeys didn't is that apparently, the neaderthal was in competition with the same resources as modern man and modern man was a bit more adaptable. They have discovered (through corpolites) that the diet of the neanderthal was strictly red meat, probably from large game animals, while the diet of the cro-magnon was much more varied. \n \n The concept of the 'evolutionary ladder' is misleading. It is assuming that later specimens are 'superior' to the older ones.. while it is just that they are adapted to different environments. \n \n The term 'Survivial of the fittest' really isn't an evolutionary concept. It was coined by William Spencer, who mainly used it for as 'social darwinism'. The only 'fittest' that evolution actually matters the the one more able to pass on the genes to the next generation. That sometimes means stronger. That sometimes means being able to digest different foods.. and sometimes just plain luck.",

   "A couple of genuinely interesting and thoughtful questions here:\n \n \nEvolution is based on the idea that life evolves slowly over a very long period of time. Fish didn't just crawl out of the sea and grew legs overnight for example.\n \n If you look at the different stages of human evolution you'll see that there are vast differences between the species. The step between Homo sapiens (archaic) and the next step, modern man, is considerable (different skeleton etc.).\n I would expect that in accordance with the evolutionary theory that there would be a slow very gradual evolution towards modern man, but the only thing I see is a rather large and quick step (by evolutionary standards) .\n Am I to believe that one day a Homo sapiens (archaic) gave birth to modern man? What I'm looking for are the missing links that connect the two species.\n \n\n \n One contributing factor, if not a complete explanation, is the rarity of fossil formation. Dinosaurs were undoubtedly very numerous, so the reason we're not up to our armpits in Tyrannosaur skulls is that perhaps one bone in a billion actually falls in the right environment to become fossilized. To put things in perspective, if everyone on the planet died right now, the global fossil record for the entire homo sapiens sapiens species would be somewhat less than a thousand bones - not skeletons, bones. A thousand bones, somewhere on the planet. It's entirely possible that some visiting alien race ten million years from now could find evidence for our civilisation (probably nuclear material) but have no idea what we looked like.\n \n And that's with over six billion of us. With a historical global population of a million at most, the patchiness of the fossil record of our ancestors becomes a little less inexplicable. The only reason we find anything at all is the tremendous timescales involved (this is, incidentally, further evidence of a very old earth; it's inconceivable that we could find the observed combination of variety and scarcity of fossilized remains on a 10,000 year old planet)\n \n \nNot all species evolve into the next step. For example, not all fish crawled out of the sea and grew legs because we still have fish in the sea today. Likewise not all monkeys evolved into man-apes because we still have many species of monkeys running around today.\n So we can assume that not all man-apes evolved into the next step etc.\n So why do we still have monkeys around today when the superior Homo habilis, Neanderthals etc. are nowhere to be found? Shouldn't these superior creatures be more likely to be around because they're higher on the evolutionary ladder (survival of the fittest and all)?\n\n \n This is a little less straightforward to explain, but still logically consistent. \n \n What happens to any predatory species when they compete directly for resources? One of them tends to lose. Look at the big cats in Africa. No two species share a niche, but there are still several varieties of big cat around, because they are each specialists. They don't like each other much, but the smaller, quicker ones are able to escape from the larger, more powerful ones, and they eat different food, so the fortunes of one species don't always impact the others. They can coexist.\n \n This of course begs the question: how can divergence occur at all, if similar creatures tend to compete until the weaker is extinct? Wouldn't that imply that evolution tends to keep species homogeonous? Well, remember that it's not just the predators that share common ancestry. Their different shapes today are a direct consequence of the different ways herbivores have successfully evolved to avoid being eaten quite so often. \n \n Rudimentary example: start with generic predators and prey, with a little random variation from creature to creature. The slimmest and quickest examples of the prey tend to survive better, as do the heaviest and most powerful. Inheritable variation means that their genes tend to prevail.\n \n Since there are always far more prey than predators, the fastest examples of the predators have plenty to eat, as do the strongest. Fast breeding with fast does very well, as does strong breeding with strong. Fast breeding with strong blunts both edges and doesn't work so well. Fifty thousand generations later, that translates to the tendency to breed fast with fast and strong with strong being advantageous. Although fast could still breed with strong at this point, such offspring would not often survive, and so evolution favours the genes that never even consider it. Eventually the genetic gulf can become so great that it is physically impossible for them to interbreed, and we have speciation.\n \n So what about us?\n \n Well, because we depend on brains and tools instead of physical attributes to obtain our resources, our resource niche doesn't change: it only expands. We figure out how to kill both the fast AND the strong. As soon as this process began, presumably soon after we split from the apes that survive today, divergent speciation could no longer occur: we never stopped competing. Stronger and Faster are two viable parallel evolutionary routes; Smart and Stupid are not. Plus we're almost uniquely able to consciously understand the concept of 'competition' and imagine a world without it. A lion is happy enough to just chase a leopard off its patch, whereas we are smart enough to hunt it down and kill it so that nobody can chase it back. So the most likely answer to your question is: nothing more closely related to us than chimps survives today because we kicked their asses.",

   "Not all species evolve into the next step...\n\n \n Trebor and Peeling have already done a thorough job here, but I'll add one further footnote. It's a very common misconception among non-biologists that the 'next step' in a species' evolution is in some way prefigured or pre-programmed: that, for examples, humans are inevitably destined to evolve bigger and bigger brains, until we reach the classic sci-fi comic-book picture of huge heads on tiny vestigial bodies. This misconception sees the emergence of humans from ape-like ancestors as similarly pre-destined - that earlier primates had some unwinding programme in them that was driving them toward human-ness.\n \n The reality is that no 'next step' exists in evolution, either for humans or other organisms. Instead, the environment changes in an essentially contingent manner: new opportunities arise for making a living, as do new constraints on previous ways. Selection operates on existing variation in species, and over time they change as a result - but the direction of the change was not predictable in advance.\n \n The harsh truth is that the existence of humans on our planet was never inevitable: we're here because purely contingent environmental changes in Africa some millions of years ago created a niche for opportunistic bipeds.",

   "Note: There has been a lot of posting since I last logged on. In order to keep this post at a manageable size, I sorted what I felt were to arguments from the rhetoric.\n \n \nNow, why would humans have 5 fingers and 5 toes, usually? Because the common ancestor we share with chimps - which also have 5 fingers and 5 toes - did. Evolution explains our 5 digits quite nicely, despite your uninformed assertions.\n\n \n \nThere's a quite straightforward evolutionary explanation for why our stylopods have only one bone, and our zeugopods have two: because our ancestors did.\n\n \n This simply moves the question back further: why did our common ancestor develop exactly five toes and fingers, along with all of the other similarities. Until you answer this question, you are simply trying to avoid the issue.\n \n \nThere's also an Evo Devo explanation for why tetrapod forelimbs and hindlimbs share so many similarities: because the same genes are involved in their embryonic development, just as would be expected for serially repeated structures.\n\n \n Exactly how would this work?\n \n \nWe have genetic and experimental confirmation of the great similarity of limb development across tetrapods, exactly as expected for evolution. And of course, this broad generality of embryonic development that confirms evolution extends to many other structures than just limbs, such as eye development and so on.\n\n \n Please explain your quotes further and exactly how they relate to the argument. Are you saying the embryonic development sequences match each other in an evolutionary way?\n \n \nThat BOTH our hands and feet have the same number is not really puzzling, since they BOTH are derived from legs of the earliest tetrapods: remember, they didn't have hands like us, and both of their limbs were much more nearly identical.\n\n \n Ah. Now you are missing the issue once again. Remember, 5/5 fingers/toes is simply an example, not the only similarity. You have, as of yet, presented no reason whatsoever that front and back fish fins would evolved into homologous bone structures.\n \n \nSo that only \"puzzle\" here is why evolution eventually found 5 digits for legs to be the best compromise - keeping in mind that evolution also produced other tetrapods with fewer than 5 digits. Here's a potential answer:\n\n \n And you then presented a quote saying essentially that 5 digits is a good design. Why, then, do other tetrapods not have 5 digits (or have more than 5)?\n \n \nAnd where does 'God' come from.\n \n Oh wait. You want to make a special pleding for god and call him 'eternal'.'\n\n \n All things that we observe around us have a cause. Therefore, something, which was not caused, must have started everything rolling at the beginning. This is God. We know that God does not require a cause because he exists outside of time. We know that because he created time in the first place. Naturalists think that the first cause was the Big Bang; I believe that it was God.\n \n \nHumans have limited time, limited knowledge, limited finances, and avoid working harder than they have to. Therefore, we reuse preexisting designs: it's quick, it's easy, it reduces buggy products, and it requires less or little thought. Obviously, with all of these benefits, reuse of working designs is a good choice for LIMITED beings, such as us humans. \n \n But to say that this applies equally to a supposed all-knowing, all-powerful, eternal supernatural being is ad hoc to say the least. We shouldn't expect God to be looking to do things quickly (He has always existed, and will always exist) or easily (He is all-powerful so nothing is any more difficult for Him to do than anything else), or be worried about avoiding bugs in His designs (He is all-knowing and all-powerful after all, so His designs shouldn't be buggy anyway) or trying to think as little as possible (He is all-knowing, so no type of thought is more difficult for Him). \n \n So this attempt to analogize the Designer God's practices to mere human designers' practices simply doesn't hold up. It is just another flawed analogy, which is essentially all that Intelligent Design Creationism ever comes up with.\n\n \n Strangely enough, that was exactly my thought when I first read about the common design argument. After giving it some thought, I came to these conclusions:\n \n 1. There are not an infinite number of possible designs that can exist in a finite universe.\n 2. Therefore, it is possible that God selected the best designs out of the finite number and occasionally used them more than once, not because he absolutely had to, but because it worked well, perhaps better than the alternatives.\n 3. Perhaps it simply pleased God to sometimes piece together different designs. Why not?\n 4. God also created many other designs, as can be seen in nature.\n \n \nFurther, assuming a common designer doesn't explain the common defects found in, say, chimps and humans, such as our multiple shared pseudogenes: some even with the exact same mutations that make them no longer functional. Well, common design by a COMPLETE IDIOT might! :-) Perhaps God is just an incompetent XXXXX?!?!?! Or maybe God is just another Great Deceiver, like Lucifer/Satan, and planted all sorts of false evidences in order to intentionally mislead scientists into believing evolution, so that He could then turn right around and condemn them to eternal damnation for falling prey to His trap?!?!?!\n \n On the other hand, evolution explains the shared genetic 'defects' (pseudogenes) quite nicely, in a completely non-ad hoc manner.\n\n \n This thread is not about pseudogenes - it is about unexplained homologies. Please don't hijack the thread. This argument has been addressed by Ashby Camp at: http://www.trueorigin.org/theobald1e.asp#pred20\n \n \nYour argument is a proof by elimination: \"It could not happen by chance, so the only alternative is intelligent design.\" Yet you ignore the multitude of far more direct proofs by elimination that discount ID. I mentioned one in an earlier post: the vestigial eyes of the mole-rat. There is no conceivable ID-based explanation for the creation of such a creature. Since you have disposed of accident, and I have disposed of design, that leaves us in something of a pickle!\n\n \n lol. Exactly why do you believe that creationism rules out harmful mutations? We live in a fallen world, and mutations are capable of making an unused organ useless. That a mutation disabled the eyes on the mole rat is perfectly consistent with creationism.\n \n \nWhat do my personal abilities have to do with anything? Can you make a better snowflake?\n\n \n If you do not see a better way to design it, how do you know a better way exists?\n \n \nArms and legs being grossly similar but subtly specialised is entirely consistent with a form of life (mammalian) that over time has changed and adapted and speciated to fill a multitude of niches and survive countless global catastrophes, and will continue to do so. It prepares us for the future, whereas grossly different or overly specialised bespoke limbs would have a much harder job adapting to a changing environment, and would be strong evidence for ID and against common ancestry.\n\n \n Arms and legs are both supposed to have evolved (separately) from the front and back fish fins. The fins on fish have essentially no structural similarity to our arms and legs. Thus, the arm/leg design is not a \"subtly specialized\" design. If you believe in evolution, you must believe that the front and back fins on a fish became so \"specialized\" that they developed into a homology. The homology was not there at the beginning. \n \n \nBut if we were created 'as God intended', why all this genetic adaptability? Why a fossil record outlining an evolutionary ancestry?\n\n \n First, exactly what do you mean by genetic adaptability? If by genetic adaptability, you mean that enough genetic adaptability exists to allow all life to have evolved from a common ancestor, I disagree. This is a hotly debated subject. If by genetic adaptability, you mean that God allowed genetic variation, it is clear that genetic variation allows life to exist everywhere on the planet. For example, because of variation, dogs can live almost everywhere on earth. \n \n Second of all, the fossil record in no way outlines an evolutionary ancestry. If evolution was correct, we would expect to find thousands of links between creatures currently observed and their distant ancestors. Instead, we only find a handful of arguable examples. I am sorry, but you are simply wrong.\n \n \nAll these limbs are very clearly the best you can get (future evolution notwithstanding) if you take a common ancestral limb and gradually deform it in different ways.\n\n \n Again, that is not what evolution claims. Evolution claims that the limbs evolved from the front and back fins on a fish, not the limbs on a common ancestor.\n \n \nA designer wouldn't have to do that. Even if a hoof is the best possible solution for a horse, he wouldn't need to make one out of fused toes, and he certainly wouldn't need to fill the ground with fossils indicating how that fusing process progressed over millions of years. Evolution, on the other hand, would. Does that illuminate the point satisfactorily?\n\n \n First of all, we do not find any horses in the fossil record that we do not observe around us today. The supposed sequence of the toes fusing together is nothing more than an arrangement of toes that we find on horses today. The supposed common ancestor of all horses, Eohippus, is simply a variety of the modern hydrax, a rodent like mammal. \n \n Jon Sarafati said at http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/re2/chapter8.asp\n \n \"Even informed evolutionists regard horse evolution as a bush rather than a sequence. But the so-called Eohippus is properly called Hyracotherium, and has little that could connect it with horses at all. The other animals in the 'sequence' actually show hardly any more variation between them than that within horses today. One non-horse and many varieties of the true horse kind does not a sequence make.\"\n \n Now then, suppose that you arranged all the dogs in the world by size, from the smallest to the largest. It would look a whole lot like an evolutionary sequence, wouldn't it? This is essentially what the horse sequence is.\n \n Second of all, this is yet another variation from the topic of this thread. Please, lets not hijack the topic until the original topic is settled.\n \n \nClearly Denton didn't know about creatures with eight fingers and seven toes either.\n\n \n He was discussing humans.",

They don't happen to adult creatures. They happen to the genes that produce those structures and control their development.\n \n The whole fish grows from a single, subdividing cell. Moreover, what each cell does with the DNA inside itself - what kind of cell it becomes and further divides into - is very much location-dependent within the developing embryo. This is one reason we're largely symmetrical: better data compression. \n \n For instance, our cells don't waste DNA describing both a left eye and a right eye. \n \n So although the pectoral and pelvic fins of a fish are spacially seperated in adulthood, we may observe that they are nevertheless very similar structures, budding from cells that are all copies of a single, originating cell. It is therefore reasonable to posit that the fore and aft bud cells are reading the same or very similar 'chapter' of the DNA manual, just as the left and right ones are, with location determining the remaining specific differences. They are not 'independent structures'.\n \n Eliminate the alleged independency, and the entire argument collapses.

Therefore, your argument is foiled by basic biology, unless I misunderstand you or have my facts mixed up.\n\n You do seem to have some things mixed up... especially the fact that the issue of limb development (or fin development, or whatever) is not just \"life in the cell,\" it is how cells arrange and differentiate themselves as the organism's development from zygote onward. As most people know from the media coverage of stem cell issues, each complete nucleus of the body contains all of the DNA from that first fertilized egg, which is why you can theoretically stimulate stem cells to make any tissue type. \n \n So, it's not just the genes that are in each cell - it's how those genes are expressed in development. And this is governed by a remarkable system of regulatory Hox genes, transcription factors, horomones and cell-to-cell signals that determine which genes are expressed in cells different points of development.\n \n The point is, there's a lot of genes involved in the development of the tetrapod limb or a fish fin. However, there's not a completely separate set of genes used for each instance of limb or fin in the body; a single genetic difference affecting the way a limb (or fin) develops can absolutely affect the way all limbs in an organism develop. They're made (to use what is probably an awful analogy) from the same general \"limb toolkit,\" with the same originating structure (a limb bud) and the way that the details of limb structure play out can differ according to the relative position on the body that development is taking place. Change the toolkit, and you might change all the limbs ( which is what I think Peeling was talking about when he/she referred to the \"chapter in the manual\"). Similarly, each fingernail did not evolve independently with a separate set of genes; the same set of genes are used in the development of each fingertip, although each fingertip also has its differences.\n \n Hopefully I'm not getting anything horribly wrong here, as this is well outside of my expertise (plant ecology). I normally lurk and let those more qualified take care of these questions, but I got antsy seeing your post go unanswered.\n \n Here's a good link to give an overview of development, Hox genes and so forth: The Importance of Development in Evolution.\n \n Here's a short but somewhat technical article on theories of the evolution of the tetrapod limb: Hox Genes and the Evolution of the Tetrapod Limb\n \n Here's a very good synthesis article from the International Journal of Developmental Biology: Developmental Basis for Limb Evolution (.pdf).",

   "Sorry for the delay; very busy weekend.\n \n \nIn other words, each gene in the cell is totally independent [of] each [and] every other gene.\n\n \n Yes, but as Belfrey explains, the front and rear limbs do not necessarily employ entirely different sets of genes in their creation.

I confess I have not read the bible cover to cover, but I'm sure that would have been mentioned somewhere.\n \n I'm not surprised you laughed: this is hilarious. Once upon a time the religious response to evolution was an absolute denial; it doesn't happen. Everything is as it has always been. Look how far you've fallen! With every stride science has taken, religion has had to dissemble and introduce caveats. \"Harmful mutations are entirely consistent with creationism.\" \"God permits enough genetic variation for dogs to live anywhere on the planet.\" Aren't scientists supposed to be the vacillating, inconsistent ones?",

Eyes are a major consumer of energy (Ever wonder why you close them when you are tired?), and environments in which they are not useful don't favour them. Caves, the underworld and similar.\n\n \n The latest creationist mantra is that evolution cannot produce increased complexity. The supposed rationalisation is that vestigial eyes are less complex than working eyes, therefore it is OK for them to arise as a result of mutation. The difficulty scientists have in overcoming this faulty reasoning stems from an intrinsic asymmetry: evolution doesn't tidy up after itself.\n \n Once a superfluous feature ceases to be a factor in successful breeding, it is no longer selected for atrophy or removal. Thus the natural world is littered with observable vestigial traits in living creatures, and examples like the mole rat are incontrovertible evidence of what creationists would insist is 'destructive' evolution.\n \n But 'constructive' evolution - assuming for the moment that there is a distinction to be made - naturally leaves less of a trace. We don't have a vestigial 'worse brain', or vestigial non-opposable thumbs. The features that work seem fully formed and perfect. Of course, they aren't actually perfect; they're just as good as evolution has made them so far - which is pretty damn good and much better than we could consciously design. So we usually have to rely on fossils, which are inconveniently rare and usually incomplete.\n \n However, there are a few hints out there in the living world. Here's one I learned just last week:\n \n When a butterfly emerges, its proboscis is actually in two halves, independently moveable. Shortly thereafter, the butterfly 'zips' and glues the two halves together to form a hollow tube, enabling it to drink nectar. This is another example, like the horse's fused-toe hoof, of evolution producing a 'good enough' design that no intelligence would never dream of creating from scratch. The point is not that a butterfly's proboscis would be 'better' if it was whole to begin with, it's that it makes no sense for a designer, knowing the creature's function in advance, to construct it the way it is.\n \n Creationism might try to argue that the fused proboscis is another 'harmful' mutation (1 being less than 2, after all) - except there is a fundamental contradiction: the fusing occurs after the creature is fully formed. A proboscis made of two independent halves that can be zipped together is more complex than either a single proboscis or two independent feelers. The change that made the fusing possible was an increase in complexity, not a decrease.",

There also is the fact that it is quite feasible that the 'daughter' species was isolated from the 'parent' species. \n \n Two examples. The Faero Island mouse arrived on Faero Island when man arrived there about 250 years ago. Since then, it was a small population isolated from the rest of the mouse population. During that time period, it became it's OWN species, not part of the parent species. So, you did not have the competition. In the case of monkeys.. they inhabit a tree environment. Hominids occupy the GROUND. This can be shown because of the adaptation hominids had to walk upright. So, the two species evolved away from each other because they were occupying different ecological niches. A modern example of this is two populations of insects that, although they are not YET two sepeerate species , have isolated themselves from each other because the two populations exclusively eat from different food sources.\n \n Because the two populations do not interbreed, and they exclusvie are eating two different food sources, evolution predicts that genetic variation in both daughter populations occure so that interbreding between the two will become impossible. At this point, the two populations would become two different species.. It also would be very likely that the two species become more specialised, to better take advantage of their respective food source. \n \n When it comes to the monkey example.. remember that the monkey shared a common ancestor with the hominids species.. so for the environment that they were sharing at the time, the monkey is decended from that species, so it was the 'fitter' for that particular environment.\n \n Just remember, there is no direction in evolution. It is just that populations will adapt over time to their environment, and many times , environments will change, which then puts a new set of survivial pressues on a population.",

Competition from modern-type H. sapiens is plausible, but by no means the certain cause.\n \n Second, emergent humans would hardly have competed with monkeys at all. As trebor has pointed out, monkeys are arboreal (although some, like baboons, spend some time on the ground): humans could not begin to compete with monkeys at doing the things they do.\n \n The explosive success of H. sapiens over the last few tens of thousands of years has been driven by technology. Most species respond to environmental challenge by becoming more and more adapted (physically, behaviourally etc) to their specific niche within the prevailing conditions; humans have effectively opted out of having a specialised environmental niche at all. Instead of adapting our bodies to cope with new environments, we adapt the environment to suit our bodies; instead of adapting our teeth and guts to cope with a specific food source, we adapt the food to our poorly equipped dentition and digestive system by cooking it, and as a result are able to eat almost anything that moves or grows.\n \n As a result, when we drive other species to extinction we do not do so through direct competition, like two species of Paramecium in a lab culture; we either hunt them to extinction through cooperation and technology (as seems to have happened to many prey species in the Palaeolithic), or our technology destroys their habitats.

   "DamEtel: Now, why would humans have 5 fingers and 5 toes, usually? Because the common ancestor we share with chimps - which also have 5 fingers and 5 toes - did. Evolution explains our 5 digits quite nicely, despite your uninformed assertions. \n \n ...\n \n There's a quite straightforward evolutionary explanation for why our stylopods have only one bone, and our zeugopods have two: because our ancestors did. \n \n Although not believed to be a direct ancestor of humans, Acanthostega had only one bone in its upper legs and two bones in its lower. So too did Seymouria, and Tulerpton. Having one upper and two lower limb bones seems to have been the rule for Devonian tetrapods, not the exception.\n \n\n \n \nThe Skeptic: This simply moves the question back further:\n\n \n No, what it does it show that the homologies we see in limb bones and digits in extant tetrapods are explained, NOT unexplained. Why do humans and monkeys and so many other extant tetrapods have limbs with one upper-limb bone (humerus) and two-lower limb bones (ulna and radius), ending with five digits? Because their ancestors did, as evidenced by the fossil record. \n \n And don't forget that we have independent evidence supporting the fact that the similarities in tetrapod limbs are the result of common descent: genetics.\n \n \nThe Skeptic: ... why did our common ancestor develop exactly five toes and fingers ...\n\n \n I gave a plausible explanation for why 5 digits would be the norm. You even go on to quote me giving it.\n \n \nDamEtel: There's also an Evo Devo explanation for why tetrapod forelimbs and hindlimbs share so many similarities: because the same genes are involved in their embryonic development, just as would be expected for serially repeated structures. \n\n \n \nThe Skeptic: Exactly how would this work?\n\n \n If you are interested enough to look into it yourself, try reading \"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science of Evo Devo\". I'll even point out the most relevant sections if you are interested.\n \n Note that there has been a search for the gene(s) responsible for making a limb a forelimb instead of a hindlimb, and vice versa. This indicates that essentially all of the genes studied in relation to embryonic limb development function in the formation of both the fore- and hind-limbs. Otherwise, there would be no need to search. These investigations eventually found that, in chicks, the gene Tbx5, which encodes a transcription factor, specifies forelimbs whereas the closely related transcription factor-encoding gene Tbx4 specifies hindlimbs. In fact, they've managed to produce a hybrid limb - part forelimb and part hindlimb - by exposing the anterior half of the limb disc to Tbx5 and the posterior half to Tbx4. \n \n \nDamEtel: We have genetic and experimental confirmation of the great similarity of limb development across tetrapods, exactly as expected for evolution. And of course, this broad generality of embryonic development that confirms evolution extends to many other structures than just limbs, such as eye development and so on.\n \n \n \nThe Skeptic: Please explain your quotes further and exactly how they relate to the argument.\n\n \n No, you tell me exactly which one quote you want me to explain and I'll decide whether or not I will.\n \n \nThe Skeptic: Are you saying the embryonic development sequences match each other in an evolutionary way?\n\n \n In a manner consistent with, and also strongly indicative of, evolution? Yes. \n \n And this isn't limited to just limb development. As one genetic example, there's the conserved spatial and temporal colinearity of Hox gene expression across the vertebrates. As one 'behavioral' example, there is the migration of neural crest cells throughout the embryo, which is characteristic of vertebrates.\n \n \nDamEtel: That BOTH our hands and feet have the same number is not really puzzling, since they BOTH are derived from legs of the earliest tetrapods: remember, they didn't have hands like us, and both of their limbs were much more nearly identical. \n\n \n \nThe Skeptic: Ah. Now you are missing the issue once again. Remember, 5/5 fingers/toes is simply an example, not the only similarity.\n\n \n So? You mentioned a specific example and I've addressed it.

I've given simple explanations for the \"unexplained\" homologies we see in limbs and digits in extant tetrapods. I am not obliged to chase you all over the place, wherever you decide to move the goalposts to next.\n \n \nDamEtel: So that only \"puzzle\" here is why evolution eventually found 5 digits for legs to be the best compromise - keeping in mind that evolution also produced other tetrapods with fewer than 5 digits. \n \n Here's a potential answer: \n \n **********************************\n \" ... we do have a plausible explanation for why the five-digit foot became the default tetrapod pattern: it may have helped make ankle joints that are both stable enough to bear weight and flexible enough to allow the walking gait that tetrapods eventually invented.\" (Getting a Leg Up On Land, Jennifer A. Clack, Scientific American, December 2005, p102)\n ***************************\n \n\n \n \nThe Skeptic: ... you ... presented a quote saying essentially that 5 digits is a good design. Why, then, do other tetrapods not have 5 digits (or have more than 5)?\n\n \n Your question/counter implies that all tetrapods have inhabited the very same environment and that they all have made their living in the very same manner. Otherwise, not all tetrapods would require the same degree of compromise between stability and flexibility. But this kind of absolute universalism tetrapods would be silly to propose. Different environments and ways of making a living (mobility, capturing of prey, and so on) would allow for deviations from the standard stability-flexibility compromise of 5 digits: that's only logical.",

   "DamEtel: Humans have limited time, limited knowledge, limited finances, and avoid working harder than they have to. Therefore, we reuse preexisting designs: it's quick, it's easy, it reduces buggy products, and it requires less or little thought. Obviously, with all of these benefits, reuse of working designs is a good choice for LIMITED beings, such as us humans. \n \n But to say that this applies equally to a supposed all-knowing, all-powerful, eternal supernatural being is ad hoc to say the least. We shouldn't expect God to be looking to do things quickly (He has always existed, and will always exist) or easily (He is all-powerful so nothing is any more difficult for Him to do than anything else), or be worried about avoiding bugs in His designs (He is all-knowing and all-powerful after all, so His designs shouldn't be buggy anyway) or trying to think as little as possible (He is all-knowing, so no type of thought is more difficult for Him). \n \n So this attempt to analogize the Designer God's practices to mere human designers' practices simply doesn't hold up. It is just another flawed analogy, which is essentially all that Intelligent Design Creationism ever comes up with. \n\n \n \n \nThe Skeptic: Strangely enough, that was exactly my thought when I first read about the common design argument. After giving it some thought, I came to these conclusions:\n \n 1. There are not an infinite number of possible designs that can exist in a finite universe.\n \n 2. Therefore, it is possible that God selected the best designs out of the finite number and occasionally used them more than once, not because he absolutely had to, but because it worked well, perhaps better than the alternatives.\n\n \n Uhm, so why have more than 99% of all species gone extinct? Guess God really flubbed that one! :-)\n \n Evolution doesn't need ad hoc explanations like the ones you offer. All life is similar because all life is related: as a general rule, evolution works by modifying what already exists, and then rejects the bad modifications and retains the good. That's why we see repeated examples of the same 'good design'.\n \n \nThe Skeptic: 3. Perhaps it simply pleased God to sometimes piece together different designs. Why not?\n\n \n Ad hoc, and unsupportable.\n \n \nThe Skeptic: 4. God also created many other designs, as can be seen in nature.\n\n \n Your (4) simply assumes there's a God. On what grounds? Logic dictates that we REJECT existence claims if they aren't supportable. After all, if it is the case that unsupportable existence claims are to be blindly accepted as true, then we get into all kinds of silliness. Hey The Skeptic, did you know there's a Great God called zimbanatushi sitting in your lap? Oh, he's there, you just can't see, hear, feel, smell, or in any other way detect him. Oh, and you're obligated to accept his existence as true! Oh, and don't forget about the invisible pink unicorn that sleeps in bed with you at nights. What, you don't believe in him? Why not?\n \n So again, rational thought tells us that existence claims are to be rejected if they can't be supported. Non-existence if the default position. The side claiming existence has the burden of proof. That's you. Your implicit claim of God's existence is thus rejected until you can sufficiently support it.",

   "The Skeptic: In other words, each gene in the cell is totally independent each every other gene.\n\n \n That isn't totally correct. A change in one gene's protein-coding region can affect the way that another gene is expressed (if the first gene enoded some regulatory protein, such as a transcription factor). Also, a change in the regulatory region of one gene can affect the way that it responds to a different gene's transcription factor. In fact, a single mutation in a single gene can potentially alter the expression and functioning of a slew of other genes, such as a regulatory gene involved in a genetic cascade.\n \n As the book I mentioned earlier (\"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science of Evo Devo\") points out, evolution more often than not occurs by changes in the regulatory regions (what the book refers to as \"switches\"), not in protein-coding regions. The binding affinity of the switches for their respective transcription factors controls the degree to which the gene respond. As one example, Pax-6, which is a transcription factor, is expressed in numerous regions of the embryonic body. If the sequence for Pax-6 itself changed the modified protein would exist in all regions of the embryo, probably causing deleterious effects (one reason that Pax-6 is under strong functional constraint). On the other hand, if ONE of Pax-6's target genes has a mutation in its regulatory region, then it will respond differently to Pax-6. Here, the change is limited to just one small part of the embryo, which is more likely to not be deleterious. Further, it is know that Pax-6 itself has multiple regulatory sites, affecting its expression, and that these different regulatory sites are specific to the region of the body. For example, there is a regulatory region of the Pax-6 gene is responsible for the gene getting \"turned on\" in the developing retina; another regulatory region of Pax-6 gets is responsible for its getting \"turned on\" in the pancreas; yet another causes it to get \"turned on\" in the neutral tube; and so on.",

They both have a joint about in the middle. Both your foot and hand have exactly five digits, each with finger/toe nails at the end. Both also have a layer of fat at the end of the digit.\n Lets try to make this more simple: Exactly why, apart from common design, would evolution make exactly five digits? Why not 3, or 6?\"\n \n \n \n Walking-fish:\n First of all, you didn't mention the tremendous difference in structure between the shoulder girdle & pelvic girdle, alluding to separate origins. The scapula, coracoid & acromion in the shoulder, which have become one bone in us, are quite different from the ilium, pubis & ischium in the pelvis. The shoulder girdle does not articulate with the thoracic spine, while the pelvic girdle does articulate with the spine at the lumbosacral & sacroiliac joints. Also, don't forget that the clavicle in the shoulder has no counterpart in the pelvis and that there is no counterpart to the patella (knee cap) at the elbow. Even though the forelimb & hindlimb both have extensors & flexors, there is no comparison between the muscles of the shoulder & pelvic girdles. There is definitely more homology between our arms and the wings of a bat than there is between our legs & arms.\n \n As for the pentadactyly (5 digits) of tetrapod vertebrates, there is evidence that this is a primitive condition that they all share. When there are exceptions to the rule (one toe in horses / four toes & fused fingers in birds) there is still a 5-digit template found in the embryo. It is likewise hard to explain away the separate clawed fingers in Archeopteryx and the 3-toed ancestors to the modern horse (esp when 2 of the toes no longer touch the ground in Merychippus).",

I would be a little more specific, even: it seems reasonable to me that we could possess (extremely stable) genes that govern the fundamental structure, and a second, more readily mutable 'layer' as it were that modifies the exact form of that structure. This is almost certainly a horribly crude approximation of a far, far more intricate layering - or perhaps nesting, for those with software engineering experience - of genetic information.\n \n For instance, it seems unlikely to me (though I am ready to be corrected) that we would possess genes to specifically create in every detail, for instance, a femur. More reasonable to my mind is the notion of 'bone' genes, employed over and over and over again but with varying parameters describing their exact shape. Move 'up' a layer and one can imagine a collection of meta-genes describing a finger, themselves being employed in five locations in the creation of a 'limb', which is in turn replicated four times, twice symetrically as arms and twice with different parameters to form legs.

   "First of all, I don't want to degrade Peeling's idea. It is an excellent proposal and deserves careful consideration. However, several possible problems with the idea came to mind after I grasped what he (or she) was saying. I am very much open for correction if I got my facts wrong, especially since I am making this post close to midnight.\n \n First, the leg and arm are not physically similar. They hold no parts whatsoever that are even close to being identical. By parts, I mean not only the size and number of bones but also connection points between the bones; thickness, length, and connection points of muscles; fat storage, and blood channeling systems and their relevant size and placement. If you were to pull two parts from the same places in the arm and leg, you would not find any homology whatsoever. Nonetheless, it is obvious that similarities exist. But the similarities that we find exist only in the conceptual realm, not the physical realm. In other words, we draw the conclusion of similarity not because of any actual similar parts or bones between the systems, but because the design plan seems to be the same.\n \n All of this makes it rather hard to believe that the systems have any genetic connection whatsoever - after all, if the same gene (though modified) codes for both structures, they would, it seems, not be so radically different. While we would expect some differences, we would also find more than a vague similarity. This argument becomes even more powerful when you look at the differences between a bat's wing and leg.\n \n Second, if your intention was only to say that a gene would code for only that vague similarity, you may have a problem describing exactly how this would work. How can a gene code for only a conceptual similarly that can only be observed by looking at the system as a whole?\n \n Third, it seems to me that there is no reason (other than assuming that your idea is true) to believe that the arm/leg gene that you are talking about would somehow be protected from mutations. If the gene is passed on to the offspring, it is just as likely to mutate. How can it be reasonable to believe that a vague structure gene could remain almost completely un-mutated while the actual specifics of the structure changed so drastically?

My bones are undoubtedly different lengths and shapes to yours, yet they are conceptually the same, and at least some of that difference is accounted for by genetic differences.\n \n Personally, I have no idea how genes manage to encode anything. It's an amazing feat. So to me, it seems an arbitrary and unsupportable distinction to accept that a bunch of molecules can create something like a bone, but refuse to believe they can govern something 'conceptual' like its shape and size. Making the bone is the hard part! Once you can do that, making a big one or a little one or a bent one or a straight one strikes me as a trivial leap.\n \n \nThird, it seems to me that there is no reason (other than assuming that your idea is true) to believe that the arm/leg gene that you are talking about would somehow be protected from mutations.

It's clearly beneficial for an organism to be adaptable and yet retain a high chance of mutations being biologically functional. Evolution won't merely select genes that make something useful like a limb, it will select genes that make a limb AND which are extremely robust. Of course we only see that kind of sophistication now, four billion years down the line. \n \n Plus you have it backwards; there's nothing 'vaguely structural' about the more robust genes I propose. If I say 'draw a line, then a line on the end of it, then a circle, then five lines off the circle' you have a crude representation of an arm (or leg). If I add parametric information, such as how wide and long each line should be, I can make it closer to a real arm - OR a real leg, whichever I prefer. But the fundamentals - the actual bits - are all still there. Now, if I were to evolve my instructions over time, I could smoothly mould four identical, generic limbs into distinct arms and legs. There would never be an evolutionary break, where I would have to turn off a whole batch of genes in one go to stop them making a particular structure.",

The fundes want to demote the status of evolution in the public schools, or, better yet in their eyes, have it eliminated. Basically, the fundies want to keep America stupid: that's the only way the general public will swallow the fundamentalists' \"science\".\n \n Just one or a few of the many reasons why I have great disdain for fundamentalist Christians.",

   "Ya know...\n Maybe you guys are looking at this the wrong way, what if both sides are semi-right or completely wrong?\n It doesn't make much sense that we just magically appeared as we are, nor does evolving through aeons of generations.\n Maybe it was just all a matter of chance. Besides...faith for me is too much of a committment and evolution just isn't supported by cold hard fact.\n\n \n Seriously mate, read through some of these creation/evolution arguments in depth, then go and research the arguments put forward by the evolutionists, and you will find an abundance of cold hard fact to back them all up. You can research the creationist claims if you want, but faith is seriously lacking in facts, that's why it's called \"faith\".\n And don't feel hard done by, you've gotta realise that these arguments have been had over and over again on this forum, so coming along and just saying \"evolution isn't supported\" isn't going to get you very far.",

   "Hi Skeptic,\n \n I have not posted on this board for many months, certainly nothing substantial, but I saw this thread and thought I would take a swing.\n \n \n \n\n However, what of the other homologies? For example, the similarity between your arm and leg is much closer than the similarity between your hand and a bats wing.\n\n \n By way of introduction, I will say that I have a graduate degree in Anatomy and Cell biology and I teach both human anatomy and comparative vertebrate anatomy at the university level. Not trying to brag, just pointing out that my comments here are premised on my education and experience. I should note that Denton is not an anatomist.\n First, I strongly disagree that human arms and legs are more similar than is a human arm to a bat wing.\n A simple disproof of Denton's thesis here, the configuration of the bones of the wrist is nearly identical in humans and bats, whereas the bones of the wrist and ankle in humans differ in both number and configuration.\n\n \n According to evolution, the human arms and legs evolved totally independent from each other from the front and back fins on a water dwelling ancestor. Says Denton, now an Intelligent Design advocate:\n \n \"We seem forced to propose that during the course of evolution the gradual accumulation of tiny independent and random changes in two independent structures - the pectoral and pelvic fins of a fish - hit on an identical yet apparently arbitrary ground plan for the design of the for - and hind limbs of a tetrapod.\"\n\n \n Denton exposes his ignorance here. While it is true that the exact pathway of hindlimb evolution is unclear, it is clear that vertebrates exhibit rampant serial homology and that the genes that control hind and forelimb development are likely homologs.\n Denton seems to be indicating that 'evolution' states that the events (fore and hind limb evolution) were unrelated, independant events. That is untrue.\n\n \n Yet, another explanation for the incredible similarity between the two structures exists: common design, instead of common descent. Any good engineer will use the same design more than once. \n\n Then why are not the fopre and hind limbs identical? Why are they not made from identical parts? You are trying to argue both sides of the same coin.\n\n \n For example, the nuts and bolts on a Honda will also fit on a Chevy. Is this because the Honda and Chevy evolved from a common ancestor? No, of course not. It is because the idea of a \"nut\" and \"bolt\" is a good one and was implemented by the designer. The same logic applies well to the limbs on mammals.\n\n Cars are manefactured human contrivances. Living things are not. Living things accumulate change and pass it on, cars do not.\n An inapt analogy.\n\n \n I ask the reader, which is more likely: That some homologies resulted from completely random chance, or that they all resulted from a common designer? Clearly, a designer is the better explanation.\n\n A false dilemma.\n Clearly, setting up a fact-based choice would be the logical move.",

   "My answer is this: Intelligent Design says that no non-intelligent process could have produced what we observe.\n\n \n Um, yes, and it's a rejected assertion because there is no evidence or mechanism to support it. Case closed, end of discussion, right?\n \n There are also countless contradictiory observations we yes..observe, every day. When it rains, the rain is in nice little observable packets, shaped in oh so perfect a way...do we think some little elves made them and threw them out of the clouds? Lol...how about...see physics.\n \n I submit that no intellegence could have possibly come up with the conjecture of intelligent design....based on the evidence that it's a dumb conjecture, with no evidence to support it.\n \n \nTherefore, an intelligent process must have produced it. Essentially, by ruling out the unintelligent processes, we affirm the ID theory.\n\n \n Yawn. Isn't that just dogamtic religion?\n I declare that life came from giant space gnats. Thus, by ruling out all other creators, I affirm GSG theory (Giant Space Gnats, in case you fogot).\n \n I have as much evidence as ID. Horray me. Can we teach it in school??\n \n [quote[Furthermore, there is direct evidence for scripture and the existence of God in general. That is, however, not the topic of this thread. One example are the many affirmations of Scripture, both medical, historical, and logical.[/quote]\n \n No there isn't. Really, you can't and won't give us a rational description of god, or any evidence to support such a fake notion.\n \n I just wrote, on this forum, anyone can see it and read it themselves, that Giant Space Gnats created the universe and everything in it. That's \"direct evidence\"??? You are unfortnuately..incorrect in your usage of the word.\n \n No surprise though, there is no evidence for ID, thus, it's just one of many seneless conjectures.\n \n -Mach",
