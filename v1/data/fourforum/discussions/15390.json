I believe that our actions are reactions to our surrounding environment. Our choice in reacting comes from experience and knowledge. We don't notice the process in which we choose or review which choice we will make from the available options because we aren't trying to and they happen really really fast. \n \n A person really has two componants of the brain. Conscience and sub-conscience. The SC mind sits in the background its function is to keep you alive and keep you at a constant state of ready. The C mind is for thought it makes choices that require thought and external input. \n \n As a child you stick your hand over a flame. You have no knowledge or experience to suggest this will hurt. From that point forward you know not to do that. The C mind is the lead, but it doesn't react fast enough to protect so the SC mind can take control when it needs to, the C mind can override that but not prevent the faster SC reaction. If you drop something without thinking you will try and catch it but you can change your mind before you do and pull your hand back. Pulling back is a C choice reaching for it wasn't.\n \n The example with the friend was not random thought, but experience and knowledge pulling what it knows and saying these are your possibilities. Tests measuring brain activity before awareness for me is the SC mind working faster but doesn't have awareness that belongs to the slower C mind. \n \n We have free choice within the boundaries of our environment, knowledge and capabilities, but our free choice is also limited to being reactionary.

The consequence may justify the choice, but it doesn't force the choice to be made.\n\n \n If free will is determined by the result of the choice then what is the conclusion when someone changes their mind? Did they have it and now don't or did they not and now do?\n \n This thinking would imply that Christians have no free will because they choose to accept Gods conditions while athiests do have free will for not doing so. \n \n This also places freewill right on the edge of being a moral choice. Choosing to do the right thing would be encouraged so those who do have no freewill and vice versa.\n \n For me this is why the end result is not what determines but in the case of Religion it is the punishment or reward that influences the decision and the belief that God directs our behavior through various means",

   "But why not? \n \n Let's say that I do have freewill. I live my life making free choices free from influence of an observer outside of my continuum. You're basically saying that just because someone has the ability to move in time to any point within my timeline and simply view it, even if they have absolutely no ability to interfere, that my life was predetermined and the entity that determined the unfolding of my timeline cannot be me. \n \n Clear a couple of things up for me. In this scenario, if I wasn't determining my own path, then what was? Why can't something else, outside of my continuum, know what my actions are? \n \n I think you are not understanding what atemporality is in this case. If something knows what all of my actions are, you can't say that he knows them before they take place because there is no before, no after, no during in his continuum. He is outside of my timeline. He is atemporal to my continuum. \n \n My example of a movie was to demonstrate this. Just because someone can watch the movie having already seen it and knows what the ending is going to be, does not necessitate that the movie was predetermined within the timeline and at the time in which it was created.\n\n Look at it from the perspective of options.

It is equivalent to having no choice but to pick the option that was predetermined and foreknown. There was really no other choice at all to begin with\n\n From that perspective of options, I think you are right. Here are some other ways of looking at that scenario though:\n \n 1. If free will is the ability to choose what you want, and you want A, then you will choose A. If God foresaw this choice, then he foresaw you're wanting it first and thus choosing it based on what you wanted. God foreseeing the future not only means he foresees your choices but also the means by which you reach those choices. If your choices are determined on your desires, then that is the epitomy of free will and thus we have a compatible view. Just because God foresaw your desire and action doesn't make that desire and action any less yours.\n \n 2. If free will is the ability to choose such that you could have chosen otherwise, then we might have a future which is not exactly foreseeable. Some people might understand God's omniscience of the future to mean that he knows all possible scenarios that would come into play based off of what you might choose. They would say that that doesn't sacrifice God's omniscience, because having complete knowledge of all counterfactuals doesn't mean God will be 'surprised' (for lack of a better term) by any of your choices. In this case we have a compatible view, you're choices are based on limited options, but you still would have the freedom to choose among the options such that you could have chosen otherwise.\n \n 3. If free will is the ability to choose only what God makes you choose, then God forces you to choose and that is free will!\n \n Sidenote: that last one was a joke",

Just because our feeble minds cannot conceive of this does not detract from the logical argument.\n \n And just to reiterate, I still do not believe that this being exists.\n\n I personally disagree with the \"feeble minds\" reasoning. If God existed, omniscient/omnipotent or not, he would exist in a manner that man could comprehend. Otherwise his existence would be pointless to mankind, and all the other fringe benefits of his existence (creation, guidance, eternal life, etc) would be inconcievable to begin with. In other words, if God's omnipotence included the ability to do the illogical, then nobody would know he exists, including the proponents of religion as we know today. And therefore any reference to God's existence, his definition and description, would be totally conjecture based on absolutely nothing. Therefore even if God was omnipotent in a manner that made him illogical, nobody could possibly comprehend such a being, much less be in a position to claim that he even exists (since all humans are endowed equally with \"feeble minds\"). It would matter if such a God existed in reality, since he could very well exist and not exist in reality simultaneously anyway. \n \n I just busted a mental nut lol",

Let's try another one: \"My house is located 5 miles directly north of the north pole.\" This statement is meaningless because the north pole is at the tip of the longitude lines, it is as far north as you can possibly be and no more. \n Do you notice how I demonstrated and proved why those statements were meaningless? I'm asking you to do the same thing. I agree with you that people say such meaningless statements more often than they should, but you can't just say \"that's meaningless\" and expect to get away with it. You have to give a reason and show why it's meaningless, it has to be demonstrated. If a statement truly is meaningless, it shouldn't be that hard to show, right?\n \n Again, prove it.\n \n I have a sneaking suspicion you weren't really paying attention to the post when you read it. I said that God was omnipotent, but that doesn't mean there are things God can't do. I said God can't sin, but I also said that this doesn't mean in any way that he is not omnipotent. I agree with you that God is omnipotent, but the question is not \"is God omnipotent?\" the question is \"what does omnipotence mean?\" I think a great answer is in those posts.\n \n Gansao, you haven't shown anything. All your doing is saying \"that's ludicrous.\" You can't just say something without backing it up, saying \"it's ludicrous\" doesn't automatically make it ludicrous. If it really is ludicrous, then demonstrate that it is, the burden of proof is on you.\n\n \n You cant ' catagorise' infinite or any refence to it .\n You cannot quantify it or attribute any limitations to it.\n If you think you can please try.\n Language is not capable..but language is capable of stating that it is not capable of doing this..look I just have.\n \n I have a sneaking feeling that you have paid attention to my posts.\n I have stated that we cannot comprehend an infinite value so' what does omnipotence mean' does not mean anything..and dont make a lame response lke prove itemoticon_xdonno\n I never saw a ' great answer' in any of your posts\n Thats why your assertion I am defeating my postition by using language to say that language cannot be used to describe or quantify an omnipotent being is ludicrous.",

So these are two things that don't change, because it's impossible for God to lie. He did this so that we, who have taken refuge in him, can be encouraged to grasp the hope that is lying in front of us. \n \n This was so that, by two unchangeable things [His promise and His oath] in which it is impossible for God ever to prove false or deceive us, we who have fled [to Him] for refuge might have mighty indwelling strength and strong encouragement to grasp and hold fast the hope appointed for us and set before [us].\n \n So when God wanted to prove for certain that his promise to his people could not be broken, he made a vow. 18God cannot tell lies! And so his promises and vows are two things that can never be changed. \n \n God wouldn't change his plan. He wanted to make this perfectly clear to those who would receive his promise, so he took an oath. 18God did this so that we would be encouraged. God cannot lie when he takes an oath or makes a promise. These two things can never be changed. Those of us who have taken refuge in him hold on to the confidence we have been given. \n \n To those who were to receive what he promised, God wanted to make it very clear that he would never change his purpose; so he added his vow to the promise.18 There are these two things, then, that cannot change and about which God cannot lie. So we who have found safety with him are greatly encouraged to hold firmly to the hope placed before us.\n\n \n It's not saying that God promised and he simply chose not to break it (in this interpretation that you are taking, the entire section of it being impossible for him to lie is redundant and meaningless, as it already said that God made the oath); it's saying that God's oaths are guaranteed because he cannot lie... it is impossible for him to break the oath. That he chose to make the oath is again irrelevant. Once he made it, it was impossible for him to break it.

What is limiting about 'all powerful' (almighty), or 'eternal,' or 'all knowing?' They are terms that are all encompassing (yet still limit God, in the sense that God must fit the definitions.) Hand-waving away any evidence that goes against your view as a limitation of language can't work in this argument, though, since you were the one who wanted to see where the bible (which is composed of language) placed limitations on God.

   "You cant ' catagorise' infinite or any refence to it .\n If you think you can please try. I have stated that we cannot comprehend an infinite value so. \n\n If you are saying that we cannot know or understand what infinity really means I would vehemently disagree. The word 'infinite' is a composed of a prefix which carries with it a negative attribute; to say infinite is equivalent to saying non-finite or \"something is infinite\" is the same as saying \"something is not finite.\" But don't we have an understanding of what finite is? I'm sure you would agree that we do, so in that sense, we can at least know something about the infinite by negation; this gives us some degree of understanding. We know that infinite is NOT what we are or what we know finite to be. This is not an exhaustive understanding (many times it is hard to get complete understanding) but it is the reference of categorization I think you might have been looking for.\n \n\n Language is not capable..but language is capable of stating that it is not capable of doing this..look I just have. \n\n I really think language is capable of understanding something about the infinite, (and even about the omnipotent) and I have already given my reasons.\n \n\n I have a sneaking feeling that you have paid attention to my posts.\n\n I'm guessing this is a typo.\n \n\n 'what does omnipotence mean' does not mean anything..and dont make a lame response lke prove itemoticon_xdonno\n\n I don't think it is lame to ask someone to back up their claims with proof or evidence, I mean, this is a debate forum after all. In the end even your statements that language cannot be applied to God are describing an attribute of God. If you really think language is capable of saying \"language is incapable of communicating God's attributes\" then that statement itself tells us something about God, namely that 'he is beyond our communication of language.' You cannot deny this and affirm that 'language is capable of saying it is incapable of this' at the same time.",

   "The Bible tells us the aspects of God that God wants us to know.\n It does not attempt to quantify Gods power or make arbitary limits on it.\n Unless you believe gods actual and potential power is limited by the covenants he makes...which is illogical.\n\n Don't throw that term around too loosely, I mean the term 'illogical'. If you really think it is illogical, you have to show where the contradiction is, because I can't see how it is contradictory to say that God cannot break his promises because he will not break his promises. I think that is the problem, you seem to think that \"cannot\" implies a want to but metaphysical inability to. However, \"cannot\" could mean, a wanting not to and therefore the metaphysical possibility is ruled out.\n \n\n A fathers still has the potential to harm his children even if he promises not to. He has the potential to take away gifts to his children even though he has decided not to.\n\n Lets say God promised not to do X but still had the potential to do X. If God did X, he would be a liar, thus meaning that God cannot always keep his promises. If God didn't do X then that means God always keeps his promises and therefore cannot do X. Either way you look at it, God can't do something, but it is a limit that he himself sets and/or is the very identity of who he is (morally perfect) and not a weakness.\n \n\n An agreement is not a weakness or a disabilty.\n\n You don't need to convince me of that, I agree that God's omnipotence is not infringed upon just because he agrees to something.",
