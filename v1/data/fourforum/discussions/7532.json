But today i learn our Constitution makes Congress the most powerful branch of government. Is this a good thing? or a bad? i thought that the framers made the three branch of government coequal, to keep the three branch in check with each other",

If it goes against the Constitution then it IS the responsibility of the courts to strike it down. But if it's simply unjust in your eyes, but isn't in the majority of the citizens' or the legislatures' eyes, you're out of luck. Start spreading the word, protesting, and writing petitions. Why have laws if at any time a judge can simply rule that a law is \"unjust\"? What if one judge (or 5/9 of the justices on the Supreme Court) decided that putting people in prison for murder was unjust. There's nothing we can do about it until they die. Not their job to do, it's the legislatures' job. You wanna change that? Well I suspect you know already. 2/3 of the Senate and house, and 3/4 of the states.",
