   "In a previous posting I attempted to clarify what science is, by better defining the scientific method, in an effort to restructure this debate in a constructive manner. I found out that the concept \"science\" is not as cut and dry as the lay person might expect. Since then I have read a few books; one was particularly educational: Defending Science - Within Reason. \n \n In this book, Susana Haack makes the point that there is no \"scientific method\" per se. Her point, that a methodical, empirical, investigative methodology is not unique to science, is well made (for a good summary, read this review). Basically she points out that good research and investigation is good research and investigation whether it was done by a historian (or any profession) or scientist. \n \n If Ms. Haack is correct, science is not distinguished from other studies simply by its methodology. But what distinguishes it? Can we even call one field \"science\" and another non-scientific? In my assessment, yes. \n \n I would agree that it is not only how a person studies which makes them a scientist. I would then assert it is what a person studies. Obviously, the person who studies the life of King Henry the VIII is not a scientist. Not because the historian is not honest, thorough, and methodical in his research. Rather it is because he does not have the luxury of observing, re-observing, poking at, and otherwise experimenting with his subject.\n \n I would thus submit that the primary difference between science and the other fields of study is the subject examined. A scientific subject is one which is readily available, in an active state, for observation and experimentation.",

   "I would thus submit that the primary difference between science and the other fields of study is the subject examined. A scientific subject is one which is readily available, in an active state, for observation and experimentation.\n Very well there are in fact a number of submethods used in science. But all include collection of data, analysis of data, formulation of hypotheses concerning the data (including relationships within it), projection of consequences of the hypotheses and empirical testing of the hypotheses, followed by assessment of whether the extended observations confirm or negate the hypothesis and then iterating the process as necessary to the satisfaction of the researcher/scientific community. The number of specific ways that this basic skeleton can be employed are indeed numerous. Darwin arrived at his theory for example by combining observations from a great number of sources and eventually settled on the hypothesis that heritable variation combined with natural selection (as he defined it) to yield change and diversification over time. Others since then have both extended his insights and probed the principal hypotheses and the extensions without mercy.\n \n All that said and done TOE in its basics as postulated by Darwin has proven remarkably robust and useful to understand great swaths of biology.\n \n I wonder where you are going with this thread, but perhaps that will put my marker down somewher on the issue surface.",

   "You may have seen the recent \"Evolution Schmevolution\" segments on the Daily Show. One of these segments was a panel of experts: one each from three theories on biological origins - Evolution, Intelligent Design, and Metaphysical Creationism. The evolutionist panel member, Dr. Edward J Larson, made these assertions:\n \n \"Evolution is the core concept in the biological sciences\"\n \"[Evolution is] where all the breakthroughs in medicine and biotechnology have come from over the past hundred years.\"\n \n This started me thinking...what scientific breakthroughs were depedent on the concept of macro evolution? I could not come up with anything...but I am not up-to-date on the latest breakthroughs. Could anyone help me here?\n \n Ah thats your earlier thread (2 years ago!) did not read it quickly enough.\n \n OK the number of SCIENTIFIC breakthrouhs are almost numberless. Via the concept of evolution (including so called macro-evolution) biologists have been able to understand in greater and greater detail the interrelationships of the various species (a whole bunch of em) on the planet earth. We have been able to probe our own orignins and migrations. We have been able to understand the deep roots of our critical agricultural crops in the past and thusly improve them more systematically. Likewise with livestock. We have a better grasp of our parasites and pathogens and to some extent our own biology. We use these ideas to control and constrain our pathogens and parasites in medicine. We use them to set up integrated pest control systems for our crops. We use them in breeding those self-same crops for purposes of being resistant to evolving pathogens (see multi-line crops). We use the concepts to breed and retain endangered species (see cheetahs). And on and on and on and on. Is that a good start?",

   "**\n \"Science\" and its cognates are derived from the latin, to know, and as a noun, science in its broadest sense simply means \"knowledge\". It is seldom used in this sense, however, more frequently referring to some specific body of knowledge or field of intellectual enquiry. Since \"The Enlightenment\", 'science' has usually referred to research and methodology grounded in rigourous discipline, an emphasis upon objectivity, a dependence upon fact, and an insistence that any inference be grounded in fact. Fact, during the same period, has come to mean that which is empirically observable, and measurable. The coupling of empiricism with materialism led inevitably to a distinction between 'natural science', knowledge derived from the observation of physical phenomena, and 'social science', the study of psychical phenomena, that is, phenomena not prceptibly driven by the 4 'forces', originally phenomena that appeared to be peculiarly human, but which are become are more and more discernible across the wide spectrum of life in all its forms.\n \n Since 'bits of stuff in motion' are infinitely easier to classify and, above all, measure, 'natural science' progressed much faster than 'social science' in its utility to humanity, at least in terms of material well-being. An imbalance which has, unfortunately, brought us to the brink of destroying ourselves and the rest of the world with us.\n \n The disparity (in the ease with which passive 'stuff' reacts to something we call 'the forces', and the regularity and ease of measurement and classification that this passivity enables, contrasted to the dynamism of the psychical world, which makes its phenomena difficult to measure, classify, and above all, predict), has contributed to the common feeling today that the word 'science' and 'scientist' should only be properly used wrt the study of bits of stuff in motion, and the people who observe, measure, and categorize these movements and interactions. Thus 'natural science' has become subcategorized into physics, chemisty, and so on. \n Those engaged in such sciences tend to the opinion that those who study the psycho-social phenomena of human beings and other life forms are not 'scientists' at all, but something other-- and lesser. No matter how useful and beneficial to humanity the results of their labours may prove. Worse, these self-titled 'scientists' also try to reduce the social sciences, the study of psychical phenomena, to natural sciences, the study of the interactions of moving bits of stuff. For example, biology is reduced to biochemistry, and sociology, psychology, etc., to evolutionary psychology, aka, genetic determinism.\n \n Predictably, with this zeitgeist, the world marches lock-step into the mouth of Hell.",

I have a history as being an expert witness with regard to data quality. Neither side would have the slightest clue how I might evaluate their case. If Cornwell were to put her case before a jury after due editing of admissible evidence by a decent judge, the average jury would bring back a guilty verdict. I know a couple of attorneys who do cold cases some many years old in which the forensic evidence is less than fresh and from time to time they are able to find the criminal and sometimes exonerate the convicted defendant. The fact that the body is no longer laying on the floor or that the blood samples are outdated does not seem to be an impossible barrier to overcome with creativity and good tools. Of course if all the evidence happens to have been put on a spacecraft and shot into the sun I suppose it would be much more difficult - ie not available for study! Or if the crime occurred on a planet several million light years away I suppose one would have to consider it \"inactive\".

After all look at how the papers are organized. There are the strictly technical sections, a conclusion section where one is obligated to make supported logical inferences, and a discussion section (often combined with the conclusions) in which researchers sometimes explore the more speculative aspects of their work. After science is not afraid of creating new hypotheses to be tested and possibly shot down by fellow scientists - its the life blood of the field. Absent speculation everything would grind to a halt.

Such tools do not \"evolve\" omn their own, without human intention or purpose.\n \n If, OTH, you wish to speak speak of organismic internal temperature regulation systems, then do no speak of thermostats, because an organism is not a 'thermostat', whether it is cold-blooded, warm-blooded, or anywhere in between.\n \n Here, for your edification, (and because you never consult a dictionary before dictating to the world the meaning you have chosen to bestow upon a word), \n is the definition of \"thermostat\".\n \n \"ther\u00b7mo\u00b7stat (th\u00fbr'm&#601;-st&#259;t') \n n.\n A device, as in a home heating system, a refrigerator, or an air conditioner, that automatically responds to temperature changes and activates switches controlling the equipment.\"\n \n This plain definition is elaborated upon at answers.com, but this one says it all, FAPP.\n \n Now, you are no doubt going to try to fog things up a bit by pretending that our planet, with it's 'heat distribution' mechanisms, is some kind of,\n 'thermostat'.

The earth's temperature, overall, is beyond any 'self-control' of any kind, (or indeed, any external contol beyond what humans may or may not accomplish re global warming).
