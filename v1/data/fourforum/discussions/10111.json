It's endemic to most sects (not all) to trash Catholicism as heretical, paganistic and apostate.\n \n Is it a shame that Catholics are doing the same again?\n \n AA. The WofF's would most likely be that church, Not the Catholics. WofFers are rapidly growing where as the Catholics are shrinking. Stongholds of them in South America and Africa and even Asia are changing.\n Razz Matazz emotionalism is far more digestable than the boooooring droooning of the RCC.\n \n Personally, both groups should have NOT stopped fighting until only one remained. IMO, they lacked sufficient faith in thier causes to put their lives on the line, excising the canker from the body of Christ.\n \n Yes, Zardoz is advocating M.A.D. and Sectarian violance.\n I'd consider it the 'Eastern Front' of the 'war on terror'. emoticon_xbouncer",

Oh who to believe. yawn\n\n \n Well, you believe who ever has the gun to your head at the time.\n \n Ironically, I finally got around to watching 'Munich' a few nights back.\n Had a dream about it too.\n \n A group of Islamic terrorists were going to kill me (and some others). As they were dragging my into another room to shoot me (I don't know why they didn't shoot the others 1st). Anyway, while I'm holding onto the doorway with finger and toe tips, I found that not only did I have a deeper respect for Islam but was reciting the little Arabic I knew (which is more than I thought I knew) and discussing Islam (wish I knew as mush as I did about Christianity)with the captors.\n Boy, instant conversion.\n \n All I had to do was convince them of that.\n \n Of course, when they started to listen, I did try to get them to stop killing people and take up passive resistance and going door to door like the J.W's and Mormons. And then moving into a place and breed like rabbits.\n \n Seems to have worked for all the other groups before them...more successfully than the blowing yourself up thing.\n \n I wasn't scared during the dream. Nor did I really care about the fate of the other hostages (whom I didn't know).\n \n So, yeah, color me Patty Hearst. A living, breathing Patty Hearst.",

With many followers rabidly defending their 'men of god'.\n \n As for the man-made rules. \n So long as they follow established traditions fomr those times and don't contradict scripture or detract from it there is little problem.
