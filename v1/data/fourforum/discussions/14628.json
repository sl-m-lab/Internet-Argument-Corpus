   "Bill Clinton said the following about the Tea Party:\n \nThere are a lot of real people in this Tea Party movement that are saying something everyone should hear, which is \"seems like everyone but average Americans are doing all right here. The people that caused the financial crisis are all back in great shape,\" (and its true that the banks have 1.8 trillion dollars in uncommitted cash reserves.) \"The government is in pretty good shape - the people who work for the government have good jobs, health care and can pay their mortgages and can send their kids to college. What about us?\"\n The problem is that if you look at the financial energy behind the Tea Party movement, its not about restricting abuse of big public and private power, its about destroying the role of government in our life so that private centers of power will be untrammeled, and I don't think that's good for average Americans.\n\n \n I tend to agree with this statement but think there is more to it. Personally I am unsure about the tea party. They have identified some of the problems but the solutions, I feel, have been hijacked by the same old \"Republican speak\". This is exactly what Clinton was getting at too. The tea-party folks are rightfully angry and politicians SHOULD take note and fix the problem yet we see Sarah Palin out there representing the tea party and people like Ron Paul who basically started the thing still considered an outsider. Now when we look at what \"solutions\" the tea-party folks have it basically boils down to \"stop everything that doesn't benefit me\" while at the same time lowering taxes. Is this why we end up with people all for reducing spending but when it is THEIR military base that is closing than this is crazy and another should be chosen. \n \n If the tea-party folks are serious than they need to realize that the sacrifice has to come from them as well. Until I see this I'll probably still be skeptical. \n \n Your thoughts?",

Not surprising considering the GOP stands for what the Democrats stand for.

How on earth is that a bad thing? \n \n Really though, the big problem I see is what I posted. The tea party supposedly has certain ideals but how long before they get hijacked.

   "Though I sympathize with some of the concerns of the Tea Party - in terms of fiscal irresponsibility, in terms of the Middle Class being hurt, etc - these people seem to be far more motivated by their own emotional reaction to these problems than by rational analysis. That is why they are so easily led by those with a charismatic presentation style - such as Sarah Palin - and, indirectly, by those that fund the movement to support their own private agendas. \n \n Throughout history, genuine but simple people have been manipulated by those in power to get their way. It seems that that is what is happening with the Tea Party. Among others, the Koch brothers (the richest billionaires in the US after Bill Gates and Warren Buffet) are giving significant funding for the Tea Party to fulfill their very right wing political agenda - The billionaire Koch brothers' war against Obama : The New Yorker . \n \nThe Kochs are longtime libertarians who believe in drastically lower personal and corporate taxes, minimal social services for the needy, and much less oversight of industry-especially environmental regulation. \n \n ...\n \n The anti-government fervor infusing the 2010 elections represents a political triumph for the Kochs. By giving money to 'educate,' fund, and organize Tea Party protesters, they have helped turn their private agenda into a mass movement. Bruce Bartlett, a conservative economist and a historian, who once worked at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based think tank that the Kochs fund, said, 'The problem with the whole libertarian movement is that it's been all chiefs and no Indians. There haven't been any actual people, like voters, who give a XXXX about it. So the problem for the Kochs has been trying to create a movement.' With the emergence of the Tea Party, he said, 'everyone suddenly sees that for the first time there are Indians out there-people who can provide real ideological power.\" The Kochs, he said, are 'trying to shape and control and channel the populist uprising into their own policies.'\n \n A Republican campaign consultant who has done research on behalf of Charles and David Koch said of the Tea Party, 'The Koch brothers gave the money that founded it. It's like they put the seeds in the ground. Then the rainstorm comes, and the frogs come out of the mud-and they're our candidates!' \n\n \n The policies of the Tea Party will not help the Middle Class. They will just help the elite get even wealthier. It is because of the ease by which the members of the Tea Party are being misled and because of the very unsupported and unjust attacks that their candidates throw at both Democrats and moderate Republicans that I consider them a problem for the US, not a benefit.",

Preferably people who are actually mildly retarded. They can understand the dumb people. Palin uses little words and has simple solutions to problems that her supporters do not even understand. Since they do not understand them, they do not realize that her solutions are dumb and will not work.\n \n \n Simply put, this great experiment we call America has gone off track and has failed. All the safeguards put in place against an over powerful federal government have failed. \n \n 635 congressmen are supposed to be representing 300 million americans. Only a complete and utter fool could believe that is anywhere close to possible. We basically have no representation at the federal level. The thing is, that is how our system was essentially designed, but there was very little that was supposed to be done at the federal level that impacted the day to day lives of Americans. If you look at the powers of congress in the constitution, pretty much the only one that was likely to impact people on a daily basis was their power to establish post offices and postal roads. \n \n BUT, years of decisions by authoritarian judges have essentially put us in a position where, as my local state representative put it earlier in the year before resigning, \"Nancy Pelosi has more say in the day to day lives of Kansans than the entire Kansas legislature does\".\n \n The federal government has seized so much power that we are pretty much without representation in the things that impact our daily lives the most. Even things that we PRETEND are still under the control of the states are not. The carrot and stick that come with federal education and road tax money pretty much give the federal government complete control in those areas.

   "I dont think that \"Americans\" have unrealistic expectations. I think that a lot of americans have DIFFERENT expectations and congress is essentially trying to cater to all of them. \n\n I think it is a combination of the two. Yes, not all Americans demand low taxes AND low deficits AND large social programs, etc. There are some, and if you call yourself libertarian then you might count yourself among those, that want to severely reduce spending (including major social programs such as Social Security and Medicare), are willing to live with the social consequences, and through such spending cuts achieve balanced budgets and lower taxes. Others want to achieve balanced budgets by maintaining the social programs but raising taxes. Others want to cut military spending instead. These are people who realize that some sacrifices have to be made to achieve their goals (though I would argue that, most of the time, the sacrifices are not their own but somebody elses).\n \n However, most of the rhethoric I have heard about reducing government are from people who would not be able to afford the consequences of Social Security and Medicare being gutted - given how little the great majority of Baby Boomers have saved for retirement and that most members of the tea party and other such organizations are not upper Middle Class and need to depend on these systems. You get absurd statements such as the far right woman during the health care debates who was insistent that the government keep their hands off of her Medicare. I rarely see people present rational arguements that truly work through the consequences of their goals being actually realized. For example, how do you keep deficits from skyrocketing if you significantly cut taxes without cutting spending? Also, how do you expect to signficantly cut spending if you barely touch Social Security, Medicare or Military spending? If you touch SS or Medicare, what do you expect will happen to poor seniors - they will just die miserable deaths with minimal medical care in some poor house? I would be surprised if you thought that MOST Americans have thought through all of the consequences.\n \n \nThat is the problem with the federal power grab we have seen. The federal government is using one set of rules to govern farmers in Kansas, factory workers in Michigan, and flakes in california (could not resist :) ). That is fine if the rules they are making are broad enough and abstract enough. None of the above listed people probably care how many letters of reprisal congress grants or how many titles of nobility they fail to convey. When you get a federal government passing sweeping laws that directly impact the day to day activities of your average americans, there is no possible way they can actually come up with good and comprehensive laws that meet the needs of all the people. The peoples needs are just too different.\n\n I am curious. What specific powers of the federal government do you find so offensive? Why do you think it would be so much better if those same powers were handed over to the states instead?",

Yes, in general, I agree that a smaller representative group (fewer people per representative) leads to a government that is more responsive to people's desires since different groups (ex. different states) can respond to the different needs of their people. \n \n However, there are at least three situations that I can think of in which such a subdivision of power is not optimal. \n \n First, there are necessary organizations that would simply be very inefficient if they were run at the state (or local) level. The best example of this is the military. Imagine how ineffective it would be if it were run at a state level. The age of local militias is long over. Another example might be the State Department. How efficient would it be, for example, if half the states decided to introduce sanctions against a country and the other half would not.\n \n Secondly, some states are far poorer than other states (ex. Mississippi vs Maryland). In many instances, the federal government gets involved in programs so that the poorer states get subsidized by the richer states. I, for one, think that there is some merit in that distribution - both out of a sense of compassion and also out of a sense that it helps the entire country if there is a larger pool of educated workers (for example) through governement education subsidies. I would think that Social Security and Medicare would fall under this concern. How would a state like Mississippi be able to afford SS and Medicare for its seniors, in you view, without the redistribution associated with them being Federal programs?\n \n Lastly, there are legal differences between states that sometimes cause the government to be involved. Take medical marihuana in California. Yes, theoretically, it is meant to be only used in California but we both know how easy it is to transport marihuana across state lines. When all other states make it illegal, there is some vested interest in the Federal government to get involved in limiting its potential illegal inter-state distribution. It can either set up large road blocks between states to make sure that the marihuana doesn't pass state lines, or, far more cheaply and effectively, it can help determine how it is distributed within the state.\n \n There might be other concerns that do not come to mind at the moment. All in all, as long as there is no compelling reason for a power to be held by the federal government (such as the reasons I just mentioned), then I would agree that it would be better held by a lower level group - ex. state or local.",

Yes, in general, I agree that a smaller representative group (fewer people per representative) leads to a government that is more responsive to people's desires since different groups (ex. different states) can respond to the different needs of their people. \n \n However, there are at least three situations that I can think of in which such a subdivision of power is not optimal. \n \n First, there are necessary organizations that would simply be very inefficient if they were run at the state (or local) level. The best example of this is the military. Imagine how ineffective it would be if it were run at a state level. The age of local militias is long over. Another example might be the State Department. How efficient would it be, for example, if half the states decided to introduce sanctions against a country and the other half would not.\n\n \n The military is specifically listed as a power of congress in the constitution. \n \n The state department is part of the executive branch under the presidents power to make treaties (diplomacy is part of the treaty making process). \n \n I am telling you, the guys who wrote this stuff had good heads on them. \n \n \nSecondly, some states are far poorer than other states (ex. Mississippi vs Maryland). In many instances, the federal government gets involved in programs so that the poorer states get subsidized by the richer states. I, for one, think that there is some merit in that distribution - both out of a sense of compassion and also out of a sense that it helps the entire country if there is a larger pool of educated workers (for example) through governement education subsidies. I would think that Social Security and Medicare would fall under this concern. How would a state like Mississippi be able to afford SS and Medicare for its seniors, in you view, without the redistribution associated with them being Federal programs?\n\n \n Maybe you could explain to me WHY some states are poorer than others, then we can look at why the government should be intervening to level that playing field. For the most part the states have a pretty level playing field. Those that have not prospered have largely not prospered because they have made poor decisions. \n \n There are states that choose not to be business friendly because the people that live there perceive some kind of benefit to them in that decision. My state (kansas) is not real friendly when it comes to most heavy industry because we do not want a bunch of heavy industry here. We prefer to keep the smoke stacks and pollution somewhere else. That is a decision we made. Why should people in Illinois, who did chose to put up with the smoke stacks and pollution in return for more money, have to subsidize our decision in Kansas?? \n \n \nLastly, there are legal differences between states that sometimes cause the government to be involved. Take medical marihuana in California. Yes, theoretically, it is meant to be only used in California but we both know how easy it is to transport marihuana across state lines. When all other states make it illegal, there is some vested interest in the Federal government to get involved in limiting its potential illegal inter-state distribution. It can either set up large road blocks between states to make sure that the marihuana doesn't pass state lines, or, far more cheaply and effectively, it can help determine how it is distributed within the state.\n\n \n OR, it could do it the legal and constitutional way, which would be to stay out of it. If the government of California want to legalize marijuana, that has nothing at all to do with the federal government. If the state of nevada chooses to keep it illegal, and they catch somebody in possession of it who bought it in California, they can still arrest them for possession of marijuana. \n \n There are a LOT of things that are legal in some states and not in others. By your logic the states should have NO authority, because that way all the states will essentially have the same laws with daddy fed keeping them all in line. \n \n That is pretty much the EXACT opposite of how our country was supposed to work. It is not designed to work that way and when we try to make it work that way not surprisingly it fails. \n \n That really was the point. If people in CA want to smoke pot, they can. If people in NJ dont want it around, they can outlaw it. People get the opportunity to live the way they want, not the way that people 1000 miles away think they should. \n \n There might be other concerns that do not come to mind at the moment. All in all, as long as there is no compelling reason for a power to be held by the federal government (such as the reasons I just mentioned), then I would agree that it would be better held by a lower level group - ex. state or local.[/QUOTE]",

California on the other hand ruined themselves so you have to ask yourself how to handle that if you work on a federal system. Not an easy answer in my opinion.\n \n You should go by the way, it is a beautiful state.\n\n \n There is no such thing as \"naturally poor\". Most of what we consider \"wealth\" is an artificial construct which essentially exists outside the realm of nature (unless you are mining or farming). Just doing some quick research I did find this:\n \n \nAlabama is part of the largest industrial growth corridor in the nation. Most of this growth is due to Alabama's rapidly expanding automotive manufacturing industry. Headquartered in the state are Honda Manufacturing of Alabama, Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, Mercedes-Benz U.S. International, and Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama. Since 1993, the automobile industry has generated more than 67,800 new jobs in the state. Alabama currently ranks 4th in the nation in automobile output.[61]\n\n \n An interesting tidbit from the Franklin county times:\n \n The Franklin County Times Auto industry keeps helping Alabama?s economy\n \n \nIt wasn't that long ago when Alabama didn't even have an auto industry. In 1994, Alabama did not manufacture one car or truck, not one. Today, Alabama has become second in the nation in the number of autos it makes, a remarkable pattern of growth that is unmatched in our state history, and is the model for every other state in the country.\n \n Back in 1994, then Gov. Jim Folsom landed Alabama's first auto manufacturer, Mercedes-Benz, making a deal to build a groundbreaking plant in Vance. Folsom was criticized by many at the time about state government taking such an active role in industrial recruiting.\n\n \n \nWhat Folsom did in landing the Mercedes plant was organize our state to enter the modern world economy, and forever changed Alabama. He showed that we could prepare outstanding industrial sites. He set up tax structures that supported manufacturing.\n \n Most importantly, he highlighted to the world the skill and effectiveness of the Alabama worker. Alabama has the nation's top rated jobs training program, AIDT, and is one of the biggest draws for new industries to come to Alabama.\n \n The state's efforts to build an infrastructure of workforce development to complement our prime industrial locations has moved Alabama from last to second in the auto industry within a span of just fifteen years.\n\n \n Looking at the industrial growth numbers, I dont think that Alabama is going to have any problem maintaining a SS program, especially if they have their portion of bonds from the current SS trust fund to kick start it and get it up and running. \n \n The interesting thing is that as far as I can tell, prior to 1993/1994, Alabama was extremely business unfriendly. Instead of working to encourage businesses to set up manufacturing facilities there, their policy seemed to be to tax anybody dumb enough to do it to death. \n \n That obviously was not working for them, so they changed. \n \n I am sorry, but sometimes a little tough love is in order. Alabama had foolish, anti growth policies. A lot of states have foolish, anti growth policies. As long as uncle moneybags will take the money from states that DONT have foolish, anti growth policies and transfer it to those that do, there is no reason to change the foolish, anti growth policies.\n \n That is one of the problems with giving the people control of their destiny. You give the opportunity to thrive or to starve. Look at Nevada. The place is mostly desert, and the rest of it would probably be better off if the desert wiped it out, BUT, compared to a lot of other states, they are sitting relatively high on the fiscal hog.",

However, for the sake of these arguements, I would prefer us to have a discussion based on first principles, not in what is currently in the Constitution. After all, the Constitution can be changed with a significant enough majority.\n \nMaybe you could explain to me WHY some states are poorer than others, then we can look at why the government should be intervening to level that playing field.

That is a decision we made. Why should people in Illinois, who did chose to put up with the smoke stacks and pollution in return for more money, have to subsidize our decision in Kansas?? \n\n Some differences between states' wealth arise due to differences in natural resources or other differences defined by nature - ex. Alaska and Texas benefit from oil, many Midwestern states have climates and soils suitable to agriculture, etc. Outside of natural resources differences, there are historical reasons why some states start off at a much lower level than others - ex. many Southern states that were primarily agrarian during plantation / slavery times, whose economies were devastated by the Civil War. It always takes capital to start sufficient growth in industry. If a state is poor to begin with, it is very difficult for it to generate enough of its own capital, which is why outside investment is so important. Yes, there are states that can pull investment, business and jobs away from other states by offering lower tax rates but that only goes so far. For example, if all states had the same low business tax, then how would the poor state draw new business. Alternatively, if enough poor states offer low business tax, then the growth per state slows. Also, the best talent does not purely determine its geographical location based on income tax but on quality of life (which is why, despite some migration, most high achievers in California choose to stay). Most people I know in my state of Maryland (and also when I lived in Massachusetts) stayed in the states because of quality of life, despite higher taxes. So, the opportunities for full economic equality for poor states (most of which are not too attractive to most high achievers) is not as rosy as you would portray. \n \nOR, it could do it the legal and constitutional way, which would be to stay out of it. If the government of California want to legalize marijuana, that has nothing at all to do with the federal government. If the state of nevada chooses to keep it illegal, and they catch somebody in possession of it who bought it in California, they can still arrest them for possession of marijuana. \n \n There are a LOT of things that are legal in some states and not in others.

Just because the federal governement gets involved in certain issues (ex. medical marijuana distribution) doesn't mean that \"the states should have NO authority\". For example, the federal government could set minimum criteria of control (be it even dictating that medical marijuana use require a doctor's perscription) and California could dictate all the rest of the details.\n \n I personally think that the federal government should be able to get involved for the sake of the majority of states to limit the negative effect one state has on most others. As an analogy, each member of a group of people (analogy to states forming a national group) can determine how they live their own lives, except when there is team effort needed or if the irresponsibility of one person can effect other members of the group. If one state behaves in a manner that can strongly negatively impact most other states (majority rules), then there is vested interest for group control (i.e. federal control) over that irresponsible individual.",

   "I agree that the founders were wise in writing the Constitution, but they could not predict all the changes that the future would bring. However, for the sake of these arguements, I would prefer us to have a discussion based on first principles, not in what is currently in the Constitution. After all, the Constitution can be changed with a significant enough majority.\n\n \n Which is why what they laid out in the constitution was a fairly broad framework. It laid out the basic powers of government and (in theory) ensures that all other powers remain with the people or the states, thus ensuring the maximum amount of representation. \n \n Then they went even a step further and recognized that if the world really changed THAT much that they may need to go a step further, so they included in the constitution a method for changing it. They went to great pains to ensure that the method in question would not be so difficult that it would never be accomplished, but made it hard enough that it would not be done on a whim. \n \n \nSome differences between states' wealth arise due to differences in natural resources or other differences defined by nature - ex. Alaska and Texas benefit from oil, many Midwestern states have climates and soils suitable to agriculture, etc. Outside of natural resources differences, there are historical reasons why some states start off at a much lower level than others - ex. many Southern states that were primarily agrarian during plantation / slavery times, whose economies were devastated by the Civil War. It always takes capital to start sufficient growth in industry. If a state is poor to begin with, it is very difficult for it to generate enough of its own capital, which is why outside investment is so important. Yes, there are states that can pull investment, business and jobs away from other states by offering lower tax rates but that only goes so far. For example, if all states had the same low business tax, then how would the poor state draw new business. Alternatively, if enough poor states offer low business tax, then the growth per state slows. Also, the best talent does not purely determine its geographical location based on income tax but on quality of life (which is why, despite some migration, most high achievers in California choose to stay). Most people I know in my state of Maryland (and also when I lived in Massachusetts) stayed in the states because of quality of life, despite higher taxes. So, the opportunities for full economic equality for poor states (most of which are not too attractive to most high achievers) is not as rosy as you would portray. \n\n \n Nevada makes Maryland and Massachusetts look like street corner beggars, and it is mostly a wasteland. Most of the southern states are in the \"new industrial belt\". Like Alabama, they realized that their policies were foolish and anti growth, so they changed them. Louisiana stopped treating oil companies like hated cousins. Alabama realized that taxing manufacturing plants into oblivion was not a smart idea, and that having a population of fools also did not help, so they changed their taxation and invested in what has become a model industrial education program. \n \n You work with what you have. \n \n \nYou are exaggerating my position and arguing extremes. Just because the federal governement gets involved in certain issues (ex. medical marijuana distribution) doesn't mean that \"the states should have NO authority\". For example, the federal government could set minimum criteria of control (be it even dictating that medical marijuana use require a doctor's perscription) and California could dictate all the rest of the details.\n \n I personally think that the federal government should be able to get involved for the sake of the majority of states to limit the negative effect one state has on most others. As an analogy, each member of a group of people (analogy to states forming a national group) can determine how they live their own lives, except when there is team effort needed or if the irresponsibility of one person can effect other members of the group. If one state behaves in a manner that can strongly negatively impact most other states (majority rules), then there is vested interest for group control (i.e. federal control) over that irresponsible individual.\n\n \n If the federal government is going to decide when they should or should not intervene, then the states have NO power because any time they do something the federal government does not like, the feds can just undo it. You are pretty much talking about giving them the authority to do what they are told. That is not power. That is subservience. \n \n The federal government is not supposed to have the power to set minimum standards. Its powers are listed in the constitution. If the people of California want to allow people to smoke pot in their state it is WRONG for the other states to tell them they cant. It has no impact on the people in those other states. It essentially boils down to mandating the behavior of others, who you do not know and will probably never know, on a whim.\n \n Frankly the argument that by \"allowing\" California to legalize pot will have a negative impact on other states because some individuals MAY illegally smuggle it across the state line is borderline ludicrous. That is literally the same as arguing that we should outlaw alcohol sales because people will drive drunk.",

   "Yeah, Alabama has done a lot in recent years but it will always big a poorer state than Virginia. It's simply the dynamics of where the state is and what environment is in. For example, West Virginia is not going to get a sea port anytime soon. \n Anyway, I think it gets back to the age old question of who do you help and who is the one doing the helping. We both agree that unemployment benefits is never a bad thing but it is a bad thing when you do it for two years. Student financial aid is never a bad thing but it may be a bad thing if you fund art majors with $50k in loans and wonder why they can't pay it back. So maybe you are right and states should each decide how they want to handle this. They are bound by fiscal responsibility so you know you'd get a fair shake.\n\n \n I still have to disagree.

Granted, the founding generation of Americans were more well read on civic issues than the average modern American, but even the apathetic and underinformed modern American has his/her limits in what politicians they will keep voting in. Couple that with the checks and balances in the Constitution that exist in EITHER interpretation, and you have a pretty safe system. My main concern about our democracy is the power of money in influencing elections - exacerbated by the recent Supreme Court decisions to allow corporations to pay as much as they want. If we had an informed electorate that were willing to factcheck and think for themselves, such money wouldn't matter.

If so, then let me set the record straight. I do believe in Constitutional authority but do generally agree with the principle that the Constitution should be interpreted in context to try to determine the intent of the Constitutional text and how it apples to new conditions of a modern state. I understand that there are various interpretations of aspects such as the commerce clause that lead some (including yourself) to think that the federal governement has completely superceded its Constitutional mandate but, so far, the Supreme Court (the third balance of power) seems to disagree. In such disagreements on Constitutional interpretation, I simply agree to disagree with others. Personally, I feel fine leaving it to the Supreme Court to decide. I don't see much of a choice in the matter either way. \n \n Either way, since we have no power outside of our votes indirectly affecting Supreme Court justices and their decisions on such issues or our votes affecting legislative choices in changing the Constitution, I prefer to discuss first principles. \n \nNevada makes Maryland and Massachusetts look like street corner beggars, and it is mostly a wasteland. Most of the southern states are in the \"new industrial belt\". Like Alabama, they realized that their policies were foolish and anti growth, so they changed them. Louisiana stopped treating oil companies like hated cousins. Alabama realized that taxing manufacturing plants into oblivion was not a smart idea, and that having a population of fools also did not help, so they changed their taxation and invested in what has become a model industrial education program. \n \n You work with what you have. \n\n Under what stretch of the imagination can you say \"Nevada makes Maryland and Massachusetts look like street corner beggars\". Here is a link to the median household income per state: List of U.S. states by income - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n Maryland is first at $69,272, Massachusetts is sixth at $64,081, Nevada is 18th at $53,341. So, Maryland has a 30% higher median household income than Nevada - who is the \"street corner beggar\" in this scenario? (yes, I am also exaggerating). I also find it interesting that you chose Nevada as the representative of states with poor natural environments since Nevada has very clearly benefited from its very unique niche as the nation's playland for otherwise illegal activities - gambling and prositution. Most of the other geographically disadvantaged states (the Dakotas, Nebraska, etc.) are farther down on the list.\n \n Other things to note from this list is that the Southern States dominate the low end and, though they may be improving, the rate of their improvement does not seem to be lifting them up significantly out of those low rungs. From 2004-2006 to 2009, Marylands median household income rose ~11% ($69272 vs $62372) while Alabama's rose just ~5% ($40,489 vs $38,473). The trends do not seem to be moving in the right direction, despite you praise of Alabama's change in tax structure. Even Lousiana, which seemed to be the \"most improved\" of the Southern lot, had median household incomes increase by ~12% ($42,492 vs $37,943) - barely above that of Maryland. If even the by far best performing Souther State (in increase in household income) barely outpace a rich state's growth, then how can the states ever even out their income? Indeed, most of the Southern states seemed to have slower growth rates than most of the rest of the US states - making their lot even worse.\n \nIf the federal government is going to decide when they should or should not intervene, then the states have NO power because any time they do something the federal government does not like, the feds can just undo it.

Again, just because I do not want to discuss the details of Constitutional interpretation doesn't mean that I do not think that the federal government should not be restricted by Constitutional power. I just think that, if the federal powers were so obviously distant from the Constitution, then the Supreme Court would have voted on limiting such powers.",

   "Because pretty much the only reason to reform SS is to avoid repayment of the trillion $s in US government bonds in the trust fund.\n \n SS works pretty much like every other pension fund and in truth is better capitalized than most. Current workers pay for the benefits of retired workers, with a substantial reserve fund to even out demographic irregularities (the baby boomers in this case). The reserve fund for SS is the SS trust fund, which by federal law is held in special treasury bonds. \n \n SS is actually entirely self funded. It does not cost the federal government a dime. When you hear about the \"cost\" of SS to the government, or that it will \"cost\" us so much in ten years, what they are talking about is repaying the bonds in the trust fund. They are NOT actually talking about SS requiring money out of the federal budget to operate....merely that we repay the bonds we issued as they mature. \n \n THAT is why other nations are watching how we handle our SS situation. If I owed you $200,000 and you hear that I just defaulted on a $200,000 loan from my father, you would probably be pretty concerned about the odds of you getting your money back, and rightly so.\n\n My understanding is that the Social Security trust fund is not supported by treasury bonds that are taken up by foreign or private entities. They are \"special\" treasury bonds which essentially are composed of the government borrowing from itself. It is an accounting trick which has led many to question whether or not the trust fund is real or simply an artificial accounting construct. \n \n So, if we default on those bonds, which foreign entity or private firm are we hurting since none of those bonds are held by a foreign entity or private firm? Perhaps there is a paranoia that would be introduced that, if we default on the trust fund special bonds then we could default on real bonds. However, I would hope that any country making such a decision would have economists that could point out that a government borrowing from itself is very different than a government borrowing from a foreign country. \n \n Social Security and Medicare need to be paid for either way, as do all the other programs that make up the federal budget. Once Social Security and Medicare tax income becomes smaller than their costs (which will become increasingly true after 2012), then the government will have to either pay itself back to pay for the excess (maintaining the pretense that there actually is a REAL trust fund out there) or realize that the trust fund no longer exists and either increase SS and Medicare taxes, reduce benefits or both in order to keep it paying for itself without the trust fund, or treat it as we treat any other item that is not paying for itself - pay for it by borrowing with the usual type of treasury bills.\n \n The bottom line is that whenever a government borrows from itself (as in this case), I call that an accounting trick. So far, it is not borrowing from foreign states to finance SS and Medicare. My main concern is that, without a SS and Medicare yearly surplus (which disappears after 2012) and, indeed, with a net yearly SS and Medicare deficit, our overall federal budget deficit problem becomes that much worse. That is the only way in which I view foreign holders of US debt as having reason to worry. We need to get our deficits under control if we want foreign countries to lend us money. I don't think they care as much about what accounting tricks we use or do not use. It is our ability to pay for our own spending through taxes that makes them question our resolve and self-control.\n \n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n \n As a side note, I personally would prefer us to at least maintain the pretense that the trust fund exists since paying it back will be a constant reminder to Congress about how out-of-control our deficits have been over the last decade on...",

Though there are similarities (in that it is a fund held in bonds and it helps fund support for seniors) there are clear differences. Mostly, the pension funds that I know of are not funded purely by employees and held by the company. Also, company pension funds do not have to be self-supporting by employee funding, as Social Security is expected to be (net money from taxpayers/employees coming in equals net money to seniors coming out, with the fund acting as a buffer for fluctuations). Company pension funds are simply an extra benefit that companies give outside of an employee's salary. It is a future promise to employees that it organizes through a fund. Traditional pension funds are not composed of the money that the employees put into it themselves. (401K funds are another issue since they ARE composed mainly of employees' money but I understand that they are handled differently).\n \n We taxpayers are the ones paying for Social Security and if we expect it to be solvent long term then we should expect to PAY for it to be solvent. Namely, if the money I pay into Social Security was based on an average life expectancy of 75 (so that the average senior would need 10 years of support), then why should I expect that this will keep SS solvent when average life expectancies are 80? I can only expect to get what I pay for - at least on a group basis (employees at my salary level have SS taxes that subsidize poorer workers' retirement and we ultimately only get ~ 70% of what we put into SS). So, I think the government has every right to reduce our benefits (ex. increase retirement age) or increase SS taxes in order to keep SS solvent long term. After all, it is our responsibility as a people to pay for our own social programs. Government money doesn't grow on trees - it comes from us and SS solvency is OUR responsibility. We need to pay for what we get.\n \n Now, when it comes to the SS trust fund, other issues come up. On the one hand, if you judge SS independently from anything else the government does, then it should stay solvent until sometime around 2060 (last I heard) because the trust fund was meant to carry us through population fluctuations such as that of the baby boomers. However, its lack of solvency after ~2060 is largely due demographic changes such as increased lifespan. Such changes in demographics need to be handled through changes in benefits and/or SS taxes. However, what do we do about the fact that the trust fund has been spent? If it was someone else who spent it, then I would demand that money back since (as in 401K funds), it was OUR money through SS taxes that paid for it. However, WE were the ones that spent it. That is what complicates the issue. Our relative responsibility in paying for SS (since it is good through 2060) is countered by our strong irresponsibility in not paying for other programs. So, one way or another, WE have to pay for our net irresponsibility. \n \n Many European countries have shown irresponsibility in not paying for their social programs through taxes. Other countries seem to be applauding their reduction in benefits, not criticizing them for defaulting on a promise. In our case, we need to decide for ourselves what level of responsibility a society has towards its people in terms of senior care. The great majority of Americans seem to support the idea of such a societal responsibility and support SS, though most also fear for its solvency. What we have to do as a people is be realistic about the costs of such a social program and pay for its solvency, while keeping a watchfull eye that the tools of its solvency (such as the trust fund) don't get lost. To do that, we need to be responsible over ALL of our public spending. After all, WE are the ones who are responsible for the trust fund being wasted.",

So, call it whatever you like, but, on its own merit, it is well enough designed as a program that it has lasted for generations and will continue to last for generations if untouched or only slightly modified - not too shabby at all for what you are calling a \"ponzi scheme\". I wish that all programs we fund were that well organized. Our country would have negligible financial concerns.\n \n Unfortunately, most programs are not as well organized and most government programs outside of SS (from the military to national parks to highways, etc.) are not sufficiently paid for by taxes. THAT is the problem. We have screwed ourselves up by irresponsible spending/taxing on the other programs that the government runs and have tried to hide some of those screw ups by messing with SS. SS costs will continue to rise, which will be a problem for deficits, but it is unfair to blame the Social Security program for our increasing deficit problems since it was overspending/undertaxing on OTHER programs that caused us to steal from its trust fund. SS had solutions to its increasing baby boomer spending &#8211; the trust fund. Don&#8217;t blame SS for the fact that we screwed up its solution (the trust fund) by taking from it.\n \n SS is not to blame for the problems its increasing costs will cause since it HAD a solution that we screwed up. Nevertheless, we will still have to pay more and more for SS over the next years due to baby boomers retiring. Since we no longer have the trust fund to count on (not in REAL money, just in money we shifted as debt to other parts of the government), we will have to pay for that somehow. If we pay for it through cashing in the special bonds, then that has to be paid for by increasing general taxes or taking on even larger deficits by borrowing the money. Alternatively, we can choose to see the trust fund as no longer existing in real money, cancel the &#8220;special&#8221; bonds associated with it, and pay for the increasing SS costs with either increased SS taxes or borrowing.\n \n No matter what, the net result is that as long as we don&#8217;t reduce our spending, we will either have to continuously increase taxes or have larger and larger deficits to pay for increased SS costs. It is important to note again that SS was not to blame for this &#8211; the other irresponsible spending was &#8211; but that doesn&#8217;t change our current reality. With increasing costs, what is our solution &#8211; Tax more? Spend less? Keep borrowing? These are the decisions we will have to make as a nation in the coming years and decades.",

   "again, you seem to be suggesting that social security could be good if it weren't bad. It is very similar to a pension plan and but one that invests directly into its own company. This is all by design. \n\n I never said that Social Security was bad, you did. I have been saying that SS was a well designed program that we screwed up to hide our lack of responsibilty in other areas. Pension funds in well run companies work. When companies are run badly, they steal from their pension funds to hide some of their bad financial management. That is what happened here. We CHOSE to act like a badly run company. That was never an unavoidable destiny.\n \nIt does seem we are getting away from the point though. With social security, cutting benefits or raising the SS tax will not solve the problem (although raising the tax will admittedly delay it). Those bonds still have to be paid back and that means cuts in other areas or larger deficits. If we default on those bonds than it brings concerns about continuing to get funding from other countries which right now is necessary for our spending levels.\n\n Most countries seem to be applauding the reduction in benefits in Greece, the UK, etc, because they see these cuts as making the countries more solvent. Could you please comment on that - i.e. why that is not viewed as a breach of promise as you are saying it would be viewed if the US did it.",

If it were acting like a well functioning company, it would save money on the side to pay those bonds off when they came due. That was not the case. The net result is that, assuming all other spending remains constant, increasing SS costs will have to result in increased taxes or increased debt.\n \n - - - - - - -\n \n Meanwhile, in thinking about the impact of rising SS costs, it made me wonder exactly how large those increases will be. Most of the time, SS is grouped together with Medicare and Medicaid and the sum of the expected cost increases for those programs is expected to be large enough to potentially cause our debt to be unstable (barring any reduction in benefits or increases in taxes). So, I checked into what the SS portion of the growth will be and it turns out that it will not be so bad - the rise in health care costs along with debt servicing dominates. Here is a link (from Social Security and the Budget ) :\n \nAlmost every investigation of the nation&#8217;s longterm budget tells a similar story: the nation is not on a sustainable path. But how closely is that budget story related to Social Security? Many budget projections start with basic spending data on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, interest costs that arise with increased debt, and everything else&#8212;and then calculate future deficits that arise when that spending is compared to revenues. Relative to the projected increases in deficits and spending, the growth in Social Security costs is moderate. Health care cost growth, along with rising interest payments on growing debt, dominate the spending numbers, while revenues fall far short of what is necessary to meet projected total spending under current laws. For instance, Social Security costs are projected to rise by about 2 percentage points of America&#8217;s gross domestic product (GDP) from about 2007 to 2030, while health costs rise much more.\n\n \n The link also talks about the need for change in SS funding due to changes in demographics - i.e. people living longer and smaller birth rates (the second is a point I hadn't yet considered but it does add to the problem). These define the long-term sustainability of SS and how we need to reconsider benefits and SS taxes. In the shorter term, baby boom retirement is the main cause of increase.",

   "Tim Koelkebeck: Is the Religious Right Taking Over the Tea Party?\n \n Excerpts: \nMyType, a psychographic opinion research firm of which I am CEO, surveyed over 17,000 Americans about the Tea Party to reveal the demographics, values, morals and personalities of the movement's supporters. The survey data suggest that the movement is in the middle of an identity crisis. Devoutly religious conservatives comprise 22.5% of the Tea Party and are its fastest growing segment. They bring with them a fundamentally different set of values, morals and personalities than libertarian supporters, a core group that represent 17% of the party. While the former tend to be morally charged, family-oriented traditionalists, many libertarian supporters are neither religious nor traditional. Rather, they are independent, intellectual, and morally permissive.\n \n The rising prominence of religious conservatives within the movement, highlighted by recent religious right rhetoric from several prominent figures affiliated with the Tea Party, appears to be driving away libertarians and others. Despite the surge in support from religious conservatives, overall support for the Tea Party is in decline. \n \n <snip<\n \n Though religious conservative and libertarian Tea Party supporters may seem similar on the surface, their underlying values, morals and personalities are fundamentally different . . . Both tend to be white, well-educated, middle or upper middle class parents, and are more likely to live in the South. Religious conservative supporters, however, are often down-to-earth, traditional, and morally charged, while libertarian supporters tend to be intellectual, self-directed and morally permissive.\n \n It seems unlikely that these distinct groups can remain united under one political banner. And indeed, the rise of religious conservatives and decline of libertarians within the Tea Party indicate a brewing identity crisis for the movement. The Tea Party protests began with the core libertarian values still listed on the party's official website: fiscal responsibility, constitutionally limited government, and free markets. Notably absent is any mention of social issues. Recently, however, prominent political candidates and public figures affiliated with the party have made headlines with their statements on social issues: Christine O'Donnell opposes all abortions except if the mother is going to die, New York gubernatorial Carl Paladino asserts that homosexuality is \"not an equally valid or successful option\", and The Huffington Post just reported yesterday that senatorial candidate Ken Buck \"disagree[s] strongly with the concept of separation of church and state\", echoing comments made by Christine O'Donnell just last week. While this seems to be attracting religious conservatives to the Tea Party, it's likely driving away socially permissive libertarians and others who originally joined the movement for its focus on scaling back government. Involving the government in moral prescription is expanding its influence, not scaling back. Karl Denninger, widely credited as one of the founders of the Tea Party, may have become the spokesman of Tea Party defectors when he recently denounced the movement, saying it has been hijacked by people obsessed with \"guns, gays and God\".\n Graphs, tables, and more info about the survey can be seen at the website.",
