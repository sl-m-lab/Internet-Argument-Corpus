   "\"This paper reports on the first State-by-State analysis of firearm theft and crime, with the intention of alerting policymakers, law enforcement, gun stores, firearms manufacturers, and families to the facts that gun theft is common and preventable and has serious consequences.\"\n \n This is some thing that is not known perhaps? Otherwise its an exercise in puffery.\n \n The study found that 1.7 million firearms were stolen from homes and elsewhere over the period between January 1993 and August 2002, and these thefts varied widely from State to State. \n \n Did we note the else where and no distinction between homes and there?\n \n The States of Alaska, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, New Mexico, and Georgia had firearm theft rates greater than twice the national average. \n \n The real question is firearm density. Was it greater or lesser in these states? Failure to prove cause and effect big time.\n \n Firearm theft rates were dramatically lower in States with safe storage laws. \n \n Of course the methodology is left out of the abstract, why? Is it flawed like that of Martin Killias?\n \n Licensed gun stores were also targets of theft. \n \n Oh a quantity of firearms there no suprise.\n \n The stolen guns have fueled the black market in crime guns. Although Federal law has targeted gun thefts, violations of this law are rarely prosecuted. \n \n So a fault in the criminal justice system is supposed to make us all liable? Why aren't they prosecuted?\n \n The Americans for Gun Safety Foundation will soon launch a public-education campaign through licensed firearms dealers to encourage gun owners to properly store firearms to prevent theft. \n \n Oh joy a gun grabber group is going to lecture us. \n \n Pawnshops and licensed gun dealers should first be permitted, and then required, to check all used firearms they purchase through the FBI's Stolen Gun File Registry to determine whether the guns they are purchasing are stolen. \n \n Seems to me this should already be in place. \n \n U.S. attorneys should aggressively enforce Federal gun laws and investigate and prosecute stolen firearms cases. \n \n Why aren't they already? See above for rarely prosecuted. No new laws needed here.\n \n Also, gun-lock manufacturers should develop safety locks that cannot easily be defeated by a criminal, such that a stolen gun with a proper lock cannot be used. \n \n Gee are you going to persecute them if they fail?\n \n High-quality gun locks, or an alternative storage device, should be sold as a requirement of each firearm sale. \n \n Isn't that part of the Brady bill? Here in this state they include it whether you want it or not.\n \n Finally, States and the Federal Government should consider passing safe-storage laws as a means to reduce firearm theft. \n \n So far you have laws against theft that aren't being prosecuted. Thefts from law enforcement that go unpunished. Yet this gun grabber group of drooling nit wits wants more laws that attack the law abiding. Seems to me if you get caught with a stolen firearm if they cut off your hands and harvest your eyes that would be more of a deterrent. ",

   "Published Thursday, October 30, 2008\n \n GATES - Additional information is now available regarding a joint operation in North Carolina and Virginia that led to the arrests of numerous individuals on stolen weapons charges.\n \n The story first broke Wednesday night on Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald | Serving the Roanoke-Chowan Community since 1914 where, armed to the hilt, a contingent of nearly 40 law enforcement officers from various agencies conducted simultaneous raids at four Gates County residences late Wednesday afternoon, all apparently linked to a rash of gun thefts in the county since mid-April.\n \n Gates County Sheriff Ed Webb reported that the raids in his county netted the arrest of Robert M. Paris, 24 of Gates, who stands charged with possession of a firearm by felon,\n \n possession of a sawed off shotgun and conspiracy to commit a felony. It was also reported that Jordan Hyatt was arrested, but his charges are unknown at this time.\n \n Meanwhile, Suffolk, Va. Police conducted a \"buy-bust\" of three individuals in a parking lot of that city around 5:45 p.m. on Wednesday. Arrested there were Dominique Wilkins, 18, Rashawn Goodman, 20, and 29-year-old Anton Harrison, all of Gates.\n \n Wilkins faces numerous federal charges lodged by the ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms). Charges of possession of a firearm by a felon, receive stolen property, sale of stolen guns, two counts of conspiracy to commit a\n \n felony and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute were filed against Goodman. Harrison's charges were possession of a bullet proof vest and conspiracy to commit a felony.\n \n The raids in Gates County were conducted at residences on US 13 North, NC 37 in Gates, Sarem Road and Hackney Road. Webb said a sawed off shotgun, cocaine and marijuana were recovered during the execution of their search warrants in reference to this operation. Two females were also arrested and charged with aiding and abetting.\n \n Sheriff Webb said the raids in his county as well as the Suffolk arrests were all connected to a series of weapons thefts. Those thefts have occurred in Gates County, Hertford County and Pasquotank County as well as in Suffolk, Va. Pistols, shotguns, high-powered hunting rifles and civilian model assault weapons appeared to be popular among the thieves.\n \n \"This has been an ongoing investigation for the past six months,\" Webb said. \"We have been working closely with the Suffolk Police on this as well as the federal ATF folks.\"\n \n Webb said other arrests are pending. He added that the investigation revealed that the weapons stolen in Gates County were altered by scratching off the serial numbers and then enter into the illegal gun trade market. Most of those weapons found their way into Virginia, according to the Sheriff.\n \n \"From there we believe these weapons have made their way up into the New Jersey and New York area,\" Webb said.\n \n At 4 p.m. Wednesday afternoon, a small army of law enforcement officers gathered at the Hertford County Emergency Management office near Winton to map out their final strategy before making the raids. There, Sheriff Webb issued a warning to those gathered to \"be very careful because these guys we're after are armed.\"\n \n Webb added that those being sought for the rash of thefts all have federal and state (North Carolina and Virginia) felony warrants filed against them.\n Dividing into four, eight-person teams (plus a fifth squad as back-up), the raids in Gates County went off without major incident. There was a pit bull shot and killed by officers after they entered a residence at 946 NC 37 in Gates.\n \n \"Upon entering that residence, the officers were confronted by a pit bull,\" Webb said. \"After a verbal command failed to scare off the dog, one shot was fired (apparently in the floor) in an effort to frighten the dog, but the dog continued to advance towards the officers in a threatening manner so there was no other recourse than to shoot the animal.\"\n \n Several other dogs were safely removed from that residence.\n \n Joining the Gates County Sheriff's Office were lawmen representing the Ahoskie Police Department, Chowan County Sheriff's Office, Hertford County Sheriff's Office, Perquimans County Sheriff's Office, ATF, ALE, Gates County Probation and Parole, NC Wildlife and NC Highway Patrol.\n \n \"Our main focus here was to work this case where the stolen weapons were crossing state lines,\" said ATF Resident Agent in Charge Teresa Merhige. \"This was a well-orchestrated raid...the timing was perfect. This says a lot about how well the different agencies can come together as one.\"\n \n During the course of the operation, the agencies coordinated the purchase of a bulletproof vest and eight firearms, which included an AR-15 assault rifle, two 22 caliber pistols, two sawed off shotguns, one 243 caliber\n \n hunting rifle with scope, one 22 caliber rifle and a 45 caliber pistol.\n \n Gee who would have thunk it, career criminals.",

Tucker | The Saginaw News February 21, 2008 09:50AM\n Categories: Court news, police news\n With seven people in jail, law enforcement officials from two counties say they've caught the primary culprits in the theft of 200 firearms from a Sanford gun dealer.\n \n \"We have the main players,\" Midland County Sheriff Jerry Nielsen said. \"If others are involved, we will deal with them as we find them.\"\n \n Some of the guns stolen in the Midland County heist remain missing.\n \n Sometime after the gun shop closed Feb. 6 and reopened Feb. 7, someone cut the burglar alarm wire and forced open the door to Joe Gun, 152 E. Saginaw, and made off with the cache -- about 130 rifles worth $80,000, 70 handguns valued at $12,000 and several thousand dollars worth of ammunition, police said.\n \n Saginaw County sheriff's deputies arrested four suspects Monday and Tuesday and recovered a half-dozen firearms plus drugs and burglary tools they said the burglars used in the break-in.\n \n Midland County sheriff's deputies arrested three people and recovered 150 firearms while executing three search warrants between midnight Tuesday and 10:45 a.m. Wednesday. They also searched another home with permission from the occupants.\n \n Midland County deputies seized about 90 percent of the recovered guns from a residence in Greendale Township where no one was home. They also used warrants to search homes in Jerome and Lee townships. They arrested one man at each place and found guns at the Lee Township home.\n \n Deputies also went to a Mount Haley Township home, arresting a man there and recovering some firearms.\n \n While Saginaw County District Judge Terry L. Clark has arraigned a Chesaning couple and a Saginaw man on charges of stealing or possessing stolen firearms, the Midland men -- a 20-year-old and two \u000723-year-olds, from Midland, Sanford and Mount Haley Township -- are awaiting arraignment dates in their home county.\n \n Clark on Wednesday conducted video arraignments for Michael A. Louchart, 33, and his girlfriend, Geri L. McClure, 22, both of Chesaning on multiple felony charges. Court records show that Louchart and McClure live at 156 Meadowood, an apartment complex in the village's north end.\n \n The judge set bonds of $1.4 million for Louchart and $850,000 for McClure.\n Clark said the bonds are high because of \"the serious nature and danger\" the pair pose to the community.\n \n During the hearing, Louchart, attempted to minimize McClure's involvement.\n \"Ms. McClure didn't have anything to do with this,\" he said. \"I'm not saying nothing that's not true.\"\n \n Clark interrupted Louchart and reminded him that prosecutors could use anything he said against him.\n \n Clark also arraigned Wayne F. Parcham, 20, of 613 Cleveland on charges of receiving or concealing three of the stolen firearms. The judge set a $375,000 bond for Parcham.\n The three suspects will have a Wednesday, March 5, preliminary examination before Clark.\n \n Prosecutors charged Louchart and McClure with continuing a criminal enterprise, receiving or concealing stolen firearms, possessing burglar's tools and three counts of possessing a firearm while committing a felony.\n \n Louchart faces an additional charge of possessing a firearm as a felon.\n \n The fourth person arrested, Matthew J. Soule, 32, of St. Charles Township has not faced arraignment yet.",

   "The Hidden Agenda Behind Gun Storage Laws By David Kopel\n In Canada and Great Britain deceitful \"safe storage\" laws allow government invasion of gun owners` homes. \n These laws are all part of the gun grabbers` wholesale attack on private gun ownership.\n Responsible gun owners store their guns safely. For over a century, the National Rifle Association and other civic groups have done everything they can to encourage safe gun storage.\n \n Partly as a result, the fatal gun accident rate for both kids and adults has fallen to an all-time low. In spite of this, anti-gun politicians, and the anti-gun groups are working to turn \"safe storage\" into a tool for disarming the American public.\n Gun owners who think they have nothing to lose from a government takeover of gun storage should look at what has happened in countries such as Canada and Great Britain. There, gun owner apathy has allowed \"safe storage\" to become the platform for abolishing gun ownership for home protection, for invading the privacy and the homes of gun owners, and for attacking even the simple possession of firearms.\n \n Great Britain\n British gun owners have a long tradition of going along with government proposals for \"reasonable\" restrictions on their rights. But as many Britons found out too late, a restriction that appears reasonable on paper may become quite unreasonable in practice.\n \n British law merely mandates that guns be stored in \"a secure place.\" But Britain has a national gun licensing system, similar to the American system proposed by Sarah Brady of Handgun Control, Inc. Because most police administrators in Britain are intensely opposed to citizens owning guns, they use the storage law to make acquiring a gun license as onerous as possible.\n \n \n If you want to obtain or renew a gun license in Britain, two police officers will visit your home to scrutinize your gun security system. Although the law, even today, does not order guns to be locked in a safe, the police routinely compel gun owners to purchase safes--sometimes two safes, the second one for separate storage of ammunition. A person buying a low-powered L5 rimfire rifle may have to spend \u00a3100 on a safe. A person with five guns may be ordered to add a \u00a31000 electronic security system.\n \n \n One effect of the heavy security costs is to reduce the ability of middle-income or poor people to legally own guns, a goal which has been a constant objective of gun control proponents throughout history. Of course, the requirement that guns be locked in safes makes it nearly impossible for the gun to be used for home protection and the British police establishment despises the idea of defensive gun ownership.\n \n \n If you want to obtain or renew a gun license in Britain, two police officers will visit your home to scrutinize your gun security system. \n \n \n The requirement that gun owners purchase safes was never democratically enacted by the British Parliament. Rather, the requirement was invented by police administrators, who correctly recognized that any system requiring government permission to buy a gun can be manipulated by anti-gun administrators. (Similarly, in the United States, police administrators have used the Brady Act to deny handgun purchases by thousands of people with unpaid traffic tickets or other trivial offenses. Brady does not formally sanction such abuses, but by requiring government permission for handgun purchases, the Act makes such abuses inevitable.)\n \n Canada\n In Canada, the Criminal Code prohibits \"careless\" storage of a firearm, and gives the government the authority to create storage regulations. What does this mean in practice? Consider some cases from 1996 and 1997:\n \n Hearing suspicious sounds, perhaps from a burglar, a husband took his unloaded rifle with him one night when he looked around his house. A few days later, the wife told a friend about the incident. Aghast, the friend called the police.\n \n The police arrived at the couple`s home and bullied their way in. Searching the home, they found the unloaded rifle under a mattress in the bedroom. No children lived in the home. The couple was charged with careless storage of a firearm.\n \n A 67-year-old single woman ran a small boarding house in Ontario. A downstairs tenant began harassing and stalking her. Worried that the woman might pose a threat to the tenant, the police searched her apartment and found several unloaded guns in her closets. She was convicted of storage of a firearm in violation of government regulations. She had been attending school and studying to become a paralegal, but her conviction will bar her from a job in the legal field.\n \n Recently in Winnipeg, a 72-year-old woman called a hospital to request that a visiting nurse come over and help her with some medication. Someone from the hospital asked if the woman had any firearms in the home. \"Yes,\" she replied, \"my husband has a couple of old hunting rifles down in the rec room.\"\n \n The police came over immediately and began searching the home. They found several long guns, each with a trigger lock and locked to a rack in the basement. They also found a .25 caliber pistol locked in a bedroom closet, which they had broken into.\n \n The 73-year-old husband came home in the middle of the search, and was immediately handcuffed, and accused of being violent. Other than the fact that he owned guns, there was no evidence that he was violent. (His neighbors later signed statements saying they had known him for years, and he had always been peaceful.) Eventually the police removed the handcuffs, and told the man that he had never been under arrest. \n \n Gun storage laws sometimes provide a means for police to justify outrageously bad police work. In Medicine Hat, Alberta, a criminal who had charges pending against him tried to buy leniency by claiming that a man named Larry Davies was a marijuana dealer, with over a pound in his house. The Medicine Hat police did nothing to verify the informant`s claim, other than looking up Larry Davies` address in the phone book.\n \n The SWAT team, apparently having nothing else to do that day, broke into the Davies household, and forced Larry Davies and three friends to the floor, pointing submachine guns at their heads. A search of the house revealed: Mrs. Davies and her newborn baby, who had come home from the hospital that day; four grams of marijuana (weighing less than a United States 25-cent piece); and a disassembled FN/FAL rifle in a basement closet.\n \n Apparently embarrassed but not repentant about the sloppy police practices and wanton show of force, the government charged Mr. Davies with unsafe storage of a firearm. Happily, a judge threw the charges out of court, noting that whatever Mr. Davies had done was much less of a threat to society than what the police had done.\n \n And Canadian courts have sometimes stopped other abusive prosecutions related to gun storage laws. But even then, the victim of the abusive prosecution must spend thousands of dollars in legal fees to avoid a prison sentence of up to two years.\n \n As David Tomlinson, President of Canada`s National Firearms Association, points out, gun storage laws are unenforceable without random police searches of the home. Canada`s newest gun law, which goes into effect next year, gives the police the authority to \"inspect\" private homes to ensure that gun storage laws are being complied with.\n \n Gun storage laws are like laws barring married couples from using birth control: they are unenforceable without massive government intrusions into the sanctity of the home. In 1965, the United States Supreme Court struck down a birth control ban for this very reason. (Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965)). For the same reason, privacy-minded legislators and citizens should reject turning the government into the home gun storage enforcer.\n \n \n Former-President Clinton, by the way, effusively praised the new Canadian gun law (Bill C-68) which authorizes searches without probable cause.\n \n \n SMALL STEPS\n Gun prohibition almost always moves by incremental steps. Restrictions that would have seemed outrageous if proposed by themselves can appear \"reasonable\" when they merely advance existing restrictions a few more steps.\n \n Gun storage laws are. . . unenforceable without massive government intrusions into the sanctity of the home. \n \n In Canada, prohibitionists, such as then-Justice Minister Alan Rock, have used gun storage laws as a justification for imposing universal gun registration, since registration \"will create a sense of accountability on the part of the firearms owner to comply with some of the safe storage laws that are in effect.\"\n \n As the next step, the anti-gun lobbies in Canada have begun pushing for \"community storage.\" Rather than keeping your guns in a safe in your home, you would have to keep your guns at a police station. When you wanted to use your gun for the day, you could check it out from the police station.\n The anti-gun groups point out that a gun in the home could be stolen, or could be misused in a domestic incident. There is no reason, they argue, for guns to be kept in a home 365 days a year, when the gun may only be used a few days a year.\n \n To counter the anti-gun groups, gun owners in Canada can hardly argue that removing guns from the home makes it impossible to use the guns for home defense. They gave up the moral case for self-defense years ago by arguing that gun ownership was justified for sporting purposes, but not daring to assert that gun ownership is justified for defensive purposes. And by agreeing to \"safe storage\" laws, the Canadian gun owners gave up the practical ability to use a gun for self-defense in a sudden emergency.\n \n With so much ground already conceded, Canadian gun owners are reduced to arguing minor points, such as how a centralized gun storage repository might be more vulnerable to theft.\n \n Even conceding on the \"community storage\" issue will do gun owners no good. In 1996, the British Parliament banned almost all handguns, but allowed owners of single-shot .22s to keep the guns locked in central repositories at gun ranges. The new restrictions only briefly sated the appetite of the British anti-gun lobbies. In 1997, community storage was replaced by its logical consequence, complete prohibition of all handguns.\n \n The Future\n Who can believe that the right to keep and bear arms could survive \"community storage,\" with gun owners needing to ask government bureaucrats for permission to obtain access to their own guns? Who can believe that the American anti-gun lobbies, who so consistently imitate the programs of their foreign cousins, will not begin demanding community storage, once they have laid the foundation with \"safe storage\" laws?\n \n Storing guns safely is the duty of every gun owner. What makes for safety depends very much on individual circumstances. Safety is, and always has been, the concern of organizations such as the National Rifle Association. In the hands of anti-gun lobbies and government bureaucrats, though, \"safe storage\" becomes an Orwellian term designed to negate the many safety benefits of the right to bear arms. Home safety is the responsibility of the family, not the state.\n \n Sources: Some material herein is from Dave Kopel`s award-winning book The Samurai, the Mountie, and the Cowboy: Should America Adopt the Gun Control Policies of Other Democracies?

   "Published Thursday, October 30, 2008\n \n GATES - Additional information is now available regarding a joint operation in North Carolina and Virginia that led to the arrests of numerous individuals on stolen weapons charges.\n \n The story first broke Wednesday night on Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald | Serving the Roanoke-Chowan Community since 1914 where, armed to the hilt, a contingent of nearly 40 law enforcement officers from various agencies conducted simultaneous raids at four Gates County residences late Wednesday afternoon, all apparently linked to a rash of gun thefts in the county since mid-April.\n \n Gates County Sheriff Ed Webb reported that the raids in his county netted the arrest of Robert M. Paris, 24 of Gates, who stands charged with possession of a firearm by felon,\n \n possession of a sawed off shotgun and conspiracy to commit a felony. It was also reported that Jordan Hyatt was arrested, but his charges are unknown at this time.\n \n Meanwhile, Suffolk, Va. Police conducted a \"buy-bust\" of three individuals in a parking lot of that city around 5:45 p.m. on Wednesday. Arrested there were Dominique Wilkins, 18, Rashawn Goodman, 20, and 29-year-old Anton Harrison, all of Gates.\n \n Wilkins faces numerous federal charges lodged by the ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms). Charges of possession of a firearm by a felon, receive stolen property, sale of stolen guns, two counts of conspiracy to commit a\n \n felony and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute were filed against Goodman. Harrison's charges were possession of a bullet proof vest and conspiracy to commit a felony.\n \n The raids in Gates County were conducted at residences on US 13 North, NC 37 in Gates, Sarem Road and Hackney Road. Webb said a sawed off shotgun, cocaine and marijuana were recovered during the execution of their search warrants in reference to this operation. Two females were also arrested and charged with aiding and abetting.\n \n Sheriff Webb said the raids in his county as well as the Suffolk arrests were all connected to a series of weapons thefts. Those thefts have occurred in Gates County, Hertford County and Pasquotank County as well as in Suffolk, Va. Pistols, shotguns, high-powered hunting rifles and civilian model assault weapons appeared to be popular among the thieves.\n \n \"This has been an ongoing investigation for the past six months,\" Webb said. \"We have been working closely with the Suffolk Police on this as well as the federal ATF folks.\"\n \n Webb said other arrests are pending. He added that the investigation revealed that the weapons stolen in Gates County were altered by scratching off the serial numbers and then enter into the illegal gun trade market. Most of those weapons found their way into Virginia, according to the Sheriff.\n \n \"From there we believe these weapons have made their way up into the New Jersey and New York area,\" Webb said.\n \n At 4 p.m. Wednesday afternoon, a small army of law enforcement officers gathered at the Hertford County Emergency Management office near Winton to map out their final strategy before making the raids. There, Sheriff Webb issued a warning to those gathered to \"be very careful because these guys we're after are armed.\"\n \n Webb added that those being sought for the rash of thefts all have federal and state (North Carolina and Virginia) felony warrants filed against them.\n Dividing into four, eight-person teams (plus a fifth squad as back-up), the raids in Gates County went off without major incident. There was a pit bull shot and killed by officers after they entered a residence at 946 NC 37 in Gates.\n \n \"Upon entering that residence, the officers were confronted by a pit bull,\" Webb said. \"After a verbal command failed to scare off the dog, one shot was fired (apparently in the floor) in an effort to frighten the dog, but the dog continued to advance towards the officers in a threatening manner so there was no other recourse than to shoot the animal.\"\n \n Several other dogs were safely removed from that residence.\n \n Joining the Gates County Sheriff's Office were lawmen representing the Ahoskie Police Department, Chowan County Sheriff's Office, Hertford County Sheriff's Office, Perquimans County Sheriff's Office, ATF, ALE, Gates County Probation and Parole, NC Wildlife and NC Highway Patrol.\n \n \"Our main focus here was to work this case where the stolen weapons were crossing state lines,\" said ATF Resident Agent in Charge Teresa Merhige. \"This was a well-orchestrated raid...the timing was perfect. This says a lot about how well the different agencies can come together as one.\"\n \n During the course of the operation, the agencies coordinated the purchase of a bulletproof vest and eight firearms, which included an AR-15 assault rifle, two 22 caliber pistols, two sawed off shotguns, one 243 caliber\n \n hunting rifle with scope, one 22 caliber rifle and a 45 caliber pistol.\n \n Gee who would have thunk it, career criminals.\nWas this ring in the business of cracking gun safes?

Saginaw, and made off with the cache -- about 130 rifles worth $80,000, 70 handguns valued at $12,000 and several thousand dollars worth of ammunition, police said.\n \n Saginaw County sheriff's deputies arrested four suspects Monday and Tuesday and recovered a half-dozen firearms plus drugs and burglary tools they said the burglars used in the break-in.\n \n Midland County sheriff's deputies arrested three people and recovered 150 firearms while executing three search warrants between midnight Tuesday and 10:45 a.m. Wednesday. They also searched another home with permission from the occupants.\n \n Midland County deputies seized about 90 percent of the recovered guns from a residence in Greendale Township where no one was home. They also used warrants to search homes in Jerome and Lee townships. They arrested one man at each place and found guns at the Lee Township home.\n \n Deputies also went to a Mount Haley Township home, arresting a man there and recovering some firearms.\n \n While Saginaw County District Judge Terry L. Clark has arraigned a Chesaning couple and a Saginaw man on charges of stealing or possessing stolen firearms, the Midland men -- a 20-year-old and two \u000723-year-olds, from Midland, Sanford and Mount Haley Township -- are awaiting arraignment dates in their home county.\n \n Clark on Wednesday conducted video arraignments for Michael A. Louchart, 33, and his girlfriend, Geri L. McClure, 22, both of Chesaning on multiple felony charges. Court records show that Louchart and McClure live at 156 Meadowood, an apartment complex in the village's north end.\n \n The judge set bonds of $1.4 million for Louchart and $850,000 for McClure.\n Clark said the bonds are high because of \"the serious nature and danger\" the pair pose to the community.\n \n During the hearing, Louchart, attempted to minimize McClure's involvement.\n \"Ms. McClure didn't have anything to do with this,\" he said. \"I'm not saying nothing that's not true.\"\n \n Clark interrupted Louchart and reminded him that prosecutors could use anything he said against him.\n \n Clark also arraigned Wayne F. Parcham, 20, of 613 Cleveland on charges of receiving or concealing three of the stolen firearms. The judge set a $375,000 bond for Parcham.\n The three suspects will have a Wednesday, March 5, preliminary examination before Clark.\n \n Prosecutors charged Louchart and McClure with continuing a criminal enterprise, receiving or concealing stolen firearms, possessing burglar's tools and three counts of possessing a firearm while committing a felony.\n \n Louchart faces an additional charge of possessing a firearm as a felon.\n \n The fourth person arrested, Matthew J. Soule, 32, of St. Charles Township has not faced arraignment yet.\nSounds like a pretty lousy security system at ye ole' gun shop. Somebody outght to make a law.",

   "The Hidden Agenda Behind Gun Storage Laws By David Kopel\n In Canada and Great Britain deceitful \"safe storage\" laws allow government invasion of gun owners` homes. \n These laws are all part of the gun grabbers` wholesale attack on private gun ownership.\n Responsible gun owners store their guns safely. For over a century, the National Rifle Association and other civic groups have done everything they can to encourage safe gun storage.\n \n Partly as a result, the fatal gun accident rate for both kids and adults has fallen to an all-time low. In spite of this, anti-gun politicians, and the anti-gun groups are working to turn \"safe storage\" into a tool for disarming the American public.\n Gun owners who think they have nothing to lose from a government takeover of gun storage should look at what has happened in countries such as Canada and Great Britain. There, gun owner apathy has allowed \"safe storage\" to become the platform for abolishing gun ownership for home protection, for invading the privacy and the homes of gun owners, and for attacking even the simple possession of firearms.\n \n Great Britain\n British gun owners have a long tradition of going along with government proposals for \"reasonable\" restrictions on their rights. But as many Britons found out too late, a restriction that appears reasonable on paper may become quite unreasonable in practice.\n \n British law merely mandates that guns be stored in \"a secure place.\" But Britain has a national gun licensing system, similar to the American system proposed by Sarah Brady of Handgun Control, Inc. Because most police administrators in Britain are intensely opposed to citizens owning guns, they use the storage law to make acquiring a gun license as onerous as possible.\n \n \n If you want to obtain or renew a gun license in Britain, two police officers will visit your home to scrutinize your gun security system. Although the law, even today, does not order guns to be locked in a safe, the police routinely compel gun owners to purchase safes--sometimes two safes, the second one for separate storage of ammunition. A person buying a low-powered L5 rimfire rifle may have to spend \u00a3100 on a safe. A person with five guns may be ordered to add a \u00a31000 electronic security system.\n \n \n One effect of the heavy security costs is to reduce the ability of middle-income or poor people to legally own guns, a goal which has been a constant objective of gun control proponents throughout history. Of course, the requirement that guns be locked in safes makes it nearly impossible for the gun to be used for home protection and the British police establishment despises the idea of defensive gun ownership.\n \n \n If you want to obtain or renew a gun license in Britain, two police officers will visit your home to scrutinize your gun security system. \n \n \n The requirement that gun owners purchase safes was never democratically enacted by the British Parliament. Rather, the requirement was invented by police administrators, who correctly recognized that any system requiring government permission to buy a gun can be manipulated by anti-gun administrators. (Similarly, in the United States, police administrators have used the Brady Act to deny handgun purchases by thousands of people with unpaid traffic tickets or other trivial offenses. Brady does not formally sanction such abuses, but by requiring government permission for handgun purchases, the Act makes such abuses inevitable.)\n \n Canada\n In Canada, the Criminal Code prohibits \"careless\" storage of a firearm, and gives the government the authority to create storage regulations. What does this mean in practice? Consider some cases from 1996 and 1997:\n \n Hearing suspicious sounds, perhaps from a burglar, a husband took his unloaded rifle with him one night when he looked around his house. A few days later, the wife told a friend about the incident. Aghast, the friend called the police.\n \n The police arrived at the couple`s home and bullied their way in. Searching the home, they found the unloaded rifle under a mattress in the bedroom. No children lived in the home. The couple was charged with careless storage of a firearm.\n \n A 67-year-old single woman ran a small boarding house in Ontario. A downstairs tenant began harassing and stalking her. Worried that the woman might pose a threat to the tenant, the police searched her apartment and found several unloaded guns in her closets. She was convicted of storage of a firearm in violation of government regulations. She had been attending school and studying to become a paralegal, but her conviction will bar her from a job in the legal field.\n \n Recently in Winnipeg, a 72-year-old woman called a hospital to request that a visiting nurse come over and help her with some medication. Someone from the hospital asked if the woman had any firearms in the home. \"Yes,\" she replied, \"my husband has a couple of old hunting rifles down in the rec room.\"\n \n The police came over immediately and began searching the home. They found several long guns, each with a trigger lock and locked to a rack in the basement. They also found a .25 caliber pistol locked in a bedroom closet, which they had broken into.\n \n The 73-year-old husband came home in the middle of the search, and was immediately handcuffed, and accused of being violent. Other than the fact that he owned guns, there was no evidence that he was violent. (His neighbors later signed statements saying they had known him for years, and he had always been peaceful.) Eventually the police removed the handcuffs, and told the man that he had never been under arrest. \n \n Gun storage laws sometimes provide a means for police to justify outrageously bad police work. In Medicine Hat, Alberta, a criminal who had charges pending against him tried to buy leniency by claiming that a man named Larry Davies was a marijuana dealer, with over a pound in his house. The Medicine Hat police did nothing to verify the informant`s claim, other than looking up Larry Davies` address in the phone book.\n \n The SWAT team, apparently having nothing else to do that day, broke into the Davies household, and forced Larry Davies and three friends to the floor, pointing submachine guns at their heads. A search of the house revealed: Mrs. Davies and her newborn baby, who had come home from the hospital that day; four grams of marijuana (weighing less than a United States 25-cent piece); and a disassembled FN/FAL rifle in a basement closet.\n \n Apparently embarrassed but not repentant about the sloppy police practices and wanton show of force, the government charged Mr. Davies with unsafe storage of a firearm. Happily, a judge threw the charges out of court, noting that whatever Mr. Davies had done was much less of a threat to society than what the police had done.\n \n And Canadian courts have sometimes stopped other abusive prosecutions related to gun storage laws. But even then, the victim of the abusive prosecution must spend thousands of dollars in legal fees to avoid a prison sentence of up to two years.\n \n As David Tomlinson, President of Canada`s National Firearms Association, points out, gun storage laws are unenforceable without random police searches of the home. Canada`s newest gun law, which goes into effect next year, gives the police the authority to \"inspect\" private homes to ensure that gun storage laws are being complied with.\n \n Gun storage laws are like laws barring married couples from using birth control: they are unenforceable without massive government intrusions into the sanctity of the home. In 1965, the United States Supreme Court struck down a birth control ban for this very reason. (Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965)). For the same reason, privacy-minded legislators and citizens should reject turning the government into the home gun storage enforcer.\n \n \n Former-President Clinton, by the way, effusively praised the new Canadian gun law (Bill C-68) which authorizes searches without probable cause.\n \n \n SMALL STEPS\n Gun prohibition almost always moves by incremental steps. Restrictions that would have seemed outrageous if proposed by themselves can appear \"reasonable\" when they merely advance existing restrictions a few more steps.\n \n Gun storage laws are. . . unenforceable without massive government intrusions into the sanctity of the home. \n \n In Canada, prohibitionists, such as then-Justice Minister Alan Rock, have used gun storage laws as a justification for imposing universal gun registration, since registration \"will create a sense of accountability on the part of the firearms owner to comply with some of the safe storage laws that are in effect.\"\n \n As the next step, the anti-gun lobbies in Canada have begun pushing for \"community storage.\" Rather than keeping your guns in a safe in your home, you would have to keep your guns at a police station. When you wanted to use your gun for the day, you could check it out from the police station.\n The anti-gun groups point out that a gun in the home could be stolen, or could be misused in a domestic incident. There is no reason, they argue, for guns to be kept in a home 365 days a year, when the gun may only be used a few days a year.\n \n To counter the anti-gun groups, gun owners in Canada can hardly argue that removing guns from the home makes it impossible to use the guns for home defense. They gave up the moral case for self-defense years ago by arguing that gun ownership was justified for sporting purposes, but not daring to assert that gun ownership is justified for defensive purposes. And by agreeing to \"safe storage\" laws, the Canadian gun owners gave up the practical ability to use a gun for self-defense in a sudden emergency.\n \n With so much ground already conceded, Canadian gun owners are reduced to arguing minor points, such as how a centralized gun storage repository might be more vulnerable to theft.\n \n Even conceding on the \"community storage\" issue will do gun owners no good. In 1996, the British Parliament banned almost all handguns, but allowed owners of single-shot .22s to keep the guns locked in central repositories at gun ranges. The new restrictions only briefly sated the appetite of the British anti-gun lobbies. In 1997, community storage was replaced by its logical consequence, complete prohibition of all handguns.\n \n The Future\n Who can believe that the right to keep and bear arms could survive \"community storage,\" with gun owners needing to ask government bureaucrats for permission to obtain access to their own guns? Who can believe that the American anti-gun lobbies, who so consistently imitate the programs of their foreign cousins, will not begin demanding community storage, once they have laid the foundation with \"safe storage\" laws?\n \n Storing guns safely is the duty of every gun owner. What makes for safety depends very much on individual circumstances. Safety is, and always has been, the concern of organizations such as the National Rifle Association. In the hands of anti-gun lobbies and government bureaucrats, though, \"safe storage\" becomes an Orwellian term designed to negate the many safety benefits of the right to bear arms. Home safety is the responsibility of the family, not the state.\n \n Sources: Some material herein is from Dave Kopel`s award-winning book The Samurai, the Mountie, and the Cowboy: Should America Adopt the Gun Control Policies of Other Democracies?

   "\"This paper reports on the first State-by-State analysis of firearm theft and crime, with the intention of alerting policymakers, law enforcement, gun stores, firearms manufacturers, and families to the facts that gun theft is common and preventable and has serious consequences.\"\n \n This is some thing that is not known perhaps? Otherwise its an exercise in puffery.\n \n The study found that 1.7 million firearms were stolen from homes and elsewhere over the period between January 1993 and August 2002, and these thefts varied widely from State to State. \n \n Did we note the else where and no distinction between homes and there?\n \n The States of Alaska, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, New Mexico, and Georgia had firearm theft rates greater than twice the national average. \n \n The real question is firearm density. Was it greater or lesser in these states? Failure to prove cause and effect big time.\n \n Firearm theft rates were dramatically lower in States with safe storage laws. \n \n Of course the methodology is left out of the abstract, why? Is it flawed like that of Martin Killias?\n \n Licensed gun stores were also targets of theft. \n \n Oh a quantity of firearms there no suprise.\n \n The stolen guns have fueled the black market in crime guns. Although Federal law has targeted gun thefts, violations of this law are rarely prosecuted. \n \n So a fault in the criminal justice system is supposed to make us all liable? Why aren't they prosecuted?\n \n The Americans for Gun Safety Foundation will soon launch a public-education campaign through licensed firearms dealers to encourage gun owners to properly store firearms to prevent theft. \n \n Oh joy a gun grabber group is going to lecture us. \n \n Pawnshops and licensed gun dealers should first be permitted, and then required, to check all used firearms they purchase through the FBI's Stolen Gun File Registry to determine whether the guns they are purchasing are stolen. \n \n Seems to me this should already be in place. \n \n U.S. attorneys should aggressively enforce Federal gun laws and investigate and prosecute stolen firearms cases. \n \n Why aren't they already? See above for rarely prosecuted. No new laws needed here.\n \n Also, gun-lock manufacturers should develop safety locks that cannot easily be defeated by a criminal, such that a stolen gun with a proper lock cannot be used. \n \n Gee are you going to persecute them if they fail?\n \n High-quality gun locks, or an alternative storage device, should be sold as a requirement of each firearm sale. \n \n Isn't that part of the Brady bill? Here in this state they include it whether you want it or not.\n \n Finally, States and the Federal Government should consider passing safe-storage laws as a means to reduce firearm theft. \n \n So far you have laws against theft that aren't being prosecuted. Thefts from law enforcement that go unpunished. Yet this gun grabber group of drooling nit wits wants more laws that attack the law abiding. Seems to me if you get caught with a stolen firearm if they cut off your hands and harvest your eyes that would be more of a deterrent. \n\n \n I'm disappointed ole slimjim didn't try to defend his pet article but then some things are indefensible.",

   "Not-so Safe-Storage Laws\n The only ones \"safe\" are the intruders.\n By Dave Kopel, Dr. Paul Gallant & Dr. Joanne Eisen \n of the Independence Institute \n \n e're told that \"safe-storage\" laws for guns are all about saving the lives of our children. In fact, these laws lead directly to the deaths of both children and adults. The only people to end up safer are violent home intruders. \n \n In a chapter in a book published last month, The Crime Drop in America (Cambridge Univ. Press), Dr. Garen Wintemute - one of the intellectual stars of the anti-gun movement - commented on \"access to firearms\" in America. \n \n According to a 1996 Department of Justice survey, 35 to 40 percent of American households have firearms in them. (The true figure may be closer to 1 out of 2 households, since some gun owners may be reluctant to disclose private information to pollsters.).... remarkably, one-third of handguns in the United States - perhaps 20 million guns - were stored loaded and not locked away.\" \n Loaded guns just lying around the homes of Americans, ready for action. A clear and present danger to the families in those households? Not according to current safety figures. \n \n In 1994, fatal gun accidents reached the lowest annual level since record-keeping began in 1903. They've dropped even lower each year since. \n \n What should have been \"remarkable\" to Wintemute is that there were just 20 fatal gun accidents among children under the age of 5 in 1998. Contrast this with phony claims you hear about \"10 children a day killed by guns.\" The greatest part of that factoid comes from gang-related homicides perpetrated by inner-city, 17-to-19-year-old male criminals. \n \n Also contrast the 20 fatal gun accidents for children 0-to-4 with the near 600 children in that same age group who drowned. In fact, more children under the age of 5 drown in 5-gallon buckets of water than are harmed in a firearm accident. \n \n You'd never know this by reading the current fundraising letter from Handgun Control, Inc. (HCI), which shrieks about parents leaving loaded guns on the dining room table within reach of small children. The letter doesn't point to any actual instances of such dining-room tragedy. Rather it complains that most states don't have a law specifically forbidding it. \n \n In truth, all states have reckless endangerment and negligence laws which apply to guns, drain cleaner, knives, vodka, or anything else that might cause injury in the hands of a small child. Even without an HCI-mandated gun-lock law, parents know plenty of ways to keep items away from children without using mechanical locks. \n \n We are told that \"reasonable\" trigger-lock laws are the cure for firearm accidents and gun thefts. What we are not told is that trigger-locks won't stop 10-year-olds, who can pop them off with screwdrivers, or break them with hammers. Such locks certainly won't stop determined criminals. So just who is the target of these \"reasonable\" gun laws, and what's their real purpose? \n \n Rather than saving lives, could it be that trigger-lock laws are intended to condition Americans into believing that firearms aren't acceptable for self-defense, or worth the bother? \n \n Safe and Sorry\n The most up-to-date research on the effect of gun-storage laws comes from Dr. John Lott and Dr. John Whitley in a study scheduled for publication in the April 2001 issue of the Journal of Law and Economics. In \"Safe Storage Gun Laws: Accidental Deaths, Suicides, and Crime\", Lott and Whitley analyzed the effects of safe storage laws from data spanning nearly 20 years. Their preliminary findings were released on March 29, 2000. \n \n Lott and Whitley found that not only did such laws not save lives, they cost lives by making it more difficult to have a firearm ready for a sudden emergency. During the first 5 years after the passage of \"safe-storage\" laws, the group of 15 states that adopted them saw average annual increases of murders (over 300), rapes (3,860), robberies (24,650), and aggravated assaults (over 25,000). \n \n The significant danger of gun-storage laws was brought home in an August incident in Merced, California, where a pitchfork-wielding man attacked Jessica Carpenter's 7-year-old brother and 9-year-old sister. It's neither a surprise nor a coincidence that the cause of this tragedy went unreported by the national press. \n \n Jessica's father had kept a gun in the home, and his children had learned how to fire it. Jessica, age 14, is a very good shot. But by California law, the gun had to be locked up when the parents weren't home. So, when the murderer attacked, Jessica wasn't able to retrieve the gun to save her siblings. She ran to a neighbor, and begged for help. By the time the police showed up, the 7-year-old boy and the 9-year-old girl had been stabbed to death with the pitchfork. \n \n In the aftermath, the children's great-uncle, Rev. John Hilton, declared that their father was \"more afraid of the law than of somebody coming in for his family. He's scared to death of leaving the gun where kids could get it because he's afraid of the law. He's scared to teach his children to defend themselves.\" \n \n According to Section 12035 of California's Dangerous Weapons Control Law, \"criminal storage of a firearm in the first degree\" is punishable by confinement to state prison for a maximum of 3 years, and/or a fine of up to $10,000. \n \n But it was compliance with California's \"safe-storage\" laws - and the fear of being prosecuted for their violation - that cost the Carpenter family two of their children. \n \n Lobbying with Lives\n When it comes to \"safe-storage,\" the real tragedy is that, despite all the professed concerns about \"the children,\" the anti-self-defense lobby has no qualms in playing politics with the lives of children. Wintemute, who has a much stronger record for intellectual honesty than many other researchers on his side of the gun issue, admits that for \"child-access prevention laws...at this time there is no good evidence that the laws are effective.\" \n \n Indeed, there is direct evidence that these are lethal laws. The tragedy in Merced is just one graphic instance of the thousands of additional murders and violent crimes that have resulted from criminals being emboldened by gun-storage laws that turn a family's home into a safe zone for violent predators. \n \n The hidden agenda behind safe-storage laws has nothing to do with safety. First, the anti-gun lobby believes that armed self-defense, by people who are not government employees, is inherently immoral; so preventing families from protecting themselves is a step forward for civilization. The late David Clarke was the leading anti-gun advocate on the Washington, D.C. City Council. He claimed that his efforts to outlaw gun ownership for self-defense \"are designed to move this government toward civilization...I don't intend to run the government around the moment of survival.\" \n \n Mrs. Sarah Brady, Chair of Handgun Control, Inc., agrees: \"To me, the only reason for guns in civilian hands is for sporting purposes.\" As a direct result of her group's successful lobbying, the California government was emphatically not around at \"the moment of survival\" for the Carpenter children. \n \n In Canada, gun prohibitionists, such as then-Justice Minister Alan Rock, have used storage laws as a justification for imposing universal gun registration, since registration \"will create a sense of accountability on the part of the firearms owner to comply with some of the safe-storage laws that are in effect.\" \n \n As the next step, the anti-gun lobbies in Canada (who work closely with their American cousins) have begun pushing for \"community storage.\" Rather than keeping your guns in a safe in your home, you would have to keep your guns at a police station. When you wanted to use your gun for the day, you could check it out from the police station. \n \n This latest Canadian ploy isn't really new. Long ago, Sir Walter Raleigh wrote that the \"sophisticated and subtle tyrant\" will \"unarm his people, and store up their weapons, under pretence of keeping them safe.\" \n \n In the 1950s, one of the most popular sitcoms was Father Knows Best. Starring Robert Young as head of the Anderson family, it centered on family values and personal responsibility. The show was not entitled Government Knows Best. Half a century later, it's still true that parents, not legislators, know best how to keep their children safe. \n \n Because the vocabulary of the debate has a great influence on the debate's result, people who really care about family safety need to stop using the words \"safe storage\" when discussing lethal laws like government-storage mandates. These laws turn a family's home into a safe zone for criminals. \n <cue muhahahaha< the suspense is killing almost as much as the safe storage scam",

   "When gun laws cost children's lives \n The risk of gun control laws. (I have written on this before, but it is nice to see the story updated.)\n \n \n Jessica Lynne Carpenter was 14 years old on Aug. 23, 2000, the morning 27-year-old Jonathan David Bruce came calling at the Carpenter house in Merced, Calif.\n \n Jessica Lynne knew how to shoot -- her father had taught her. And there were adequate firearms in the house to deal with what happened next.\n Advertisement\n Click here for Best Buy!\n \n That Wednesday morning, Jessica was home with four of her siblings -- Anna, 13; Vanessa, 11; Ashley, 9; and John William, 7 -- in the San Joaquin Valley farming community, 130 miles southeast of San Francisco.\n \n Bruce, an out-of-work telemarketer apparently high on drugs, was stark naked and armed with a spade fork. He cut the phone lines to the house shortly after 9 a.m., broke in, and immediately began chasing down and stabbing the children in their bedrooms.\n \n Jessica Lynne tried to dial 911. The phone was dead. So she ran to the gun closet.\n \n Then she remembered the new \"safe storage law\" that had just been enacted in California, and which her parents had told her about. When John and Tephanie Carpenter had left the house that morning, they had locked the gun closet so no one under 18 could get access to the family firearms ... as required by law.\n \n Jessica's only option was to climb out a window and run to a neighbor's house.\n \n By the time Merced County sheriff's deputies arrived at the home, John William and Ashley were dead. Anna was wounded but survived.\n \n As deputies arrived, Bruce rushed them with his bloody spade fork. So they shot him dead. They shot him more than a dozen times.\n \n The following Friday, the children's great uncle, the Rev. John Hilton, told reporters: \"If only (Jessica) had a gun available to her, she could have stopped the whole thing.\" Maybe John William and Ashley would still be alive, Jessica's uncle said.\n \n \"Unfortunately, 17 states now have these so-called safe storage laws,\" then-Yale Law School senior research scholar John Lott, author of the book \"More Guns, Less Crime,\" told me at the time. \"The problem is, you see no decline in either juvenile accidental gun deaths or suicides when such laws are enacted, but you do see an increase in crime rates\" perpetrated against the newly disarmed victims. . . .\n posted by John Lott at 11:22 AM",

   "http://johnrlott.tripod.com/whitney.pdf\n \n Anti-Gun Lobby's Lies of Omission\n by Ari Armstrong, February 15, 2000 \n \n Apparently anti-gun activists aren't Star Trek fans. On a recent rerun of The Next Generation, Captain Picard tells a young cadet, \"A lie of omission is still a lie.\" This basic moral lesson has escaped some Colorado gun foes.\n \n John Head, a founder of Sane Alternatives to the Firearms Epidemic, the name of which likens gun ownership to a disease, published an article in the February 13 Rocky Mountain News in which he argues mandatory gun storage laws will make people safer. But the \"evidence\" he uses consistently misrepresents the full facts. Moreover, many of Head's claims were shown to be misleading years ago by scholars such as David Kopel and Gary Kleck. That Head would continue to repeat such lies of omission, despite their apparent absurdity, can only be chalked up to his intellectual dishonesty. \n \n For instance, Head writes, \"But guns kept in the home for self-protection are more likely to kill somebody the shooter knows than to kill in self-defense -- 22 times more likely, according to the New England Journal of Medicine.\" (Head makes this same point several times, I suppose for effect.)\n \n The most significant of Head's omissions is the vast number of times guns are used in the home for self-defense without resulting in death or injury. As John Lott put it in a \"counterpoint\" article also published in the News, \"Guns clearly deter criminals, with Americans using guns defensively more than 2 million times each year -- five times more frequently than the 430,000 times guns were used to commit crimes in 1997. Some 98 percent of the time, simply brandishing a weapon is sufficient to stop the attack.\" [2/26/03 Update: Lott's 98% figure is unreliable -- see Freedom Updates: February 26, 2003. However, it remains the case that most defensive uses of a gun involve brandishment.] Clearly, a person is much safer keeping a gun at home for self-defense than failing to do so. In addition, some criminals never even attempt violence out of fear of gun owners.\n \n Certainly Head's statistics have no bearing whatsoever on his suggestion that mandatory locks would not make self-defense against criminals more difficult (or often impossible), as critics argue. He says the argument that mandatory locks will empower criminals is rooted in \"fear,\" yet he never gives any argument relevant to that point. Because mandatory locks would have the effect of impairing self-defense, some \"fear\" of such laws is warranted.\n \n But Head's irresponsible statistics contain even more \"damn lies.\" Head reifies firearms, enabling him to ignore human culpability. He writes, \"guns... are more likely to kill...\" (Emphasis added.) But guns aren't likely to do anything whatsoever, any more than cars are likely to drive or hammers are likely to strike. Unfortunately, domestic violence is a cause of much of the crime to which Head refers, and this problem cannot be attributed to gun ownership.\n \n The rest of the truth is that gun accidents resulted in the deaths of 1,225 people in the United States in 1995. Fires resulted in 3,761 deaths, drowning in 4,350 deaths, poisoning in 8,461 deaths, and falls in 13,986 deaths (National Safety Council Accident Facts). While firearm safety remains an important issue, most gun owners are remarkably safe with their arms.\n \n To compare gun accidents with homicides and suicides, in 1995 there were 1,125 accidents, 15,551 homicides, and 18,503 suicides. How do this basic numbers fit with Head's comment? He writes:\n \n Because handguns and other firearms are so easily accessible to many children, adolescents and others in their homes, the risk of gun violence in the home increases dramatically. The risk of homicide in the home is three times greater in households with guns and the risk of suicide is five times greater. A gun in the home greatly increases the likelihood of an unintentional shooting, particularly among children.\n This is a slam-dunk on a court of smoke and mirrors. One point Head omits is that both the rate of gun homicides and the rate of gun accidents are low, relative to the number of gun owners. (Actually, Head inadvertently admits this point in another part of his essay, where he says, \"There are more than 200 million guns in America -- almost one gun for every man, woman, and child.\" But he doesn't notice how this point impacts his other comments.)\n \n On one point, Head states the obvious: gun accidents and gun homicides are unlikely if there's no gun around. However, defensive uses of guns are also unlikely if there's no gun around, but this type of cost-benefit analysis doesn't lend itself to Head's politicized propaganda. As Lott writes, \"During the five years from 1992 to 1996, there were two accidental gun deaths involving a child under the age of 10 [in Colorado]... less than one percent of all accidental deaths for this age group.\" By Head's reasoning, an increase from zero to two is a \"dramatic increase\" -- indeed, an increase of an infinite percent!\n \n The mandatory storage laws Head advocates would not eliminate the gun accidents and homicides he discusses. Note how Head conflates \"children, adolescents and others\" in his statistics. That's just an emotion-laden way of saying \"everybody.\" In cases of domestic violence, a mandatory lock is not likely to stop the violence (nor is the absence of a gun).\n \n What about Head's claim that \"the risk of homicide in the home is three times greater in households with guns?\" This is the conclusion of a study conducted in part by anti-gun fanatic Dr. Arthur Kellermann. Kellermann and his fellow researchers made several methodological errors in their study. They relied on survey data, for which many people don't admit to owning a gun. So the number of households with guns is understated.\n \n Nor did the researchers take into account the fact that the guns owned in the home were not necessarily the instruments used to commit the homicide. This is significant for at least a couple reasons. First, people often buy a gun for self-defense if they are being threatened by violence; say, if a woman is being threatened by her violent ex-husband. Even though the woman is better-protected with a gun than without one, she still faces an increased risk of victimization. Second, gangsters who operate on the black-market dealing drugs generally own guns (illegally) and are also at a higher risk of violence. It's important to note that the study was conducted only for select high-population areas.\n \n In short, no evidence offered by Head suggests that a normal person who owns a gun is at any greater risk of homicide than anyone else. When we factor in the usefulness of guns for self-defense against violent criminals, it's clear that normal gun owners are at less risk of criminal victimization.\n \n Head also claims that \"risk of suicide is five times greater\" in homes with guns. This is utter nonsense. When evaluating this point, remember that the rate of suicide is very low among the population as a whole. When committing suicide, true, some use a gun. Indeed, some purchase a gun with the intent to kill themselves with it. It's not the case, as Head seems to suggest, that the presence of a gun in a normal household somehow casts off evil waves that make the occupants go crazy and kill themselves. As researchers such as Gary Kleck (Targeting Guns) and David Kopel (The Samurai, the Mountie, and the Cowboy) have found, suicides will generally find some other way to kill themselves if a gun is not available. For instance, the suicide rate is twice as high in Japan even though guns are less widely available. And, again, the usefulness of guns for normal households in self-defense against violent criminals must also be kept in mind.\n \n Head also writes, \"A gun is used for protection in fewer than 2 percent of home invasion crimes.\" Of course, this includes home invasions which take place when the occupants are not home. Indeed, as Gary Kleck found, the presence of guns in households tends to cause criminals to break into homes when the occupants are not at home, so as to avoid getting shot. When we look at home invasions for which the occupants are home, a gun used in self-defense makes the occupants much safer than they would be otherwise.\n \n According to Head, \"From 1997-99, in the 12 states where safe storage laws were in effect at the beginning of the study period, accidental deaths of children alone decreased 23 percent.\" But this study didn't take into account any other possible factors that might also explain the decrease. For instance, Florida alone is responsible for most of the decrease, but the Eddie Eagle firearm safety progam for youth also caught on big in Florida schools during that period. Lott's research comparing states with various laws finds that mandatory strorage laws do not decrease accidents. Regardless, mandatory locks do increase the chances of criminal victimization.\n \n Head's article is but one example of the intellectually dishonest means disarmament activists employ to advance their political agenda. Many such activists use pseudo-scientific statistics carefully massaged to disguise the full truth. At other times, disarmament activists merely resort to ad hominem attacks, character assassinations, and flagrantly emotionalized appeals. If we're looking for analysis on \"reasonable\" gun laws, documents from Head and his group are the last place to look.\n \n The Colorado Freedom Report--www.FreeColorado.com",

   "Safe Storage Gun Laws: Accidental Deaths, Suicides, and Crime \n \n John R. Lott Jr.\n University of Maryland Foundation, University of Maryland\n \n John E. Whitley \n University of Adelaide - School of Economics\n \n \n March 29, 2000\n \n Yale Law School, Law & Economics Working Paper No. 237 \n \n \n Abstract: \n It is frequently assumed that safe storage gun laws reduce accidental gun deaths and total suicides, while the possible impact on crime rates are ignored. However, given existing work on the adverse impact of other safety laws, such as safety caps for storing medicine, even the very plausible assumption of reduced accidental gun deaths cannot be taken for granted. Our paper analyzes both state and county data spanning nearly twenty years, and we find no support that safe storage laws reduce either juvenile accidental gun deaths or suicides. Instead, these storage requirements appear to impair people?s ability to use guns defensively. Because accidental shooters also tend to be the ones most likely to violate the new law, safe storage laws increase violent and property crimes against low risk citizens with no observable offsetting benefit in terms of reduced accidents or suicides. During the first five full years after the passage of the safe storage laws, the group of fifteen states that adopted these laws faced an annual average increase of over 300 more murders, 3,860 more rapes, 24,650 more robberies, and over 25,000 more aggravated assaults. On average, the annual costs borne by victims averaged over $2.6 billion as a result of lost productivity, out-of-pocket expenses, medical bills, and property losses.",

Doesn't prevent any crime or it would be touted in the left-tard media endlessly. It targets law abiding gun owners rather than the criminal element. That fact alone should set off alarm bells in the most dim witted amongst us. The methodology used in trying to show it is a problem is suspect as it isn't even shown. There is no study or stats to show it even slows down the criminal element. It has been shown that even the ATF believes straw purchasers rather than law abiding civilians are the problem in gun trafficing. Proponents admit that enforcement is seldom done. It has been shown that gun locks and safe storage at the very least hinder self defense. In the case of DC and certain other areas it amounts to a total gun ban. It has been shown that a real danger of search and seizure exists in further laws that include include home inspections to ensure compliance. One need only look at new Orleans to see what happened there. How many of those illegally seized fireams made it back to their rightfull owners? \n \n So I'll pass on the scam thanks.

We also provide an illustration of how our jurisdiction-specific regression model has the capacity to generate more nuanced assessments concerning which states might profit from or be harmed by a particular legal intervention.\" \n SSRN-Shooting Down the More Guns, Less Crime Hypothesis by Ian Ayres, John Donohue\n\n \n Neat wording, they admit that it reduced violent crime, like murder, rape, assault etc. but somehow cause a rise in OTHER crime.

He had a flintlock rifle custom made and shipped to him, but the police are currently putting pressure on him to register the gun. New York law requires all modern weaponry to be registered, however there's an exception that says antique weaponry, genuine or reproduction, doesn't have to be registered. Nobody has any authority to make Littlejohn comply with the demands that he actually register his flintlock rifle, but they're still demanding that he do it even though there's no legal standing for it.\n \n Why is New York trying to force this man to do something that he's not required to by law, and they have no legal authority to punish him if he refuses to comply?\n \n And before anybody asks about what relevance this has, I'm gonna tell you. Even if you're complying with the law, the police/court will try and prosecute you for some violation no matter how trivial, even if you did nothing wrong, and they'll do this because they can make money off of it. Every year thousands of innocent people are brought to trial and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars just to clear their name. Mr. Carpenter could've claimed that the exceptions protected him, but he still would've risked being jailed and brought to trial.\n \n Isn't that what you said, Sinjin; innocent or guilty, tell it to a judge and let him sort it out?

   "More from Ayres and Donohue:\n \n \"Abstract: In their reply to our comment on their initial paper, Moody and Marvell continue their analysis of right-to-carry (RTC) laws using panel data for the period 1977-2000. But with six additional years of data now available for analysis, we think the need for further parsing of older data is of limited value in assessing the more guns, less crime hypothesis. In this comment, we add six years of data to what Moody and Marvell previously analyzed. We show that, whether one looks at the original Lott and Mustard specification, the latest Moody and Marvell specification, or a plausible alternative specification, there is consistent evidence for the unsurprising proposition that RTC laws increase aggravated assault. We address some anomalies in these models and their resulting estimates. The Lott and Mustard model, for example, suffers from omitted-variable bias in failing to control for the impact of incarceration. In addition, the Moody and Marvell model generates odd predictions of the impact of incarceration on crime for most crime categories, and it appears to suggest (anomalously) that crack had no impact on murder. These and other problems raise questions about how well these regressions work to reveal the true effect on crime of RTC laws. For instance, would better data and models reveal that the estimated increases in murder and robbery are also statistically significant, as they are for the related violent crime of aggravated assault? Or might the estimated effect of aggravated assault be altered if we knew the full impact of changing police responses to domestic violence?\" \n EconPapers: More Guns, Less Crime Fails Again: The Latest Evidence from 1922-2006\n \n aggravated assault n. the crime of physically attacking another person which results in serious bodily harm and/or is made with a deadly or dangerous weapon such as a gun, knife, sword, ax or blunt instrument.\n \n I don't find it surprising at all that more people carrying deadly weapons around would lead to more assaults with deadly weapons.",

Between 1977 and 1995157, the average death rate from mass shootings plummeted by up to 91% after such laws went into effect, and injuries dropped by over 80%.158153Some criminologist believe measuring first year change is shortsighted as it takes more than a year for permits tobe issued, reach critical quantities, and for the criminally minded to recognize the new situation and avoid violent confrontations.154Bureau of Justice Statistics, online database, reviewing Texas and U.S. violent crime from 1995-2001. 155John Lott, David Mustard: This study involved county level crime statistics from all 3,054 counties in the U.S., from 1977 through 1992. During this time ten states adopted right-to-carry laws. It is estimated that if all states had adopted right-to-carry laws, in 1992 the US would have avoided 1,400 murders, 4,200 rapes, 12,000 robberies, 60,000 aggravated assaults - and saved over $5,000,000,000 in victim expenses. 156FBI, Uniform Crime Reports, 2004 - excludes Hawaii and Rhode Island - small populations and geographic isolation create other determinants to violent crime. 157Federal legislation created a nation \"gun-free schools\" policy, effective in 1996. Some criminologists maintainthis created a new dynamic, encouraging mass murder on campus. Thus after 1995 it is increasing difficult to makecomparisons based on the effects of CCWs and mass shootings. 158\"Multiple Victim Public Shootings, Bombings, and Right-to-Carry Concealed Handgun Laws: ContrastingPrivate and Public Law Enforcement\", John Lott and William Landes, Law School of the University of Chicago,Law & Economics Working Paper No. 73 Type of Crime % Higher in Restrictive States Robbery 105% Murder 86% Assault 82% Violent Crime 81% Auto theft 60% Rape 25% \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Page 3 \n Gun Facts Version 5.0Page 25 Copyright 2008, Guy Smith www.GunFacts.infoAll Rights ReservedMyth: People with concealed weapons permits will commit crimes Fact: The results for the first 30 states that passed \"shall-issue\" laws for concealed carry permits are similar.

   "I see the starstruck one has slithered in to obfuscate the issue with drivel as usual. The word Lott must trigger a conditioned reflex amongst the shill of the Brady bunch.\n \n \"Opinion Editorial\n \n By Ari Armstrong\n \n Ken Gordon's Senate bill 160 claims to be about \"safe storage of firearms.\" In reality it will not save lives, but will instead empower criminals by discouraging responsible self-defense.\n \n Mandatory gun storage laws have already been tried in other states. They have failed miserably. In his comprehensive study More Guns, Less Crime (2d edition), Yale scholar John Lott finds \"no support for the theory that safe-storage laws reduce either juvenile accidental gun deaths or suicides. Instead, these storage requirements appear to impair people's ability to use guns defensively.\" Indeed, during the five years following the passage of such in laws in 15 states, and taking into account preexisting trends, Lott finds the laws resulted in 300 additional murders; 3,860 more rapes; 24,650 more robberies; and 25,000 more assaults.\n \n One legislator calls mandatory storage laws the \"Rapist Protection Act,\" a view supported by the evidence. \n \n Gordon's bill is not as onerous as those found in some states. Whereas some laws absolutely require a gun to be rendered useless for self-defense, Gordon's proposal requires criminal penalties if a juvenile gains access to a gun. Yet the sole result of the bill would be to empower criminals and endanger Coloradans.\n \n The language of the proposal is vague and will be used to harass honest gun owners. It says \"'negligently store' means to place or leave a firearm in a location where a reasonable person would find a substantial and unjustifiable risk exists that a juvenile would obtain possession of such firearm.\" Unfortunately, laws aren't enforced by a \"reasonable person,\" they are enforced by politically motivated prosecutors and by \"juries\" which are hand-picked to exclude people who might sympathize with a defendant. \n \n The law makes no exception for theft. Even if a gun owner keeps a gun behind two locked doors, he or she is still at risk of prosecution if the gun is stolen. The bill would have a chilling effect on the right of self-defense.\n \n Gordon completely ignores the benefits of firearms for self-defense. No doubt Mike Feeley's Democrats will send out misleading flyers in the next elections accusing the Second Amendment supporters of putting guns in the hands of unsupervised children.\n \n The truth is that child endangerment is already against the law. Colorado Statute 18-6-401(1)(a) states, \"A person commits child abuse if such person causes an injury to a child's life or health, or permits a child to be unreasonably placed in a situation that poses a threat of injury to the child's life or health, or engages in a continued pattern of conduct that results in malnourishment, lack of proper medical care, cruel punishment, mistreatment, or an accumulation of injuries that ultimately results in the death of a child or serious bodily injury to a child.\" In addition, irresponsible persons are subject to civil liability.\n \n In other words, the law already takes care of the problem Gordon claims to address. The difference is that existing law doesn't discriminate against one class of citizens. In 1996 for the nation, 138 children ages 0-14 died of unintentional gunfire. The same year, 211 children died of choking, 761 of burns, 981 of drowning, and 3,015 of car crashes (National Safety Council). So why isn't Gordon drafting specific \"safe storage\" language for matches, buckets, swimming pools, cars, and throat-sized objects?\n \n Those 138 deaths are tragic, and of course we all want to help prevent them. Fortunately, unintentional gun deaths have declined over the last century for all ages, falling from 3.1 per 100,000 in 1903 to 0.3 per 100,000 in 1998. One program with demonstrated results is the National Rifle Association's Eddie Eagle program, which instructs young children to not touch a gun and to tell an adult. If Gordon wants to do something to improve safety, why doesn't he encourage such instruction in our schools?\n \n In a utopian world, all we'd have to do to save lives is write up a piece of paper and get it signed by the governor. In the real world, it isn't that easy. The much higher figures of \"child deaths\" trotted out by the anti-gun lobby actually represent a large number of gang homicides involving older male teenagers. Surely Gordon doesn't imagine that his storage bill will affect that problem.\n \n Gordon's bill takes a bizarre turn when it states the law \"shall not apply if the juvenile obtains possession of the firearm... in the lawful act of self-defense.\" But by then it's too late. Just ask Jessica Lynne Carpenter, a 14 year old from California, a state with \"lock up your safety\" laws. When a deranged man broke into her home wielding a pitchfork, Jessica was unable to access her father's firearm, even though she is a well-trained shooter. The man used his pitchfork to murder Jessica's two younger siblings, John William and Ashley Danielle, ages 7 and 9. Because of mindless disarmament laws, Jessica was reduced to waiting around for the police toshow up with the body bags.\n \n Previously, Democrats like Sen. Gordon would say we shouldn't regulate personal decisions in the bedroom. Apparently that rationale doesn't hold if the target of discrimination is gun owners\".",
