   "hoplophobia - n. - an irrational and morbid fear of guns, a term coined\n by Jeff Cooper, from Greek \"hoplites,\" weapon. Symptoms may include\n discomfort, disorientation, rapid pulse, sweating, faintness and more, \n at the mere sight or even thought of guns. Hoplophobes are common and \n should never be involved in setting gun policies, though many are hard \n at work in the rights-denial movement, and are arguably the greatest \n threat in the debate. Point out hoplophobic behavior when you see it, it \n is dangerous, and sufferers deserve pity. A hoplophobe (HOP-li-fobe) can \n often be cured by training, or by a day at the range.",
