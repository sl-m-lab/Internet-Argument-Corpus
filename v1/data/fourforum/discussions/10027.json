   "I would like for the materialists here to answer a simple question for me. Do you believe there is a fundamental difference between a living thing and a non-living thing? If so, what exactly is it that makes/causes this difference? I'm guessing that you guys would say that both living and non-living entities are products of the laws of chemistry and physics, but what exactly is it that makes something alive? Is it a physical thing? If so, what? Is it a non-physical thing? If so, what? \n \n \n I asked this question at a different forum, but instead of getting answers as to what makes something alive, I got a mere laundry list of characteristics of life. For example, one person said we are alive because we have metabolism and because we are able to replicate ourselves. Another said we are alive because all living things have cells. Another said living organisms are self-stablizing and self-activating.\n \n \n But while all these are examples of characteristics of life, none of these explain what makes or causes a living organism to be different from non-life. \n \n For example: If I had a cold, I might have a runny nose, a sore throat, drainage, a cough, etc -- but these things are not the CAUSE of my cold. Likewise the things just listed (respiration, metabolic processes, cells etc) are not the cause of life -- they are merely characteristics of life. \n \n Cold symptoms are not the cause of a cold just like respiration or metabolism is not the cause of life.\n \n I noticed WW talking about an organism being aware, while rocks or sticks are not aware. And while it's true that organisms have varying degrees of awareness, this is still not a cause -- it's just another characteristic, albeit a good one.\n \n But I am looking for the underlying cause: just like a cold is caused from a virus, life must have a cause; there must be something fundamentally different about a living organism than a non-living organism.\n \n I would suggest that whatever it is that makes something or someone alive, is the same thing that sees, hears tastes, feels and senses. It's the same entity that deciphers its environment and makes intelligent decisions accordingly. \n \n Here's Yahoo's definition of life:\n \n http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/life\n \n The property or quality that distinguishes living organisms from dead organisms and inanimate matter\n \n \n Ok.....so they've called life a property. Now what exactly IS this property? Is it a thing or a non-thing?\n \n \n So why is any of this important?\n \n For one thing, the whole is what interacts with the environment. Environmental cues do not work directly on parts, they work on the whole. But for this to be the case, there must be a whole entity -- or \"property\" -- of sorts lurking on the inside to accept and decipher the environmental feedback. Individual parts can't think or decide or make adjustments without being able to process information.\n \n But materialists deny that they are a whole -- they deny the entity that is themself. They deny that they -- the person who sees out the windows of their eyes -- is a non-physical entity who was created at the moment of their conception -- who's not only in control of their faculties, but also able to interact with their surroundings and make intelligent, complex decisions. They deny this because they deny they exist!\n \n But while evolutionists do not admit there is an internal \"whole\" otherwise known as \"them\" inside their bodies, the scientific evidence shows otherwise. \n \n Epigenetics and phenotypic plasticity are so destructive to ToE because they refute and disprove ToE by showing that organisms function as coherent wholes, a functional unity -- a non-physical property -- and not simply a conglomeration of independently-acting physical parts. This is why Robert Fisher, regarding phenotypic plasticity, once reported to have said that it is not surprising that such elaborate machinery should sometimes go wrong. (taken from Not By Chance by Lee Spetner.)\n \n But what this means is that since biological change stems -- not from an accidental change in parts -- but from the interaction of the property or whole, that there is no longer anything fundamental or concrete about life -- because you can't measure what you can't see or even detect! Thus, there are no building blocks or laws or equations to measure when it comes to life or change....which is ironic because that's exactly what today's science is all about -- measuring things and quantifying them. But if there's nothing fundamental or concrete about life -- including how life evolves -- it makes you wonder about the whole premise of science in regards to the study of life.\n \n It tells me that today's science -- the study of physical things -- is almost worthless.",

   "**\n Good questions, SS, and issues fundamental, basic, essential, to the evolutionary debate.\n \n You are right to point out that traits, characterists, and properties are always effects, not causes, and certainly never their own causes. Despite darwinism's fondness for \"spontaneous generation\" and creatio ex nihilo, ab nihilo. \n \n All causation reduces to the action of something ineffable that we, without a clue to what it actually is, call a force. Forces are known solely from what they do, not from what they are, because they are insubstantial, non-corporeal, and not the least materialistic. Forces are whatever it is that overcomes inertia and stasis and effects a change in current, immediate. proximate, local reality. Effects are always, as said before, current, immediate, proximate, and local with regard to the force/s acting upon that l something which is affected by that/those forces. The actual forces are never strictly local, but always universal and constanyt, although their applications/effects may be local and inconstant, relative and irregular.\n \n In short, every observable change in any given state of affairs, that is, any difference that is a difference, that is, every ex post facto observation of novel traits, properties, characteristics (essential or accidental, primary or secondary) is the observation of the after-effect of an exerted force. Stasis, or perfect entropy, i.e., perpetually undisturbed inertia, is the natural state of corporeal substance. Without force, matter does, and can do, nothing.\n \n With corporeal bits of stuff this is all readily observable, although darwinists and other mechanist/materialialists, having long ago hitched their horse behind the cart (and gotten reality exactly backwards), will howl in outraged denial. They still belief that matter is the essential substrate, therefore, that matter generates forces, not the actual and true opposite understanding. But never mind.\n \n The passive bits of stuff that move thanks to forces have made some forces obliquely identifiable and obliquely measurable--at least over the past few centuries since Newton. We now have identified four forces, and named them, and have found mathematical measures for them. Everyone knows them as gravity, etc. But moving bits of stuff are not the only phenomena empirically observable in our world. Moving bits of passive, corporeal stuff simply does not account for something as simple as a change of attitude or emotion. In short, the fouyr physical forces simply do not account for life, or any of the characteristics, properties, traits, i.e., observable effects, peculiar and particularly reserved for lifeforms, organisms that are still alive.\n \n That is why thinkers have long sought the psychical counterpart to the physical forces that overcome the natural inertia of corporeal stuff. The common solution is to simply posit a 'life force', and since that is all that was ever done wrt physical phenomena, it seems perfectly legitimate to do it for real and natural psychical phenomena., i.e., the phenomena that are intrinsic and inherent to biological forms, living organisms, only. Bergson called this necessary but elusive force, the \"elan vital\". I simply call it, \"Vitality\".",

Among all the reactions proposed so far for the formation of peptides under primordial earth conditions, the salt-induced peptide formation reaction in connection with adsorption processes on clay minerals would appear to be the simplest and most universal mechanism known to date. The properties of this reaction greatly favor the formation of biologically relevant peptides within a wide variation of environmental conditions such as temperature, pH, and the presence of inorganic compounds. The reaction-inherent preferences of certain peptide linkages make the argument of 'statistical impossibility' of the evolutionary formation of the 'right' peptides and proteins rather insignificant. Indeed, the fact that these sequences are reflected in the preferential sequences of membrane proteins of archaebacteria and prokaryonta distinctly indicates the relevance of this reaction for chemical peptide evolution. On the basis of these results and the recent findings of self-replicating peptides, some ideas have been developed as to the first steps leading to life on earth.\n ==================================================",

This one is rather more simple than the peptides made to date.\n \n ===============================\n \n Self-Reproducing Molecules Reported by MIT Researchers\n \n PRIMITIVE LIFE\n \n Self-Reproducing Molecules\n \n Reported by MIT Researchers\n \n By Eugene F. Mallove\n \n News Office\n \n A significant step toward understanding the origin of life may have been \n made by a group of MIT researchers. Led by Professor Julius Rebek, Jr. \n of the Department of Chemistry, they have created an extraordinary self-\n replicating molecular system that they say might be regarded as a \n \"primitive sign of life.\"\n \n It is not life itself, of course, but it is a kind of molecular model of \n how self-replication\u00d1a most fundamental life process\u00d1can occur.\n \n In work recently reported in the Journal of the American Chemical \n Society, Professor Rebek and his coworkers, Tjama Tjivikua, a graduate \n student from Namibia, and Pablo Ballester, a visiting scientist from \n the University of Palma in Mallorca, Spain, described the creation of an \n extraordinary self-replicating molecular system. \n \n Ordinarily, it takes the complex biochemical machinery of a cell to \n reproduce protein molecules. The building blocks of life simply don't \n replicate themselves by themselves they need help\u00d1lots of it\u00d1from \n enzymes and above all from information carried in DNA and RNA.\n \n How the whole business of molecular replication got started has been and \n remains one of the central mysteries of the origin of life. The origin \n of life is a classic \"chicken-and-egg\" dilemma. In the presumed \n molecular evolution on primitive Earth, what came first, proteins or the \n nucleic acids RNA and DNA? And remember that the enzymes necessary to \n make proteins are themselves proteins, where did they come from? \n \n Amazingly, the laboratory-made molecule that Professor Rebek and his \n colleagues have created can reproduce itself without the \"outside\" \n assistance of enzymes. As such, and because of its specific \n constitution, the molecule embodies some of the \"template\" qualities of \n a nucleic acid, and some of the structural qualities of a protein.\n \n The researchers say in their paper, \"At best, this can be regarded as a \n primitive sign of life; at the very least, the system offers a bridge \n between the information of nucleic acids and the synthesis of amide \n bonds. It should be possible to design systems capable of peptide \n [protein] synthesis on a nucleic acid backbone and thereby provide \n models for events that occurred some time ago.\" That \"some time ago\"\u00d1in \n case you missed it in the understated scientific prose\u00d1is four billion \n years ago on primitive Earth.\n \n Technically, the self-replicating compound made by the MIT group is \n called an amino adenosine triacid ester (AATE). This molecule was \n initially formed by reacting two other molecules. [\n \n The AATE replicates by attracting to one of its ends anester molecule, \n and to its other end an amino adenosine molecule. These molecules react \n to form another AATE. The \"parent\" and \"child\" AATE molecules then break \n apart and can go on to build still more AATE molecules.\n \n Professor Rebek's research is a continuation of work he began at the \n University of Pittsburgh. Professor Rebek has been on the MIT faculty \n since the spring of 1989. His work is supported by the National Science \n Foundation. \n ======================================",

Similar mutually beneficial relationships can operate at the molecular level in the form of a hypercycle, a collective of two or more self-replicating species interlinked through a cyclic catalytic network1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The superposition of cross-catalysis onto autocatalytic replication integrates the members of the hypercycle into a single system that reproduces through a second-order (or higher) form of nonlinear autocatalysis. The hypercycle population as a whole is therefore able to compete more efficiently for existing resources than any one member on its own. In addition, the effects of beneficial mutations of any one member are spread over the entire population. The formation of hypercycles has been suggested as an important step in the transition from inanimate to living chemistry6 , and a large number of hypercycles are expected to be embedded within the complex networks of living systems7. But only one naturally occurring hypercycle has been well documented8, while two autocatalytic chemical systems may contain vestiges of hypercyclic organization9,10. Here we report a chemical system that constitutes a clear example of a minimal hypercyclic network, in which two otherwise competitive self-replicating peptides symbiotically catalyse each others' production.",

In fact, that comparison is blatantly silly. A car is an artefact, and builder/designers can repair their own artefacts with no help from the artefact itself. IOW, a totally broken down car, one that does not 'function' at all, can be repaired, so that it 'functions' once again. And as it happens, many, if not all of them, are repaired, have their 'function' restored, at some time or other. To the best of my knowledge, no living organism that loses all power to function, that is, dies, has ever recovered that ability, with or without the aid of repairmen. The same applies to parts of cars and parts of organisms. A dead brain cannot become 'undead'. A dead heart can only be replaced,(by a pump, or by somebody else's healthy, functioning heart), not 'sent to the shop to be rebuilt'--whereas batteries can be re-charged, and motors can be rebuilt. This would-be analogy does not stand up to scrutiny.\n \n \n\n Life functions. If it doesn't, it stops living, that is, it dies. \n\n \n **\n As always with mechanists, effect is mistaken for cause. The horse is firmly placed at the back of the cart. The actual case is that if something stops living, then death, (i.e., loss of life), causes it to cease to function. It does not die, i.e., lose its life because it ceases to to function. A paralysed person may have limbs that do not function, but are not dead. Just as a car can, and often does, have parts that do not function, but are not 'dead', either.\n To be inoperative is not to be 'dead', although to be dead is to be 'inoperative'. They are correlated, but not synonymous, (as you would have us believe).\n \n \n\n Yet, just like there is no need for a tangible \"workingness\" of a working car to distinguish it from a broken one,\n\n \n **\n Duh?!?!?

It seems to kind of relate to the point in my OP, which is that whatever it is that makes something alive is some sort of internal, singular, holistic, non-physical unit.\n \n We know that the environment cannot work directly on specific body parts, it works directly on the organism itself. Thus, something somewhere inside the organism has to not only be aware of its surroundings, but it also must be able to react accordingly and organize a physical response. \n \n The following is about brain function, but notice how science is learning that the brain cannot be dissected an analyzed in chunks; it must be seen as a system:\n \n http://www.creationsafaris.com/crev200706.htm\n \n Systems neuroscience aims to understand how billions of neurons in the mammalian brain support goal-directed behavior, such as decision making. Deciphering how individual neurons respond to sensory inputs or motor decisions has focused on delineating the neural basis of these processes in discrete regions of the brain's cortex, and has provided key insights into the physiological basis of behavior. However, evidence from neuropsychological, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging studies in humans has revealed that interactions between widespread neural regions in the brain underlie fluid, organized behavior. Two papers in this issue, by Womelsdorf et al. on page 1609 and Saalmann et al. on page 1612, and a recent paper in Science by Buschman and Miller, unravel the details of these interactions by assessing the simultaneous activity of neurons in multiple sites of the mammalian brain. The studies show that network interactions among anatomically discrete brain regions underlie cognitive processing and dispel any phrenological notion that a given innate mental faculty is based solely in just one part of the brain\n \n So it sounds like the brain operates much like the genome. Somehow, different areas of the brain operate simultaneously to accomplish tasks, which, to me, would require direct communication from a common source. What is the source?
