   "How does your theory fit with the idea that Humans worship or pray? And while we're at it how about reason, to ask why etc.? \nCan we agree that humans and other \"closely related\" (ie have similar DNA) animals share the same physical aspects and that we are thus only considering aspects of the mind?\n \n In considering the mind, the keys I feel to humans are our imagination and our ability to communicate. We can extrapolate beyond what we sense around us in the present. We can construct how the future might be based on what we know now. We can cope with the idea of something existing even though we cannot sense it. We can communicate concepts, from emotions through expressions of our imagination. But is our imagination and/ or our ability to communicate unique?\n \n Establishing this is difficult as we must construct ways of testing for it in other animals. These tests must be free of anthropomorphic assumptions, but also must not set the \"entry level\" of the existence of such attributes at too high a level.\n \n Various experiments that I've read about (ie I've no references at the moment, but can dig them out if required) suggest that other primates have at least simple concepts of morality and that they can grasp the concept of hidden objects still existing. Chimps can be trained to have a 500 word or so language, are able to perform simply maths based tasks and can solve puzzles.\n \n Does any other animal worship amd pray? The answer has to be that we do not know, I think. Many young mammals play and learn from their parents. Children play and learn too. They learn a lot through asking \"why\" (ie through language). Humans continue to play and to ask why and seek to learn even in adulthood though. Asking \"why\" eventually leads to \"why are we here\" and the first steps to religion have been taken. But dolphins continue to play in adulthood too. Do they ask \"why?\" too? Do though worship? We don't know.\n \n G.",

   "Dolphins perform better in communication experiments than chimps. The problem is that chimps have no vocal chords wheras we have some very flexible ones. Therefore chimps are at a communication disadvantage. Dolphins have an even richer communication range than our vocal chords provide and they use it.\n \n In lab studies experimenters have responed with high pitch sounds when the dolphins make one. This set up a kind of conversation. But when the dolphin went out of human hearing range no response was made. The result was that the dolphin quickly learnt what the human hearing range was and didn't try and communicate outside that range again.\n \n There are also quite complex social interactions and reasoning observed in the wild. One example involves a school of dolphins which travelled into a certain bay once in a while. On one occasion a boat was in the bay to study them. They found that as the dolphins approached the bay they stopped and lots of dolphin \"chatter\" was detected. Then one of them left the group and swam to the ship and around it. After it was finished it returned to the group and more chatter was heard for a few more minutes until the whole group then continued on its way to the bay.\n \n Now you can make of that what you want. Obviously without \"mind probes\" nothing can be known for sure but it does seem that the school detected the boat in the bay, discussed it, and sent a scout to see what it was. WHen the scout got back they discussed it again and continued on their way.\n \n Unfortunately for dolphins they have no hands and fingers so even if they are near human intelligence they will never be able to build things or create fire.",

   "very interesting. yes I heard about the chimps who were taught sign language\n\n \n Void, \n \n In the study I was talking about the chimps were literally taught to do arithmetic.\n \n First, what was used were objects.\n Later the chimps were taught the symbols 1,2,3,4,5 for those objects.\n They were not taught the number zero.\n \n The result of the study was that the chimps were able to perform simple\n addition and subtraction. The highest number that I recall they were asked to\n add up to, was 5.\n Though they were never taught the number zero, the chimps were able to signify that they understood the concept of zero.\n \n In the earliest numbering systems, humans did not even invent a symbol to represent zero, as it was not thought to be a number, until someone realized\n that in order to progress a bit further, it would be a good idea to have a symbol for zero.\n \n An African Grey Parrot was taught the concept of \"dissimilar\", it was also taught a few basic colors. And as that variety of parrot can speak,\n when asked what was different about 3 of the same items, it replied: \"color\".\n For different types of items that had the same color, it replied correctly: \"shape\".\n \n The research is current, and has been conducted by a now well known Professor at a College or University in one of the Western States.\n \n A key used to unlock a box containing food for an Orangutan was moved from it's usual location by one person. When the next person entered the room he asked the Orang, if it wanted what was in the box. The Orang pointed to the key that was moved from its usual location. The key was not reachable by the Orang, and could only be reached by the person.\n \n People like to think of themselves as quite different than Apes. However, researchers have had to redefine the difference between Man and Ape on so many occasions, for so many reasons, and to such a fine degree, that I could not even understand what Researchers of Animal Behavior are now defining as\n being different between the two species. I do know, that they have defined it as consiousness, but in a very specific way.\n \n The fact is that we are not so different from Apes, as we might like to be.\n There are differences, but there are more similarities than people would like to admit or know about.\n \n (I'm absolutely certain that the research on the African Grey Parrot can be found with any decent search engine.) All of the studies mentioned were shown on NOVA programs on PBS during the past 10 years.\n \n BTW. Void, Did you know that Apes have taught their children the sign language they were taught?",

Each symbol's meaning has been tested as well.\n \n Perhaps the most convincing evidience of the ability for chimps to conceptualize, and communicate via sign language, touch screen symbols, flash cards, and arithmetic is the simplest of experiments with chimps, in which they were asked via (sign language) to perform a variety of tasks that they had never performed before.\n \n For example: chimps have been taught the words \"into\" , \"put\", \"bring\", \"take outside\" , and other verbs and nouns, as well.\n \n If a chimp had be taught a specific task, it would certianly be reason to suspect that the response from the chimp could not be considered valid.\n \n However, the task that the chiomp was asked to perform had never been done before by the chimp, nor had the chimp ever seen anyone do the task.\n \n So, when a chimp was asked to do a task like: \"get the can from the closet. Put the doll, inside the can, and take the can outside.\"\n \n I expect you will accept that the chimp accomplished it without further instructions, as suspicious, as anyone like yourself that can not fathom a chimp being capable of understanding the actual meaning of words in a language, but would have no problem accepting that perahps as much as 80 percent of the posts here, have no basis in Science, and can be thought of as being no different than the delusions of a psychiotic.. \n \n I opt out of debates with people that make absutd claims, as I know that their motives are to protect religious dogma, and disregard reality.",

As the dolphins approached clicking noises were heard -- possibly sonar soundings. They gathered into a group in nearby shallow water about 400 feet from the barrier. During this time lots of clicks and squeaky-door sounds were recorded. A scout left the group and examined the barrier. When the dolphin returned he was greeted in the same manner as before. After about four minutes of conversation another scout was sent out. Upon his return he too was greeted with the explosion of whistles. After about two and a half minutes the dolphins merrily clicked through the barrier. Returning into the bay that afternoon, and the next morning leaving the bay, the pod did not send a scout when they came to the barrier.....nor did they even slow down\n",

I did not want a creation evolution debate but...........\n \"I believe that there are characteristics which are solely attributable to humans. Before I post my thoughts I would like to hear others. I don't wish to influence any answers. \n So what do you all think. By the Way, \"nothing\" is also a reasonable response, but it will be hard to prove.\"\n\n \n \"If there was ever a moment when man was only an animal, we can if we choose make a fancy picture of his career transferred to some other animal. An entertaining fanasia might be made in which elephants built in elephantine architecture, with towers and turrets like tusks and trunks, cities beyond the scale of any colossus. A pleasant fable might be conceived in which a cow had developed a costume, and put on four boots and two pairs of trousers. We could imagine a Supermonkey more marvellous than any Superman, a quadrumanous creature carving and painting with his hands and cooking and carpentering with his feet. But if we are considering what did happen, we shall certainly decide that man has distanced everything else with a distance like that of the astronomical spaces and a speed like that of the still thunderbolt of the light.\"\n \n \"It is the simple truth that man does differ from the brutes in kind and not in degree; and the proof of it is here; that it sounds like a truism to say that the most primitive man drew a picture of a monkey and that it sounds like a joke to say that the most intelligent monkey drew a picture of a man. Something of division and disproportion has appeared; and it is unique. Art is the signature of man.\" \n \n \"When all is said, the main fact that the record of the reindeer men attests, along with all other records, is that the reindeer man could draw and the reindeer could not. If the reindeer man was as much an animal as the reindeer, it was all the more extraordinary that he could do what all other animals could not. If he was an ordinary product of biological growth, like any other beast or bird, then it is all the more extraordinary that he was not in the least like any other beast or bird. He seems rather more supernatural as a natural product than as a supernatural one...For in the plain matter like the pictures there is in fact not a trace of any such development or degree. Monkeys did not begin pictures and men finish them; Pithecanthropus did not draw a reindeer badly and Homo Sapiens draw it well. The higher animals did not draw better and better portraits; the dog did not paint better in his best period than in his early bad manner as a jackal; the wild horse was not an Impressionist and the race-horse a Post-Impressionist. All we can say of this notion of reproducing things in shadow or representative shape is that it exists nowhere in nature except in man; and that we cannot even talk about it without treating man as something separate from nature. In other words, every sane sort of history must begin with man as man, a thing standing absolute and alone.\"\n \n \"In the land lit by that neighboring star, whose blaze is the broad daylight, there are many and very various things, motionless and moving. There moves among them a race that is in its relation to others a race of gods. The fact is not lessened but emphasised because it can behave like a race of demons...It is customary to insist that man resembles the other creatures. Yes; and that very resemblance he alone can see. The fish does not trace the fish-bone pattern in the fowls of the air; or the elephant and the emu compare skeletons. Even in the sense in which man is at one with the universe it is an utterly lonely universality. The very sense that he is united with all things is enough to sunder him from all.\"\n \n \"The more we really look at man as an animal, the less he will look like one.\n \n The simplest truth about man is that he is a very strange being; almost in the sense of being a stranger here on the earth...He has much more of the external appearance of one bringing alien habits from another land than of a mere growth of this one. He has an unfair advantage and an unfair disadvantage. He cannot sleep in his own skin; he cannot trust his own instincts. He is at once a creator moving miraculous hands and fingers and a kind of cripple. He is wrapped in artificial bandages called clothes; he is propped on artificial crutches called furniture. His mind has the same doubtful liberties and the same wild limitations. Alone among the animals, he is shaken with the beautiful madness called laughter...Alone among the animals he feels...the mystery of shame. Whether we praise these things as natural to man or abuse them as artificial in nature, they remain in the same sense unique. This is realised by the whole popular instinct called religion.\"\n \n \"Suppose that one bird out of a thousand birds began to do one of the thousand things that man had already done even in the morning of the world; and we can be quite certain that the onlooker would not regard such a bird as a mere evolutionary variety of the other birds; he would regard it as a fearful wild-fowl indeed...That bird would tell the augurs, not of something that would happen, but of something that had happened. That something would be the appearance of a mind with a new dimension of depth; a mind like that of man. If there be no God, no other mind  could conceivable have foreseen it...There may be a broken trail of stones and bones faintly suggesting the development of the human body. There is nothing even faintly suggesting such a development of the human mind. It was not and it was; we know not in what instant or infinity of years. Something happened; and it has all the appearance of a transaction outside time.\"\n \n THE EVERLASTING MAN  by G.K. CHESTERTON",

   "\"If there was ever a moment when man was only an animal, we can if we choose make a fancy picture of his career transferred to some other animal. An entertaining fanasia might be made in which elephants built in elephantine architecture, with towers and turrets like tusks and trunks, cities beyond the scale of any colossus. A pleasant fable might be conceived in which a cow had developed a costume, and put on four boots and two pairs of trousers. We could imagine a Supermonkey more marvellous than any Superman, a quadrumanous creature carving and painting with his hands and cooking and carpentering with his feet. But if we are considering what did happen, we shall certainly decide that man has distanced everything else with a distance like that of the astronomical spaces and a speed like that of the still thunderbolt of the light.\"\n \n \"It is the simple truth that man does differ from the brutes in kind and not in degree; and the proof of it is here; that it sounds like a truism to say that the most primitive man drew a picture of a monkey and that it sounds like a joke to say that the most intelligent monkey drew a picture of a man. Something of division and disproportion has appeared; and it is unique. Art is the signature of man.\" \n \n \"When all is said, the main fact that the record of the reindeer men attests, along with all other records, is that the reindeer man could draw and the reindeer could not. If the reindeer man was as much an animal as the reindeer, it was all the more extraordinary that he could do what all other animals could not. If he was an ordinary product of biological growth, like any other beast or bird, then it is all the more extraordinary that he was not in the least like any other beast or bird. He seems rather more supernatural as a natural product than as a supernatural one...For in the plain matter like the pictures there is in fact not a trace of any such development or degree. Monkeys did not begin pictures and men finish them; Pithecanthropus did not draw a reindeer badly and Homo Sapiens draw it well. The higher animals did not draw better and better portraits; the dog did not paint better in his best period than in his early bad manner as a jackal; the wild horse was not an Impressionist and the race-horse a Post-Impressionist. All we can say of this notion of reproducing things in shadow or representative shape is that it exists nowhere in nature except in man; and that we cannot even talk about it without treating man as something separate from nature. In other words, every sane sort of history must begin with man as man, a thing standing absolute and alone.\"\n \n \"In the land lit by that neighboring star, whose blaze is the broad daylight, there are many and very various things, motionless and moving. There moves among them a race that is in its relation to others a race of gods. The fact is not lessened but emphasised because it can behave like a race of demons...It is customary to insist that man resembles the other creatures. Yes; and that very resemblance he alone can see. The fish does not trace the fish-bone pattern in the fowls of the air; or the elephant and the emu compare skeletons. Even in the sense in which man is at one with the universe it is an utterly lonely universality. The very sense that he is united with all things is enough to sunder him from all.\"\n \n \"The more we really look at man as an animal, the less he will look like one.\n \n The simplest truth about man is that he is a very strange being; almost in the sense of being a stranger here on the earth...He has much more of the external appearance of one bringing alien habits from another land than of a mere growth of this one. He has an unfair advantage and an unfair disadvantage. He cannot sleep in his own skin; he cannot trust his own instincts. He is at once a creator moving miraculous hands and fingers and a kind of cripple. He is wrapped in artificial bandages called clothes; he is propped on artificial crutches called furniture. His mind has the same doubtful liberties and the same wild limitations. Alone among the animals, he is shaken with the beautiful madness called laughter...Alone among the animals he feels...the mystery of shame. Whether we praise these things as natural to man or abuse them as artificial in nature, they remain in the same sense unique. This is realised by the whole popular instinct called religion.\"\n \n \"Suppose that one bird out of a thousand birds began to do one of the thousand things that man had already done even in the morning of the world; and we can be quite certain that the onlooker would not regard such a bird as a mere evolutionary variety of the other birds; he would regard it as a fearful wild-fowl indeed...That bird would tell the augurs, not of something that would happen, but of something that had happened. That something would be the appearance of a mind with a new dimension of depth; a mind like that of man. If there be no God, no other mind  could conceivable have foreseen it...There may be a broken trail of stones and bones faintly suggesting the development of the human body. There is nothing even faintly suggesting such a development of the human mind. It was not and it was; we know not in what instant or infinity of years. Something happened; and it has all the appearance of a transaction outside time.\"\n \n THE EVERLASTING MAN  by G.K. CHESTERTON\n\n \n I have no more reason to believe that evolution of anything at all, has to do with an invisible superpower, than I do for a cause of the creation of the universe.\n \n I'll stick with nothing else but what Science can prove, or gives reason to suggest is true.

   "Originally Posted by maximus\n \"If there was ever a moment when man was only an animal, we can if we choose make a fancy picture of his career transferred to some other animal. An entertaining fanasia might be made in which elephants built in elephantine architecture, with towers and turrets like tusks and trunks, cities beyond the scale of any colossus. A pleasant fable might be conceived in which a cow had developed a costume, and put on four boots and two pairs of trousers. We could imagine a Supermonkey more marvellous than any Superman, a quadrumanous creature carving and painting with his hands and cooking and carpentering with his feet. But if we are considering what did happen, we shall certainly decide that man has distanced everything else with a distance like that of the astronomical spaces and a speed like that of the still thunderbolt of the light.\"\n \n \"It is the simple truth that man does differ from the brutes in kind and not in degree; and the proof of it is here; that it sounds like a truism to say that the most primitive man drew a picture of a monkey and that it sounds like a joke to say that the most intelligent monkey drew a picture of a man. Something of division and disproportion has appeared; and it is unique. Art is the signature of man.\" \n \n \"When all is said, the main fact that the record of the reindeer men attests, along with all other records, is that the reindeer man could draw and the reindeer could not. If the reindeer man was as much an animal as the reindeer, it was all the more extraordinary that he could do what all other animals could not. If he was an ordinary product of biological growth, like any other beast or bird, then it is all the more extraordinary that he was not in the least like any other beast or bird. He seems rather more supernatural as a natural product than as a supernatural one...For in the plain matter like the pictures there is in fact not a trace of any such development or degree. Monkeys did not begin pictures and men finish them; Pithecanthropus did not draw a reindeer badly and Homo Sapiens draw it well. The higher animals did not draw better and better portraits; the dog did not paint better in his best period than in his early bad manner as a jackal; the wild horse was not an Impressionist and the race-horse a Post-Impressionist. All we can say of this notion of reproducing things in shadow or representative shape is that it exists nowhere in nature except in man; and that we cannot even talk about it without treating man as something separate from nature. In other words, every sane sort of history must begin with man as man, a thing standing absolute and alone.\"\n \n \"In the land lit by that neighboring star, whose blaze is the broad daylight, there are many and very various things, motionless and moving. There moves among them a race that is in its relation to others a race of gods. The fact is not lessened but emphasised because it can behave like a race of demons...It is customary to insist that man resembles the other creatures. Yes; and that very resemblance he alone can see. The fish does not trace the fish-bone pattern in the fowls of the air; or the elephant and the emu compare skeletons. Even in the sense in which man is at one with the universe it is an utterly lonely universality. The very sense that he is united with all things is enough to sunder him from all.\"\n \n \"The more we really look at man as an animal, the less he will look like one.\n \n The simplest truth about man is that he is a very strange being; almost in the sense of being a stranger here on the earth...He has much more of the external appearance of one bringing alien habits from another land than of a mere growth of this one. He has an unfair advantage and an unfair disadvantage. He cannot sleep in his own skin; he cannot trust his own instincts. He is at once a creator moving miraculous hands and fingers and a kind of cripple. He is wrapped in artificial bandages called clothes; he is propped on artificial crutches called furniture. His mind has the same doubtful liberties and the same wild limitations. Alone among the animals, he is shaken with the beautiful madness called laughter...Alone among the animals he feels...the mystery of shame. Whether we praise these things as natural to man or abuse them as artificial in nature, they remain in the same sense unique. This is realised by the whole popular instinct called religion.\"\n \n \"Suppose that one bird out of a thousand birds began to do one of the thousand things that man had already done even in the morning of the world; and we can be quite certain that the onlooker would not regard such a bird as a mere evolutionary variety of the other birds; he would regard it as a fearful wild-fowl indeed...That bird would tell the augurs, not of something that would happen, but of something that had happened. That something would be the appearance of a mind with a new dimension of depth; a mind like that of man. If there be no God, no other mind  could conceivable have foreseen it...There may be a broken trail of stones and bones faintly suggesting the development of the human body. There is nothing even faintly suggesting such a development of the human mind. It was not and it was; we know not in what instant or infinity of years. Something happened; and it has all the appearance of a transaction outside time.\"\n \n THE EVERLASTING MAN by G.K. CHESTERTON  \n \n \n \nOriginally Posted by Void\n Chimps can recognise their reflection in a mirror, a cat cannot.

They are different.\n \n interesting\n\n \n \n But does not evolution say that there can be NO difference in kind, simply differences in degree?

   "What separates man from ape?\n \n Man is a spiritual being, with a capacity for thought and language. he totally dominates the animal world and has been able to plumb the heights and depths of the entire universe, even to the extent of investigating, and partially understanding, his own DNA.

   "Man is a spiritual being, with a capacity for thought and language.\n\n Even if you are correct, what does the first have to do with the other two? Even if you are correct, how do you observe this spiritual nature. How big is it? Does it have mass? Is the spiritual nature of everyone the same?\n \nhe totally dominates the animal world...\n\n Really? So did T. rex. Are you saying that we differ because we are at the top of the food chain?\n \n...and has been able to plumb the heights and depths of the entire universe, even to the extent of investigating, and partially understanding, his own DNA.\n\n But I don't think that answers the question. So, we're pretty smart. Other animals are smart too, just not as smart as we are. And I'm not sure how understanding something about DNA is what makes us different from chimps.\n \nParadoxically, however, we are always wanting to deny the divine in our natures:\n\n You are? I'm not. It just doesn't have any place in science. Science studies the natural, not the supernatural, so answering a question by claiming supernatural intervention doesn't answer the question at all.\n \nto understand, measure and judge ourselves according to that which is lower rather than higher.\n\n But to claim divine intervention or supernatural powers doesn't measure or judge anything. Does everyone have the same amount of \"divine\" in his nature? How does one measure that?\n \nThat very ability to choose the beliefs which govern our lives sets us apart from all other animals.\n\n Sure. But I don't think that answers the question either. What you are saying is that there is no difference except that some supernatural being intervened. POOF! Great. Unless you can quantify all of that you are just avoiding the question.\n \nAccording to the bible, the highest reality is God, and man was created by him.\n\n What does the Bible have to do with it? You can't even show that the Bible is inspired by God. You can claim so, but you can't support that claim except by faith.\n \nHe was made 'in his image, after his likeness'.\n\n POOF! And you still haven't answered the question. I guess then we should ask how does God differ from a chimp?\n \nDarwinism attempts to contradict the obvious differences between man and the other animals by suggesting that in the past the differences were much smaller.\n\n That's nonsense. Darwinism makes no such attempt. In fact, Darwinism attempts to explain differences based on observations made in the real world. No magic involved.\n \nIt is a philosophy which seeks to minimise the divine and maximise the physical,\n\n More nonsense. First of all, in a strict manner of speaking, Darwinism existed in the last half of the 19th century. It was replaced, or rather subsumed, by the synthesis of genetics and Darwinism. It became known as neo-Darwinism. I have always just called it evolutionary biology. And now, it's not a philosophy. It is a body of knowledge based on real observations of the natural world. The theories offer explanations for the many, many observations. And like all sciences, it is linked to other fields of study by supporting evidence. And only a fool would suggest that the divine is subject to scientific inquiry. That is why evolutionary doesn't seek to minimize it. The divine is relevant to evolutionary biology in exactly the same manner that it is relevant to plumbing. Neither deals with God because both lack the tools to observe God. Neither denies God.\n \n...in the hope that it will seem plausible to imagine an evolutionary transition from animal to human.\n\n Nope. There isn't any hope. If the evidence pointed to some other origin for humanity, science would accept that. Science, evolutionary biology included, makes observations, forms hypotheses, makes predictions and then tests those predictions.\n \nThe simplest explanation for the origin of man's intelligence and capabilities is that he proceeded from a supreme intelligence, an intellect of unfathomable magnitude, a vast reservoir of cognitive capabilities.\n\n Great! Please enumerate the steps by which this was accomplished. So far you have offered an assertion of magic. You have avoided answering the question.\n \nthe question is not what separates man from ape, but rather, what separates ape from man?.\n\n Is that supposed to mean something or are you just trying to look wise?\n \n In fact, I'll give an answer to the question. Bipedalism. I think this may have been the key. It offered a better position to look for danger, it freed the hands so that more food might be carried to a safe place, it reduced the total body surface that was exposed to the direct sun, thereby making temperature regulation easier, it was a more efficient means for travel. And with the hands free, it made too use possible and that may have made a bigger brain an advantage.",
