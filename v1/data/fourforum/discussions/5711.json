   "Asking for a \"logical\" reason something is moral or immoral is like asking someone to tell you what purple smells like--morality is a philosophical issue, not a strictly objective one.\n Uh, in philosophy - the analytic tradition, the productive one - morality is treated as an objective subject, to be handled logically and rationally. Some philosophers, such as Immanuel Kant, have even argued that morality is purely a rational thing.\n \n http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/morality-definition/",

   "\"Come now, and let us reason together,\" Says the LORD. Isaiah 1:18\n \n Logic is God thinking.\n \n Christ himself is represented as wisdom, logic, or right thinking. \n \n In the beginning was the Logos, and the Logos  was with God, and the Logos  was God. Jn. 1:1\n \n Logic is an attribute of God. God is not subject to logic in the sense that he is beneath it, nor is logic an \"invention\" of God. God is always utterly logical, because logic is part of who he is. \n \n Logic is the set of rules we must follow to think like God thinks, which is to think rightly. \n \n Logic undergirds morality. Otherwise, we can make no distinctions between right and wrong. \n \n Logic undergirds truth. Otherwise, we can make no distinctions between truth and error. \n \n Logic is covenantal. God himself holds us accountable for thinking rightly, because we are his creatures made in his image.\n http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~sjreeves/cm/logic.html",

   "Logic aligns realities upon life. But curruption creates irrationality, even in religion.\n \n Christ said that people are supposed to try to understand what he taught (Mark 7:14). He referred to himself as the teacher (Mat 23:8).\n \n Teaching and understanding align the mind upon objective reality. Reason is the process. Logic is strict reason.\n \n Reason is making relationships between realities. Consistent relationships are the test of truth. Truth is the product. Truth is a correct relationship to objective reality.\n \n Christ said he is the truth (John 14:6) and the truth would set people free (John 8:32). That means we are supposed to be producing truth.\n \n There is often a tendency to do otherwise. Christ attempted to correct that problem.\n \n The problem is that subconscious forces create the opposite result. They create irrationality.\n \n When irrationality gets habitual, the whole concept of reason or logic is opposed. Reason is replaced by the assumption that what feels right is more reliable than logic.\n \n There is a tendency to rely upon authority as a source of reality and assume that logic is some sort of trickery or brainwashing which must be avoided.\n \n A truism is that all authority over reality is a corruption. Authority over reality can never be constructive. Reality must always be handled through procedures including logic which authority precludes. Authority and logic are mutually exclusive determiners of correctness of reality.\n \n Logic and reason are not incidental characteristics of reality; they are mental activities applied for the purpose of determining correctness of reality. There can only be one determiner for correctness of reality; it cannot be both authority and logic, because different minds are not going to draw the same conclusions, and the process can never be perfect and complete.\n \n Some persons assume that anyone who attacks authority must be dead to sin. Guess what. There is more than one purpose for authority. One purpose is valid, and one is not. Corrupters use the valid purpose for promoting the invalid purpose.\n \n The valid purpose of authority is to make decisions related to actions for controlling processes. Invalid authority is to determine correctness of reality by authority, which is dictating reality.\n \n As far as Christians are concerned, Christ had the highest authority possible. But he never allowed authority to replace logic (as frauds always do). He taught the logic of morality.\n http://nov55.com/rel/lgc.html",

   "Whoa there, your post was going great till you put gay lobbyists in the same camp as Rosa Parks and women's rights activists. Do you actually seriously think you are part of that line of activism? Sorry, they weren't pushing immoral living.\n\n \n YOU are pushing immoral living by judging people and trying to stigmatize them, just because they are gay. That is hurtful to people. We see the harm when people are taught to be ashamed. Being gay is not immoral living.\n \n \nWhat you are about isn't even in the same universe as they were. It's not radicalism that gay lobbyists are about. It's not even really equality. It's about wanting to live a certain way and do what you want to do even if it's immoral, to the point of convincing people it's not.\n\n \n But it's not immoral to live this way. Of course, we are not going to say it's immoral, why would we? It's up to you to convince us that it is immoral, as with any other type of living that isn't harming anyone, but which is important to that person or group of people and is also an expression of identity.\n \n \nAnd then using marriage as a means to an end to further legitimize it. On a deeper level, it's simply a matter of petty social rebellion.\n\n \n Bull. Gay marriage has come as far as it has only because it has broad support in society. It wouldn't have come as far as it has if being gay was simply a stigma. But you go on, and keep trying to convince yourself otherwise, as you watch these changes occuring. The tables are turning on the way you live, judging and attempting to stigmatize gay people.",
