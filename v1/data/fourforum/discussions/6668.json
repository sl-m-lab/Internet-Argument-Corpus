   "sins have no direct correlation to harming others. there are acts that harm others that are not sinful, and there are sins that do not harm others\n \n there is only one definition for sin. a sin is a transgression on a religious commandment (usually the commandments in the bible). therefore, whatever the bible says is a sin is a sin\n \n with that said, trying to figure if some action is a sin is a waste of time for 2 main reasons. 1, if youre an atheist, or dont subscribe to the bible, then what the bible says is irrelevant. 2, if you are a believer, then the golden rule (which is closely related to whether something harms others) is the main guide for interacting with others that one needs to follow",

   "there are actually 2 kinds of sin: sin against god, and sin against your neighbor (people you interact with). in the new testament jesus sums them up in the 2 \"commandments of love\", and they rightly sum up all the commandments of the entire old testament.\n \n the first is to love god with all your heart, soul and mind. with the love for god comes honoring of his instructions and obedience of his commandments. it also entails sharing the gospel and living a life of purity and uprightness. to disregard these duties that are implied in loving god with all your heart, mind and soul is a sin, and it really has absolutely nothing to do with whether you harm your neighbor\n \n the second commandment is to love your neighbor as yourself. this entails doing things that you would like them do to you, such as protecting them from harm as you would yourself, and being courteous, helpful and compassionate. not fulfilling your duty to love others as a christian is a sin\n \n when you think about it, there really is nothing absolute about these commandments, since what \"you would have others do to you\" can vary from 1 person to another, although it is still the best guide for morality there is. also, wherever the 1st commnadment and the second might cause a conflict, one must use their discretion. for example, i think it is expedient to honor god by not giving your neighbor a light for his cigarette, even though if you were a smoker youd like him to do the same for you. but because smoking conflicts with the first commandment, it overrides the second. however, if in the middle of your daily devotion your neighbor asks you to call the 911 because his house is on fire, then it would be expedient to let the second commandment override the first\n \n so wez, i think the answer to your question is yes and no. something that harms nobody can be a sin, but you should never put another in harm's way in the name of being obedient to god\n \n and yes, this should be in the religious forum",
