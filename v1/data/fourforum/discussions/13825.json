   "British hostages: Pirates will kill us in days - CNN.com\n \n \nA British couple held hostage by pirates for more than three months have told of brutal treatment at the hand of their captors who they say are perilously close to killing them.\n \n In separate telephone interviews with CNN affiliate ITN, Paul and Rachel Chandler pleaded for help and spoke of their fears that they were just days away from death.\n \n An emotional Rachel Chandler also spoke of how she thought \"dying would actually be an easy way out\" and how she wanted to see her husband \"at least once before we die.\"\n \n The Chandlers were taken by pirates from their 38-foot yacht, the Lynn Rival, just days after setting sail from the Seychelles islands for Tanzania.\n \n Their captors initially demanded a ransom of $7 million, but the British government -- in line with longstanding policy -- has refused to pay.\n \n \"Please, please find a way of helping us because it really is a very desperate situation here,\" Rachel Chandler said in the latest interview, in which she said she had not seen her husband for two weeks since they were violently separated.\n \n \"I've broken a tooth because I was hit on the head with something, probably the butt of a gun... I don't know... and yes, so we have been physically attacked.\"\n \n Rachel Chandler, 55, who along with her husband has been held for nearly 100 days, said the pirates had issued a new deadline.\n \n \"They've just told me that if they don't get the money within four or five days they'll kill one of us.\"\n \n Audibly close to tears, she also asked for a message to be passed on to her husband.\n \n \"The message to him is hang on for me because I hope -- my biggest hope -- is that I shall see him at least once before we die.\"\n \n She added: \"It's hard not to feel, well, dying would actually be an easy way out. It's hard to explain but it is when you're all on your own in this country and you've no idea where you are and no idea when something might happen and whether I'll see Paul again. It's just very, very despairing\"\n \n In a separate telephone interview 24 hours earlier, Paul Chandler, 59, described how they were separated and savagely beaten.\n \n \"We tried to stay together and they threw us to the ground and whipped us and beat Rachel with a rifle butt and I was dragged off, taken to a different location.\n \n \"I was allowed to telephone her about 12 days ago. Se said she was being tormented all the time and then she said she was giving up. They've lost patience. They set a deadline of three or four days, if they don't hear, then they say they will let us die.\n \n \"We're held in solitary confinement effectively. You know it's just [like being] treated as a captive animal.\"\n \n It was not clear under what conditions the captives, who have been in sporadic telephone and video contact with journalists, had been allowed telephone access. ITN said both conversations had been shared with the British Home Office and his family.\n \n Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office's official line on hostages says \"the government will not make substantive concession for hostage takers, including the payments of ransom.\"\n \n Pirates have been very active off the east coast of Africa in the past several years, operating out of lawless Somalia.\n \n Last week, pirates attempted to hijack an Indian crude oil vessel 105 nautical miles from Somalia, the EU's anti-piracy naval force said. The pirates opened fire on the ship and were later arrested.\n \n Piracy on the high-seas reached a six-year high in 2009, according to the International Maritime Bureau, which monitors shipping crimes.\n\n \n So why should merchant ships be required to go unarmed and defenseless in dangerous areas?",

As a deterrent, a self defense weapon doesn't need to be bigger, better, or have a better rate of fire than your adversary.\n \n You can be accosted by 10 attackers when you only have break barrel, single shot, trap gun.....\n \n ...the question is \"Even though I can only kill one of you, who is the single attacker who wants to die by being the first to commit?\"\n \n You probably won't get many volunteers to \"Take one for the team\". \n \n Attacker #1: \"You go first.\"\n Attacker #2: \"No, you go first.\"\n Attacker #3: \"Well, somebody needs to go first!\"\n Attacker #4: \"Who wants to be first?\"\n Attacker #5: \"Not me.

Why not #1 & #2?\"\n \n How about you, sinjin? Yeah, we're all armed to the teeth with machine guns compared to those poor ol' saps with their tiny little pistol over there on that boat. Why don't you be the first one to step over the rail? Oh, by the way, don't hurt them or we won't get any ransom money. You game? Or would you rather try that other sailboat over there with the British flag?\n \n Every decision we make is a cost/benefit analysis. EVERY decision. I'm making a decision right now. Is the benefit of expressing my opinion worth the cost of sitting here typing it right now? You are too. Is the benefit of reading it worth sitting there and doing so?\n \n Same with pirates. If you make the COST of taking you and your boat more than they desire to pay, this is all that is needed. Why take this boat when we have to decide which one of us dies? (See above conversation) Why don't we pick another boat where the cost/benefit ratio isn't so pricey? I'd much rather try to steal that sailboat over there. They aren't pointing a gun at all of us. Yeah, with that tiny little pistol, we may only lose one or two, but who's it gonna be? You? Me? Right. Let's go for that other boat.\n \n Then, the whole idea becomes a cost/benefit analysis for EVERYONE. When EVERYONE is armed, the cost/benefit analysis gets distributed: \"Is stealing boats in general worth the trouble?\"\n \n As long as it can be done without paying any cost, the answer will be \"Yes.\"\n \n This is the exact same principle at work when I carry my pistol. Anyone trying to accost me should be willing to pay with their life. You gun grabbers cannot even begin to grasp the concept of carrying a firearm. You relentlessly continue to ask stupid, irrellevant questions like, \"Why do you feel the need to compensate for your tiny penises?\" Or \"Don't you know that guns kill 3,908,756 helpless children every minute?\" Or, \"Why do you stupid white republicans live in constant paranoid fear?\"\n \n For some reason, anti-gunners always project their fear onto us. They always assume we're afraid. Why? If they aren't, why do they worry about guns? To me, it seems like the folks who constantly whine and cry about how dangerous we gun owners are are the one's afraid of something. If not, why are they crying about it?\n \n I'm not afraid. Why should I be? If a bunch of pirates attack me in my boat, I can almost guarantee they're going to change their mind. Taking your boat instead is gonna look like a walk in the park. Easy money. Ripe for the picking.\n \n In the constant game of cost/benefit analysis, you're gonna look like the golden goose compared to me. Whether we're on the high seas, or simply walking down the street.\n \n Now why should I be afraid?\n \n Self defense is very similar to the two of us meeting a hungry grizzly bear in the woods. I don't have to outrun the bear. I just have to outrun you.\n \n Same with pirates. I don't have to outgun them. I just have to outgun you.\n \n \nOriginally Posted by sinjin \n You are welcome to carry ordinance in international waters all you like.\n\n \n Yes, but how do you legally get it into international waters? Once there, where do you go? There aren't too many ports where ordinance is allowed. Since I am a law abiding citizen, where, other than international waters, may I legally have a gun?",

However, for this argument to hold water, the \"# of unarmed people taken hostage/# of armed people taken hostage\" ratio has to swing a couple of thousand people in the opposite direction. The only people to have been killed so far....have been unarmed! The only people that have fired weapons at the pirates have been LEFT ALONE. (Of course, these have been cargo ships, and not yachts.

Here is a summary to help avoid eye strain and inability to find a link to the Constitution to support your claims.\n \n \nIn yet another 5-4 decision, the Court in 1997 held unconstitutional a major part of the Brady Act, which sought to impose on local law enforcement officials the burden of conducting background checks for gun purchasers. The ruling in Printz v. United States held that Congress had no power to require state or local governments to enforce a federal regulatory law.\n \n Only powers delegated to the Federal Government Criminal Enforcement:\n The Constitution specifically authorizes federal enforcement of only three types of laws, all of which involve uniquely federal concerns. The first authorized federal criminal law enforcement is based on the Congressional power \"To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States.\" The counterfeiting enforcement power immediately follows the delegation of Congressional power \"To coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin....\" U.S. Const., Art. I, sect. 8. \n The second Congressional criminal power involves the power \"To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and offenses against the law of nations.\" The third is that \"Congress shall have Power to declare Punishment of Treason.\" Although currency, treason, and the high seas clearly involve areas of federal, and not state concern, it is notable that, even in those cases, the authors of the Constitution felt a need specifically to authorize Congressional law enforcement regarding these matters.\n \n In addition to the enumerated federal criminal powers, it is possible to infer some additional power. For example, Congress is given authority to declare uniform rules of bankruptcy; federal law does and should continue to punish bankruptcy fraud, even when perpetrated within a single state. Congressional power over federal property implies the authority to create penalties for destruction of federal property. \n \n While the body of the Constitution grants only narrow criminal law enforcement powers to the federal government, the Bill of Rights, in the Tenth Amendment, specifically reserves to the states all powers not granted to the federal government. - David Kopel\n",

Congress by Constitutional law must provide federal protection to a citizen on the high seas or abroad for both himself and property.\n \n Just like law enforcement on land, they have no duty to any individual but the populace as a whole and by law are duty bound to fulfill their mandate by the Constitution to provide that protection even to ex pats. You must be confused on what orders the Navy operates under and by? That is one felony power delegated to congress to provide whether on land or on the high seas and the proper vehicle for that happens to be the Navy since that is where the piracy occurs.

Old Doc is just spreading the gospel of the Constitutition for any that care to hear with hopes that we don't lose yet another generation to the touchy, feely, changey lure which of late seems to have lost it's luster. The only thing that sets this Republic apart is our written Constitution. A man gotta have something to believe in and I reckon that is about as good as it gets...so sure, the mandate is there in the Constitution if we can wake up the administrator who is supposed to run the show and do his sworn duty and abide by the law. The law is there, it seems the administration went on an extended vacation. I believe all my rights are and should be protected no matter where I am.",

Leaving \"pleasure craft\" to their own fates is not an option in the Constitution. Arming of commercial vessals has already begun. We have been in this fight for our 2A rights for a long time and used taxpayer money to fund some of these nations that signed the treaty to ban guns through the U.N. Our Sec. of State is chomping on the bit to get a chance to sign that treaty also as soon as she gets a chance. Rights are an individual thing and not subject to sale to the highest bidder like 'commercial craft'. There may come a day when the decision is made to send a few MOABs in Mogodishu way as a wake up call. You realize that is a lot of H2O out there the pirates prey upon I suspect? Our Naval vessals getting bombed in harbor near Yemen in the past was treated a a ho-hum deal by that administration. Until everyone demands their rights, first they got to know what they are, none will be forthcoming. Our military men and women are not pawns and should be respected for what they are and do.",

A second thing, there is no provision for police in the Constitution...they were not even provided for and did not exist as such until the latter 1800s. Some States did employ State forces and their own militias and the Rangers were an extension of that force.\n \n I think I already answered your question previously with a comment about the dry land police protection and Naval protection. The Navy covers the entire ocean in it's jurisdiction much unlike police forces which are limited to a very small area. Police enforce codes and ordinances and most often get out of their jurisdiction and in trouble trying to enforce federal laws they don't understand but stick their noses in anyway. Same goes for State laws vs. the local police. They have no Constitutional duty to protect anyone but to the public at large so there is no comparison as cut and dried as you would like to have it. The Navy is the only force provided for in the Constitution and is charged with the duties they perform. Unlike 'standing armies', the provision for a Navy is paramount.",
