No Lurch what I am getting at is sexual harassment, discrimination, etc. Meaning that if anything was violated in such a manner the UCMJ would have it covered....\n \n \n \n \nNo, what I did was make an appropriate analogy. One you didn't address by the way.\n\n \n Yes I did.\n \n \n \nExcept you didn't accuse \"many opponents\", you accused me. I would appreciate it if you didn't do that in the future.\n\n \n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nAgain, if this is the case why do we need separate facilities for men and women? Wouldn't a few guidelines solve the problem?\n \n\n \n Lurch no. First of all women have certain biological needs than men. Secondly, your attempting to bridge this issue into a biological separation of gay and strait men people. \n \n Point being this is not as big an issue as you attempt to make it.\n \n \n \n \nNo, I'm saying that we have separation between men and women for a reason. I see no reason why those same principles wouldn't apply to gay people. These types of issues would need to be dealt with if DADT was repealed.\n\n \n Their being dealt with now. The inquiry led by Admiral Mullen is investigating ways to make the transition and what steps need to be taken.\n \n \n \n \nActually it would be more appropriate to separate gay men from other gay men, much like straight men are separated from straight women. The problem with this solution is logistics.\n\n \n I don't understand your logic. This isn't a prison we're talking about here.... And if your implying there would be rampant gay intercourse your also sadly mistaken. Fraternization is clearly dealt with in the UCMJ...\n \n \nThe military has investigated this before, yet the ban is still there. Also, it is very much up to Obama and Congress. The military cannot lift the ban by itself, a lifting of the ban has to pass Congress and be signed by the President or his veto overridden by Congress. As I said, in my opinion, if the Obama administration wanted to repeal DADT they should have done it last year and if they want to have even a slim chance they better get on it before the mid term elections, because unless something drastic happens the liberals in DC are in for a shellacking come voting time.\n\n \n The military has never done such a thing. Listen to Admiral Mullen stating the reasons as to WHY this needs to be done. There has NEVER been a conclusive study done on DADT or gays in the military for that matter so on that point your wrong.\n \n And also this is not just a Liberal issue here. many blue dog dems want the repeal as do some Republicans. I know that a repeal is feasible and that it must be done.\n \n 17 years of discrimination is long enough in my book.",

   "Sigh..... No Lurch what I am getting at is sexual harassment, discrimination, etc. Meaning that if anything was violated in such a manner the UCMJ would have it covered....\n\n \n Agreed, the UCMJ covers harassment. Yet, even with those rules men and women have separate facilities (bathing, sleeping, etc). If their is a need to separate men from women, because of sexuality, why wouldn't there be a need to separate gay men from other gay men or gay women from other gay women? \n It can be done but its going to pose some serious logistical problems.\n \n \nFirst of all women have certain biological needs than men.\n\n \n Agreed, but thats not why the facilities are separated.\n \n \nSecondly, your attempting to bridge this issue into a biological separation of gay and strait men people.\n\n \n I'm doing no such thing. As I stated, it would be more appropriate to separate gay men from other gay men. Obviously its not a biological difference.\n \n \nTheir being dealt with now. The inquiry led by Admiral Mullen is investigating ways to make the transition and what steps need to be taken.\n\n \n Good to hear. Hopefully they will do an honest cost to benefit analysis of repealing DADT and recommend accordingly. If repealing DADT would make for a better military than I'll be all for it. But, if it is going to be detrimental to the health of the strongest, most cohesive, and best motivated military on earth, than I say no. To me it would be incredibly stupid to weaken our armed forces because some feel excluded.\n \n \nI don't understand your logic. This isn't a prison we're talking about here.... And if your implying there would be rampant gay intercourse your also sadly mistaken. Fraternization is clearly dealt with in the UCMJ...\n\n \n Why do you keep coming back to \"rampant gay intercourse\"? I've never even implied it would happen, yet you keep bringing it up.... interesting. \n Let me lay the logic out for you. Men and women have separate facilities for reasons of sexuality (no, I'm not implying rampant orgies). Even if nothing physical happens there is too much tension, embarassment, uncomfortable feelings, etc. to allow men and women to share facilities like showers, even in places with separate stalls. Logically these same problems would arise if openly gay men shared facilities or if openly gay women shared facilities.\n \n \nThe military has never done such a thing. Listen to Admiral Mullen stating the reasons as to WHY this needs to be done. There has NEVER been a conclusive study done on DADT or gays in the military for that matter so on that point your wrong.\n\n \n Actually the DOD has done studies on gays in the military. I didn't know about them either untill they were shown to me in an earlier thread.\n \n \nAnd also this is not just a Liberal issue here. many blue dog dems want the repeal as do some Republicans. I know that a repeal is feasible and that it must be done.\n 17 years of discrimination is long enough in my book\n\n \n Just so you know I consider most of the blue dog dems liberals along with more than a few republicans.\n The only reason DADT should be repealed is if it is going to improve the military, period. Because some people feel discriminated against is not a good reason and shouldn't even be considered as a factor. I was unable to join the military due to a medical condition, was I discriminated against, yes, was it wrong, no.",

I think personally it's a bunch of over hyped bull to be quite honest.

I don't think any gay person in their right mind would openly attempt to have sex in a shower in this type of facility....\n \n And if they did discharge them. Why should their unruly actions ruin it for the rest of us?\n \n \n \n \nI'm doing no such thing. As I stated, it would be more appropriate to separate gay men from other gay men. Obviously its not a biological difference.\n\n \n We're not sex addicts Lurch, so please stop trying to paint it as some dire need....\n \n \n \n \nGood to hear.

We've already lost 10000 service members over DADT, 800 of which who's jobs were deemed critical to the functionality of our military!!\n \n If it is a better military you want, then repealing DADT is the way to go. Our allies have openly gay people serving and there has been no disasters in their forces from having them serve....\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhy do you keep coming back to \"rampant gay intercourse\"?

So if I provide you with two armed forces members that say otherwise does that make your theory bunk? There are plenty of service men and women, including brass, that think repealing DADT is a bad idea.\n\n \n And there are plenty more who think enforcing DADT is a bad idea..... Mccain supposedly had a document with 1000 retired officers signing to keep DADT in place. Sadly it is not up to them....\n \n It is up to the forces NOW to decide what is to be done..... And another issue to take into consideration is the age of these people.\n \n Later age brackets tend to favor enforcing DADT while younger serving service members favor it's repeal.....\n \n \nAs I said, if someone can show that the benefits of repealing DADT outweight the cost I'm in favor, but repealing it because someone feels disciminated against is stupid. This needs to be evaluated from a standpoint of logistics, monetary costs, unit cohesion, etc., in other words an unbiased cost/ benefit analysis.\n\n \n There really shouldn't need to BE any cost..... Perhaps anti discrimination training, and a revision of the UCMJ I can see.....\n \n \nAsk yourself this: Do you want DADT repealed because you think it makes the military weaker or because you think its unfair?\n\n \n I think both. I think that for one it discriminates, puts members at risk for being discharged even if their sexuality is speculation, and clearly by the number of discharges, and the number of jobs lost due to this policy over the past 17 years it makes the military weaker.\n \n There are many bright talented Gay people serving now and many many more who would serve if the ban was to be lifted.... Excluding a group of people based upon who they are is not only \"unfair\" as you put it, but then limits the military's capability for drawing upon the talent it needs.",
