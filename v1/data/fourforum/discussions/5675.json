   "Schiavo's Parents Dispute Autopsy Report \n Thursday, June 16, 2005\n \n LARGO, Fla. - An autopsy that found Terri Schiavo (search) suffered from severe and irreversible brain-damage has done nothing to sway her parents' position that she deserved to live and may have gotten better with therapy. \n \n The long-awaited report Wednesday found Schiavo's brain had shrunk to about half the normal size for a woman her age when she died March 31 after her feeding tube was disconnected. The autopsy also determined she was blind.\n \n Bob and Mary Schindler (search) disputed the results, insisting their daughter interacted with them and tried to speak. Their attorney said the family plans to discuss the autopsy with other medical experts and may take some unspecified legal action.\n \n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,159733,00.html \n\n \n What don't these people get?
