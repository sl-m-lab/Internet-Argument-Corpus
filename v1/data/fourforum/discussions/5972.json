   "For Congress,from the mid 70's Congress has made laws designed to make it more accesible to the public and given the power from the seniors to every member(ie it democraticized itself),that while done in good faith have worked against the ability of the congress.For example in the 70's,Commitee's chairs power both curtailed and the choosing of those commitee chairs based on internal party elections instead of seniority.The result was the doubling of sub commitees and the empowerment of these sub commitees( the Commitee\n chairs could simply refuse to consider legislation from sub commitees,but the reforming meant any legislation proposed had to be considered).Rules were changed to allow unlimited numbers of new bills and amendments coming from any member,irrelevent on whether or not he/she was part of there commitee.Of course this meant an congress staff increase of 50%.Instead of these new staff being appointed to commitees,they were appointed by members.These reforms,democratic no doubt you say,handed power from the elite and senior in the Congress to the 535 members,these members now been able to put there individual interest's ahead of that of a commitee.The members looked at not working to help the congress work preoperly and act in the best interest's of the American people,but towards getting re-elected etc.\n \n Non members also availed of these reforms,as commitee meetings and recorded votes made open to anyone.Each member would have to vote publicly on every amendment instead of the votes been recorded but not individual member stances.Good idea surely?Not really since the public doesn't give a damn(in general)about who votes what.But interest groups and lobbyists,well funded and organized do.Instead of Congress members that want to do good,you have lobbyists that have mulitplied in number and that have plenty of ammo to aim at the Congress members.Because these lobbyists are powerful and rich,they are necessary for funds and votes for re-election.A classic example,among others,is Cuba where there is a foreign policy that is clearly backwards and pointless but thats in place because powerful anti-Castro Cuban interest groups in Florida are needed to get members of Congress there payday.The Democratization of Congress has left minority rule instead of majority rule.",
