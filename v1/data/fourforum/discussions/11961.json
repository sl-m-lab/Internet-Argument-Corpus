   "Is this really the way to win people over to your cause? I just don't get it. Exactly how does this sort of thing make anyone want to change their views about gays or gay marriage to be more positive and tolerant?\n \n A radical gay rights group is claiming responsibility for a protest Sunday at Mount Hope Church in Delta Township.\n \n Protesters who entered the Creyts Road church along with worshippers surprised the congregation when they stood up during the service, threw fliers at churchgoers and shouted slogans such as \"It's OK to be gay,\" and \"Jesus was a homo,\" according to David Williams, communications director at the church. His father, Dave Williams, is the church's longtime pastor. He was not preaching at the church Sunday.\n \n Another group of protesters demonstrated outside the church at the same time as the indoor protest.\n \n The Eaton County Sheriff's Department responded to the scene Sunday but no arrests were made.\n \n In a released statement, David Williams said churchgoers were unclear as to the purpose of the demonstration.\n \n A Lansing group affiliated with a radical gay organization known as Bash Back, formed to protest the Republican and Democratic national conventions earlier this year, put out a call on the Internet on Oct. 7 for activists to come to a \"radical XXXXX convergence\" in Lansing on Nov. 7-9.\n \n A posting on its MySpace page declared the convergence a \"fierce success.\"\n \n According to a report on the Bash Back group's news site, protesters inside the church pulled a fire alarm, unfurled a banner from the church balcony, shouted and threw fliers to the worshippers.\n \n Outside the church, protesters carried picket signs and an upside-down, pink cross.\n \n The conservative RightMichigan Web site posted an account of the incident Monday, and a number of conservative bloggers had picked up on the item by Tuesday.\n \n Williams said the church had received 80 to 85 e-mails and phone calls by Tuesday, \"from churches and individuals around the country to express their concern and general disgust for what happened on Sunday.\"\n \n Nick De Leeuw of RightMichigan said he got his account of the incident from a church member who was there.\n \n However, he said, the photo along with his report - of protesters dressed in black with their faces covered by pink, Middle-Eastern style headcoverings - was not from the protest at the church but from an earlier Bash Back protest elsewhere.\n \n http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/article/20081112/NEWS01/811120369",

   "Slippery slope FALLACY. NWRT any more other than to point out the fallacy to everyone reading the thread.\n\n \n Prove it! \n \n But here are some disturbing facts regarding the myths surrounding illegal abortions and legal abortions which show a 10 to 12 fold increase since before they were legalized. And this addendum needs to be emphasized. Please note that research on the effects of abortion has been conducted for several decades; yet, much information has been ignored by the media and by public and governmental organizations that should be presenting objective information to the general public. \n Incidence of Induced Abortion in the United States\n Raymond J. Adamek, Ph.D.\n \n How many legal abortions are there in the USA now, and how many induced abortions (legal and illegal) took place prior to the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which permitted abortion for virtually any reason throughout the nine months of pregnancy?\n \n One thing is certain. The number of legal abortions has increased dramatically since legalization, as we see in Table 1.\n \n Table 1.

Christopher Tietze estimates that there were approximately 8000 legal abortions per year in the USA prior to 1967 (see The Effects of Changes in State Abortion Laws, Washington, D.C., U.S. DHEW, 1971, p.4). Figures for 1970-72 are from Tietze et al, Abortion 1974-75, N.Y. Alan Guttmacher Institute, 1976, p.7; 1973-2000 data are from Lawrence B. Finer and Stanley K. Henshaw, \"Abortion Incidence and Services in the United States in 2000,\" Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, 35:1 (Jan/Feb 2003) pp.6-15.\n \n Thus, at a daily rate, the number of legal abortions has increased from 22 per day prior to 1967, to 4407 per day in 1990, and has since decreased to 3,597 per day.\n \n But have not legal abortions simply replaced illegal abortion so that today we have about the same number of induced abortions that we had prior to Roe v. Wade? The answer is most definitely \"No\".\n \n The late C. Tietze (1975:78), an abortion statistics authority, agreed that \"to the extent that unintended births are replaced by legal abortions, the total number of legal and illegal induced abortions increases subsequent to legalization.\"\n \n How great this increase is over the total legal and illegal abortions performed prior to 1968 is difficult to say, since no one can state exactly how many illegal abortions occurred before that. Earlier \"guesstimates\" placed the annual number of illegal abortions at from 200,000 to 1.2 million (U.S. DHEW, 1971). More recent estimates suggest this is much too high.\n \n Tietze (1975) for example, suggested that the illegal abortion maternal death rate in developed countries is 40 per 100,000 cases. In 1966, the last year before the laws began to change, the National Center for Health Statistics reported a total of 189 maternal deaths due to abortions of all types: legal and illegal induced, and spontaneous. [By 1972, the year before Roe v. Wade, it had decreased to 90.]\n \n Even if we were to allow for underreporting of illegal abortion maternal deaths by assuming all of these maternal deaths were due to illegal abortions, the total number of illegal abortions in 1966, at a maximum, would have been 189/40 x 100,000 = 472,500.\n \n Cates and Rochat (1976), utilizing a lower estimate of 30 maternal deaths per 100,000 illegal abortions, state that there were only about 130,000 illegal abortions in 1972, one year before Roe v. Wade, when legal abortion was available only in a few larger cities.\n \n Two surveys asking women about their experience with abortion also indicate that the \"1 million illegal abortions per year\" estimate is much too high. Analyzing the combined results from these polls, Henshaw and Martire (1982) note: \"Most of the abortions obtained by women under age 35 would have occurred after abortion was legalized nationally, while the majority of abortions obtained by women over 35 would have been illegal.\"\n \n Four percent of the older women and 14% of the younger women reported having had abortions, an increase of 350% in abortions after legalization. Allowing for underreporting of illegal abortions, Henshaw and Martire (1982) estimate that 4 million women over age 35 and alive at that time had an illegal abortion. Hence, the \"1 million illegal abortions per year\" claim is much too high, since it would have produced the 4 million figure in just 4 to 6 years, allowing for repeat abortions, and would have resulted in a much higher total than 4 million women.\n \n Finally, the most comprehensive study done suggests that the best estimate of the total number of abortions (legal + illegal) occurring in 1966, before any laws changed, is about 125,000 (McKnight 1992 - 124,342). Since permissive laws began to be passed in 1967, therefore, induced abortions have increased 10 to 12 fold. The idea that prior to Roe v. Wade thousands of women died each year from illegal abortions is a myth.\n \n [Raymond J.

   "Those are a whole another type of issue. It's not the same as homosexual marriages. For instance bestiality is illegal because the animal cannot consent. Therefore there cannot be a legal marriage between the two (not only that it's freakin disgusting..anyways) and pedophelia has nothing to do with marriage or homosexuality for that matter. Evidence suggest most pedophiles are straight white men. Incest depends on the situation, do they both consent or was it rape, etc? Bigamy is also depending on the circumstances. In some instances it is legal to marry someone else if that other person who they are married to is absent from their lives for some time, so again it depends. I also in fact wouldn't have a problem with polygamy or polyandry as long as the people involved are ok with it. This doesn't mean people everywhere are going to do it. It just doesn't happen that way. Also, looking at the \"stats\" on abortion what was the point of it? There is no slippery slope there. That just means population is growing and people no longer have to hide their abortions. I'm sure that 1968 number is a lot higher if you were to include those done illegal because of fear.

   "Those are a whole another type of issue. It's not the same as homosexual marriages. For instance bestiality is illegal because the animal cannot consent. \n\n \n My friend, you are accepting the propaganda without rationally considering the lies the gays tell in order to separate themselves from these other examples, which will most assuredly demand equality for themselves once marriage is redefined for same gender couples. And here's why; Animals don't have human or civil rights to begin with, so their consent wont be needed according to the lawyers who will defend these cases in court. They will show that since animals have no rights, the only victim in this discriminatory act of inequality is the farmer who is being denied the right to legally express his love for this particular animal. \n \n Take every single example of an unnatural union I gave above, and think like a lawyer and it is easy to envision their legal justifications for demanding the exact same version of equality as the gays are desiring. The fact that you haven't seen it before this means that either you chose not to seriously consider the real consequences or you just aren't smart enough to appreciate that it's unavoidable once marriage is redefined for this tiny minority which is attempting to corrupt marriage for all of us.\n \n Here's more real time evidence of the negative impact this redefinition of marriage will have here by simply observing the negative effect it has had on the nuclear family in Northern Europe. Why would americans be so stupid as to want to follow a European schematic for marriage, when we've seen the damage it is doing to these countries family stability?\n The Transatlantic Divide on Marriage: Dutch Data and the U.S. Debate on Same-Sex Unions\n by Patrick F. Fagan, Ph.D. and Grace Smith\n WebMemo #577\n In the debate over the redefinition of marriage, advocates of same-sex marriage have made a variety of arguments. Many have argued that same-sex marriage would be good for homosexuals. Some have gone so far as to propose that the change would strengthen the institutions of marriage and family by reaffirming commitment and fidelity.[1] Early data from abroad, however, do not support the claim that same-sex marriage would benefit marriage in general. In the Netherlands, where homosexual relationships gained legal recognition in 1998, same-sex marriage has not strengthened the family but may have accelerated its decline.\n \n As the Netherlands' experiment in legalizing same-sex unions has illustrated, same-sex marriage in that country constituted one more step in a steady legal and social breakdown of the family. This is not to say that the data imply a causal relationship between the initiation of same-sex marriage and the breakdown of the family in the Netherlands. Rather, the redefinition of marriage furthered a general pattern of cultural and legal erosion of the institution. According to several Dutch social scientists, their fellow citizens \"increasingly regard marriage as no longer relevant\" because they have been persuaded that \"marriage is not connected to parenthood and that marriage and cohabitation are equally valid 'lifestyle choices...'\"[2] Marriage may be losing its place as the fundamental building block of social infrastructure in the Netherlands. As the United States considers how to respond to the judicial dictates redefining marriage,[3] policymakers should be aware of data emerging from the European precedent, and they should choose the most beneficial course for the family in America by preserving the institution of marriage. \n \n The legislative consideration of a marriage amendment to the U.S. Constitution takes place within a much larger debate on the American family and the policies that strengthen or weaken it. In this debate, the United States has been gradually turning in a very different direction from Europe, where recent public policy has facilitated the erosion of the family. Under both the Clinton and Bush administrations the federal policy approach has generally been one of strengthening marriage for the benefit of children. The European strategy presents a stark contrast of granting increased political license to reduce traditional family ties, facilitating greater individualism among adults. The sociological data indicate that the American approach is better for children and for the future strength of nations. \n \n One troubling consequence of these changes in the Netherlands is the growing disconnect between marriage and parenting in the mainstream Dutch consciousness, according to some observers. In the decade leading up to the legalization of same-sex marriage in the Netherlands its proponents made arguments that separated the institution of marriage from parenting.[4] Now, alternative forms of cohabitation and childrearing are increasingly accepted in the reputedly tolerant Netherlands, and marriage has been devalued such that it has become an \"endangered institution.\"[5] All of these developments have done nothing to improve the state of family life in the Netherlands.\n \n A key barometer of the health of the family for any nation is the proportion of children who reach early adulthood in an intact family, and by this measure the Netherlands continues to deteriorate. Not only is an intact family foundational for a child's individual happiness and well-being but also for the social and economic health of the nation's next generation. When parents reject each other in divorce or separation, it dismantles social infrastructure.[6] A steady increase in the percentage of children in the Netherlands living in single-parent families (see Chart 1) was followed by a marked increase in this percentage during the 1990s, when the Dutch population debated and introduced registered partnerships and same-sex marriage. The proportion of the population that is married (see Chart 2) has been steadily decreasing while the proportion of the population that is divorced (see Chart 3) has been steadily rising. In addition, there have been noteworthy increases in\n The percentage of out-of-wedlock births (see Chart 4);\n The number of induced abortions (increases of 31 percent among teenagers, 40 percent among 20- to 24-year-olds, and 36 percent among 25- to 29-year-olds; see Chart 5); and\n The number of couples across all educational levels who choose to remain childless (see Chart 6).\n The campaign for same-sex marriage has also detracted from the significance of marriage by effectively equating other types of relationships with marriage. The Netherlands' creation of \"registered partnerships\" in 1998-in many ways similar to Vermont's civil unions or California's domestic partnerships-touched off a string of significant social changes. A registered partnership, available to heterosexual and homosexual couples alike, is a contractual agreement between two people that provides many of the same benefits as marriage. Following the legalization of same-sex \"marriages\" in 2001, most same-sex registered partners chose to change their relationship status to \"married.\" Simultaneously, the Netherlands witnessed a sizable increase in marriage dissolution among heterosexual couples.\n \n As a result of the Act of Opening Marriage to Same-Sex Couples (2001), a simple legal procedure now allows couples to transform a registered partnership into a marriage, or, vice versa, to change the status of their marriage to a registered partnership. This led further to the phenomenon of \"flash annulments\" or \"lightning divorces\" (flitsscheidingen). In a flash annulment, a couple mutually decides to downgrade their marriage to a registered partnership, which is then quickly followed by the termination of their registered partnership. This effectively circumvents the divorce procedure, which is, by definition, more lengthy and complex. Commentary on flash annulments describes the procedure as an unintended consequence of the legislation.[7]\n \n The number of heterosexual couples who availed themselves of this unforeseen measure was substantial. In 2002-the first full year of its availability-about four thousand married couples terminated their relationships this way.[8] The fact that married couples used this as \"an escape route\" from marriage explains why the majority of registered partnerships (see Chart 7) are between heterosexual couples and why the number of partnerships increased from about four thousand in 1998 to more than eight thousand in 2002.[9] As a result of these legal and social changes marriage is now barely distinguishable in law from registered cohabitation, marriage dissolution through divorce and flash annulments has risen to an historic high (see Chart 8), and the institution of marriage has been further dismantled.\n \n These developments in the Netherlands are undoubtedly part of a larger trend that has been emerging in Europe for years. Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, France, Luxembourg, Hungary, and Iceland have all granted some form of legal recognition to same-sex couples. The Nordic countries continue to pursue policies that erode the intact married family, and much of the continent appears to be following suit toward dismantling traditional marriage. Across the Atlantic, the United States has been struggling towards different goals in the last decade, in the form of the Clinton and Bush administrations' family policies, which include\n An increase in funding for programs promoting sexual abstinence among teens and success in reducing teenage sexual activity;[10]\n A reduction in the number and rate of teenage abortions;[11]\n A drive to stabilize marriage built around a newly forged consensus that married parents remain the ideal for raising children;[12] and\n A renewed commitment to include faith-based services in the country's social welfare strategy.\n In contrast with Europe in general and the Netherlands in particular, the United States is engaged in robust debate about the erosion of the family because of a widespread consensus that the absence of marriage is a threat to children and thus a threat to the future of the nation.[13] The outcome of the national debate on same-sex marriage will either contribute to or detract from the national consensus on the need to strengthen marriage. Congress should play its part by rejecting the Netherlands policy template for the family and the proposition on the part of some advocates that same-sex marriage will strengthen the family in America. It clearly has not in the Netherlands.\n The Transatlantic Divide on Marriage:# Dutch Data and the U.S. Debate on Same-Sex Unions",

   "The article casually thrown out here commits many of the same errors that Kurtz did in an earlier article.\n People throw out all sorts of problems with \"marriage\", and then proclaim that the problems are somehow (but never shown how) caused by gay marriage.\n Despite what Kurtz might say, the apocalypse has not yet arrived. In fact, the numbers show that heterosexual marriage looks pretty healthy in Scandinavia, where same-sex couples have had rights the longest. In Denmark, for example, the marriage rate had been declining for a half-century but turned around in the early 1980s. After the 1989 passage of the registered-partner law, the marriage rate continued to climb; Danish heterosexual marriage rates are now the highest they've been since the early 1970's. And the most recent marriage rates in Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are all higher than the rates for the years before the partner laws were passed. Furthermore, in the 1990s, divorce rates in Scandinavia remained basically unchanged.\n \n Of course, the good news about marriage rates is bad news for Kurtz's sky-is-falling argument. So, Kurtz instead focuses on the increasing tendency in Europe for couples to have children out of wedlock. Gay marriage, he argues, is a wedge that is prying marriage and parenthood apart.\n \n The main evidence Kurtz points to is the increase in cohabitation rates among unmarried heterosexual couples and the increase in births to unmarried mothers. Roughly half of all children in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark are now born to unmarried parents. In Denmark, the number of cohabiting couples with children rose by 25 percent in the 1990s. From these statistics Kurtz concludes that \" ... married parenthood has become a minority phenomenon,\" and-surprise-he blames gay marriage.\n \n But Kurtz's interpretation of the statistics is incorrect. Parenthood within marriage is still the norm-most cohabitating couples marry after they start having children. In Sweden, for instance, 70 percent of cohabiters wed after their first child is born. Indeed, in Scandinavia the majority of families with children are headed by married parents. In Denmark and Norway, roughly four out of five couples with children were married in 2003. In the Netherlands, a bit south of Scandinavia, 90 percent of heterosexual couples with kids are married.\n \n Kurtz is also mistaken in maintaining that gay unions are to blame for changes in heterosexual marriage patterns. In truth, the shift occurred in the opposite direction: Changes in heterosexual marriage made the recognition of gay couples more likely. In my own recent study conducted in the Netherlands, I found that the nine countries with partnership laws had higher rates of unmarried cohabitation than other European and North American countries before passage of the partner-registration laws. In other words, high cohabitation rates came first, gay partnership laws followed.\n \n A subtler version of Kurtz's argument states that the advent of registered partnership caused an increase in cohabitation rates and children born outside of marriage (nonmarital births). If that were true, then we would expect to see two patterns: Cohabitation rates and the nonmarital birth rate would rise more quickly within a country after it passed partner registration laws; and the rise in the nonmarital birth rate would be greater in countries that had such laws than in countries that do not recognize same-sex partnerships.\n \n Kurtz's argument fails both tests. From 1970 to 1980, the Danish nonmarital birth rate tripled, from 11 percent to 33 percent. Over the next 10 years, it rose again to 46 percent and then stopped rising in 1990s after the passage of the 1989 partnership law. Norway's big surge occurred in the 1980's, with an increase from 16 percent to 39 percent. In the decade after Norway recognized same-sex couples (in 1993), the nonmarital birth rate first rose slightly, then, after a couple of years, leveled off at 50 percent.\n \n Cohabitation rates tell a similar story. In Denmark, from 1980 to 1989, the number of unmarried, cohabiting couples with children rose by 70 percent, but the same figure rose by only 28 percent from 1989 to 2000-the decade after Denmark introduced its partner-registration laws-and then stopped rising. From 2000 to 2004, the number has increased by a barely perceptible 0.3 percent. The fact that rates of cohabitation and nonmarital births either slowed down or completely stopped rising after the passage of partnership laws shows that the laws had no effect on heterosexual behavior.\n \n Furthermore, the change in nonmarital births was exactly the same in countries with partnership laws as it was in countries without. The eight countries that recognized registered partners at some point in the decade from 1989 to 2000 saw an increase in the average nonmarital birth rate from 36 percent in 1991 to 44 percent in 2000, an eight percentage point increase. Among the EU countries that didn't recognize partners (plus Switzerland), the average rate of nonmarital births rose from 15 percent to 23 percent-also an eight-point increase.\n \n No matter how you slice the demographic data, rates of nonmarital births and cohabitation do not increase as a result of the passage of laws that give same-sex partners the right to registered partnership. To put it simply: Giving gay couples rights does not inexplicably cause heterosexuals to flee marriage, as Kurtz would have us believe. Looking at the long-term statistical trends, it seems clear that the changes in heterosexuals' marriage and parenting decisions would have occurred anyway, even in the absence of gay marriage.\n \n And all the conservative hand-wringing seems especially unnecessary when you consider the various incentives that encourage American heterosexual couples to marry. By marrying, U.S. couples obtain health-insurance coverage, pensions, and Social Security survivor benefits. Plus, in the United States we are required by law to be financially responsible for our spouses in bad times, since we don't have Scandinavian-style welfare programs to fall back on.\n \n In addition, American society already wrestles with the social tensions that Kurtz claims have occurred as a result of gay marriage in Scandinavia: deepening divisions over gay issues in churches, the increasing acceptance of lesbian and gay relationships in the media, and the occasional radical voice arguing for the abolition of marriage. Yet heterosexual couples keep getting married-more than 2 million of them every year.\n \n Concerns about the impact of gay marriage on heterosexual behavior are not unique to the United States, of course. European countries that recognize same-sex couples initially had their worriers, too. Over time, however, it became clear that civilization and family life would survive the recognition of gay couples' rights. Even the conservative governments that came into power have not tried to repeal rights for gay couples in France and the Netherlands.\n \n Both demographic data and common sense show that the dire predictions of Dobson and Kurtz are just cultural prenuptial jitters. Now that gay and lesbian couples are marrying in Massachusetts, we'll have a home-grown social experiment that will undoubtedly compare to that of Europe: Letting gay couples say \"I do\" does not lead to heterosexuals saying \"I don't.\"Did gay marriage destroy marriage in Scandinavia? - By M.V.

It talks of how accomodations such as registered partnerships, have perhaps taken away some of the special meaning of marriage. That's what I have been saying all along. Equal marriage for same sex couples, is not the threat. However, when employing every means to avoid giving equal recognition under marriage, it's the setting up of parallel, separate but equal systems which focus on providing needed benefits, and must also be made accessible to heterosexual couples; these may potentially harm marriage's special place in society. Couples gay and straight will ask, why bother getting married? It was the earlier efforts to maintain marriage discrimination that your article speaks to, and suggests may have caused problems. \n \n Just before equal marriage for same-sex couples was granted in Canada, the courts ruled against equality of key benefits for co-habitating couples.

And we aren't curtailing any right to marry that you ever had either.

Let's look at eHarmony, your most recent attack. \n \n This dating service was founded by a christian and for straight christians in order to create a safe place for believers to meet each other. But one gay guy didn't like being excluded, in spite of the fact that there are thousands of gay dating services in America so he sued, and rather than going broke challenging this suit, eHarmony must now create a separate division in order to service homosexuals.\n \n In what kind of world do we live in that tells a private company how they must run their business? How is that fair or right? I'm seriously considering contacting a dozen of these gay dating services and demanding that they service my hetero needs and cost them the investment needed to build on such a sevice.

How discriminatory is that? \n \n And why isn't every single gay dating service listed on Google, all 990,000 of them required to also serve a straight clientele also? If it works one way, then surely the reverse should work also. You seem to think it's justified to force a private business owner to cater to a demographic which he never set out to serve, but will you support the requirement that all gay dating services must also serve straights? If not then you are what I have always said you are; a bigoted hypocrite who can't stand the thought of allowing straights to do anything which doesn't involve your community, while your community expects to have your isolation when it serves you. AGAIN, we must be tolerant of you while you show no tolerance at all.\n \n Just for the heck of it I googled GAY CHRISTIAN DATING SERVICES to see if this jerk had a valid point since they are hard to find. And lo and behold, 802,000 of them spring up. gay christian dating services - Google Search\n \n So there was no discrimination here at all. There was no service he didn't have ready access to within his own community. This was just more of the homosexual agenda to target another straight organization and force acceptance under the guise of either equality or discrimination in order to further your goal of infiltrating every aspect of our world.",

Or White to White, and everybody else can do what they want?\n \n How about if a restaurant refused to seat blacks and whites at the same table. If an interracial couple came in, they would have to sit in different sections.\n \n It's discrimination Archie.\n We're not talking about a MENU item here. We're talking about PEOPLE who ARE CUSTOMERS.\n \n \n \nAnd why isn't every single gay dating service listed on Google, all 990,000 of them required to also serve a straight clientele also?\n\n 1) Quite frankly, by this ruling if a \"gay only\" service existed, it needs to serve both gay and straight.\n A straight person COULD EASILY take the gay service to court and demand such a change, with this case as an applicable precedent.\n 2) If you seriously think there are 990,000 gay dating services out there, then you REALLY NEED TO LOOK at those links that come up in google.\n Here's some of those links:\n Michelle Malkin eHarmony forced to offer same-sex dating services; Update: And now, a class-action lawsuit\n So I guess Michelle Malkin is doing gay dating now, eh?\n Private Company Forced to Offer Gay Dating Service (Mexican, campaign, legal) - Politics and Other Controversies - City-Data Forum\n eHarmony to Provide Gay Dating Service After Lawsuit\n Suit forces eHarmony to offer gay dating service :: WRAL.com\n \n The vast majority of those links are NOT to \"gay dating services\".\n Google includes news articles, web forums talking about \"gay dating services\", and other junk in their search replies.\n \n \n \nYou seem to think it's justified to force a private business owner to cater to a demographic which he never set out to serve, but will you support the requirement that all gay dating services must also serve straights?\n\n 1) You mean demographics like blacks, or Jews, or women?\n As difficult as it may be for you to accept, our country has a LONG HISTORY of forcing \"private businesses\" to include demographics that the owner is prejudiced against.\n \n 2) I never said what my position on this story is.\n I simply explained to you what \"discrimination\" was existing.\n \n \n \nJust for the heck of it I googled GAY CHRISTIAN DATING SERVICES to see if this jerk had a valid point since they are hard to find. And lo and behold, 802,000 of them spring up. gay christian dating services - Google Search\n So there was no discrimination here at all.\n\n That's a false assumption.\n 1) People like you need to STOP defining the word \"discrimination\" based on whether or not you ACCEPT the \"act\" that is being questioned as \"discriminatory\" or not.\n It IS discrimination for \"Christian (only) dating services\".\n Whether it is LEGAL discrimination is an entirely different question.\n \n It IS possible to have discrimination that is LEGAL in our society.\n The Boy Scouts discriminate against girls, gays, and atheists.\n But it's legal.\n \n 2) Just because nobody has sued those other organizations doesn't mean that it's legal.\n The 14th amendment was the cornerstone of Loving v Virginia.\n The 14th amendment was passed ONE HUNDRED YEARS before Loving v Virginia.\n Lawsuits take time for a variety of reasons. Injustices and unconstitutionalities can exist for decades before they are addressed.\n \n \n \nThere was no service he didn't have ready access to within his own community.\n\n And we're back to the \"separate drinking fountains\" approach.\n After all, that provides a \"service\" that the preson has \"ready access\" to, doesn't it?\n \n The existence of alternative options DOES NOT address the justifiableness of discrimination.\n If one \"whites only\" bakery was surrounded by TWO HUNDRED \"whites and blacks\" bakeries, it wouldn't make the \"white only\" bakery legal.\n \n \n \nThis was just more of the homosexual agenda to target another straight organization and force acceptance under the guise of either equality or discrimination in order to further your goal of infiltrating every aspect of our world.\n\n Just because an organization serves both gays and straights doesn't mean squat about \"acceptance\".\n In my partner's line of works, he has served all kinds of people he doesn't accept.\n Some people need to realize that not discriminating does not mean \"acceptance\".",

   "Your question is bogus from the outset as you phrase it in a bigoted and hateful way.\n\n \n It is true that I disapprove of Christianity because as a religion, or as a church, it is generally bigoted against gay people. There are a few, a pitiful few Christian exceptions. Of course, I do not believe that you are a typical Christian. Your version is particularly bigoted against gays, others are less so.\n \n \nChristians oppose homosexuality on moral grounds, not on grounds of bigotry against homosexuals.\n\n \n This is a distinction without a difference. One might as well say that one opposes dark skin on moral grounds without being bigoted against dark-skinned people. Black people can't help being black; I can't help being gay. \n \n \nAnd we aren't curtailing any right to marry that you ever had either.\n\n \n Here you justify bigotry because Christians have always been bigoted, so apparently they needn't change.\n \n \nBecause marriage has historically always had limitations attached to it for many other lifestyles as well, and none of them are claiming they are being treated unequally. This is your claim for victim status in order to guilt the larger society into submitting to your demand for special rights. \n\n \n Sorry sweetie, but you are the only one claiming special rights. You claim the special right that your religion become part of the law to enact your bigotry against those who do not share your squalid religious beliefs.\n \n \nHomosexuals attack any christian institution they come across which doesn't include homosexuals.\n\n \n Sorry, but this rant is unjustified. Your religion's bigotry is constitutionally protected. It's your evil attempt to make your religion a theocratic one that is being opposed.",
