   "Over in the Creationism/Evolution forum, marc9000's multiple ramblings brought us to \"traditional morals.\" When I challenged whether \"traditional morals\" are \"actually moral,\" he responded with\n \nWho is the ultimate authority on \"actual morality\"? It's a worldview - not the same as absolute truth.\n(Source)\n \n I responded,\n \nThe question is not who is the ultimate authority, but how moral are \"traditional morals.\" That is to say, don't you support the death penalty for people who work on the sabbath and a father's right to sell his daughter into slavery? But I'll let you off the hook here, as this specific topic is really out of place in this forum.\n\n \n To which he predictably replied,\n \nWith no ultimate (earthly) authority, it can't be determined how moral they are!\n\n \n Accordingly, I said,\n \nSo you need some invisible man in the sky to tell you that murder is wrong?! That is, if the invisible man told you that murder was perfectly acceptable, you'd be okay with it, and probably do it?\n And you think your system of ethics is superior, eh?\n Now is my turn to make the threat: you dare respond to this point with even the slightest substance, and I make a new thread in the appropriate forum. I can only hope you'll respond.\n\n \n And I was lucky enough for him to bite:\n \nIt makes a difference if he tells me I'm accountable for it. Murder happens all the time - who that commits it thinks he will be accountable for it after this life? Almost no one. \n \n Well this is your lucky day!!!!!!! The Bible is in two divisions, LAW and GOSPEL. Those who know something about the Bible know how to blend them and apply them, to distinguish between history, the personality of God, the evil of satan, and guidelines for living. Start that thread.\n\n \n So here we are.\n \n As best as I can tell, marc thinks it's immoral to kill because he'll be held accountable for it. In other words, if he thought there were no personal consequences, he wouldn't be opposed to murder.\n Worse, what this means is that if the invisible man in the sky told marc that he should murder, he would.\n \n I now challenge marc to explain both (1) why this invisible man is the ultimate authority on morality, and (2) why he thinks his system of morality is more \"actually moral\" than other systems (like, for example, Dan Barker's explanation of humanism).\n \n I would also like him to clearly answer these questions:\n (a) If the invisible man in the sky did indeed ask you to murder without personal consequences, would you?\n (b) From where does the invisible man get his morals?",

I disagree entirely. I can't understand why he wants to leave us defenseless like that.\" \n \n On the Internet, it is common to exaggerate the opponent's position so that a comparison can be made between the opponent and Hitler. \n\n \n http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html#straw\n \n A wannabe murderer could be close to Hitler.

(Or anyway, no snappy answer that the audience has the background to understand.) Your opponent has a choice: he can look weak or he can look long-winded. For example, \"How can scientists expect us to believe that anything as complex as a single living cell could have arisen as a result of random natural processes?\" \n \n Actually, pretty well any question has this effect to some extent. It usually takes longer to answer a question than ask it. \n \n Variants are the rhetorical question, and the loaded question, such as \"Have you stopped beating your wife?\" \n\n \n http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html#question\n \n You're trying to make me look \"weak\" or \"long winded\", and either way I suspect you have an arsenal of detailed atheist copy/pastes waiting to plug into anything I say.\n \n \n \n \nI would also like him to clearly answer these questions:\n (a) If the invisible man in the sky did indeed ask you to murder without personal consequences, would you?\n (b) From where does the invisible man get his morals?\n\n \n RHETORICAL QUESTION\n \n \nArgument by Rhetorical Question: \n asking a question in a way that leads to a particular answer. For example, \"When are we going to give the old folks of this country the pension they deserve?\" The speaker is leading the audience to the answer \"Right now.\" Alternatively, he could have said \"When will we be able to afford a major increase in old age pensions?\" In that case, the answer he is aiming at is almost certainly not \"Right now.\" \n\n \n http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html#question\n \n This one leads to only two particular answers, either I disobey God, or I am a murderer. Actually, it seems the \"argument by question\" and \"argument by rhetorical question\" could be interchangable between your two questions. \n \n Your opening post simply contains too many of your beloved fallacies for me to debate this.\n \n You're seeking revenge due to our previous discussions, and you're so blind with rage that you're not watching what you're doing. \n \n I'm going to leave you alone now.",

   "STRAWMAN.\n \n A wannabe murderer could be close to Hitler. No bigger strawman has ever been built on these forums.\n\n When did I say anything about Hitler?\n If I have misrepresented your position, you are welcome to explain how I have done so and to correct me. That is, if it is not the case that \"if the invisible man in the sky tells marc9000 to murder, then marc9000 would murder,\" you should explain both so and why.\n \n \nARGUMENT BY QUESTION.\n \n You're trying to make me look \"weak\" or \"long winded\", and either way I suspect you have an arsenal of detailed atheist copy/pastes waiting to plug into anything I say.\n\n \"Argument by question\" is not a recognized logical fallacy, to my knowledge. In fact a Google search turns up a mere 23 hits for the term, the vast majority of them being either Don Lindsay's mention or the three words used in a different context.\n While it may be a backhanded tactic to ask a complicated question when an appropriately lengthy answer is required in a format with limited time or space, marc has as much space as he cares to use in order to answer these questions. One can tell by my posts that I have no fear of \"looking 'long-winded'\" merely because my posts are long. In fact, they are long because they are substantive and explanatory, not mere handwaving.\n \n \nRHETORICAL QUESTION\n \n This one leads to only two particular answers, either I disobey God, or I am a murderer. Actually, it seems the \"argument by question\" and \"argument by rhetorical question\" could be interchangable between your two questions.\n\n Once again, a Google search for this \"fallacy\" turns up a mere 17 hits. (Contrastly, searches for the true logical fallacy of \"strawman fallacy\" and \"straw man fallacy\" turn up well over 500,000.\n \n marc can substantively respond to these questions because I am not demanding simple answers. For example, instead of responding either \"yes\" or \"no\" to the question, \"Have you stopped beating your wife?\", one can reply, \"I have never beaten my wife.\" marc has every opportunity to do so.\n \n \nYour opening post simply contains too many of your beloved fallacies for me to debate this.\n\n Funny, earlier you insisted that pointing out fallacies has no place in debate... Now you're pointing out bogus and inapplicable ones?\n \n \nYou're seeking revenge due to our previous discussions, and you're so blind with rage that you're not watching what you're doing. I'm going to leave you alone now.\n\n Why would I be seeking revenge? You've been on the ropes the entire time. That's quite a turnaround from yesterday, when you heartily encouraged me to start this thread!:\n \nWell this is your lucky day!!!!!!! The Bible is in two divisions, LAW and GOSPEL. Those who know something about the Bible know how to blend them and apply them, to distinguish between history, the personality of God, the evil of satan, and guidelines for living. Start that thread. [emphases added]\n\n What a shame.\n \n Or maybe this is all too complex for you? What if I simplify things? I'll ask you to answer only a single question that is purely substantive and applicable to Divine Command theory:\n From where does the invisible man get his morals?",

It seems to me that you're not objecting to having your asses handed to you, but rather not having them handed to you on a silver platter by your personal butler. I fail to see why that's such a travesty. I personally think that people should not hold such ludicrous positions that they have their asses handed to them at all.\n \n \nAll you are doing is exposing your adolescence.\n\n What is unfair about this debate? Can you explain why questions 1, 2, a, or b are unfair? He gave the impetus, I made the challenge, and he accepted. Hell, he invited. So here's this thread, and marc stepped in to accuse me of charlatanism instead of addressing the points, then tucked tail and ran. There is nothing wrong with asking the questions I asked except that marc can't answer them, which is to say that there is nothing wrong with asking them at all.\n \n My arguments don't rest on dishonesty. I provide evidence for a claim whenever my claim is questioned. Despite being repeatedly called a liar and a dishonest hack on this forum, nobody has ever met my challenge of showing me where I have lied. I've had a submission directed toward me that was so abusive that it contained five rule violations in one sentence. marc calls scientists and atheists frauds with alarming regularity and ignores 90% of my statements (as shown in this thread). He lies, accuses me of needing clones to defeat him, and runs away from challenges he accepts. And let's not even start on Archangel. So why, pray tell, are you ripping into me about \"adolescence?\" Surely you don't think that marc and Archie's behavior are representative of mature debate...",

In fact, to object to one saying \"yes\" to the first question really implies a moral absolute elsewhere that suggests murder is always wrong and God doesn't really exist. So the question comes where is that moral absolute.\n\n \n It's pretty simple. Morals are the prinicples people need to get along together in a society. Our natural instinct is to look out for ourselves, and maybe close relatives. We need some externally applied code to guide us if we're going to have large groups of strangers living together without constant aggresion. To use your example, if everyone decided murder was ok, the society those people lived in would collapse and that \"moral code\" would disappear. It's sort of a process of natural selection for morals. Codes that don't work lead to dead-end societies, codes that work allow their societies to prosper. And if you look at the moral codes that have worked and survived, I think you'll see that they boil down to the basic idea that helping others is good and hurting them is bad. Simple in principle, sometimes hard in application. I don't know if \"absolute\" is the correct term for it, it's simply the moral code that has worked best.",
