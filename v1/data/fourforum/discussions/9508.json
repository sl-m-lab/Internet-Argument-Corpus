Trapped in a wrold thats not your own, smiling faces seem to vanish, and the tides of time rushes in. A heart once broken is mended, and tears that once brush a face, have been forgotten. In time, everything fades, pains that used to peirce, have lost their feeling. And laughter once heard, has faded away. All that is left is the memories one posses, and the feelings they envoke. Hold on the the things you love, never let them die, because with time you may forget them. Everything fades, only to leave, a whisper of what was once there.",
