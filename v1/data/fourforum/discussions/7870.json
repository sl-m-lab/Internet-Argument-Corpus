   "Are western democracies in the know how democracy works in the Ukraine?\n The criminal regime of Yuschenko just eliminates those not taking their side. They kill journalists who let out the truth about their crimes and corruption. The killers of journalist Gongadze haven't been detained and they will never be I guess. \n It's getting worse! Political opponents are now physically intimidated and eliminated.\n The just elected mayor A. Simonenko in the Crimea location of Myirny was beaten up to death by his political opponents. \n We are most indignated by the fact authorities call this just 'pure hooliganism'.\n Attacks against political opponents are becoming common practice in the 'democratic Ukraine'. \n International watchdogs must probe into!\n Electors, Myirny, Crimea.",
