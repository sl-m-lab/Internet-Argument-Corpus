I know people might say Israel also comitts acts of violence, but one side has to make the first step.\n Any way it doesn't get any where for the Arabs. Israel is to powerfull and has a very modern and strong army. A different approach is required by Arabic countries in the Middle East. Just because you accept Israels right to exist does not mean that you agree with the her size or the ocupation of Lebanese and Syrian land. The acceptance of Israel and an end to violence acts against her is only the first step in achieving peace in the Middle East.emoticon_xkill emoticon_xkill emoticon_xkill\n \n Merlin",

Since they are ilegally occupying that land anyway, this is not an unreasonably request. Several nations have pledged troops to patrol the border if htey will do so.\n \n So, you are right, somebody has to take the first step, and it pretty much has to be israel. None of this BS where they withdraw after building a huge wall that annexes territory and walls off all the water in the region. They have to simply withdraw to their original borders, and then they can get somewhere. As long as they are illegally occupying land and killing people, they really cannot expect to get anywhere.",

   "I believe it is the Palestinians that should make the first move. At present the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Eastern Jerusalem are technically belonging to no country. This being the case the Palestinian authority should be able to make their own decalration of independance for the land and claim it has Palestine. All of the above land is contained within the 1967 demarcation green line that was supposed be the basis of a Palestinian state within the Middle East. There is no point them waiting for the world to act they need to go this first step alone. This would completly change the goalposts of the conflict between Jews and Arabs. Has long as the Palestinian authority met the international conditons laid out for a state to be formed and it was accepted by the world then the state of Palestinian would be formed from that point with all the land contained within the 1967 green line. From this they could build & develop the infra structure of their state and the question of free movement of citezens within a state would have to be addressed by the UN. This is no small matter has it is one of the UN's own charter that free movement within a state should be allowed to occur. The key word is VIABILITY of a Palestinian state that is important. The West Bank and Gaza Strip are seperated by Israel and such make it hard to achieve this when in two parts. The UN violated one of its own charters when partitioning the land both in 1947 and 1967 so not only would the Plaestinians have Israel in a difficult legal posistion but also the UN.\n This was the whole basis of my thread.

Putting Israel right there is as stupid as sitting the KKK down in the heart of south central LA and arming them with bazookas, grenade launchers, and MP5s.

It was a mistake for it to happen in the first place and when it was done it was all done wrong. There was no concern for the indigenous population of Palestinians who had been on the land for over a thousand years. To be honest I think Israel is worse than the Arabic terorists in the acts of death and terror they comit against the Palestinians. My thread was saying that any violence that the Palestinians carry out towards Israel whether in self defense or not is playing into the hands of their enemy. The land agreements in 1947 and 1967 violated the UN's own charter and so because of this in my opinion are null and void. The Palestinians have to rise above the acts of violence comitted against them by the IDF and declare their own state. Then viability of that state would have to be dealt with by the International comunity. I have sent this to the academics against Israel to see if legally the UN did break its own charter in 1967 to find out for sure. The charter I am talking about is the UN's decalration on Human Rights in article 13 \"Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state\" and \"Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and return to his country\".\n \n What other option do the Palestinians have when their enemy is so much more militarily stronger than they are. Either way the Palestinians win with this option. If the UN 1967 land partition is found to be ilegal then it would have to start from the begining and a new equal distribution of the 26,990sq km of land would have to occur.

   "What this debate is actually about, is Islam vs. Judaism. Now, the question stands, well who is right? The answer is neutral, neither is correct. \n \n However, this does not mean to say that we cannot come up with a respectable answer. \n \n Many of you are debating, who should stop agression first? Truth is, neither side will cease to fight. This is an ongoing problem, which I believe it will never be resolved until one side is declared victorious. \n \n Ever since the founding of Islam, or the real separation of Islam in 632 C.E. after Muhammed's death, there has been major conflict between the Jews and Muslims. This problem isn't something that can be wiped out over night. The problems have been so ingrained into the minds of these religions, that neither can get along, or agree with one another. \n \n What I will say, which may put new light on this, is that the U.N. backs Israel, not Palestine. Why is this? Is it not safer to back Palestine? \n \n There are roughly 6 million people who live in Israel, and over one billion Muslims in the surrounding areas. Wouldn't it make sense to be done with Israel, and liberate Palestine? After all, I believe that the U.S. (Israel's most favoured ally), is only Israel's ally because of nuclear threat. What happens when Palestine too has nuclear capabality? Do we just switch sides? \n \n If we had not been succeptable to Israel in the first place, whether it was out of sympathy of the holocaust, what ever reason, we must not let this blind us of the correct path. \n \n If it were my choice, I would side with Palestine once and for all. I would, ultimately, completely rid the Middle East of U.N troops, and let them keep themselves to themselves. This will not only rid us of the problem, but it will keep 1.6 billion Muslims happy, and I think you will find that international terrorism, in America, and in Europe, will become almost non-existent. \n \n Shaykh Usama bin Ladin calls for only 6 quotas to be met. The main things he calls for in this quota is the liberation of Palestine, a cease of agreement with Israel and ultimately, to completely rid ourselves of the Middle East. \n \n So, there are many aspects of which this argument can be seen. This is just what I notice, and hopefully there is now much more to discuss!\n \n Thanks for reading,\n \n Tim",
