   "Since this is the education forum, I will address education specifically.\n \n My opinion is that we are trying so hard to develop the full potential of everyone, that we are dragging everyone down a few pegs. It's seen in the language that we use: look at \"No Child Left Behind\". \n \n When I went to school, the retarded kids or those who were otherwise slow either did not go to school, or were kept segregated in \"special education\" classes. The idea was, the kids who can learn and function at a high level were taught at a high level. Those who could not keep up were educated at a level they could handle. Let's face it, not every child out there has the potential to be a doctor or a lawyer or a rocket scientist. But it seems that now we try to treat every child as if they have this potential. We put the slow kids in the same classes that the higher functioning kids are in, and in turn drag the higher functioning kids down a little bit. If you have to \"dumb it down\" so everyone can keep up, we are not educating the higher functioning kids at the level that they are capable of. Decreased efficiency in the classroom is leading to a decreased level of education for our society as a whole. \n \n I have spoken with several friends who I went to school with who are now teachers in the same schools that we went to back in the day. Most express frustration that they are forced to teach subjects at a markedly slower pace, and must continuously review and play catch-up with certain kids. Most will tell me that these are the kids that used to be in the \"special classes\". \n \n I think it has a bit to do with the fact that we have become so PC that we are afraid to call a spade a spade. A slow kid is a slow kid. They will never be able to keep up with the majority. I'm all for providing education to everyone, but there are limitations to what you can do with some people. Should we be trying to turn all of our children into college material? No. Too Idealistic. Sounds good on paper, but it does not work in reality. Some kids were meant to re-tread tires, or make Big Macs, or pick up garbage. If that is the limit of their potential and they make it to that limit, then great for them. The world needs garbage collectors as much as it needs cardiothoracic surgeons. The only true waste is any child who does not strive to reach his full potential...whatever that may be. \n \n It's simple triage folks, something I do in my job a lot. For those who do not know, 'triage' means: to sort. You have a limited amount of resources, and more patients (or students) than you can realistically help. You can attempt to save everyone, and in turn take attention away from the ones that need help the most and will most likely benefit the most from such attention. Or, you can realize that you cannot save everyone, and focus your resources towards those who are most likely to benefit from those resources.",

I'm sure it requires great levels or management, organization, patience, and dedication. I'm sure that I could not go into a class and teach calculus...as I don't know the first thing about it. However, none of this has anything to do with my point.\n \n You are saying that I should not be able to voice my opinion about the educational system because I am not a teacher. I should not dare to stick my nose in and make observations that are plain to see. That I'm not a public school teacher, therefore it would be impossible for me to have a grasp on the difficulties and problems facing education today. That by pointing out flaws in the educational system, that I am attempting to set my self up as an equal to teachers. Well, you're wrong about a few things. \n \n 1. It does not require a teacher to realize that education in this country is falling behind. Students can tell you that. Anyone with average powers of observation and reading comprehension can tell you that. You need to get over the notion that teachers are the only people who understand how education works.\n \n 2. It does not require a teacher to identify root causes of the problems in our educational system. A little analysis of information and critical thinking can go a long way...even for those without teaching certificates.\n \n 3. Teachers are not the only ones capable of fixing our educational system. I contend that if teachers were the root cause of our problems, then yes...we could put it on them to fix it. If teachers were the only ones capable of fixing education in this country, I would say that they are doing a woefully poor job of addressing problems. IMO, the majority of problems in our educational system today are related to political legislation and general shifts in societal values and attitudes. We probably never will be able to change societies overall views, so we should effect change where it is needed...at the government level. (Of course, since I am not a politician, I have no idea how government and politics work, I have no right to identify problems imposed by our political system, and have no right to voice my opinion about such problems...right?) emoticon_rolleyes I sincerely hope you don't vote. ;) \n \n 4. Making observations about problems and suggesting solutions is NOT setting oneself up as an expert on education. I would go as far as to say that not many teachers are experts in education. They may be experts in their specific subject matter, but that does not make them experts in education. Being a pilot does not make me an expert on the entire field of aviation. Being a paramedic does not make me an expert in emergency services.",

   "You're also pretty ignorant, Gamehuis, if you think that people thought the earth was flat before Columbus. It had been known for centuries that the world was round, it's just that no-one trusted Columbus' claims of the size of it and the distance required to reach India.\n\n You're right, but that's not the point. The point is that Columbus questioned conventional thinking and the status quo and as such did great things.\n \n People should always question everything (especially authority) and never take anything at their face value.\n If people really did that, then we wouldn't have the war in Iraq for example or our continued loss of our civil liberties.",

Almost everyone, going back 3000 years, has thought that the current generation of young people is lazier, stupider, more badly behaved and more ignorant than their own. Recent evidence in the UK is that standards in maths are gradually improving, while standards in English have remained fairly constant.
