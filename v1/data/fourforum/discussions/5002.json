   "Looks like curtains for native Europeans.\n =========================\n EUROPE:\n Eurabia?\n \n Niall Ferguson\n \n Niall Ferguson examines the impact of Europe's growing Muslim population on a continent that otherwise faces low birthrates and aging populations.\n \n Niall Ferguson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and a professor of international history at Harvard University. \n \n In the 52nd chapter of his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon posed one of the great counterfactual questions of history: If the French had failed to defeat an invading Muslim army at the Battle of Poitiers in AD 732, would all of Western Europe have succumbed to Islam?\n \n \"Perhaps,\" speculated Gibbon with his inimitable irony, \"the interpretation of the Koran would now be taught in the schools of Oxford, and her pulpits might demonstrate to a circumcised people the sanctity and truth of the revelation of Mahomet.\"\n \n When those words were published in 1788, the idea of a Muslim Oxford could scarcely have seemed more fanciful. The last Muslim forces had been driven from Spain in 1492; the Ottoman advance through Eastern Europe had been decisively halted at the gates of Vienna in 1683.\n \n Today, however, the idea seems somewhat less risible. The French historian Alain Besancon is one of a number of European intellectuals who detect a significant threat to the continent's traditional Christian culture. The Egyptian-born writer Bat Yeor has for some years referred to the rise of a new \"Eurabia\" that is hostile in equal measure to the United States and Israel. Two years ago, Pat Buchanan published an apocalyptic book, titled The Death of the West, prophesying that declining European fertility and immigration from Muslim countries could turn \"the cradle of Western civilization\" into \"its grave.\"...\n \n (Snip)\n \n To begin with, consider the extraordinary prospect of European demographic decline. A hundred years ago-when Europe's surplus population was still crossing the oceans to populate America and Australasia-the countries that make up today's European Union accounted for around 14 percent of the world's population. Today that figure is down to around 6 percent, and by 2050, according to a United Nations forecast, it will be just over 4 percent. The decline is absolute as well as relative. Even allowing for immigration, the United Nations projects that the population of the current European Union members will fall by around 7.5 million over the next 45 years. There has not been such a sustained reduction in the European population since the Black Death of the fourteenth century. (By contrast, the United States population is projected to grow by 44 percent between 2000 and 2050.)...\n \n (Snip)\n \n This essay appeared in the New York Times on April 4, 2004.\n \n http://www.hooverdigest.org/043/ferguson2.html",

This fundamentalist interpretation of Islam calls for the establishment of a Caliphate across the Islamic world, beginning with the expulsion of the infidel from Muslim lands. It seeks support in much the same way Marxist doctrine did in the 20th Century, mixing Islamic religious teaching with perceived societal inadequacies. It teaches that every Muslim has their part to play and every Muslim can achieve Martyrdom. Such a doctrine does not need an organisation to spread. Indeed, it has spread like wildfire through the Madrassas and radical Mosques. Any Whabbist acting alone or in a group can take up this cause and more often than not it is older men acting on young disenfranchised Muslim men.\n \n It is thus an idea we have to defeat if we are to win the war on terror.\" \n \n \n http://geraldhowarth.org.uk/record.jsp?type=speech&ID=9",

I NEVER advocated genocide in the sense as you are suggesting and you know perfectly well that I did not. (That we should exterminate minorities.) We should however do whatever is required to ensure the terrorists fear us more than anything else. And my point about the Soviets was that the Germans certainly feared the Soviets so much that they did everything possible to surrender to the Allies. Even Himmler was trying to cut a deal with us rather than fall into Soviet hands. \n \n Fear is a very powerful motivator. Prior to 9/11, the terrorists certainly did not fear us. I rather imagine they have begun to change their opinions since Bush went on the offensive. No more Mr. Nice Guy. That's what wins wars whether conventional or terrorism. Don't you think that our carpet bombing of the Taliban was viewed as \"terror\" by them? I certainly hope so. But it was not unprovoked terror on innocent civilians as happened on 9/11. Huge difference. \n \n Yes, I have said that. We should be even more terrible than the terrorists who hit us on 9/11. I like to think back to WWII when the Soviets took Berlin. Estimates of 150,000 to 350,000 dead Soviets resulted from the storming of Berlin. Stalin gave his generals carte blanche to do whatever was required. And so they did. Do you ever wonder why the Nazis were desperately trying to be captured by the Allies? They didn't want to fall into the hands of the Soviets. Of the 95,000 German soldiers who were captured after the Battle of Stalingrad, only 5,000 lived to return home. It was said that the \"Partisans\" of the Soviet Union were even more vicious than the SS that preceded them into that country. They took great pleasure in cutting the throats of any Germans they caught and raped and pillaged as they saw fit.\n \n The bottom line is: Who won the war? That's the only thing that counts.

   "Question for you Missouri, if you (meaning America, meaning the American government, which you identify yourself with), become \"more terrible than the terrorists\", on what moral grounds should you win?\n \n Why should the rest of the world want you to win? Why should even Americans, who have anything but nationalist interests at heart, that is to say, Americans with morals, want you to win?\n \n Do you really think, that without moral right on your side, you can win? That you can destroy an enemy by bombs when you are losing the hearts of everyone who sees what you are doing?\n \n Becoming \"terrible\" to win, in an age of non-state forces and free flowing information, is a recipe for loss. And even if somehow, if through totalitarian methods, you managed to win; what kind of win would that be?\n \n To \"win at all costs\", meaning to fight an enemy you do not need to fight, for the sake of your inflated sense of nationalist egotism, is not a strategy, it is a sign of insanity.\n\n \n I'm little concerned about what the enemy thinks of us so long as they respect our power enough not to mess with us. As the saying goes, don't bring a knife to a gunfight. The terrorists reckoned that Bush would follow the policies of his predecessor and send a \"missile up some camel's butt.\" He said that wouldn't do and that we would end this terror threat once and for all. That requires actions that have not been employed in many years; namely WWII when all things were on the table.

About 7000 to 10000 of the roughly 50,000 buildings in the town are estimated to have been destroyed in the offensive, and half to two-thirds of the buildings have suffered notable damage. Reconstruction is only progressing slowly and mainly consists of clearing rubble from heavily-damaged areas and reestablishing basic utility services. This is also due to the fact that only 10% of the pre-offensive inhabitants had returned as of mid-January, and only 30% as of the end of March 2005.\n \n Pre-offensive inhabitant figures are unreliable; the nominal population was assumed to have been 200-350,000. Thus, over 150,000 individuals are still living in harsh conditions in tent cities outside Fallujah.\n \n Basically, the town was destroyed.",
