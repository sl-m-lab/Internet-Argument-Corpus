   "I am interested in society structures and what drives them. My approach to society and philosophy is driven by the empiricisms and schemas of such philosophers as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, David Hume, and of course Marx.\n \n Premise\n The premise of my utopia is to provide everyone with the best possible life they could have. My primary concern is the comfort and protection of the people. \n \n \n Government Politics \n I would design a government that is partially Republic and Aristocracy. The people elect a sovereign as their voice. The sovereign controls the military and has primary power. He would be backed by a parliament that controls all other government functions and keeps him in check. The parliament elects its own officials. \n \n \n Financial Politics\n My financial policy is predominantly social with capitalist endeavors. It has three basic parts: Government controlled, government sanctioned, and private industry. \n \n Government controlled: Basically, the government controls all basic necessities of its people. Food, water, shelter, transportation, education, sanitation, energy, and medical care. Government employees do not make large wages, and their wages are paid by difficulty of profession, however all of their necessities are provided. The government controls so many resources that there should never be shortage of work.\n \n Government sanctioned: Private investors sponsored by the government. They are granted government aid in return for service treaties and goods.\n \n Private industries: Entertainment, fasion, advanced living, realestate, technology, recreation, advanced transportation, etc. All private industries run independent of the government. Private industry owners and employees do not receive government support for basic necessities. Therefore, wages must be much greater than the government could provide.\n \n The nice part about the system is that it allows two options for finding comfort: Those people who want to live on the government, and those who want to satisfy their drive for success. If you fail in one, you can always switch back to the other, and infact, is encouraged to get ahead. The system gives everyone a chance. This also means that government controlled industries will always be fairly maintained and quality of goods and services will always remain static. And private industries, in turn, can do whatever the hell they like.\n \n \n Protection\n The utopia is protected externally by its military, lead by the sovereign. It is internally protected by police and law officials appointed by the parliament. The parliament sustains the people, and without its functions, the society would fail. This is what keeps the sovereign in check. The basic principle is more about autonomy. Abuse of power can be checked one way or the other.\n \n \n Summary\n I am awesome. Everyone vote for me. :) :) :)",

   "Leviathan, you call that a utopia? It seems more like an Orwellian hell to me.\n \n I think you have the wrong premise. People cannot be provided with a good life by some outside party like government, because outside parties are detached from individual preferences. Instead, people must have the freedom to improve their own lives according to their own preferences.\n \n If I could create a utopia, it would revolve around these three principles:\n \n < Self-Ownership: You are the master of your own body and mind. You can do whatever you want with it as long as you don't violate someone else's rights.\n \n < Personal Property Rights: You are the master of the products of your labor. You can modify them, trade them, and share them with other people. Nobody can take them from you by force.\n \n < Natural Commons: Nature (that is, anything not human or artificial) is accessible to everybody.\n \n Within this individualist framework, people would be able to form voluntary associations - marriages, companies, worker's co-operatives, etc.\n \n There would, of course, be some superficial organization - perhaps a constitutional republic - to defend these rights and retaliate against anyone who violates them.

(been to the motor vehicle dept. lately?) Can u really imagine government run supermarkets, much less the rest of the food chain? \n\n \n I could certainly imagine governmentally run supermarkets (allthough I don`t really see the need). Governmentally run bussineses tend to be less cost efficient than privatly owned firms when:\n 1) The bussines has other motives and goals than profit. Profit incentives create a more cost-efficient organisation for natural reasons (but not necessarily more socio-economic efficient)\n 2) The business has some form of government monopoly. Competition foster cost-efficiency. Allthough monopolies can arise without government regulation/ownership as well.\n \n Government run bussineses can also be quite efficient and competative, even on a global scale and even in commodities (not merely natural resource extraction). For example; If you ever have drunk Absolut Vodka, you have drunk a governmentally produced (and exported!) product. \n \n \nI think it was tried; government run farms, food distribution centers and \"super\" markets. It was called the Soviet Union.\n\n \n They where not only governmentally owned and run, they where also based on a planned economic system. Jugoslavia on the other hand utilized certain market powers while maintaining government ownership of the industries. It was certainly not as innefficient as the soviet system (allthough the Jugoslavian economy was not really booming)\n \n \nUnless part of your utopia includes fostering slim people thru starvation rations, imo, some rethinking may be necessary. cheers.\n\n \n Actually, the economic system outlined by Levithan is not so different from the one I enjoy in my country (allthough, we have started to privatise many markets the last decade).

The distillation plant in \u00c5hus is privatly owned and is contracted to produce the spirit Absolut Vodka for the governmentally owned company \"Vin&Sprit\" (Wine and Spirits). One could perhaps make the argument that the actual production process is carried out by a private firm. However, since the Absolut Company in \u00c5hus is merely a sub-contractor among others (Vin&Sprit make use of many other sub-contractors as well, such as advertising firms, logistics companies, temp. agencies etc, etc) I would definatly say that \"Vin&Sprit\" is the firm that actually owns, produces and exports the Absolut Vodka. Just like every McDonalds resturant makes use of local farmers and slaughterhouses, they are still the ones who make and sell the Big Mac. \n \n \nDo u have another example? I think they r rara avis\n \n\n \n Sure do. Even though I think my example still stands. \n \n LKAB (Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB) is another (relative) large export firm from Sweden. They extract metal ore that is being sold to Europe, Asia and the US. They are responsible for far more exports than \"Vin&Sprit\", but I don`t think you`ve heard of it (Absolut Vodka is more of a high profile brand that LKAB iron ore ;)).\n \n Another example Svenska Skog AB (Swedish Forest inc.), harvesting, proccessing and exporting Swedish lumber to various countries in Europe and Asia.\n \n As is Vattenfall AB (Waterfall inc.) that produces and exports electricity to our neighbouring countries.\n \n Then there is Green Cargo AB, supplying logistics for firms throughout Europe.\n \n I probably could go about governmentally owned export firms from Sweden if I dug a bit, but I think you get my point. Governmentally owned export firms are not as uncommon as one would think.\n \n A perhaps more illustrative example is that the, by far, largest owner on the Stockholm Stock Exchange is our government... \n \n \n \nAnything the government gets involved in here can end up being staffed by incompetent political hacks or their friends.

We still rank among the highest ssuicide nations, nevermind that we are among the happiest people according to various surveys. We are a troubled people, no doubt. But it`s not contagious ;)\n \n As for the Viking era, sadly this period has been shamefully exploited by the entertainment industry. I hope the course you took did the period more justice\n \n If you do choose to come here, you simply must see the Stockholm Archipelago (as well as Stockholm itself).

The premise was mind your own business. There was definitely a strong sense of personal issues in a person's life needn't become public, and in fact there were laws against it. Live and let live.\n\n Sweet. Most people will eventually buy this hook, line and sinker. It's easily marketable to the masses too and sounds perfectly reasonable. Only, while I or you may believe it, the 'other' may not. \n \n \n2. Representative Republic, but with modifications to the current US form.

However when the nation is under threat of invasion, Congress can initiate a draft without having it put to a vote.\n\n Sounds good. Until you realize that most people will eventually always vote NO simply so they don't have to do anything. With a good PR campaign supported domestically with foreign ties, my nation won't do anything over seas until it's too late. People will mostly become isolationists. If the whole world is on the same page, we're fine. The moment another Hitler or Attilla type decides to domino effect his neighbors off one by one. Eating the smaller conquests and allowing time to digest them all the while we vote NO to intervene, the cause is lost. Because while appeasement might seem like a practical thing, there's no real guarantee that they won't eventually get around to us. At a point in which even having a draft to defend ourselves won't suffice.\n \n \n3. The system of finance is purely theoretical.

Sitting on my arse is what I like to do for a living and suits me fine. \n Taking advantage of high demand jobs is what makes people take jobs they don't like in the first place...to get the higher salary. So that they can ensure that they can afford the items they desire.\n And a government supported barter system with 'stock piled itesm' is daft. You lament mass produced excess yet say the government has exactly that.\n What are you? A pacifist commie? That's what I'm a gunna calls you. Makes it easier for others to 'mind their own business' while I pound on ya with me boot.\n Trade in 'currancy people don't value for goods'...BwAhahahahahahaha.\n I'll give you $1 bills for your $20s and call it toilet paper.\n \n \n4.

It will work when people are tired of overproducing products ridiculously in order to be \"competitive\". It will work when people are willing to be more reasonable.\n\n It would never work. You rely upon the gullibility and possibly apathy of ALL people. While I beat the **** out of Joe, I can persuade Bob to not bother to intervene. So long as I persuade 'you' to do nothing because it's in your best interest, a maverick (And humanity is FULL of them) will have a near free reign.\n And, while many are naive and incapable of seeing the interconnectivity and that ALL things affect one another and desire not to 'mess with them over there', wiser heads know better. If there are 'LAWS' that force people to 'mind their own business' then we'd HAVE to go to war to ensure that other people (like me) mind their own business. This end runs your vote on foreign wars thing. Since we're interconnected on this small world.\n And, while you think items are mass produced to ridiculousness, they aren't...unless you're thinking of those little trinkets you find in .25 cent gum ball machines that bring .25 cents worth of temporary enjoyment to a child. And, mass production isn't 'competitive.' Producing goods that are desired and consumed is competitive. No one ever got successful on manufacturing items that went to waste...unless financed by the government. emoticon_frazzled \n \n \n My boot meets your face...to everyone else, mind your own business, m'kay? thanks (I'll get to you later).\n \n I teh WIN!1!! emoticon_rolleyes",

A communist wishes to abolish the exploitation of man by man.

Anarchists call for the immediate abolition of the state and all private property. \n \n A socialist is a person who supports a socialist system - in other words, a system of public ownership over the means of production, with a planned economy and a democratic state - but without wishing for that system to eventually turn into a communist one. A socialist wants to abolish private property over the means of production, but maintain personal property and the state. A socialist wants to reduce inequality to a minimum, but not remove it entirely. \n \n A social democrat is someone who wants to combine socialism with capitalism. Social democrats believe they are taking the \"best\" elements of both socialism and capitalism and using them together to create a \"mixed economy\" (also known as a welfare state). \n \n A centrist or moderate is a person who doesn't really hold any political views, and simply chooses whatever option seems best to him/her at one particular time. \n \n A liberal is someone who supports capitalism (private property over the means of production) but wants people to have freedom of choice in personal matters. \n \n A conservative is someone who supports capitalism (private property over the means of production) and also supports rigid \"traditional values\" in personal matters. \n \n A nationalist is a person who puts his or her nation above anything else, who blindly supports his nation regardless of whether it is right or wrong, and who believes in strict hierarchy and obedience. \n \n A fascist is someone who has a burning hatred for democracy, human rights, and all forms of equality. A fascist supports dictatorship, an even more strict hierarchy than that of the nationalists, and brutal treatment of political opponents.

Communism is a classless, propertyless, stateless social system organized along the principle \"from each, according to his ability; to each, according to his needs\".\n\n \n What, you want to phase out personal property? That is a direct assault on the liberty of the worker, I say.\n \n The domain of property has its place, just as the domain of self-ownership and the common domain have their places. Specifically, property and the absence thereof is justified by the right to work, which can be divided into two rights:\n \n < The right to initiate any undertaking without requiring anyone else's permission, so long as doing so does not violate the individual right to self-ownership or:\n \n < The right to continue an undertaking without unwanted interference from other individuals.\n \n These in turn derive their justification from the right, as Jefferson put it, to pursue happiness.\n \n The initiation of an undertaking is the harvesting of a resource - in order to grow a plant, someone must first pick a seed from another plant, and in order to build a car, someone must mine the metals needed to build a car, and so on.\n \n Individual property therefore justly exists over the resources which he has harvested from Nature. Thus he can control his undertaking, and modify his resources as he will, and produce a final product, which in turn he may own as well. But if property rights go so far as to restrict the harvesting of resources from Nature, they violate the first component of the right to work - the right to initiate work.\n \n I make the distinction between \"regal property\" and \"personal property.\" Regal property is the ownership of unharvested resources; namely, land ownership. Regal property is unjust - unharvested resources ought to be accessible to all. Personal property is the ownership of harvested resources and anything produced from them. This is justified when the resources are initially owned by the individuals who harvest them. Personal property may be owned individually or shared voluntarily, not to mention exchanged in a free market. It is wrong to assert that all undertakings must be lone individual efforts, just as it is wrong to assert that all undertakings must be mass collective efforts.\n \n But if the right to personal property is denied, then any thug would be able to run up and steal the crops that a farmer is growing, or wreck a car that the workers are trying to build, and such.
