And the government isn't above the murder of lots of people, including burning three astronauts alive, to keep the secret. Yep. That's sane. This sort of claptrap is on a level with a 6000 year old earth, except that not even the creationists buy into this one.\n \n Here is one site that deals with the illiterate science that the Fox television show \"revealed\".

You can test this out yourself here on earth.\n \n 3) The sun is not the only source of light on the moon. Actually, the moon itself is one, and reflects light in a rather pecular way.\n \n 4) This one is new to me, but I can assure you its equally absurd.\n \n 5) The van Allen belts (which are, by the way, outside of our atmosphere) were passed through too quickly to harm astronauts.

   "Hi,\n after reading this thread...it started out okay at first, but I can't stand it when people propose fresh alternatives (if they could be called fresh alternatives) to present theories.\n \n First of all, this is not an opinion. There is no \"undecided\": either we did or we didn't. You can undecided as whether or not we did or did not land on the moon, but we can't have \"sort of\" landed on the moon.\n \n \nOriginally Posted by God Fearing Ath\n Do you think that, had we faked it, the commies wouldnt have uttered a peep about it?\n \n -GFA\n\n That's right...if there was any possibility we didn't do it the Soviets would have jumped right on top of us and shouted, \"Wait a minute! it was a hoax!\"\n \n \nI have an odd, but compromise theory...\n \n I believe Armstrong et al got to the moon, but they weren't sure about the quality of the pictures, so before-hand they staged them, and then broadcast these.\n \n In other words, the landings were real, but some of the pictures were fake!\n\n \n Sure...exactly...I'm sure that answers just all of our questions. 'Weren't sure about the quality of the pictures...' and so all that training and research was for nothing then? Ten years, you come out with some of the most awe-inspiring technology the world has yet seen, and then you realize you're not sure if your cameras can take high quality pictures on the moon, so you faked it. Riiiiight...\n Sort of like this argument: someone once said on a forum that he/she thought that we DID go to the moon, but we just forgot our camera. Yep...I'm sure that happened. \"Houston, we have a problem. We, uh, forgot the camera. Why don't we do a fake?\" \"Yeah, ok, sure, why not? Now, lets come back, think of something nice to say to the public on TV...and then go.\" (then there's the fact that the cameras were attached to the spacesuit)\n \n Another point to make:\n \n It can easily proved that the pictures are not fake. For instance, all those \"discrepancies\" of various \"mistakes\" are not \"mistakes\" after all. They came out as mistakes because that we took them on the moon, and I'm sure everyone realized a long time ago that common sense as we know it broke down on the moon.\n In other words, the \"mistakes\" prove that we did go to the moon because that these situations can occur only on the moon - not on earth.\n \n Finally...\n \n \nshadows: in a lot of the pictures, the shadows do not match.\n\n I believe that giligan is arguing that the shadows go of different people go in different directions, and that can't be possible on the moon because there is only one light source, the sun, and of course the sun is the only light source because the idiot who came up with that argument in the first place forgot that the earth, the surface of the moon, the astronauts, and the lunar lander ALL reflected light onto the moon.\n \n Sorry if my arguments seem a little jumbled or out of place...this was my first time reading through this thread and I tried to find some way to respond to various posts.",

We would not fake our way to the moon and lose the trust of both our nation and other nations just to put a flag on a peice of dirt.
