   "This is a bloody game for power. And methods of that game are dirty. The main reason of it is power and power is money. And for money some people are ready to do everything and talk what people want to hear. And now some Russian democratic parties (Yabloko and SPS) are trying to create coalition before evections in Moscow town council. Unfortunately, the main reason of this unification is coming back on the political scene after their collapse in State Duma elections 2003. And now they are going to use November 27 anti-fascist march with the aim. Yes, I think you know that in Russia happened some accidents resulting in death of foreign students (from Korea, Namibia and other countries). And new democratic coalition wants to call to people to stop it. Yes, the plan is very good but not before elections, to tell the truth all it looks like PR action and nothing more! They try to get voters; they don't care about situation with the killings. They are exploiting fear of violence and fascism for their PR! It's really a pity.",
