   "Researchers at the University of Minnesota have published a study showing that the degree of internalized homonegativity (negative attitude towards homosexuality) among homosexual men is what predicts poor mental and sexual health - not the act of being homosexual. \n \n As part of attending an HIV prevention seminar, 422 Midwestern gay and bisexual men completed surveys assessing their degree of homosexuality, their degree of positive or negative attitudes towards homosexuality, and a range of mental and sexual health variables. \n \n In all cases, internalized homonegativity, not being homosexual, predicted poorer mental health (particularly increased depression) and worse sexual health. The study appears in the September issue of the Journal of Homosexuality. \n \n The study helps inform the debate of whether or not being homosexual is healthy, said Simon Rosser, Ph.D., a researcher in the School of Public Health and principal investigator of the study. \n \n \"This study is a missing link in our understanding of the relationship between sexuality and health,\" he said. \"It provides new evidence that negative attitudes towards homosexuality, not homosexuality itself, are associated with both poorer mental and sexual health outcomes seen in sexual minorities. Conversely, positive attitudes towards homosexuality are associated with better mental and sexual health.\" \n \n For more than 150 years, scholars and educators have debated whether homosexuality is an objective disorder or whether societal prejudice, not homosexuality, leads to the elevated rates of depression, drug use, and HIV/STD epidemics seen in studies of gay men, Rosser said. This study tested both theories. \n \n \"Given the debates in many religious denominations about homosexuality, and in society about homosexuals and civil rights, it's also timely,\" Rosser said. \"In particular, the old advice to gay men to fight, deny, or minimize their homosexuality likely only increases depression, greater isolation, and poorer sexual health. In short, viewing homosexuality as a disorder is not only inaccurate, it may be harmful as well.\" http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-09/uom-hnf091708.php\n \n Another study telling us the obvious, which I expect some people will never learn...",

   "Sigma's questions are interesting, but off the topic of shame and its effects on gay people.\n \n Shame in other areas may or may not be useful. In terms of disorders, an argument I've seen made is that, say, the pedophile, should be treated as though having a physical disease such as cancer. In other words, no shame is attached by society for one's having cancer, so it wouldn't be applied to pedophilia. The focus would be entirely on diagnosis and treatment.\n \n Foundit makes the point that shame could possibly prevent the pedophile from acting, and harming children, even if it's only a short-term solution. This is a reason. When it comes to gay people, we do not have a disorder, and don't harm anyone.

   "Sigma's questions are interesting, but off the topic of shame and its effects on gay people.\n\n \n It's effect on homosexual people is what the effect of feeling ashamed of one's sexual desire would be on anyone. A homosexual's shame does not give unique behaviors, shame in general gives universal effects. \n \n There really should be no difference between talking about the effects of shame for being homosexual vs the effects of shame for [insert anamolous sexual desire here]. To draw a distinction is dishonest.\n \n \nShame in other areas may or may not be useful. In terms of disorders, an argument I've seen made is that, say, the pedophile, should be treated as though having a physical disease such as cancer. In other words, no shame is attached by society for one's having cancer, so it wouldn't be applied to pedophilia. The focus would be entirely on diagnosis and treatment.\n\n \n That's sort of the rub, isn't it? Pedophilia, like homosexuality, has so far been resistant to anything even resembling a \"cure\". It really appears to be an immutable sexual desire and is very frowned upon by society as homosexuality was in the past. I do agree that desires should not be frowned upon (even if the behaviors are) since it leads to negative behavior as the study provided points out. Liberal sexual views by society likely would prevent many dangerous sexual outlets if we could accept that these desires validly exist and need to be dealt with in a healthy manner.\n \n \nFoundit makes the point that shame could possibly prevent the pedophile from acting, and harming children, even if it's only a short-term solution. This is a reason.\n\n \n This, of course, would work to prevent homosexual behavior then? Or would it lead to self-destructive behavior that we should avoid? \n \n Your view depends entirely on what is acceptable to society when the point of the article is that society not accepting a certain sexual desire leads to negative behavior. You are giving a subjective view that this negative behavior is worth it because you don't like the sexual desires of certain people. This is a hypocritical view.",

After all, without action, it's all in the person's head with no impact upon society.\n So, in that isolated case where the desire exists without possibility of becoming action, I don't see a point.\n \n It's like an alcoholic who has gone 25 months without a drink.\n The guy has the desire (and/or risk) for the alcohol, which makes him an alcoholic.\n But he recognizes the destructiveness of the desire turned to action, and that is the important thing.\n \n \n \nAye, I know this.\n\n Your previous statements (regarding what I supposedly \"willingly\" do) bely this claim...\n \n \n \nI'm asking if you think it is acceptable and why you think that.\n\n I'm amused at the dual nature of the proposal.\n Why should it be an issue of \"acceptable\" to me in the first place?\n Isn't the whole hypothetical idea of a society deeming a sexual desire as \"not acceptable\" the problem in the first place?\n And now you want to get me to reverse the approach, which would conceivably flip the problem.

The behavior is irrelevant, the appropriatness of shame for the desire is the question.\n\n Nothing in my position is \"confused\" by a fact I have repeatedly acknowledged.\n I welcome you to show ANY argument I have made which is supposedly \"confused\" by this fact that I have repeatedly acknowledged.\n \n Behavior IS relevant in evaluating potential benefits to \"shame\", as it can be a part of the positive mechanism.\n What you are doing is like trying to say that a levee is unimportant, and then insisting that we cannot examine the effect of the levee during a hurricane. Cause after all, the existence of the ocean does not imply that the hurricane exists... emoticon_xdonno\n \n One thing you should consider is the REASON for the societal condemnation.\n If NO PEDOPHILE ever committed an act of child molestation or child pornography, do you think that he would be reviled? emoticon_xdonno\n For pedophiles, it's clearly a reaction to the NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES of harming a child. The justification exists in secular reasons.\n For gays, no such mechanism exists. The justification for condemning gays comes typically in RELIGIOUS approaches, based on archaic writings from people who claimed to see burning / talking bushes... \n \n There is a difference there that should not need to be spelled out...",

   "It's effect on homosexual people is what the effect of feeling ashamed of one's sexual desire would be on anyone. A homosexual's shame does not give unique behaviors, shame in general gives universal effects.\n\n \n It's not quite that simple. There is a different reality when it comes to homosexuality. Like I said, being gay isn't a disorder, it doesn't harm anyone. In the case of disorders and harmful activity, the person can be reasoned with as to seeing that he or she, rationally speaking, does require help. \n \n \nThere really should be no difference between talking about the effects of shame for being homosexual vs the effects of shame for [insert anamolous sexual desire here]. To draw a distinction is dishonest.\n\n \n Everything isn't black and white, as I explained above.\n \n \nThat's sort of the rub, isn't it? Pedophilia, like homosexuality, has so far been resistant to anything even resembling a \"cure\".\n\n \n One isn't cured of mental disorders, sexual or not. One learns control. Homosexuality, not being a disorder doesn't require a cure. Why would you lump it in with pedophilia in this regard? It doesn't make sense.\n \n \nIt really appears to be an immutable sexual desire and is very frowned upon by society as homosexuality was in the past.\n\n \n That was a mistake in regards to homosexuality. The past is the past. You're comparing apples to oranges.\n \n \nI do agree that desires should not be frowned upon (even if the behaviors are) since it leads to negative behavior as the study provided points out. Liberal sexual views by society likely would prevent many dangerous sexual outlets if we could accept that these desires validly exist and need to be dealt with in a healthy manner.\n\n \n Food for thought. I've never thought of it that way.\n \n \nThis, of course, would work to prevent homosexual behavior then? Or would it lead to self-destructive behavior that we should avoid?\n\n \n Perhaps in the short term. But why should homosexual behaviour in itself, be prevented? \n \n \nYour view depends entirely on what is acceptable to society when the point of the article is that society not accepting a certain sexual desire leads to negative behavior. You are giving a subjective view that this negative behavior is worth it because you don't like the sexual desires of certain people. This is a hypocritical view.\n\n \n No, it depends on modern psychology. There is observable harm which comes from child molestation, for pity's sake! It's not simply because I don't care for it.

The study would broadly apply to any human being whose anomolous sexual desire is unacceptable to society.\n \n \nYou are straight, right? I think you over-emphasize the importance of a perception of \"naturally\" and \"with each other\" that is not seen in actual homosexuals. It just isn't as important as the love that binds a couple.\n [...]\n Again, you're emphasizing attributes which are not really that significant. I mentioned elderly couples earlier, whereby they cannot reproduce. Other couples who cannot or do not reproduce are not stigmatized. There is no reason to delineate between couples who \"do\" and who \"do not\" reproduce in establishing a stigma barrier.\n [...]\n If a couple \"cannot\" reproduce, we have some pity for them. But for gay couples, which admittedly cannot reproduce, it's a stigma\n\n \n The attraction that couples feel towards each other is an integral part of reproduction whether or not reproduction actually occurs. Instinctually, imo, people believe this and homosexual couples run counter to that belief. A barren couple would be pitied since their instinctual and understandable desire to have children will be unfulfilled while the homosexual couple actively run counter to that instinctual desire.\n \n Think of Tom Hanks in Castaway when he makes up a companion out of social starvation. Social interaction is a powerful instinct that we, as humans, have an understandable need for and those who actively run counter to socially interacting have a stigma attached to them.\n \n \nI just don't think it matches human reaction to be a real reason for the reaction / treatment of gays. It is more logical to observe the historical treatment against gays based on religious doctrine, and realize that is the reason.\n\n \n Personally I think my opinion has an easier time explaining the generalized stigma that you rightly identify as existing. Religion isn't as a pervasive influence to give such a gut level reaction toward homosexuals. An instinctual response seems more appropriate.\n \n Certainly blaming it on religion is easier, but remember even religion is an outgrowth of human nature.\n \n \nI seriously think you are oversimplifying things. \"Babies\" are made in many species without any pretense of \"love\". If sex is pleasurable only to \"have babies\", then why are there so many gay animals in nature that have gay sex without a possibility of babies. Why are the gay animals in nature not ostracized like the gay humans are?\n\n \n Love (or attraction), in humans, facilitates mating. Pleasure during mating facilitates more mating. Mating is the mechanism to have children. Children are the ultimate \"goal\" of evolution.\n \n Why are there homosexual animals? Heck, for that matter why are the homosexual humans? For the same reason there are any anomolous sexual desires. We are not clones of each other. Sexual reproduction produces enough variety that there will be non-reproductive variants. Luckily there are few enough of those that the species continues. It is this way with any sexually reproducing species. Some mutations cannot reproduce, but, if homosexuality is indeed genetic, the fact that homosexuals can biologically reproduce means that a certain percentage will pass on their genes to the next generation.\n \n \nThe same could be said of heterosexual oral sex, or heterosexual masturbation. It does not result in reproduction, but is not treated with the stigma that gays see.\n\n \n Masterbation and oral sex are simulations of heterosexual sex. They engage senses and reactions that have been designed by evolution for reproduction. Keep in mind that our instincts do not control our actions, they merely give us desires that can be fulfilled by other means. Homosexual sex also engages senses and reactions that have been designed for reproductive sex in a similar way with similar effect, and perhaps this is part of the stigma. Perhaps trying to label homosexual sex as being as significant as heterosexual sex creates the impression that homosexuals are labeling something as insignificant as masterbation as being as equal to heterosexual sex. \n \n That said, would you be content with homosexuality being classified as relevent as masturbation or oral sex?\n \n \nBut such an approach demonstrates how meaningless actual babies are to the process.\n\n \n I'm not really talking about physical babies. I'm talking about the desire, conscious or unconscious, to have them. That desire is instinctual and is the purpose behind both love/attraction and the reason sex is pleasurable. Babies play a central and significant role in our instinctual desires. Even the desire for sex itself or the desire for \"closeness\" that sex brings to relationships exists to facilitate reproduction.\n \n Programmed desires do not control our actions, they merely give us instinctual desires that we fulfill in any number of ways. The desire for sex with a woman can be simulated and our programmed desires are still fooled. However, that program desire exists to facilitate reproduction.\n \n \n Women who are pregnant sometimes experience documented heightened desires for sexual intercourse DURING the pregnancy. WHERE is the sense in that if the purpose is to GET pregnant?\n\n \n There are several theories as to why this occurs. One is, of course, to keep the male interested in sticking around instead of having children with another woman (since the desire of the male is to have as many children as possible while the desire of the female is to have children with desirable males and to keep the resources the male brings to the relationship for herself and her children alone: ie not share those resources with other women and children).\n \n Sex during pregnancy also has a positive effect of making birthing easier.\n \n \nNo. There is a lot more going on than just a casual \"we want to have babies\" attitude.\n\n \n There is more going on but it all boils down to having children. Seriously. Behavioral evolutionary theory centers around the goal of having children.",

   "It's not quite that simple. There is a different reality when it comes to homosexuality. Like I said, being gay isn't a disorder, it doesn't harm anyone. In the case of disorders and harmful activity, the person can be reasoned with as to seeing that he or she, rationally speaking, does require help. \n\n \n No desire harms anyone. It is an internal desire. Immutable sexual desire cannot be reasoned with, unless you wish to suggest homosexual desire can be \"reasoned with\".\n \n \nOne isn't cured of mental disorders, sexual or not. One learns control. Homosexuality, not being a disorder doesn't require a cure. Why would you lump it in with pedophilia in this regard?

They are immutable sexual desires.\n \n \nThat was a mistake in regards to homosexuality. The past is the past.

There is observable harm which comes from child molestation, for pity's sake! It's not simply because I don't care for it. Come on now, Sigma.\n\n \n Absolutely I agree. Instead of hating pedophiles we should, imo, pity them. Imagine that the rationale you have used against pedophiles is used against homosexuals with the same effect. Homosexuals would be locked into self-loathing (as described by this study) and know that they cannot fulfill their sexual desires in any way, shape or form without entire communities and nations raining brimstone down upon them.\n \n Pedophiles can never fulfill their sexual desires since harm to children cannot be accepted by society (and almost without exception molestation harms children). However, the fact that this is an immutable sexual desire gives it validity in a study such as this since pedophiles, zoophiles and other anomolous sexual deviants would absolutely have societal prejudice leveled against them merely because of the sexual desires they have (similar to the prejudice homosexuals must contend with). Any sympathy for homosexuals that cannot realize that even the most reviled group of our society deserves the very same sympathy is simply a hypocritical view imo.\n \n That this study is narrowly focused cannot lead us into similarly narrow thinking.",

This study tested both theories.\n Societal prejudice was blamed by the study for the negative behaviors seen in homosexuals.\n\n Let me try to clarify the real source of dispute.\n 1) I whole-heartedly believe that \"societal prejudice\" is part of the reason for \"homonegativity\".\n But it is not shown to be the \"only\" reason.\n \n 2) There are other ADDITIONAL sources for internal \"negativity\" towards OTHER sexual desires.\n These should not be blindly discounted or ignored.\n \n \n \nUnless you wish to argue that societal prejudice causes a unique reaction to homosexuals, this point cannot be supported.

Couples who practice \"safe sex\" to prevent pregnancy would also be condemned as they would also be \"actively running counter\".\n [&#8230;]\n No. They aren't. There is nothing unique to these acts which dictates a \"heterosexual sex\" association. There is no foundation for this claim.\n \n\n \n Imo I refuted the assertion that the activities you described have nothing to do with heterosexual sex, but I'll try to give basic steps to find where we disagree specifically.\n \n Heterosexual desire and heterosexual sex are the basis upon which any sexually reproducing species evolves. There must be traits and methods (physical and/or social) to facilitate mating, otherwise no species would mate. Those traits that would encourage mating would be generally passed on. This is very basic to evolutionary theory and behavioral science\n \n Heterosexual desire and heterosexual sex both facilitate the purpose of reproduction. Pleasure during reproductive sex is an essential component in the encouragement of mating. This trait would then be passed on and expanded upon. The pleasurable component of mating exists because it facilitates mating. This is a fact, not an opinion.\n \n Manual stimulation must engage the senses and reactions that evolved to facilitate heterosexual sex since the pleasurable feeling that occurs exists because it facilitates reproductive sex. If manual stimulation did not trigger at least some of the pleasure that occurs during reproductive sex then people would not do it. \n \n \n \n And \"gut level reaction\"? Again I think you over-estimate the cause of the negativity towards homosexuals. If it were truly \"gut level\", then society wouldn't change on the issue. People wouldn't be so concerned about positive gay role models cause people would know in their \"gut\" it was wrong.\n [&#8230;]\n No. The negativity towards gays is indoctrinated. There is a HUGE social shift on attitudes towards gays. That wouldn't be possible if it was inherent in the \"gut\".\n \n\n \n I don&#8217;t think I agree with this. An instinctual negative reaction doesn&#8217;t predict that people don&#8217;t overcome that reaction with reason and logic and decide that they believe in equal rights. It&#8217;s the same reason people can say that they don&#8217;t agree with what you say but they believe in your right to say it.\n \n Also: the only indoctrination that is happening on a societal level is acceptance of homosexuals. That&#8217;s the reason for any &#8220;social shift&#8221; you see, imo.\n \n \n \n You keep attributing things as having the \"purpose\" of your desired focus.\n [&#8230;]\n Actually, this aspect is also counter-productive to your explanation. Gays have just as much of a desire to have kids as straights do. By your explanation of the \"purpose\" of different things like love or sexual pleasure, the same gender attraction would conceivably be accompanied by an absence of the desire to have kids. The fact that gays still have the desire to have kids demonstrates the independence of the two mechanisms, instead of the \"cause and effect\" type relationship you claim.\n [&#8230;]\n And since all this is true for gays as well, it shoots more holes in your explanation.\n\n Actually this reinforces my point. \n \n Having children is an instinctual desire which has been programmed into us due to evolutionary pressures. The fact that homosexual couples are incapable of having children yet retain this programming gives evidence that homosexual desire is an aberration, not a variant of human evolution in its own right. Whether genetic or environmental, the sexual desire was skewed while retaining the general evolutionary programming to procreate. \n \n Procreation should be a desire no matter what other aberrations or mutations occur since reproduction is the only method to pass on those traits. The desire doesn't really exist to better the species, but to promote the survival of it's own brand of genetic code, which would mean children. Any mutation that has no procreation desire would not survive long.\n \n If homosexuals were found to not have any of the same instinctual imperatives associated with mating (which makes up the bulk of instinctual reactions, one way or another) then it would mean one of two things: either sexual desire and instinctual reproduction are caused by the same environmental/genetic marker or that homosexuals are a separate variant in human evolution.\n \n \n \n Wrong. Homosexuality benefits the overall survivability of the species .If you have only heterosexual couples, that will maximize the number of orphans with no parents. When some of the couples are homosexual, that reduces the number of orphans by introducing a new parenting group that does not procreate.\n\n \n Interesting theory, but with no evidence that this occurred in hunter-gatherer societies where this evolution would have occurred.\n \n \n \n People talk about \"procreation\" like it's the end-all and be-all with no negative problems. Homosexuality COMPLIMENTS the functionality of heterosexuality.\n [&#8230;]\n And the thing is that gays STILL DO facilitate the process. A father impregnates the mother. But he also goes off to work and helps not only his own family, but society in general. Gays can do that as well without splitting the focus with kids. Or they can adopt and help that way. The heterosexual reproduction model is actually over-driven, and we see that in our society with over-population and kids that can't be \"adequately\" cared for. Homosexuals can help to limit those problems \n\n \n You&#8217;re talking about modern society, not instincts that would have evolved far from anything resembling modern society. The hunter-gatherer society is driven by heterosexual attraction and reproduction and the social strategies developed to facilitate those desires.\n \n \n \n Another major problem with your story is the realization that MALE gay sex and FEMALE gay sex have ENTIRELY DIFFERENT Stigmas. Under your description, it would be logical to think that female gay sex would be MORE ostracized because the woman is the one that actually carries the baby.\n [&#8230;]\n If we assumed that the bible's condemnation was just an example of \"instinct\" instead of an actual CAUSE, this would be counter-productive to your theory.\n \n\n \n This is actually an interesting phenomenon but isn&#8217;t contradictory to this theory.\n \n One explanation is that it is an example of how homosexuality exists somewhat outside of what our instincts can adequately explain and so would normally trigger an instinctual stigma. To a (heterosexual) man a woman is related intrinsically to sex. When she is attracted to another man then this triggers emotions and reactions that have evolved to deal with this type of social situation. When she is attracted to a woman these same reactions do not occur since the other woman is also related intrinsically to sex. This confuses any gut level avoidance that would normally occur and simply gives the reaction of two sexual stimulations.\n \n Another possibility is that it seems more masturbatory than anything else; that the sex is not \"really\" sex between two people. Women masturbating are sexually stimulating to heterosexual men and having what essentially amounts to two women masturbating is simply twice as stimulating to the man with nothing else associating it to instinctual avoidance. Even using toys to penetrate each other would seem to be a heterosexual masturbatory method since anything penetrating a woman would be instinctually and necessarily a male-female type contact anyway.\n \n Perhaps a combination of these reasons.\n \n \n Gay relationships are just as deserving of legal recognition as straight relationships.\n\n \n I think this is where most people have their gut level avoidance. While heterosexual relationships give instinctual understanding and agreement, homosexual relationships run counter to those instincts. To many people, imo, heterosexual relationships deserve more consideration that homosexual relationships since they are the basis upon which every and all evolution of the species does and has depended.\n \n \n \n The male can still have sex with another woman even if the woman pregnant with his child wants sex. The mechanism does not prevent it at all.\n\n \n Nothing physically prevents him, certainly, but being available for sex (which means enjoying it enough to do it) would limit the amount of straying a man might do in search of sex. In fact the male&#8217;s instinctual desire is to have children by a variety of women, while a woman&#8217;s instinctual desire is to find a man that has the resources to care for her and her children. These are conflicting desires since the woman would then want to keep all of the man&#8217;s resources (his attention, social standing, money, whatever) to give her children the best chance of survival and so must develop strategies to prevent the man from seeking other woman. Lying, detecting lies, suspicion, trust, etc evolved as social strategies for social situations such as these.\n \n \n Furthermore, since the \"purpose\" is to have kids, the fact that \"additional\" purposes suddenly comes into play seems poignant. And ultimately, that is really the point regarding \"love\" and \"sex\". While they can come into play towards procreation, there is more going on than just that.\n\n \n Not really. The ultimate &#8220;goal&#8221; of evolution is to maximize the number of children that will reliably survive to have children of their own, and virtually any desire a person has arose to facilitate that purpose. Where I think you might be confused is that you think I am saying that people blindly desire to reproduce and desire nothing else. I am not trying to say that. \n \n Due to the evolution of humans as a species we have instinctual desires to do or have certain things because doing or having those things would generally give us a better chance at having children and have those children surviving long enough to have children of their own in the type of society that these desires evolved. These desires that seemingly have nothing to do directly with reproductive sex may instead relate to making oneself attractive as a mate or something more indirectly related to mating. However, the reason these desires evolved in the first place is because they enhanced our reproductive potential.\n \n \n You are very wrong in saying that it \"centers\" around that goal. There is a lot more going on than that.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology\n The mechanisms I discussed above are part of a look at the role that homosexuals play in \"evolution\".\n To look at it just as a picture of \"one function pumping out kids\" fails to examine the bigger picture and the diverse mechanisms that can help survivability of the species and family. Gays enhance survivability of both.\n\n \n The link you gave gives a more granular view than what I&#8217;m giving to you here. A perhaps more appropriate view is this\n \n The result is that \"the prevalent genes in a sexual population must be those that, as a mean condition, through a large number of genotypes in a large number of situations, have had the most favourable phenotypic effects for their own replication.\" (Williams, 1985) In other words, we expect selfish genes, \"selfish\" meaning that promotes its own survival without necessarily promoting the survival of the organism, group or even species. This theory implicates that adaptations are the phenotypic effects of genes to maximize their representation in the future generations. An adaptation is maintained by selection if it promotes genetic survival directly or some subordinate goal that ultimately contributes to successful reproduction.\n \n An adaption is only successful if it contributes to reproduction in some way. The link you gave describes strategies that are developed to satisfy this imperative.",

   "Male Homosexuality Can Be Explained Through A Specific Model Of Darwinian Evolution, Study Shows\n ScienceDaily (June 18, 2008) - An Italian research team, consisting of Andrea Camperio Ciani and Giovanni Zanzotto at the University of Padova and Paolo Cermelli at the University of Torino, found that the evolutionary origin and maintenance of male homosexuality in human populations could be explained by a model based around the idea of sexually antagonistic selection, in which genetic factors spread in the population by giving a reproductive advantage to one sex while disadvantaging the other.\n \n Male homosexuality is thought to be influenced by psycho-social factors, as well as having a genetic component. This is suggested by the high concordance of sexual orientation in identical twins and the fact that homosexuality is more common in males belonging to the maternal line of male homosexuals. These effects have not been shown for female homosexuality, indicating that these two phenomena may have very different origins and dynamics.\n \n Male homosexuality is difficult to explain under Darwinian evolutionary models, because carriers of genes predisposing towards male homosexuality would be likely to reproduce less than average, suggesting that alleles influencing homosexuality should progressively disappear from a population. This changed when previous work by Camperio Ciani and collaborators, published in 2004, showed that females in the maternal line of male homosexuals were more fertile than average.\n \n Challenged by all these empirical data, the authors of the new study considered a range of different hypotheses for the genetic diffusion of male homosexuality. These included: the genetic maternal effects on sons, the heterozygote advantage (as is found in malaria resistance), and \"sexually antagonistic selection.\" The latter is a particular aspect of Darwinian evolution, in which genetic factors spread in the population by giving a reproductive advantage to one sex while disadvantaging the other. This type of evolution has been previously found in insects, birds, and some mammals, but never in humans.\n \n To discover and clarify the dynamics of the genetic factors for homosexuality, the researchers had to screen a large set of models and exclude them one by one. They concluded that the only possible model was that of sexually antagonistic selection. The other models did not fit the empirical data, either implying that the alleles would become extinct too easily or invade the population, or failing to describe the distribution patterns of male homosexuality and female fecundity observed in the families of homosexuals. Only the model of sexually antagonistic selection involving at least two genes -- at least one of which must be on the X chromosome (inherited in males only through their mother) -- accounted for all the known data.\n \n The results of this model show the interaction of male homosexuality with increased female fecundity within human populations, in a complex dynamic, resulting in the maintenance of male homosexuality at stable and relatively low frequencies, and highlighting the effects of heredity through the maternal line.\n \n These findings provide new insights into male homosexuality in humans. In particular, they promote a focus shift in which homosexuality should not be viewed as a detrimental trait (due to the reduced male fecundity it entails), but, rather, should be considered within the wider evolutionary framework of a characteristic with gender-specific benefits, and which promotes female fecundity. This may well be the evolutionary origin of this genetic trait in human beings.\n \n The possible widespread occurrence of sexually antagonistic characteristics in evolutionary processes, which play their evolutionary game by giving a fecundity benefit to one sex while disadvantaging the other, has only recently begun to be appreciated. This is understood as a key mechanism through which high levels of genetic variation are maintained in biological populations. \n \n Male homosexuality is just the first example of an unknown number of sexually antagonistic traits, which contribute to the maintenance of the natural genetic variability of humans. The new perspectives opened by the models developed for sexually antagonistic selection may also contribute to a better understanding of most genetically-based sexual conflicts, which are, at present, poorly understood in humans.\n \n An unexpected implication of the new models concerns the impact that the sexually antagonistic genetic factors for male homosexuality have on the overall fecundity of a population. The findings suggest that the proportion of male homosexuals may signal a corresponding proportion of females with higher fecundity. Consequently, these factors always contribute, all else being equal, a positive net increase of the fecundity of the whole population, when compared to populations in which such factors are lower or absent. This increase grows as the population baseline fecundity decreases; this means that the genes influencing male homosexuality end up playing the role of a buffer effect on any external factors lowering the overall fecundity of the whole population.\n \n http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/06/080617204459.htm\n \n This person on youtube makes great points. There are many factors that contribute to evolution, and it happens to groups, not individuals...\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZWqQNRAoKY\n \n Trying to isolate one thing, such as direct popping out of babies, and saying that IS the complex process of evolution in a nutshell, and homosexuality or other factors are aberrations, is just false. It's like looking at one pixel of your computer screen and saying that is the whole picture.",

   "Then you argue that homosexuals have a unique reaction to societal prejudice?\n\n You're not listening.\n It's the fact that the \"reaction\" of \"negativity\" can be caused by OTHER FACTORS for other NON-gay issues.\n The \"oranges\" may have different or additional processing, and that cannot be neglected in assuming the same results.\n \n \n \nfoundit66, I keep refuting this point and you keep repeating it.\n\n You keep giving your opinion on how things work.\n I am not obligated to shut up just cause you say something that doesn't agree with me.\n \n \n \nHeterosexual desire and heterosexual sex are the basis upon which any sexually reproducing species evolves. There must be traits and methods (physical and/or social) to facilitate mating, otherwise no species would mate. Those traits that would encourage mating would be generally passed on. This is very basic to evolutionary theory and behavioral science\n\n If I took the function of the human body, I could see heart and lungs, circulating oxygen through the bloodstream of the body.\n Then I come across the finger. It doesn't facilitate that purpose.\n Ergo, should I just blindly remove it?\n No.\n \n The fingers play a part in benefiting the whole. If it weren't for the fingers and other things, the blood would not get nourishment.\n \n \n \nHeterosexual desire and heterosexual sex both facilitate the purpose of reproduction. Pleasure during reproductive sex is an essential component in the encouragement of mating.\n\n And therein lies another problem.\n You keep assuming a solitary, or exclusively primary function, ignoring other potential functions / benefits.\n \"Pleasure\" gives the human a lot more than just \"let's go procreate\".\n \n \n \nThe pleasurable component of mating exists because it facilitates mating. This is a fact, not an opinion.\n\n Actually, no. It isn't fact.\n You claim something \"exists because\", and you proclaim it as fact?\n Unless you get God himself to be your citation source, you are citing your personal interpretation of how things work.\n \n \n \nManual stimulation must engage the senses and reactions that evolved to facilitate heterosexual sex since the pleasurable feeling that occurs exists because it facilitates reproductive sex. If manual stimulation did not trigger at least some of the pleasure that occurs during reproductive sex then people would not do it.\n\n There is a long list of things that humans across the globe do on a daily basis that does not require a \"pleasurable feeling\"...\n \n \n \nI don't think I agree with this. An instinctual negative reaction doesn't predict that people don't overcome that reaction with reason and logic and decide that they believe in equal rights. It's the same reason people can say that they don't agree with what you say but they believe in your right to say it.\n\n Taking what you said for a minute, CAN people \"overcome that reaction\" as you say?\n To a greater degree, the answer is no.\n \n If it were so easily \"overcome\", as society changes there would be a unilateral change across the age spectrum. But the fact that the YOUNGER generation changes, but the OLDER generation MAINTAINS their prejudices, shows it isn't something \"overcome\" in the manner you describe.\n \n It's not \"instinctual\" at all.\n \n Further proof of that is examining multiple societies which had religious beliefs WHICH DID NOT CONDEMN GAYS, and observe that they in fact accepted homosexuals. Rome. Greeks. Native American Indian tribes.\n If it was \"instinctual\", it would transcend religion across societies.\n But it doesn't.\n \n Negative reaction to homosexuality is not \"instinctual\".\n It's learned behavior.\n \n \n \nAlso: the only indoctrination that is happening on a societal level is acceptance of homosexuals. That's the reason for any \"social shift\" you see, imo.\n\n Schools are being made to ensure that homosexuals are not mistreated.\n While I admit there are some that do more towards \"acceptance\", by and large the lesson is simply one of respecting people's civil rights. Do not harass. Do not bully.\n Society's repetitive lesson, from adult to child, of harassing and condemning homosexuals is being interrupted.\n \n There is no \"indoctrination\" as you speak of. Definitely not on the nation-wide level required to affect the change that we see.\n \n Another fact poking a hole in your claim is examining the difference between \"people who know a gay person\" and \"people who don't know a gay person\".\n By your approach, where \"instinct\" causes people to have an inherent \"negative reaction\", should there be a change?\n The fact that there knowing a gay person makes a body MORE LIKELY TO ACCEPT gays also shoots a hole in your theories.\n \n \n \nActually this reinforces my point. \n Having children is an instinctual desire which has been programmed into us due to evolutionary pressures. The fact that homosexual couples are incapable of having children yet retain this programming gives evidence that homosexual desire is an aberration, not a variant of human evolution in its own right. Whether genetic or environmental, the sexual desire was skewed while retaining the general evolutionary programming to procreate.\n\n You're completely ignoring my point and not \"reinforcing\" anything but rather accepting your own premise as true to declare \"conflict\".\n \n It's like saying \"The sun rises in the east cause a blond child leaves the house first in the morning.\"\n But when a brunette leaves first, you declare that proof of the brunette's \"aberrance\".\n Your analysis is lacking in logic! \n \n \n \nProcreation should be a desire no matter what other aberrations or mutations occur since reproduction is the only method to pass on those traits. The desire doesn't really exist to better the species, but to promote the survival of it's own brand of genetic code, which would mean children. Any mutation that has no procreation desire would not survive long.\n\n I think you're missing a major point of evolution here.\n You claim \"survival of its own brand of genetic code\" is supreme, but compare a group of Wogs.\n Wog group A procreates like bunnies. They produce 12 children per pregnancy, but 10 of them get eaten by predators.\n Wog group B procreates at a slower pace with only six. But Wog group B practices better group survival and protects their children, ergo only two get eaten by predators.\n \n Wog group B has just increased their survivability by twice that of group A by a mechanism you discount as irrelevant!\n \n \n \nIf homosexuals were found to not have any of the same instinctual imperatives associated with mating (which makes up the bulk of instinctual reactions, one way or another) then it would mean one of two things: either sexual desire and instinctual reproduction are caused by the same environmental/genetic marker or that homosexuals are a separate variant in human evolution.\n\n If such a thing were true, you would just claim it as further proof of \"mutation\"...\n \n \n \nInteresting theory, but with no evidence that this occurred in hunter-gatherer societies where this evolution would have occurred.\n\n What kind of \"evidence\" would you want to look for in the first place?\n And moreover, I didn't just make up that theory. It's something that exists in the contexts of evaluating gays and evolution.\n You are too quick to discount anything that isn't \"procreation\" as irrelevant, when an evolutionary examination requires a more in depth analysis.\n \n \n \nYou're talking about modern society, not instincts that would have evolved far from anything resembling modern society. The hunter-gatherer society is driven by heterosexual attraction and reproduction and the social strategies developed to facilitate those desires.\n\n Why do you keep insisting on this having to be \"instinctual\"?\n If something provides an evolutionary benefit without being \"instinctual\", it's still an evolutionary benefit.\n There is no reason to require \"instinct\" other than that is what you are fixated on.\n \n \n \nThis is actually an interesting phenomenon but isn't contradictory to this theory.\n One explanation is that it is an example of how homosexuality exists somewhat outside of what our instincts can adequately explain and so would normally trigger an instinctual stigma. To a (heterosexual) man a woman is related intrinsically to sex. When she is attracted to another man then this triggers emotions and reactions that have evolved to deal with this type of social situation. When she is attracted to a woman these same reactions do not occur since the other woman is also related intrinsically to sex. This confuses any gut level avoidance that would normally occur and simply gives the reaction of two sexual stimulations.\n\n Do you realize how much you just changed your working theory from apples to oranges?\n Before, you were talking about COUPLE type reactions to how they would see another individual not \"procreating\".\n NOW you shifted focus to what can best be described as a pseudo \"jealousy\" explanation.\n \n So a woman, contradicting her \"instinctual\" action of procreating with a man, is still \"related intrinsically\" to sex?\n But another man, doing the same thing, is somehow different?\n \n The only confusion here is in the argument to try to explain away the phenomenon.\n \n \n \nAnother possibility is that it seems more masturbatory than anything else; that the sex is not \"really\" sex between two people.\n\n And the same thing would exist for two guys.\n A man could just as easily think the two guys were just \"masturbatory\".\n In fact, there are cultures that DO view male-male sex as more recreational, while women are EXCLUSIVELY procreational. More as owned...\n \n This is all LEARNED behavior. Not \"instinctual\".\n \n \n \nWomen masturbating are sexually stimulating to heterosexual men and having what essentially amounts to two women masturbating is simply twice as stimulating to the man with nothing else associating it to instinctual avoidance. Even using toys to penetrate each other would seem to be a heterosexual masturbatory method since anything penetrating a woman would be instinctually and necessarily a male-female type contact anyway.\n\n It is more and more obvious that NON-procreational acts which are accepted are automatically, with no real logic, classified as \"heterosexual\" just to try to get them out of the discussion...\n \n \n \nI think this is where most people have their gut level avoidance. While heterosexual relationships give instinctual understanding and agreement, homosexual relationships run counter to those instincts. To many people, imo, heterosexual relationships deserve more consideration that homosexual relationships since they are the basis upon which every and all evolution of the species does and has depended.\n\n That's an interesting idea, except there is a majority in America that think that gays should have every right and privilege that comes with marriage.\n Currently, most want it under a different name. But that distinction is shrinking to the minority...\n \n \n \nNothing physically prevents him, certainly, but being available for sex (which means enjoying it enough to do it) would limit the amount of straying a man might do in search of sex. In fact the male's instinctual desire is to have children by a variety of women, while a woman's instinctual desire is to find a man that has the resources to care for her and her children. These are conflicting desires since the woman would then want to keep all of the man's resources (his attention, social standing, money, whatever) to give her children the best chance of survival and so must develop strategies to prevent the man from seeking other woman. Lying, detecting lies, suspicion, trust, etc evolved as social strategies for social situations such as these.\n\n You recognize the RELATIONSHIP benefits to sex when it comes to a heterosexual couple...\n But for a gay couple, it's just thrown out the window...\n \n \n \nNot really. The ultimate \"goal\" of evolution is to maximize the number of children that will reliably survive to have children of their own, and virtually any desire a person has arose to facilitate that purpose.\n\n No. You are wrong.\n You are inserting your own preconditions into that statement.\n The ultimate \"goal\" of evolution is survivability.\n If that \"survivability\" is best met with a litter, then a litter comes about.\n If that \"survivability\" is best met with fewer children and more intensive observation, then that comes out.\n \n You are assuming that \"survivability\" requires \"maximizing the number of children\", which is false.\n \n \n \nThe link you gave gives a more granular view than what I'm giving to you here.\n\n No. It gave a broader view. You gave a narrow view on one aspect, and started assuming things based on the false premise that there was ONLY the \"narrow view\" you were looking at...\n \n \n \nA perhaps more appropriate view is this Gene-centered_view_of_evolution\n\n I rephrased your link to show EXACTLY what you had done.\n Instead of addressing my link which addressed the BROAD SPECTRUM of psychological evolution, you want to look ONLY at \"gene centered view of evolution\".\n That's like refusing to address the fact that the digestive system is a part of the body by fixating on the lungs.\n \n \n \nThe result is that \"the prevalent genes in a sexual population must be those that, as a mean condition, through a large number of genotypes in a large number of situations, have had the most favourable phenotypic effects for their own replication.\" (Williams, 1985) In other words, we expect selfish genes, \"selfish\" meaning that promotes its own survival without necessarily promoting the survival of the organism, group or even species. This theory implicates that adaptations are the phenotypic effects of genes to maximize their representation in the future generations. An adaptation is maintained by selection if it promotes genetic survival directly or some subordinate goal that ultimately contributes to successful reproduction.\n An adaption is only successful if it contributes to reproduction in some way. The link you gave describes strategies that are developed to satisfy this imperative.\n\n Taking what you quoted, THINK about what I have talked about.\n Homosexuality has a genetic component. On that there is no real doubt.\n Homosexuality has also been shown to be more prevalent in younger brothers with more older brothers.\n \n Taking the quote above, wouldn't your approach logically think that the large families without younger gay brothers would win out, and the families producing younger gay brothers would have \"evolution\" eliminate them?\n Except evolution PROVIDES THE BENEFIT I was talking about earlier.\n \n YOU want to fixate on \"genetic\" evolution, WITHOUT RECOGNIZING that there are OTHER TYPES of evolution which also impact the situation.",

However, I said: Manual stimulation must engage the senses and reactions that evolved to facilitate heterosexual sex since the pleasurable feeling that occurs exists because it facilitates reproductive sex.

Rome. Greeks. Native American Indian tribes. If it was \"instinctual\", it would transcend religion across societies. But it doesn't.\n\n \n I don't really think those examples support your argument. In Greek and Roman culture, masculinity was associated with penetrative roles. Women, youths and slaves were considered feminine. There was no relationship of equals, since being penetrated would make one feminine and a social subordinate.\n \n From here\n Given the importance in Greek society of cultivating the masculinity of the adult male and the perceived feminizing effect of being the passive partner, relations between adult men of comparable social status were considered highly problematic, and usually associated with social stigma. However, examples of such couples are occasionally found in the historical record\n \n Even in societys such as these, male-female is the standard by which relationships are measured.\n \n \nAnother fact poking a hole in your claim is examining the difference between \"people who know a gay person\" and \"people who don't know a gay person\". By your approach, where \"instinct\" causes people to have an inherent \"negative reaction\", should there be a change? The fact that there knowing a gay person makes a body MORE LIKELY TO ACCEPT gays also shoots a hole in your theories.\n\n \n When you want to claim that something shoots holes in this theory I would appreciate if you specify how. I do think you can believe in equal rights for people while still having an instintual negative reaction to homosexual relationships.\n \n \nI think you're missing a major point of evolution here.

Both of these strategies to maximize your reproductive potential are valid.\n \n \nAnd the same thing would exist for two guys. A man could just as easily think the two guys were just \"masturbatory\".\n\n \n In some sense I think it is viewed simply as masturbatory and not as a real relationship, but that sex is real since there is or can be penetration with the penis.\n \n However, there is no attraction, even to women in general, in masturbating men (playgirl, the supposed playboy equivalent, is not marketed to women). \n \n \nIt is more and more obvious that NON-procreational acts which are accepted are automatically, with no real logic, classified as \"heterosexual\" just to try to get them out of the discussion...\n\n \n I think we are reaching the point that we will have to agree to disagree.

You seem to say that homosexual reaction to societal prejudice would be different than non-homosexual reaction to societal prejudice.\n\n \n The problem is you will compare homphobic prejudice to a reluctance to accept harmful disorders such as pedophilia. That's just nonsense. There are so many differences, the fact that there are a smaller number of people practicing these things, compared to heterosexuality, doesn't make them the same. \n \n The pedophile can be made to understand that it's a disease that can lead to committing anti-social acts. There is no reason homosexuality should not be as celebrated as heterosexuality. We know homophobia is unjust, which is why society is changing toward acceptance. The gay person will sense the complete injustice of his or her situation, marginalization. Thankfully this is improving. There is a different social reality here, which will cause a different response. \n \n We may well work at our treatment of pedophiles, and have \"pity\" for them as you say, but if we don't, this doesn't make accepting gay people a bad thing, anymore than it makes accepting heterosexuality a bad thing. That's a different debate. \n \n \nI'm sorry, but this doesn't seem to relate at all to what I said.

Yet, sexual pleasure occurs with non-reproductive sex and gay sex. Would so many animal species have gay sex if it were not higly pleasurable? \n \n \nI didn't say it was easy or hard, only that the fact that is instinctual does not mean that it is inevitible or unchangable.\n\n \n I don't think it's instinctual, because it does change over cultures and times. Also, it isn't present among other animals, including our close relatives.\n \n \nI don't really think those examples support your argument. In Greek and Roman culture, masculinity was associated with penetrative roles. Women, youths and slaves were considered feminine. There was no relationship of equals, since being penetrated would make one feminine and a social subordinate.\n\n \n That's socially constructing things though, in both the case of homosexuality and of heterosexuality. It was very much a war-like patriarchy. It was all about making people perform roles of dominant and submissive.\n \n \nEven in societys such as these, male-female is the standard by which relationships are measured.\n\n \n Again, social standards are not necessarily the final word on natural order, or law.\n \n \nThat's exactly what I mean. Most people have the instinctual reaction that heterosexual relationships are somehow \"special\" for reasons they cannot articulate. I have outlined the basis for that reaction, though you do not accept it.\n \n \n \n What? I have said no such thing.

There is no need for having a lot of reproduction in the most stable society, or in the absense of predators. Limiting reproduction can also have a benefit, to help us survive and thrive without using up all our resources. Humans do this to an incredible degree. So to say an anti-gay instinct comes about by a fear of not reproducing, and then ignore the heterosexual couples not reproducing, doesn't make sense. You can say the straight couples are mimicking heterosexuality, perhaps more. But heterosexuality and homosexuality are socially contructed terms. Claiming a higher \"purpose\" for heterosexuality is very subjective. Everything contributes to the natural world in its own way.\n \n Sigma, you said that survival without reproduction is an evolutionary dead end. It's equally true that reproduction without survival is an evolutionary dead end. Why should reproduction itself be held up as \"special\" above survival?",

I could just as easily say: the problem is you would compare prejudice against pedophila to a reluctance to accept harmful disorders such as homsexuality. \n \n You have a preconceived notion that the desire of pedophila is harmful in and of itself (or a disease in and of itself). The very same thing is thought of homosexuality, which this study seeks to disprove. Your thoughts and words here reflect the very same prejudice that those you deride express.\n \n \nThere is no reason homosexuality should not be as celebrated as heterosexuality. We know homophobia is unjust, which is why society is changing toward acceptance.\n\n \n There are reasons, as I have outlined in my posts to foundit66.

The answer is: They wouldn't.\n \n Pleasure during homosexual encounters occurs because pleasure facilitates reproductive sex. If it did not encourage reproductive sex, there would be no reason for that trait to be selected for in evolution.\n \n \nI don't think it's instinctual, because it does change over cultures and times. Also, it isn't present among other animals, including our close relatives.\n [..]\n That's socially constructing things though, in both the case of homosexuality and of heterosexuality. It was very much a war-like patriarchy. It was all about making people perform roles of dominant and submissive.\n\n \n It doesn't change as much as you seem to think, as shown in the examples I gave. The \"roles\" are instinctual roles grounded in the male-female reproductive roles.\n \n \nAgain, social standards are not necessarily the final word on natural order, or law.\n\n \n Of course not. Instincts guide social standards, not the other way around. Whether it makes it into law is beyond the scope of my argument. I'm explaining why I believe that resistance against homosexual people is grounded in instinctual feelings about what is \"natural\" and \"right\". Whether this is good or bad or whether it should be legally enforced is beyond the point.\n \n It is like being suddenly confronted with a group of people who drink urine instead of water. It goes so basically against instincts that evolved to serve a certain and essential purpose that there is a gut level avoidance towards that group of people.\n \n \nIt's not just having offspring, but having them survive. Also, the environment. There is no need for having a lot of reproduction in the most stable society, or in the absense of predators. Limiting reproduction can also have a benefit, to help us survive and thrive Without using up all our resources. Humans do this to an incredible degree.\n\n \n Every animal would do this, given the chance. When farmers kill wolves, deer breed out of control. Their instincts drive them to reproduce more and more because that's how they evolved.\n \n Genes don't look at what's best for society, or the species or even the individual per se. They \"want\" to propagate even to the detriment of everything else. You can regularly see adaptations that actually reduce the survivability of the individual but increase their ability to reproduce. Children (and their survival to have children of their own) is the ultimate \"goal\" of evolution.\n \n \nSo to say an anti-gay instinct comes about by a fear of not reproducing, and then ignore the heterosexual couples not reproducing, doesn't make sense.\n\n \n A fear of not reproducing? I've never said that and it isn't true either.\n \n Let me try to explain. Reproductive sex and heterosexual desire sort of go hand in hand. However, while they are directly related to each other they do not require each other to exist. So, then, non-reproductive sex with heterosexual desire still is related to reproductive sex.\n \n \nYou can say the straight couples are mimicking heterosexuality, perhaps more. But heterosexuality and homosexuality are socially contructed terms. Claiming a higher \"purpose\" for heterosexuality is very subjective. Everything contributes to the natural world in its own way.\n\n \n Yes, in the sense that man-made structures are part of the natural world because everything that went into their construction originated in the natural world. You sort of empty the \"natural world\" concept of meaning with that use.\n \n While heterosexuality has an undisputed purpose where homosexuality does not, you are very very right that the significance is subjective! That has been part of my point all along. The prejudice that occurs is do, imo, to people assigning at least some significance to their instinctual desire for the opposite sex. It is the feeling that heterosexual desire deserves some consideration for being the vehicle for any and all evolution of the species. Whether this is right or not is subjective, but then again so is all prejudice so you really gain no ground by that discovery.\n \n \nSigma, you said that survival without reproduction is an evolutionary dead end. It's equally true that reproduction without survival is an evolutionary dead end. Why should reproduction itself be held up as \"special\" above survival?\n\n \n You're wrong here. If a species only survives long enough to produce each new generation it is a success.\n \n Reproduction is instinctually special to most people, I'd wager. Just how special is a subjective determination, though. I don't think there is anything intrinsically wrong with this feeling.",

   "Your words belie your prejudice. I could just as easily say: the problem is you would compare prejudice against pedophila to a reluctance to accept harmful disorders such as homsexuality.\n\n It's not \"prejudice\" but rather just plain fact.\n And you can't try to turn the phrase around, cause homosexuality DOES NOT HARM anybody.\n \n \n \nYou have provided nothing to further the discussion.\n\n Actually, he has.\n He also provided that study a few posts ago that I felt was incredibly helpful. I really think you need to review and respond to it.\n I stopped responding cause I thought Jake could make some headways, cause you are repeatedly showing you don't get what I am saying.\n \n \n \nSee above. You have a preconceived notion that the desire of pedophila is harmful in and of itself (or a disease in and of itself). The very same thing is thought of homosexuality, which this study seeks to disprove. Your thoughts and words here reflect the very same prejudice that those you deride express.\n\n A homosexual acting upon his desire results in something like a homosexual relationship or homosexual sex.\n A pedophile acting upon his desire results in child rape.\n \n What Jake said simply reflects that simple fact!\n \n \n \nThere is no reason homosexuality should not be as celebrated as heterosexuality. We know homophobia is unjust, which is why society is changing toward acceptance.\n\n \nThere are reasons, as I have outlined in my posts to foundit66. Whether you think them valid is a subjective determination. Prejudice against pedophiliac or zoophiliac desire is unjust, even if molestation is unacceptable.\n\n I would have to say that you are wrong in your response.\n You have given an explanation as to why you claim INSTINCTUALLY homosexuals are not treated as heterosexuals.\n But Jake talked about REASON, which is above and beyond blind instinct. And quite frankly, a lot of your explanation just seemed to boil down to ordinary prejudice over somebody else doing something different.\n You think \"instinct\" can handle individuals choosing to not procreate and to not indulge in procreative activity for a variety of reasons.\n But the \"gay\" one is, for no consistent reason, the one that is the odd man out.\n \n That is not \"reason\".\n When it comes to \"reason\", the situation is people prejudiced against apples vs recognizing that if the orange is allowed to do what the orange wants to do, a child is harmed.\n \n \n \nA better question: Why would any animal species have sex at all if it were not pleasurable? The answer is: They wouldn't.\n\n Animals do all sorts of things for all sorts of different reasons.\n Apes can socialize, but it doesn't elicit sexual pleasure.\n You keep assuming that the existence of the carrot justifies the assumption that it has to be associated with juice.\n It can also go in a salad, or a variety of other uses.\n \n \n \nPleasure during homosexual encounters occurs because pleasure facilitates reproductive sex. If it did not encourage reproductive sex, there would be no reason for that trait to be selected for in evolution.\n\n So WHY do OLDER couples who cannot reproduce get together?\n I mean cognitively, they KNOW they can't reproduce, right?\n By your thinking, the joining of an elderly couple serves no purpose.\n \n The fact that it DOES serve MULTIPLE purposes demonstrates the flaw in your argument. There are many advantages to pairing off of animals independent of \"procreation\".\n \n \n \nIt doesn't change as much as you seem to think, as shown in the examples I gave.\n\n Do you even know what you're talking about with the context of this statement?\n If you follow the thread back, this comment line is discussing the prejudice against gays, and your claims that it is \"instinct\".\n And you are VERY WRONG in that it DOES change easily.\n It does NOT exist independently across all cultural lines, which is what you would expect if something was truly \"instinctual\".\n \n \n \nOf course not. Instincts guide social standards, not the other way around.\n\n I repeatedly think you commit logical fallacies of assumed exclusivity, where none is present.\n Instincts CAN affect social standards, but they do not always do so. Sometimes, it's just plain learned, passed on from generation to generation.\n I think one clear means of observing the difference is in seeing how a \"social standard\" can change.\n \n If the social standard breaks from one generation to another, and a huge generation gap exists on the issue, that's \"learned\".\n If the social standard can be departed from ACROSS the generation line, as different generations independently evaluate their \"instinct\", then that's more of a \"instinctual\" issue.\n The generation gap on the gay issue shows a clear trend for \"learned\" behavior.\n \n \n \nIt is like being suddenly confronted with a group of people who drink urine instead of water. It goes so basically against instincts that evolved to serve a certain and essential purpose that there is a gut level avoidance towards that group of people.\n\n No.\n The whole \"urine\" and \"feces\" issue is NOT instinctual, but entirely learned. Ingrained in from parents who tell their infants that it's bad to go poo in the pants, and good to do it on the toilet.\n \n \n \nEvery animal would do this, given the chance. When farmers kill wolves, deer breed out of control. Their instincts drive them to reproduce more and more because that's how they evolved.\n\n That's a fairly irrelevant supply.\n Just because animals are prone to over-populate does not address OTHER mechanisms that are present to limit over-population while still providing benefit to the species.\n Your approach is like insisting that the body is designed to take in substance, while ignoring the mechanisms present to remove the waste substance from the body.\n \n \n \nGenes don't look at what's best for society, or the species or even the individual per se. They \"want\" to propagate even to the detriment of everything else.\n\n AGAIN you keep fixating on this at a \"genetic\" level.\n You need to stop and realize that there are OTHER POINTS to evolution.\n \n \n \nChildren (and their survival to have children of their own) is the ultimate \"goal\" of evolution.\n\n How many times do we have to explain that homosexuality ENHANCES child survivability?\n \n \n \nA fear of not reproducing? I've never said that and it isn't true either.\n\n I think Jake has hit on something fundamental.\n You claim an \"aversion\" at an \"instinctual\" level. Fear would be the typical causes of instinctual aversion.\n Are you trying to argue it's just a matter of them not liking something that's different?\n That's not instinctual aversion.\n \n \n \nLet me try to explain. Reproductive sex and heterosexual desire sort of go hand in hand. However, while they are directly related to each other they do not require each other to exist. So, then, non-reproductive sex with heterosexual desire still is related to reproductive sex.\n\n This is the fundamental logical flaw that many encounter in trying to justify anti-gay hostility.\n They can't account for the fact that other forms of \"non-reproductive sex\" are just plain ignored by modern society.\n They try to give casual excuses for it, like you trying to claim that \"masturbation\" is somehow heterosexual sex, but it just fails casual review.\n The claim makes no sense.\n \n \n \nWhile heterosexuality has an undisputed purpose where homosexuality does not, you are very very right that the significance is subjective!\n\n I don't understand how you can claim it is \"undisputed\", and then admit it is \"subjective\".\n Furthermore, the purpose of homosexuality, in an evolutionary setting, has been explained to you repeatedly.\n \n \n [quote=JakeCJB]Sigma, you said that survival without reproduction is an evolutionary dead end. It's equally true that reproduction without survival is an evolutionary dead end. Why should reproduction itself be held up as \"special\" above survival?\n \nYou're wrong here. If a species only survives long enough to produce each new generation it is a success.\n\n I high-lighted Jake's quote to demonstrate the flaw in you claiming he is \"wrong\".\n Jake talks about reproduction without survival, and then you claim he is wrong while making a statement that includes a requirement FOR SURVIVAL.\n \n \n \nReproduction is instinctually special to most people, I'd wager. Just how special is a subjective determination, though. I don't think there is anything intrinsically wrong with this feeling.\n\n Nobody is saying that the desire to have kids is \"intrinsically wrong\".\n As I pointed out, the fact that gays ALSO have this desire, as their sexual desires are pointed towards the same gender, demonstrates an inherent flaw in your thinking.\n \n You claim that the \"instinct\" to have kids is so tied to heterosexual desire, that it would seem obvious that if one was changed, the other would be affected.\n But that is NOT the case for homosexuals, which should tell you something...",

   "\n Trying to isolate one thing, such as direct popping out of babies, and saying that IS the complex process of evolution in a nutshell, and homosexuality or other factors are aberrations, is just false.

I can easily accept that this might be one factor at least that explains the biological existence of, what shall I call it, the \"gay instinct\".\n \n I wonder, however, whether it is sufficient to explain the existence of gay people (and other animals) completely. Homoeroticism may have other social functions as well, and thus could also be a positive adaptation, provided it does not inhibit reproduction.

Further, lots of gay men aren't really Kinsey 6s -- they could be 4s or 5s, which indicates a degree of heterosexual behaviour.\n \n We tend to oversimplify human sexuality because its complexity alarms some folk, and it's easier to think in simple dichotomies. I suspect that if we think of most people as being either exclusively gay or straight, while a handful are supposedly bisexuals, then we may stand a poor chance of understanding the biology of homosexuality. At any rate, at present, I don't think biologists have an answer, though they have begun to ask some interesting questions in ways that can be tested.",

This only occurs through sexual reproduction which homosexuals obviously do not engage in. \n \n Sexual selection for genes that allow for something like, say, a grandmother moving in and taking care of children while the parents, who are more capable since they are younger, hunt for food can reasonably arise since all members that are involved in that type of behavior have reproduced to pass on the inclination for cooperation. Pairs of males, even if they enjoy enhanced individual survival, will not pass on the genes that allow for that behavior.

Since homosexual desire runs counter to evolutionary \"progression\" (if it can so be called), only those with little of this desire can pass on their genetic traits. Therefore those who are entirely homosexual are aberrations that, in the wild, would be bred out of the population as negative adaptations.\n \n However, in light of the study provided it could be that homosexuals are a byproduct of a beneficial adaptations in the female members of the family.
