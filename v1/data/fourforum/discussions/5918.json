Some people might take this to say that this means homosexual sex is unhealthy because of the greater risk of contracting STDs. The fact of rising STD rates is used to justify the claim that homosexual sex in general is unhealthy.\n \n Using such a fact to make such a claim seems to be pernicious because doing so goes beyond what might be reasonably inferred from such a fact. And going beyond what might be reasonably inferred from a fact suggests that the claimant is either stupid or deliberately trying to mislead readers.\n \n Obviously where a gay person is monogamous or does not have sex with other people that have STDs, the issue of rising STD rates is beside the point in evaluating how healthy or unhealthy those homosexuals acts are. Seeing as not all gay men engage in risky sexual activity, there cannot be something about gay sex itself that contributes to the rise in STD rates and a stronger inference would be that risky homosexual sex is unhealthy.",

   "Well, the reason for that is marketing. Most organizations aren't going to advertise on a gay website unless their primary market for their product or service is homosexuals. Since \"homosexuals\" is by nature a group of people who are sexually attracted to members of the same sex, those organizations which produce products aimed at a homosexual audience are generally organizations that produce sexual products and who advertise using sexual ads. Furthermore, even if a non-sex-related product is being advertised, people know the advertisement they are putting up is going to be on a gay-themed website, and they design their ads in a way they imagine will appeal to gay people.\n \n 365gay.com has those sorts of advertisements because people pay them money to post those advertisements, and without that money, they couldn't afford to keep the site running.\n \n For an example of a gay rights website without advertising, take a look at www.hrc.org",
