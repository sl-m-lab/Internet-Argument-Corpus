How can you possibly reconcile this with Christianity? Jesus said that you should give up all your posessions and that only the poor can achieva salvation.",

I thought that maybe some Americans molded themselves into a mirror image of communism/Soviet Union. Since the communists were atheists and against free market, maybe they thought that being a theist means being for the free market. So they started worshiping it as an idol. But the prosperity theology originated already in the 19. century. So this theory does not completely explain it.",
