   "Abduction interrupted\n Oakland Hills home invasion ends in shootout; women safe; police seek suspect\n By J.M. BROWN/Times-Herald staff writer\n \n A masked man abducted an Oakland Hills woman and her maid at gunpoint Friday before driving the pair to a Vallejo marsh, where authorities speculate he was about to kill them when a property caretaker interrupted the crime. \n The suspect had just forced one of the women to lie down in a ditch when the caretaker, armed with a shotgun for protection against thieves, arrived around 2 p.m., authorities said. The suspect and caretaker exchanged shots before the suspect sped away in the Oakland woman's Lexus sport-utility vehicle. \n \n No one was hit, and the women were not injured, though they had been bound and gagged. Tape could still be seen around one woman's neck as investigators questioned her at the Highway 37 scene. \n \n The suspect had unsuccessfully robbed the women, and authorities suspect he was trying to find an isolated spot to kill them. \n \n \"I don't know why else he would take her over there and make her lie in the ditch,\" Sheriff's Sgt. Jeff Brackett said. \n \n The shaken-up caretaker, Doug Paul of Vallejo, said: \"I think he was doing something bad. It's pretty f---ed up to have a woman gagged and bound.\" \n \n Authorities are on the lookout for the dark gray 2006 Lexus RX 400H Hybrid with California license plate number VMSUSS. The suspect is described as a large white man, at least 6 feet tall and 200 pounds. He was wearing a tank top, black gloves and possibly blue jeans. \n Authorities ask anyone who spots the vehicle to call 9-1-1 or the Solano County Sheriff's Dispatch at 421-7090. Because the suspect is considered armed and dangerous, authorities warn anyone who sees the vehicle not to approach it or the suspect. \n \n After interviewing the women and caretaker, Brackett said this is what investigators believe happened: \n \n The suspect allegedly invaded the upscale Oakland home in the first block of Sheridan Road and demanded cash from the 44-year-old homeowner and her 29-year-old maid. The women told authorities they do not know the man. \n \n Armed with a gun and knife, the suspect handcuffed them at the wrists and ankles, and taped their mouths with clear packing-style tape. He then forced the women into the Lexus and drove around for several hours, saying little to them. \n \n He did not say he intended to kill them, but at one point said he might seek a ransom for the older woman. That leads detectives to wonder if he knew the woman or her husband. \n \n The suspect pulled into a parking lot off westbound Highway 37 north of Wilson Avenue in unincorporated Vallejo. Leaving the maid in the vehicle, he led the homeowner into the adjacent marsh and forced her to lie down in a ditch behind a berm. \n \n Just then, the caretaker and a friend pulled into the lot to conduct the weekly check on the property. The maid got out of the Lexus and screamed for help. \n \n As the caretaker and friend were talking to the maid, the suspect emerged from behind 12-foot high weeds and ran toward the Lexus. The caretaker fired a warning shot to stop the suspect from fleeing, and the suspect fired three shots before taking off. \n \n The caretaker told the Times-Herald he dodged the suspect's bullets buy ducking in front of his car. \n \n \"It was amazing I wasn't shot,\" the caretaker said. \"At that time I was counting my blessings.\" \n \n As Paul was calling 9-1-1 from his cell phone, his friend, identified only as Roger, followed the suspect into Vallejo. The suspect fired at least one shot before Roger lost site of the vehicle. \n \n The 49-year-old Paul, who said he watches the property for The Oasis Corporation, wiped tears away as he recalled the bizarre incident. Paul said he arms himself because his mobile home at the site is frequently burglarized. \n \n \"This has never been a safe piece of property,\" Paul said. \n \n Although Paul said he feels lucky to have arrived in time to save the women from the suspect, he said, \"Being at the right place at the right time would have been when this a--hole was born.\" \n http://www.timesheraldonline.com/ci_4567700\n \n do people realy beleve the kind of criminal who comits these crimes would not use a gun if they were banned?",
