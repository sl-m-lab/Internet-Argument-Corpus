He added that police and security forces attached to the Interior Ministry are responsible for most abuses.\n\n note that this is the head of the Human Right Ministry speaking. he condemns these events. was this ever possible under Saddam?\n \n\"We've documented a lot of torture cases,\" said Sultan, whose committee is pushing for wider access to Iraqi-run prisons across the nation. \"There are beatings, punching, electric shocks to the body, including sensitive areas, hanging prisoners upside down and beating them and dragging them on the ground.... Many police officers come from a culture of torture from their experiences over the last 35 years. Most of them worked during Saddam's regime.\"\n\n and he blames them on hold over ideologies of the saddam regimes. you cannot change the mentality of a people over night.\n and so what was the Interior Ministry respond?\n \nThe Interior Ministry, responsible for the nation's internal security, acknowledges cases of mistreatment but denies that torture is common. Interior Minister Bayan Jabr is a Shiite Muslim, and some Sunni Muslim tribal leaders and politicians have accused the ministry of unfairly targeting Sunnis, who make up the bulk of the insurgency.\n \n \"There are no official accusations that the ministry's forces are carrying out widespread abuse and torture of detainees,\" said Col. Adnan Joubouri, a ministry spokesman. \"There was some abuse of authority, and those officials responsible are being punished.\"\n\n and since you brought up the US\n \n\"We understand and we hear that [torture] is potentially happening, and this is an issue we are constantly talking about,\" said a senior U.S. military official in Baghdad. \"I think this is an issue no one can afford to ignore.\"\n\n and what do the other iraqis say?\n \n\"The Americans are occupying the country, but the Iraqi national guard and Iraqi police are violating the human rights of detainees,\" said Sattar Raouf, director of the Popular Committee for Culture and Arts, who has followed allegations of abuse. \"Intelligence and security forces are torturing people for confessions. You can go to the sixth and seventh floors of the Interior Ministry and find case after case like this.\"\n ...\n Guheithi, the Sunni imam, has been detained by American as well as Iraqi forces. He said U.S. troops had arrested him in January 2004 and accused him of preaching holy war at his mosque. He said he was held in solitary confinement for seven days and released. American soldiers, he said, \"didn't torture me, but an Iraqi man with them punched me hard several times.\"\n\n \n the iraqi military/police culture has a penchant for torture aquired from the days of saddam. the iraqi government officials do not like this, have spoken out against this, and aim to correct it.\n is there a problem with torture in iraq by iraqi? yes\n is it as bad as it was under saddam? no\n are they ignoring it? no\n \n no, we did not build paradise on top of hell in 2 years. it take time.\n this does not invalidate the humanitarian reasons for the war.\n \n the enemy of good is perfect",

   "Articles about alledged torture should always be read with skepticism.\n \n Under Hussein, the minority Sunnis were the core of the ruling Baath Party and controlled the country. The new Iraqi government is dominated by Shiites, who make up the majority of Iraq's population. Each side blames the other for the bloodshed. This dynamic poses an incendiary possibility: Accounts of torture in detention given by Sunni extremists might have been fabricated or embellished to help instigate a civil war against Shiites and the government. The Human Rights Ministry says it has encountered made-up allegations of abuse.\n \n \"Ninety percent of detainees say that they confessed under torture,\" said Judge Luqman Thabit Samiraii, head of the 1st Iraqi Central Criminal Court. \"Yet 80% of them have no torture marks. But torture does exist during interrogations, I admit that.\"\n \n Torture and mistreatment unfortunately accompany control in a detention system. The detainees are almosty always subjected to some form of punishment resulting from the sadistic tendencies of guards and interrogators. This happens on some scale in most if not all cases.\n \n Also, when the detainees are released, the story they tell is likely to be stronger than the actual punishment. It's easy to say \"they beat me\" when all that happened may have been a slap on the backside.
