   "Here is another edition of my yearly US Financial Report discussion. \n \n You can find this glorious report here: U.S. GAO - 2010 Financial Report of the United States Government\n \n How odd that the federal government regulates companies to get audited financial statements so people can see if companies are up to no good yet the federal government consistently cannot get an opinion on their financial statements due to incompetence at so many agencies. \n \n Anyway,\n \n This year $2.2 trillion revenue and $4.2 trillion in cost. For those of you tracking that is a 25% increase in expense with a .82% increase in revenue. In fact, expenses are almost double revenues! So close.\n \n Reclaiming first place in cost was Defense who had a a 30% increase in expenses this year. Transportation increased 58%, Department of Labor 28%, and Education 133%. Defense, HHS, and SSA combined are MORE than our total revenue for the entire year. \n \n Maybe someone can chime in and show me a scenario that balance the budget.",

   "For the record, I do have a rough plan to balance the budget. Keep in mind this is rough as specifics would take too much effort to post here.\n \n Step 1: Cost Cuts\n in 2011 (or first year) cut 15%, second year cut 10% on top of that, third year cut 5% on top of that. These would be reduced if projected tax levels went up enough.\n \n Assuming 2010 numbers it would look something like this:\n 2011 - Expenses: $2,920.....Savings: $514 billion\n 2012 - Expenses: $2,628.....Savings: $292 billion\n 2013 - Expenses: $2,496.....Savings: $131 billion\n \n Step 2: Tax increases\n In 2011 taxes for those making $100k-250k would go up 2% and those making over $250k would go up 5%. This would increase revenue between 35-45 billion a year. Charge FICA taxes for incomes between 100k-250k (not currently done) but at a rate of 5% of AGI (total for SS and Medicare). Total revenue would increase by $135 billion or so. I would also keep the estate tax at 35% over estates over $5 million with some exceptions and rules. Hard to say what this would net. \n \n In 2013 estimated tax revenue could be $2,467 on an accrual basis (like the expense number). That would put us in the black. \n \n Naturally I would be open to doing this over more years or doing minor adjustments but overall I think it is a doable plan. States have made 15% cuts to agencies in THREE consecutive years so I am confident the federal government can do the same. Also of note, this would require many changes to laws and probably reductions in entitlement benefits. These would need to be passed in order to achieve this goal.\n \n Finally, this plan is admittedly extremely unfair to many people and almost everyone will get hurt by it and possibly cause the economy to sink for a bit. Nevertheless, I'm not sure how else you could get the government under control fiscally.",

I do not know of a single state or municipal entity that has not had to go back and correct, and in some cases by 30% or more, their long term budgets to address the new fiscal reality in America. \n \n When we talk about cutting federal spending, there is NO WAY that the private sector is going to pick up to cover those cuts. NO WAY. We are simply going to see economic contraction. Entire industries will be torn down and restructured.

An example I have off the top of my head was when I was looking at mammogram machines at a hospital here in VA. They had about 5 that looked about 1-2 years old sitting in a corner and each of the private rooms had a brand spanking new all digital, sings you a song and gives you a happy ending Mammogram machines. They certainly were nicer and a pretty cool advancement in technology over last years model but the chances of it detecting sooner or more accurately was marginal from what I'm told. The five old ones were being shipped to the UK at a substantial discount since the UK couldn't afford the cool new ones. This is not to mention the hundreds of other pieces of equipment that just sit around I noticed. Nevertheless, they certainly had the latest and greatest. Twice the cost and we discover cancers 4-5% better. Win!\n\n \n That is not getting more for your money. That is blowing money.",

Either it makes people healthier, in which case it is money well spent, or it does not, in which case it is a waste. The advances will be made regardless, but if we actually wait until we have made enough advancements that the new model actually provides health benefits over the old one, we are actually spending our money wisely instead of blowing it.",

For example the mammogram machince I referred to detected better than the old machines. It could literally color areas of risk from what I'm told. In other words, it had less \"human error\". The detection rate of breast cancer is better than in England. Is it twice the cost better? Ummm, probably not.\n \n I've noticed a few interesting trends since working with numerous private/government relationships. With pure government run, like UK healthcare, you get a cheap product at a cheap price. With government mostly paying but private providing the service, like the US healthcare system, you get a whole lot of new \"things\" at an extremely high price. Often times the system is dysfunctional. The third is private paying for private. Here you get exactly what is needed at the price the market is willing to pay. \n \n The middle category has numerous examples. One I deal with often is government funding research and educational grants to colleges (colleges act like private industry in this sense). It is basically an unlimited stream of money to do whatever you want. The result is the most complicated research buildings on the planet with the best equipment someone could dream of and scientific findings that have no relevance in growth of the economy. Now, contrast that to a private scientific lab providing services to a private entity (aka another company pays for it). Those are generally in a cheap one story building using equipment that does the job needed and nothing more. They are still nice facilities but instead of a having a $6 million robot carry a jar from one table to another you have a human do it. Finally, I've seen science labs where government runs the show and pays for it (the same government). The may be nice or they may be horrific. Generally you will see they have a 50yr old microscope but they get new laptops every year. \n \n Anyway, my point is that it isn't like we get nothing for our money, we just loss efficiency. The 6 million dollar robot probably was a engineering milestone but the market would have developed the same thing when it was actually needed sometime down the road. The US healthcare system is expensive for this very reason.",
