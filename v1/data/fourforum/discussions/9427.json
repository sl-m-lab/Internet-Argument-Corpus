   "The posters who feel the Theory of Evolution has no validity or is \"unscientific\" have various claims why such an overwhelming majority of scientists (and essentially all biologists) disagree with them.\n \n There are claims of bias, conspiracy, political correctness, etc., though I have yet to understand what would be the incentive to behave that way. In that hundreds or thousands of studies are submitted for acceptance by peer reviewed journals, the lowly junior scientist really can't make a name for herself by adding yet another confirmatory piece of information.\n \n Can you imagine if there was even a single, well-designed and executed piece of research that seemed to refute evolution? That researcher would be a rock star. Oh, certainly the ivory towers might initially pooh-pooh such an upstart. But time and time again, this sort of thing happens in all branches of science - and that is how ideas change about how the world works. Indeed, there is arguably a great incentive to buck the system. \n \n Why then is there not a single piece of research in a peer reviewed journal that supports ID or creationism?

The OP stats for the USA, I suspect, apply not to 'evolution' in se, but rather to the darwinian RMNS explanation for it. Whether that is the case or not, there is absolutely no law in science that a person doing a certain job has to pay more than lip service to any metaphysical postulate seemingly required for the job. If RC priests can spend their adult lives saying mass, hearing confessions, and buggering little boys, then its no big deal for biologists, let alone any other scientist, to just pay the required obsequities to RMNS, stuff it on a mental back-shelf, and just get on with what they do everyday.\n \n Those people who are truly committed psychologically to RMNS darwinism are those like P.Z. Myers, Richard Hoppe, Nick Manke(??), Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennet, et al, who constantly evangelise the notion everywhere they can, including message boards like this one, IIDB, Panda's Thumb, and others. And they are all committed atheists. Evangelical atheists. \n \n Whether or not you can accept this fact is of no moment to me.

Differential reproduction rates are the effect of superior adaptability in those cases where adaptation is necessitated by environmental circumstance. They \"direct\" nothing but statistical trends.\n\n \n Good: you accept that differential reproduction rates do direct statistical trends. In other words, however any given genetic trait arises in the gene pool, differential reproductive rates (aka NS) are at least partially responsible for their later distribution, extinction or ubiquity within the gene pool.\n \n This means that later, when another adaptive mutation occurs or is induced, it will happen to an organism that either A) already possesses the earlier adaptive trait itself, or B) is likely to mate (or have descendents who mate) with organisms possessing that earlier trait. So while NS does not originate either trait, it is responsible for the preponderance of organisms possessing both. Add more and more adaptive traits, extending the process over millions of years, and it is obvious that NS has had a significant influence over the cumulative genetic structure of modern organisms.\n \n \n \nMore theoretical speculation.

And it doesn't have to be 'the right one'. It just has to confer an advantage; be relatively better. Look at dolphins: their adaption to oceanic dwelling is successful without being 'right': they can't breathe or drink the medium in which they spend their entire lives. Adaptive mutations don't have to hit the bullseye; some just have to get that little bit closer than others and over time NS will shape the gene pool, so that the next adaptive mutation will tend to stack.\n \n You also mention the 'rapid rate' of evolution disproving RM+NS. This is a fallacy based both on an over-simplification of Darwinian evolution, and (unfortunately yet another) misapplication of a statement made regarding evolution as it is presently defined. Evolution of a population can indeed proceed rapidly: existing traits within a population (finch beak sizes for instance) can very quickly rise to dominance if differential reproductive success is sufficiently marked.\n \n \nYou can say what you please, but don't be offended if some of us can see that your beliefs are irrational. \n\n \n Advice you could do with taking yourself sometimes :)",

   "LOL. I love the pomp and bluster. \n \n The really fun ones only come along every so often, welcome aboard ww.\n \n \n**\n If by 'theory of evolution' you do not equivocate and actually intend the fact of evolution, but rather, do honestly refer to the chance-based darwinian RMNS notion, then I disagree. I believe that anyone who truly believes in and is committed to promoting the \"RMNS\" darwinian explanation must be, like Richard Dawkins, \"an intellectually fulfilled atheist\".\n\n \n What of the world's millions of Roman Catholics?\n \n The actual process does not have to be guided step by step, only the mechanism by which the process proceeds need be put in place (ie RM+NS) in order to satisfy the theistic evolutionist. \n \n \nCertainly most people accept 'evolution' per se. The OP stats for the USA, I suspect, apply not to 'evolution' in se, but rather to the darwinian RMNS explanation for it. Whether that is the case or not, there is absolutely no law in science that a person doing a certain job has to pay more than lip service to any metaphysical postulate seemingly required for the job. If RC priests can spend their adult lives saying mass, hearing confessions, and buggering little boys, then its no big deal for biologists, let alone any other scientist, to just pay the required obsequities to RMNS, stuff it on a mental back-shelf, and just get on with what they do everyday.\n\n \n And this is relevent how?\n \n \nThose people who are truly committed psychologically to RMNS darwinism are those like P.Z. Myers, Richard Hoppe, Nick Manke(??), Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennet, et al, who constantly evangelise the notion everywhere they can, including message boards like this one, IIDB, Panda's Thumb, and others. And they are all committed atheists. Evangelical atheists. \n\n \n Every issue has it's end points. They don't affect the reality of what goes on in the middle.\n \n \nWhether or not you can accept this fact is of no moment to me. It's still a fact.\n\n \n What fact is that? That SOME of those who believe in the T of E, complete with RM+NS, are staunch atheists? Still doesn't come anywhere near proving your generalizations.\n \n Take a moment on that one.\n \n \n**\n No, it is not. No-one who fits the description I've just given is exempt. And it does not have to be a \"conspiracy\", since the evangelical atheist movement is actually quite open and unapologetic about their agendum. No conspiracy there.\n\n \n See above.\n \n I don't see any of those listed above having any influence over the millions of other scientists out there that must be complicit in order for your generalizations to hold water.\n \n \"Evangelical atheist\", nice term by the way, it's no \"truthiness\" but it might catch on.\n \n \n**\n It's a hell of a lot more substantive than the rhetorical questions and raised eyebrows that are all you've been able to muster.\n \n **\n Well, I suspect that's probably your best, anyway. Come back if you've ever got something real to contribute, waxy.\n\n \n LOL. If 5 dollar words and misplaced arrogance equals substantive, then you're right, it was a hell of a lot more substantive than my post.\n \n Waxy",

   "The posters who feel the Theory of Evolution has no validity or is \"unscientific\" have various claims why such an overwhelming majority of scientists (and essentially all biologists) disagree with them.\n \n There are claims of bias, conspiracy, political correctness, etc., though I have yet to understand what would be the incentive to behave that way. In that hundreds or thousands of studies are submitted for acceptance by peer reviewed journals, the lowly junior scientist really can't make a name for herself by adding yet another confirmatory piece of information.\n \n Can you imagine if there was even a single, well-designed and executed piece of research that seemed to refute evolution? That researcher would be a rock star. Oh, certainly the ivory towers might initially pooh-pooh such an upstart. But time and time again, this sort of thing happens in all branches of science - and that is how ideas change about how the world works. Indeed, there is arguably a great incentive to buck the system. \n \n Why then is there not a single piece of research in a peer reviewed journal that supports ID or creationism? The Discovery Institute has oodles of money to start their own journal, but there is simply nothing to put in it. Nor are there enough \"peers\" to serve on a board.\n \n Anyway, my questions are these:\n \n WW and SS and marc, etc. feel that scientific thought about evolution is highly flawed.\n \n 1. Are there any other branches of science (other than evolutionary biology) that you feel are flawed?\n 2. If not, why do you think that scientists would selectively err in only a single branch of science. What would be their incentive?\n\n \n #1 - Yes. Other branches of science have been bent to accommodate Darwinian evoluton. That's the only reason they would be flawed. If the evolutionist bible, the 'Origin of Species' isn't involved, then I trust science. As ww said;\n \n \nAny threat to 'darwinism' is, therefore, as much a threat to any atheistic and materialist true-believer's sense of identity as any threat to 'the bible'/torah/koran is a threat to any fundamentalist abrahamic true-believer's sense of identity. \n\n \n The 'Origin of Species' is the evolutionist's sense of identity. Shortly after its writing in 1859 to the present day, it spawned a whole new world of ethics and philosophy, and is firmly entrenched in popular culture. Do you not find it strange that nothing in the latest mainstream scientific studies questions or disputes anything in this 150 year old book?\n \n \nCan you imagine if there was even a single, well-designed and executed piece of research that seemed to refute evolution? That researcher would be a rock star. \n\n \n Note what's been done to Michael Behe, and you see how stifling dissent has become an art form among evolutionists. Research for evolution is heavily involved with university grant money. As SS said, it's all about the money.\n \n If Darwinian evolution was as secure as it's proponents claim, they simply would not be afraid of comparisons to ID in school classrooms. The deeper discussions about it go, the shakier it gets. As to the tired, misleading references to Catholic beliefs we're seeing here, you'll note that no \"theistic evolutionist\" (Christian) has finished any discussion with me in this forum.

   "#1 - Yes. Other branches of science have been bent to accommodate Darwinian evoluton. That's the only reason they would be flawed. If the evolutionist bible, the 'Origin of Species' isn't involved, then I trust science.\nBut none of the other fields of science that I mentioned (astrophysics, cosmology, astronomy, geology, paleontology, and nuclear physics) have anything to do with Darwinian evolution. They are not influenced by On the Origin of Species. So why is it that creationists generally reject all science in favor of mythology?\n \nThe 'Origin of Species' is the evolutionist's sense of identity.\nNope. It's not. It is actually relevant only as history. There has been so much research done in the last 150 years that what Darwin said about anything doesn't actually carry that much weight anymore. His important concepts have been confirmed too many times that he isn't even quoted in research papers. The research done since then is much more important because we know so much more now.\n \nShortly after its writing in 1859 to the present day, it spawned a whole new world of ethics and philosophy, and is firmly entrenched in popular culture.\nActually, ethics and philosophy are irrelevant. If they are based on Darwin, then they are wrong. Possibly are you referring to the eugenics policies and genocide policies of christian Nazis?\n \nDo you not find it strange that nothing in the latest mainstream scientific studies questions or disputes anything in this 150 year old book?\nNot strange at all. It's been done to death. Darwin was wrong about some things, and they have been cast aside. The rest is no longer questioned because it has been confirmed to the extent that it is no longer in question.\n \nNote what's been done to Michael Behe, and you see how stifling dissent has become an art form among evolutionists. Research for evolution is heavily involved with university grant money. As SS said, it's all about the money.\nBut Behe didn't do any research. He wrote a popular book that was based on his ideas about mouse traps. He didn't get any research money because his book was a comercial venture that added no new scientific knowledge. Perhaps you are unaware that Behe is a theistic evolutionist, a Roman Catholic in fact. He made lots of money off of the fundamentalist christian dupes with his book.\n \nIf Darwinian evolution was as secure as it's proponents claim, they simply would not be afraid of comparisons to ID in school classrooms.\nBut science classes are for teaching science and ID has not shown that it is science. There is no evidence and no research has been done yet. It has been around for more than a dozen years and we are still waiting for any actual research to be done.\n \nThe deeper discussions about it go, the shakier it gets.\nI'm glad you recognize the position of ID. It just doesn't stand up to any sort of rational examination.\n \nAs to the tired, misleading references to Catholic beliefs we're seeing here, you'll note that no \"theistic evolutionist\" (Christian) has finished any discussion with me in this forum. And that no one has accepted my formal debate challange.\nCheck with Behe. Maybe he will be willing to debate you. You seem to be unaware that he is a theistic evolutionist. Please don't embarrass yourself by claiming that Behe is an old earth creationist. It is already evident that you haven't read Behe's book. That would be a good place to learn what he thinks. Another would be his testimony at the Dover trial. Maybe you can get Ken Miller to debate you since he too is a theistic evolutionist. And Miller has the advantage of being a biologist, whereas Behe is a biochemist.\n \n Good luck.",

It just requires biologists who are not blinded to empirical reality by their need to uphold a 19th century metaphysic. \n \n What you are trying to do here is to somehow discredit my ideas by claiming that they are as religiously based as your own atheistic foundation. The idea being that anyone who does not attend your atheist church, is somehow deluded about reality. Talk about the arrogance of the 'true-believer'!!

   "The question 'is evolution atheistic?' is a very different beast from 'is evolution based on atheistic principles?'. To a layman, the former asks whether communicating or teaching evolution, or the ToE, is a denial of the existence of god. \n \n Now, I'd personally say it isn't, because it's just one of many statements regarding what we can observe and deduce about the natural world. Some might disagree (and have done when discussing the matter with me), claiming that teaching evolution diminishes or belittles god by either removing him from the frame or restricting what he is capable of doing. My response to that is threefold: \n \n First, understanding what god did in no way limits what he could have done: we can measure the height of Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth, without in any way implying that god could not have made a taller one had he so chose. \n \n Second, evolution only belittles god if you personally find the idea less impressive than your personal creation story (specifically the parts concerning how living creatures came to be the way we see them now, excluding how life originated). But since it's perfectly easy to invent a creation story more impressive than that in (for example) the bible, the same argument could apply: biblical creation belittles god because it isn't the most impressive creation story possible. \n \n All of which begs the question: do you really think god made everything in order to impress us? Once you accept that he did not, the question of how impressive his methods seem to us is exposed as entirely irrelevant, since it is as likely as anything that our appreciation of what is 'impressive' is as flawed as a child's. \n \n Fourth, diminishing or belittling something is not the same as saying it doesn't exist. This is a particularly awkward distinction to accept for those who automatically equate believing in god with worshipping and glorifying him, but it is a valid (if pedantic) point nonetheless. One can be deist or theist without actually liking god.\n \n My contention is that the accusation of evolution being atheistic is in reality motivated by the fact that it disputes specific creation stories, not because it says anything on the subject of the existence or non-existence of god. Unless you're prepared to be extraordinarily generous concerning the metaphorical nature of the early bible, evolution (both the observable evidence and the theory developed from it) is rather a-genesis. The generalisation of it being atheistic is prompted less by philosophical accuracy than by a psychologically accurate assessment that more people will sit up and listen and pass laws if you shout about something being 'anti-god' than 'anti-a-particular-interpretation-of-a-story-in-the-old-testament'. The former sounds like a threat to civilisation, whereas the latter makes you sound like a bit of a pedant. \n \n The other question, 'is evolution based on atheistic principles?', is far more subtle. In a sense, any attempt to explain anything about the world around us in naturalistic terms - and certainly the acceptance of the results of such an investigation - could be said to be based on atheistic principles since it involves the following assumption: \"If it doesn't look like god did it, god didn't do it\", which implicitly elevates naturalistic evidence above faith. However, this (rather extreme) interpretation can be countered by pointing out that the alternative is to deny the use and value of our senses and the brain god gave us to consider what they tell us.\n \n How can we resolve this conflict? \n \n Well, we can start by observing that the assumption above is not the only necessary and sufficient prerequisite for exploring naturalistic explanations. We could just as easily pursue naturalistic explanations for phenomena via the scientific method with a philosophy outlined as follows:\n \n 1. God gave us (by whatever method) senses and a brain for a reason, and would not deliberately lie to us through them.\n 2. As imperfect beings, our understanding of exactly how god works or how he has acted in the past is unlikely to be right first time; we should work to achieve a better understanding since a clearer appreciation of his actual methods is bound to enlighten us.\n \n Evolution (observation and theory) sits equally well with such a philosophy as with one that denies the existence of god. It cannot therefore be said to be 'based upon' atheistic principles, since the implication there is that it would be incompatible with any theistic philosophy.\n \n On a personal note, I think the above is actually quite a nice philosophy. I certainly think that our naturalistic investigations have served to enlighten us, and anything humbling to our ego in the discoveries about our evolutionary past is, if we are honest, nothing more than that: humbling to our ego. And anyway, why should ape-like shared ancestry in any way diminish what we have become? Do we think a pearl less beautiful when we learn its origin, or do we marvel all the more? Do we respect a self-made rags-to-riches millionaire less than the boy handed the world on a plate by his rich and indulgent parents?\n \n The sciences show us that the universe is not a mere handful of thousand years old and already falling apart like last year's Vauxhall Corsa (as YECs would have us believe with their stories of the 'fall' and purely entropic mutation); it is billions of years old and just getting started. The sciences - particularly those concerned with evolution - show us that even though entropy may triumph in the end, order and reason win the only victories that matter.\n \n I'll leave you with this thought: in fields of endeavour such as microchip design, the products of our most ingenious, creative human minds are routinely outdone or improved by the application of simple processes (mutation and selection) we derived from nature. Compare that with point 2. of the philosophy outlined above, proposing that dilligent inspection of god's creation would be enlightening. Just how amazing is this universe, if the operation of its most mundane axioms can outstrip the human intellect; if simply by existing it can produce complexity of which we can scarcely conceive and must struggle to apprehend at all? If just by existing it can produce us?",

We have already invalidated your claim so there is no need for a fruitless debate. \n\n \n I don't think he's ever heard the axiom: \"If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, chances are very good that it is actually a duck\".\n \n If it looks like an atheist when it posts, walks around basic Christian concepts as it harmonizes with atheists, quacks about evolution like atheists, chances are very good that it is actually an atheist. Actual Christian evolutionists never seem to make any effort to separate themselves from atheists who don the Christian uniform. It's because they don't actually know enough about the very basics of Christianity to be able to recognize them.\n \n 9)GazzaElliot. Said no in post #44 of this thread. \n \n Now we'll watch you sputter with rage as you try to justify your lie. \n \n (darn, I gotta quit feeding trolls, too much fun sometimes emoticon_xangel )",

   "The question 'is evolution atheistic?' is a very different beast from 'is evolution based on atheistic principles?'. To a layman, the former asks whether communicating or teaching evolution, or the ToE, is a denial of the existence of god. \n\n \n Why don't you pick either one - I'll give you the choice on which one you do the negative on. :) \n \n \nNow, I'd personally say it isn't, because it's just one of many statements regarding what we can observe and deduce about the natural world. Some might disagree (and have done when discussing the matter with me), claiming that teaching evolution diminishes or belittles god by either removing him from the frame or restricting what he is capable of doing. My response to that is threefold: \n \n First, understanding what god did in no way limits what he could have done: we can measure the height of Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth, without in any way implying that god could not have made a taller one had he so chose. \n\n \n There's a difference between measuring something here today, and asserting ancient history, with no observers there to see it. \n \n \nSecond, evolution only belittles god if you personally find the idea less impressive than your personal creation story (specifically the parts concerning how living creatures came to be the way we see them now, excluding how life originated). But since it's perfectly easy to invent a creation story more impressive than that in (for example) the bible, the same argument could apply: biblical creation belittles god because it isn't the most impressive creation story possible. \n\n \n The only creation story that is relevant is the one that is by far the most politically influential in today's western culture. There are several religions that are actually compatable with Darwinian evolution, but they have practically nothing to do with western culture. \n \n \nAll of which begs the question: do you really think god made everything in order to impress us? Once you accept that he did not, the question of how impressive his methods seem to us is exposed as entirely irrelevant, since it is as likely as anything that our appreciation of what is 'impressive' is as flawed as a child's. \n \n Fourth, diminishing or belittling something is not the same as saying it doesn't exist. This is a particularly awkward distinction to accept for those who automatically equate believing in god with worshipping and glorifying him, but it is a valid (if pedantic) point nonetheless. One can be deist or theist without actually liking god. \n\n \n To \"not like God\", is a very good first step to later denying his existance, wouldn't you say?\n \n \nMy contention is that the accusation of evolution being atheistic is in reality motivated by the fact that it disputes specific creation stories, not because it says anything on the subject of the existence or non-existence of god. \n\n \n People who represent it are doing the disputing, and they aren't silent on the existance or non existance of God. \n \n \n \nUnless you're prepared to be extraordinarily generous concerning the metaphorical nature of the early bible, evolution (both the observable evidence and the theory developed from it) is rather a-genesis. The generalisation of it being atheistic is prompted less by philosophical accuracy than by a psychologically accurate assessment that more people will sit up and listen and pass laws if you shout about something being 'anti-god' than 'anti-a-particular-interpretation-of-a-story-in-the-old-testament'. The former sounds like a threat to civilisation, whereas the latter makes you sound like a bit of a pedant. \n \n The other question, 'is evolution based on atheistic principles?', is far more subtle. In a sense, any attempt to explain anything about the world around us in naturalistic terms - and certainly the acceptance of the results of such an investigation - could be said to be based on atheistic principles since it involves the following assumption: \"If it doesn't look like god did it, god didn't do it\", which implicitly elevates naturalistic evidence above faith. However, this (rather extreme) interpretation can be countered by pointing out that the alternative is to deny the use and value of our senses and the brain god gave us to consider what they tell us.\n \n How can we resolve this conflict? \n \n Well, we can start by observing that the assumption above is not the only necessary and sufficient prerequisite for exploring naturalistic explanations. We could just as easily pursue naturalistic explanations for phenomena via the scientific method with a philosophy outlined as follows:\n \n 1. God gave us (by whatever method) senses and a brain for a reason, and would not deliberately lie to us through them.\n 2. As imperfect beings, our understanding of exactly how god works or how he has acted in the past is unlikely to be right first time; we should work to achieve a better understanding since a clearer appreciation of his actual methods is bound to enlighten us.\n \n Evolution (observation and theory) sits equally well with such a philosophy as with one that denies the existence of god. It cannot therefore be said to be 'based upon' atheistic principles, since the implication there is that it would be incompatible with any theistic philosophy.\n \n On a personal note, I think the above is actually quite a nice philosophy. I certainly think that our naturalistic investigations have served to enlighten us, and anything humbling to our ego in the discoveries about our evolutionary past is, if we are honest, nothing more than that: humbling to our ego. And anyway, why should ape-like shared ancestry in any way diminish what we have become? Do we think a pearl less beautiful when we learn its origin, or do we marvel all the more? Do we respect a self-made rags-to-riches millionaire less than the boy handed the world on a plate by his rich and indulgent parents?\n \n The sciences show us that the universe is not a mere handful of thousand years old and already falling apart like last year's Vauxhall Corsa (as YECs would have us believe with their stories of the 'fall' and purely entropic mutation); it is billions of years old and just getting started. The sciences - particularly those concerned with evolution - show us that even though entropy may triumph in the end, order and reason win the only victories that matter.\n \n I'll leave you with this thought: in fields of endeavour such as microchip design, the products of our most ingenious, creative human minds are routinely outdone or improved by the application of simple processes (mutation and selection) we derived from nature. Compare that with point 2. of the philosophy outlined above, proposing that dilligent inspection of god's creation would be enlightening. Just how amazing is this universe, if the operation of its most mundane axioms can outstrip the human intellect; if simply by existing it can produce complexity of which we can scarcely conceive and must struggle to apprehend at all? If just by existing it can produce us?\n\n \n I'd appreciate it if you would pick one of the two resolutions for me to take the affirmative on. I believe we'd both be \"winners\". :)",

   "There's a difference between measuring something here today, and asserting ancient history, with no observers there to see it.\n\n \n True, but then again our observations of evolution are not confined to ancient history. We observe evolution and speciation in action today; fossil, genetic and biogeographical evidence on the other hand indicates this is a process that has been going on for billions of years. So which is the supposedly atheistic part? The process, readily verifiable, or the mountains of evidence signposting its past activities?\n \n The salient point here is that all evidence is to one degree or another historical, and we judge its value at least in part according to how well it is corroborated by other independent sources of evidence. The historical evidence for biblical creation (as far as the current forms life takes is concerned) is a book - one not written, it should be noted, by those supposedly 'there' in the garden of eden. Not even Adam is described as witnessing the creation of anything other than Eve. The evidence for an evolutionary origin of those same forms is in the very rocks beneath our feet, the genes within every cell of every organism and in their pattern of distribution upon the planet's surface.\n \n \nThe only creation story that is relevant is the one that is by far the most politically influential in today's western culture. There are several religions that are actually compatable with Darwinian evolution, but they have practically nothing to do with western culture. \n\n \n So would I be right in saying that your claim is not so much that evolution is inherently atheistic, but that it is anti-christian, and that in western culture that effectively equates to atheism? That's similar to the point I was making earlier: evolution on its own doesn't say anything about the existence or non-existence of god, it only contradicts certain creation stories. \n \n But there is no creation story in the New Testament, which itself demonstrated that the teachings of the OT were very much open to revision. There is nothing remotely anti-christian about re-evaluating history prior to Jesus, so whether or not 'anti-christian' genuinely equates to atheism (an argument I feel you would struggle mightily to make stick without burning an awful lot of dictionaries and internets) is irrelevant.\n \n \nTo \"not like God\", is a very good first step to later denying his existance, wouldn't you say?\n\n \n Well, since not liking something implicitly accepts there is something to dislike, no :) Not liking the concept of a god is a different matter, but I was careful in my wording.\n \n \nPeople who represent it are doing the disputing, and they aren't silent on the existance or non existance of God. \n\n \n I think if we're honest we have a tendency to decide for ourselves who 'represents' an idea we don't personally like, usually chosen to cast that idea, by association, in as unfavourable a light as possible. Based on who you've chosen, we could equally well declare pullovers with leather elbow patches atheistic too - when they are of course the devil's work.\n \n Obviously, the fact of evolution is congruent with atheist philosophy. The comment that it allows someone to be an 'intellectually fulfilled' atheist is an accurate one: it allows us to reduce the problem of 'how did all this multifaceted life get here?' to the problem of 'how did a few organic molecules get here?', which, though it is far from a complete naturalistic explanation for the origin of life, does represent progress towards such an explanation, and intellectual fulfillment really only requires that continuous progress be made.\n \n So although as we've agreed it is not incompatible with religion or theism, evolution does allow atheists to present a stronger case than they would otherwise, and they wield it enthusiastically. However, one must also recognise that any atheistic mileage derived from evolution is fuelled entirely by the fervour with which the religious disown it. To put it another way, atheists are over the moon that religious groups keep banging on about evolution being a lie, because the facts overwhelmingly favour evolution and denying it makes theists look, at best divided, at worst stupid and backward and curmudgeonly. Atheists can pick and choose who 'represents' religion every bit as easily as you.\n \n If you genuinely want to oppose atheism effectively, rather than just making a self-consciously noble but ultimately counterproductive last stand, you should be working to integrate evolution into the christian message, adopting it as your own and telling everyone how marvellous it is and how they should come and hear more about it at their local church. Partly because evolution isn't anti-christian: god sending his only son to redeem the souls of a lifeform that dragged itself up to contemplate the infinite is, if anything, a gift even more precious, and a story of even greater, earned love, but mostly because evolution simply isn't going anywhere - it can't; it's stamped like a hallmark on every scrap of living tissue and every fossil scattered throughout the planet's crust. Even if you succeed in striking it from the worldwide curriculum, in a hundred years, or a thousand, or ten thousand, or ten million, someone or something will dig up a bone or sequence some DNA and you'll be back to square one, and you'd better hope like heck nobody remembers you covering it up the first time.\n \n As far as turning this into a formal debate goes, I'd have to go and check out some others, see how the format works and whether it's appropriate. The definition of evolution given earlier is fair enough (if a little broad for our purposes) but I note no such mutually agreed definition was proposed for 'atheist' or 'atheism' or 'atheistic principles', that latter being an especially moveable feast in my opinion.",

(check some of his threads and posts in the 'debate tournaments' forum) We have recently gone by his guidelines of a 5/4 post structure. The affirmative poster (the one with the burden of proof) gets 5 posts - he begins and ends the debate, he and the negative poster alternate for a total of nine posts. The two participants need to agree on time limits between posts, word limits, and judge approval. On time limits, I think 72 hours is good - keeps the debate from going on more than a few weeks. (Less than that can be difficult for those of us who work for a living.) I'm flexibe on word limits - my preference is for none, but an understanding that a judge will frown on long winded, difficult to read posts. \n \n We used to use three judges, but it has been recently decided by a moderator to use only one. Daewoo had been named as a judge for most debates, but since I've competed with him before, I'm sure that makes it understandable to anyone why he shouldn't be a judge for me. The moderator will have to find one - I think it makes sense to select someone who's posted at these forums for awhile, shows some maturity, and yet shows little interest in the religion / evolution forums. Billsco has been the moderator since dsadevil left, but has recently had some time constraints, so JPSartre12 is the latest moderator. If you accept, the next move will be his to find a suitable judge, subject to both of our approvals. I'm not going to be too picky, but as I said, his or her posting history shouldn't indicate much interest in this subject. Other than coming to an agreement concerning time between posts and word limits, that's about all there is to it. \n \n There have never been any stipulations for 'definitions' in any of the past debates. I'm not completely opposed to it, but it could easily cause a lot of problems, which I outlined in this thread, post # 46;\n \n \nHow is this going to work with multiple resolutions? Am I not permitted to comment on the definitions? If I stray from these \"definitons\", what happens? Do I forfeit immediately, or are the offending words just deleted right away? Do you alert the judge of my offense, if you and the judge disagree with the extent of my violation, who decides? Since this has never been done before, more questions are likely to come up after the debate has started. How will those questions and decisions interfere with the time limits? \n\n \n Since I don't think definitions are necessary, I think they are a part of the debate, and they have never been necessary before, it's not my problem to make suggestions about the above issues. I think it's up to the opponent who insists upon them to work with the moderator and decide how my above questions are answered. When I mentioned that to debate rejectors 1, 2, and 4 in my above list, they vacated of course. \n \n But if you insist on definitions, it's probably not going to work out. Evolution can mean everything from changes in organisms in a lawbound way from similar forms, to the whole ideological picture that has been built on evolution. Evolutionists switch them at will - the \"Catholics are atheists\" strawman that is constantly thrown at me is only one example. It's no wonder they're afraid I might expose it. \n \n Post up when you decide. emoticon_xangel",

   "Not work out for me - for me to approve it. \n \n \n \n Likewise, I'm hesitant to accept a debate where I might spend 72 hours showing how evolution is atheistic, only to have that dismissed on the grounds that some preset, non-debatable definition states that evolution simply means \"change in allele frequencies over time\", and has NOTHING to do with speciation, falsifying the book of Genesis, blind watchmakers, billions of years, rinse and repeat, and dismiss countless times, by a gang of.....nine or so other posters. Can you guess who they would be?\n \n So the solution to the problem seems to be for neither of us to be restricted by auxiliary definitions (as no past formal debate ever has here before) and use words carefully and concisely as possible to convince the reader (or judge, depending on how important that is to you) that you made the best case for your belief, as every past formal debate has here before. Disagreements over word definitions has happened in past formal debates. It all worked out. (against me once, as I recall emoticon_cry )\n \n \n \n \n \n Even if that were true, the whole ideological picture has been shortened to the word evolution, and that is how it is used and thought of in society. But it's not completely true - note number 4 in dictionary.com's definition of evolution. \n \n \n \n Nine others are afraid of number 4.

Many evolutionists, when pressed, will retreat from that and say that evolution only means change in allele frequencies over time, and has no more to do with the book of Genesis than....plumbing. \n \n \n \n I believe it does in western culture, the political wars going on in western culture, because that two way battle influences the politics of the entire world more than any other. It's part of the debate. \n \n \n \n You can define atheism any way you want, and we'll discuss it. I'm not going to ask for word limits. (counts)\n\n \n Dude, definition number four has absolutely NOTHING to do with your claim that evolution is atheistic, and that those think it is true are atheists. If you actually read it, it is talking about the changes of social and economic systems in a way that is close to what evolution is in the natural world. You're grasping at straws here.",

   "Not work out for me - for me to approve it.\n\n \n Yeah, that's pretty much what I thought :)\n \n \nLikewise, I'm hesitant to accept a debate where I might spend 72 hours showing how evolution is atheistic, only to have that dismissed on the grounds that some preset, non-debatable definition states that evolution simply means \"change in allele frequencies over time\", and has NOTHING to do with speciation, falsifying the book of Genesis, blind watchmakers, billions of years\n\n \n Well, either word definitions have significance or they don't. If you want a debate based on all the dictionary definitions listed earlier, that's fine; what I don't see much point in is a debate involving the ad hoc invention of new meanings or appeals to 'everyone knows...' populist misconceptions.\n \n \nEven if that were true, the whole ideological picture has been shortened to the word evolution, and that is how it is used and thought of in society.\n\n \n That's a pretty disingenuous statement, marc. Those who have 'shortened', or as I prefer it conflated the 'ideological picture of atheism' with 'evolution' are principally strict christians such as yourself who have an ulterior motive for spreading that belief. This argument boils down to 'For years now some religious groups have been saying evolution is the same as atheism, and we've said it so long and so loud that enough people believe us to make it true.' I'm not about to debate with you whether vociferous religious equivocation and misrepresentation has succeeded in convincing a largely ignorant public, because we both know that's absolutely true. ;) Whether or not evolution is atheistic has nothing to do with whether a lot of people wrongly believe it to be.\n \n \nBut it's not completely true - note number 4 in dictionary.com's definition of evolution. \n \n 4. a process of gradual, peaceful, progressive change or development, as in social or economic structure or institutions. \n \n Nine others are afraid of number 4. Without it, the discussion isn't complete.\n\n \n You can't be serious.

To be rigorously specific, then, I would say that the observed facts supporting evolution falsify some interpretations of the genesis creation story.\n \n \nI believe it does in western culture, the political wars going on in western culture, because that two way battle influences the politics of the entire world more than any other.\n\n \n Now that's debatable!\n \n \nYou can define atheism any way you want, and we'll discuss it.

   "likewise, I'm hesitant to accept a debate where I might spend 72 hours showing how evolution is atheistic, only to have that dismissed on the grounds that some preset, non-debatable definition states that evolution simply means \"change in allele frequencies over time\", and has NOTHING to do with speciation, falsifying the book of Genesis, blind watchmakers, billions of years, rinse and repeat, and dismiss countless times, by a gang of.....nine or so other posters. Can you guess who they would be?\n\n \n People who have educations, brains and aren't the students of SATAN THE PRINCE OF LIES. You are the most dishonest SOB here. The fact that you refuse to accept the textbook definition of evolution shows just how honest you are. Someone who was looking for a honest discussion about evolution wouldn't deny or refuse to accept the biological definition found in textbooks. You won't accept it because it removes your ability to act like a dishonest SOB that makes Nixon look like a boyscout. The book of genesis is a false dependent of Evolution. I made a thread that debuked Genesis through the flood and no one who believed in creationism even tried to argue aganist. \n \n \nSo the solution to the problem seems to be for neither of us to be restricted by auxiliary definitions (as no past formal debate ever has here before) and use words carefully and concisely as possible to convince the reader (or judge, depending on how important that is to you) that you made the best case for your belief, as every past formal debate has here before.

Why should we give dracula the keys to the blood bank? Letting someone as genuinely dishonest as you get to play without definitions is like letting Hitler control the Jewish Ghettos. You don't do it because you know just how abusive that person will be. You claimed that evolution, biological evolution was atheistic. You now refuse to accept the biological definition. That is dishonest. This is obvious to everyone that is isn't about evolution, as you are claiming evolution falsifys Genesis. Anyone with a education (NOT YOU) knows that evolution starts once life already exists. Not before. How can Evolution falsify the creation of matter? It can't. \n \n \nnote number 4 in dictionary.com's definition of evolution.\n\n \n But not biological evolution which you have claimed is atheistic. We could argue that business evolution is atheistic but that's not the issue. \n \n \nNine others are afraid of number 4.

Waste of time. \n \n \nIf you believe, as I do, that evolution as it is understood and referred to today includes an alleged falsification of the Genesis creation story, then I don't really see what your problem is with definitions.\n\n \n And if you had a education you'd know that isn't true. And you'd know that evolution could not possibly faslify Genesis as it wouldn't have anything to act upon until life arouse. You seem to be genetically incapable to understanding what evolution is. How can evolution create matter? Does it even DEAL with the origin of matter? No. you keep saying other wise because you do not understand and have no education. \n \n \nMany evolutionists, when pressed, will retreat from that and say that evolution only means change in allele frequencies over time, and has no more to do with the book of Genesis than....plumbing. \n\n \n it has nothing to do with Genesis until life arouse.
