All people see is that Michael is weird, strange, eccentric even...but there is a song that he sang called \"Childhood\" he says in that song \n \"Have you seen my childhood\n I'm searching for the world\n That I come from\n 'Cause I've been looking around\n In the lost and found of my heart\n No one understands me\n They view it\n As such strange eccentricities ...\n 'Cause I keep kidding around\n Like a child\n but pardon me ...\n \n People say I'm not okay\n 'Cause I love such elementary things ...\n It's been my fate\n To compensate\n For the childhood I've never known ...\"\n so you see he never had a childhood...so he tries to make up for it..i would not say he is really that strange..I mean I know that I would rather be thought of as an individual and maybe even strange even, than being another packaged American Eagle clone...i mean wouldn't you? \n emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Ya know, I was just waiting for someone to bring up the case way back when in 1993, where Michael was accused of molesting a 12 year old boy, Jordy Chandler. I am going to post this article that tells u WAY more than I could say...and probably a lot nicer too ;) I'm only going to include major facts because this article is over 4 pages long.\n \"Was Michael Jackson Framed?\"\n Jackson's troubles began when his van broke down on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles in May 1992. Stranded in the middle of the heavily trafficked street, Jackson was spotted by the wife of Mel Green, an employee at Rent-a-Wreck, an offbeat car-rental agency a mile away. Green went to the rescue. When Dave Schwartz, the owner of the car-rental company, heard Green was bringing Jackson to the lot, he called his wife, June, and told her to come over with their 6-year-old daughter and her son from her previous marriage. The boy, then 12, was a big Jackson fan. Upon arriving, June Chandler Schwartz told Jackson about the time her son had sent him a drawing after the singer's hair caught on fire during the filming of a Pepsi commercial. Then she gave Jackson their home number. \n \n \"It was almost like she was forcing [the boy] on him,\" Green recalls. \"I think Michael thought he owed the boy something, and that's when it all started.\"And while it may be unusual for a 35-year-old man to have sleepovers with a 13-year-old child, the boy's mother and others close to Jackson never thought it odd. Jackson's behavior is better understood once it's put in the context of his own childhood. \"Contrary to what you might think, Michael's life hasn't been a walk in the park,\" one of his attorneys says. Jackson's childhood essentially stopped -- and his unorthodox life began -- when he was 5 years old and living in Gary, Indiana.\n Months later, Chandler returned to L.A. with his wife and held a series of dentistry jobs. By 1980, when their son was born, the couple's marriage was in trouble. \"One of the reasons June left Evan was because of his temper,\" a family friend says. They divorced in 1985. The court awarded sole custody of the boy to his mother and ordered Chandler to pay $500 a month in child support, but a review of documents reveals that in 1993, when the Jackson scandal broke, Chandler owed his ex-wife $68,000 -- a debt she ultAt first, Chandler welcomed and encouraged his son's relationship with Michael Jackson, bragging about it to friends and associates. When Jackson and the boy stayed with Chandler during May 1993, Chandler urged the entertainer to spend more time with his son at his house. According to sources, Chandler even suggested that Jackson build an addition onto the house so the singer could stay there. After calling the zoning department and discovering it couldn't be done, Chandler made another suggestion -- that Jackson just build him a new home. (my personal opinion right here, WHAT THE HELL IS UP WITH EVAN?! ASKING SUCH A SWEET AND INNOCENT MAN TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON THEM! What a greedy butthead!!) At no time has Chandler claimed to have witnessed any sexual misconduct on Jackson's part. \n \n Chandler became increasingly volatile, making threats that alienated Jackson, Dave Schwartz and June Chandler Schwartz. In early July 1993, Dave Schwartz, who had been friendly with Chandler, secretly tape-recorded a lengthy telephone conversation he had with him. During the conversation, Chandler talked of his concern for his son and his anger at Jackson and at his ex-wife, whom he described as \"cold and heartless.\" When Chandler tried to \"get her attention\" to discuss his suspicions about Jackson, he says on the tape, she told him \"Go **** yourself.\" \"We were friends. I liked him and I respected him and everything else for what he is. There was no reason why he had to stop calling me. I sat in the room one day and talked to Michael and told him exactly what I want out of this whole relationship. What I want.\" \n \n Admitting to Schwartz that he had \"been rehearsed\" about what to say and what not to say, Chandler never mentioned money during their conversation. When Schwartz asked what Jackson had done that made Chandler so upset, Chandler alleged only that \"he broke up the family. [The boy] has been seduced by this guy's power and money.\" Both men repeatedly berated themselves as poor fathers to the boy. Elsewhere on the tape, Chandler indicated he was prepared to move against Jackson: \"It's already set,\" Chandler told Schwartz. \"There are other people involved that are waiting for my phone call that are in certain positions. I've paid them to do it. Everything's going according to a certain plan that isn't just mine. Once I make that phone call, this guy [his attorney, Barry K. Rothman, presumably] is going to destroy everybody in sight in any devious, nasty, cruel way that he can \n do it. And I've given him full authority to do that.\" \n \n Chandler then predicted what would, in fact, transpire six weeks later: \"And if I go through with this, I win big-time. There's no way I lose. I've checked that inside out. I will get everything I want, and they will be destroyed forever. June will lose [custody of the son]...and Michael's career will be over.\" \n (another personal comment, EVAN IS SOOOO EVIL!!!)\"Does that help [the boy]?\" Schwartz asked. \n \n \"That's irrelevant to me,\" Chandler replied. \"It's going to be bigger than all of us put together. The whole thing is going to crash down on everybody and destroy everybody in sight. It will be a massacre if I don't get what I want.\" \n THAT IS ONLY PART OF THE ARTICLE!! Just a little glimpse...If you would like to read the full article go to... http://members.aol.com/mjnfc/pagetwo.html\n Also I would like to add that when Jordy Chandler was told what to say, he was under the influence of heavy drugs that his father injected in him so that he could gain as much from this...disregarding his son...just using his son as a way to ruin Michael.\n ALSO\n His music is NOT some stupid pop music, like Britney Spears. He puts thought into his lyrics and its just SO wonderful!! He writes his own songs, starts new trends, donates more money to charity then anyone else!!, and of course loves what he does and is a genius of the past, present, and future.",

Anyways he is not a freak and how can u get by judging him like that? He does not look like a girl, and he is not a freak, people percieve him like that just because he is different! I would MUCH rather be thought of as different then (as i said) another American Eagle clone. You need more info to back up the HURTFUL, HORRIBLE, JUST UNCALLED FOR things that u have said. As u see I have put up MUCH of an arguement and what do u have to show for yourself? poor spelling and a bad attitude? Also to the balcony thing, Madison05...if you want to know what really happened then I will tell you. FIRST OF ALL, He was in Berlin, Germany accepting the HUMANITARIAN AWARD and he was in his 4th story hotel room. There are MILLIONS of fans below screaming, SHOW US UR NEW CHILD...so of course Michael was caught up in the moment and held onto his child OH SO TIGHTLY so that they could see him. I mean HES NOT CRAZY! ITS NOT LIKE HE WAS GOING TO THROW THE CHILD OFFA THE BALCONY! FOR GOD'S SAKE! HE SAID HE WOULD RATHER DIE THAN HURT A CHILD! I mean he loves children SO much, why can't people just accept him 4 who he is? Oh WAIT I know why, because there are people in the world WHO JUST JUDGE U BEFORE THEY EVEN KNOW U! That is why Mike does like children, because they dont judge him, adults judge him and accuse him of wrong doing. Its just horrible what people have done to him! Ya'll should be ashamed for your comments. Oh and to ur comments on OTHER singers, JOHN MAYER? PLEASE! HES JUST A BABY! HE HAS NOT BEEN THROUGH WHAT MJ HAS BEEN THROUGH! That is not quality music, i mean dont get me wrong i like a few songs but he is not obsession worthy. I do agree though, Sting is cool. Just not as cool as my main man, Michael Jackson. ;)",

I LOOOOVE The Red Hot Chili Peppers though :) They rock! Oh and OMG I ABSOLUTLY LOOOOVE Eric Clapton! Tears In Heaven is one of my all time favorite songs :( it makes me cry though, because it's SO incredibly sad...but this thread is about Michael and not his plastic surgery. As a musician, I have watched with dismay over the years as the drive for physical perfection took over the whole music industry. Now singers, even those who are barely out of their teens, are being advised to have plastic surgery if their faces or bodies are not quite what the record company executive had in mind. Struggling musicians who have spent years carving a path in the music industry are not likely to let a little surgery get in the way of imminent success. But we all know that this is not just a music business phenomenon. The rush for some pre-conceived (ill-conceived?) ideal of beauty has captured the entire entertainment industry. And as the entertainment industry goes, so goes the rest of North American culture. emoticon_idea Barbara Lewis from the Red Flags Weekly magazine says, \"The list goes on.\n \n And we are doing this to ourselves to find some unattainable, and changeable ideal beauty. \n \n Have you noticed that quite a few famous faces are beginning to look alike? The life-experience, the unique emotional landscape of their faces has been pulled into a tight wad of unwanted skin that is cut off behind the ears. They may have wrinkle free visages, but the one-of-kind facial personality is gone.\n \n Pop-singers are beginning to look like clones of one another. They sound alike. They look alike.\n \n Plastic surgery does have a big role to play in our society for those who are truly disfigured by birth or by accident. But we belittle these real problems of impairment when we take ourselves off to the block \"Botox Party,\" to sip a little wine and have the worry lines erased from our faces for a few weeks.\n \n The real worries are much deeper.",

He was ALWAYS told that he was ugly, and the music biz wanted him to look younger, like when he was in the J5, once he left motown he was free to have his own image and wanted to rid the image of being a little boy and more of a man.

The only crime here would be people judging him before they even get to know him. Okay obviously you didn't watch the Living With Michael Jackson documentary so I will fill you in on why he calls Prince 2, Blanket. You see Michael uses a term with his staff \"blanket\" or \"to blanket\" meaning it's a gift from above or its a gift, like saying \"I blanket you with...\" He uses that term with his friends, family, staff, etc. I don't think there is anything wrong with that, it has a lovely meaning. Who really cares if his nickname is Blanket, there are a lot worse things that he could be called, at least this meaning is sweet and pure.

He HAS had a nose job more than once, this has been proven, yet he denies this.\"\n -Of course it has been proven because HE ADMITTED TO HAVING MORE THAN ONE! What a shocker?! If you read the book Moonwalk you would know because he admits to plastic surgery in there having 2 nose jobs. (mind you this book came out in 1988 so it has changed but he has admitted to it) Also on his interview that is VERY recent \"Living with Michael Jackson\" he also admits to having plastic surgery.\n \n \"C.You might not think hes a molester sparkles im just sayin its a little suspicious when a dude sleeps with kids and builds a theme park so they will like him...must i go into any more details\"\n -First of all he does not ASK the kids to come in and sleep with him. They come in and ask him. He also asks the parents permission if it is alright for the child to sleep in his bed while he is sleeping on the floor in a sleeping bag. Once again that is where you are wrong. The theme park is not so kids will like him. It is because he is trying to recreate the childhood that he missed out on. His childhood was stolen from him and exchanged for eventual material land professional success. He would not change any part of his life, but now he can build the theme park for him to compensate for what he lost. He always wanted to go out and play but he couldn't. He had to stay and work. He though knows now that he has built his theme park and he can make more use of it by inviting children who don't have to pay anything to come in and have a good time. He has everything in a theme park that you can imagine. It's just another theme park, there are guards, there are people who start and stop the rides, there are vendors. It's just free for underprivilaged children. I don't see anything wrong with that.\n \n \"D.

I am beginning to wonder if maybe you were one of those children that he loved so well?????? And anyways, ok so the media makes more of an issue out of his face than his music.. ever wonder WHY?

Not tease like kids do at school but like ALWAYS teased him verbally abused and physically abused him. He was told he was ugly and had a huge nose. They called him pizza face and were very nasty to him.

   "I am sick of all this Michael Jackson XXXX. If I see another two hour block of Jackson on the tele im gonna shoot it. Let's set this straight. The \"freak\" is a pedofile. He has finally been caught doing what he has been getting away with for who knows how long. He is a very immature man (You can tell by the way he acts, talks, and reacts to the public). All this talk about how he was abused... how do you know for sure? Ok so maybe his brothers and sisters could be testament to the fact that he was called names and beaten and all that, but in the end my question for you is... WERE YOU THERE? If he is such a great person and whoever posted this (My internet is acting up so i can't check) makes a good point, if he is such a \"great\" black man who \"broke\" through many racial barriers, why does he get like 20 plastic surgeries(exaggeration) and then claim it is adolecence. Growing 4 inches is adolecence, but when you completely change from what you look like in 1985 to 2003 and your in your 40's by now, you know that either your a freak, or you need to really start telling yourself the truth. PLEASE FORGET ABOUT HIM. All this attention you people are giving him is exactly what this whole thing is. For all we know he could be broke and this is a way to get publicity. We have all heard the rumors and we don't know for sure, but by giving all this attention, playing like all of Jackson's songs for 3 straight hours on the radio, is only a publicity boost.

I'm not rocking back and forth chanting katie... though I know it can't be true. Gavin is just another kid trying to get some money. Plain and simple, just like 1993. Let's say we stir things up again... since u were awaiting my return... I guess I could respond to the stupid posts earlier... hmm I have to look back though. \n First I shall address montalban-\n what does MJ have to do with entertainment?\n hmmm... I dunno maybe the fact that his record is one of the largest selling albums of all times... or that he has survived more decades than any artist and remains a HUGE influence on millions...\n Next to address OldSouthPatriot-\n Only one way to respond to that and that is how I would handle this... these things usually go like this-\n \n I simply ask them things like, \"So have you stopped molesting children yet?\" Try answering yes OR no to that question. \n \n I usually get this puzzled look like, \"Who me?\" I might then go on to ask them, \"What made them stop molesting?\" If I am lucky they may trip up and say something like, \"I have never been a child molester?\" \n \n The point that I am making is that it is impossible to prove a negative, nor should we be asked to. The burden of proof justifiably should rest squarely in the lap of any accuser. I may go on to ask them to tell me where the proof, by conviction in our courts, is to be found in these charges against Michael. It is very unfortunate, but many people will tell you that Mike was convicted in 1993, but paid the courts $20 Million Dollars so that the case would be resolved. \n \n Mind you. They are not saying there was an out of court settlement of a civil case involving the Chandlers and their attorneys. When questioned more, they will tell you of their belief that Michael paid that money directly to the Courts to end the criminal charges. \n \n It may sound odd, but some people think Criminal Courts are much like Traffic Court, in that you can just be fined and the charges can be resolved. \n \n For those who will take the time, I simply place request. I ask them to look up the court actions taken against Michael and show me the record of any conviction. Often it takes a few days, but more than not, they return with a simple conclusion. Michael Jackson was never convicted of any molestation charges! \n \n It is daily ever more clear to me, that the Media has convicted Michael, and at this point many just accept a mussed together version of events, rather than anything that even comes close to the truth. \n \n As far as Michael and his care for children and generosity in charities and helping the sick and underprivileged, I have an easier time. Many know of his charitable works and contributions to the needy, though this often is explained away as a ploy on Mikes, part to divert attention from his deeper (Suspected wrongful) interest in children. I will say, this is an easier point to make. If Michael were to harbor bad intentions for children and their welfare, would it not be more likely that he would avoid any associations that would be suspect? \n \n My point is that there is no way that u can say Michael is guilty without evidence. Michael will not go to jail because I KNOW the truth will prevail. Once and for all Michael will finally be shown as the innocent, true, caring human being he really is.",

   "Go sundowner! excellent points! emoticon_xbouncer\n\n \n hmmm *raises eyebrow* I don't think I am the one guilty of \"stroking egos\" I think it's yall ;) You have like the whole forum on ur side besides me or goldylocks... Anyways here is the point of this post:\n \n Case against Jacko may be weakening\n BY CHRIS FUSCO Staff Reporter\n Suntimes - November 30, 2003\n \n \"Yes, he is a baby-dangling, crotch-grabbing, plastic-surgery-overhauled celebrity. Yes, he has said he enjoys sleeping next to children at a place called Neverland.\n But don't call the King of Pop a criminal. It's too early for that.\n With each passing day, the child-molestation case against Michael Jackson appears to grow weaker, though that could be because his lawyers have been trumpeting his innocence on the Internet and through the same mass media that have labeled their client a freak.\n Jackson's lead counsel, Mark Geragos, says his accuser's family is gold-digging. He's piggybacking off news reports that this is the third time the boy's mother has raised allegations of physical or sexual abuse in court.\n Also, a lawyer for the boy's father in his parents' divorce case said last week that the woman had a \"Svengali-like\" ability to make her children repeat her lies.\n The boy's family has filed no civil suit against Jackson, but \"if anybody doesn't think based upon what's happened so far that the true motivation of these charges and these allegations is anything but money . . . then they're living in their own Neverland,\" Geragos said. \"Michael Jackson is not going to be slammed.\"\n \"His lawyer is coming on very, very strong. As a result, it leads me to think he's got something,\" said Leonard L. Cavise, a DePaul College of Law professor who specializes in criminal procedure and evidence. \"He's not just sitting back. He's saying this guy's a victim.\"\n \"What we don't know is what, if anything, that the prosecution and the sheriff's office recovered from Michael Jackson's home,\" said Richard Kling, a Chicago-Kent College of Law professor and practicing criminal-defense attorney. \"If there's no additional evidence, the prosecutor is in a lot of trouble.\"\n \n A bizarre case so far\n Jackson, 45, celebrated Thanksgiving at an undisclosed location after posting $3 million bail Nov. 20 for his arrest for engaging in lewd or lascivious conduct with a child younger than 14. Since then, the Santa Barbara County district attorney's office has declined to comment, saying it will do so only after it files formal charges against the Gary, Ind., native. Those charges are expected before Christmas.\n The prosecution's silence has let a swirl of reports about Jackson's accuser's family surface in newspapers and on television. The boy reportedly has cancer, which sparked Jackson to befriend him.\n In November 2001, J.C. Penney Co. paid the boy's family $137,500 to settle a lawsuit that accused company security guards of beating the boy, his mother and his brother in a parking lot after a boy left a J.C. Penney store with clothes that hadn't been paid for, the Associated Press reported. The mother also accused a security guard of sexually assaulting her during the incident, which happened in 1998.\n A month before the settlement, the boy's mother filed for divorce and accused his father of child abuse. Russell Halpern, the father's attorney, told the AP that the mother lied and that the father once showed him a script she allegedly had written for her children to use in a deposition.\n That information -- combined with the background that Jackson paid a reported multimillion-dollar settlement in a 1993 case involving similar sex-abuse allegations -- could help the star in court.\n \"This cuts to the credibility of the accuser and the accuser's family,\" said DePaul's Cavise. \"In most sexual abuse cases -- absent physical evidence, DNA or injury to sexual organs -- it's usually the case where it's the word of the victim and whatever the victim has told his or her parents or his crisis counselors.\"\n A judge would need to decide that the information about the boy's mother is relevant for it to be presented in court, which could prove challenging -- but not impossible -- for Jackson's lawyers.\n \"If there's a pattern to their fabrication of claims, then that pattern could easily be admissible,\" Cavise said.\n Kling, the Kent professor, acknowledges that the information raises more questions about the accusations, but he isn't sure it's Jackson's silver bullet.\n Also, the boy's father could pose credibility problems if Jackson opts to use him to discredit his wife. He was sentenced to domestic-violence counseling after pleading no contest to charges that he beat her. He also has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of willful cruelty to a child in an incident involving his daughter, Newsweek reported.\n \"I don't see a pattern of frivolous lawsuits; I see a dysfunctional family,\" Kling said. \"Certainly there's a lot of potential fodder for cross-examination, but the two suits have nothing to do with sexual abuse [involving the boy]. They show a lack of normal functioning on the part of his mom.\"\n Kling said \"he would be smiling a lot\" right now if he were Jackson's attorney, but \"until such time that we see what the evidence is,\" you just don't know.\n \n It only gets weirder\n Jackson's accuser, according to Newsweek and People magazines, appeared in a British documentary with Jackson in which the singer admitted sleeping in his bed at Neverland with children in a nonsexual manner.\n The boy met Jackson a few years ago with the help of Jamie Masada, a Los Angeles comedy club owner who runs a camp to teach needy kids about comedy. At that point, Masada said doctors were giving the boy, now believed to be 13, only a few weeks to live. Meeting Jackson was one of his dreams.\n The allegations against Jackson were related by the boy to a therapist, who was required by law to notify authorities.\n Masada said last week that the cancer-stricken teen is seriously ill again. He has only one kidney and is awaiting a transplant because his remaining kidney is failing.\n The boy's poor health adds yet another level of bizarreness to the case. If it goes to trial, Kling predicts a three-ring circus that could make the murder trial of O.J. Simpson \"look like a Sunday school kindergarten class.\"\n Jackson's Web site, both Cavise and Kling said, is an indicator that Jackson's defense team is trying to sway a potential jury that undoubtedly will bring preconceived notions about him into court.\n \"If this case went to trial tomorrow, I don't think you could possibly find a fair jury,\" Cavise said. \"If the guy's public profile is killing him right now, it's part of his lawyer's job to change that.\"\n Jackson says on mjnews.us that he's trying to avoid the spotlight.\n \"We will not engage in speculation,\" he writes. \"We will not provide running commentary on every new development or allegation dujour. We intend to try our case in the courtroom, not in the public or the media.\"\n A gag order could go out soon, temporarily ending all chatter by key players. But until it's all over, \"there's nothing that's going to be usual about this case because it's Michael Jackson,\" Kling said.\"\n \n hmmm.. something to think about... totally sounds like a money hungry family, if they have already done this before on different accounts why would this time be any different? They just want money... the father is on Michael's side too",

It still does not mean it is sexual... I find nothing wrong with it, I guess that makes me a child molester. I have many people who can back me up on this that find there is nothing wrong with sharing your bed with someone... children or not. It's not a big deal, it's just sleeping. Yes he paid 20 million dollars for the last time to the family but he has said that he only did it because he did not want a long drawn out trial on TV like OJ... I mean if u were the parent of the \"victim\" you would not stop at 20 million... you would want the person put in JAIL for what they did to your child.

This was what you said:\n \n \nAGAIN, Michael does not ASK the kids to stay... the children ask to stay with him... he asks the parents first if it is alright with them and then gives THE kid the bed and he sleeps on the floor.\n \n \n You were speaking in general? What does that mean? Generally he does not sleep with children? Generally speaking, you seem to be a recovering brain donor. Let me ask you something...are you generally aware of the interview with wacko jacko where he states that he shares his bed with children frequently? Are you generally aware that he stated that it is a loving thing to do, that there is nothing more loving than sharing your bed with a child? Generally speaking, I think he was stating that he sleeps with kids. So your statement that he sleeps on the floor and gives the bed to the kids is generally wrong. \n \n \nthen whatever suspicions you have are worthless... you can't prove it. He has not been proven guilty, that's evidence enough in itself that he is innocent.\n \n \n Suspicions are the reason he is under arrest. The fact that he has not been proven guilty yet has no bearing on his guilt or innocence. He has not been judged in a court of law yet. Legally speaking, he is innocent until proven guilty, but he is suspected of having commited the crimes he was arrested for. This means that there will be a decision on his guilt or innocence in the future. The fact that he is innocent until proven guilty is not \"evidence\" as you suggest. Choose your words carefully. If it was evidence, the defense could stand up in court and say \"well judge...he has not been proven guilty, so he obviously did not commit the crime.\" The only thing that innocent until proven guilty means is that he has not been convicted of a crime yet.",

They have scammed at least 3 other families for money and Michael is a very easy target BECAUSE of what happened last time and also because he is viewed as odd and eccentric.

Remember the man didn't even have a childhood... I guess I'll say it again:\n When Michael was 5, he started singing in the Jackson Five... he was in the recording studio for hours on end. He'd dance, he'd sing... all day and all night, that was all he was allowed to do. He'd look out the window of the recording studio and he'd see kids playing baseball in the park, on the swings... he'd want more than anything to go out there and live his childhood. But all through his child years, teen years, late 20s, 30s, even 40s... he's been working tremendously. He never had time to live his childhood. With Neverland, he is trying to recreate that time in his life he wants to get back.... the reason for inviting kids over is because when he was their age he didn't get to play, but now he can live his childhood. Now that he is up to the status he wanted to fufill he can finally sit back, relax and try and relive this part of his life. Think about what u were doing when u were 5-14... u weren't thinking about where ur next meal was coming from.... u weren't working ur XXX off and getting abused for not doing something right. You were playing, having a good time... living your childhood. That's all that Michael is doing... he is just trying to relive his childhood... leave the poor man alone.",

   "A statement from a fellow MJ fan... this is his letter to the world\n \n STATEMENT TO THE WORLD: Michael Jackson \n \n To: The World \n \n Dear world, \n \n The rumours, the speculation, the slander and the humiliation has got to stop against Michael Jackson. It just isn't fair. Just because he has had plastic surgery, just because his skin has lost pigmentation and just because he has an affection for children, this DOES NOT make him a paedophile. \n \n The affection this man has for children is amazing - he treats them with so much respect and dignity, where a lot parents put off their children at every opportunity in place of work, socialising and boredom. \n \n The list compiled below, fairly justifies the belief in Michael Jackson's 100% innocence: (All true - no false info) \n \n - Michael has so much respect for people, and is selfless \n - He spends his time raising money for charities and is the biggest-donating celebrity ever recorded \n - His mother recounts that he would 'cry' when watching starving children on the television \n - The 1993 case was a conspiracy for money - yet people don't remember this \n - Why would Michael Jackson introduce a child he molested on several occasions to a British journalist filming an interview to be shown worldwide? \n - The mother of the child involved has been involved in several other lawsuits of sexual molestation \n - A great deal of Michael's songs are written about world peace, healing and the world situation \n - Because of his love for kids all over the world, this the only bad thing they can pin on him - and because of his affection, and because of the 'balcony' incident, people believe he's a molester automatically - without reviewing or knowing the facts - and this is wrong \n - Prosecutor Tom Sneddon has no fondness whatsoever for Jackson, who wrote a song 'D.S.' about him, released 1995 \n - Why did the court put a 'gag order' on Michael in 1993? If he was guilty, he would remain silent - and if he wasn't then he would attempt to proclaim his innocence further. But because of this, he couldn't \n - The mother of the child consulted the same psychiatrist and same lawyer as the child in 1993 \n - The people who know Michael have said he would never hurt a child - it's only the people who don't know him saying these things \n - An authentically verified memo sent by child welfare said that the child making the allegations had an unfounded case against the entertainer \n - The last people got money out of Michael - why can't someone else have a shot at it? \n - The family involved said that Michael had never molested their son - just after the Bashir documentary aired \n - The boy's father said the boy's mother is unstable and that he doesn't believe Jackson molested his son \n - A lot of people will do anything for money \n - They delayed the charges against Michael for a MONTH because they had to set up a WEBSITE \n - A victim's family can receive money in what is known as restitution. The offender must pay the amount of restitution or he/she may face additional criminal charges. The restitution is set by the judge at sentencing. This doesn't require a civil lawsuit and is set by the prosecution. This way, the family could get money off Jackson without being accused of a conspiracy \n \n So I leave it with you. But surely this gross amount of information supporting Michael Jackson gives him the right to a fair trial - in public opinion and in the court of law? \n \n If you don't think so, then, in my opinion, you are not being fair. I ask you to think about how you would feel in his situation - especially if he is innocent. \n \n Thank you for reading this statement, \n \n TOM MCGREGOR\n \n Something to think about, Tom makes very good points and I 100% agree with him.",

There was doo doo, feces thrown all over the walls, the floor, the ceiling. And it stunk so bad. Then one of the policemen came by the window. And he made a sarcastic remark.

   "One must be really stupid daring to ventilate that MJ is a child-abuser while on the other hand that one is 2 lazy 2 read the articles...\n \n MJ history in short:\n \n 1. MJ has to work more than would be desirable as a small boy, and is treated poorly.\n 2. MJ goes solo and earns millions with his music.\n 3. With the millions he can not only buy things to enjoy for himself, but also for OTHER children like him who didn't / don't have a 'good' youth. Or for sick children. I can only see a positive side of this.\n 4. Because some a$$$$$hole see opportunities to tackle some dollars out of his pocket, and wreck some childrens (like: your own son) life while doing that, MJ gets some very bad publicity. There's not a piece of mind in me that think he's molested any child. It was a wrong impulse of MJ to dangle his baby over a balcony. Although he did it to 'please' the crowd, he better could not have done that, of course. But, everybody makes (sometimes big) mistakes. Only, at MJ there's a thousand of camera's and very very dirty criminal tabloids (who JUST wants to sell) on it because the media can make so much money out of MJ's life. Just as many other famous people. Probably if MJ had a better youth he wouldn't have dangling a baby over the balcony. There are many many people who do also (be it more or less) dangerous things with their children. That doesn't make them child-abusers! If all parents who dropped their baby on the floor were to be jailed, there woudn't be one-million but ten-million people imprisoned in the US. It was also wrong for MJ to pay the parents of the first child victim (being victim of his parent(s): just used as a blackmail weapon). MJ's lawyers obviously made the very very big mistake to think the case would then 'go away', or at least not to take it into court. MJ probably tried to prevent the boy from having to participate in many horrible court-sessions. That they BLACKMAILED MJ for 20 million dollars, doesn't prove ANY abuse-thing what-so-ever. However, it's proven that Chandler (the father) and Rothman are criminals themselfs. Rothman has manipulated many people who still have to get ten?s-Of-thousands of dollars from him.\n \n Some people are scared of by his skin-disorder and/or some plastic surgery or some other 'uncommon' characteristics. That's not a reason to think he's a child-abuser. There's not much difference if you let your child sleep at the homes of some of his friends (you don't have any supervision then, do you?) or at MJ's house (with his doors open). Anyway, i think it's ridicilous to think MJ has abused children, just because some parents are after a piece of MJ's dollars. With this new case the child has to learn all kinds of rubbish to remember for court, all made up by the already known mentally derailed parent(s). \n \n There's a alligator/snake catcher, called 'Steve'. He has been very very close to alligators with his baby. If Bindi's friends came over to sleep in the same room with Steve or Terri, and Steve or Terri had also a skin-disorder and plastic surgery, would some of you paranoiacs also think (s)he's a child molester?\n \n The people who think MJ is a child-abuser, just haven't read on. The only thing they have read is other people's (who also didn't read anything) false opinion or some criminal tabloids. It's just as with the Germans in WWII... Very very many blindly and brainwashed emoticon_wow followed Hitler, without thinking for themselfs. Chandler has kidnapped, drugged, misused and forced his son to get millions from MJ, Rothman planned much of it and he's known to be a very big crook, faker, thief and fraud. On the other hand, there isn't ANY evidence againt MJ, and ALL people who have met MJ besides the ones who are taking him to court (or try to settle for millions), speak for MJ.\n \n As for MJ's music, I don't have any MJ-CD's and i am not a MJ-fan. I've got about 10 MJ-mp3z, but then again i've about 4000 mp3z...",

   "wait... what the hell did u say? \"Is he has never\" I'll just disregard that and answer stuff that actually MADE any sort of sense.\n \n Yes he has fair skin because of the pigment disorder... and ur point would be? Bruises would show up better but fair or dark THOSE brusies would show up NO MATTER WHAT your skin tone is.\n \n Glad u also brought up the point of when Mike came out of the police station waving and flashing the peace sign. When he left the station yeah he was waving but he was doing it to show us fans that he was ok becuase he didnt want us to know he was hurting. If he had left the police station crying and in pain it would have LET THE MEDIA WIN. The point is, he may have been hurting but he wasn't going to SHOW it. This was the time where he needed to show the fans and the haters that \"YEA IM ALRIGHT AND IM INNOCENT! This trial is gonna be a piece of cake! They aint got ANYTHING on me!\" He didn't want to show the horrible pain he was in. Also, besides that he still might have been IN SHOCK from it and therefore the pain would set in later on. In a car accident you may have a neck brace put on you even if ur not complaining of any pain because you are still in shock but those HOURS later u will start to feel it. I believe MJ on this... he said it keeps him up late and he cannot sleep because of his shoulder. The police WOULD do this... many accounts of racist acts by the police. Not saying all police DO this but there are MANY accounts of it.\n\n \n Are you serious sparkle? If he really had a dislocated shoulder as he claimed, he would not have been able to lift his arm up at all. And as far as pain, he would have been in substantial pain immediately upon it being dislocated. And that is not what \"shock\" really is. Shock has nothing to do with it. You are really misinformed on this subject. There is no way if his shoulder was dislocated as he says that he could raise his arms and wave like he did, it is physically impossible. And the pictures that you posted are hilarious. Do you honestly think that handcuffs could do that? Those pictures did not show handcuff injuries.

   "Ya know, I was just waiting for someone to bring up the case way back when in 1993, where Michael was accused of molesting a 12 year old boy, Jordy Chandler. I am going to post this article that tells u WAY more than I could say...and probably a lot nicer too ;) I'm only going to include major facts because this article is over 4 pages long.\n \"Was Michael Jackson Framed?\"\n Jackson's troubles began when his van broke down on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles in May 1992. Stranded in the middle of the heavily trafficked street, Jackson was spotted by the wife of Mel Green, an employee at Rent-a-Wreck, an offbeat car-rental agency a mile away. Green went to the rescue. When Dave Schwartz, the owner of the car-rental company, heard Green was bringing Jackson to the lot, he called his wife, June, and told her to come over with their 6-year-old daughter and her son from her previous marriage. The boy, then 12, was a big Jackson fan. Upon arriving, June Chandler Schwartz told Jackson about the time her son had sent him a drawing after the singer's hair caught on fire during the filming of a Pepsi commercial. Then she gave Jackson their home number. \n \n \"It was almost like she was forcing [the boy] on him,\" Green recalls. \"I think Michael thought he owed the boy something, and that's when it all started.\"And while it may be unusual for a 35-year-old man to have sleepovers with a 13-year-old child, the boy's mother and others close to Jackson never thought it odd. Jackson's behavior is better understood once it's put in the context of his own childhood. \"Contrary to what you might think, Michael's life hasn't been a walk in the park,\" one of his attorneys says. Jackson's childhood essentially stopped -- and his unorthodox life began -- when he was 5 years old and living in Gary, Indiana.\n Months later, Chandler returned to L.A. with his wife and held a series of dentistry jobs. By 1980, when their son was born, the couple's marriage was in trouble. \"One of the reasons June left Evan was because of his temper,\" a family friend says. They divorced in 1985. The court awarded sole custody of the boy to his mother and ordered Chandler to pay $500 a month in child support, but a review of documents reveals that in 1993, when the Jackson scandal broke, Chandler owed his ex-wife $68,000 -- a debt she ultAt first, Chandler welcomed and encouraged his son's relationship with Michael Jackson, bragging about it to friends and associates. When Jackson and the boy stayed with Chandler during May 1993, Chandler urged the entertainer to spend more time with his son at his house. According to sources, Chandler even suggested that Jackson build an addition onto the house so the singer could stay there. After calling the zoning department and discovering it couldn't be done, Chandler made another suggestion -- that Jackson just build him a new home. (my personal opinion right here, WHAT THE HELL IS UP WITH EVAN?! ASKING SUCH A SWEET AND INNOCENT MAN TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON THEM! What a greedy butthead!!) At no time has Chandler claimed to have witnessed any sexual misconduct on Jackson's part. \n \n Chandler became increasingly volatile, making threats that alienated Jackson, Dave Schwartz and June Chandler Schwartz. In early July 1993, Dave Schwartz, who had been friendly with Chandler, secretly tape-recorded a lengthy telephone conversation he had with him. During the conversation, Chandler talked of his concern for his son and his anger at Jackson and at his ex-wife, whom he described as \"cold and heartless.\" When Chandler tried to \"get her attention\" to discuss his suspicions about Jackson, he says on the tape, she told him \"Go **** yourself.\" \"We were friends. I liked him and I respected him and everything else for what he is. There was no reason why he had to stop calling me. I sat in the room one day and talked to Michael and told him exactly what I want out of this whole relationship. What I want.\" \n \n Admitting to Schwartz that he had \"been rehearsed\" about what to say and what not to say, Chandler never mentioned money during their conversation. When Schwartz asked what Jackson had done that made Chandler so upset, Chandler alleged only that \"he broke up the family. [The boy] has been seduced by this guy's power and money.\" Both men repeatedly berated themselves as poor fathers to the boy. Elsewhere on the tape, Chandler indicated he was prepared to move against Jackson: \"It's already set,\" Chandler told Schwartz. \"There are other people involved that are waiting for my phone call that are in certain positions. I've paid them to do it. Everything's going according to a certain plan that isn't just mine. Once I make that phone call, this guy [his attorney, Barry K. Rothman, presumably] is going to destroy everybody in sight in any devious, nasty, cruel way that he can \n do it. And I've given him full authority to do that.\" \n \n Chandler then predicted what would, in fact, transpire six weeks later: \"And if I go through with this, I win big-time. There's no way I lose. I've checked that inside out. I will get everything I want, and they will be destroyed forever. June will lose [custody of the son]...and Michael's career will be over.\" \n (another personal comment, EVAN IS SOOOO EVIL!!!)\"Does that help [the boy]?\" Schwartz asked. \n \n \"That's irrelevant to me,\" Chandler replied. \"It's going to be bigger than all of us put together. The whole thing is going to crash down on everybody and destroy everybody in sight. It will be a massacre if I don't get what I want.\" \n THAT IS ONLY PART OF THE ARTICLE!! Just a little glimpse...If you would like to read the full article go to... http://members.aol.com/mjnfc/pagetwo.html\n Also I would like to add that when Jordy Chandler was told what to say, he was under the influence of heavy drugs that his father injected in him so that he could gain as much from this...disregarding his son...just using his son as a way to ruin Michael.\n ALSO\n His music is NOT some stupid pop music, like Britney Spears. He puts thought into his lyrics and its just SO wonderful!! He writes his own songs, starts new trends, donates more money to charity then anyone else!!, and of course loves what he does and is a genius of the past, present, and future.\n\n \n \n I actually took the time to read this because I knew there was going to be a lot of stuff in here I could argue about. For one, read this line that was in the article: \n \"It was almost like she was forcing [the boy] on him,\" Green recalls. And while it may be unusual for a 35-year-old man to have sleepovers with a 13-year-old child, the boy's mother and others close to Jackson never thought it odd.\n What kind of mom would do that? You actually believe that a mom would try to \"hook up\" Michael Jackson with her 13 year old boy? That's pretty sick. And then to believe that she encouraged him to sleep over Michael's house? Are you kidding me? I want to know from what bogus source did you get that article...possibly GayMenThatLookLikeGirls.com? I think you are just blind to the fact that he did it. He molested a kid. He paid the family millions of dollars to settle out of court. You just refuse to believe it. I like many of his songs, but he is a freaky, child molesting sicko.",

He said he would find her and kill her. I'm not sure if she had them copyrighted... I'll have to ask her but I think ur right... she will end up paying more in lawyer fees than money she could collect from the settlement.",

   "Are you serious sparkle? If he really had a dislocated shoulder as he claimed, he would not have been able to lift his arm up at all. And as far as pain, he would have been in substantial pain immediately upon it being dislocated. And that is not what \"shock\" really is. Shock has nothing to do with it. You are really misinformed on this subject. There is no way if his shoulder was dislocated as he says that he could raise his arms and wave like he did, it is physically impossible. And the pictures that you posted are hilarious. Do you honestly think that handcuffs could do that? Those pictures did not show handcuff injuries. I have seen handcuff injuries before, and those are not it.\n\n \n Well you never seen anyone like michael either...all white and looks like a cranium.......and the guy is skinny as a broomstick, he may be more sore than regular people....but what do i know.\n anyway, i do know that a dislocated shoulder is no big deal...it's worse for some than for other...and hey, the guuy have been a star since he was 5 he never went to school, maybe he doesnt know what it means to dislocate a shoulder.\n But like i said. what do i know",
