As a member of the Council of Europe, Poland is obliged to abide by the court's judgments.\n \n The Polish government has three months to appeal the verdict.\n\n The involvement of the Roman Catholic Church in Poland is an interesting case. My folks imigrated to the US from Poland, so I have some familiarity. Besides the fact that the great majority of Poles are Roman Catholic, the Church was strongly involved in anti-communist efforts during the Communist period in Poland and was the one such organization that was marginally tolerated by that government. Therefore, it came out with a lot of political clout once Communism fell and used that clout to influence conservative government social policy - including that on abortion. Some of my more progressive Polish friends bemoan that influence. It will be interesting to watch how the socially conservative government will have to compromise to fit into the EU - which can only be a good influence, in my opinion, where social policy is concerned.",

   "Abortion has parallels to bullying, so it is no wonder that the the EU is now bullying Poland into permitting abortion, they did the same to Portugal. \n \n Communism is back in Europe.\n\n It is the Catholic Church in Poland which is bullying its population by forcing abortion to be outlawed in a country where most would keep it legal (as it had been under Communist times). Some Polish polls on abortion I found in a quick Google search include:\n \n http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?hint=2&DR_ID=41652 notes that \"a survey conducted in November found that three out of four Poles said abortion was either 'acceptable under some conditions' or 'in any circumstances,' while 18% said they were completely against the procedure, Reuters reports.\"\n \n Also, http://www.federa.org.pl/english/report97/analysis.htm notes that \"83 per cent of the responding women are of the opinion that abortion should be permitted on the woman's demand\"\n \n Anyway, this shows that it is the Catholic Church which is the one doing the bullying. It is a touchy issue in Poland since most people consider themselves Catholic and the church still holds some political clout due to its previous anti-communist involvement but, from what I've heard from friends in Poland, that clout is disappearing as people get sick of the Church pushing its conservative weight around.",

   "The shop is not dependent on you as the religious parties are dependent on the Church or Poland is dependent on EU funding. If you were a regular customer and the store was dependent on you to some degree and you told them you were no longer going to be a customer because of something they did, then that would be bullying on a small scale. When people boycott stores, that is also bullying.\n\n \n I was talking about the company that makes the bars. The company's rely on me too, but I can't be blamed for not funding them merely because I choose not too. I have no obligation to buy their bars, just as the church has no obligation to fund parties that don't represent their view. The EU should not take taxes from Poland if it is not going to fund it, withholding funds is bullying, people will suffer. \n \n What is amazing about all this is the fact you where not willing to show the EU as a bully but you rushed out to show the Church as one, and it turns out the opposite is true.\n \n You are never going to concede are you despite obviously being wrong, this is going to go on and on.",

   "Hey! Looks like Polish president Lech Kaczynsky and his wife Maria Kaczynska are about to be involved in another great scandal. In April of this year, the first lady spoke in opposition to a constitutional amendment to protect human life from the moment of conception and came out in support of more liberal abortion law in Poland - that's exactly the reason why Radio Maryja station's founder, the outspoken Redemptorist Father Tadeusz Rydzyk, called Maria Kaczynska a \"witch who should be euthanized.\" \n \n Why on earth did she do so? Perhaps, she is planning to make a pretty penny out this abortion law by means of supplies of abortive materials to the US? I used to read on the Internet, that some experiments on human embryos are conducted in secret laboratories of the Pentagon in order to create new types of biological-warfare weapon under cover of researches for life prolongation and age-related diseases treatment. There, in America they don't have enough abortive materials for this purpose, and Lech Kaczynsky together with his wife Maria proffered their help to Washington and therefore are pushing a new abortion amendment despite their promises before the 2005 elections. How hideous of them! You see, the Kaczynskys will easily override common humane principals just in order to line their pockets and toady Americans!",
