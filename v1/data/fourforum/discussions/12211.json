   "Amalia Dominguez was 18 and desperate and knew exactly what to ask for at the small, family-run pharmacy in the heart of Washington Heights, the thriving Dominican enclave in northern Manhattan. \"I need to bring down my period,\" she recalled saying in Spanish, using a euphemism that the pharmacist understood instantly.\n \n It was 12 years ago, but the memory remains vivid: She was handed a packet of pills. They were small and white, $30 for 12. Ms. Dominguez, two or three months pregnant, went to a friend's apartment and swallowed the pills one by one, washing them down with malta, a molasseslike extract sold in nearly every bodega in the neighborhood.\n \n The cramps began several hours later, doubling Ms. Dominguez over, building and building until, eight and a half hours later, she locked herself in the bathroom and passed a lifeless fetus, which she flushed. \n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/nyregion/05abortion.html\n \n Dominguez is black. And poor. She's never going to receive a Republican bailout. Chances are remotely possible that she'll receive a Democratic bailout.\n \n Had she borne a child?\n \n What would have become of that child?\n \n Who would have opened their hearts -- and purses -- to that child?\n \n For, once beyond the fetal state, existing outside of the womb, who would have cared?\n \n Only Democrats. Feminists. But they were being gunned down by the rabid right.",

   "Commentary from letter writers on this article:\n \nYour article underscores the fact that after 36 years of legal abortion, some women still struggle to obtain reproductive health care because they don't understand or trust the American medical system.\n \n In my Washington Heights clinic in northern Manhattan, I see at least one patient every week who has tried to end a pregnancy on her own. When lack of information, poverty or stigma overwhelm pregnant women, some take matters into their own hands....\n \n Many women struggle to raise the money for an abortion as their pregnancy progresses. Sixty-seven percent of poor women having an abortion report that they would have preferred to have an earlier procedure....\n \n Your article points out that for some women abortion care has not changed in more than 100 years. ... In the 1800s, newspapers and the religious press in the United States carried ads for medicines that would cure \"blocked\" menstruation. Such ads stated that the product should not be used by married ladies. This was a code that the product could cause an abortion, thus telling women who wanted to end a pregnancy to buy the product....\n \n Your article is an excellent reminder of the struggles facing poor women who seek basic reproductive health care in this country. Because of a law called the Hyde Amendment, which was first enacted in 1976 and renewed each year since, women on Medicaid are not covered for the cost of an abortion.\n \n Unlike other basic health needs for men and women, this procedure, which nearly one-third of all women in the United States will have by the end of their reproductive years, is specifically carved out of coverage. For poor women in Washington Heights, paying $30 for a risky and illegal drug is much more realistic than paying several hundred dollars (or much more) for a legal abortion out of their own pockets....\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/12/opinion/l12abort.html\n \n Poverty and pregnancy.\n \n Hatred of women and equality for women. Hatred of feminists who would raise the economic status of women.\n \n Denying women the right to own and control their own bodies.\n \n No ownership society for women when they can't even claim autonomy over their own bodies.",

Such a double standard would then make readers lose respect for your moral stance.\n \n 2) Even anticonceptive precautions fail ~1% of the time so responsible sexuality does not guarantee protection from an unwanted pregnancy.\n \n 3) If, either through irresponsible sexuality or bad luck of failed contraceptives, a woman gets an unwanted pregnancy, then the decision of whether or not she should be allowed to get an abortion should not depend on how she got pregnant but on general factors of rights of woman over her own body vs potential rights of the fetus. Indeed, if a woman did get pregnant through irresponsibility, then that would only ADD to the arguement of her getting an abortion since there would be a bigger risk of her being an irresponsible parent than if she simply got pregnant through bad luck of failed contraceptives.",

Even most married pro-life couples do not have sex for the purpose of procreation but have sex for the emotional bond and/or pleasure of it. Even animals do not engage in sex for the purpose of procreation but because chemical reactions in their bodies drive a sexual emotional need. They are certainly not thinking \"I want to have sex now for the purpose of having offspring in the near future\". The emotions surrounding sex may well have been built into us through the Evolutionary process to aid in the propogation of the species, but to ignore the fact that it is the emotional drive that determines sex, not the purposes of procreation, is to severely misunderstand how nature works.\n \n Therefore, what is \"natural\" is to have sex when emotions drive you to have sex. One can claim that it is unnatural to abstain from sex when one desires it since nature would not have us abstain - just as animals certainly do not abstain from sex. There are many things that are \"natural\" (i.e. that are built into our instincts and automatic reactions that most animals engage in) that are certainly not considered \"good\" - killing someone who strongly angers you, stealing, etc. Therefore, I would not use \"natural\" as a goal if I were you. There are just too many arguements against people doing what is natural. The clear advantages of the human condition is that we can use reason and judgement to have control over our natural impulses. Where abortion is concerned, we obviously have a disagreement about the reasoned conclusions about abortion rights but to claim that the \"natural\" answer is the right one is illogical when \"natural\" is so often a bad answer.",

Of course, I am sure that we continue to disagree as to what the viable responsible options are when it comes to handling an unwanted pregnancy but, as you would agree, that discussion is independent from the discussion about the responsibility people have to not get pregnant in the first place.\n\n \n Actually I think we agree on the responsible options for handling an unwanted pregnancy. \n \n Basically we both feel that once a human is valued (I use value to mean something like it has a right to live) than the responsible thing to do is care for the baby until born. The difference seems to be what is valued (again I use that term very broadly). I think a human is always valued while you give value to some level of brain function.",

I think a human is always valued while you give value to some level of brain function.\n\n Yes, I would agree that we both do set limits on abortion rights once the human is valued. However, I would state my view as only valuing human bodies once there is a \"somebody\" in them. Since I view the core of the existence of people as their mental existence then, yes, in our current understanding of the source of mentality, that involves sufficient brain function. However, if one could prove to me that a mental existence could exist without brain function (ex. a soul) then brain function would be irrelevant. It is the mental existence I value - the mental existence that determines the existence (in my view) of a person. Brain function is secondary and important only in the sense that it achieves that mental function. Unless I have misunderstood your view all along, you value human bodies whether or not they have \"somebody home\" - it is the human life itself that you value, not any existing mentality.",

   "A couple of points need to be made:\n 1) First, though I agree with you that people should act more responsibly where their sexuality is concerned, it should be pointed out that, as Simone implied, when you only criticize one partner, it does seem that you are presenting an illogical double standard of morality. Such a double standard would then make readers lose respect for your moral stance.\n \n 2) Even anticonceptive precautions fail ~1% of the time so responsible sexuality does not guarantee protection from an unwanted pregnancy.\n \n 3) If, either through irresponsible sexuality or bad luck of failed contraceptives, a woman gets an unwanted pregnancy, then the decision of whether or not she should be allowed to get an abortion should not depend on how she got pregnant but on general factors of rights of woman over her own body vs potential rights of the fetus. Indeed, if a woman did get pregnant through irresponsibility, then that would only ADD to the arguement of her getting an abortion since there would be a bigger risk of her being an irresponsible parent than if she simply got pregnant through bad luck of failed contraceptives.\n\n Thank you, Another Opinion.
