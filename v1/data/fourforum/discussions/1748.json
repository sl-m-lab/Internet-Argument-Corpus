   "It seems to me that what we need is not less nudity but more thoughtful, clean nudity. Similarly, there is basically just a certain type of violence that is harmful. \n \n Take Britney Spears, for instance. Her first video was fairly sexy in a fairly clean way, so she deservedly became popular. All she had to do to remain popular was to wear sexy clothes, sing a little, and stay fairly clean looking. She couldn't do the last part, and so she is less popular now. \n \n I often find myself surprised at how dumb the media is in portraying sex. All they would have to do to produce sexy shows is to put on the screen pretty, clean, affectionate girls in sexy bikinis (or less). But nooooo, they forever have to make affectionate girls and women dirty-looking and screwed-up. There is nothing wrong with nudity. Obviously attractive females are much more appealing and interesting to men if they are nude. But on cable, when a female is nude, you can pretty much expect her to be sleezy-looking and that it is just a short time before she has sex or sodomy with some galoot for some stupid idiotic reason. Not that I particularly want to see on TV a female having sex with someone anyway; I'd prefer just to see her nude, though it's hard to be certain since all portrayals of sex on TV are disgusting for external reasons anyway. Where are the mistresses in the movies who have sex because they rightly love the deserving male they are having sex with? One could expect pornographers to be prudish if one didn't know better, because certainly they superfluosly belittle females who care greatly about real (clean)sexual pleasure (either their own or their mate's)--mistresses are never portrayed as moral.\n \n The kind of violence that bothers me is the kind which domineering males like to use to make those they dominate more afraid of them. Abusive types who like to dominate through physical violence have a need to make those they abuse think them more dangerous than they really are. Thus, these males like, for example, to take their girlfriends to mindless slasher movies starring murderers vaguely like themselves so their girlfriends will think not just that their boyfriends want to dominate them, but that under certain circumstances of disobedience they would enjoy killing them. This delusion if present in the girl can make the abuser's physical abuse more controlling, because obviously girls don't like to get killed. What happens on occasion is that the lies which the media makes to feed the wicked needs of thuggish males end up fooling the thuggish males themselves. On occasion a thug believes not only that he wants to dominate, but that also that he wants to kill, which is what makes most serial killers. Serial killers don't by nature enjoy killing, but because they are dumb they sometimes believe the lies that they encourage for the delusions of others, and so on occasion they come to believe that somehow they profit by killing people for no reason when in fact they are just likely to earn a death sentence.\n \n On the other hand, there is a great deal of frustration in society, and many people have violent cruel feelings under the surface because at some insane level they feel they are being forcibly abused and molested. This sort of mindless violence (e.g., females acting too cruel for insane reasons of excessive cleanliness) on TV doesn't really bother me--in fact, insane violence seems more insane the more one considers it, so looking at such violence in a way can calm one down by making you realize how it is basically silly. And it might scare abusive males some, which I suppose is all for the good.",

   "I understand what you are saying, step314, but I disagree. While you may be older and more wise in the ways of the world, what about the impressionable young boys and girls in grade school? For Pete's sake, all of the studies (which I typically don't pay attention to but do find grains of truth in) show a rise in underage pregnancies, sex, drinking, violent crimes, and drug use. People tend to underestimate the power of the media, thinking that kids will not copy what they see. While in no way am I saying that violent video games lead to killing sprees, I worry more about the \"realistic\" shows that are on Network and Cable TV during primetime. While we may tell that they are fake and absolutely contrary to real life, kids believe what they are told because they are young and their minds are growing and assimilating all of the information they can.",

And obviously, parents should just watch the t.v. all the time so they can turn it off when something raunchy comes on.\n\n \n The halftime show was a fluke, this is not an everyday occurance. It was deliberate and deplorable. It deserved to be fined. Shows like NYPD Blue et all...are a different story. Some even have warnings at the start of their show stating that some of the content may be objectionable to some. I totally agree....use the damn on/off switch. I happen to like shows like this. If you take it off the air, I can't enjoy it anymore. If you turn it off, you don't have to see it. Or better yet, change the channel. There is bound to be something on you find enjoyable and wholesome. Personally, I can't stand the \"christian\" networks, nor the home shopping networks...so I don't watch them. As far as protecting our children from \"morally questionable\" television, that is the sole responsibility of the parents. Superbowl aside, (again...not a relevant example) any RESPONSIBLE parent should be concerned with what their children are watching...let's face it...some of the programming is not meant for children. TV's now have channel blocking technology that can allow parents to block certain channels...many TV's can even be deactivated to all channels unless you enter a code for them. If a parent is that concerned, they need to explore this technology. (I still think the on/off button is the best answer...low tech rules). Network, cable, whatever...it is all one thing...an entertainment venue. You may not find some of it entertaining or worthwhile programming, but I might. If people cannot control what their children are watching on television, they have bigger problems than some \"offensive\" programs.",
