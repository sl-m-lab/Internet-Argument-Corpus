   "All this negativity towards gays and lesbians comes from two things....Fear of what people do not understand and two the good ole bible.\n \n Here is an interesting article I found awahile back and bookmarked. Glad I am getting to use it.\n \n http://www.bibble.org/gay/phobia/roots_of_homophobia.html\n \n I have also cut and pasted a section from \"The letter to louise\" from www.godmademegay.com. The writer of this is a baptist minister who invites people to share this letter. I have only chosen the part that pertains to your question.\n \n \n Six. Homosexuals are being sinned against by our churches. Like our society, our churches need to change.\n \n \"Kill a ***** for Christ\"\n \n \n \n I added the italics, foolishly; what italics are needed for such a statement. In your small town you probably have not seen that cleverly alliterative bumper sticker. For you and me it is unbelievable, unreal. Sadly, it is very real.\n \n \n \n The thinking shown in the bumper sticker and the position of many churches and their pastors abets the crimes against gays and lesbians. Peter Gomes, Professor of Christian Morals at Harvard, says, \"The combination of ignorance and prejudice under the guise of morality makes the religious community, and its abuse of scripture in this regard, itself morally culpable.\"6-1 He relates this:\n \n In preparing for her novel The Drowning of Stephen Jones, based upon the true story of a young gay man tossed from a bridge to his death by a group of young gay-bashers, author Bette Greene interviewed more than four hundred young men in jail for various forms of gay-bashing. Few of the men, she noted, showed any remorse for their crimes. Few saw anything morally wrong with their crimes, and more than a few of them told her that they were justified in their opinions and in their actions by the religious traditions from which they came. Homosexuality was wrong and against the Bible. One of those interviewed told her that the pastor of his church had said that homosexuals represented Satan and the Devil. The implication of his logic was clear: Who could possibly do wrong in destroying Satan and all of his works? The legitimization of violence against homosexuals and Jews and women and blacks, as we have seen, comes from the view that the Bible stigmatizes these people, thereby making them fair game. If the Bible expresses such a prejudice, then it certainly cannot be wrong to act on that prejudice. This is the argument every anti-Semite and racist has used with demonstrably devastating consequences, as our social history all too vividly shows.6-2\n \n \n \n When the funeral of Matt Shepard (above) was held, a Baptist preacher from Kansas with sympathizers from several states were there marching in front of the funeral site with placards reading, \"God Hates Fags\" and \"*** Matt in Hell.\" It is some consolation to know that the people of the town formed themselves into a wall between the marchers and the family, and when the marchers began to cry out their messages, the people sang \"Amazing Grace.\" (\"***,\" short for \"XXXXXX,\" originated several centuries ago in Europe when people who had engaged in same-gender sex were burned at the stake.)\n \n \n \n In the summer of 1998 fundamentalist Christian organizations, fearful of the consideration by some states of recognizing same-gender marriage, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on ads in major newspapers telling the nation that gays and lesbians are \"sick\" and \"sinful,\" that they can and should be \"cured,\" and that their rights and protections should be denied.6-3\n \n \n \n Louise, one of the first things I realized when I started to think about this subject was that the millions of gays and lesbians in this nation will never, with few exceptions, darken the doors of our churches, because they know our attitude toward them is one of hatred and condemnation. Is \"hatred\" too strong a word? A few years ago a Baptist church in Austin ordained a homosexual, and the leaders of the Baptist General Convention of Texas asked the church to disassociate itself from the Convention. The next day The Dallas Morning News ran this two-column headline: \"Baptist General Convention Reasserts Its Hatred of Gays, Lesbians.\"6-4 We may piously say that we don't hate the sinner, only the sin, but the newspaper believed it just the way it was printed, and gays and lesbians do, too.\n \n \n \n A writer says, \"Those of us who have published opinion pieces in favor of gay equality can testify that most of the hate mail we get cites religious justifications for the hate.\"6-5\n \n \n \n A gay and a straight man worked together and became close friends. Then the straight man became a Christian. When his friend learned about it, he was concerned and asked, \"Now that you are a Christian, will you still love me?\" Isn't that a tragic question? What did this man think about Christians that made him ask that? The Christian has a love that transcends anything known by the world, doesn't he/she? Yet how many Christians would desert such a friendship? Christians! Jesus' love included; our lack of love excludes. I have read that Carl Sandburg was once asked what he thought was the ugliest word in the English language. He thought for a minute and replied, \"Exclusion.\"\n \n \n \n Our churches need to change, for the churches ought to be havens for gays and lesbians from the insufferable burdens they bear constantly. But when the world believes that churches despise and condemn homosexuals, those who hate them find encouragement. Fundamentalists such as Southern Baptists and Catholics promote the problems seemingly with a vengeance, declaring homosexuality itself a sin.6-6 Even the mainstream denominations do to a great extent as we read frequently in the papers. Most denominations are discussing it openly; without exception they are divided in their thinking, and the news reports of the discussions publicize the negative rhetoric along with the positive. This subject so needs to be examined and discussed at length in our churches, without passion and with open minds. I believe what I am stating in this letter will be the truth the churches will discover. Then they must act on and proclaim that truth.\n \n \n \n When the story of the Holocaust became more fully known, there was recognition that the sin of the Nazis was not the only sin involved--there was the silence on the part of the churches and of other nations as they learned about it during the war. When we know of the hate and the hate-crimes against lesbians and gays, we should not be silent; we have a responsibility to fight it. Our silence encourages it and makes us guilty.\n \n \n \n Pastor Paul Duke is preaching about the sufferings of gays and lesbians:\n \n Whose fault is this? It's the fault of us all. It's the fault of any of us who make jokes about gay people, who insult them with the use of demeaning names. It's the fault of us who are silent when others do these things or when they publish lies about what homosexuality is. And it's the fault of us who don't provide a safe place and a caring response to those of homosexual orientation. Who knows how many hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost - to violence, to suicide, to drugs, to promiscuity, to AIDS, to shattered self-esteem, to life forever outside the doors of the church - because we have participated in or by silence colluded with the demeaning and the ostracizing of homosexual people. In this respect there is blood on the hands of the church. And that's what has driven me more than anything else to talk with you as I am doing. I have had a vision of Christ at the judgment asking, \"Why were you silent?\" Why has the church abandoned these children of God to despair and to death? When people are lost and dying by the millions you don't pontificate about sexual morality, you reach out to them, you give them a safe place, you listen, you talk, you love with the love of Christ.6-7\n \n \n \n You and I realize that the people in our churches are ignorant about the truths I have already stated about homosexuals and homosexuality. They must be made to realize that honesty and integrity demand they make judgments on the basis of knowledge and not on groundless feelings and prejudice. It's like the race hatreds and segregated churches of a few decades ago; most church people know better now and our churches are at least open to all. The same must happen with this issue. I think of the homespun philosopher Josh Billings' saying, \"The longer I live the more I find it necessary to reexamine those things about which I was once most certain.\" The church can't begin its reexamination too soon.\n \n \n \n I've given a lot of space to the church here, but that's where we both have our hearts. And our churches are so terribly wrong here, just as they were in the sixties with the race issue and 150 years ago with slavery. All the wonderful things our churches are doing and the immeasurable importance they are to our society can't cover up our woeful failures in this matter.",

I'd prefer a couple of phrases that summarize the article by you personally...\n \n 2 Ladywolf: Don't believe joebrummer about people faring what they don't understand. Negativity does not necessarily result from fear. For example, if I am afraid of thunderstorm, I wouldn't throw fists at it, I'd try to hide from it. See, I am not like against gays, no one in particular, I am against the concept. I don't ignore or walk around gays, no, but I am against the concept of homosexuality, because I believe and have reasons to believe that men are made for women and vice versa.\n \n As far as I understand, negativity is the reaction to the phenomenon. Reaction not caused by fear but by knowing that gays besides corrupting themselves and doing disgusting things between each other (I don't call it making love, sorry, just can't call it love), they corrupt the society and propagade their lifestyle. If they lived a quiet life and didn't show off on TV and gay parades, I would not be that negative.",

Approval...I'm sorry, but you won't get mine...and probably many more in society.\n\n \n \n \n Where to start? First of all. I apllaud your post for being very civil in what your are saying, but there are a few misconceptions in your post I will try to clear up for you.\n \n Gays and lesbians do not have a lifestyle. We have lives to which by no choice of our own, we live day to day just like everybody else. The majority of gays and lesbians are not at the pride parade or the clubs. We are too busy doing the day to day stuff. You know, cutting the lawn, making dinner, working and trying to find some quaility time to spend with our partners.\n \n You asked if we seek the approval of society? The answer is \"No\". I really don't care about the approval, I do care about tolerance from others to live my life with my partner of five years as a couple. Don't care what others think about \"us\". My friends and family agree, he is the best thing that ever happen to me. His family says the same of me. The catch is that due to the current laws in America, we do not get to share in the same priviledges as other couples. If by some chance one of us should pass away we will be taxed out the ying yang. Although we own our house together as \"Joint Owners\" That only protects the ownership. We will still have to pay huge inheritance taxes (excuse my spelling) that married couples would not have to pay. That is unfair. He makes more money than me, I would not be able to keep the house and pay the taxes at the same time. Even his life insurance policy would be taxed at 20%, after the cost of a funeral, and all the taxes there would not be enough to refinace the house and let me keep it.\n \n The Bible doesn't metion homosexuality anywhere in it. I would ask that you go to www.godmademegay.com and read what the baptist minister from Va. has written with an open mind. You will open your eyes to some very common sense things to gays and the bible. It explains in some detail with very good references from bible scholars all of the \"Currently\" used verses people believe are about gays that are really not.\n \n \n No one is looking for approval, we are looking to live our lives free from oppression. Most people (not all) who learn more about homosexuality and talk with those who are homosexual openly about it, learn to defend it with us. They learn that it is not a choice. I myself tried so hard to be \"straight\". It was horrible. I did not want to be one of \"those people\". After many attempts at killing myself, I finally decide to figure out how to be happy. So I came out, told my parents. They knew all along they admitted. It was like the world came off my shoulders. I told my friends, they too, said the knew all along. I started getting happy, felling good about me. Why? Because I was finally being honest.\n \n \n \n Does it make anymore sense now?",

Ok, now would somebody perhaps enlighten me as to why it is that when conservatives such as Bill Bennett, Dr Laura and Vice President Dan Quayle were raising the issue of family values and alarming us about the dangers of pre-marital sex, cohabitation, illegitimacy, infidelity and divorce, they were greeted with scorn and contempt, accused of being judgmental, puritanical and hypocritical, and essentially told to mind their own business? Could someone maybe explain the critical reception that liberals greeted the publishing of works such as \"The Divorce Culture\" by Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, \"The Abolition of Marriage\" by Maggie Gallagher and \"A Return to Modesty\" by Wendy Shalit? We have seen the family values advocates treated as if they were dangerous kooks for daring to lecture people about the need to treat marriage as a lifetime commitment as opposed to a union of convenience. And now those who oppose gay marriage are lectured by liberals to say what has been roundly condemned when said in the past. I must say that I don't appreciate it when I am treated as if I have amnesia. I do not posses a bad memory, I am not stupid and I was not born yesterday. If same sex couples want marriage licenses, I will not stand in their way. But I don't appreciate the arrogance, disingenuousness and condescension of the liberals when debating the subject.",

Let me ask you this, Where did you learn that homosexuality is abnormal, unnatural? You learned it from right wing xtian groups or their supporters. Sorta like Nazi's. The right wing has 100's of websites regarding homosexuality and the family. A large portion of these sites \"BLAME\" homsexuals for all sorts of things, AIDS, STD's, drug abuse. The are threaten marriage, the military etc....Some right wing extremist have even blames gays and lesbians for hurricanes, fires (the station fire in RI), deaths. \n \n \"...people died here because god is angry that there are homsexuals in Rhode Island\"\n \n These are very similar claims to that of which the nazi's made in germany about the Jews. That is the point being made. I realize it is not easy to see it, but really the similarities are there, and they are scary. \n \n A very good friend of mine was raised by two lesbians, she is more socially and morially stable than most of the young people I have met that had a mother and father. Having love in your life (a support system) is all children need to grow up and be successful. Life is all about support systems. If you have good support systems as a child, as an adult, as a homeless person with homeless friends, you have a good chance a being successful or at best...you make the best of the situation you have. That cannot be done without the love and support of some kind of support system.\n \n \n Whether it be same sex parents or one parent or both parents or \"The SYSTEM\" for some. As long as a child has a loving support system........I have already said the rest",

   "Greetings to Joe and All:\n \n I was reading your post and came to this part:\n \n Joe wrote << The Bible doesn't mention homosexuality anywhere in it. I would ask that you go to www.godmademegay.com and read what the baptist minister from Va. has written with an open mind. You will open your eyes to some very common sense things to gays and the bible. It explains in some detail with very good references from bible scholars all of the \"Currently\" used verses people believe are about gays that are really not.\n \n Terral's reply << The Bible certainly does mention homosexuality, and this behavior as the 'due penalty of their error.\" Romans 1:27. Please allow me to remind everyone that the Roman Empire extended its rule over most of the world known to the Apostle Paul. His letters were circulated by members of the \"whole praetorian guard\" (Philippians 1:13). Therefore, the book of Romans represents his best attempt at spreading the truth of God to the whole world. He also wastes no time in addressing the problems associated with the deviant behavior associated with homosexuals, as he meets the subject head on in the very first chapter. Paul writes, \n \n \"For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse. For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures. Therefore GOD GAVE THEM OVER in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them. For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.\" Romans 1:20-25.\n \n Terral << The above demonstrates that homosexuality is the result of a darkened heart, as the reward (or compensation) for exchanging the glory of God for something else. Has anyone considered that a heterosexual person has never defiled the belief system or values of the natural children from a single homosexual couple? Can the same be said of the children of the normal heterosexual people? The focus of the heterosexual couple is upon their offspring, and the next generation of our society, while the focus of the homosexual deviants is upon themselves and their own sexuality. Paul continues,\n \n \"FOR THIS REASON God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing INDECENT ACTS and receiving in their own persons the DUE PENTALTY OF THEIR ERROR. And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a DEPRAVED MIND, to do those things which ARE NOT PROPER, being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; {they are} gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful; and although THEY KNOW THE ORDINANCE OF GOD, that those who practice such things are WORTHY OF DEATH, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.\" Romans 1:26-32.\n \n Terral << If you wish to bask in the freedoms of true married couples of society, then find yourself a good woman and marry her. What shall your posterity contribute to this great nation? Answer: Absolutely nothing; because you and your lover-boy are incapable of making that kind of contribution to society. You talk about inheriting the common property of your same sex lover. Who will inherit the same when both of you are gone? Whose children? \n \n You know why there will never be a heterosexual parade going down Main Street? Because, it is private. Sexuality belongs in the bedroom, and beyond the prying eyes of our children. It is not something to be flaunted before the whole world like a trophy. This 'In Your Face' attitude of homosexual's is a sick example of the deviant behavior of depraved minds. And this is the heart of the matter that pertains to \"Why So Much Negativity Towards Gays.\" \n \n The practice of homosexuality is immoral and \"indecent\" (Romans 1:27) and \"not proper\" (Rom. 1:28) according to Holy Scripture. Revelation says, \"But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and IMMORAL PERSONS and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part {will be} in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.\" Rev. 21:8.\n \n But, not to worry . . . \"Joe << The Bible doesn't metion homosexuality anywhere in it.\"\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

Their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural, 27 and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men...\n \n \n \n The King James and New International versions say virtually the same thing.\n \n \n \n Romans 1:26 and 27 clearly speak of same-gender sex by both men and women, the only passage in the New Testament that does so. Rom. 1:18-32 speaks of Gentiles (heterosexuals) who could and should have known and served and given thanks to God but would not, so God gave them up and let them do whatever they wanted to do, and that resulted in degrading and shameful acts, including same-gender sex. It is almost a moot point, but Paul is not listing sins for which God will condemn anyone, he is listing sins that occur because people have forsaken Him. These are acts committed by those who have turned away from God and so become \"consumed with passion.\" All of us recognize that those who forsake God and give themselves over to lustful living--homosexual or heterosexual--stand condemned by the Bible. This passage is talking about people who chose to forsake God.\n \n Conservative theologian Richard Hays says, \"No direct appeal to Romans 1 as a source of rules about sexual conduct is possible.\"B-6",

   "Thanks, Joe.\n \n As for Romans 1:26, I'm glad the Bible teacher emphasized in caps that it was GOD who GAVE THEM OVER. They did not have their own free will if they could be given over to these desires and actions by God. The next time guilty gay Christians who literally interpret the Bible have gay intimacy, they can perhaps feel somewhat less guilty and blame God for their own desires and actions. Maybe God was just using them, sexually. \n \n If someone can convince me that one can be given over to desires and actions by someone else, and that first person also always had his or her own free will, I will admit to being wrong. \n \n In the verse, the Greek words physin was translated to mean natural, and paraphysin was translated as unnatural. The word paraphysin is used to mean that actions are not in keeping with an individual's personal character or personal nature. An example of this word paraphysin being used is in Romans 11:24. In that verse God acts in a paraphysin way, which is out of character for him personally, and accepts the Gentiles. \n \n Perhaps what is wrong is that they went against their own personal identity, casually throwing it aside, as their identity was \"straight\". They were trying to be something they were not. I don't see how this verse is talking about people with a \"gay\" identity, or character, or personal nature.",

   "Here is some more interesting background about the environment the Romans 1:26 verse was describing. It hardly applies to gay or lesbian sex and coupling today...\n \n In Romans 1, Paul is ridiculing pagan religious rebellion, saying that the pagans knew God but worshipped idols instead of God. To build his case -- which he'll turn against judgmental Jews in chapter 2 -- he refers to typical practices of the fertility cults involving sex among priestesses and between men and eunuch prostitutes such as served Aphrodite at Corinth, from where he was writing this letter to the Romans. Their self-castration rites resulted in a bodily \"penalty.\" Catherine Kroeger comments in the Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society that 'Men wore veils and long hair as signs of their dedication to the god, while women used the unveiling and shorn hair to indicate their devotion. Men masqueraded as women, and in a rare vase painting from Corinth a woman is dressed in satyr pants equipped with the male organ. Thus she dances before Dionysos, a deity who had been raised as a girl and was himself called male-female and 'sham man.\"' Kroeger continues: \"the sex exchange that characterized the cults of such great goddesses as Cybele [Aphrodite, Ishtar, etc.] the Syrian goddess, and Artemis of Ephesus was more grisly. Males voluntarily castrated themselves and assumed women's garments. A relief from Rome shows a high priest of Cybele. The castrated priest wears veil, necklaces, earrings and feminine dress. He is considered to have exchanged his sexual identity and to have become a she-priest.\" As such, these religious prostitutes would engage in same-sex orgies in the pagan temples all along the coasts of Paul's missionary journeys. 'Paul's conception of homosexuality,\" as Thielicke points out, \"was one which was affected by the intellectual atmosphere surrounding the struggle with Greek paganism.\" Says Scroggs: \"The illustrations are secondary to [Paul's] basic theological structure\" (Cf. 3:22b-23, Paul's own summary), and Furnish adds: \"homosexual practice as such is not the topic under discussion.\" Doesn't what Paul says in the beginning of Romans better describe these pagan orgies he meant to ridicule than it does the mutual love and support in the domestic life of lesbian and gay male couples today?\n http://www.ecinc.org/Scriptures/romans126.htm",
