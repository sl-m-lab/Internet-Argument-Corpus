   "19th Century Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story explained-\n \"The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of the republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpations and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them. And yet, though this truth would seem so clear, and the importance of a well regulated militia would seem so undeniable, it cannot be disguised, that among the American people there is a growing indifference to any system of militia discipline, and a strong disposition, from a sense of it burdens, to be rid of all regulations.  How it is practicable to keep the people duly armed without some organization, it is difficult to see. There is certainly no small danger, that indifference may lead to disgust, and disgust to contempt; and thus gradually undermine all the protection intended by the clause of our national bill of rights.\"\n \n Joseph Story says that the desire \"to be rid of all regulations\" is a significant threat to the Right to Bear Arms. And we all know who opposes regulations.\n \n \"As long as there have been guns in America there have been regulations governing their use and storage. Without government direction there would have been no body of Minutemen to muster on the town greens at Lexington and Concord. If the Founders had imbibed the strong gun rights ideology that drives today's gun debate we would all be drinking tea and singing, 'God save our gracious Queen.' Ironically, the Second Amendment does not prohibit robust gun regulation, it compels it.\" \n www.hnn.us/articles/24828.html\n \n That's because that in order to create an effective fighting force you need regulation. How effective would the US Army be as a fighting force if there were no regulations and every soldier did his own thing? Hamilton, in Federalist 29, recognized the importance of \"uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia\" and said that \"This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority.\"\n http://www.foundingfathers.info/federalistpapers/fed29.htm",

Interpreting the right as the gun lobby now does- being able to own and carry guns for your own private purposes- would make no sense in that context because the Quakers were not opposed to using guns for private purposes such as hunting. Chief Justice Joseph Story said it was difficult to see how the people could be armed \"without some organization\". And it is obvious from the previous sentence that such organization is the well regulated militia. Thus Story had a hard conceiving how the people could be armed outside the context of a well regulated militia.",

   "Well I think Cornell misses the point of preambles. Cornell appears to me to have started his research by first drawing a conclusion and then going off to wade through the available material in a search for things which might support his conclusion. It is a little like showing up at a very crowded cocktail party, and as soon as you come through the door standing up on your toes to look over the heads of all the guests there in search for your friends. \n \n By looking over the crowd for his friends, I believe he ignores the fact that preambles were widely used in all of the constitutions of the time, and that in every case they were intended to introduce the right referenced by first stating a universally held truth or belief. There is not a single instance I can find where a preamble was designed to limit the right which follows it, and it is only where the RKBA is concerned that anyone, like Cornell, for example, even attempts to use the preamble as a noose to restrict the right. \n \n There are many examples of the use of preambles Cornell ignores which I could cite, all of which pre-date the drafting of the 2nd. Amendment. Here is one from the Constitution of Massachusetts:\n \n \"The liberty of the press is essential to the security of freedom in a state: it ought not, therefore, to be restrained in this Commonwealth.\" \n \n Here is another example, which comes from the constitution of my beloved Commonwealth of Virginia:\n \n \"That religion, or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence; and therefore all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience; and that it is the mutual duty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other.\" \n \n In each of these we see that the right is introduced by first stating a universally held belief, and these preambles cannot be construed as somehow limiting the right they introduce.\n \n I would challenge Cornell to find a single instance where a preamble can be shown as intended to modify or constrict the substantive right.\n \n Cornell obviously would say the Second Amendment's preamble is one, but again I think he misses the point of that preamble. This is what he said of the preamble [in the article cited, which is in response to then AG Ashcroft's 2001 letter setting forth an individual RKBA interpretation of the 2nd. Amendment]:\n \n \"The Department of Justice has thus erased the preamble, which states the purpose of the amendment, to create a 'well regulated Militia.'\"\n http://www.h-net.org/~hns/articles/2005/012305a.html. \n \n If we assume Cornell is right, then the natural question is did the founders enshrine this purpose in the Constitution and then forget about it? Where is this militia the amendment was supposed to create? The answer is it does not exist, because that was not the purpose of the amendment. The militia system pre-existed the amendment, and was not modified in any way by the adoption of the amendment.\n \n But another and more damning question Cornell fails to address is why the preamble states \"of a free state\"? He cannot answer this question, because if he is right-if the preamble is not merely stating a universal truth, but was instead designed to limit the RKBA to the creation of a militia-then the inclusion of the words \"free state\" becomes an exercise in writing mere wasteful surplussage.\n \n Here again is the Second Amendment preamble:\n \n \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\"\n \n In my opinion, this was not intended to create a militia which the founders then later decided to ignore in favor of a standing army. Rather, its intended effect was to enshrine within the Constitution the following truth: \n \n \"It has been asserted by the most respectable writers upon government, that a well-regulated militia, composed of the yeomanry of the country, have ever been considered as the bulwark of a free people. Tyrants have never placed any confidence on a militia composed of freemen.\" John DeWitt, The Anti-Federalist Papers, p. 75 (M. Borden ed. 1965)\n \n This is why the preamble reads \"free\" state-that is, a state where citizens do not live in fear of a tyrant using a standing army to oppress them. And If you look, you will see where Madison got his inspiration for including this truth, because it had been expressed in some form or other within a preamble in every state constitution of the time. Here are some examples:\n \n CONSTITUTION OF VIRGINIA (June 6, 1776)\n \n \"That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free state; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty; and that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\"\n \n CONSTITUTION OF NEW HAMPSHIRE (June 2, 1784)\n \n \"A well-regulated militia is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a state.\n \n Standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up without the consent of the legislature.\"\n \n CONSTITUTION OF MARYLAND (November 3, 1776) \n \n \"That a well-regulated militia is the proper and natural defense of a free government.\n \n That standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up, without consent of the legislature.\"\n \n DELAWARE DECLARATION OF RIGHTS (September 11, 1776) \n \n \"That a well-regulated militia is the proper, natural and safe defense of a free government.\n \n That standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up without the consent of the legislature.\"\n \n This, in my opinion, is where Madison found and copied his second amendment preamble belief. Therefore, I read the language \"[a] well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State\" as never being intended by our founding fathers to limit the right of the people to keep and bear private arms. Rather, it is a simple preamble which states the universally held principle that \"standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty.\"\n \n And (with Madison's blessing) this was exactly how the amendment was sold to the public for ratification:\n \n \"As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear private arms.\" Tench Coxe, Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution. Published under the pseudonym, \"A Pennsylvanian\" in the Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789 at 2 Col. 1.\n \n Why, then was it included within the Second Amendment along with the RKBA? First, because it was an important enough statement to be included within the Constitution. Second, it naturally fits in this amendment because the individual RKBA which follows it was and is the counterweight to a government which abandons the truth expressed in the preamble-a government which relies too heavily upon a standing army only to have a tyrant seize control of it to use as a tool of oppression:\n \n \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power, and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination, to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive.\" Noah Webster, \"An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution\" (1787) in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).\n \n Therefore, I submit this is a far more logical interpretation of the militia preamble than Cornell's strained interpretation, and I believe it better tracks the following advice given by Thomas Jefferson:\n \n \"On every question of construction let us carry ourselves back to the time when the Constitution was adopted, recollect the spirit manifested in the debates, and instead of trying what meaning can be squeezed out of the text, or invented against it, conform to the probable one which was passed.\" Thomas Jefferson, The Complete Jefferson, p. 322 (1957) [Letter to William Johnson, June 12, 1823].",

   "I've read different explanations about the relationship between the justification and operative clauses of the Second Amendment. I think Michael Dorf really hits the nail on the head when he states-\n \"The real disagreement between Volokh, on the one hand, and Williams and myself, on the other hand, has nothing to do with the general function of clause preambles; instead, we disagree over whether the operative clause standing alone is ambiguous. In my view, protecting a 'right of the people to keep and bear Arms' is a sufficiently odd way of protecting an individual right to possess firearms for rebellion, self-defense, or hunting as to provoke further inquiry.\n \n \"As I note in the next Part, at the time of the founding, the phrase 'bear arms' was most commonly used in a military setting,[58] and even today it carries a military connotation. This is not to say that people do not use the phrase to refer to individual firearm possession they do. However, many of the people who use the term that way do so for a distinctly political purpose: they aim to associate the language of the Second Amendment with private firearms possession for rebellion, self-defense, or hunting. For example, the home page of the NRA touts all that the organization does for 'your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.'[59] The political import of this use of the Second Amendment's language is difficult to miss. By repeatedly associating the Second Amendment's language with its own political aims, the organization increases the likelihood that, over time, the language will simply come to be synonymous with those aims.\"\n http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/DorfChicago.htm\n \n And for that reason the preamble may not have to act as a limit since bearing arms is already a military activity.",

   "I want to add my two cents on Lewis v. U.S. since it has been addressed in this thread. Although Lewis briefly addressed the 2nd Amendment in a footnote, it was not a 2nd Amendment case. It was a 5th/14th Amendment due process/equal protection case. Lewis had been convicted in Florida of a felony in 1961. At that trial, he was denied his right to counsel, and was therefore convicted in a trial that happened without the benefit of a lawyer to represent him. Two years after his conviction, SCOTUS decided the case of Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963), in which it held that state felony convictions like Lewis' violate the 6th. Amendment. When Lewis was later caught with a gun in Virginia and prosecuted federally as a felon in possession, the government used his old 1961 conviction to prove his disabled status as a felon. On appeal to SCOTUS, Lewis attempted to collaterally attack his old felony conviction. He claimed that using the un-counseled felony conviction against him violated his 5th/14th Amendment due process/equal protection right. SCOTUS deals with all claims involving equal protection/due process by using the \"rational relation\" test to see if the statute was unconstitutional, and you will see that test used here. Here is the full text of part IV of the Lewis opinion, in which SCOTUS makes a passing reference to the 2nd Amendment in footnote 8: \n \n LEWIS v. U.S., 445 U.S. 55, 65-68 (1980) \n \n \"The firearm regulatory scheme at issue here is consonant with the concept of equal protection embodied in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment if there is \"some 'rational basis' for the statutory distinctions made . . . or . . . they 'have some relevance to the purpose for which the classification is made.'\" Marshall v. United States, 414 U.S. 417, 422 (1974), quoting from McGinnis v. Royster, 410 U.S. 263, 270 (1973), and Baxstrom v. Herold, 383 U.S. 107, 111 (1966). See Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 97 (1979). [FOOTNOTE 8, SEE BELOW] [Page 66]\n \n Section 1202 (a)(1) clearly meets that test. Congress, as its expressed purpose in enacting Title VII reveals, 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1201, was concerned that the receipt and possession of a firearm by a felon constitutes a threat, among other things, to the continued and effective operation of the Government of the United States. The legislative history of the gun control laws discloses Congress' worry about the easy availability of firearms, especially to those persons who pose a threat to community peace. And Congress focused on the nexus between violent crime and the possession of a firearm by any person with a criminal record. 114 Cong. Rec. 13220 (1968) (remarks of Sen. Tydings); id., at 16298 (remarks of Rep. Pollock). Congress could rationally conclude that any felony conviction, even an allegedly invalid one, is a sufficient basis on which to prohibit the possession of a firearm. See, e.g., United States v. Ransom, 515 F.2d 885, 891-892 (CA5 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 944 (1976). This Court has recognized repeatedly that a legislature constitutionally may prohibit a convicted felon from engaging in activities far more fundamental than the possession of a firearm. See Richardson v. Ramirez, 418 U.S. 24 (1974) (disenfranchisement); De Veau v. Braisted, 363 U.S. 144 (1960) (proscription against holding office in a waterfront labor organization); Hawker v. New York, 170 U.S. 189 (1898) (prohibition against the practice of medicine).\n \n We recognize, of course, that under the Sixth Amendment an uncounseled felony conviction cannot be used for certain purposes. See Burgett, Tucker, and Loper, all supra. The Court, however, has never suggested that an uncounseled conviction [Page 67] is invalid for all purposes. See Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367 (1979); Loper v. Beto, 405 U.S., at 482. n. 11 (plurality opinion).\n \n Use of an uncounseled felony conviction as the basis for imposing a civil firearms disability, enforceable by a criminal sanction, is not inconsistent with Burgett, Tucker, and Loper. In each of those cases, this Court found that the subsequent conviction of sentence violated the Sixth Amendment because it depended upon the reliability of a past uncounseled conviction. The federal gun laws, however, focus not on reliability, but on the mere fact of conviction, or even indictment, in order to keep firearms away from potentially dangerous persons. Congress' judgment that a convicted felon. even one whose conviction was allegedly uncounseled, is among the class of persons who should be disabled from dealing in or possessing firearms because of potential dangerousness is rational.9 Enforcement of that essentially civil disability through a criminal sanction does not \"support guilt or enhance punishment.\" see Burgett, 389 U.S., at 115, on the basis of a conviction that is unreliable when one considers Congress' broad purpose. Moreover, unlike the situation in Burgett, the sanction imposed by \u00a7 1202 (a)(1) attaches immediately upon the defendant's first conviction.\n \n Again, it is important to note that a convicted felon may challenge the validity of a prior conviction. or otherwise remove his disability, before obtaining a firearm. We simply hold today that the firearms prosecution does not open the predicate conviction to a new form of collateral attack. See Note, Prior Convictions and the Gun Control Act of 1968. [Page 68] 76 Colum. L. Rev. 326, 338-339 (1976). Cf. Walker v. City of Birmingham, 388 U.S. 307 (1967).\"\n \n [FOOTNOTE 8] \"These legislative restrictions on the use of firearms are neither based upon constitutionally suspect criteria, nor do they trench upon any constitutionally protected liberties. See United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 178 (1939) (the Second Amendment guarantees no right to keep and bear a firearm that does not have \"some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia\"); United States v. Three Winchester 30-30 Caliber Lever Action Carbines, 504 F.2d 1288, 1290, n. 5 (CA7 1974); United States v. Johnson, 497 F.2d 548 (CA4 1974); Cody v. United States, 460 F.2d 34 (CA8), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1010 (1972) (the latter three cases holding, respectively, that \u00a7 1202 (a)(1), \u00a7 922 (g), and \u00a7 922 (a)(6) do not violate the Second Amendment).\"\n \n The interesting thing about this case is SCOTUS assumed Lewis had standing to raise a 2nd. Amendment claim. Before you can ever challenge a statute on the grounds that it violates a constitutional right, you must first show that you had standing to claim protection from the right-that is, you must first show that you are a person or entity whom the right applies to. For example, if the 2nd. Amendment RKBA was a right only of the states to arm their militias, then only a state could come before SCOTUS and complain that it was denied the right. \n \n Now George Calvin Lewis, Jr. is obviously not a state. He never claimed to be a member of any state militia, and he never claimed that the firearm he possessed was kept for any purpose other than an individual one. If SCOTUS was prepared to adopt the collective right view of the 2nd. Amendment, then it would have dismissed Lewis' claim to 2nd Amendment protection out of hand for lack of standing. It would have said that since the right does not apply to individual citizens he could not complain that he was being denied the right. In short, you can't claim to be protected by a right you never had to begin with.\n \n For 2nd. Amendment analysis purposes, what SCOTUS did in Lewis was assume that an individual citizen who possesses a firearm for an individual purpose can claim the protection of a 2nd Amendment individual RKBA-and then it ruled that a ban on felons possessing firearms is a restriction which does not unconstitutionally infringe upon that individual right. I think it is easy to justify how a felon in possession ban can be reconciled with an individual RKBA, but SCOTUS' limited treatment of the subject does not explain its justification for this. Instead of giving the subject the treatment it deserved, SCOTUS merely regurgitated the flawed analysis in Miller (which was NOT a felon in possession case) without explaining how the holding in Miller applies to the facts in this case.\n \n ---\n \n \"The issue, however, is not whether court rules are \"mutable\"; they assuredly are. It is not whether, in the light of \"various circumstances,\" they can be \"modifi[ed]\"; they assuredly can. The issue is whether, as mutated and modified, they must make sense. The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.\" Dickerson v. U.S., 530 U.S. 428, 455 (2000) [J. Scalia and Thomas, dissenting opinion]",

   "Well, to look at it from another angle, the phrase \"the right of the people\" is used in more than one amendment.\n \n The 1st. Amendment says: \"Congress shall make no law...abridging...the right of the people peaceably to assemble.\"\n \n The 2nd. Amendment reads: \"The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\"\n \n The 4th Amendment reads: \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated....\"\n \n The collective/state right interpretation of RKBA would agree the phrase \"the right of the people\" recognizes and protects an individual right in the 1st Amendment, but would transform that language into a right of the states in the 2nd Amendment, only to reconvert the language into recognizing an individual right in the 4th Amendment. \n \n I have friends who believe in the collective right interpretation, and when I press them with this analysis they shrug and say the militia preamble acts as the magical agent of this Orwellian transformation. Yet none of them can explain why or how the militia preamble warps this phrase, other than they just want it to be that way. I have never heard any collective right view supporter logically explain why the same wording must be read to say very different things. In fact, my friends just pretend to ignore the analysis, which only encourages me to irritate them further by repeating it. \n \n Is there anyone out there who can explain why I should accept the collective right double-think translation of the phrase \"the right of the people\"?",

Can the unorganized militia really claim to be well regulated? I don't think so. One Federal Appeals Court explained, \n \n \"Since the Miller decision, no federal court has found any individual's possession of a military weapon to be 'reasonably related to a well regulated militia.' 'Technical' membership in a state militia (e.g., membership in an 'unorganized' state militia) or membership in a non-governmental military organization is not sufficient to satisfy the 'reasonable relationship' test. Oakes, 564 F.2d at 387. Membership in a hypothetical or 'sedentary' militia is likewise insufficient.\"\n -US v. Hale\n \n So they state that membership in an unorganized militia is not enough to satisfy the reasonable relationship test that was established by the Supreme Court. I also think that looking at history of the unorganized militia is illuminating:\n \n \"A. The term 'unorganized' did not begin to emerge until the 1830s and 1840s, when a massive wave of opposition destroyed the compulsory militia system. Nobody wanted to serve in the militia. State governors and legislators wanted to be able to accommodate this desire, but they were bound by the 1792 Uniform Militia Act, which stated that every white male aged 18-45 would be in the militia. \n However, the 1792 Uniform Militia Act explicitly allowed the states to determine who was exempt from militia service. So states divided their militias into two sections, the 'organized' militia and the 'unorganized' militia. In this way, the letter, though not the spirit, of the 1792 law could be complied with. However, only the 'organized' militia would have responsibilities. These people would be volunteers, people who actually wanted to perform militia service; they gradually evolved into the National Guard. These people would have uniforms, guns, and would drill, review and encamp. \n \n The other people were the people who did NOT want to be in the militia. Accordingly, members of the 'unorganized' militia were NOT supposed to perform any duty or carry any weapons or have any responsibilities. All that would remain was the nominal authority of the state over them for military manpower purposes. This group of people had no militia responsibilities at all (in some areas they had to register, like for the draft today). In this way states could flaunt the spirit of the 1792 Uniform Militia Act, while nominally keeping to the letter of it.\"\n http://www.adl.org/mwd/faq3.asp\n \n So basically the unorganized militia was created to accommodate the people who didn't want to be in the militia.",

   "19th Century Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story explained-\n \"The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of the republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpations and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them. And yet, though this truth would seem so clear, and the importance of a well regulated militia would seem so undeniable, it cannot be disguised, that among the American people there is a growing indifference to any system of militia discipline, and a strong disposition, from a sense of it burdens, to be rid of all regulations.  How it is practicable to keep the people duly armed without some organization, it is difficult to see. There is certainly no small danger, that indifference may lead to disgust, and disgust to contempt; and thus gradually undermine all the protection intended by the clause of our national bill of rights.\"\n \n Joseph Story says that the desire \"to be rid of all regulations\" is a significant threat to the Right to Bear Arms. And we all know who opposes regulations.\n \n \"As long as there have been guns in America there have been regulations governing their use and storage. Without government direction there would have been no body of Minutemen to muster on the town greens at Lexington and Concord. If the Founders had imbibed the strong gun rights ideology that drives today's gun debate we would all be drinking tea and singing, 'God save our gracious Queen.' Ironically, the Second Amendment does not prohibit robust gun regulation, it compels it.\" \n www.hnn.us/articles/24828.html\n \n That's because that in order to create an effective fighting force you need regulation. How effective would the US Army be as a fighting force if there were no regulations and every soldier did his own thing? Hamilton, in Federalist 29, recognized the importance of \"uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia\" and said that \"This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority.\"\n http://www.foundingfathers.info/federalistpapers/fed29.htm\n\n \n \n The word \"regulated\" in the second amendment refers to trained and made regular -meaning uniform. But it sure as hell can not plausibly mean \"disarmed\" -as in the government has the power to regulate, therefor they can ban the possession of arms by law abiding individuals.\n \n If you want to argue that the government has the power to demand that we purchase at our own expense mitlitary weapons and always keep them at the ready, and that we render military service in person, then I would agree with you. Story was concerned that the people were indifferent to this sort of regulation, but he was not using \"regulation\" in the sense that the government could prohibit the people from owning weapons. \n \n \n \n \n Story's Commentaries (continued from where you left off):\n \n \u00a71891. A similar provision in favour of protestants (for to them it is \n confined) is to be found in the [English] bill of rights ofll of rights of \n 1688, it being declared, \"that the subjects, which are protestants, may have \n arms for their defence suitable to their condition, and as allowed by law.\" \n [FN3] But under various pretences the effect of this provision has been \n greatly narrowed; and it is at present in England more nominal than real, as \n a defensive privilege.\" \n \n Footnotes: \n 1 Tucker's Black. Comm. App.300; Rawle on Const. ch.10, p.125; 2 Lloyd's Debates, 219,220.\n It would be well for Americans to reflect upon the passage in Tacitus, \n (Hist.IV ch.74): \"Nam neque quies sine armis, neque arma sine stipendis, \n neque stipendia tributis, haberi queunt.\" Is there any escape from a large \n standing army, but in a well disciplined militia?

   "I've read different explanations about the relationship between the justification and operative clauses of the Second Amendment. I think Michael Dorf really hits the nail on the head when he states-\n \"The real disagreement between Volokh, on the one hand, and Williams and myself, on the other hand, has nothing to do with the general function of clause preambles; instead, we disagree over whether the operative clause standing alone is ambiguous. In my view, protecting a 'right of the people to keep and bear Arms' is a sufficiently odd way of protecting an individual right to possess firearms for rebellion, self-defense, or hunting as to provoke further inquiry.\n \n \"As I note in the next Part, at the time of the founding, the phrase 'bear arms' was most commonly used in a military setting,[58] and even today it carries a military connotation. This is not to say that people do not use the phrase to refer to individual firearm possession they do. However, many of the people who use the term that way do so for a distinctly political purpose: they aim to associate the language of the Second Amendment with private firearms possession for rebellion, self-defense, or hunting. For example, the home page of the NRA touts all that the organization does for 'your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.'[59] The political import of this use of the Second Amendment's language is difficult to miss. By repeatedly associating the Second Amendment's language with its own political aims, the organization increases the likelihood that, over time, the language will simply come to be synonymous with those aims.\"\n http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/DorfChicago.htm\n \n And for that reason the preamble may not have to act as a limit since bearing arms is already a military activity.\n\n \n There is actually an opinion by a current SCOTUS justice on what the term \"bear\" means in relation to the 2nd. Amendment. It is, to my knowledge, the only time anyone from SCOTUS has addressed the meaning of the word \"bear\" in the context of the amendment. It comes in a dissent written by Justice Ginsberg, which was joined by Rhenquist, Scalia, and Souter. The issue in the case was determining what \"carries\" meant in a federal statute which enhanced the punishment for drug offenders who \"carry\" firearms. The gun in this case was \"carried\" in a car. The dissent looked at the word \"carries\" and then on its own turned to the word \"bear\" in the 2nd. Amendment:\n \n \"Unlike the Court, I do not think dictionaries,2 surveys of press reports,3 or the Bible4 tell us, dispositively, what \"carries\" [Page 143] means embedded in \u00a7 924(c)(1). On definitions, \"carry\" in legal formulations could mean, inter alia, transport, possess, have in stock, prolong (carry over), be infectious, or wear or bear on one's person.5 At issue here is not \"carries\" at large but \"carries a firearm.\" The Court's computer search of newspapers is revealing in this light. Carrying guns in a car showed up as the meaning \"perhaps more than one-third\" of the time. Ante, at 129. One is left to wonder what meaning showed up some two-thirds of the time. Surely a most familiar meaning is, as the Constitution's Second Amendment (\"keep and bear Arms\") (emphasis added) and Black's Law Dictionary, at 214, indicate: \"wear, bear, or carry . . . upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose . . . of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person.\"\"\n \n Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125, 142-143 (1998) (Ginsberg, dissenting) [bold emphasis added by me]",

   "I do not want to get hung up on the militia angle. When I posted the federal militia code section earlier in this thread I was not suggesting that the RKBA should be tied to any militia duty or participation. I still believe that the militia clause of the 2nd. Amendment is a preamble which does not affect the right clause which follows it. \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=182362#post182362\n \n SCOTUS has never tied the RKBA to membership or participation in a militia. In all of its cases since Miller, not one single person has claimed to be a member of a militia, and yet the Court heard the infringement claim anyway. If SCOTUS were to believe that the right only pertains to militia members, then all of these 2nd. Amendment right claims would have been dismissed out of hand for lack of standing. SCOTUS would have told these appellants that since the right does not apply to individual citizens you cannot complain that you have been denied the right. In short, you can't claim to be protected by a right you never had to begin with. And to my knowledge, U.S. v. Emmerson was the only cases in which the government sought to overreach and claim that only militia members have a RKBA. The government's argument was rejected by the 5th. Circuit, and shortly thereafter the Bush Administration permitted Ashcroft to reverse that policy argument.\n \n U.S. v. Miller was no different in refusing to tie the RKBA to militia service. Jack Miller was a bootlegger who got caught with a sawed off shotgun. He never claimed that he was a member of a militia, or that he was performing a militia function when he got caught. But SCOTUS did not dismiss his 2nd. Amendment infringement claim for lack of standing as a militia member. Instead, it assumed that he had an individual right to keep and bear a firearm for his individual purposes. After accepting the individual right existed, SCOTUS then announced the right was limited to weapons which can be shown to have a legitimate militia function. In doing so, it punished Miller in a very ex post facto manner. At Miller's trial he did not put forth any facts to suggest that his sawed-off shotgun could contribute to the common defense. He had no reason to do so, because although he had a very sympathetic judge who was looking for a way to use the 2nd. Amendment he could not look into the future to see that SCOTUS would declare this to be the standard on appeal. Now typically when SCOTUS announces new standards it will remand the case back to the trial court for a new \"do over\" hearing in which everyone now knows what must be proved. (Atkins v. Virginia is an excellent example of how this works). But in Miller SCOTUS essentially said \"sorry buddy, you didn't prove the standard and it's your fault for not having guessed what it would be on appeal.\"\n \n Having said all this, though, U.S. v. Miller is still an individual right opinion. It literally stands for the position that as an individual citizen who is not enrolled in any militia, I have a 2nd. Amendment right to keep and bear any weapon which is \"part of the ordinary military equipment.\" Under Miller, I have a legitimate claim to a right to keep and bear any weapon currently used by our armed forces. Additionally, if my weapon is not one that is \"part of the ordinary military equipment\" then I still have an individual right to keep and bear it if I can prove that its use \"could contribute to the common defense.\" That is the flawed logic of Miller in a nutshell, and every SCOTUS case which has cited it since has merely regurgitated the final holding in the case without bothering to explain why it applies to the case currently before it.",

   "Yeah, my post was concerning the current court. And you are right about Miller. The Court recognized that Miller had a right to \"bear\" arms for individual purposes. \n \n We can go back further than Miller even to find examples of SCOTUS using a non-military/militia interpretation of the 2nd. Amendment phrase \"keep and bear arms.\" In 1875 SCOTUS heard U.S. v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, which dealt with the federal prosecution of a klansmen for conspiracy to violate a new federal law which made it a crime to deprive a citizen of his fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Cruikshank was specifically charged with conspiring to deny the black freedmen their fundamental rights of free speech and to keep and bear arms. He did so by leading a band of rioters who burned down a Louisiana courthouse in which armed freedmen had taken refuge while protesting a disputed election. \n \n Like Miller, this was a case involving non-military possession of firearms by private individuals for purposes of private self defense without any connection to a militia function. When klansman Cruikshank sought to deprive the black freedmen of this right, he was prosecuted. This is how SCOTUS described the 2nd. Amendment RKBA: \n \n \"The right there specified is that of bearing arms for a lawful purpose.\" Cruikshank, 92 U.S. at 552. [my bold emphasis]\n \n Again we see a description of the right to keep and bear arms which is not limited to a military context. In this case, the bearing of arms was for the lawful purpose of individual self-defense. \n \n Now this case is often cited by gun control proponents who have seized upon a quote taken out of context in the Court's analysis of the 2nd. Amendment: \"The right there specified is that of bearing arms for a lawful purpose. This is not a right granted by the Constitution.\" Id. [my bold emphasis] Now I have heard gun control proponents cite this quote and argue that this means the constitution does not recognize a RKBA. But that is not what the Court said. \n \n Here is the full quote:\n \n \"The right there specified is that of bearing arms for a lawful purpose. This is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed; but this, as has been seen, means no more than it shall not be infringed by Congress. This is one of the amendments that has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government.\" Id. \n \n What SCOTUS said here is that Bill of Rights did not create rights, it merely recognized certain pre-existing fundamental rights. And this has been a consistent theme in SCOTUS precedent: \"The law is perfectly well settled that the first ten Amendments to the Constitution, commonly known as the Bill of Rights, were not intended to lay down any novel principles of government, but simply to embody certain guarantees and immunities which we had inherited from our English ancestors.\" Robertson v. Baldwin, 165 U.S. 275, 281-82 (1897). \n \n So SCOTUS recognized that the black freedmen had a 2nd. Amendment protected right to \"keep and bear arms for a lawful purpose\"--like self-defense. SCOTUS also found that these men had a 1st. Amendment protected right to free speech. SCOTUS did not dispute the evidence which showed that Cruikshank, by burning down the courthouse, conspired to deprive these black citizens their free exercise of these rights. Yet SCOUTS reversed Cruikshank's conviction because it held that the Bill of Rights only acted as a limitation on the powers and activities of the federal government, and not those of private citizens or the individual states. \n \n This is an important distinction to remember. SCOTUS has always held that the Bill of Rights acts only to restrict the powers of the federal government. Decades later SCOTUS began using the 14th. Amendment to \"incorporate\" several rights in the Bill of Rights to make the states recognize and protect them, like the right of free speech, right to remain silent, right to representation by a competent lawyer, freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, etc. All of these were incorporated gradually and individually through a process called \"selective incorporation\" as cases dealing with these rights came before SCOTUS. But no case has ever come before SCOTUS requiring it to decide whether to incorporate the 2nd. Amendment as a limitation on the power of the states to restrict the RKBA. Unless and until SCOTUS does so, the states are free to thumb their nose at the 2nd. Amendment, and the only restriction on a state's power to infringe on the RKBA comes, if at all, from a recognition of an individual RKBA in its own state constitution. \n \n ---\n \n The issue, however, is not whether court rules are \"mutable\"; they assuredly are. It is not whether, in the light of \"various circumstances,\" they can be \"modifi[ed]\"; they assuredly can. The issue is whether, as mutated and modified, they must make sense. The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.

It's in his book but I quote this blog for convenience:\n \"The Klan's disarmament of the Negro militias became the trigger for a militia-based theory of 2nd Amendment incorporation. The Democrats opposed this theory and refined their states' rights theory in response to this version of incorporation. I was somewhat astonished that nobody in the South Carolina KKK trials raised anything like the individual rights theory of the 2nd Amendment. Indeed, the right of self defense was cited by the Klan as an argument against the militia view! The final nail in that theory was Cruikshank. In that case the individual rights theory was floated by one of the judges who first heard the case, but it was abandoned by the government and rejected by the Supreme Court when the case was finally heard. Rather than adopt a neo-abolitionist point of view and embrace the individual rights view, the Court embraced the views of the Democrats who opposed incorporation and viewed the Second Amendment as a right of the states.\"\n http://blog.oup.com/oupblog/2006/07/tushnet_cornell.html",

   "That was an interesting quote from Cornell on Cruikshank. I have read Cruikshank. I think Cornell is dead wrong in his analysis of this case, and I think he misunderstands how the Court has implemented the policy of incorporation through the 14th. Amendment. Cornell is right when he suggests that an individual right theory was discussed, because that point was conceded and no one disputed that the black men who suffered under Cruikshank's actions had an individual RKBA. Cruikshank dealt with the question of whether the 2nd. Amendment RKBA could be extended to protection against infringement by an individual citizen's actions. This case did not concern itself with the nature of the civil right (whether individual or collective). Rather, it dealt with the issue of who could be prohibited from acting to violate it. SCOTUS ruled consistently with case precedent that the Bill of Rights acts only to prohibit actions by the federal government. \n \n Now Cruikshank was not, and could not be, a case of incorporation. Cruikshank involved the federal government charging an individual citizen with violating a federal statute which made it a crime to violate the civil liberties of another citizen. The doctrine of incorporation was never an issue in this case because that doctrine is triggered only in cases involving a complaint that the state has acted to deny an individual federal civil liberty which the state should now be to forced to recognize and protect. \n \n Here is an analogy which I hope helps explain my point that incorporation would have been a moot issue in this case. Look at the issue of incorporation as though the federal government were you parents and the state of Louisiana in this case is your big brother. Your parents set out a Bill of Rights for you and they promise to respect those rights. Your big brother then decides to violate one of your rights, and when you complain, your parents smack him for it. When he complains about getting popped, your parents say \"hey, that's the doctrine of incorporation-now you're also going to follow my rules son and respect your little brother's rights.\" Now in Cruikshank, it's your fellow citizen, let's say your racist white brother-in-law, who chooses to violate your rights, and your parents rule on this case by saying \"well sorry, the individual right does still exist, but we didn't set these rules up to make him follow them.\" But if your parents were to have thought out loud, as Cornell seems to suggest, about using the doctrine of incorporation in this case your big brother would whine and say \"what did I do?\" This would have been the argument of the State of Louisiana if incorporation had been an issue in Cruikshank-\"but what did I do?\"-because Louisiana did nothing in this case to trigger consideration of the doctrine of incorporation.\n \n I would like to see Cornell's evidence which suggests the doctrine of incorporation was raised and rejected by SCOTUS in a case in which it could not have come into play. If this evidence exists, then it would be historically significant as the only SCOTUS case to do so, and this while at a time of near drought in SCOTUS incorporation decisions. In fact, SCOTUS almost entirely ignored the doctrine of incorporation during that time period. \n \n The only pre-1900 SCOTUS case using the doctrine of incorporation involved arose in 1897, when SCOTUS chose to use the doctrine to incorporate against the states the protection of the 5th. Amendment right to compensation for property taken by the State; Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U.S. 226 (1897). But with the exception of this case, SCOTUS let the doctrine of incorporation languish and did nothing more with it for 30 years until 1927, when it chose to finally require the states to recognize the 1st. amendment rights of speech, press, and religion. Fiske v. Kansas, 274 U.S. 380 (1927), The doctrine was again abandoned for another 20 years, when it resurfaced in a case in which SCOTUS decided to require the states to recognize the 6th. Amendment protected right to a public trial In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257 (1948). It was then abandoned again until the 1960s, when SCOTUS suddenly became far more active and adopted a deliberate process of \"selective incorporation\" (4th. Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and to have excluded from criminal trials any evidence illegally seized; Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961); the 6th. Amendment right to counsel, Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963); the right guaranteed by the 5th. Amendment to be free of compelled self-incrimination; Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1 (1964); and to the 6th. Amendment rights to a speedy trial Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U.S. 213 (1967), confrontation of opposing witnesses, Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400 (1965), compulsory process for obtaining witnesses, Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14 (1967), and trial by jury. Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 162 (1968)).\n \n The Common thread in every case here is that they all involve a complaint that the state has acted to deny an individual liberty protected in the Bill of Rights. Cruikshank did not, and I am at a loss to understand how Cornell finds a rejection of the incorporation doctrine in this case. \n \n I'm, sorry; I just cannot accept Cornell's analysis of Cruikshank.",

   "I have two thoughts on Cornell's analysis of how SCOTUS dealt with standing in Miller. 1. I think Cornell misses the importance of the issue of standing. 2. I also think his assumption-that SCOTUS could have dismissed Miller's 2nd. Amendment claim for lack of standing but chose not to do so-is wrong because it suggests that SCOTUS acted not only illegally but illogically.\n \n 1. Whether we think judges engage in so-called \"judicial activism\" or not, one key restraint on the power of the federal judiciary has always been the Article III Section 2 requirement that federal courts avoid overstepping their authority by accepting and deciding cases that do not present a \"case or controversy.\" This principle which sets the scope of judicial authority is fundamental that SCOTUS never ignores it. The following cases illustrate how important this point is:\n \n Under Article III, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution, the federal courts have jurisdiction over this dispute between appellants and appellees only if it is a \"case\" or \"controversy.\" This is a \"bedrock requirement.\" Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 471 (1982). As we said in Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26, 37 (1976): \"No principle is more fundamental to the judiciary's proper role in our system of government than the constitutional limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies. One element of the case-or-controversy requirement is that appellees, based on their complaint, must establish that they have standing to sue. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 818 (1997)\n \n Standing is the \"irreducible constitutional minimum\" necessary to make a justiciable \"case\" or \"controversy\" under Article III, \u00a7 2. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560. Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 84 (1998)\n \n Now without this limitation on the federal judiciary, there is nothing to prevent SCOTUS from interjecting itself into any public policy debate it wants to at any time. This unbridled power has always been rejected by SCOTUS, and to avoid treading into such dangerous ground standing is something that the Court always looks to. In many cases (and I assert Miller is one of them) standing is so clear and unquestioned that no side raises it as an issue and it never gets mentioned. In these cases the law permits us to assume standing exists. In any case where standing is even remotely questionable, however, SCOTUS always deals with that issue on the record in its opinion, and only after it agrees that standing exists will it then rule on the questions presented in the case. The best example I can give you of this process was Roe v. Wade, where the Court struggled with the idea of finding standing for the female plaintiff who at the time the case came before SCOTUS was no longer pregnant. Now SCOTUS clearly wanted to reach and rule on the issue of abortion, but it could not ignore the standing issue to do so. Therefore, SCOTUS dealt with the standing question by declaring that this is a unique case where standing existed because the plaintiff was pregnant when the case was filed, and because of the temporary nature of pregnancy if that standing were to be required when the case reached SCOTUS you could never get a case there fast enough to get it heard: \n \n Pregnancy often comes more than once to the same woman, and in the general population, if man is to survive, it will always be with us. Pregnancy provides a classic justification for a conclusion of nonmootness. It truly could be \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 125 (1973). \n \n The constitutional point I think Cornell misses is standing is such a fundamental concept that no matter how badly SCOTUS wants to get its hands on an issue, no matter how necessary it feels the need to be to rule on the merits of a case issue, it never ignores or runs roughshod over the question of standing to reach the substance of the case.\n \n 2. As I understand Cornell, he argues that SCOTUS could have dismissed Miller's 2nd. Amendment claim for lack of standing but did not do so because \"the Supreme Court wanted to make it clear that Congress' regulation of such guns was Constitutional.\" This first assumes that the Miller Court deliberately chose to violate the Article III Constitutional requirement of standing, and it assumes that SCOTUS did so for an illogical reason. \n \n Miller's claim of a 2nd. Amendment violation was the allegation that his protected individual RKBA was violated by Congress' act banning sawed-off shotguns. If Cornell's assumption is correct-that SCOTUS wanted to approve and protect the power of Congress to regulate these weapons-then the most effectual way to achieve this goal would have been to declare that no individual right exists, and therefore neither Miller nor any other individual citizen has standing to challenge congressional power to ban these weapons. This would be a far greater and more absolute guarantee of that approved congressional power than what SCOTUS actually did-assume that not only could an individual citizen challenge this authority, but if he could also prove that the weapon had some legitimate militia function then he could exempt the weapon from the reach of that authority. \n \n So then if I understand Cornell's argument clearly, he suggests that SCOTUS had a goal of supporting congressional power to regulate certain firearms; that SCOTUS had two options available to do this; and that it deliberately chose the path of violating the Constitution so it could render a decision which actually grants less protection to the congressional power it so wanted to support. I just can't accept the logic of such an argument.",

   "I think the NRA would have to go a lot farther than that if it was truly interested in promoting the Second Amendment. Thomas Scott explained his reason for objecting to the consientious objector clause in the debate about the proposed Second Amendment in the First Congress. He feared that under the proposed clause conscientous objectors would, \"neither be called upon for their services, nor [could] an equivalent be demanded.\"\n \n He said that in such circumstances, \"a militia can never be\n depended upon. This would lead to the violation of another article in the constitution, which secures to the people the right of keeping arms, and in this case recourse must be had to a standing army.\"\n \n Scott further explained his objection futher,\n \"There are many sects I know, who are religiously scrupulous in this respect; I do not mean to deprive them of any indulgence the law affords; my design is to guard against those who are of no religion. It has been urged that religion is on the decline; if so, the argument is more strong in my favor, for when the time comes that religion should be discarded, the generality of persons shall have recourse to these pretexts to get excused from bearing arms\"\n \n He thought non religious people would use the clause to exempt themselves from keeping and bearing arms rather than those who had a legitimate reason.\n \n Scott's fear was people would find a way around the Second Amendment by declaring themselves conscientous objectors. Now people have found another way around the Second Amendment and that is the unorganized militia. People can now claim to belong to the unorganized militia although they may never engage in any type of militia activity. If groups like the NRA were truly interesting in following the Second Amendment they would be advocating the return of such laws as the Militia Act of 1792.\n\n \n \n The NRA does support the ownership of militiary style weapons by the general populace, and does encourage marksmanship and proper handling.\n \n Do they support forcing persons like professor Cornell to pay into a fund for delinquents from which poor persons could be provided arms ? I have never heard such a thing proposed by the NRA but I can't say for certain either way.\n \n \n But considering there are many tens of millions of people willing and able to provide themselves with arms at their own expense, I would say that the militia is much better armed than at any time in the past, and the lack of a fund for delinquents in not a problem that needs addressing.\n \n I am not an NRA member (yet) so I can not say for certain whether they would support state mandated training if it went far beyond basic marksmanship and weapons familiarity. For instance if the states suddenly rekindled an interest in the militia now that the federal government has overworked the National Guard, and set about requiring men between 16 and 60 to report for training for a month at a time, I really couldn't guess what the NRA's response would be. \n \n To my knowledge, the NRA has not proposed any such thing so as in most cases, Cornell's argument does have a small sliver of truth to it. But as usual, he ignores the larger issue -the NRA does support CIVILIAN arms ownership and marksmanship which is the baseline training that is needed for CIVILIAN readiness (i.e. militia). And if Cornell had his way, there would be no civilian readiness whatever.",

What if the main military force of our day adopted the NRA's attitude?- We will encourage soldiers to own guns. We will encourage them to train. But it isn't necessary to require it. Many soldiers may have little experience or no experience with guns. Many may have no training at all. But that's okay. They'll be ready when the time comes. How practical do you think such an attitude is? The General Social Survey indicates the gun ownership rate has been declining in America. Down to about a third now. And how many own machine guns and are trained to use them? Now I think we can recognize the truth in Cornell's statement about modern day pro-gun ideology:\n \"If the Founders had imbibed the strong gun rights ideology that drives today's gun debate we would all be drinking tea and singing, 'God save our gracious Queen.' Ironically, the Second Amendment does not prohibit robust gun regulation, it compels it.\" \n www.hnn.us/articles/24828.html\n \n I think the founders wanted the militia to be a well trained and effective fighting force so that they wouldn't have to rely so much on a standing army.

   "Cornell's analysis of Cruikshank has really been bothering me. Cornell said that in U.S. v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542 (1875) SCOTUS rejected the incorporation doctrine. I have already addressed how this was impossible since this was not a case of state action.\n \n But now, having re-read Cruikshank, I have lost all respect for Cornell's argument. First, here is the web page where anyone can read the entire Cruikshank opinion. \n \n http://www.usscplus.com/online/index.asp?case=0920542\n \n I post this link because I don't want anyone to have to just take my word for what I am about to say of Cornell's analysis of Cruikshank. \n \n This is the relevant portion of what Cornell said about this case: \n \n \"The final nail in that theory was Cruikshank. In that case the individual rights theory was floated by one of the judges who first heard the case, but it was abandoned by the government and rejected by the Supreme Court when the case was finally heard. Rather than adopt a neo-abolitionist point of view and embrace the individual rights view, the Court embraced the views of the Democrats who opposed incorporation and viewed the Second Amendment as a right of the states.\" http://blog.oup.com/oupblog/2006/07/tushnet_cornell.html (bold emphasis added by me)\n \n Now read the actual case opinion, because I tell you Cornell's analysis is an absolute fabrication of the holding. SCOTUS never said what Cornell wants it to say. SCOTUS never even implied it, and there are only three possible alternatives for how Cornell so poorly misapprehends this case: Either 1. He never read the case and is merely relying on someone else's flawed analysis. OR 2. He read the case but did not understand it, and just decided to assume it says what he wants it to say OR 3. He read the case and chose to deliberately misconstrue what SCOTUS said.\n \n I remember when Michael Bellesiles cited 1800's probate records from San Francisco, which he claimed he looked through and cataloged in his anti-individual right research. I remember his shame when fellow academics questioned how he got his hands on records that had been obliterated by the 1908 quake, and his further shame when he frantically tried to say he must have done the research in a library in a neighboring county, only to have the library say \"nope, we don't have the records either, and we further have no record that Bellesiles ever did his research here.\" \n \n I also remember the shame of pro-gun individual right supporter John Lott, when it was discovered he all but dressed in drag by spoof posting internet praise of his own research under the fictional name \"Mary Rosh.\" He lost credibility with me then, and I no longer cite him.\n \n And now I see Cornell (whether intentionally or not I can't say) misleading people about a case in which he fraudulently claims SCOTUS rejected the individual RKBA. And this comes on top of his illogical assumption of SCOTUS' intention in U.S. v. Miller that I have already addressed. I don't know where to rank this and compare it to Bellesiles or Lott, but Cornell has lost all credibility with me. \n \n I invite anyone to not take my word for it. Read the actual case and decide for yourself if he misrepresents what SCOTUS said.",

But the Second Amendment actually invites government interference. People that refused to arm themselves and show up for militia muster could be court martialled.\n\n \n \n But how on earth do you get from those comments to a place where the right to bear arms is much less than the duty. I argue that the right must be at least as broad as the duty -nothing you posted above would contradict that, and in fact the statement from Blackstone would support my point.\n \n Given that militia duty (to constantly keep a supply of arms and render military service in person) was a duty of all free men capable of bearing arms, would not the right be at least as broad? \n \n Instead of contradicting my arguments you are supplying information that supports them.\n \n Now if only you could find evidence that the right to keep and bear arms is actually much more constrained than the duty, you would have something to run with.",

   "Waving around a vague notion of a \"military context\" does not answer the question of \"who\" possessed to right in question.\n \n The one definite answer from a review of the usage of \"bear arms\" is that the term refers to the actions of individuals.\n\n Did I ever say it referred to the states? Cornell challenges us to think outside of the collective/individual dichotomy. \n \n \n\n Which individuals? -would be the next logical question. Since the amendment does not qualify \"the people\" in any way (no \"when in actual service\" or any such qualifier) then it must refer to the people as in the other amendments in which the phrase \"the right of the people\" is used.\n \n \n For what purpose can the people keep and bear arms?\n The amendment does not specify that the right to keep and bear arms is to be protected ONLY for service in a militia. There is no conditional attached to \"the right ... shall not be infringed\".\n\n But if the term itself has a military meaning then attaching another phrase that expressed such a conditional would be redundant. \n \n \n\n What you are left to argue is that the words \"bearing arms\" limits the protections for the possession and use of arms to ONLY those persons on active duty in a state sponsored militia and ONLY for state militia purposes. \n \n But you do not have anything to make your case other than a vague \"military constext\". I have already mentioned 3 contemporary references to uses of arms by individuals which are not exclusively related to state militia purposes but which are mentioned in a militia act, in a proposal for an amendment guaranteeing the right of the people to bear arms, and in describing the proper role of the militia while defending the authority of the federal government over the militia. Note that each of these references are highly relevant in both time and subject matter to the discussion at hand. \n \n But can you mention even one contemporary reference in which the second amendment or \"the right to keep and bear arms\" was said to refer ONLY to persons on active duty in the state militia?\n\n I'm familiar with one of those references (the minority report). Cornell basically argues that its use of bear arms is non standard that it was put together at the last moment and not well thought out. Ulliver and Merkel point out that the minority consisted of only one man:\n \"Yet this 'minority report' turns out, on closer inspection, to reflect no more\n than the ramblings of a single embittered eccentric who departed the\n convention in disgust when he was unable to scuttle ratification. As\n such, the failure of Pennsylvania's one man 'minority' merely\n accentuates the fact that opinion favoring a personal right to arms\n independent of the militia remained highly marginal in state\n conventions outside of New Hampshire.\"\n http://lawreview.kentlaw.edu/articles/76-1/Final%20Uviller-Merkel.pdf\n \n And finding a few references in which bear arms has an alternative meaning doesn't change the big picture. Keep and bear arms not only means active duty it also means being prepared for active duty. \n \n \n\n One can hardly imagine a bill of rights to a state constitution containing a right to bear arms provision which referred exclusively to persons enrolled in the armed forces of the state as that would be a pointless guarantee. And yet you claim that is the meaning of the phrase in the context of the second amendment.\n\n Why would it be pointless? Don't you think it important for the militia to be prepared?",

   "Not at all. If the intent was to limit the use of arms by individuals to only active duty persons, then the term \"the people\" requires a qualifier. You keep ignoring the \"who\".\n\n \"bear arms\" would seem to be the qualifier. People usually bear arms in connection with a military organization. I don't think the Founders intended for a bunch of one man militias to be walking around. You had to enroll in the militia. \n \n \n \n Note that in Aymette, the court said that bearing arms had only a military meaning, BUT that court said the state could NOT deny the citizens' right to bear arms altogether -only to place limits for maintaining the peace. As to keeping arms, that court said as long as the ARMS were suitable for use for militia duty, the right of the citizens to keep them is \"unqualified\".\n\n Interesting. So do people have a right to keep any military weapon in their homes? Historian Gary Wills explains that keep does not necessarily mean keep at home. It could mean the people keep their guns in some type of communal armory \"Gun advocates read 'to keep and bear' disjunctively, and think the verbs refer to entirely separate activities. 'Keep,' for them, means 'possess personally at home'- a lot to load into one word. To support this entirely fanciful construction, they have to neglect the vast literature on militias.....Some arms could be kept at home, course. Some officers kept their most valuable piece of war equipment, a good cross-country horse, at home, where its upkeep was a daily matter feeding and physical regimen. But military guns were not ideally kept home.\"\n http://www.potowmack.org/garwills.html \n If it does mean keep at home what would that mean in our day? You can keep any type of weapon no matter how dangerous, even WMD's in your own home? The city of Boston in the 18th Century passed a law which limited the amount of gun powder that could be kept in a person's home. \"Unqualified\" as used by the Amyette Court probably means there were no qualifications such as existed in the British right to bear arms (social status and religion).\n \n \n \n Cornell tries to dismiss the Address of the PA Minority as a non-standard usage (hunting as a meaning to bearing arms) but the clear intent of that provision was to protect the right to bear arms as an individual right in relation to the common defense as well as for individual purposes.\n\n That may have been the true intent but that does not necessarily mean its use of language was standard. \n \n \n\n The failure to get passage of the proposal for a right to bear arms amendment no more reflects a lack of support for that meaning than the failure of the Minority to a get passage of a free press or freedom of religion provisions reflects a lack of support for those rights. Once again Cornell employs specious reasoning.\n\n We know that there was support for freedom of the press and freedom of religion because it was actually included in the Bill of Rights. What was never included was an amendment protecting hunting. \n \n \n \n\n John Adams mention of \"personal self defense\" in Defense of the Constitution\n is even more harmful to Cornell's argument in that Adams was not even discussing rights, Adams was discussing the militia in general and individual citizens being armed, and for what purposes he considered acceptable.\n\n John Adams may have favored arms for personal self defense but did he say that this is what is meant by the right to bear arms? \n \n \n\n In the VA militia act they are specifying the types of arms that are required to be puchased and kept -and they make an allowance for the milita west of the blue ridge to keep rifles instead of the standard musket.

I would much rather have a few contemporary usages supporting my argument, than none supporting a claim that the right relates only to active duty militia service.\n\n \"Supporters of the individual rights view have focused on the fact that Coxe asserted that 'the people are confirmed by the next article in their right to keep and bear their private arms.' While at first glance this would seem to provide proof of an individual right, it is not clear in what capacity the people's private arms are protected. Are they protected as private citizens or are they protected because as militiamen citizens were expected to provide their own weapons for militia duty? Coxe's statement ultimately tells us little about how people understood the individual or collective nature of the right to keep and bear arms in the late-eighteenth century.\"\n http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5200\n \n So the Coxe quote doesn't necessarily tell us for what purpose it was protected. \n \n \n\n Lastly, few is better than none! I would much rather have a few contemporary usages supporting my argument, than none supporting a claim that the right relates only to active duty militia service.\n\n In Madison's first draft of the Second Amendment bear arms clearly has a military meaning. In the debates in the first Congress it also had a military meaning. \n \n From a PhD dissertation that examined the early usage of the term:\n \"This paper finds that the overwhelming preponderance of usage of 300 examples of the 'bear arms' expression in public discourse in early America was in an unambiguous, explicitly military context in a figurative (and euphemistic) sense to stand for military service, especially in the militia.\"\n http://www.potowmack.org/emerappa.html#summ\n So I don't think the claim can be easily dismissed. Just because one come up with a few quotes where it might have had a non military meaning doesn't change the big picture. \n \n \n\n Yes! \"It also means being prepared for active duty\". \n That has been my point all along. All of us have that right, whether we are on active duty or not. If I had known you agreed with me on that point we could have moved on earlier.\n\n I'm not sure what your point is. Are you arguing that those not in the militia had to be prepared for militia duties? If that's so then why not include them in the militia? Minutemen were expected to be ready at a minute's notice. That's an example of being prepared.",

   "Let me come back to the discussion if I can. Cornell is correct when he urges us to think outside the state's \"right\" v. individual right views. There is a third rail in the track of this debate which a hybrid \"collective\" individual right view. It holds that the right is collectively held amongst members of the state-sponsored militias to use their militia arms when called for service by the states. You can reach this argument if you construe \"the people\" to mean people only in a collective context.\n \n There are a couple of problems with this view. Like the states \"right\" view, it suffers from the inability to explain why the right is included in several early state constitutions. You could make an argument for a state's or collective individual right in the U.S. Constitution because the amendment was intended to restrict the power of the federal government and thus could be intended to preserve either the power of the state to control the arming of its militia or the right of individuals to collectively carry state-sponsored weapons in service to the state. But if this was the goal, then there is no justification for the right being present in the state constitutions. It cannot be a state's \"right,\" because the state did not need to have the right included in its own constitution to protect it from itself. Likewise, it cannot be a collective right because it would be meaningless-the state again controls the right. If it does not want you to exercise the right, then it merely has to ignore the militia, refuse to enroll anyone in it, and raise a standing army-which would have run counter to the stated fears our founders had of standing armies.\n \n The second problem is this: How do we remain consistent with our interpretation of other rights in the Bill of Rights? Do we interpret the 2nd. Amendment in a vacuum? Do we use one standard for interpreting the other 9 amendments, but reserve an entirely different one for the RKBA? The phrase \"the right of the people\" is used in the 1st. Amendment. Is \"the right of the people\" to free speech individual or collective? Can I engage in it on my own like I am doing now, or must I only exercise it in some collective fashion like a mass protest for my speech to be protected? The same phrase \"the right of the people\" also begins the 4th. Amendment. Is the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure individual or collective? As an individual driving home from work, do I have a 4th. Amendment protected right not to have my car stopped and searched without probable cause, or is the right collective and therefore applying only to public mass transportation like a bus or the D.C. metro? Do I have an individual 4th. Amendment right to be free from having my home searched without probable cause and a warrant, or is the right collective and only protecting mass meeting houses like churches or sporting arenas? \n \n The answer to all of these questions is the phrase \"the right of the people\" means an individual right every time it is used. We can't take the exact same phrase and say \"people\" means an individual person in the 1st. Amendment, then a collective mass of persons in the 2nd. Amendment, only to morph the word back to meaning an individual person in the 4th. Amendment.",

   "The People is rather a vague and general term and I think the founders could have viewed those belonging to the militia as being the people. .\n\n \n The people meaning the same as the militia only makes sense if the militia is a general militia which includes all of \"the people\". A thing can not be a something less than itself. \"The people\" can not plausibly refer to only a small portion of the people. \n \n \n \n\n Modern day gun advocates like to assign a very individualistic meaning to \"the people\" and interpret it as meaning each adult individual. The 55 delegates who referred to themselves as \"We the People\" in the premable to the Constitution probably thought their actions were generally representative of the people. It didn't mean that each individual in America wanted a Constitution. .\n\n \n So are you now making a collective rights argument? Is that what you have been doing all along? \n \n \n \n \n \n\n Yes, I think so. I think the situation with conscientious objectors is illuminating. Some of the Founders thought that exempting certain people from bearing arms would be a threat to the right. Now if the right were a personal right for such things as hunting and self defense this would make little sense. A conscientious objector could still do these things although he was not required to perform any militia duties. .\n\n \n How's that?\n \n Mr. Gerry - This declaration of rights, I take it, is intended to secure the \n people against the mal-administration of the government; if we could suppose that in all cases the rights of the people would be attended to, the occasion for guards of this kind would be removed. Now, I am apprehensive, sir, that this clause would give an opportunity to the people in power to destroy the constitution itself. They can declare who are those religiously scrupulous, and prevent them from bearing arms. What, sir, is the use of a militia? It is to prevent the establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty. Now it must be evident, that under this provision, together with their other powers, congress could take such measures ith respect to a militia, as make a standing army necessary. Whenever government mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order to raise an army upon their ruins. \n \n Gerry objects to the CO clause because it might be used by govenment as pretext to prevent some portion of the people from bearing arms. How can that help your argument?\n \n Or would that be Scott's complaint that if the government did not compel COs to pay into the fund for delinquents, then there would be no money to purchase arms for those who were to poor to buy them themselves?\n \n Both objections are on the basis that the goverment might undermine the militia by preventing the people from keeping or bearing arms, and then place complete reliance on the standing army. If Cornell really respected the second amendment and understood its history he would not be arguing that since the militia has fallen into disuse, the right no longer exists.\n \n \n \n \n\n The existence of a well regulated militia would lessen the reliance on a standing army. That's how it was intended to hold the government in check. It wouldn't matter if a few were disabled and unable to perform militia duty. What would matter is that the militia itself was an effective military force. .\n\n \n If the government could undermine the existence of an effective milita by disarming the people using various pretexts, we would have exactly the situation decried by Mr. Gerry, Mr. Scott, and Joseph Story.\n \n \"If a few were disabled\" is a bad joke considering that in your view the government can \"disable\" anyone they so choose. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n I think the Second Amendment would be neutral on such an issue. \n Game laws would be discriminatory against the poor and middle and lower classes and therefore perhaps a violation of the 14th's equal protection clause.

   " \"bear arms\" would seem to be the qualifier. People usually bear arms in connection with a military organization. I don't think the Founders intended for a bunch of one man militias to be walking around. You had to enroll in the militia. .\n\n \n So now your argument is that \"bear arms\" is a qualifier? You can not be serious. Consult a book on grammar. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n Interesting. So do people have a right to keep any military weapon in their homes? Historian Gary Wills explains that keep does not necessarily mean keep at home. It could mean the people keep their guns in some type of communal armory \"Gun advocates read 'to keep and bear' disjunctively, and think the verbs refer to entirely separate activities. 'Keep,' for them, means 'possess personally at home'- a lot to load into one word. To support this entirely fanciful construction, they have to neglect the vast literature on militias.....Some arms could be kept at home, course. Some officers kept their most valuable piece of war equipment, a good cross-country horse, at home, where its upkeep was a daily matter feeding and physical regimen. But military guns were not ideally kept home.\"\n http://www.potowmack.org/garwills.html \n If it does mean keep at home what would that mean in our day? You can keep any type of weapon no matter how dangerous, even WMD's in your own home? The city of Boston in the 18th Century passed a law which limited the amount of gun powder that could be kept in a person's home. \"Unqualified\" as used by the Amyette Court probably means there were no qualifications such as existed in the British right to bear arms (social status and religion)..\n\n \n Gary Wills shows how silly he can be when suggesting that if the founders wanted the people to have the right to Keep arms at home they would have specified that right. \n \n From A Necessary Evil:\n If Congress had meant anything so outlandish, it could have said with great verbal economy \"keep at home and bear ....\" \n \n Paraphrasing the eminent linquist:\n If Coingress wanted us to have the freedom of speech at home, they would have been more specific. \n \n Of course, as any 4th grader knows, the words \"at home\" would act a qualifier placing a limit on the right. As it stands, the freedom of speech is unqualified and so there is absolutely no need to specifiy that we have the right to freedom of speech at home. \n \n On the other hand, if Congress had wanted individuals to keep their arms only in central stores, they would have specified that in the Second Amendment and in the 1792 Militia Act -but they did not!\n \n \n And yes, \"unqualified\" in Aymette refers to there being no further (the right included all free white men) qualifications on WHO may bear arms under the Tenn. constitution which was far broader in that regard than the British bill of rights. There is no mention of having to be on active duty or even enrolled in the militia in order to keep arms, and that is the case even in the Tenn. constitution in which the phrase \"for the common defense\" follows the right to bear arms. \n \n The Second amendment is broader still since it refers to \"the people\" and does not contain the qualifier \"for the common defense\".\n \n \n \n \n\n That may have been the true intent but that does not necessarily mean its use of language was standard. .\n\n \n Neither Cornell, nor anyone else to date, has found any contemporary evidence to support the claim that the right to bear arms ONLY related to persons on active duty. If that were truly the ONLY meaning of the right to bear arms, you would think that your side could find at least ONE reference. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n We know that there was support for freedom of the press and freedom of religion because it was actually included in the Bill of Rights. What was never included was an amendment protecting hunting. .\n\n \n Is there a freedom to publish novels explicitly written into the First Amendment? \n \n \n \n \n\n John Adams may have favored arms for personal self defense but did he say that this is what is meant by the right to bear arms? .\n\n \n \n What he said is much, much worse for your argument. He said that in reference to the mililita, and to the purposes that it would be acceptable for individuals to have arms in their hands. Your incessant attempts to limit the use of arms only to militia purposes is completely undercut, as Adams is on record in a highly influential paper saying that private self defense is a legitamate use of arms. I suppose Adams is also a lone dissenter, eh?\n \n In case you still don't get it, private self defense was used by a highly influential Founder and Framer in a highly influential treatise as a legitimate use of arms in a discussion of the proper role of the militia. Thus making it difficult for one to argue that the only uses of arms protected by the second amendment are those with a connection to the militia, and at the same time try to exclude private self defense.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \"Supporters of the individual rights view have focused on the fact that Coxe asserted that 'the people are confirmed by the next article in their right to keep and bear their private arms.' While at first glance this would seem to provide proof of an individual right, it is not clear in what capacity the people's private arms are protected. Are they protected as private citizens or are they protected because as militiamen citizens were expected to provide their own weapons for militia duty? Coxe's statement ultimately tells us little about how people understood the individual or collective nature of the right to keep and bear arms in the late-eighteenth century.\"\n http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5200\n \n So the Coxe quote doesn't necessarily tell us for what purpose it was protected. .\n \n \n \n It doesn't tell us anything because that quote you cite says so? Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain, eh?\n \n Seems Coxe is another lone dissenter. He uses \"Bear...arms\" in a non-military fashion. He is not using the phrase in the limited way of meaning \"to render militiary service in person\", rather he is using it the broader meaning of carrying arms. Furthermore he says \"private arms\" which means that in his view the right is private, belonging to the person -do you recall the Blackstone quote you cited a few posts ago?\n \n \n \n \n\n In Madison's first draft of the Second Amendment bear arms clearly has a military meaning. In the debates in the first Congress it also had a military meaning. \n \n From a PhD dissertation that examined the early usage of the term:\n \"This paper finds that the overwhelming preponderance of usage of 300 examples of the 'bear arms' expression in public discourse in early America was in an unambiguous, explicitly military context in a figurative (and euphemistic) sense to stand for military service, especially in the militia.\"\n http://www.potowmack.org/emerappa.html#summ\n So I don't think the claim can be easily dismissed. Just because one come up with a few quotes where it might have had a non military meaning doesn't change the big picture. .\n\n \n Except those \"few quotes\" aren't so few, and they relate very closely both in time and topic to the right to keep and bear arms. Also some of those usages were widely published at the time so would undoubtedly have informed a good portion of the public about the meaning of the second amendment. \n \n \n \n \n\n I'm not sure what your point is. Are you arguing that those not in the militia had to be prepared for militia duties? If that's so then why not include them in the militia? Minutemen were expected to be ready at a minute's notice. That's an example of being prepared.\n\n \n What I am getting at is your claim that only those on active duty would have the right/duty to keep and bear arms. But that is not the case. Even those who were not on active duty had to keep a supply of arms.",

   "The people meaning the same as the militia only makes sense if the militia is a general militia which includes all of \"the people\". A thing can not be a something less than itself. \"The people\" can not plausibly refer to only a small portion of the people.\n\n So if you say that the people chose to reelect Bush in 2004 does that mean everyone voted for Bush? Whether it seems plausible to you or not that's how language is used. \n \n \n\n So are you now making a collective rights argument? Is that what you have been doing all along?\n\n Certainly it has both collective and individual elements in it. But the theory advocated by Cornell doesn't not fit into either of the collective versions. \n \n \n\n How's that?\n \n Mr. Gerry - This declaration of rights, I take it, is intended to secure the \n people against the mal-administration of the government; if we could suppose that in all cases the rights of the people would be attended to, the occasion for guards of this kind would be removed. Now, I am apprehensive, sir, that this clause would give an opportunity to the people in power to destroy the constitution itself. They can declare who are those religiously scrupulous, and prevent them from bearing arms. What, sir, is the use of a militia? It is to prevent the establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty. Now it must be evident, that under this provision, together with their other powers, congress could take such measures ith respect to a militia, as make a standing army necessary. Whenever government mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order to raise an army upon their ruins. \n \n Gerry objects to the CO clause because it might be used by govenment as pretext to prevent some portion of the people from bearing arms. How can that help your argument?\n \n Or would that be Scott's complaint that if the government did not compel COs to pay into the fund for delinquents, then there would be no money to purchase arms for those who were to poor to buy them themselves?\n \n Both objections are on the basis that the goverment might undermine the militia by preventing the people from keeping or bearing arms, and then place complete reliance on the standing army. If Cornell really respected the second amendment and understood its history he would not be arguing that since the militia has fallen into disuse, the right no longer exists.\n \n\n I don't see how bear arms has a non military meaning in that quote. And if the bear arms has a non-military meaing how would not requiring certain people to serve in the militia prevent them from bearing arms? In that case they could still bear arms for hunting and self defense so the government wouldn't be preventing them from bearing arms because they were exempted from militia duties because of their conscientious objector status. \n \n \n\n If the government could undermine the existence of an effective milita by disarming the people using various pretexts, we would have exactly the situation decried by Mr. Gerry, Mr. Scott, and Joseph Story.\n \n \"If a few were disabled\" is a bad joke considering that in your view the government can \"disable\" anyone they so choose.\n\n When did I say that?\n \n \n\n That's very odd -you began this thread with a quote from Joseph Story,\n Yet here you are contradicting the man.\n \n \"\u00a7 1891.

   "Let me come back to the discussion if I can. Cornell is correct when he urges us to think outside the state's \"right\" v. individual right views. There is a third rail in the track of this debate which a hybrid \"collective\" individual right view. It holds that the right is collectively held amongst members of the state-sponsored militias to use their militia arms when called for service by the states. You can reach this argument if you construe \"the people\" to mean people only in a collective context.\n \n There are a couple of problems with this view. Like the states \"right\" view, it suffers from the inability to explain why the right is included in several early state constitutions. You could make an argument for a state's or collective individual right in the U.S. Constitution because the amendment was intended to restrict the power of the federal government and thus could be intended to preserve either the power of the state to control the arming of its militia or the right of individuals to collectively carry state-sponsored weapons in service to the state. But if this was the goal, then there is no justification for the right being present in the state constitutions. It cannot be a state's \"right,\" because the state did not need to have the right included in its own constitution to protect it from itself. Likewise, it cannot be a collective right because it would be meaningless-the state again controls the right. If it does not want you to exercise the right, then it merely has to ignore the militia, refuse to enroll anyone in it, and raise a standing army-which would have run counter to the stated fears our founders had of standing armies.\n \n The second problem is this: How do we remain consistent with our interpretation of other rights in the Bill of Rights? Do we interpret the 2nd. Amendment in a vacuum? Do we use one standard for interpreting the other 9 amendments, but reserve an entirely different one for the RKBA? The phrase \"the right of the people\" is used in the 1st. Amendment. Is \"the right of the people\" to free speech individual or collective? Can I engage in it on my own like I am doing now, or must I only exercise it in some collective fashion like a mass protest for my speech to be protected? The same phrase \"the right of the people\" also begins the 4th. Amendment. Is the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure individual or collective? As an individual driving home from work, do I have a 4th. Amendment protected right not to have my car stopped and searched without probable cause, or is the right collective and therefore applying only to public mass transportation like a bus or the D.C. metro? Do I have an individual 4th. Amendment right to be free from having my home searched without probable cause and a warrant, or is the right collective and only protecting mass meeting houses like churches or sporting arenas? \n \n The answer to all of these questions is the phrase \"the right of the people\" means an individual right every time it is used. We can't take the exact same phrase and say \"people\" means an individual person in the 1st. Amendment, then a collective mass of persons in the 2nd. Amendment, only to morph the word back to meaning an individual person in the 4th. Amendment.\n\n I'm not convinced all the other rights in the Bill of Rights are purely individual in nature. Akhil Reed Amar explains:\n \"The amendment speaks of a right of 'the people' collectively rather than a right of 'persons' individually...... libertarians read 'the people' to mean atomized private persons, each hunting in his own private Idaho, rather than the citizenry acting collectively. But, when the Constitution speaks of 'the people' rather than 'persons,' the collective connotation is primary. 'We the People' in the preamble do ordain and establish the Constitution as public citizens meeting together in conventions and acting in concert, not as private individuals pursuing our respective hobbies........The rest of the Bill of Rights confirms this communitarian reading. The core of the First Amendment's assembly clause, which textually abuts the Second Amendment, is the right of 'the people'--in essence, voters--to 'assemble' in constitutional conventions and other political conclaves. So, too, the core rights retained and reserved to 'the people' in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments were rights of the people collectively to govern themselves democratically. The Fourth Amendment is trickier: 'The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.' Here, the collective 'people' wording is paired with more individualistic language of 'persons.'\n http://www.constitution.org/2ll/2ndschol/103wha.htm\n \n And aren't people committing what is known in logic as the fallacy of division when they claim that if the people have the right to bear arms then each person must have the right to bear arms? What is true of the whole is not necessarily true of each part.",

And note that in Aymette it is the citizens who keep and bear arms -not the militia. \n \n Yes, that is right.

   "I don't think it's a fallacy of division. Each person would have the right to keep and bear arms, just like each person would have the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure.\n \n I like reading Amar, but I'm going to have to disagree with his \"communitarian analysis\" of the BoR. He wants to read the phrase \"the people\" in the 2nd. as exclusively collective in context. To reach this conclusion, he unequivocally asserts \"[t]he rest of the Bill of Rights confirms this communitarian reading.\" The admitted stumbling block in his analysis is the 4th. Amendment: \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated....\" \n \n I believe he would have been better off ignoring the 4th. Than engaging in the speculative guesswork he did. He begins with: \n \n \"Here, the collective \"people\" wording is paired with more individualistic language of \"persons.\" And these words obviously focus on the private domain, protecting individuals in their private homes more than in the public square.\"\n \n Now Amar cannot argue that the phrase \"the people\" means a collective right in the 4th. He knows that this phrase was viewed by our founders and by all courts which have ever considered this amendment to be a right of each individual citizen. His mention of the 4th.'s inclusion of the word \"persons\" is meaningless. Indeed, I cannot understand why he felt it important enough to mention it only to studiously avoid any analysis of it. Here is mine: \"The people\" in the amendment refers to individual citizens who have a right to be secure in their (individually possessive) \"persons.\" Here, the use of the word \"persons\" merely confirms that the phrase \"the people\" also refers to individuals. \n \n But Amar still will not let the collective definition go: \"Why, then, did the Fourth use the words \"the people\" at all?\" Here is where I believe Amar overreaches the most: \n \n \"Probably to highlight the role that jurors--acting collectively and representing the electorate--would play in deciding which searches were reasonable and how much to punish government officials who searched or seized improperly.\" \n \n Again, there is no analysis of this argument. He cites no example, no statement, no court precedent or procedure to support this guesswork. This is because none exists. I have been immersed in the 4th. Amendment for over 15 years now. I deal with it on a near daily basis. In our criminal justice system, juries never have, and never did, play any role in deciding which searches or seizures violated the 4th. Amendment. These are always questions of law decided in hearings and arguments before judges. On the civil side of the law, individuals (because the phrase \"the people\" refers to individuals) can sue the government and have government officials punished financially for violations of their 4th. Amendment right. I doubt, however, that this is what Madison was referring to. The ability to file such a lawsuit did not exist until Congress passed legislation permitting it in 1979 (42 U.S.C. 1983). If we argue that Madison would have used the phrase \"the people\" to refer to jury vindication of a violation of a civil right, when juries were neither intended nor permitted to do so by any of his amendments, and in fact could not do so until authorized by congressional statute 200 years later, then we suggest that Madison should have a far greater reputation for prescience than Nostradamus. \n \n Amar completely fails to link such an oblique speculation. His only argument in favor of his guess (for that is all it is) is to point to an earlier, rejected draft of the 6th. Amendment right to trial by jury-chosen, presumably, because it contains the phrase \"as one of the best securities to the rights of the people, ought to remain inviolate.\" No where in this cited example does Madison state or even remotely suggest that juries should act collectively to protect the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure (nor does this imputation exist in the adopted 4th. Amendment). \n \n Use of this example does, ironically, support the individual right view. It is yet another example of Madison's penchant for including universally believed statements in the amendments he was drafting. These statements of principle, like the 2nd. Amendment militia preamble, have no impact on the right itself. They merely state one (of many) public rationales for the importance of protecting the right. The phrase quoted by Amar does not limit the 4th. Amendment right at all, it merely states that the right was viewed important enough to be included in his Bill of Rights (because it is one of the \"best securities\" of the rights of the people). The same is true of the militia preamble, which informs us that standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and that to secure a \"free\" state we should rely instead upon a militia. As I have argued before, there are many examples of Madison and other draftsmen of his time including these goals or principles with the substantive right. It is only with the RKBA that anyone seems encouraged to argue a statement of principle should be used as a rope to strangle the right it accompanies.",

   "\n Where did I say you had to serve full time to qualify for Second Amendment protection?

But the point is I never said you had to serve in the militia full time.

Might a person enroll and never be called to service? \n \n If the government never calls an individual to service, does that individual lose his right to keep and bear arms? When does this happen? After 1 year w/o service?, 10 years?, or 20 years? Is there any historical evidence that this is the case?\n \n \n Does each of us have a right to enroll ? Does government have a duty to enroll all of us? If so, what is to be done if the government refuses? If a person wants to enroll but is denied without cause by government , does that person still have a right to keep and bear arms? \n \n Doesn't the government naturally control who may (and who must) enroll in the organized militia? Does the right to keep and bears arms apply to militia that are not trained periodically? \n \n We have a right to keep and bear arms -which means at the very least that we have a right to keep arms and to render military service in person -but does that mean we have a right to enroll in the organized militia, or to decide when we will go on active duty and/or when we will be merely reserves?\n \n Does the second amendment require that the goverment train everyone? Or is the government free to organize and train only a portion of the militia?",

The first ten amendments to the constitution were not ratified until 1791. Three years later. Those papers do not refer to the bill of rights. In fact, there were only three authors, John Jay, James Madison, and alexander hamilton.\n \n In fact, lets look at one of the things that Hamilton says:\n \n \nIf standing armies are dangerous to liberty, an efficacious power over the militia, in the body to whose care the protection of the State is committed, ought, as far as possible, to take away the inducement and the pretext to such unfriendly institutions. If the federal government can command the aid of the militia in those emergencies which call for the military arm in support of the civil magistrate, it can the better dispense with the employment of a different kind of force. If it cannot avail itself of the former, it will be obliged to recur to the latter. To render an army unnecessary, will be a more certain method of preventing its existence than a thousand prohibitions upon paper. \n \n\n \n Clearly Hamilton envisioned the militia was the people of the country. He advised that the states be the ones to regulate such militias. However, he clearly intends that people be called up with their own weapons in case of insurrection and invasion.\n \n The right to keep and bear arms is essential as the point of \"calling up the militia was only in times of domestic disturbance (to include invasion) where every man will be in the path of destruction. The standing army for internal protection was never contemplated. An army would be contemplated for foreign wars.\n \n Huck",
