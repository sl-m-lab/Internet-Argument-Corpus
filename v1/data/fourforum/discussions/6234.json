   "LONDON: Police believe they foiled a potential Al Qaeda gas attack on British parliament, a newspaper reported on Sunday. \n \n The Sunday Times newspaper said the plot - to unleash sarin, a deadly nerve gas, on Britain's House of Commons - was uncovered through coded e-mails on computers seized from terror suspects in Britain and Pakistan. \n \n The newspaper said the e-mails were decoded with the help of an Al Qaeda operative working with police. The discovery of the plot led to the decision to increase security around parliament this summer, the newspaper said. \n \n A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said on Sunday that the force is \"not prepared to comment\" on the report. \n \n The paper claimed that an operation to deter the attack was referred to in an internal police document they had obtained. Citing an unidentified senior police officer, The Sunday Times said the plan involved a gas or chemical \"dirty bomb\" attack targeting the House of Commons and London's subway system. Extensive research and video-recorded reconnaissance had been carried out by the Al Qaeda cell plotting the foiled attack, the newspaper said. \n \n Police remained concerned about the possibility that suicide bombers could use one of London's famous black taxicabs to attack the parliament building, and were calling for a further increase in security, The Sunday Times said. \n \n One month on, and even with the suspected perpetrators in custody awaiting trial, mystery shrouds the failed attempt one month ago on Sunday to repeat the brutal July 7 bombings in London. \n \n Islamist extremists were reputedly behind both the July 7 and July 21 attacks on three Underground subway lines and a double-decker bus. agencies\n \n http://us.f533.mail.yahoo.com/ym/Compose?YY=29241\n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1272 \n Major Terror Attack at IGI Airport Averted with minutes to spare \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/955 \n NYC Subway Bomb Plot Foiled \n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/895\n Terrorist plan to flood London subways foiled\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/718\n Islamic concept of Al-Taqiyah to infiltrate and\n destroy kafir countries\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/382\n Jihad in France -- again -- : Bomb Alert Evacuates\n Paris Train Stations\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/289\n Al-Qaeda Targets London's Heathrow Airport",

   "Generalised threats of further attacks from Al Qaeda extremists are probably going to continue for the indefinite future: British (and American) people will have to adjust to living with them. The number and limited character of the \"security measures\" which are tolerable in a democratic society will always give the terrorists an edge in the duel between them and the police.",

The number and limited character of the \"security measures\" which are tolerable in a democratic society will always give the terrorists an edge in the duel between them and the police.\n\n \n Government pushing the number and character of security measures also reduces any remaining communication between government officials and the public they serve. When a high ranking US federal official visits a US city, sections of that city are immobilized by security measures. If cabinet level, the entire airport section, motorcade route and side visit portions of a city are declared off-limits with three city block buffers on each side with metropolitan and other LE plus military resources concentrated on the visit. During the past US national election the city I resided in had many comments about not being able to afford repeat visits by certain dignitaries. In that same context, US citizen protests are now removed from the area where any federal official is giving a speech, public or political, under new, anti-assembly legislation. \n \n Tolerable security levels in a democratic society, at least in the US, seems to be a viewpoint commanded by our government representatives and bureaucrats.",

   "That we should live to see such things! Our British parliamentarian (!), George Galloway did not allow Australian pastor Stuart Robinson to criticize Muslim assaultiveness. And who ever would have thought that it was said by not one of the leaders of the anti-war lobby in our Parliament, but by a real traitor of our state, fulfilling the next order of his Islamists' bosses! \n Due to documents, recently found at the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, George Galloway had lived under the protection of Saddam's Intelligence service and regularly received hundreds of thousands dollars for his open opposing the war in Iraq. A folder with this secret information was found by British journalist David Blair in one of the offices of Iraq's Foreign Department in Baghdad. As reported in these papers in 1990s Mr. Galloway constantly met with Iraqi intelligence officers, who gave him a detailed plan for working to the benefit of Iraq in the coming year. \n Galloway's net profit for it was at least 675 thousand of British pounds (or $563 thousand). In addition to it Mr. Galloway received profits from food contracts with Iraqi Ministry of Trade. Moreover, great financial receipts continue to move to his accounts from various Muslim organizations, located in GB and abroad. \n Thus, it has become clear that such \"financial impurity\" of Muslim's supporter produced Galloway's excluding from the Labour Party in 2003. But why should British people endure his presence in the British Parliament?",

   "Oh #### it! What a mess is now out there in Heathrow T5! A new &#8356;4.3 billion-worth terminal has become a national embarrassment when it was hit by severe baggage handling problems right after opening! How shameful! I think it were not such a great problem unless this chaos triggered a number of diplomatic incidents after several EU ministers lost their luggage while changing at Heathrow. I'm sure that our problem is that we fail to get our act together - that's what David Miliband has said in his blog. I also believe that what we've got in T5 is a factor that clearly indicates that this country is on the brink of collapse, while it also results worthless work of our government in the lead of Gordon Brown. Fish begins to stink at the head. Our government together with security services seem to be absolutely incapable, which has an adverse effect on every important sphere of our life. After Brown became PM, everything went wrong. First there was a banking crisis, then our team was defeated by Croatia. As for terror threat, from time to time Islamic extremists in GB commit terrorist attacks (like in Glasgow) but the authorities convince that these are only eventual incidents. That's no good! At this rate, with Gordon as a lead we will have our fill of sorrow. We need changes",
