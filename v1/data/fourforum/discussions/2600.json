   "oh yeah, i was to get back to this....\n \n here's what happened\n \n for the 3 days after Jesus died (which wasnt on a friday), soldiers were stationed at the tomb guarding it. some time that morning, before the sun rose, the soldiers were startled and abandoned their post, and God rolled the stone away (or maybe the angels themselves did, it doesnt say who). at dawn, Mary Magdelene and some of the other women came to embalm the body of Jesus. when they got there the stone was already moved and the tomb was empty. the 2 angels that moved the stone told them that Jesus had risen and go and tell the other disciples the good news. but some of the disciples doubted. so jesus appears to them in person that same day, in the room where they gathered, and the disciples finally saw him in person, except thomas who was absent. when thomas arriived he doubted the other disciples, so jesus showed up again and he was convinced. after that Jesus appeared to many other people throughout jerusalem for the next 40 days. at the time he was ready to ascend, he gave his disciples some final instructions \"go preach, etc\". then he floated up into the air\n \n thats basically the story. any questions?",

   "Hi Apathy:\n \n Apathy wrote << terral03, nope, i sure can't because there are conflicting accounts\n \n Terral's reply << I believe you are trying to put words in my mouth. We are a rude atheist are we? Okay. No, I am not telling you a story. You have four accounts from different perspectives in your Bible, about Christ as King, Man, Servant and the Son of God. Luke and Mark wrote from descriptions of accounts of others, and from compiling information over a period of time (Luke 1:1-4), and neither were counted among the disciples. \n \n Many seeming contradictions appear by comparing accounts, as they would by comparing letters written today by four of us, about events that transpired over a period of three years. Many skeptics assume that two of the writers are talking about the same event (like a particular healing of a leper, or Christ teaching or telling a story), when actually those things occurred a month or year apart (as if Christ only healed one leper in three years, or taught on a subject just once). Read very carefully what Luke says in the opening of his Gospel account: \n \n \"Inasmuch as Many have undertaken to compile an account of the things accomplished among us, just as THEY [as in MANY] were handed down to us by THOSE [as in other people] who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word, it seemed fitting for me as well, having investigated EVERYTHING [as in MANY versions of the very long story from various sources] carefully from the beginning, to write {it} out for you in consecutive order, most excellent Theophilus; so that you may know the exact truth about the things you have been taught.\" Luke 1:1-4. \n \n Evidence of a real conspiracy would be supported if all the accounts were identical. That would likely mean that some man fixed the documents. Again if there is a question over specific verses of Scripture you wish to have answered, I am more than happy to give you my best reply. But, do not expect us to make your case for you.\n \n Apathy << Sigh, I guess I don't have time to keep going. If I must I'll come back to this but there is more to life than arguing with Christians (it's so fun though).\n \n Terral's reply << Scripture says, \"But a natural man [our athiest visitor] does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised.\" 1Cor. 2:14. Therefore, I hold out little hope that Apathy will understand the answer he is given. Paul continues, \"But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by no one.\" 1Cor. 2:15. \n \n Please state your request in the form of a specific contradiction with Scriptural references. And the real fun shall begin. \n \n Regards,\n \n Terral \n \n Keep laughing. We shall see who laughs . . . last. If the atheists are right, then nothing matters.

God's Word does not make threats, it makes promises. My point is that there is no real value in holding onto the position of the atheist. God grants great rewards for the faithful, and those obedient to His Word, \"so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.\" Eph. 2:7. \n \n Again, if God's Word is correct, then the believer has blessings stored up for 'the ages to come.' What does the athiest really have to offer anyone? Except his unbelief? And what does God's Word say about that?\n \n \"He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son. But for the cowardly and UNBELIEVING and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part {will be} in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.\" Rev. 21:7+8.\n \n And I am not pointing out these warnings from a position of unbelief. So you guys can kid around about having fun with these topics all you like; belittle the faithful, put words in their mouths; haha, fun and games, so long as you also realize the consequences of poking fun at God's Word in unbelief.
