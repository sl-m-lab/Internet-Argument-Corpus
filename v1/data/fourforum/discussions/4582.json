   "From what I've read, the hardcore technofiles suggest front projectors if you're looking to go that large or larger. They seem to have a higher life-span as well. Plasma, while they may have a moderate lifetime rating, aren't at 100% over that lifetime. An expensive TV that looks worse after just a few years, can be damaged requiring a new screen, etc., didn't sound appealing to me. Then again, I'm no technofile, whatever that means :)\n \n -Mach",

I'm no technofile, but higher life-span and extended quality should equate into overall cost savings at that level and when it comes to quality, I'm cheap at heart. Installation won't take place until July of this year, which gives me adequate time to make the correct decision and adapt interior plans for platform and wiring installation purposes. \n \n I visited a pro A/V planning firm and quickly determined they're geared for commercial applications on a large scale and, like many such entities, scaling down is outside their mindset. While a modest network area for receipt and networked distribution of electrical services and entertainment is designated, this is a residence, not a sports bar with several dozen big screens and POS system including kitchen and accounting features. On the other side, a local computer guru, while knowledgeable about that end of it, is in the dark about tyeing in security, household electrical requirements and entertainment features to one server with redundancy. \n \n Sorry for the long post, but living outside major metro areas (thankfully) limits available expertise. Maybe someone can suggest an appropriate forum?",

I could see if mine can help if you would like. He started a new job that has a non competition clause attached to employment, so he does not sideline anymore, but he might be able to do something.\n \n As far as the disapearing screen, not a problem, but it leaves you with a big, ugly enclosure on your wall. Personally, I prefer the paint on screen. A white wall is never really out of place, and while there is allegedly some image quality loss over a traditional screen, I can't see it. \n \n Your top priority should probably be finding somebody who can recommend a projector and give you a proper focal length for it for the size you are after. I failed to do so when we were constructing our house, and ended up having to take out a wall and a ceiling to run cables. Very unpopular with the wife.\n \n you might also make allowances in the ceiling for speakers (walls, too). No need for ugly surface mounts. Most of the better speaker manufaturers now have good speakers available for in wall or in ceiling mount. A set of power/control wires terminating above windows to control your blinds is a good idea, since even if you do not put in electric blinds now, they can be added later if you wish, and you might start looking at lighting controls now. The ones I opted for just replace your original switch. There was a set made that I actually liked better, and allowed for better remote control, but they required a set of control wires, which would have required cutting into the wall that I had just had replaced. My wife would have killed me in my sleep.\n \n I know if I had to re-do my setup, the only thing I would really change is that I would have planned better from the start. It is good that you are taking these things into consideration as you go. Our original plan called for a standard wide screen high def with the standard controls. It was not until I went and visited my parents at their new house and saw the system my dad had put in (which is much better than mine....bigger picture and custom made theater style couch seating.....very cool) that I decided I wanted something a little different from the norm. \n \n My wife is not properly appreciative of the system, but my nieces and nephews certainly are. When they come over for family events, the first thing to happen is generally the connection of the Xbox. They love the system for their games.\n \n In the end, I don't spend enough time using it to really enjoy it or give a long term opinion of it. It was fun to set up, though, cheaper than you might expect, and is a cool \"guy toy\", so I will give it full marks.",

Of course. your picture cannot be better than the input. I like the high res (whcih obviously blows so called \"high res\" tv's out fo the water) for one other reason. if you are going to incorporate a PC into your entertainment system, you can use the projector as a monitor and it is actuallly useful, as opposed to most setups (even High res setups) where using the TV as a monitor makes for a terrible picture and illegible text.\n \n Using the projector as your monitor, though gives access to your MP3 collection. \n \n One mroe thing, you migh look into on the fly adjustable picture size. The way mine is set, movies and such are shown full screen,. but if youa re using the MP3 player function it only shows as a 17\" picture in the corner, and the picture is projected on a touchscreen (available on Ebay for about $35) so you have touchscreen controls for stereo MP3 functions. Probably not really necessary, but it can be a pain sorting through your MP3 collection, even with a good remote control setup (and do NOT skimp on the remote setup....it is the difference between a system that is easy and fun to use and one that is a pain in the butt to use).",

My wife would have killed me in my sleep..\n\n \n We have two sets of French doors and lots of windows on the South, view side of the house and discovered windows and French doors with mini-blinds that are self-contained between the window panes. Cleverest tech thing I've seen in years, full controls on the blinds with varying degrees of closure and complete/partial up or down, just like a free-standing, hung blind. The additional space between the panes actually increases thermal efficiency and of course no cleaning. \n \n Everything will also have white, interior, doored shutters inside the window frames and there's no way to automate them. We had them in our last house and I looked at that.",
