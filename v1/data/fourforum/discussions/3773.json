I think the upcomming movie Constantine...or whatever will shed some light on stuff...but I haven't read the reviews.....anyways...physical objects pass away...mental objects can't be realized fully......the physical and mental melded together would in a sense present the spiritual........so therefore the heaven, hell and the lake of fire are in a sense here but not realized......I don't know....I'm tired again and think I'm rambling.....read through it a couple times and maybe it will make more sense...I'm going to bed....",

Even the dogs came and licked his sores. \n 22 \"The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried. 23 In hell, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. 24 So he called to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.' \n \n 25 \"But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. 26 And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.' \n \n 27 \"He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father's house, 28 for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.' \n \n 29 \"Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.' \n \n 30 \"'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.' \n \n 31 \"He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.' \"\n \n WHAT JESUS CHRIST SAYS ABOUT HELL! \"fire\" Matt 7:19, 13:40, 25:41 \"everlasting fire\" Matt 18:8, 25:41 \"eternal damnation\" Mark 3:29 \"hell fire\" Matt 5:22, 18:9, Mark 9:47 \"damnation\" Matt 23:14, Mark 12:40, Luke 20:47 \"damnation of hell\" Matt 23:33 \"resurrection of damnation\" John 5:29 \"furnace of fire\" Matt 13:42, 50 \"the fire that never shall be quenched\" Mark 9:43, 45 \"the fire is not quenched\" Mark 9:44, 46, 48 \"Where their worm dieth not\" Mark 9:44, 46, 48 \"wailing and gnashing of teeth\" Matt 13:42, 50 \"weeping and gnashing of teeth\" Matt 8:12, 22:13, 25:30 \"torments\" Luke 16:23 \"tormented in this flame\" Luke 16:24 \"place of torment\" Luke 16:28 \"outer darkness\" Matt 8:12, 22:13 \"everlasting punishment\" Matt 25:46",
