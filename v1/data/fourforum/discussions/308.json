If he was God he would be omnipotent, and able to communicate directly to each and every human being and totally understood.\n \n Why did he only give the supposedly correct revelation to some weirdo eccentrics at different times in confusing riddles and contradictions? Well, the eccentrics may have fouled up the message. Why only Jewish eccentrics, and not Asians, Europeans, African, Native Americans?\n \n In fact if there is a god, which I doubt, then why didn't he reveal his required beliefs to all of us all over the world? If there are certain beliefs about God that are critical and need to be believed to be saved, God should make those beliefs clear and unambiguous.\n \n Instead we get all revelations from so-called prophets, whose eccentricities make me question their credibility. All revelation is hearsay, and could in fact be all lies, or retelling of hallucinations. We have no way to distinguish them. The only way revelation would be reliable is for God to give it to each and everyone of us identical in its content, not confusing, not ambiguous, not in strange riddles as done in the Bible.\n \n Cuchulainn",

   "Originally posted by debategirl88 \n He doesnt talk to us now because we have the Bible... the bible is Gods word. It tells us all we need to know. Look up John 1:1. \n \n \n I noticed that. Fundies have created a new god called the HOLY BIBLE. They never say \"God says according to the Bible.\" They say, \"The Bible says\". The Bible says. I thought it was a book. Books don't talk. They are only written records. I saw a Southern Baptist Church 10 years ago. They had a gold trimmed CERAMIC Bible open half-way, but of course not readable. It was on a pedestal in front of the pulpit, as a idol for worship. They carry it around like some magic charm or portable idol most of the time not actually reading it.\n \n There are many scriptures at least as credible or more so than the Bible (Qur'an, Torah/Talmud, Hindu Vedas, Zoroastrian, Buddhist, and minority religions.) There is no objective measure to give the Christian Bible credibility over any of the other scriptures. It is full of errors, contradictions, absurdities, gross immorality, injustice, cruelty, and just plain insanity (Revelations).\n \n America was the result of a revulation by Deist freethinkers against the established Christian Theocracy of 1776. The Constitution gave full rights to believe or not believe and not be punished for non-conformity of belief. While Europe is shedding all but the symbolism of monarchy and achieving real secular democracy on the individual level, America is sliding down the greasy skid to Authoritarian Dictatorship, based on Biblical Principles.\n \n The American Revolution was a repudiation of the Bible in every sense. Unlike the Bible, the Constitution confers the rights you still have left. There are no RIGHTS in the BIBLE. The Constitution does not meantion God or gods. It prohibits the establishment of religion (not \"a\" religion, not a sect, not a cult) but OF RELIGION. Religion cannot be used as a test of your Americanism.\n \n The Fundamentalist McCarthyism sweeping America is a sad drift toward third world Theocratic Totalitarianism. Christian Fundamentalism is the enemy of freedom and the real threat to good freedom loving Americans (not some bloody Muslim Fundamentalist terrorists). \n \n The anti-intellectualism, the anti-science, anti-inquiry, anti-thinking components of the Religious Reich is like a lethal virus that threatens the life of the American Secular Democratic Republic.\n \n Lurch, if true Americans in the image of Paine, Jefferson, Madison, and Franklin, need to launch part II of the American Revolution, we Europeans who admire America and freedom will be there with you like Lafayette, von Steuben, Pulaski, and Paine. Take your country back from the fanatics.\n \n Cuchulainn",
