   "AJ is running a story on fallujah. \n \n Address is http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/23FBDBB2-C104-4E69-BA80-F476CC64C4A1.htm\n \n \nIraqis returning to Falluja have found their properties either vandalized or demolished and now live in more of a ghetto than a city, according to a national TV station.\n\n \n \n As usual, no really good pictures (the pictures shown are the outskirts of the city). Today they had a live \"exchange\" with US troops outside fallujah. An AJ reporter wanted to go into fallujah and was shot at, then held at gun point by US troops. Reporters are NOT allowed in the city, nor are any pictures allowed to be taken inside the city except for purposes of identifying bodies (which is why all the body photos from fallujah). I would personally like to see the story from today (the marines firing on reporters to keep them from showing the wholesale destruction of fallujah) get picked up by the US media so the drooling XXXXXX in this country will quit saying things like \"We haven't leveled any cities. We only use PRECISION munitions\".",

   "http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/fallujah-imagery.htm\n\n \n Jim, i realise that not everybody knows how to interpet sattelite imagry, so here is a crash course. First, in order to compare these images you need to save them, then shharepen the edges (in one you need to actually use a \"find edges\" command sinc eit is a really poor photo). then, you need to superimpose one on the otehr and play with your transparency setting unitl you can see both photos. These are such wide view shots (5 meter shot is the best) that if you do not superimpose them, you would be hard pressed to see any differences at all.\n \n On this page, all that really matters are the 3 comparitive views at the bottom. the first one is a 20 meter view. You would be hard pressed to pick out a Semi in that one. It is not going to tell us anything about damage. The second is the same. The third is a 5 meter view, and nearly every building in the photo has been heavily damaged (again, superimpose the views). \n \n \n \nhttp://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/fallujah_poststrike_01.htm\n\n \n This is another one where the after photo shows extensive damage to almost every building. Use your \"find edges\" command and superimpose. Keep in mind that a 5 meter view means that you should be able to see anything at least 5 meters SQUARE. A 5 meter view is broad enough that all you can do is compare edge contorus and look for differences, and assume the differences are damage. Kind of hard to tell for sure, since such low resolution does not even allow you to pick out vehicles (though you may not you can see a few large trucks (semis or dump trucks) in a parking lot in the upper center of the photo.\n \n \nCheck it out.\n \n Anyone can take a picture of a single crumbled building and report that the city has been leveled. What a waste of time.\n\n \n The red cross is transpoting thousands fo tents to the area because they say there is not a single habitable building left in the city.\n \n Here is an articel from fox news (so it must be true) about the damage in fallujah:\n \n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,143965,00.html\n \n \nFew houses escaped damage from the intense American air raids late last year and the insurgent bombings and shootings that followed. Work teams have cleared rubble from the streets, but it is still tangled with downed power lines. Craters cut off access to side streets, and some buildings have walls or ceilings missing if they weren't simply destroyed.\n\n \n Here is another story from an american source (since you apparently don't trust those dirty foreigners).\n \n http://www.news24.com/News24/World/Iraq/0,,2-10-1460_1640010,00.html\n \n \n If \"leveled\" is too specific a term for you, how about \"completely destroyed\", which is how the commander of US troops there described it. \n \n Here is a story from Reuters:\n \n http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/1224-02.htm\n \n \n \n http://www.news24.com/News24/World/Iraq/0,,2-10-1460_1640010,00.html",
