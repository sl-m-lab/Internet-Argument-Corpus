I had heard RECENTLY that some ( yes maybe Democratic \"politicians\") had burnt the flag and I wanted to know their reasoning.. And as the you burning the flag yes it is free speech but where did the morals go? people take free speech to the extremes. weve lost all sense of propriety and order. especially in the U.S. And everything will not be gone. If we stand against these people then its not gone.",
