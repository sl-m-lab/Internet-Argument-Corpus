   "Bush's Failed Mideast Policy is Creating More Terrorism\n \n by U.S. Senator Ernest F. Hollings\n \n WITH 760 DEAD (now 832) in Iraq and over 3,000 maimed for life, home folks continue to argue why we are in Iraq -- and how to get out.\n \n Israel long since would have taken us to the weapons of mass destruction if there were any or if they had been removed. With Iraq no threat, why invade a sovereign country? The answer: President Bush's policy to secure Israel.\n ...\n Led by Wolfowitz, Richard Perle and Charles Krauthammer, for years there has been a domino school of thought that the way to guarantee Israel's security is to spread democracy in the area.\n ...\n Pres. Bush came to office imbued with one thought -- re-election. Bush felt tax cuts would hold his crowd together and spreading democracy in the Mideast to secure Israel would take the Jewish vote from the Democrats.\n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=2827\n \n \n Sen. Hollings Blasts Israeli Lobby\n \n In a speech May 20 on the Senate floor, the South Carolina Democrat blasted the pro-Israel lobby for the second time this month and suggested that presidents and lawmakers for years have followed policy prescribed by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. \"You can't have an Israel policy other than what AIPAC gives you...\" Hollings said.\n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=2981\n \n \n Gen. Anthony Zinni Exposes Zionist Influence in Washington\n \n In the interview, Zinni blamed Jews for the Iraq quagmire, and he wants their heads to fall. In particular a group of top neocons: Douglas Feith, Paul Wolfowitz, Lewis Libby, Richard Perle, and Elliot Abrams -- the ones who caused this war to occur.\n \n He says their real justification for pushing the US to war were not the three stated by the Administration -- weapons of mass destruction, terror links, or gross human rights violations. Rather, it was to secure Israel, and to remake the Middle East.\n \n \"I think it's the worst kept secret in Washington. That everybody - everybody I talk to in Washington - has known and fully knows what their agenda was and what they were trying to do,\" says Zinni.\n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=2967",

Democracy in the Middle East does the same thing for both of our countries as it will make us safer.
