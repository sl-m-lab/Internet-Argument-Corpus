   "I would like to address the theory of evolution point-by-point. Since I do not want to misrepresent the theory, I have used an explanation of Darwin's theory from Gould's book, \"Full House.\" On page 138, Gould states:\n \n 1) All organisms tend to produce more offspring than can possibly survive.\n \n 2) Offspring vary among themselves, and are not carbon copies of an immutable type.\n \n 3) This variation is passed down by inheritance to future generations. (We know that black folks have black kids; white folks, white kids; tall parents tend to have tall children; and so on.)\n \n 4)If many offspring must die (for not all can be accommodated in nature's limited ecology), and individuals in all species vary among themselves, then on average survivors will tend to be those individuals with variations that are fortuitously best suited to changing local environments. Since heredity exists, the offspring of survivors will tend to resemble their successful parents. The accumulation of these favorable variants through time will produce evolutionary change.\n \n Ok.....let's start with #1:\n \n All organisms tend to produce more offspring than can possibly survive.\n \n While this sounds reasonable at first, if you dissect it, it makes no sense. First of all, just off the top of my head, if I use human beings, I can quickly refute that statement. Human beings are born all the time, and there is no such logic that says that humans produce more offspring than can survive. And since human evolution is where most of the conflict is, I'd say this is a pretty important.\n \n So strike one.\n \n Next...notice how Gould says that organisms produce more offspring than CAN possbily survive. What the statement should read is that organisms produce more offspring than DO survive. Can and DO have completely different meanings.....and here is the crux where I differ with evolutionists. By saying that there is only a small percentage of offspring that CAN survive, I believe they are incorrect. Granted, you will certainly have a runt or two in every litter, but the vast majority of offspring of many animals certainly CAN and DO survive. It's only afterwards, during life's lottery, that certain organisms die or survive. And since they each orgnansim is constructed in a way that all are physically equally able to breed, then the process of who breeds is essentially a random process. Strike 2.\n \n \n Offspring vary among themselves, and are not carbon copies of an immutable type.\n \n Stop the Press! Evolutionists often just glide over this very important point. Indeed, each creature in a population is not a carbon copy of the next....HOWEVER...the notion that these differences can spell the difference between who breeds and who doesn't is in huge error. Humans, for instance vary widely in appearance...but does that mean that some of us will be genetically less likely to breed? That makes no sense. Same with birds -- who all look basically the same in a given population. Or worms...or penguins...it's the same the world over. Strike III.\n \n \n 3) This variation is passed down by inheritance to future generations. (We know that black folks have black kids; white folks, white kids; tall parents tend to have tall children; and so on.)\n \n Ok....this may be true...however, not necessarily. Epigenetics tells us that the a mother mouse's diet can effect the coat color of baby mice....with a diet high in protein (I think it's protein?)...can induce a darker coat color in offspring. There is no change in DNA -- just a change in phenotype. Strike Four.\n \n 4)If many offspring must die (for not all can be accommodated in nature's limited ecology), and individuals in all species vary among themselves, then on average survivors will tend to be those individuals with variations that are fortitously best suited to changing local environments.\n \n Finally..we have the biggest error of all. I've bolded the part that destroys everything. Of course it is now shown that variation is not necessarily random -- and maybe not random at all. So since variation is not random, then all animals of a given population will change at the same time from the same enviornmental cues. Thus, there is no way that selection will have a variant to choose from. In order for Toe to stand, variation MUST be random. If it's not, the whole thing falls...as stated here by Mark Ridley:\n \n The theory of directed variation\n \n It is a deep property of Darwinism that the direction of evolution, particularly of adaptive evolution, is uncoupled from the direction of variation. When a new recombinant or mutant genotype arises, there is no tendency for it to arise in the direction of improved adaptation. Natural selection imposes direction on evolution, using undirected variation. An alternative viewpoint is the theory of directed variation. \n \n Indeed, with directed variation, an alternative explanation for evolution would be needed...because directed mutation eliminates the creative role of selection.\n \n and Gould himself:\n \n UNDIRECTED. \n \n In a sense, the specter of directed variability threatens Darwinism even more seriously than any putative failure of the other two postulates. Insufficient variation stalls natural selection; saltation deprives selection of a creative role but still calls upon Darwin's mechanism as a negative force. With directed variation, however, natural selection can be bypassed entirely. If adaptive pressures automatically trigger heritable variation in favored directions, then trends can proceed under regimes of random mortality; natural selection, acting as a negative force, can, at most, accelerate the change. (Gould 2002: 145) \n \n (....) Darwin clearly understood the threat of directed variability to his cardinal postulate of creativity for natural selection. He explicitly restricted the sources of variation to auxiliary roles as providers of raw material, and granted all power over the direction of evolutionary change to natural selection.... He recognized biased tendencies to certain states of variation, particularly reversions toward ancestral features. But he viewed such tendencies as weak and easily overcome by selection. Thus, by the proper criterion of relative power and frequency, selection controls the direction of change: \"When under nature the conditions of life do change, variations and reversions of character probably do occur; but natural selection, as will hereafter be explained, will determine how far the new characters thus arising shall be preserved (p. 15) (Gould 2002: 145) \n \n Strike 5",

Human beings are born all the time, and there is no such logic that says that humans produce more offspring than can survive.\n\n Did you notice the word \"tend\" in there?\n \n Humans (in general) are actually very careful about protecting their young. Many organisms just produce a few thousand offspring and leave. Obviously, all of those offspring cannot survive.\n \nAnd since human evolution is where most of the conflict is, I'd say this is a pretty important.\n\n \"A pretty important\"?\n Actually, not really. The ToE has evidence from all over the various domains of life. Human evolution isn't too much more relevant than bacterial evolution.\n \nSo strike one.\n\n For you?\n \nNext...notice how Gould says that organisms produce more offspring than CAN possbily survive. What the statement should read is that organisms produce more offspring than DO survive. Can and DO have completely different meanings.....and here is the crux where I differ with evolutionists. By saying that there is only a small percentage of offspring that CAN survive, I believe they are incorrect.\n\n You are using that type of argument (logical fallacy, actually) known as a strawman. It is worth noting (that means pay attention) that it is not always a \"small percentage\" which survives.\n Types of reproduction involve two different techniques: lay a few thousand eggs and hope some will survive (fish, misquitos), and have a few offspring and put a lot of energy into protecting them (people).\n \n The first technique can be accurately referred to with \"only a small percentage of offspring can survive,\" but the second cannot.\n \nGranted, you will certainly have a runt or two in every litter, but the vast majority of offspring of many animals certainly CAN and DO survive. \n\n I hope you don't mean the hundreds of spider offspring or all of the offspring of a fish...\n In fact, there are many more species of animal which use the \"make hundreds/thousands of offspring\" method than species who don't.\n \nIt's only afterwards, during life's lottery, that certain organisms die or survive. \n\n \"Lottery\"? I hope you don't mean that it is completely random in all cases...\n \n Note: did you notice that this was the position you were arguing against in the previous sentence?\n \nAnd since they each orgnansim is constructed in a way that all are physically equally able to breed, then the process of who breeds is essentially a random process. \n\n Not all \"orgnansims\" are able to breed. Some are sterile (mules or ones with mutations), some die in the \"lottery\" (which is biased against certain traits), and some simply breed less (those who can't get as much food, for example).\n \nStrike 2.\n\n He's almost out, folks!\n \nOffspring vary among themselves, and are not carbon copies of an immutable type.\n \n Stop the Press! Evolutionists often just glide over this very important point. Indeed, each creature in a population is not a carbon copy of the next....HOWEVER...the notion that these differences can spell the difference between who breeds and who doesn't is in huge error. Humans, for instance vary widely in appearance...but does that mean that some of us will be genetically less likely to breed? That makes no sense. \n\n Not \"genetically\"; \"statistically\" is more accurate.\n Yes, even some people are statistically less likely to breed. There are currently many solutions to problems which would usually be disabling to people, but selection is evident in countries without those solutions.\n \nSame with birds -- who all look basically the same in a given population. \n\n How something \"looks basically\" is basically irrelevant. How well a bird flies is very important. If a bird is born with feathers in the wrong position, it will probably not fly well and will have a much harder time evading predators.\n \nStrike III.\n\n And he's out!\n \n By the way, why did you say \"strike III\" and not \"strike 3\"?\n \n3) This variation is passed down by inheritance to future generations.

One obvious error is bolded for you to see.\n \nFinally..we have the biggest error of all. I've bolded the part that destroys everything. \n\n Including the universe?\n \nOf course it is now shown that variation is not necessarily random -- and maybe not random at all. So since variation is not random, then all animals of a given population will change at the same time from the same enviornmental cues. \n\n First: \"...maybe not random at all.\"\n Next: \"so since variation is not random...\"\n One error found.\n \n Conclusion: \"all members of a population will change at the same time.\"\n Two errors found.\n \n Environmental cues will not cause a specific change. Selective pressures, on the other hand, will support a specific change (or multiple changes).\n \nThus, there is no way that selection will have a variant to choose from. \n\n Ouch.

   "And can you please tell me the difference between nonrandom variation and directed variation? I'd also like a link to verify what you say. Thank you. God Bless!\n\n \n Not between nonrandom variation and directed variation: between nonrandom amounts of variation, and directed variation.\n \n For instance, if I heat up a kettle of water, the motion of the liquid becomes more violent. The amount of motion is non-random, linked as it is to the temperature of the water, but the motion itself is random.\n \n Is that satisfactory?\n \n Taking things a step further, we can also observe that the motion of the water, while random, is nevertheless constrained by the kettle. This is analogous to the 'developmental constraints' mentioned in the article you quote. I confess to seeing nothing problematic for the ToE in the idea that natural selection would favour genomes that are less susceptible to some mutations than to others.",

   "hi it's me.....I clicked on those links. you've nothin', man.\n\n He just denies it.\n Why don't you debate me head-to-head rather than dodging?\n \nAren't you man enough to debate me head-to-head with what I present?\n\n Ok, I will.Let's go back to what you posted:\n \nEvolutionary biologists are not at a loss to accomodate the evidence that the rate of evolution is dependent on the rate of mutation. We now understand that, in a finite world, where variation and time are not infinitely abundant, the non-randomness of variation (long recognized by geneticists) is expected to have a crucial influence on the course of evolution.\n\n Variation does tend to have a pattern. It is usually drawn as a bell curve, with the top portion being the most common variation on a trait. \n \nIndeed, for several decades, molecular evolutionists have relied on an evolutionary view that abandons the Darwinian presumption of abundant pre-existing variation, assuming instead that the rate of evolution depends directly on the rate of introduction of new alleles by mutation.\n\n Interesting, but it appears to ignore the fact that there is pre-existing variation (just look at the pictures). Emphasizing mutations is ok, but relying solely on them will probably skew results.\n \nFor instance, highly successful modern methods of phylogenetic inference assume such a dependence implicitly when they implement different rates for transition and transversion changes. Likewise, for two decades, developmental evolutionists have been emphasizing the importance of developmental \"constraints\" that influence course of evolution via their effects on the generation of variation. \n \n Thus, while there are clearly common threads linking past and present thought in evolutionary biology, the evolutionary theory of today is not that of Darwin, nor even that of Darwin's mid-20th-century successors.\n\n \"The\"? There is no single interpretation of the ToE. There is a debate going on between supporters of Punctuated Equilibrium and Gradualism, for example. It doesn't matter that this website asserts that this one interpretation is accepted.\n \n I don't think I accept it, but I don't know for sure, as you seem to have chosen a website which is unclear on some points. (Of course, the websites that are not unclear don't often support your point of view...)\n \nThis yet-to-be-named new view,\n\n If it is that new, then it is not universally accepted (even within biologists).\n \nwith its empirical emphasis on rates and patterns of divergence, and its reliance on, not only natural selection, but also mutation biases and developmental constraints as causes of non-randomness in evolution, [it] has already enjoyed considerable success.\n\n I have a few problems with this section (or at least your interpretation):\n 1) It is not asserting that mutations proceed only in a certain direction (mutations are not pre-selected for benefit).\n 2) If you are saying that variation is not random and that mutations happen in response to environmental pressures, note that there is no known mechanism which could decide which mutation should occur.\n \nI don't debate long, rambling philosophical nonsense.\n\n But you debate with it?\n \nIf you have a specific topic from any of those you'd like to discuss I'll be glad to talk it over with you.\n\n Sure. I would like to discuss the first one. It shows obvious similarities that are almost certainly not coincidencial.\n \n In part I, the fish and salamander look similar to everything else (note the curvature and the small flaps under the head).\n \n However, in parts II and III, the fish and salamander begin to look different.\n \n \n You can see where this is leading, right? It is leading to the assertion that these organisms are related, but that the fish and reptiles are not as closely related to the mammals as the mammals are related to each other.\n \n This assertion is also backed up by the fossil record, but that isn't as visible as this picture.",
