All I said was that the title of this thread (blob of tissue my butt) was funny because I had just found out that I had hemmorrhoids. Maybe you think I was joking or something or making light of abortion but I really do have them and it sucks. You need a chill pill.\n \n BTW, I have an unplanned and unwanted pregnancy last night and I had an abortion. It really was the best thing for me. I can't imagine myself right now having a toddler (which I would if I had carried through) and not being able to go to school or missing all of the opportunities that I've worked so hard for. I'm not flippant about it and I hope to never have one again. Unfortunately I did make a mistake by having sex before replenishing my birth control supply. \n \n You honestly cannot believe that telling people to not have sex before marriage will actually lower the abortion rates. People will and are going to have sex, you know that...if you don't you're an idiot. The thing that we need to do for young people who want to have sex is give them free and safe access to family planning doctors...give out free birth control and condoms. Throw them on the sidewalks...pass them out at school. I know that is extreme, haha, but I really think the best thing is for kids to be safe in the activities they are going to do anyways. My sister is 17 and I really wish she was on birth control...but it really isn't my place and my dad might not be too happy. Also, what is this \"free sex\" nonsense...I didn't know sex cost anything unless you're doing it with a hooker. \n \n What about those people who don't want to get married. Are you telling everyone who wants to have sex that they have to enter into this particular union? What about those who cannot have children...are they allowed to have sex before marriage in your eyes? \n \n Honestly, you really should open your eyes to the reality. I love it how Christians and the far right in general like to tell us all the things we should be doing even if they are completely implausable and ridiculous and THEY KNOW it will never happen. It is so EASY to say stop having sex so that you really don't have to do anything about it. You know it isn't going to happen...",
