   "Meanwhile, in the Anglican church,\n \n \"(RNS) The Episcopal Church has been removed from Anglican committees that engage in dialogue with other Christians and consider doctrinal issues, the latest fallout from the church's consecration of a lesbian bishop last month.\n \n The Rev. Kenneth Kearon, secretary general of the Anglican Communion, the worldwide fellowship that includes the Episcopal Church as its U.S. branch, outlined the demotions in a letter published on Monday (June 7).\n \n Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, the spiritual leader of the communion, proposed the removals last month after Episcopalians in Los Angeles consecrated an open lesbian as an assistant bishop. Bishop Mary Douglas Glasspool is the second openly gay bishop in the Episcopal Church, after Bishop V. Gene Robinson of New Hampshire, who was consecrated in 2003.\n \n After Robinson's consecration, all 44 member churches in the Anglican Communion were asked to abide by three moratoria: no more gay bishops, no official blessings for same-sex unions, no interfering in each other's provinces.\n \n While most Episcopalians support ordaining gays and lesbians as bishops, many Anglicans in the 77-million-member communion view homosexuality as a sin, and have angrily confronted the Episcopal Church. Williams had warned Episcopalians that consecrating Glasspool would have \"consequences\" for their role in the communion.\"\n Episcopalians Booted from Anglican Bodies Over Gay Bishops - News",

   "Quoting the OLD TESTAMENT. \n \n Fast forward to the NEW TESTAMENT teaching of Christ, and what part of \"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone\" have you never read or understood?\n\n \n actually, its from the new testament. see that? mark 7:9-10? new testament. are you understanding now or should i continue? i will anyways just to make sure. the second gospel in the new testament is the gospel of mark. mark 7:9-10 is in the gospel of mark. mark 7:9-10 is in the new testament. i suggest buying a new bible that doesnt have the gospel of mark listed as being from the old testament.\n \n \n \nThat's a lousy exegesis of that scripture.\n \n Why not use a good modern translation so you can understand things better?\n \n \"Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord.\" (Luke 2:23 - NIV)\n \n All people (males and females) are justified righteous and holy by faith in Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9, etc.), not by their works, sex, or birth order, etc. You knew that, right?\n\n \n MODERN translation? i looked it up and according to bible.cc that quotation is from a 1984 translation of the bible. the translation i quoted is from 2001 english standard translation (in england). how about the american standard?:\n \"as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord\"\n or maybe the international translation from 2008?:\n \"as it is written in the law of the Lord, 'Every firstborn son is to be designated as holy to the Lord.'\"\n \n no mention of females in any quote, including yours...\n \n so again, i think you need to get a new bible, one not from 1984 so you can quote scriptures as being actually modern instead of trying to pass it off as being modern hoping i wont notice - which i will.\n \n and thats another thing, the bible is chalk full of contradictions. one verse will say only males are holy to God, others will say that everyone is holy to God. and of course, religious people choose the latter one to teach and straight up ignore the sexist one. now thats wrong, isnt it? if it really was the word of God, you would teach every one, including the old testament.\n \n \n \nI'm wondering why you're ignoring New Testament teachings in an attempt to defend the iniquity of gay sex debauchery? Did you really think you accomplished something with this woeful, sophomoric attack on the New Testament?\n\n \n i didnt ignore the new testament, i quoted two snippits of the new testament - could have quoted a lot more - to display the bible's (new testament) absurdity. why would we trust anything it says when it contains such debauchery? you could equally use the bible to argue against women or against child protection services as you can to argue against homosexuality.\n \n remember, everything in the bible is the word of God and if you dont follow the word of God, youre going to hell.",

I think that's the great drawback to universalism: ultimately it leads to a situation where there's nothing concrete. \n And it seems to be based on the presupposition that dogma is a bad thing, which it is not.\n\n \n This is an interesting analysis, but I don't think you are right. First, I don't think we Unitarian Universalists view theological dogma or doctrine as bad necessarily; it's just not what our faith espouses. We work often with Christian and Jewish and Muslim groups, and it's fine with us that they espouse doctrine. We don't oppose people of other faiths coming together around common theological doctrine. We just choose not to do this ourselves. (A friend of mine who is a Disciples of Christ minister pointed out that the Disciples are also a non-doctrinal faith.) \n \n Our choice not to espouse a common theological doctrine does not mean we are not a religion. We come together to worship. We have a shared set of principles that reflect our values as a faith, though these principles are not theological. They are principles for living together in community and in the world. We encourage each individual within our faith to develop his or her own understanding of that which is unknown....call it God or the spirit of life or whatever name you choose. I personally believe in God. I worship God at my church and in my personal life. \n \n Ours is a faith in which we do not espouse a single common theological doctrine. People who find this unsatisfying should certainly choose a different faith. We do not evangelize, and we do not claim to know \"the truth.\" We encourage each person to seek his or her own understanding of truth. One of our shared principles is that we covenant to affirm \"the free and responsible search for truth and meaning.\" Our members thus embrace different views of truth, different theologies. Unitarian Universalism is not for everyone. But for those of us who find a church home in Unitarian Universalism, our faith is deeply meaningful and significant. It certainly is for me. \n \n I appreciate your willingness to raise questions about our faith. Feel free to do so anytime.",

First, let's review the New Testament principle you still haven't properly addressed:\n \n Concerning stoning and putting sinners to death: What part of \"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone\" have you never read or understood?\n \n As for quoting the Old Testament and the New Testament - nothing has changed on gay sex sin. It's still a sin. The moral laws have not changed. Adultery remains a sin in the New Testament as well as the Old. Same with thievery, idolatry, and a host of other moral sins. \n \n However, stoning has changed - capital punishment in the New Testament is now up to God or the government (Romans 13). But not for the disciples or believers to engage in apart from government. Are you starting to get the picture now?\n \n So, it's proper to quote the OT when it's applicable to the NT. It's not recommended to do it as you're doing when something has changed.\n \n If you're going to try to be astute regarding Biblical theology, you have to understand what has changed and what hasn't.\n \n Gay sex remains a sin.",

   "It certainly is convenient that you can declare (on no basis other than what some people have chosen to believe) that some parts of the Old Testament apply today while others do not.\n\n \n That is certainly not the only basis. The OT law is a complicated issue which is the subject of many books and much research throughout the entire history of both Judaism and Christianity. There's nothing convenient about it. But we do need to call a spade and spade, and clearly there is a differences between ceremonial admonitions of cleanness/uncleanness and ones pertaining to sexual behavior. You assert people are just reading this the way they've been taught (anti-gay, of course, from your perspective) but that's exactly what you're doing by taking an anything-but-gay approach when interpreting fairly clear passages in the OT. You're bringing your prejudices to the text by putting the exception over the standard in terms of interpretation here. \n \n \nSince men lying with men appears in the same sections of the Bible as the proscriptions against eating shellfish, how do you know that the parts about men lying with men are not ceremonial also? Or do you assume that because someone told you that these are \"moral\" while the shellfish eating is just \"ceremonial\" that one is not okay and the other is okay? \n\n \n Because there are plenty of other food-related laws; admonitions against pork for instance. Ritual uncleanliness was a major theme in the OT law and the ancient view was that what was eaten determined whether someone was unclean or not. There were many laws about various foods. The admonition of a man laying with a man pertained to sexual behavior. There is no indication, from context there or elsewhere, that the admonitions about sexual relationships had anything to do with ritualism; it was rather basic moralistic guidelines, of which are also common in the OT law. There are many laws like this as well.\n \n Jesus' indication in Matthew 5-7 (known as the 'sermon on the mount') were that he wasn't signaling an end to moral guidelines themselves. If anything, he called for going even farther! (going the extra mile, not just adultery but no lust, not just murder, but no harboring hate, etc.) He calls for dealing with these issues internally, not just externally. And he makes it clear that the human race will never be able to live up to these internal moral guidelines without the help of God. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't still try to live up to the moral standards prescribed. He said as such himself, as recorded in Matt 5:17.\n \n Incidentally, there are a lot of Christians in the world that indeed DON'T eat shellfish or pork, so they are being consistent in the way they obey these laws. This avoidance is pretty common in the Eastern Orthodox tradition. People tend to associate avoiding pork with Judaism, but in various parts of Christendom, it is avoided by Christians as well.",

   "To Jyoshu: I'm still having trouble posting directly in response to your posts. Oh, well. \n \n You write the following: \"clearly there is a differences between ceremonial admonitions of cleanness/uncleanness and ones pertaining to sexual behavior.\"\n \n Why? Because you say so? Because conservative interpreters of the Bible say so? Where does the Bible say this? You and others appear to be interpreting the Bible as YOU want to, which is what you accuse people who interpret the Bible differently from you of doing. There is nothing in the Bible that says that the prohibitions in the Old Testament on eating shellfish are fundamentally different from the prohibitions against a man lying with another man, the meaning of which is not clear anyway and has been the subject of argument by Bible scholars. The only reason people claim that the one is \"ceremonial\" and can thus be ignored while the other is \"moral\" and thus must be held up as heinous sin is because some people decided to believe this. It's nowhere in the Bible. \n \n I have no problem with people saying that this is their interpretation of the Bible, but they must then concede that there are other ways to interpret the Bible than what they claim is what it says. And because there are other interpretations, perhaps people who condemn same-sex intimacy as \"sin\" need to concede that they may be wrong about this, or at least that other Christians do not interpret the Bible in the same way that they do. \n \n I personally do not interpret the Old Testament at all as part of my faith, as I do not subscribe to the Bible as the word of God or as authoritative. The Bible is not my scripture. I also do not believe in the concept of sin. I point out simply that you, no less than people who interpret the Bible differently from you, are engaging in interpretation, and this interpretation of yours may be self-serving and simply reflect the prejudices that you and others of your age hold. You accuse Christians who support same-sex marriage of being self-serving in their interpretations of the Bible, and I will argue back to you that your interpretations are probably no less self-serving.\n \n As for Easyrider's quotation from the Gospel of John of Jesus' supposed statement about casting the first stone, Christian Bible scholars have raised serious questions about whether this story is true and whether it should be included in the Bible: \n \n Is 'Let Him Who Is Without Sin Cast the First Stone' Biblical? | Christianity Today | A Magazine of Evangelical Conviction\n \n I personally like the story of the woman who committed adultery and Jesus challenging his followers not to condemn her. I think it is a great lesson. But it appears that Jesus may not have said this. Much of what is attributed to Jesus in the Gospel of John seems to have been invented later by followers of Jesus. Much of it does not appear in the other three canonical Gospels. The Gospel of John differs significantly from the other 3.",

Considering all we know about the culture and all the other admonitions about sexual issues, it makes a heck of a lot more sense to read these, er, obvious statements about things like a 'man-laying-with-a-man' as, well, a man laying with a man. That's what it says. You can say you don't want to live by that rule all you want, but don't act like it doesn't say what it clearly says. It does say that.\n \n \nI have no problem with people saying that this is their interpretation of the Bible, but they must then concede that there are other ways to interpret the Bible than what they claim is what it says.\n\n \n Then why are you arguing about this?

You may be wrong too. As may I. That's part of taking a position and arguing. But based on Biblical historic and theological study, I conclude that the Bible probably does indicate a moralistic position that gay sex--particularly between two men--is a forbidden thing. To me, it's a debate that is disingenuous, frankly, because it ignores the obvious as if it's not the obvious. That the Bible forbids gay sex isn't even a serious question, IMO. Someone has to have quite an a agenda already to come to take this 2000 year-old agrarian text and try to make it NOT condemn gay sex any number of sexual activities that it frowns upon.\n \n \nYou accuse Christians who support same-sex marriage of being self-serving in their interpretations of the Bible, and I will argue back to you that your interpretations are probably no less self-serving.\n\n \n That's all I'm saying to you.

Considering all we know about the culture and all the other admonitions about sexual issues, it makes a heck of a lot more sense to read these, er, obvious statements about things like a 'man-laying-with-a-man' as, well, a man laying with a man. That's what it says. You can say you don't want to live by that rule all you want, but don't act like it doesn't say what it clearly says. It does say that.\n \n \n \n Then why are you arguing about this? Why are you taking issue if you have no problem with people saying it's their interpretation?\n \n \n \n In the sense that anyone could be wrong about anything, of course that is the case. You may be wrong too. As may I. That's part of taking a position and arguing. But based on years of Biblical historic and theological study, I conclude that the Bible probably does indicate a moralistic position that gay sex--particularly between two men--is a forbidden thing. To me, it's a debate that is, in a sense, disingenuous because it ignores the obvious, as if it's not the obvious. That the Bible forbids gay sex isn't even a serious question, IMO. Someone has to have quite an a agenda already to come to take this 2000 year-old agrarian text and try to make it NOT condemn gay sex any number of sexual activities that it frowns upon.\n \n \n \n That's all I'm saying to you. I'm pointing out that the very thing you are accusing people of, you can apply to both sides. You too are looking at scripture through an ideological viewpoint. I think my position is much more born out by the text of the the scriptures themselves, because mine has the benefit of actually acknowledging what says. :)\n\n \n The interpretation of the Bible that may be \"obvious\" to you is not \"obvious\" to all Christians or to all Bible scholars. There are scholars who argue that the passages that appear to condemn \"gay sex\" do not actually mean this. There are scholars who argue that the Bible does not refer to \"gay sex\" at all. There are scholars who take issue with the translations of the Bible that make it sound as though it condemns \"gay sex.\" I am not a Bible scholar, and I am simply pointing out that what seems \"obvious\" to you and to many other Christians is not \"obvious\" to all Christians. This is why many Lutherans do not view same-sex committed relationships as sinful. There is no consensus among Christians on what you think the Bible \"clearly says.\" \n \n I do not take an \"anything but gay\" approach to Bible interpretation. I do not interpret the Bible at all, as I said, because I am not a Bible scholar. I cannot read the original languages, and I do not know enough about the context in which the Bible was written to claim to know what the writers of the various books meant. I can do a far better job interpreting what the framers of the constitution meant! I am simply pointing out here that many Bible scholars and Christians do not interpret the Bible as you do. Since I am not a Christian, and I do not view the Bible as the word of God or as authoritative, I do not worry about what it \"means\" or what it \"really says.\" I find the debates over Biblical interpretation to be interesting, and I like to read about the non-canonical Gospels, the Gospel of James and others discovered in the twentieth century. But I am no scholar in this area, and I don't claim to be. \n \n I have argued that you appear to be interpreting the Bible through a biased lens, through a lens that reflects pre-existing prejudices and beliefs about \"morality\" and specifically about same-sex relations. You have argued that people who do not interpret the Bible as you do are doing the same thing: that they are interpreting the Bible through a biased lens, a lens that reflect pre-existing beliefs and specifically a wish not to see same-sex relations as sinful. I think that probably all people who adhere to the Bible as scripture probably interpret it through a biased lens, through a lens that reflect their pre-existing beliefs and prejudices. We see \"through a glass darkly,\" to quote the Bible itself. We do not see things necessarily as they are, but we see them as we are, to paraphrase Anais Nin. \n \n As to why we are arguing about this, it goes back to Easyrider's claim that he has the \"truth.\" Several of us then questioned his claim to the \"truth.\" My argument to him is that we all see truth from different angles, and all of our understandings of truth are partial and distorted and shaped by who we are.",

   "I think that the different ways of interpreting the Bible explain how Lutherans could vote to sanction pastors in same-sex committed partnerships to serve in the church. This is, of course, an internal debate among Lutherans. I was raised Lutheran, but this is no longer my faith. I am thus an outsider to this argument within the church. The same is true of the Episcopalians and other Christian denominations. It's really not my business, though I observe the church controversies with interest. \n \n The laws we enact in the civil society are the business of all of us. This is why many liberal Christians and non-Christians get concerned when conservative Christians try to enact their religious doctrines into law. I am sure conservative Christians feel the same way about religious liberals trying to enact our beliefs into law. This is a tricky issue, though. Many of the tenets of the various religions are broadly shared across the wider society. We all agree, I think, that murder is wrong, that it harms society, that it should be against the law, and that it should be punished severely. Whether murderers in certain circumstances should be put to death is a more divisive issue, and people of different faiths hold different views of this. \n \n Part of having freedom of religion is accepting that people will act out of their faith to try to shape the course of the wider society. There are Christians who work against the death penalty out of their religious beliefs. They are joined by others who work against the death penalty out of secular beliefs. The difficult question is when a law that is passed represents the narrow religious views of certain faiths, thus imposing adherence to particular religious doctrines on everyone. This is not an easy question to sort out. The Supreme Court has developed yet another one of those tests, the 3-part Lemon test, to determine when a law passed by a legislature or a public referendum violates the establishment clause of the first amendment. I don't know that anyone is entirely satisfied with the Lemon test, but it's what the Supreme Court uses. \n \n Some people say that churches should be barred from social activism entirely, as part of the separation of church and state. But such a bar would run afoul of the free exercise clause of the first amendment and probably also deny people the right of free speech. We in our church are active in working to pass legislation, and so we do the same thing that the conservative churches do in this regard. We just work for different laws, usually. \n \n This is not an easily resolved question of whether the majority voting in a law out of religious convictions is then violating the religious freedom of everyone else and creating an establishment of religion. There is no simple answer, in my view. I think the Lemon test is thus about the best the Court can do.",

In Matthew 7:5 he says, \"You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brothers eye.\"\n \n God acknowledges the legitimacy of civil authorities to judge: \n \n Romans 13:1-4: \"Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. (v. 4) For he (the reigning authority) is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of God's wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.\" (Also note Matthew 5:25; Acts 25:10-11)\n \n God has commanded the church to make correct judgments:\n \n John 7:24: \"Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment.\"\n \n Matthew 18:15-17: \"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses (note Deuteronomy 19:15). If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector .\"\n \n God commands us to judge according to one's 'fruits.'\n \n Matthew 7:17-20: \"Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.....every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.\"\n \n Saints of Christ will judge the world, and angels:\n \n I Corinthians 6:2: \"Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?\"\n \n I Corinthians 6:3: \"Do you not know that we will judge angels?\"\n \n Jesus condemned the teachers of the law and the Pharisees:\n \n Matthew 23:27-28: \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.\"\n \n John the Baptist rebukes King Herod for adultery and other sins:\n \n Luke 3:19: \"But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other things he had done, Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.\" \n \n Stephen rebukes the Jewish leaders:\n \n Acts 7:51-53: \"You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit!  Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him - you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.\" \n \n Also note all the Old Testament prophets who condemned sin and corrupt moral leadership, and who were persecuted for their discernment and duty.\n \n Finally, when someone (like Ohioprof) accuses you of being judgmental, are they not being critical and judgmental in making that accusation? \n \n Jesus is the Way and the TRUTH and the Life (John 14:6).",

The Gospel of John contains stories and statements that are absent from the three synoptic Gospels and from the non-canonical Gospels (like the Gospel of Thomas). The Gospel of John emphasizes the divinity of Jesus as the others do not, and it quotes Jesus as making claims for his divinity, whereas the other Gospels do not.\n \n Again, I am not a Bible scholar.

   "Easyrider's quotation from Robert Jastrow about meeting theologians has been endlessly quoted by conservative Christian writers who argue that science can prove the existence of God, or that science at least points to the existence of God. The argument of these conservative Christian writers is that the Big Bang and the second law of thermodynamics prove or indicate that God has to exist. The fact that the universe started and the fact that the universe is running down show that the universe is not eternal, they argue. Since the universe is not eternal, it had to have been created. \n \n The argument that the universe had to have been created seems like a leap to me that is not necessarily true. These folks argue that the universe could not have created itself out of nothing, and therefore there had to be a creator. Maybe, but maybe not. It strikes me that our knowledge of the start of the universe is too limited for us to leap to conclusions about a creator, and people are just wishing for there to have been a creator. Wishful thinking does not make what we wish true. \n \n I personally believe in God, but I do not think that arguing that someone must have created the universe gets us to God. It's just an argument for what people want to believe. I personally believe in God, but I think that our rational understanding is too limited for us to grasp the whole of God, the whole of truth. We cannot, in our human condition, understand God or the truth fully. God is deeper and more profound than we in our human reason can conceptualize. This is one reason I reject theological doctrine. Doctrine is just our limited human attempt to explain God in terms we can understand. Because doctrine is limited, it is never the whole of truth. Arguments that my doctrine is truer than your doctrine or that I have the truth and you don't are pointless and silly, I think. Theological doctrine may point to God and to the truth, but it is not the truth itself. I think the same can be said of science. Science is a process for discovering and a language for explaining pieces of the truth, but it is not the truth itself. Both science and theology are limited by our human conception of reality. That's okay. We do our best to conceive of truth, to point to it. I think we must never make the mistake of thinking that we have hold of the whole of truth.",

   "As I mentioned earlier, the story of the adulteress and the statement attributed to Jesus, \"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone,\" appears only in the Gospel of John. This story and this statement attributed to Jesus do not appear in any of the synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke). There is serious question among Bible scholars about whether Jesus ever said this.\n\n \n It's not a serious question to me. It's there and he said it. The earliest known manuscripts have it.\n \n \nThe Gospel of John differs significantly from the three synoptic Gospels. Scholars have debated who wrote the Gospel of John and to what extent the statements attributed to Jesus in the Gospel of John may have been his actual words. The three synoptic Gospels contain similar stories and descriptions of events that are absent from the Gospel of John. The Gospel of John contains stories and statements that are absent from the three synoptic Gospels and from the non-canonical Gospels (like the Gospel of Thomas). \n\n \n That's because it's the last of the Gospels and John evidently already read what was in the others. So, rather than be overly redundant, he wrote what he did.\n \n \n\n The Gospel of John emphasizes the divinity of Jesus as the others do not, and it quotes Jesus as making claims for his divinity, whereas the other Gospels do not.\n\n \n You're correct to a degree - that John emphasizes the deity of Jesus more than the other Gospels, but the divinity of Jesus is apparent in all four Gospels. Pick one if you think not and I'll show you.\n \n \nI do find the scholarship interesting, especially the theory that there was another lost Gospel, the Q Gospel, that was the source for the synoptic Gospels.\n\n \n Q doesn't pan out. There's too many problems with it. Besides, it's superfluous.\n \n Here's what's wrong with Q:\n \n Ten Reasons to Question Q\n \n This is an overview of grounds for scepsis about Q. These ten points are intended to function not as self-contained, knock-down objections but rather, when taken together, to encourage some critical questioning of the Q hypothesis. \n \n 1. No-one has ever seen Q\n Current literature on Q abounds with editions of Q, investigations into its strata, studies of the communities that were behind it and analyses of their theology. In such circumstances, it is worth allowing ourselves the sober reminder that there is no manuscript of Q in existence. No-one has yet found even a fragment of Q. \n \n 2. No-one had ever heard of Q\n No ancient author appears to have been aware of the existence of Q. One will search in vain for a single reference to it in ancient literature. For a while it was thought that 'the logia' to which Papias referred might be Q. Indeed, this was one of the planks on which the Q hypothesis rested in the nineteenth century. But no reputable scholar now believes this. \n \n More reasons in the link below:\n The Case Against Q: Ten Reasons\n \n Fallacies at the Heart of Q \n \n This is an introduction to some fallacies that cause Q to be more popular than it might otherwise have been. Five common viewpoints at the heart of the acceptance of Q will be stated and I will then attempt to explain why each of them is fallacious. This is an introduction to the relevant issues -- fuller exposition is available in \"A Monopoly on Marcan Priority? Fallacies at the Heart of Q\", Society of Biblical Literature Seminar Papers 2000 (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2000), pp. 538-622 (reproduced on this site -- click on the title). \n \n More in the following link: The Case Against Q: Fallacies at the Heart of Q\n \n Frequently Asked Questions on \n the Case Against Q \n \n The Case Against Q FAQ",

   "To Easyrider: The problem with your claim that the Bible contains accurate prophecies is that this claim breaks down upon close inspection. If we go to the link you provided on the accuracy of Bible prophecy, we see that the author claims that Psalm 22, verses 12-18 accurately prophesied the crucifixion of Jesus 1000 years before Jesus' death. Other Christian writers have claimed likewise. But is this true? Let's look.\n \n The Christian translations of these verses from the Hebrew do make it appear that they are about the crucifixion of Jesus, specifically because of verse 16 in the Christian versions of the Bible. The King James Bible's translation of verse 16 reads as follows: \n \n \"Dogs have surrounded me; a band of evil men has encircled me, they have pierced my hands and my feet.\"\n \n The reference to the piercing of hands and feet is common to Christian Bible translations of the original Hebrew, making it look as though the psalm may be prophesying the crucifixion of Jesus. \n \n However, if we go to a Jewish translation of the original Hebrew, we see that this verse looks quite different. The Jewish Publication Society translation of this verse from Psalm 22 reads as follows:\n \n \"For dogs have encompassed me; a company of evil-doers have inclosed me; like a lion, they are at my hands and my feet.\"\n \n There is no reference here to any piercing of hands and feet. The word \"pierced\" is not in the original Hebrew. The Christian translations leave out the word \"lion\" that is in the original Hebrew. \n \n This difference of translation has led to fervent disputes between Christians and Jews over who has translated the original Hebrew correctly. The explanation that seems most plausible to me is that Jewish translations of the Hebrew are correct, and Christians have inserted the word \"pierced\" into the text to try to make it appear to prophesy the crucifixion of Jesus. \n \n It sounds to me like Christians have mis-translated this verse of the Hebrew scriptures to try to make the Bible appear to support what they believe.",

Here's why. In Hebrew, the phrase \"they have pierced\" is kaaru while \"like a lion\" is kaari. The words are identical except that \"pierced\" ends with the Hebrew letter vav and \"lion\" with yod. Vav and yod are similar in form, and a scribe might easily have changed the text by inscribing a yod and failing to attach a vertical descending line so that it would become a vav. The evidence suggests that this may be what happened, since the Greek version of the Scriptures, known as the Septuagint, rendered in Egypt before the time of Jesus, preserves the reading of \"pierced.\" \n \n In Psalm 22:16 is \"they pierced\" a Christian mistranslation? - http://www.jewsforjesus.org/answers/prophecy/pierced/\n \n Did Christians invent \"they pierced my hands and my feet\"?\n \n The evidence in favor of \"pierced\" can be stated as follows: \n \n a. Its occurrence in the LXX (in the context of a faulty MT reading) is its strongest argument, and would normally be decisive. The LXX (esp. the kaige, proto-Theodotian that we find in the DSS) would represent earlier readings/understandings than A/S/J, and therefore be stronger evidence. \n b. The underlying word for 'pierced' (kara/h I--\"to dig\") is a widely attested root, and is used by the Psalmist in the sense of 'piercing' in Psalm 40:7/6, where the form is karitha (2ms ending). On the other hand, the alleged root for \"tie\" (kara/h IV) does NOT occur in biblical Hebrew anywhere or even in later rabbinic lit! (See Jastrow, DTX:666). If the textual variants listed above (in the MT family and Qumran) meant \"to tie,\" then they would therefore be unique in all of Hebrew literature, and contrary to all the linguistic data we do have! This is a very, very strong piece of evidence in favor of a 'pierced' reading over against a 'tie' reading. \n \n c. There are 28 passages (in the NAS) in which the English word \"pierced\" occurs. These are scattered across 15 different Hebrew words, with no single root accounting for more that 17% of the incidences (see unlabeled pie chart of distribution below). This means that kara was as good a choice as any other word to express \"pierced\". \n \n more reasons in the link.\n \n Did the Christians invent the \"pierced\" thing in Ps 22.17c?\n \n &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.According to Rashi, the meaning is &#8220;as though they are crushed in a lion&#8217;s mouth.&#8221; While the commentary of Metsudat David states, &#8220;They crush my hands and my feet as the lion which crushes the bones of the prey in its mouth.&#8221; Thus, the imagery is clear; These lions are not licking the psalmist&#8217;s feet! They are tearing and ripping at them. Given the metaphorical language of the surrounding verses (cf. vv. 12-21 [13-22]), this vivid image of mauling lions graphically conveys the great physical agony of the sufferer&#8230;&#8230;.\n \n &#8230;Where did the King James translators come up with this idea of &#8216;piercing&#8217; the hands and feet? That&#8217;s not what the Hebrew says.&#8221; &#8230;..\n \n &#8230;..Actually, the Septuagint, the oldest existing Jewish translation of the Tanakh, was the first to translate the Hebrew as &#8220;they pierced my hands and feet&#8221; (using the verb oruxan in Greek), followed by the Syriach Peshitta version two or three centuries later (rendering with baz&#8217;u) not only so, but the oldest Hebrew copy of the Psalms we possess (from the Dead Sea Scrolls, dating to the century before Yeshua) reads the verb in this verse as ka&#8217;aru (not ka&#8217;ari, &#8220;like a lion&#8221;), a reading also found in about a dozen medieval Masoretic manuscripts&#8212;recognized as the authoritative texts in traditional Jewish thought&#8212;where instead of ka&#8217;ari (found in almost all other Masoretic manuscripts) the texts say either ka&#8217;aru or karu.\n In conclusion, the Dead Sea scrolls agrees with the picture of the pierced Messiah in the 22nd Psalm, verse 16.\n \n http://www.truthnet.org/TheMessiah/12_Messiah_Objections_Psalms_2_22/",

   "There is no reference here to any piercing of hands and feet. The word \"pierced\" is not in the original Hebrew. The Christian translations leave out the word \"lion\" that is in the original Hebrew. \n This difference of translation has led to fervent disputes between Christians and Jews over who has translated the original Hebrew correctly. The explanation that seems most plausible to me is that Jewish translations of the Hebrew are correct, and Christians have inserted the word \"pierced\" into the text to try to make it appear to prophesy the crucifixion of Jesus.\n\n \n As someone who has studied this topic very in-depth, I can most assuredly tell you that you are incorrect on this from the standpoint of both text dating and textual criticism.

They want Psalm 22 to prophesy the crucifixion, and so they read it in a way that suggests it is about the crucifixion. The very fact that Jewish scholars do not read the psalm this way shows that the psalm is not clearly about the crucifixion, and it's simply how many Christian apologists choose to interpret it. They have an agenda here, obviously, and they read the text through the lens of their own bias, which is to believe that the text is prophecy.\n \n I do not find the arguments of Christian apologists to have much, if any, credibility.

   "Easy, I just realized that our arguing about Christian theology in this forum is probably not appropriate or useful. We are roaming farther and farther off topic, I fear. Plus, it's not a concern of mine who Jesus was, though it is an interesting question. But for you the questions about who Jesus was and what the Bible says are of greater significance than they are for me. I am not a Christian, and arguments about the Bible are just intellectual exercises for me. The Bible is central to your faith, and it is not central to mine. \n \n In the hope of my not sounding dismissive of your faith, I should probably bow out of this discussion. You are not going to persuade me to believe in your faith or in the claims of Christian apologists, and I am not going to persuade you to question or be skeptical of the claims of Christian apologists. I don't know that continuing with theological arguments will do either of us any good. \n \n My father used to advise me not to argue with Christians about their religious beliefs and then maybe they would leave me alone. He was right that I do not want to be proslytized at by Christians or by people of any faith. I am not going to believe what you believe no matter how hard you try to convince me.

I therefore do not pit my doctrine against yours; I do not adhere to theological doctrine at all. \n \n As for Thomas Jefferson, I think there was much that he believed that was of enormous significance for our nation and the world, and much that he thought that was wrong. I don't care about his views of sodomy; that's of no significance to me. He opposed industrialization and argued that we should have an agrarian republic. Alexander Hamilton, his opponent on many issues, argued that we should indutrialize and grow the republic and become rich. Jefferson opposed a strong central government and argued for states' rights. Hamilton argued that the young republic needed a strong central government to grow successfully and to industrialize. In the long run, Hamilton's vision turned out to be much closer to the republic we created than Jefferson's vision. We are in many respects a Hamiltonian republic today, not a Jeffersonian one, and I think we are better for it. \n \n Jefferson believed that God does not intervene directly in the affairs of the world. He was a Deist who believed that God created natural laws and let the world run according to those laws. He did not believe in Biblical miracles. He apparently did not believe in the resurrection. He omitted both miracles and the resurrection from his Jefferson Bible. \n \n My faith is closer to that of Jefferson than that of evangelical Christians.

   "\n \n Jefferson believed that God does not intervene directly in the affairs of the world. He was a Deist who believed that God created natural laws and let the world run according to those laws.\n\n \n That view of Jefferson is not accurate, and I'll prove it to you.\n \n A true deist in that day was one who believed God created the universe and then sat back and (1) did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations and, (2) did not give (divine) revelation to man. I think we can agree on that.\n \n Now, Thomas Jefferson:\n \n Thomas Jefferson was hardly speaking from a strict deist standpoint when he said: \n \n \"Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have \n removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the\n people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are\n not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my\n country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice\n cannot sleep forever.\" (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781)\n \n Now, why should Jefferson tremble for his country if God does not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations?\n \n Ant then there's this:\n \n \"I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we\n are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their\n native land and planted them in a country flowing with all\n the necessities and comforts of life.\" (Monday, March 4,\n 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address)\n \n Remember, a strict deist was one who believed God was like a watchmaker, who wound up the universe and thereafter did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. Jefferson obviously believed otherwise. If God led Israel into a new country, as Jefferson says, then he did intervene in the affairs of men and nations.\n \n It's obvious that Jefferson was not a true deist. He was a Unitarian, if anything.\n \n Would you agree from his own words that he was not a true deist?\n \n I can show you the same sorts of things on Franklin and Washington.\n \n \n He did not believe in Biblical miracles. He apparently did not believe in the resurrection. He omitted both miracles and the resurrection from his Jefferson Bible. \n\n \n Like I said, Jefferson believed in a supernatural God who led Israel into the promised land. He believed in a supernatural God who could save people from violence, discord, confusion, evil, and pride. And a God who could rain down wrath on the people when they got out of line. Sounds like a miracle worker to me.\n \n And I believe he wrote the following:\n \n \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\"\n \n Would you consider creation a miracle? I certainly would. \n \n Which is harder for God - to create man or raise him from the dead? About even, wouldn't you say?\n \n Thus, Jefferson believed in miracles, and he was schizophrenic to think that the resurrection of Jesus Christ was any more difficult than creating man in the first place.\n \n As far as the Jeffersonian Bible, Jefferson was doing a work on ethics, not creating his own set of beliefs on miracles, etc.\n \n Personally, I don't think theology was Jefferson's strong suit.",
