   "A colleague of mine at work is also an ordained minister. For a while he's been putting out emailed sermons and, knowing I have an interest in matters of faith, despite being strongly Atheist, he has been copying me in to these. Whilst I usually have mixed reactions to what he says, the last one contained section that I took umbrage to, namely:\n \n \n already out on a limb with my pro-Israeli comments (above) so I may as well also lend support for President George W. Bush as well. On the 7th August 2006, he said: \n \n \"It is the great challenge of this century and it's this: As young democracies flourish, terrorists try to stop their progress. And it's the great challenge of the United States and others who are blessed with living in free countries. Not only do terrorists try to stop the advance of democracy through killing innocent people within those countries, they also try to shape the will of the western world by killing innocent westerners. They try to spread their jihadist message -- a message I call, it's totalitarian in nature -- Islamic radicalism, Islamic fascism, they try to spread it as well by taking the attack to those of us who love freedom.\" Source: http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/08/20060807.html (White house source)\n \n Plain speaking - and in my view, it needed to be said! In this instance, he did not call the Moslem people Islamic fascists; he was referring to the jihadist message (which is a part of Islamic faith) promoted by extremists. (I am aware he has used similar language on I believe 2 other occasions - I'm limiting my comment to this verifiable source). It is time we become clear on the threat we are facing, and in that respect, I am glad that Mr. Bush made these remarks. Some of us in Britain have been so back-peddling this that my support may come as a jolt of electricity to some of you reading this. I will qualify it only by re-affirming that which is known by those who know me personally - that we love the Islamic people and work with them every way we can. Most of all, we desire them to come lovingly to the arms of Jesus, who is mighty to save.\n \n However, as a religious system of belief, let's not ignore the clear facts that Islam is founded upon principles of violent conflict that originated with the practices of Mohamed himself, so \"extremism\" is at the core of its faith. Yes, Christianity has much to be repented of; the Crusades; the Great Inquisition, etc., but there is a significant difference: these were aberrations to the true faith -- this is not the faith that Jesus taught or practiced. \n \n In Britain, I'm glad we still have some freedom of speech, and therefore I am thankful that I am aloud to speak my perceptions on this matter. I've stayed silent too long. I will still be tolerant, caring and supportive toward all. Andf this is but my personal opinion. I trust you find it helpful - even if you disagree! (Your personal comments and replies are welcome - these are my personal views only.)\n\n \n I've included the entire section to give some context, but it was mostly the penultimate passage I objected to. I've never responded to any of his emails before, mostly because I don't really want to start a religious slagging match. But I felt that I had to respond to this, so replied:\n \n \n...I can't agree with is the element that Islam is \"founded upon principles of violent conflict\". It is certainly true that Mohammed was a tribal leader, and as such lead his tribe into various skirmishes and conflicts. Violence was an aspect of his life but that was part of the nature of the society he lived in. Discounting violence perpetrated in the name of the religion afterwards (as you say the inquisition, crusades etc), the Bible also contains numerous instances in which acts of violence that would be totally unacceptable in today's society, but they are still elements described and condoned in the Bible. Jesus himself says \"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.\" (Matthew 10:34-36). \n \n Indeed the Bible does contain much that promotes peace, but so does the Qur'an. Essentially I see little difference between the two. Both were written several centuries in the past, during very barbaric times. It is unsurprising that elements of these times are reflected in them. I don't see this as giving them \"extremism... at the core of (the) faith\" for either religion, but instead that both have inherent elements that extremists have been able to manipulate. Extremism by very definition is something away from the general principles of something. Christianity is fortunate in that its extremists have not really been active recently, although the days of the KKK aren't too long ago. Islam is not currently so lucky...\n\n \n To which he replied:\n \n \nGood point, (Phunting)! I should have perhaps used the word \"fundamentalism\" rather than \"extremism\"! Thank you for your comments in any case!\n\n \n Anyway, this struck me as something of a cop-out. I think my point is still valid, no matter what semantics are used. I also didn't go so far as to say so to him, but I do feel that the comments and attitude of his in the first place is exactly the problem we have with inter-religious relations these days. People are too keen to decry the 'heathens' and bring everyone round to their way of thinking than actually understand each other's point of view.\n \n So, a convoluted first post to the thread, but as I wasn't able to get a decent debate out of my colleague on the issue, I hoped someone here would add their comments.",

Just making flippant statements like \"it's a religion based on violence\". That does nothingcome to help anyone but stir up misconceptions and unrest.\n\n \n Well, first we need to be very careful here and note that even in Islam, it is the fundamentalist factions that engage in violence, not Islam as a whole. But based on events these days, it's pretty hard not to with the impression that Islamic fundamentalism promotes violence. And it seems to be that the fundamentalism on Islam can be violent, while I've rarely ever heard of fundamentalist Christianity engaging in violence. The only possible exception that I can think of is the rare cases where an abortion doctor has been shot or a clinic bombed. But these are few and far between in comparison to what we see in fundamentalist Islam. This not just blindly accusing Islam of violence; it's noting the evidence of events in modern times. There are real reasons why Islam has a reputation for being violent . . . it's because too many times in modern times it HAS been violent and continues to be sometimes. \n \n One thing is certain . . . IF Islam teaches forgiveness rather than violent revenge, fundamentalist Islamics don't seem too interested in obeying that tenet. That's not to say many Christians don't also fail to live up to Christian teaching, but the fact is I've never heard of a Christian kidnapping people to kill them in the name of Jesus, or walking into crowded marketplaces and setting off body-strapped explosives killing men, women, and children in the name of Jesus. That's simply the reality of the situation, and I see no reason to pretend that's not the case just because it happens to be politically correct these days to point out problems in Christianity.\n \n Here's the bottom line though . . . the problem isn't Islam necessarily, OR Christianity. The problem is fundamentalism, and it's tendency to take things too far. Any ideology, taken to an extreme form of fundamentalism, could lead to violence. It's not because of religion, per se.",

   "The context of this passage (Matt 10:34) can be easily obtained by reading the verses around it:\n \n \n10:33 But whosoever shall deny (5667) me before men, him will I also deny (5695) before my Father which is in heaven. \n\n \n \n and also \n \n10:37 He that loveth (5723) father or mother more than me is (5748) not worthy of me: and he that loveth (5723) son or daughter more than me is (5748) not worthy of me. \n\n \n \n \n Feel free to peruse the rest of the passage, but these two make the point of the entire passage. It is not about violence or war as some would post. Instead it is about choosing christ or not. Jesus is saying, simply, that people choosing to follow Him will lead to division even in a man's own family. The point He is making is the same point that was made when He said:\n \n \n\n Mt 6:24 No man can (5736) serve (5721) two masters: for either he will hate (5692) the one, and love (5692) the other; or else he will hold (5695) to the one, and despise (5692) the other. Ye cannot * (5736) serve (5721) God and mammon. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n The question of whether Jesus' use of the sword is literal or metaphorical has resulted in this response which is to me as abhorrent as any physical violence. In order to avoid the problem of reading the words with their apparent simple meaning that Christianity must aggressively spread its message--at the point of the blood-soaked sword if necessary--an apologist must build a construct which seeks to deflect the blunt words into something else.\n \n That something else in this case is more dear than death itself, one's family. One must choose to go with Jesus or choose one's family. It is not that separation and division may occur in some instances, it is they will occur if one is properly following Jesus. I reject the commandment, and reject anyone who would utter such a contemptible thing. \n \n We can do nothing for Jesus. He is omnipotent. But we can do things for our families right here and now which will improve their lives and make significant improvements in their quality of life. They should be at the top of everyone's priorities. \n \n What should we think of a man who puts his needs first, to concern himself foremost with his scrawny soul in the next life, at the expense of his family in this life? Allow me to answer that: We should expose him for what he is--greedy and self-centered. And it will do no good to pile further apologia on top of these mean-spirited passages; Jesus firmly slams the door on any attempts to wiggle out. It is me or them, he states. If you love them more than me, you'll be very sorry. \n \n People are fond of saying their priorities are this: God, family, and country; in that order.

It is like the person who says \"The bible even says there is no god\". The bible does say this. However when you put it in context it actually says, \"A fool, in his heart, says there is no God.\" The two have drastically different plain meanings. To put things in context requires that one look at the original language from time to time as well. In my post, it is clear from the context of the passage that Jesus was not \"plainly\" saying that we should take up the sword. He was \"plainly saying\" exactly what I said.\n \n It is twisting things out of context that causes more violence than almost any other thing on the planet. \n \n EF",

You have a lot in here so let me respond to the best of my ability, but this is not an attempt to convert. Rather it is an attempt to provide a little more clarification.\n \n 1st, we cannot judge God by what humans do. Christians are not better people than anyone else. We are as damaged as the rest of the world. Jesus saying what he said is coming from the perspective that He is God. He is merely saying put God first in your life. My experience has taught me that doing so actually makes me a better lover of my wife and family. It is an odd paradox that making Him first actually makes your family the most important. Not sure I can be clear at this time on that.\n \n Tithing was around for a long long long time. It was instituted in the mosaic covenant in the book of Genesis. The israelites were to give 1/10 of their income to the tribe of Levi (the levite priests). Teh levite priests were to exist off of this money alone. They were not to take a job or do anything else and charge money for it. The giving of the people was to support them. That is the history of it. The early church may have screwed this up. My church does what the early church does. People give and that is what supports the staff. No one is coerced and we specifically ask visitors to NOT give because we consider it a family responsibility to support the family.\n \n Your assertions that these passages found their way into scripture after the fact is not supported by the actual facts. All of what Jesus spoke can also be found in the old testament.\n \n This is why context is so important and why I hate it when certain folks take the scripture out of context and simply make it say what they want. It is fine that you disagree with me. That is your God given right. My argument at this time is only with how it is interpreted. If you agree on my interpretation and just don't agree with it, fine. \n \n The metaphorical interpretation is the correct one. The singular idea that Jesus actually promoted killing and actually intended to go to war, does not jibe with the rest of scripture.\n \n For instance, in his \"triumphal entry\" into jerusalem, he comes riding on a donkey. This is significant. A conqueror came riding on a horse. A peaceful king came on a donkey. He was coming to sow peace not war. Those who misrepresent Him anger me at times (that church in kansas protesting war hero funerals for instance). They tick me off. It does not represent God. Not the loving God I know.\n \n EF",

The Crusades (for the most part) were a justified reaction to Muslim aggression.\n \n The Crusades get bad press but few acknowledge that they were a response to Muslim aggression. The first Crusade took place well over 400 years after the Muslims first began attacking Christian lands. \n \n The pre-history of the Crusades is significant. The 1st Crusade was called in part because the Fatimid caliph of Egypt destroyed the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and ordered the destruction of all Christian churches. The Muslim army had been aggressively attacking Christian lands for hundreds of years. The Christian lands of Syria, Iraq, the Byzantine Empire, and even as far as Spain and France had been attacked by Muslims. Islam had its origins in \"conversion\" by conquering with Mohammed. Christians had to respond.\n \n Look at this timeline if you have any doubts about the aggressive military endeavors of Islam. The attack on Christian lands by Muslims 400 years prior to the 1st Crusade wasn't the only event. It was the first in a series of events stretching over many, many years.\n \n http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/christian/blchron_xian_crusades01.htm?iam=metaresults&terms=%20prince+arslan",

   "Perhaps, but how did the Moors come to rule Spain???????????\nMy tribal kinsmen, the Berbers, started it in 711.\n \n http://www.sonhex.dk/under.htm\n \n \nSpain Under the Moors \n \n In 711 a Berber Muslim army, under their leader Tariq ibn-Ziyad, crossed the Strait of Gibraltar from northern Africa into the Iberian peninsula. Roderick, last of the Visigothic kings of Spain, was defeated at the Battle of R\u00edo Barbate. By 719 the invading forces were supreme from the coast to the Pyrenees. Their progress north was arrested at a battle fought in France, between Tours and Poitiers, in 732 by the Frankish ruler Charles Martel. The first years of their rule, the Moors, as the Berber conquerors came to be known, held the peninsula (except for Asturias and the Basque country) as a dependency of the Province of North Africa, a division of the caliphate of Damascus. After 717 the country was ruled by emirs, appointed by the caliphs, who were frequently neglectful of their duties; misrule resulted in the appointment and deposition of 20 successive emirs over the next 40 years. This state of affairs was ended by a struggle between the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties for control of the caliphate. The last of the Spanish emirs, Yusuf, favoured the Abbasids, but the local officials of the empire supported the Umayyads. The Umayyad faction invited Abd-ar-Rahman I, a member of the family, to become the independent ruler of Spain. In 756 Abd-ar-Rahman founded the powerful and independent emirate, which later developed into the caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba.\n \n During the establishment of Moorish power, a remnant of Christian rule was preserved in the northern portion of the peninsula. The most important Christian state of the northern peninsula, the small kingdom of Asturias, was founded about 718 by Pelayo, a Visigothic chieftain. Pelayo's son-in-law, Alfonso, conquered nearly all the region known as Galicia, recaptured most of Le\u00f3n, and was then crowned Alfonso I, king of Le\u00f3n and Asturias. Alfonso III greatly extended these territories during his reign, which ended in 910. During the 10th century the region of Navarre became an independent kingdom under Sancho I. As the kings of Le\u00f3n expanded their domains to the east in the early 10th century, they reached Burgos. Because of the castles built to guard the frontiers of newly acquired territory, this region became popularly known as Castilla, or Castile. Under Count Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez the region became independent of Le\u00f3n, and in 932 the Count declared himself the first king of Castile. In the 11th century a considerable part of Arag\u00f3n was captured from the Muslims by Sancho III, king of Navarre, who also conquered Le\u00f3n and Castile, and in 1033 he made his son, Ferdinand I, king of Castile. This temporary unity came to an end at Sancho's death, when his domains were divided among his sons. The most prominent of Sancho's sons was Ferdinand, who acquired Le\u00f3n in 1037, took the Moorish section of Galicia, and set up a vassal county in what is now northern Portugal. With northern Spain consolidated, Ferdinand, in 1056, proclaimed himself emperor of Spain (from the Latin Hispania), and he initiated the period of reconquest from the Muslims.\n",

The first Crusade took place well over 400 years after the Muslims first began attacking Christian lands. \n \n The pre-history of the Crusades is significant. The 1st Crusade was called in part because the Fatimid caliph of Egypt destroyed the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and ordered the destruction of all Christian churches. The Muslim army had been aggressively attacking Christian lands for hundreds of years. The Christian lands of Syria, Iraq, the Byzantine Empire, and even as far as Spain and France had been attacked by Muslims. Islam had its origins in \"conversion\" by conquering with Mohammed. Christians had to respond.\n \n Look at this timeline if you have any doubts about the aggressive military endeavors of Islam. The attack on Christian lands by Muslims 400 years prior to the 1st Crusade wasn't the only event. It was the first in a series of events stretching over many, many years.\n \n http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/christian/blchron_xian_crusades01.htm?iam=metaresults&terms=%20prince+arslan\n\n Are you really that far removed from reality? The Crusades weren't a defense against agression, they were an attack in themselves. Christians started the Crusades, not Muslims.\n And if you didn't realize it, the Christians lost the Crusades, so I don't know where you come off saying that if it weren't for the Crusades we'd be living in a Muslim world today\n The liberty of Christianity? Look, I'm not a church-basher by any stretch of the imagination, but it doesn't take that deep a look into history to see the oppression Christianity has taken part in.",

   "\n I agree with those standards. However, we do not know when examining the Bible much about the above parameters. We don't know who wrote it, or the motives for doing so. Also, miracles are problematic and require much higher standards. \n \n \n \n We have been butting heads basically over one verse in the NT. Jesus is purportedly instructing his listeners that serving two masters is impossible. I note that I have not purposely edited out any germane information previous to his proclamation. In other words, he does not say, \"Only a fool says you cannot serve two masters\". It is a very honest recreation of his alleged words. \n \n \n \n All you've provided is a comment that his directive allows you to love your family more, a clear violation of his admonishment. What allows you to do such a thing? Hermeneutics?\n \n [/LIST]\n\n \n First- The standards you agree with are the principles of hermaneutics. It is a fancy way of saying interpretation of ancient texts. So for someone who thinks hermaneutics is garbage you certainly agree with it.\n \n Second you did leave out information. You quote one verse but do not include the verses around it.\n \n Third, I did include the verses around it. Please see the post where I include in direct response to you the following:\n \n \nOriginally Posted by epaphras_faith \n The context of this passage (Matt 10:34) can be easily obtained by reading the verses around it:\n \n \n Quote:\n 10:33 But whosoever shall deny (5667) me before men, him will I also deny (5695) before my Father which is in heaven. \n \n \n \n and also \n \n Quote:\n 10:37 He that loveth (5723) father or mother more than me is (5748) not worthy of me: and he that loveth (5723) son or daughter more than me is (5748) not worthy of me. \n \n \n \n \n Feel free to peruse the rest of the passage, but these two make the point of the entire passage. It is not about violence or war as some would post. Instead it is about choosing christ or not. Jesus is saying, simply, that people choosing to follow Him will lead to division even in a man's own family. The point He is making is the same point that was made when He said:\n \n \n Quote:\n Mt 6:24 No man can (5736) serve (5721) two masters: for either he will hate (5692) the one, and love (5692) the other; or else he will hold (5695) to the one, and despise (5692) the other. Ye cannot * (5736) serve (5721) God and mammon. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n Note that you leave it out and I include it. I also go through the principles that you agree with and interpret rightly and you just argue that the plain meaning is what you say it is. \n \n You give no analysis. You do not include the context. You essentially do not debate. \n \n You reveal your prejudices this way.\n \n Your characterizations of your abilities fall clearly under the heading of \"in denial\"\n \n Give it up.

The larges evidence for this in this book is the crucifixion which Christ took willingly for the sins of the world. For those that hated him he took torture and death and humiliation. That is also part of the context which you neglect. However, I simply stated that the verse does not promote violence. That it was a metaphor to state that God must be first in one's life.
