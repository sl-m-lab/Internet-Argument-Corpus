Good analysis there. The question of whether N was our ancestor or just a cousin has long been under study. At times as you point out it was thought to be ancestral at others not. At no time was any of this seen to have an impact on evolutionary theory as such, nor was there any reason for it to do so. Its a question of the evolution of a specific species (ie ourselves and N) and not a question of evolutionary theory.\n \n As to modern Ns consider that they seem to have established themselves as spokesmen for a well known insurance company in modern times.

Wells...if the Neanderthal morphology changed into modern human morphology quickly, then that means non-evolutionary mechanisms were responsible. Just as an example, infant's bones are very soft and shapeable.....if the Neanderthals were indeed early humans and thus long-lived (as stated in the Bible) then we can possibly assume that they matured at later times. Kids nowdays are starting to mature earlier and earlier. But if this trend is extrapolated backwards in time thousands of years, we can assume that maybe instead of puberty happening between the ages of 12-14, it may have happened between the ages of 18-25...(just a guess). If this were the case, the Neanderthals' would have grown at a slower rate and their bones would have been soft and shapeable for longer periods of time. Given this, if these people were to have eaten a diet heavy in meat, this might have given them their heavy brows over their eyes...(used as resistance in chewing). However, as agriculture was introduced and diets changed..(leaning more towards breads and grains) not only might it have effected lifespan, but also morphology. \n \n The idea that diet can change morphology, specifically skull shape, is not new. There is also a trend in the human race for smaller, more rounded heads.\n \n http://english.people.com.cn/200608/17/eng20060817_294183.html\n \n Dr. Wu Xue Jie from the IVPP said experts in the research team tested, analyzed and compared 718 skulls belonging to Chinese adult males who lived during the New Stone Age, the Bronze Age and modern times. They discovered that Chinese people's craniums and viscerocraniums are getting smaller; their noses and eye sockets are becoming narrower; and their skulls are becoming more rounded. \n \n I can also show you how a diet high in sugar and starches causes the brain to shrink and alter skull shape in other various ways.\n \n Evolutionists, however, say that morpholgy changed because of random mutations and natural selection. But like I said before, there is not enough time represented in the fossil record for RMNS to take place...(not to mention no real reason why these physical changes would make them better breeders.) This is why Neanderthals have been called a different species and have been killed off without giving rise to modern humans.\n \n doubt me that they're called a different species?\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3431609.stm\n \n The Neanderthals were not close relatives of modern humans and represent a single species quite distinct from our own, scientists say\n \n Yet you say they are the same species. Yet no one actually knows what a \"species\" is -- so it's all a big joke anyway.\n \n But the point is, if modern day humans really did descend from Neanderthals by experiencing just a simple change in morphology by way of environmental influences, it pretty much destroys the concept of human evolution. Homo erectus, the supposed ancestor to Neanderthals is shaped much like them -- so much like them that they've been called \"little Neanderthals.\" So Neanderthals and homo erectus are basically one in the same -- just different sized bodies and located in different parts of the world. The problem is, though, there is no \"evolution\" between them, and there is no \"evolution\" between them and us. We are all humans -- and there is no bridge -- including homo habilis -- to any other creature on earth.\n \n Not only that, but the kicker is, the timeline for morphological change must be shrunk to the extreme. We can assume, if the changes stemmed from environmental influences, that change took place not over hundreds of thousands of years, but over just a few generations. Oops....the concept of evolution is all starting to fall apart.\n \n There's a very good reason Neanderthals were said to have died off without giving rise to modern humans -- because the alternative kills ToE.",

I'm not doubting that some people have called them a different species. I said that their classification is controversial and has gone both ways, from the same species arguable to different species (but should probably go back to being the same species). The article that you cite takes pains to make the same point, contrary to what you imply by selective quoting. The rest of the article says things like:\n \n Others claim Neanderthals contributed significantly to the modern gene pool.\n \n ........ \n \n But Dr Ahern added that, while the Neanderthal specimens used in the study are all male, several of the early modern Europeans the authors compare them with are female skulls.\n \n .......\n \n But some researchers believe this does not exclude the possibility that interbreeding occurred. Dr Magnus Nordborg, of Lund University in Sweden, has calculated that even if Neanderthals had comprised 25% of the population after merging with modern humans, their DNA might be impossible to detect today. \n\n \n \n \n There's a very good reason Neanderthals were said to have died off without giving rise to modern humans -- because the alternative kills ToE. \n\n Whether neandertals are a 'breed apart' or not is of great interest, but the ToE is perfectly comfortable whichever way the facts turn out. Your claim is beyond stupid - if, as you say, \"science needs the Neanderthals be a different species\", how come so many evolutionary biologists held to the opposite conclusion for so long? This is not an area where the ToE predicts or needs a specific outcome.\n \n \n I can also show you how a diet high in sugar and starches causes the brain to shrink and alter skull shape in other various ways.\n Biologists have never disputed that phenotype reflects more than just genotype alone (if you've had nose surgery, you've altered your phenotype), although note that the changes you mention are neither genetic nor heritable, so they are not evolutionary. \n \n You continue to state, without evidence, that there is insufficient time for the changes to happen. A weight increase of 0.1% per generation could take a mouse-size creature to an elephant-size creature in 60,000 years. Compared to that, biologists have measured size changes of various body parts as high as 5-10% in a single generation (e.g., Grant with Geospiza). There are a lot of reasons why such a change is unlikely to happen so quickly over the long term, but it is sufficent to question your claim of insufficient time. Also, a small change in a regulatory gene can immediately have many diverse effects: look up what can happen during environmentally-induced neoteny, for instance, as an example of what could happen during neoteny induced by genetic mutations.",
