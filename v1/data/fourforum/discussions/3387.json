But, although you may not care, but since this whole argument is based around the Biblical view (i.e. of the author of this thread), God made it very clear that from the instant of conception, the fetus is considered human. So hence, when you are having an abortion, you are, in fact, as harsh as this may sound and I do apologise in advance, a child killer. You are killing your own flesh, so to speak. I must confess, that if a women was raped, I don't think that I could really say anything if she wanted an abortion. I really don't know about situations like this. I couldn't really object to it that loudly.\n \n So it is right and just that eternal life is dolled out not to those of worth, but only those who subjagate themselves for an intangible entities pleasure?\n \n No, eternal life is avaible to anyone and everyone.

The book's historical accuracy.\n 2. The book's scientific accuracy.\n 3. The book's prophetic accuracy.\n 4. The book's life-transforming message.\n \n The best way to illustrate this is to use the Bible, for example.\n 1. Nelson Glueck, famous Jewish archaeologist, spoke of what he called \"the almost incredibly accurate historical memory of the Bible, and particularly so when it is fortified by archaeolgical fact.\" William F. Albright, widely recognized as one of the great archaeologists, stated:\n \"The excessive scepticism shown toward the Bible by important historical schools of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, certain phases of which still appear periodically, has been progressively discredited Discover after discovery has established the accuracy of the Bible as a source of history\".\n \n 2. Some examples: that the Earth is round (Isa. 40:22); the Earth is suspended in space without support (Job 26:7); the hydrologic cycle; sea currents; living things reproduce after their kind; many insights in health, hygiene, diet, physiology (such as the importance of blood, e.g. Lev. 17:11); the first and second laws of thermodynamics (e.g. Isa. 51:6); the stars are countless (Gen. 15:5) - people of old thought that the stars could be counted - there were about 1200 visible stars. Ptolemy dogmatically stated that the number of stars was 1056.\n \n The fact that the Pleiades stars are travelling together, while the Orion stars are seperating. God speaking to Job in Job 38:31 says: \"Can you bind the beautiful Pleiades? Can you loose the chords of Orion?\" How would the people of the day have known this, remember, Orion and Pleiades would have looked the same every night back then. I can't tell that the Orion cluster is breaking up when I go out at night and do some star gazing.\n \n 3. One will search in vain for one line of accurate prophecy in other religious books, but the Bible contains many specific prophecies. Mc Dowell documents 61 prophecies regarding Jesus alone; many of these include His place, time and manner of birth, betrayal, manner of death, burial, etc., were beyond His control. McDowell also thoroughly documents 12 detailed, specific prophecies regarding Tyre, idon, Samaria, Babylon, Jerusalem, Palestine, and many others. He also shows how these were not \"post dictions\", or written after the event. The probability of all thse things coming by chance is effectively zero, only the wilfully ignorant (2 Peter 3:5) could deny this evidence that God must have inspired these prophecies.\n \n 4. In San Francisco, an agnostic once challenged Dr Harry Ironside to a debate on \"Agnosticism versus Christianity\". Dr Ironside agreed, on one condition: thtat the agnostic first provide evidecne taht agnosticism was beneficial enough to defend. Dr Ironside challenged the agnostic to bring one man who had been a \"down-and-outer\" (a drunkard, criminal, etc.) and one woman who had been trapped in a degraded life (such as prostitution), and show that both of these people had been rescued from their lives of degradation through embracing the philosophy of agnosticism. Dr Ironside undertook to bring 100 men and women to the debate who had been gloriously rescued through believing the Gospel the agnostic rediculed. The sceptic withdrew his challenge to debate Dr Ironside. The message of the Bible mends lives broken by sin, which seperates us from our holy Creator. In contrast, agnosticism and atheism, like all anti-God philosophies, destroy.\n \n The Bible has a few more characteristics:\n 5. The Bible's absolute honesty. The Bible does not honour man, but God. The people in the bible have feet of clay; they are shown \"warts and all\". Against the backdrop of their sinfulness and unfaithfulness, God's holiness and faithfulness shine through. Even the heroes of the faith have their failures recordered, including Noah, Moses, David, Elijah and Peter. On the other hand, the enemies of God's people are often praised, for example, Artaxerxes, Darius the Mede and Julius. If the Bible were written from a human perspective, the total opposite would happen. The enemies would be slandered, and the heroes praised. \n \n 6. The Bible's civilizing influence. The Bible's message elevated teh blood-drinking \"barbarians\" of the British Isles to decency. It foms the basis of English common law, the Americian Bill of Rights and the constitutions of many great democracies. Today the message of the Bible still transforms. Animistic tribal groups in the Philippines are today still being delivered from fear, ad former cannibals in papua New Guniea and Fiji now live in peace, all because of the Gospel.\n \n 7. The Bible's amazing preservation. In spite of political and religious persecution the Bible remains. The Roman Emperor Diocletian thought that he had destroyed every hated Bible. Twenty-five years later, teh new Emperor, Constantine, commissioned the production of 50 Bibles at the expense of the Government. By the 1800's, the noted French infidel, Volatire, forecasted that by the 1900's, there would be no Bibles left on Earrth. After he died, his old printing press was used to produce stacks of Bibles. The Bible is today available in far more languages than any oher book.\n \n 8. The Bible's amazing unity. Despite being penned by more than 40 authors from over 19 different walks of life over some 1,600 years, th Bible is a consistent revelation from the beginning to the end. Indeed the fist and last books of th Bible, Genesis and Revelation, dovetail so perfectly - telling of \"Paradise Lost\" and \"Paradise Regained\".\n \n 9. The Bible is also very different to other religions. Many people think that \"all religions are the same\" and/or \"there are many paths to God\", but it's very clear that Christianity is starkly different from all other religions. For one thing, Jesus Christ is a live Saviour-after having been raised from the dead, he appeared to over 500 eye-witnesses [1 Corinthians 15:6]-while the founders of other religions decayed in their tombs. So that is already very strong support for the uniqueness of Christianity/the Bible. Please see the article titled Holy books?  for more exciting information on why the Bible is different which points to it being of divine origin. This article compares books on things we can test, including geology, biology, etc.\n \n \n I believe Christianity because the evidence that I see in the world matches perfectly what the Bible has to say about our history, e.g. the Fossils and many land features (such as the Grand Canyon) could be easily explained by a lot of water over a relatively short time, i.e. Noah's Flood. The fact that the Bible contains all of the characteristics mentioned above, and no other Holy Book contains accurate prophetical statements, really convinces me that the Bible is the Word of God.\n \n Hello zachvac:\n No it doesn't. The point of the \"exercise\" is to ask would you accept whatever god told you or would you use common sense if the 2 contradicted. \n Okay then, hypothetically (although I don't like deal with them), no, I would not believe if He said that 1 + 1 = 3 because I would know from school and basic counting skills that it equals 2 or \"Window\". But here is the point, the Bible contains no such lines where common sense is contradicted with what He says. I don't base my belief on blind faith, mine is a reasonable and defendable faith, i.e. Christianity.\n \n Right now I'm alive, \n \n Thank God, I was starting to get a little scared... I hope that you enjoy your life and live it to the fullest!\n \n But even you admit it isn't as simple as just deciding they want to be homosexual. \n \n In some cases, no. There are external factors such as the environment in which the child is brought up. But as for the last part of your statement, that'll be a new one on me! I ain't part homosexual. I also heard someone talking about a \"gay gene\". I highly, highly doubt that this is so. Shall we send an email to the scientists working on the human genome program and ask them if they have discovered such a gene. Otherwise, it is nothing more than a figment of our imaginations. I could always be wrong though...",

What measure do you put (?); how do you compare His voice to something so you can say \"Oh, yes, that's like God\"\n \n \nAbraham new the sound of His Gods voice....... And Abraham was quite prepared to sacrifice Isaac, his only son........ God was testing him, and he passed the test. God revealed Himself to Abraham, and Abraham new Him.\n\n There is no doubt Abraham knew. How did he know? Do you compare yourself to Abraham?\n \n \nIs it worse to disobey God fearing that you may be doing the devil's work or to give in to Satan's deceptions and blame God?\n\n This doesn't make sense. If you disobey God you are not working for Satan. If you mean to ask \"Is it worse to think you are working for God...etc\"\n \nWhile God may have been testing Isaac,\n\n Do you mean Abraham? Or are you referring to another incident?\n \nhis only follower for complete obedience is it not possible that he could test you now to see whether you hold onto the principles His son taught you to ensure that even with the Devil's lies you will remain pure. Even if you're wrong what is worse - disobeying God or breaking his laws to aid Satan?\n\n This again makes no sense. How are you aiding Satan when you obey God?\n \nAs long as the voices are not doing anything your conscience (or really the law, seeing as it is based in Christian values) tells you not too you should be fine,\n\n Simply put your conscience should allow anything God asks; because God's Will is good.\n \na God that forces his followers to do hateful acts or keeps contradicting his own divine laws is not worth your faith.\n\n This is not something God would do.\n \nYou know that God is, and that He would never order something that, presuming that you do follow the true spirit of His and Jesus' message, you find morally wrong.\n\n You can't do something morally wrong in the service of God.",
