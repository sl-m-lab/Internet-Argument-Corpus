By some counts, 75 percent of Haitians actively practice the ancient melding of West African spiritism and witchcraft. One common saying is that Haitians are 70 percent Catholic, 30 percent Protestant and 100 percent voodoo. \n \n Discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492, Haiti's tropical location and lush soil made it a treasure prized by Britain, France and Spain. By the middle of the 17th century, the island became a French colony. Producing abundant crops of cocoa, sugar cane, cotton and coffee, Haiti was one of the wealthiest places on Earth. Unfortunately, this wealth depended on the labor of 500,000 slaves. \n \n Desperate to be free, the slaves began to organize. On August 14, 1791, a black slave and witch doctor named Boukman led the slaves in a voodoo ritual. They sacrificed a pig and drank its blood to form a pact with the devil, agreeing to serve him for 200 years in exchange for freedom from the French. The slave rebellion began on Aug. 22, 1791, and after 13 years of conflict, the slaves won their independence. On Jan. 1, 1804 they declared Haiti the world's first independent black republic. \n \n Today in Port-au-Prince - Haiti's capital - you can see an iron pig statue.  Presidential Candidate Hopes to Reclaim Haiti for Christ\n \n\n \n \nJp I used to actually admire Robertson before discovering how horrible and wretched this man truly is. The reasoning behind people getting their knickers in a knot is simply because he is a powerhouse of the Christian right. The man makes millions off of people and is a charlatan.\n \n From making horrific untrue statements of LGBT people to his rantings against the stricken people of Haiti this man is disillusioned to the point of insanity. What is truly shocking is people follow him like sheep off a cliff. He even goes so far as to claim a son's mother can \"pray away\" the gay in her son and that he should seek therapy.\n \n This man clearly has a disdain for LGBT people and his narrow brooding thoughts in his mind against people of other cultures is now prevalent.

(AP) -Airplanes sent to Zaire by evangelist Pat Robertson's tax- exempt humanitarian organization were used almost exclusively for his diamond mining business, say two pilots who flew them.\n \n Three airplanes were flown to Zaire in September 1994 by Operation Blessing. However, chief pilot Robert Hinkle said only one or two of the roughly 40 flights during his six months in the country could be considered humanitarian. All the rest of the flights were mining-related, he told The (Norfolk) Virginia-Pilot.\n \n .... Robertson refused to be interviewed directly, the newspaper said in Sunday's editions. Calls to his office on Sunday were not answered.\n \n .... Robertson's company, African Development Co., based in the Zairian capital of Kinshasa, sought to dredge diamonds from a remote jungle riverbed.
