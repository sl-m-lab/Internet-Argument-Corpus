   "The Second Amendment Is Going Global. First Stop: England\n \n Posted by Jan Ireland\n Sunday, March 21, 2004 \n \n \n ~~o~~\n \n When British government officials took away all guns from law-abiding citizens in 1997, they said it was for a safer England. The preceding first step of gun registration--which they assured the public had nothing to do with a plan to confiscate all guns--had been couched as ''for safety.''\n \n Now guns in England are squarely in the hands of criminals. English citizens are subject to skyrocketing criminal assaults, and have no means to defend themselves in their homes or on the street. Guns have been criminalized, so only the criminals have guns. Seems the criminals didn't bother to obey the law, a fact that is always a complete surprise to gun control proponents.\n \n It's time the Second Amendment crossed the Pond, and that history-making event is at hand. Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms is opening a branch in England. And the committee's members likely won't stop there.\n \n CCRKBA is headed by Alan Gottlieb, a no-nonsense dynamo, who says ''Just as with America's war against international terrorism, we are taking the fight against international gun control to our enemies. With the attack on gun rights becoming global, it is important to fight these battles on every continent before we find ourselves isolated from an important human civil right.''\n \n Greg Smith, a young political science graduate and activist with the British Conservative Party, will head the English office. The office is to be funded by British citizens, as well as by gun owners in other European countries. Its mission is simple: To get back the right of self defense for the citizens of England.\n \n Ordinary citizens live the dangers that gun control imposes. They note the double standard that allows ''elites'' to carry guns, or have their children protected by armed bodyguards. They are forced to stand by as their property is taken. Women and young girls have no means to repel assaults.\n \n The people of the world have had enough--with the rise in terrorism, the rise again of anti-Semitism, the U.N.'s call for One World Disarmed (though that didn't keep Kofi Annan's bodyguards from having illegal weapons on the floor of our Senate), and all guns including water pistols and little boys' fingers a target for the extremist left.\n \n Ordinary citizens are, shall we say, up in arms. They are ''armed'' with the stellar, irrefutable research of John Lott and others, which meticulously details the increase in safety in communities where guns flourish. But most of all they are armed with common sense, which tells them that when criminals know that no one has guns--they strike.\n \n England, our staunch and strong ally which is so like us in so many ways, has a completely different history with guns. Monarchs and titled rulers had a need to keep the masses in line. Force, fear, punishment, and tradition kept guns out of the hands of ''commoners,'' and reserved them for the ''aristocracy.''\n \n But in America, all Men were created Equal. It's extraordinarily revealing to note the vital importance that our Founding Fathers attached to the right of self defense, ensconcing it in its own Second Amendment. Yet, citizens in present-day England have been arrested and sent to prison--simply for protecting their lives or property.\n \n Check history. Communists, Marxists, and despots of every stripe, all sought to disarm the people first. But the citizens of the world have had their fill of that.\n \n The Second Amendment is going global. First stop: England.\n \n Jan Ireland is a freelance writer and former teacher in Texas. She receives e-mail at: janirelandreplies@hotmail.com.",

   "English are welcomed to emigrate to other EU countries if they wish ;) .\n \n Serious:\n Don't you think that the ones who benefit most would be the criminals? I am not aware of British stats about crime but I don't think it is terribly worse than in my country and in that case you would make things worse for normal people.\n \n Please don't take this as a comment about US gun laws. I know that it is too late to ban guns in your country. Although there should still be some restrictions imo.",

   "From the data we have seen regarding crime trends in britian since the gun ban, the ONLY people who have benifited from that particular bit of legislation are the criminals. \n \n Crime in britain has been on a steady rise since the ban was passed. They are even considering arming their police officers now. It seems logical that reversing that particular bit of ill concieved legislation would benifit ONLY law abiding citizens. THe criminals apparently have not obeyed the ban, they simpley get their weapons through other outlets. Recently they have started convrting starting pistols. In America, a converted startign pistol would be a pretty poor choice for a weapon, there is good chance you would be laughed at. Apparently in Britain, people are being terroriz4d by them/",

   "Some restrictions? I thought there were restrictions. Otherwise I could go in, slap money on the counter and walk out of the gun shop with a full-auto minigun, no questions asked. Or do you think that's what happens here in the US?\n \n I think England is a lost cause to be honest. Whenever someone injures an intruder who intends to do them harm, on their own property, and gets sentenced to several years in prision while the criminal gets off free, something is seriously wrong with your society.",

   "This isn't the first time someone defending themself, either by firearm or other means, has been prosecuted and convicted by what would be dismissed as self-defense in the states. It's almost as if they have no property rights. Only place you'll find that happening around here is NY and CA. Maybe they'll kill each other out eventually.\n \n BTW, is that assumption or proof? I wouldn't mind some proof, at least then I would have some reason for hope over there. I know how it can be when self-defense (by firearms) isn't reported in the major media.",
