   "God knows everything. He knows what he will be doing next and what he will do after that and what he will do after that. He knows this, therefore he has no choice but to do what he knows will happen.\n \n If you agree with that then consider this. God created the world because he had to. He will end it because he has to and he knows when he will end it. Now this means if he knows when he will have to end it, that the end date is set and that there is absolutely nothing humans can do about it. This means we all have a destiny and cannot change it. It also means no matter what you do, your fate has already been pre-determined.\n \n So perhaps God is nothing but a robot who follows a set path. Humans are also robots who follow set paths but do not know where the path leads like God does.\n \n This also means that God probably has no free will since he has to follow his path. People can have free will since they have their free will lead them down the path that has already been set.\n \n The only major contradiction here would be could God escape his path if he is all-powerful or would being all knowing make him stay on his path?",

   "The question should be \"Is god like a robot\"\n \n * No, I'm actually implying that he could just as easily be a machine as a real thing. Like if we were in the Matrix, God would be the computer running it. But yeah, it can also be he could just be like a robot.\n \n - When you have a plan to swim across the pool, that is your plan but you always have a choice to stop or to simply get out of the pool. Obviously if god made a plan, this is what he wants to do. He has no reason to suddenly change his mind.\n \n * It wouldn't be like planning to him. People can only plan because they do not have any idea what will actually happen. God does know what will happen so to plan would be futile. Like if you knew the 49ers would beat the Jets 49 to 10, would you simply plan to put money on the 49ers or would you know you were going to? Probably not the best analogy but I'm just saying everything he does is already set into stone even if he hasn't done it yet. I'll talk more about this later in the post.\n \n - The \"theory\" of fate is not without free will. Fate simply tells what you're going to do. Are you going to get out of the pool or not. You still have the choice, but your choice is known. If you are to know your choice this is also part of fate. There is no loophole in this theory that I'm aware of.\n \n * I actually used to be perplexed how free will and fate can exist at once but I do understand it now and I did say that people can have free will and fate at the same time. However, people have free will before they have a fate if they both do exist. Their free will has to lead them down a certain path at the beginning of time and that becomes their fate. For instance, when existence began there was nothing. Then suddenly the future appeared for God to see and free will dictated to some extent how it would end. After free will was used to put everything into place, existence was truly set into motion with everything having the fate that was laid out by free will. Of course, this would mean that Gods plan didn't exist until free will had played out which is a little hard to believe since his plan would inevitably change what everything's fate was. So now comes an interesting question, did free will or Gods plan come first? If Gods plan came first, then he needed to align all fates in a way so they would follow his plan and that would eliminate free will. If free will came first, perhaps God would only modify the fate that was laid out before him. Being a perfect creature, he would be able to successfully integrate his plan into the fate that was created and be able to maintain most of the original free will that was used to create the fate. But now I'm rambling.\n \n - This is what god wants to do. It is his plan. We follow the path we are going to choose. Of course this depends on whether or not you think we are products of our environment.\n \n * One thing disturbing about this is that it means God made a plan where certain people would inevitably end up in Hell no matter what they did. This is to say, the decision had to be made who would get into heaven after they died and how they would be treated in heaven before he could finalize his plan. Now this is not to say that it is his fault, he had no choice but to do this. Since he already by this time was following his own fate, he had no choice but to pre-determine where everyone's sole would end up long before they even existed. And free will did initially lead God to make that decision and that certain person to their fate of either Heaven or Hell but at this point, there is nothing they can do to change this. Sort of depressing and you can't help but hope that God was good enough to make his plan include you in Heaven.\n \n - God created free will.... how can you say he does not have it? God knows what he is going to do. He knows if he is going to change his mind. Obviously he knows he's not.....\n That doesn't make much sense, but hopefully I got my point across.\n \n * Well this goes back to one of my earlier ramblings, if God did have free will then at the beginning of time, perhaps his free will created his fate and his plan was included by his own free will and eventually became his current fate assuming his life follows a linear path such as our own does. So perhaps he did at one time have free will, but he is now probably following his fate and since he is all knowing, he knows what his fate is and has no choice anymore but to follow it and therefore no longer has free will.\n \n Always Stay Open Minded\n \n * This little debate here really has nothing to do with whether I believe or not. Just trying to see if anyone else thinks my logic makes sense or if I'm off on something. Then again, perhaps this debate will lead to some sort of break through for me or someone reading it. Who knows what our alleged fate holds emoticon_confused\n \n I know this is either the most confusing post I ever wrote or the most insightful.

   "I agree that he is outside that room. I also agree we are inside that room. But what I'm asking for is what makes you think he isn't doing things in sequence in his own world? From everything you have ever seen him do in our world, it has all been done in sequence. So it can also be taken one step further and the assumption can be made that perhaps the sequence he follows is mirrored by our own 'time' dimension. Perhaps he is constrained by a version of time himself and the time he created for us is different or inferior to the time he follows.\n \n Well, instead of debating this, the only real question would be is there any place that would give us any idea as to whether God follows a sequence of events similar to ours? Does he need to start somewhere and end somewhere? From what I can see, he has always started somewhere and ended somewhere and acts in a sequential manner. Hence the idea that he would know what he is going to do next and be forced to do that.\n \n It is an interesting idea though, that he may not be constrained by anything at all. And no doubt it is nearly impossible to fathom how this could be since everything in our world is done sequentially.",

   "Well all powerful is contradicting in itself. To assume that he is all powerful is to assume he can make a square circle. And that is not being rediculous either. To be all powerful, he would have to be able to do anything, anywhere, no matter what the limitations were. And there are limitations on what a circle can be. That would include in our own world at least. It is also impossible that he could not overcome any limitations set by a certain world no matter what they are.\n \n So constraints are in place for even God at least using our own logic. Our logic would also dictate that things have to be done sequentially and I find it feasible that he may be constrained by that as well even if he is not constrained by time.\n \n Something similar to what your saying about him doing everything simultaniously would be this. A person could pause time and go do a million different things and then restart time and it would be as if he had done a million things at once. Yet still, even outside the constraint of time, he was forced to do things in a certain order. He could also travel through time, both backwards and forwards, and do things in the year 2000 first and do his final actions in the year 200 bc making it seem non-sequencial. But in reality, he would still have had to do everything sequentially.\n \n I think God is similar to this. Being all powerful is an impossibility as long as you assume God has not made this world in order to confuse us about him. I think that fact makes it impossible that he can both be non-deceiving and be all powerful at the same time. For if the rules of this world are only in place to make him seem powerful or make it impossible for us to understand him, the same being who somehow our creation was based on, then he would be deceiving us at least in my view.\n \n I also have a problem with God being all knowing. If he really is all knowing, how can he in good faith act like he is surprised at anything that happens? He couldn't simply act like he was surprised because that would be a lie, a way to portray himself in a way that doesn't accurately describe him. It would make no sense why he would do this unless it was to meet a certain end or if he was forced to do this. Being forced to do a certain act or acting on pure instinct I don't believe can always be considered a sin even if the act is less than noble. That would be the case in a person being forced to kill in order to live. But this wouldn't apply to God since he should never be in a position where he is forced to do anything nor is he ever going to have to act on instinct since he knows everything that will happen and shouldn't need to deal with instincts because they are the definition of a mortal being such as humans are.\n \n But I'm straying away from the topic now.",

Yet, from what parts of God's plans we have seen unravel, it would seem that he doesn't really have a plan. I mean the devil nearly takes over his home, his planet needed to be destroyed because it was going so badly and will eventually need to be destroyed again before he can get things working right, and most of this is the fault of Adam and Eve which was something God knew was going to happen. If he never did make a mistake, I really find it hard to explain what his real plan is.\n \n I don't know where you got the idea that emotions are a result of weakness. Emotions are a feeling - they aren't a sign of anything. The way you react to your emotions can show you to be a weak or strong person, but the emotions themselves do not reveal this.\n \n * Emotions are weakness because they always involve a need of some sort. Either a need being fulfilled or not being met or neither. Certain human emotions are caused by conflicting data in the mind such as shock, awe, surprise, or fear, but God doesn't need to worry about this no doubt. Anyways, all of Gods emotions have to be caused by some sort of need and if God feels a need then he is displaying weakness which shouldn't be possible. But maybe I'm being too picky.",

I believe the Bible fully supports the idea of free will and even assuming that it says nothing at all, based on the way some things go it is hard to believe a good God would not only allow it to happen, but to make it happen is even worse. I mean, what else is there? If we don't have free will and God is the ultimate power, then he must be the one making decisions for us. Can't blame the Devil for everything. Nah I guess you could, but that wouldn't make God sound too good either if he was letting all of his prized creations have their fake lives destroyed by a demon.",

   "\n if God prevents you from making a decision, the he forces you to make the alternate decision. but you say this happens sometimes, which is like a partial free will...\n \n\n \n Yes, that is basically what I am saying, we have partial free will. Complete free will and christianity can't logically exist at the same time because the Bible states that God is all powerful. If God is all powerful, then he must have power over what you choose or don't choose. This doesn't mean that he always exercises that power, just that he could if he wanted to.\n \n \n\n if the only choices we can possibly make are the one God approves, then we dont have free will, because we cannot free choose the option that God does not approve of, which means we are forced to only choose the options that God approves of. this is not free will\n \n\n \n Your right, this is not complete free will. But as I mentioned before, if you give yourself free will, then you are saying God has no control over you or your actions -- and therefore he is not God anymore.\n \n \n\n how can sin even exist if God is contsnatly monitoring the decision process? does he approve of the sins that are commited? if the only decisions we can make are the ones God approves, then how is it so much sin is being commited?\n \n\n \n I don't think \"approve\" is the correct word. \"Allow\" would be a better word. God might not like what you choose to do, but still allow you to do it. \n \n \n\n the Biblical support for free will is the assumption that God is not willing that any man should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

Like I said before, you make your own decisions....but God has the ultimate authority and can \"veto\" your decisions if he wants.\n \n If you choose to rob a bank and God doesn't prevent you from doing it...did God force you to do it? No. \n \n Now, as you said, God's wish is that all men would be saved. Obiously if someone made the choice to be saved God would not intervene. \n \n \n Let me ask you a question if you believe man has complete free will to do whatever he wants. Do you think we could obliterate ourselves off the face of the earth tomorrow in a nuclear war -- and never fullfill the remainder of the phrophecies in the bible?

Following them or not following them will not change anything.

The bible often refers to God as our Father, and I think this is a good way of looking at the free will issue.\n \n When you were growing up, your parents probably allowed you to do what ever you wanted most of the time...but sometimes they would intervene and make you clean your room or tell you not to play with one of your friends anymore because he was a bad influence. Does this mean that your parents controlled your life? No, of course not. They simply \"guided\" you in certain directions when appropriate.",
