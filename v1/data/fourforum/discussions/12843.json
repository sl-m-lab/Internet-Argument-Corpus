   "While the two Circuits were ultimately deciding the same issue, incorporation of the 2nd Amendment under the 14th, the legal paths each was compelled to follow were very different and certainly not comparable. When examined, those paths fully explain and validate the two unquestionably divergent conclusions . . . While it seems crazy, they both were right and that sets up a wonderful set of legal quandaries for SCOTUS to settle.\n \n The 7th, in deciding issues of Illinois gun control have had the advantage of Presser v Illinois (decided before the Court's doctrine of selective incorporation was begun) and the Illinois RKBA provision, which when enacted in 1970, explicitly conditioned their RKBA, \"subject to the police power.\" (I'll leave to the reader to discern what societal issues were paramount in the years just before the provision's enactment).\n \n So, based on the rulings of the Supreme Court (including Heller, which could not address incorporation), the 7th's own decisions and also guided by lower court rulings that followed the law, the 7th had only one way to rule, exactly as it did. \n \n I welcome the 7th's decision; it was correctly decided (for that Circuit) and could be, in my opinion, the best \"next step\" case for examining the applicability of the 2nd on the states (considering present SCOTUS precedent and the Illinois RKBA provision with its inclusion of a restrictive clause). It will permit a more encompassing decision to be arrived by SCOTUS; certainly better than Heller with its limited scope or a case from a state with no state RKBA provision or one with an expansive, unquestionable individual self defense right guarantee like Pennsylvania's. Illinois has significant restrictions on the citizen's RKBA and for now, it is completely and legitimately endorsed by judicial review to date.\n \n Illinois has had a very deep and extensive examination of their citizen's RKBA and that legal history will give us a quite comprehensive decision once SCOTUS rules on this. There won't be many unanswered questions or gray areas of what gun control laws (federal, state and local) are permitted when this shakes out . . .\n \n 7th Circuit's decision in NRA v Chicago issued 6-2-09 (99KB pdf)\n mp3 of oral arguments NRA v Chicago held 5-26-09 (5.86MB mp3)\n \n When we look at the Nordyke decision in the 9th we see an entirely different situation with not so compelling issues for SCOTUS to review for incorporation. \n \n California does not have a RKBA provision in its constitution . . . The state legislature has assumed this to mean that just about anything goes. When Cali's gun control laws were contested by a citizen, state and lower federal courts lazily relied and built upon the 1940's lower federal court cases where the \"state's right\" or \"collective right\" perversion was hatched, primarily U.S. v. Tot, 131 F.2d 261 (3rd Cir. 1942) (51KB pdf). This new theory birthed in Tot was never examined further, explained or supported with philosophical, historical or legal justification; it just \"was\" and it served its sole purpose to extinguish the claim of the protections of the 2nd by individual citizens in the state and lower federal courts across America.\n \n In the opposite of Illinois and the 7th, California state courts and lower federal courts of that jurisdiction never developed their own sophisticated legal history for affirming their laws; they just built their house of \"precedent\" on that single post which, for many years, was good enough for them to rule, \"COLLECTIVE RIGHT! NO STANDING! and send the complaintents on their way . . . \n \n Not anymore!\n \n That single post has been knocked out by hurricane Heller and California's and the 9th's entire gun control validating scheme has been swept away. In light of Heller, the judges in Nordyke had to re-visit the case and in light of SCOTUS's unanimous individual right opinion in Heller, the 9th was forced to examine its earlier ruling:\n \". . . we must first decide whether Heller abrogated Hickman. It did. Hickman rested on our conclusion that the Second Amendment protects only a collective right; Heller squarely overruled such conclusion. . . . Thus the basis for Hickman's holding has evaporated, and the opinion is clearly irreconcilable with Heller. In such circumstances, we consider our prior decision abrogated by higher authority.\"\n \n Nordyke v King, pg 4475-4476, (April 20, 2009) (194KB .pdf) \n With such a clean slate it was not a stretch to decide incorporation when the doctrine which SCOTUS has established to apply the 14th, (crafted after Presser v Illinois), is honestly applied to the philosophical, historical and legal history of the RKBA and the 2nd Amendment. . . \n \n This case has ramifications for other states who also followed the flawed California recipe, especially New Jersey . . . New Jersey is another state without a RKBA provision and thin RKBA precedent of its own. Its courts too lazily relied on Tot for validating it's ID cards and purchase permits, registration schemes and a myriad of other discriminatory practices (see Burton v. Sills, 248 A.2d 521 (N.J. 1968). . . It is all on legal death row awaiting the warrant to be signed by the Supreme Court.\n \n There is meat for SCOTUS to sink its teeth into with these two cases, with the 9th's Nordyke we will finally get the complete repudiation and burial of the \"state's right\" / \"collective right\" interpretation and the striking down of every case that uses that reasoning for its holding. With the 7th's NRA v Chicago we get an examination of the late 1800's cases where incorporation was frustrated by racial politics and we will finally get a ruling of how far a state can go in restricting a right explicitly secured by the federal Constitution. \n \n As a supporter of the concept of limited government powers and the concept that the Bill of Rights only redundantly forbids government to exercise powers never granted, I am very optimistic that the Constitution (and thus law-abiding gun owners) will win!",

   "WHETHER THE SECOND AMENDMENT SECURES AN INDIVIDUAL RIGHT\n \n The Second Amendment secures a right of individuals generally, not a right of States or a right restricted to persons serving in militias.\n \n August 24, 2004\n \n MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\n \n I do believe all the yea, yea and nay, nay is about over and the rubber is going to meet the road.\n \n Conclusion by the DOJ:\n \nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Second Amendment secures an individual right to keep and to bear arms. Current case law leaves open and unsettled the question of whose right is secured by the Amendment. Although we do not address the scope of the right, our examination of the original meaning of the Amendment provides extensive reasons to conclude that the Second Amendment secures an individual right, and no persuasive basis for either the collective-right or quasi-collective-right views. The text of the Amendment's operative clause, setting out a \"right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\" is clear and is reinforced by the Constitution's structure. The Amendment's prefatory clause, properly understood, is fully consistent with this interpretation. The broader history of the Anglo-American right of individuals to have and use arms, from England's Revolution of 1688-1689 to the ratification of the Second Amendment a hundred years later, leads to the same conclusion. Finally, the first hundred years of interpretations of the Amendment, and especially the commentaries and case law in the pre-Civil War period closest to the Amendment's ratification, confirm what the text and history of the Second Amendment require.\n\n \n The incorporation of the BOR occured when the States adopted the Constitution. The XIVth applied those same rights found in the documents to the newly freed slaves but was meant to apply 'equally\" to all citizens. (more could be said about the reasons for the 14th's adoption) .<snip<",

   "The 7th. circuit has a history of being far more reserved than the 9th. The 7th. is merely telling us that it is not the proper body to rule on incorporation. By contrast, it did not surprise me that the 9th. would go out on its own and try to live at the tip of the constitutional spear. It has tried for years to make law and drag the rest of the nation in its wake, and the 9th. enjoys an impressive track record of being repeatedly smacked back down by SCOTUS for ignoring its prior precedents. The 7th. in contrast merely reaffirms that selective incorporation is the SCOTUS way and demurs to SCOTUS to decide whether to incorporate the 2nd. Amendment. I too welcome this decision. It helps ripen the vine because it sets up the classic discord amongst the circuits which historically has compelled SCOTUS to step in and declare one way or the other for uniformity's sake. I think now there is a good possibility SCOTUS will feel compelled to take on the incorporation issue.\n \n Unlike the 9th's past attempts to rule contrary to prior SCOTUS cases, in this instance each circuit believed (correctly, in my opinion) that it was writing on a blank slate-and it is interesting to see how they handled themselves. One advises caution while the other forges ahead. You can compare the difference in their approach to the incorporation issue with this analogy: They are both children who have stumbled on their father's (SCOTUS') police radio. The more conservative 7th. turns his back on it saying \"only father has the authority to push those buttons\"-while the more liberal 9th. says \"let me at it I can do just as good a job talking on that radio.\"\n \n ---\n \n The issue, however, is not whether court rules are \"mutable\"; they assuredly are. It is not whether, in the light of \"various circumstances,\" they can be \"modifi[ed]\"; they assuredly can. The issue is whether, as mutated and modified, they must make sense. The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy. Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 455 (2000) (Scalia, dissenting).",
