I'm not offended, though I'm atheist. And on the other side, who cares if people say Happy Holidays. Well, for that question there are a lot of people; primarily the Religious Right of Christendom, but isn't it going a bit far to punish the people who take a neutral ground? It's better than saying... dare I say it... Happy Chanukah! The entire debate is silly... neither side should be offended, as \"holidays\" refer to Christmas as well and I have yet to meet someone who the words \"Merry Christmas\" actually offend. If I am wrong, you can post it here, but I think people are entitled to their own religion, and are entitled to express it as long as they aren't trying to convert others.\n \n Someday, this won't be a problem, and it will be perfectly acceptable to say the word \"holiday.\"\n \n Until then, have a Fabulous Flying-Spaghetti-Monster Day!

   "... I have yet to meet someone who the words \"Merry Christmas\" actually offend.\n\n \n You just found one.\n \n I am especially offended when Christians spew their crud about Christmas, like the following fundie did in our local newspaper: I've emphasized some of his statements here. Below is my 300-word response letter to the editor.\n \n \nIn his Nov. 24 letter about WalMart's switching to 'Happy Holidays', Dick Barr makes several ridiculous comments. He says, \"We have been celebrating Christmas for more than 200 years on Dec. 25. If others want to celebrate other holidays, they should choose another date for that\". First, Jesus was not born on Dec. 25, so what exactly are the Christians celebrating on \"Christ's birthday\"? Second, the Christians effectively stole Dec. 25 from the pagans, who had already been celebrating that date for hundreds of years. Third, Jews - who do not recognize Jesus as the Christ - have been celebrating Hanukkah in December for more than 2000 years.\n \n Mr. Barr says he is offended by the change, but is he so insensitive to other people's feelings that he's incapable of seeing how Muslims, Jews, and Hindus that live here could be offended by the splashing of Christ-mas all over the place? Would Dick happily accept WalMart's putting up banners celebrating the major Muslim, Jewish, and Hindu holy days throughout the year? Why should the Christian religion get special treatment in a country that purports equal rights to, and equal treatment of, all people regardless of their religion? \n \n Mr. Barr goes on to say, \"If they are offended by our celebration of Christmas, they can go back to their homeland and celebrate at their heart's desire!\". Perhaps Dick doesn't realize that the Constitution - the actual founding document of our nation - is a secular document and makes no references to Jesus, Christ, or God (and the only two references to religion are exclusionary, stipulating what the government cannot do). This is not a Christian nation, and all religions are equally welcome. So where do Christians get off telling others to leave? What makes Christians think this is their home, only?\n",

   "I started off as a Young Earth Creationist, taking the Bible literally, then found that doing so is just plain stupid - ABSOLUTELY STUPID. The literally taken Bible is contradicted by science and logic. I then dropped the silliness of a young earth but retained the hard core anti-evolution stance. The OBJECTIVE, REPEATABLE, and VERIFIABLE evidences I was exposed to by college biology texts and material from my opponents on the net forced me to concede a lot of evolution, so became an ID proponent, where I stayed for many years. But even there I found the evidence against my new position to be too strong to resist, and so finally went all the way over the being a full fledged evolutionist. During these times - but not coinciding exactly with my switch to evolution - my religious beliefs were also changing: weakening, as rational thought led me away from Christianity. At some point, once I didn't need God to explain the diversity of life, I reexamined the Bible from a frame of reference of not being required to believe it: what did I find under this new frame of reference? The Holy Bible is ridiculous and quite fallible. So why believe it any more? Besides, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidences, and the extraordinary claims of Christianity - or any supernatural religion - don't have them. So I returned to the position that we all begin life with: a non-belief in God: atheism.\n\n \n Well I have a Bachelor of Science degree and there wasn't one thing in college biology or other science classes which I felt contradicted the Bible. I'm an Old Earth Creationist (which you should have checked out before checking out). Nowhere does the Bible say the earth was created 6,000 years ago, or that the first \"man\" (Adam) couldn't have been the first person CREATED IN THE LIKENESS AND IMAGE OF GOD (with an eternal spirit). As for extraordinary claims and evidences, you evolutionists certainly have more faith than a religious creationist could possible muster (i.e. the Big Bang, abiogenesis, and so on).",

   "EasyRider: ... and there wasn't one thing in college biology or other science classes which I felt contradicted the Bible.\n\n \n Sure there is. I guess you've never read the Bible!\n \n Gee, let's start at the beginning, shall we. Consider what Genesis says about seed-bearing land plants with fruits and animals. Here is the passage from the NIV Bible.\n \n \nThen God said, \"Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.\" And it was so. The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seeds according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening, and there was morning - the third day.\n \n ...\n \n And God said, \"Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.\" So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that is was good. ... And there was evening, and there was morning - the fifth day.\n \n And God said, \"Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds; livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind.\" And it was so. God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. ... God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning - the sixth day.\n (Genesis 1:11-13, 20-21, 23-25, 31) \n\n \n According to the Bible, angiosperms (the seed-bearing plants with fruit) were created before any animals. Science/evolution directly contradicts such a claim. \n \n \nThe oldest definitive trace of flowing plants to appear in the fossil record is of pollen grains in Cretaceous rocks some 130 million years old, whereas the oldest fossilized flowers are about 120 million years old. (However, a fossil flower was tentatively identified in 130-million-year-old rocks in southern England in 1996). \n (Biology: Fifth Edition, Solomon, Berg, and Martin, Saunders College Publishing, 1999, p584) \n\n \n Yet we know of animals - simple bilaterians - dating back to 580 to 600 million years. So the Bible is GROSSLY off on this chronology. Genesis creation myth refuted.\n \n \n Also, in part of the above quote from the Genesis, the Bible states that specific types of animals were created on the same day, whereas evolution/science directly refutes the claim.\n \n \nAnd God said, \"Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.\" \n (Genesis 1:20) \n\n \n Birds appeared at the same time as living creatures in the waters? No way!! Birds didn't arise until some 150 million years ago (off the top of my head) whereas the waters had living creatures at least 540 million years ago (base of the Cambrian explosion) and actually all the way back to 3.5 billion years ago (as evidenced by stromatolites). The Genesis creation myth isn't even close!\n \n \n Another failed chronology for the Genesis creation: it has LAND animals being created AFTER birds! Not at all consistent with science/evolution. \n \n Finally, Genesis has God creating plants BEFORE the sun. Gee, I think I read somewhere that science kind of has it the other way around! :-)\n \n The Holy Bible's fairy tale about Creation is refuted. \n \n \nEasyRider: I'm an Old Earth Creationist ...\n\n \n Doesn't matter. The order of appearance specified in Genesis has been disproven by science, no matter how long each \"day\" is for you.\n \n \n \nEasyRider: As for extraordinary claims and evidences, you evolutionists certainly have more faith than a religious creationist could possible muster (i.e. the Big Bang, abiogenesis, and so on).\n\n \n Evolution has nothing to do with the Big Bang: two completely different realms of reality.\n \n Evolution does not deal with abiogenesis: two different things.",

Paul, who wrote in the 50's and 60's, only focused on his death. \n He didn't have anything else, and he is the earliest writer ABOUT Jesus.\n \n It is the later generations that got more elaborate.\n\n \n This lame argument that because some historical account was written several decades after an event - therefore it cannot be accurate - is foolishness. For instance, I could write an excellent and accurate account of my Vietnam experiences from 35 years ago. \n \n And you say Paul only focused on his death? Have you never read 1st Thessalonians 4:14, which dispells your argument? Or Paul's list of all the individuals who had seen him after he arose? Come on, Trebor. Please be more accurate on your claims.",
