   "Oh my...\n \n \n\"It's been 30 years since John W. Hinckley Jr. stood outside the Washington Hilton Hotel on a gray, misty day and tried to kill the President of the United States with a .22 caliber that he'd loaded with six Devastator bullets, designed to explode on impact....\n\n \n I think this paragraph alone undoes the seriousness of whatever message you're trying to get across Galileo. Let's look at the concept of exploding bullets. It's pure bunk. There are rounds that are designed to expand and even fragment on contact with a hard target matter for the purpose of reducing ricochets and overpenetration, but I've never heard of exploding bullets before. To the best of my knowledge the concept is completely impossible.\n \n Had John Hinckley Jr. actually used \"exploding bullets\" it's likely that Jim Brady would have died at the time of the shooting and buried without part of his head/face.\n \n For an \"exploding bullet\" to be real the construction would have to involve a highly volatile material capable of causing an actual explosion on its own once the proper chain reaction was met. We're not talking about the impact force of the bullet to deform the target when struck but rather the bullet being a miniaturized bomb and constructed of some chemical composition besides simple lead.\n \n Of course this matter is complicated by the simple physics involved with firing a gun. The heat of the igniting powder and the friction of the bullet being driven down the barrel and engaging the rifling grooves to impart spin on it would surely be enough trauma to cause the \"exploding bullet\" to ignite and explode right in the gun barrel shouldn't it? The very process is enough to deform a regular bullet made of simple lead, surely it would cause an \"exploding bullet\" to detonate prematurely before it ever hit the target.\n \n Maybe you can explain to us how the physical abuse suffered by an \"exploding bullet\" on the base and the sides will be insufficient to cause it's explosive charge to be set off, yet the nose impacting a soft target will be more than enough to ensure the detonation process.\n \n \n\"Former White House press secretary James Brady is 70. The most gravely wounded and the first one shot, he sustained a massive brain injury that left him paralyzed on one side and forever impaired. Timothy McCarthy, now 62, was a Secret Service agent trained to take a bullet for the person he was protecting. That's what he did. He dived across my father and was shot in the abdomen. Thomas Delahanty is 76. On March 30, 1981, he was a District of Columbia police officer. After being struck in the back by one of Hinckley's bullets, he was left with permanent nerve damage and was forced to retire....\n\n \n And why exactly do Secret Service agents not wear kevlar vests that are capable of defeating common handgun ammunition? Are we to believe that they're naked except for their business suits and equipped with absolutely no protection that would ensure a bullet didn't pass through them and hit the President should a shot be fired?\n \n And how exactly do you manage to dive in front of a bullet? It's traveling at a speed of 800+ feet per second and being fired from a distance of less than 100 or so feet. That means the bullet can hit a target in around 1/8th of a second, less time than it takes you to blink. How does anybody manage to throw themselves in front of a bullet when such speeds are the norm?\n \n \" 'But there were other victims too,' Sarah Brady tells me now, so many years later but so close to the wound. 'Our son Scott was 2 years old then. The first time I took him to the hospital to see his father, Jim wailed - that awful sound he'd started making - and it frightened Scott so much, it was years before he felt comfortable around Jim.'\n \n \nThis is a sobering reminder that the laws we support or oppose can have tragic and devastating consequences for others.\n\n \n Could you give us an example of any gun control law that would have prevented John Hinckley from somehow acquiring a gun and using it in an attempt to carry out an assassination? Any law at all? What answers do you have Galileo that would have prevented this problem?\n \n I have news for you Galileo. If you scour the news you'll find plenty of examples of people being shot in the head and they survive without serious health issues afflicting them for the rest of their lives. Even brain shots aren't guaranteed to seriously impact your health and well being. It's not really like the movies make you think.",

   "Oh. When I read the title of this thread, I thought you were going to talk about the lives saved by gun ownership and the defensive gun use. I know that their are a lot of figures thrown around, but here is the absolute lowest figure I could find. Absolute lowest and in my view, Anti-gun biased. \n \n One of Galileo's favorite. \n \n www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/165476.pdf By renowned anti-gun researchers Philip J. Cook and Jenz Ludwig.\n \n Guns in America: National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms\n \n \n On the basis of National Crime\n Victimization Survey (NCVS) data, one\n would conclude that defensive uses\n are rare indeed, about 108,000 per\n year. \n\n \n The National Academy of Sciences report. Yet another of Galileo's favorites. \n   The Use of Firearms to Defend Against Criminals \n \n   The Use of Firearms to Defend Against Criminals \n COUNTING DEFENSIVE GUN USES\n \n How many times each year do civilians use firearms defensively? The answers provided to this seemingly simple question have been confusing. Consider the findings from two of the most widely cited studies in the field: McDowall et al. (1998), using the data from 1992 and 1994 waves of the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), found roughly 116,000 defensive gun uses per year, and Kleck and Gertz (1995), using data from the 1993 National Self-Defense Survey (NSDS), found around 2.5 million defensive gun uses each year.\n\n My, that is a lot crime stopped by owning a gun! No? We don't want to consider these? These are the good law-abiding people. emoticon_smile",

Everyone knew what they were getting paid for when they took the job.\n \n Now, let's get down to the true tragedies like Ruby Ridge and children and nursing mothers shot by the HRT and unholy allieance of gov't goons.\n \n Waco, 86 men but mostly women and children burned and/or shot or both by ATF out of their job description and title.\n \n The current scandle of ATF arming Mexican criminals and already 3 gov't employees and embassy members X two shot with ATF smuggled guns.\n \n Libya, Obama and Hillary arming AlQueda, the rebels but our enemies since the Barbary Pirates and before.\n \n Let's get down to the nitty gritty, the gun grabbers hit the end of the rope with membership and monetarily and this supposedly tear jerker is to drum up support of weak minded people and get into their billfolds if possible.\n \n Where is your true sympathy for folks like Suzanna Gratia Hupp who were disarmed by government edicts (unconstitutionally) while we arm our enemies of America and gun grabber/anti-Constitutionalists? I have no sympathy for people like the bradys nor McCarthy whose policies would make victims of us all if they could. My only regret is they got off easy. People who advocate unConstitutional laws and promote them are not worthy of sympathy and should have been deported long ago. They didn't learn a darn thing from experience other than to try to punish everyone who didn't do it. I posted an article this week about the pschotic problem of left wingers, you fit the bill and so do they.\n \n You even quote communists with a supposedly shocking statement like \"John Lott busted again\" and that is it, zilch, nada, zero proof other than the complaint he posted under a pseudo name...just like you other gun grabbers with no pride and ashamed to show a birth certificate that doesn't exist.\n \n You personally are an Australian and have no dog in our fight; you have no rights nor a Constitution but are willing to poke your nose in support of any enemy of the Constitution or America. Think you got support? hahahahahahahaha HA. emoticon_xbye",
