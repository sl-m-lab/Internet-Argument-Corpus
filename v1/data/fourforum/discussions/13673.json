   "CSU student board votes in favor of guns on campus \n written by: Jeffrey Wolf Eric Kahnert \n \n FORT COLLINS - Only a few universities in the country allow students to carry guns on campus, and one of them in Colorado is considering a change. \n \n At Colorado State University in Fort Collins, public safety experts and the president's cabinet support a gun ban. \n \n Before the decision is made, however, the school wants to hear what students think. \n \n Wednesday night, the student governing body voted 21-3 in support of keeping CSU a conceal-and-carry campus. Five student senators were absent or did not vote. \n \n The student leaders will now submit their resolution to the CSU president for consideration. \n \n Author of the bill, CSU Junior Cooper Anderson said, \"We wrote this bill because we felt that a student should have the right to self defense on campus. We don't believe that crime stops at a campus' borders.\" \n \n CSU spokesperson Brad Bohlander says the Public Safety Team and the president's cabinet are united against the issue. \n \n \"More availability and more access to weapons on a highly populated college campus can potentially lead to more negative incidents,\" Bohlander told 9NEWS. \n \n Besides Utah, where universities aren't allowed to ban guns, CSU is one of only a handful of universities across the country allowing concealed weapons. \n \n CSU has never had a violent gun incident on campus. \n \n \"I think whenever you create a gun-free zone, you have an opportunity for criminals to act with impunity,\" Larimer County Sheriff Jim Alderden said. \n \n Some students think CSU should be a gun-free zone. \n \n \"I don't think we should be allowed to have firearms on campus. I think it's dangerous and not needed. I think people shouldn't have guns just in general. If you have guns, that just causes more violence,\" Freshman Victoria Arias said. \n \n Bohlander says CSU has a strong safety policy in place. \n \n \"Our police can respond to an incident anywhere on the main campus within about two minutes or less, and the highly populated classrooms in about a minute. They have all gone through active shooter training,\" Bohlander said. \n \n Bohlander says CSU's president could make a final decision on the ban anytime between now and this spring. \n \n 9NEWS.com | Colorado's Online News Leader | CSU student board votes in favor of guns on campus",

Heller)\n\n \n Uh huh, pretend the SCOTUS did not dismiss those ideas in Lopez nor in Morrison . The ruling in Lopez was the federal government had no jurisdiction in firearms on school grounds because it had nothing to do with interstate commerce. Morrison was a rape case and the SCOTUS declined on the same grounds. There is a limit on \"longstanding prohibitions\" and \"conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms\" once it is determined to be incorporated and apply equally to all government bodies.\n \n Rights are not to be infringed...period. There has to be a revue of when felons or the mentally ill become competent or else a law becomes a bill of attainder. Many States are already claiming sovereignty by making arms produced in the State unreachable by Federal claims of interstate commerce. I have to wonder what incorporation under the XIVth amendment will do to all the knee jerk laws that were passed as crime control and is proven bad law already. Most enhanced sentences have been cast aside by cases like Castillio.\n \n Who is going to enforce laws that must infringe on the IVth Amendment? Do you suspect campus police or deans are immune to civil right protections? Your ideal of a police state where you can incriminate someone by making an illegal search or seizure by your mere herasay is pretty well going to be a dead concept. You will risk perjury for filing a false affidavit also :)\n \n \nIn both Harris and Dunlap, a state Supreme Court imposed a Fourth Amendment rule that a single source of suspicion did not allow the police to take an important investigative step. In Dunlap, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had ruled that the officer who saw a \"single isolated transaction\" that he strongly believed was a drug buy did not have probable cause to make an arrest based on it. In Harris, the Virginia Supreme Court ruled that an officer who received a report of a drunk driver did not have reasonable suspicion to stop the car based on it.\n\n \n There are some interesting cases coming before THE COURT this session and since 1996 they have become more diligent in expanding rights instead of contracting them so I doubt any of the rulings will surprise me but will probably shock you? :)\n \n Also 18 USC 1036 precludes entry by false pretences to any real property TO be used against State and Local officials.\n \n Do you have any other wishes for Santa this year? :) emoticon_xgood",

   "Do \"Gun-Free\" Zones Encourage School Shootings? - HUMAN EVENTS\n \n \nA 14-year-old suspended high school student entered Cleveland's Success Tech Academy, a gun in each hand, and opened fire, wounding four. Later, we learn that the shooter's past included violent confrontations, mental problems and at least one previous suspension. A month earlier he told a friend that he intended to shoot up the school. But no one, apparently, took his behavior seriously enough to notify authorities.\n \n Meanwhile, a high school teacher in Oregon, with a permit to carry a concealed weapon plus training, sought permission to carry her firearm to school. In fear of her ex-husband, against whom she filed and received two restraining orders, she wanted the ability to protect herself in the event he showed up. Furthermore, she argued that even without the fear of her ex-husband, the Second Amendment and Oregon state law allow her to carry her firearm to work. Her school district, however, prevents her from carrying a firearm to school. \n \n \n This raises a question. Do shooters consider schools \"gun-free zones\"? Do they consider it unlikely that any authority figure -- whether teachers or, in some cases, security guards -- poses an armed threat? But in some school shooting cases, guns helped to end shooting sprees and minimize loss of life and injury.\n \n Edinboro, Pennsylvania. A 14-year-old middle school student opened fire at a school graduation dance, being held at a local restaurant. The shooter killed one teacher and wounded two students and another teacher. The armed teenager was apprehended by the restaurant owner, who grabbed his own shotgun from his office and went after the shooter. Staring into the owner's shotgun, the teen dropped his gun and surrendered.\n \n Pearl, Mississippi. A 16-year-old sophomore entered Pearl High with a hunting rifle under his overcoat. He opened fire, killing two students and wounding seven. The assistant principal, Joel Myrick, ran to his truck and retrieved the .45 automatic he kept there. Running back, he spotted the shooter in the parking lot. Ordering the teen to stop, the vice principal put his gun to the shooter's neck and held him until police arrived.\n \n Grundy, Virginia. At Appalachian Law School, a disgruntled student on the verge of his second suspension entered a school building and shot and killed the dean and a professor. He then shot four students, killing one. Hearing the shots fired, two students, Michael Gross and Tracy Bridges, ran to their cars to retrieve their guns. With guns aimed at the shooter, Bridges ordered him to drop his weapon. When the shooter turned and saw Bridges' gun, he laid down his weapon and put his hands in the air. (My pro-Second Amendment documentary, \"Michael and Me,\" goes into detail about this incident, as well as others.)\n \n Professor and economist John Lott checked 280 separate news stories in the week after the Appalachian Law School shooting, and only found four that mentioned the students who stopped the shooter had guns. The Washington Post, for example, said the students \"helped subdue\" the killer. Newsday wrote the shooter was \"restrained by students.\" The Richmond (Va.) Times-Dispatch, however, wrote that the shooter \"was wrestled to the ground by fellow students, one of whom aimed his own revolver at [the killer].\" Four months later, the Times-Dispatch detailed the students' actions, including the second student's use of a gun.\n \n What do felons think about an armed citizenry? A survey of convicted felons by the National Institute of Justice found 74 percent of the felons agreed that, \"One reason burglars avoid houses when people are home is that they fear being shot during the crime.\"\n The survey also asked these felons whether they had abandoned at least one crime because they feared the intended victim might be armed. Thirty-nine percent said they abandoned at least one crime; 8 percent had abandoned such a crime \"many\" times; 34 percent admitted being \"scared off, shot at, wounded, or captured by an armed victim\"; and nearly 70 percent knew a \"colleague\" who had abandoned a crime, been scared off, been shot at, wounded or captured by a victim packing heat.\n \n A survey of 23,113 police chiefs and sheriffs across the country found that 62 percent of these top cops agreed that \"a national concealed handgun permit would reduce rates of violent crime.\" About 80 percent of rank-and-file police officers, according to polls, support the right of trained citizens to carry concealed weapons. \n \n Israel gets it. Since the 1970s, on school campuses in Israel, policy requires teachers and parent aides to arm themselves with semi-automatic weapons. The result? School shootings have plummeted to zero.\n \n As for Cleveland, would allowing authority figures to arm themselves have resulted in reduced casualties, or perhaps even deterred the shooter in the first place? No one can say for sure. But no doubt at least some Cleveland parents now believe the benefits of armed campus adults outweigh the costs.\n \n *FOR SCHOLARSHIP AND EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY!",

The argument over whether the 2A is legitimate and an individual right is OVER. Your reluctance to concede the point is nuts but your continued clinging to an already demonstrable defeat of your gun grabber theology has been ruled null and void. The only reason Colorado is having this debate now is because of all the pretty people from kalifornia have led an invasion by moving there to escape the socialist hell hole and are now attempting to recreate what they fled in another place...kind of like what you are doing.\n \n Your main point that it was a collective right has died a well deserved death. Although it is amusing to watch you grasping at straws and trying to ressurect gun grabber news bites and propaganda the next case before the court will seal the deal. Despite your intended ignorance of the cert process and briefs they do mean quite a bit and the court does have to consider them. In the McDonald case, the briefs for are over 30+ and only two gun grabber briefs trying to argue to the contrary. Do not think the Court doesn't take this into account.\n \n You keep beating that dead horse but he will never rise again. The majority consensus of the right being individual is supported by history and intent in the Constitution and is about to be reaffirmed. people do not overlook the fact that the only way to stop a bad man with a gun is with a good man with a gun. You keep rehashing the tired, worn and disproven dogma because that is all you know. I get tired of your (deleted by poster) day in and day out as much as we did before old Sarge demolished your source you still cling to as a cite although it has been rebuked and discredited and humiliated as a celebrated lie and hoax.\n \n Now I don't know what you can stand on for any revelancey because in your case there is none. It is not a mark of intelligence to deny the undeniable nor is it patriotic nor is it wise and commendable. It is just as tiring, wrong and idiotic as it was 10 years ago even though your ilk was discredited as it has been in the countries that ate the forbidden fruit and increased the lack of protection of victims and glorified criminals.\n \n It simply isn't fun to stomp a mudhole in your posterior any longer it is just a dreary dierre and an unwanted task to keep pointing out your ignorance of facts as you rely on misreading court decisions like Miller and incorrectly assume it meant something collective when most cases including Heller discounts that line of reasoning. Your choice to pick out dicta, as NATO tirelessly keeps pointing out is beyond your comprehension.\n \n Look, we will quit trying to look so smart if you will quit acting so dumb...or is it just an act?",

   "The Folly of Unilateral Disarmament - Reason Magazine\n \n \nJudging from the comments of those who support this policy of victim disarmament, Smith's desire for a gun was irrational. According to Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, \"This latest tragedy, at a heavily fortified army base, ought to convince more Americans to reject the argument that the solution to gun violence is to arm more people with more guns in more places.\" \n Note how the reference to \"a heavily fortified army base\" obscures the crucial point that the people attacked by Hasan were unarmed as a matter of policy. Also note the breathtaking inanity of Helmke's assurance that \"more guns\" are not \"the solution to gun violence.\" In this case, they assuredly were. \n \n The first people with guns to confront Hasan, two local police officers, were the ones who put a stop to his rampage. And while Sgt. Kim Munley and Sgt. Mark Todd acted heroically, they did not arrive on the scene until a crucial 10 minutes or so had elapsed and Hasan had fired more than 100 rounds. \n \n If someone else at the processing center had a gun when Hasan started shooting, it seems likely that fewer people would have been killed or injured. Furthermore, the knowledge that some of his victims would be armed might have led him to choose a different, softer target in order to maximize the impact of his attack. \n \n There would have been plenty of targets to choose from: any of the locations in Texas, including public schools, universities, and shopping malls, that advertise their prohibition of gun possession. The problem is that crazed killers tend not to follow such rules. \n \n That problem was vividly illustrated by the second deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, which occurred in Killeen, Texas, a stone's throw from Fort Hood. In 1991 George Jo Hennard drove his pickup truck through the window of a Luby's cafeteria in Killeen, jumped out, and began firing two pistols at the defenseless customers and employees inside, killing 23 of them. \n \n One customer, Suzanna Hupp, saw Hennard gun down her parents. Hupp later testified that she had brought a handgun with her that day but, to her bitter regret, left it in her car, as required by state law. The massacre led the Texas legislature to approve a \"shall issue\" law that allows any resident who meets certain objective criteria to obtain a concealed carry permit. \n \n But people with such permits are still barred from bringing their weapons into areas designated as gun-free zones. And when a killer fires on people he knows will be unarmed, it matters little whether he has 20-round or 10-round magazines, a detail emphasized in press coverage of the Fort Hood massacre. The second or two it takes to switch magazines is a minor nuisance when the people you are shooting at cannot shoot back. \n \n Even less relevant is the allegation that Hasan used illegal armor-piercing ammunition. The Brady Campaign bizarrely chose to highlight that claim even though there was no indication that any of Hasan's victims were wearing bullet-proof vests, let alone that his bullets penetrated them. Perhaps the group hoped that such puzzling illogic would distract people from the plain fact that having a gun is better than not having one when you are confronted by a homicidal maniac. \n \n Jacob Sullum is a senior editor at Reason and a nationally syndicated columnist.\n\n \n For scholarship and educational use only!",

   "For what it is worth, I do not believe incorporation of the 2nd. Amendment against the states will affect state laws banning firearms on school grounds unless SCOTUS expands its reasoning in Heller to do so. Heller clearly suggests that such bans would survive incorporation. But this is just my opinion. Feel free to disagree.\n \n I for one favor permitting concealed carry on campus for CCW permit holders. I have said this before, and in an earlier thread someone asked this question in response: \n \n &#8220;Have you considered that having a gun on campus creates the opportunity for a violent incident, where one wouldn't be available normally?&#8221;\n \n I want to answer the question again by first noting I have heard a variant of this question many times before.\n \n It was asked when we decided to allow airline pilots to carry firearms again: &#8220;Have you considered having a gun (on a plane) increases the opportunity for a violent incident, where one wouldn&#8217;t be available normally?&#8221; \n \n The argument advanced against this policy was that the same pilot we trust with our lives&#8212;to land a plane safely, to not commit suicide with it by crashing it into a building&#8212;cannot be trusted with a gun. If he had a gun then he might go off and shoot someone&#8212;or so the argument went. We have trusted pilots to carry for years now, and this prophecy of blood spilled in the skies has not been fulfilled. \n \n Now the argument can be made that pilots go through a rigorous training program and this somehow makes them different than ordinary citizen CCW permit holders&#8230;.\n \n Consider the case of Florida, then. Florida was mocked when it decided to revamp its CCW permit law and make it far easier to lawfully carry concealed. Opponents of concealed carry started calling Florida the &#8220;gunshine state.&#8221; They said we could not trust the citizens to carry firearms, and they made dire predictions of how traffic accidents would now become shootouts. The same argument was raised there: &#8220;Have you considered having a gun (in someone&#8217;s purse or car) increases the opportunity for a violent incident, where one wouldn&#8217;t be available normally?&#8221; \n \n Florida chose to trust its citizens to carry concealed, and where is the increase in violence from the permit holders?\n \n The Commonwealth of Virginia decided some fifteen years ago to relax its CCW permit law and allow more people to carry concealed&#8212;at that time without any training requirement whatsoever. The same argument was made against that law: &#8220;Have you considered having a gun (in someone&#8217;s pocket/purse/car) increases the opportunity for a violent incident, where one wouldn&#8217;t be available normally?&#8221; \n \n Virginia trusted its citizens to carry concealed, and where is the increase in violence by CCW permit holders?\n \n In addition, Virginia has for years trusted CCW permit holders to have a firearm while on a secondary school campus&#8212;without a single incident of violence. \n \n Many states have for years trusted CCW permit holders. Has anyone ever cited a mass shooting&#8212;from any location&#8212;which was caused by a CCW permit holder? \n \n Now turn to students and faculty/staff members who have CCW permits. Yes, I have considered the question raised above. But I believe that question is based upon fear without foundation&#8212;while my position is based upon trust. \n \n We trust these students/faculty members to make calculations which help NASA guide a spacecraft to Mars. We trust them to enter and make use of nuclear reactor facilities. We trust them to handle and learn about deadly infectious diseases. We trust them to operate on people in teaching hospitals. \n \n But we can&#8217;t trust them to carry concealed on campus? \n \n Bear in mind the State which issues them a CCW permit already trusts them to carry concealed when they go grocery shopping at Food Lion, and when they buy a cheeseburger at the local McDonalds. That trust has not been misplaced. (the same applies to non-school personnel&#8212;like the CCW permit holding HVAC repair man who comes to work on a campus building and who is already trusted to carry concealed to and from other job sites.) \n \n And so the real question becomes: For those who already have a CCW permit, is there any evidence to suggest they suddenly decompensate and become untrustworthy the moment they set foot on campus, only to become rehabilitated and able to safely carry concealed again when they leave and go home to their off campus apartments or to the video store? \n \n Let&#8217;s be honest here. Isn&#8217;t a ban on firearms on campus based upon a belief that no one can be trusted at anytime, anywhere, for any reason to carry concealed&#8212;despite the overwhelming lack of evidence to support that belief? Isn&#8217;t support for a campus ban based upon the logic that if you can&#8217;t ban concealed carry altogether then a partial, location based ban is better than having no ban at all&#8212;sort of a fear monger&#8217;s consolation prize, if you will? \n \n Be honest, now. If you support a campus ban, then don&#8217;t you also believe we should ban concealed carry altogether? Or do you support concealed carry&#8212;just not on campus? If so, then how do you credibly argue that students/faculty/staff members can be trusted to carry concealed while shopping on aisle 7 for ice cream&#8212;but they cannot be trusted to carry concealed while learning about geology or history? \n \n 2 centuries + later, and T.J. and Becarria still hit the nail on the head.... \n \n ---\n \n &#8220;False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put an end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. They ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.&#8221; Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting with approval 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764.",
