   "Religion unfortunately has everything to do with gay rights. Historically the only reason homosexuality was ever outlawed was because it was against the Bible and God's will.\n \n Today most, if not all, of the anti-gay rights activists are also deeply religious. They may have other reasons as well, but still base a lot of their argument on that it is unnatural. What they mean is that it is against God, for after all there are enough other unnatural things nobody has a problem with. Even if they are not religious themselves they have usually been brought up by a strong religious family and had it repeatedly told to them that homosexuality is evil.\n \n And finally of course marriage is originally a religious ceremony, though it is less today.",
