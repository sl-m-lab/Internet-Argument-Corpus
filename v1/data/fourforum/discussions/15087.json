   "Grant Storms Arrested: Anti-Gay Christian Pastor Charged Over Public Masturbation\nRev. Grant Storms, a renowned anti-gay Christian pastor from Louisiana, was arrested last week for masturbating at a public park, in the vicinity of a carousel and playground where children were present.\n \n According to the New Orleans Times-Picayune, one woman saw Storms parked in his van \"looking at the playground area that contained children playing, with his zipper down...,\" the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office report read. After judging that Storms was masturbating, the woman and another mother who witnessed the event both alerted deputies.\n \n After being apprehended by authorities, Storms claimed that he had been urinating into a bottle. He was then booked for obscenity -- charges that he denied -- and then released due to overcrowding in the jail.\n \n The pastor appeared less willing to discuss the matter at a press conference on Tuesday, during which he blamed \"pornography\" for the incident.\n \n \"Pornography is destructive and it can ruin a person's life, and it ruined my life,\" he said at the conference, admitting that he had his hands in his pants, but maintaining that he wasn't masturbating. \"Do I have problems? Yes. Did I do something wrong? Yes.\"\n \n Despite his apology, which he also extended to the gay community, to which he has been a prominent opponent, Grants also denied claims that he had been \"looking at the children\" in the area.\n",

It has had limited success and all said an done has probably caused more harm then good. \n \n Knowledge without responsibility is more dangerous than than the lack of knowledge. If there can be a bright side we can only speculate that without religion to slow down progress that we would have been more cognizant of the repercussions of our actions and acted differently. With that perspective religion has served a purpose and still does, but it hasn't been managed well and is rapidly approaching a point where the cost is far to much to continue.\n \n You address the Bible through the eyes of misguided Christians, much of it having been corrupted and the rest being misunderstood. You know this but continue to accept it on their terms (by rejecting it because of their understanding is to accept they are right first) Not that it is true but if you take the position that it is possible and then look at what would be the point of the events that are described you can start to recognize parts that would make sense mixed in with the jibberish (mostly jibberish at this point though) keep what makes sense and lose the jibberish and it is a very different piece of work.

   "The Word of God trumps your ignorance.\n\n \n The word of your \"god\" is nothing more than man made archaic texts that even it's own followers can't agree upon. Hence the 38000 different official interpretations out there.\n \n Don't you think if this book, this word of \"god\" was infallible that there wouldn't be so mane different takes on it's meaning?\n \n \nYou don't want any god because your gay sex hedonism is at odds with it, and you don't want anything to twinge your feeble conscience. \n\n \n False. There are many gay Christians out there who live life within their own comfort and beliefs just fine. And you dare to call my conscience feeble? You cannot even be honest, you cannot be open with whom you are.\n \n I on the other hand have nothing to hide. And certainly not from some twisted interpretation you've divulged to try and minimize the meaning of my life, and my qualities as a person.\n \n \n You even posed as a Christian in your deceptive little fantasy to try to inject your debauchery into the faith. \n\n \n Actually false again. During those years and months leading to me becoming an Atheist, I struggled to find meaning in the religion. I struggled to truly \"believe\". But I couldn't because all of it didn't add up.\n \n The murders in the name of an angry god, the enslavement of people, the slaughter of women and children, all for some sick jealousy invoked by a \"voice\" these writers heard.\n \n If anything my conscience made me question my beliefs! If anything, it was my conscience that dared to seek the truth no matter how much it hurt. And it did. Imagine all you struggled with, to appease a belief that you now know to be a lie.\n \n The time wasted, the energy, the meaningless guilt associated with the damnation from all religions. The void it never filled, the emptiness sitting there Sunday after Sunday trying to grasp some sort of meaning from it.\n \n When in fact the only thing I was grasping was guilt. Guilt and shame manifested by the structure the church has to keep it's followers bound by fear, by guilt, by a feeling of utter worthlessness!\n \n TO believe your dead as a human since the day you were born! TO believe that you were infected by \"sin\" and have no escape no matter what you do in life! No matter you accomplishments, your merits, your strife!\n \n THAT is not freedom Easyrider. That is not salvation. The true salvation is casting away the shackles of the archaic. Tossing aside the weight of useless abandon trying to appease a being that simply isn't there.\n \n All this time the only people I was trying to appease were the church themselves. Their interpretations, their control which filtered down to my parents. I see now it is a sick form of indoctrinated lunacy that people exploit to take the best and worst qualities from people without question and those people accept without weighing anything in the realm of logic.\n \n The only thing I can compare it too is Nazism and Hitlers rise to power. He mesmerized, captivated, made it seem like people NEEDED him to be saved! And they followed. Followed right into the darkness of history.\n \n The same goes for the ancient Israelis and other cultures that performed unspeakable acts in the name of a \"god\". You think you are above people because you follow a book that you have twisted to suit your own guilt, your own shame.\n \n And you take that and strikes others with it in a sick way to appease your own demons and skeletons that haunt your every step. We all have a past Easy. Wishing it away and blaming others won't make that go away. \n \n \n \n \n \n But we saw through that in a New York minute.\n\n \n Who is we? No one here BUT you and perhaps Archie think alike on the same crazed parallel on this forum. IF anything, you think my Atheism is in tandem to my sexuality. It actually isn't. There are plenty of straight Atheists and plenty of Gay Christians.\n \n But of course someone as deeply shackled to archaic religion as yourself wouldn't understand that.\n \n \n \n \nYou're spiritually stunted. \n\n \n I am grounded in reality.\n \n \nEven Thomas Jefferson is on record as saying the precepts of Jesus are the purest he'd ever seen.\n\n \n A dead man. A man who never lived to see the miracles of the modern age! The miracles of science! True wonders that men of his time never even dreamed of seeing! \n \n Oh how blind you people really are...",

   " What I am not 100% convinced is that there is not something beyond what we know and understand, although I am 100% convinced that if there is, Christianity has nothing to do with it. \n\n \n I never as a critical thinking Atheist said 100% there is no god. I just think the possibility is that of finding a unicorn, or loch ness. Until I see evidence. True, valid, evidence and not some sun baked man's voices he here's I'll keep my stance.\n \n \n \n The Bible is at best a guess to find meaning and purpose to life, explain the nature of man and an attempt to place an authoritive figure above man to alieve his fears and control his more violent instincts. \n\n \n Wrong. The Bible even in and of itself is the account of human atrocity perpetrated by people who used an authoritative figure to control societies and commit unspeakable horrors upon others who didn't \"believe\" in their same god. \n \n It is a record and a lesson to modern man the danger, and very real threat of religion plunging us into the dark ages once again. You take a radical Islamic Fundamentalist and give him the horrors of nuclear weaponry, and you spell certain doom for our species. \n \n You give a radical Christian the same thing and it spells doom for our species. The point being, is that religion and radicalization from ANY faith can have damning consequences.\n \n Does this absolve Atheists from responsibility? Certainly not! Humans are humans. The only simple difference is that Atheists have no deity they can blame their actions upon. Do we have the potential to do such horrible acts? Certainly.\n \n But that comes down to human nature and lack of reason. It's called personal accountability. And the religious have none of it.\n \n \n \n It has had limited success and all said an done has probably caused more harm then good. \n\n \n The Crusades. The founding of the Torah and Islam which mindless conflict has been raging for centuries... Yeah you think?\n \n \n Knowledge without responsibility is more dangerous than than the lack of knowledge.\n\n \n I disagree. You see the leaders of such religions HAVE knowledge. They have power in their societies. And yet they keep the ignorant shackled to their dogma's, their guilt trips, their restrictions and primitive hellish laws keeping those bound by fear of either the eternal or the very real laws they indeed enforce.\n \n If you have knowledge there must be responsibility. However claiming an excuse or ignorance when you have such a thing is just a glaring flaw and something ignored by the person.\n \n \n If there can be a bright side we can only speculate that without religion to slow down progress that we would have been more cognizant of the repercussions of our actions and acted differently.\n\n \n Without religion we'd have no wars or conflicts. We'd put our money and efforts into science and the betterment of mankind instead of the billions wasted being funneled to churches wrestling for control over the minds of the utterly stupid and ignorant.\n \n \n \n With that perspective religion has served a purpose and still does, but it hasn't been managed well and is rapidly approaching a point where the cost is far to much to continue.\n\n \n The cost could mean the very damnation of our species and this planet.\n \n \n You address the Bible through the eyes of misguided Christians, much of it having been corrupted and the rest being misunderstood.\n\n \n I address it from a realistic standpoint. The truth of what the religion is at it's very core. You must realize I draw experiences from this as well as other insights as well, yet the very basic principle remains the same. Indoctrination is key for their power to hold on others.\n \n \n \n You know this but continue to accept it on their terms (by rejecting it because of their understanding is to accept they are right first) Not that it is true but if you take the position that it is possible and then look at what would be the point of the events that are described you can start to recognize parts that would make sense mixed in with the jibberish (mostly jibberish at this point though) keep what makes sense and lose the jibberish and it is a very different piece of work. It might still not be from God, but at least it has value for something other that for when you run out of paper towels.\n\n \n If you look for guidance or for meaning from this book good luck. I cannot omit one section like typical Christians do when I read glaringly in black and red the utter horrors unleashed upon fellow people all in the name of such a deity.\n \n It would be like reading Mein Kampf and finding one good sentence while ignoring the rest....

   "I never as a critical thinking Atheist said 100% there is no god. I just think the possibility is that of finding a unicorn, or loch ness. Until I see evidence. True, valid, evidence and not some sun baked man's voices he here's I'll keep my stance.\n\n \n Wasn't really looking to convert, just roughly where I stand\n \n \n \nWrong. The Bible even in and of itself is the account of human atrocity perpetrated by people who used an authoritative figure to control societies and commit unspeakable horrors upon others who didn't \"believe\" in their same god. \n\n \n People kill people, not books. To blame the Bible for it bad you must acknowledge it's good. If you want to negate it give responsibility to the people who use it to push their own agenda. As long as it is believed to have the power top compel it will have power.\n \n \n \nIt is a record and a lesson to modern man the danger, and very real threat of religion plunging us into the dark ages once again. You take a radical Islamic Fundamentalist and give him the horrors of nuclear weaponry, and you spell certain doom for our species.\n \n \n Remove religion and you have an unstable person looking for a reason. \n \n \nYou give a radical Christian the same thing and it spells doom for our species. The point being, is that religion and radicalization from ANY faith can have damning consequences.\n\n \n \n Remove religion and the world doesn't suddenly become Mr. Rogers Nieghborhood. We would just be at each others throats for some other reason. I am not sure but I think there was less religious violence when everybody had their own God rather than fighting over who spoke for the only God. \n \n \nDoes this absolve Atheists from responsibility? Certainly not! Humans are humans. The only simple difference is that Atheists have no deity they can blame their actions upon. Do we have the potential to do such horrible acts? Certainly.\n\n \n \n Athiests are just forced to be more creative when passing the buck.\n \n \nBut that comes down to human nature and lack of reason. It's called personal accountability. And the religious have none of it.\n\n \n They put everything on credit or lay away, the don't use cash.\n \n \n \n \nI disagree. You see the leaders of such religions HAVE knowledge. They have power in their societies. And yet they keep the ignorant shackled to their dogma's, their guilt trips, their restrictions and primitive hellish laws keeping those bound by fear of either the eternal or the very real laws they indeed enforce.\n\n \n I don't place manipulation up there as a gauge of knowledge, intellect maybe but it doesn't take a rocket scientists to get some poor uneducated, illiterate person who only knows one environment and it isn't hard to keep them there. I don't believe that most of the religious zealots are significantly smarter than the people who follow them\n \n \nIf you have knowledge there must be responsibility. However claiming an excuse or ignorance when you have such a thing is just a glaring flaw and something ignored by the person.\n\n \n Wisdom rationaizes this should be so but it isn't a requirement.\n \n \n \nWithout religion we'd have no wars or conflicts. We'd put our money and efforts into science and the betterment of mankind instead of the billions wasted being funneled to churches wrestling for control over the minds of the utterly stupid and ignorant.\n\n \n I thought that to once, but looking at our history we wage war and violence for many reasons pride, greed, power, glory and fear to name just the emotional reasons\n \n \n \nI address it from a realistic standpoint. The truth of what the religion is at it's very core. You must realize I draw experiences from this as well as other insights as well, yet the very basic principle remains the same. Indoctrination is key for their power to hold on others.\n\n \n That is scared people wanting to fell safe by making more people scared like them or seek validity through numbers\n \n \nIf you look for guidance or for meaning from this book good luck. I cannot omit one section like typical Christians do when I read glaringly in black and red the utter horrors unleashed upon fellow people all in the name of such a deity.\n\n \n You do it with a dictionary.\n \n \nIt would be like reading Mein Kampf and finding one good sentence while ignoring the rest.... THAT is the Bible.\n\n \n \n If it was a really good sentence maybe it was worth it. I have never read a book that I found to be useful or entertaining from cover to cover and I have read a lot of books.",

I can see why you wanted to distance yourself from your \"practicing homosexual\" argument but you have already tried this and went nowhere with it. Let's make it easy, sure let them get married. Now what? \n \n \nYou are using the same arguments against sibling marriage as was and sometimes is against homosexuality..child abuse.\n\n \n I used it along with several others. You may not have considered that there isn't any evidence to suggest that being gay makes one a pedophile. Enough people are aware that is false and so its use is decreasing. On the other hand child abuse is the primary result of incest. In the real world your two well adjusted sibiling love birds who seem only able to find love with each other doesn't happen. In the rare cases that involve adults there is emotional and psychological issues that require the term consent to be very broad in its meaning. \n \n There is no compelling reason not to raise the abuse objection when discussing the viability of incest, except it throws mud on your poster child couple that you have given every meaningful advantage that would not exist outside of your mind.\n \n \n \nIncestuous marriages obviously would not involve underage children so stop the strawman argument..it doesnt work.\n\n \n Well I guess a parent or gaurdian or even sibling could never spend years manipulating a child until they were an adult or of legal age to marry which I believe is as young as 16 in many states and less in a few. \n \n Maybe there is some as yet undiscovered genetic factor that makes certain people only attracted to a close relative. They were born with an overwhlming compulsion for their brother, sister or cousin. \n \n Maybe we should disregard also the emotional and psycholgical issues asociated with incest which are not part of being gay in any where near the same numbers\n \n \n \nThen because you cannot produce an argument against polygamy , you back pass it...classy.\n\n \n Are youo serious? You have jumped ship on your own arguments at least twice in just this thread and to remain consistant I don't care if one guy wants to and is able to manage with a couple of wives who also have no problem with it then run with it.

   "Niether can you disregard the emotional and psychological repercussion that exist in incest but not homosexuality. \n\n Sure I can. It was once claimed that homo-sexuality is both damage and damaging.\n \n The prejudgement of the original psychologists about what is natural is the only possible root of the conversion to the modern view on homo-sexuality.\n \n Just like the moose pointed out, when you think of incest you can only think of abuse and damage.\n \n Perhaps the only people who violate the taboo now are the ones so desperate that they are willing to be abusive or immoral.\n \n In ancient rome patricians raped their slaves both male and female, does that mean such is the only way homo-sexuality can exist?\n \n \nThe lack of consent is not restricted to rape. A parent or guardian has the ability to manipulate the children in their care. The obstacles that incest needs to overcome to exist in the same manner as homosexuality make a comparison difficult to be valid.\n\n Notice the controversy about homo-sexual parents. Can you not see that these 'normal' people see homo-sexuals as without moral dignity?\n \n Couldn't a homo-sexual parent manipulate adopted children?\n \n 'well they don't have any pedophilic urges just because their gay'\n \n Yet for incest this must be the case?\n \n \nIn that case it should be compared to heterosexuality as most cases do not involve same sex brothers and sisters. There is no biological attraction to a sibling beyond the normal male/female found in heterosexuals. There is only the emotional attachment as the driving factor in their choice.\n \n I am not quite getting this.\n \n There is strong emotion, whether by social influence or by biological property to NOT have sex with family members.\n \n Without that factor it would be unlikely that anyone would avoid having sex with family members. One trusts and knows family members far more and far earlier than anyone else in general.\n \n If you are saying that it is not sexual desire but emotional attachment that drives what incest we know about, I of course agree.\n \n When comparing on average the same sexual desire between two people, one you just met and one you have known your whole life one would normally expect the latter to win out most of the time.\n \n I don't expect incest to be a higher sexual attraction than typical heterosexual attraction. However just like in homo-sexuality is is far higher than 'the social norm' (or at least what it used to be). I don't think homo-sexuals claim to have stronger urges than hetero-sexuals either.\n \n As far as comparison, I am comparing incest to hetero-sexuality and hetero-sexuality to incest and the bestiality, I am in fact comparing them all to each other.\n \n \nWouldn't change the harm that comes from incest and isn't present in homosexuals, but I can be open to some as yet discovered traight that makes it like being homosexual.\n\n You aren't getting that, I don't trust psychologist verdict of 'always harmful'. If you are saying they were wrong once but right now, fine.\n \n What are you talking about undiscovered trait that makes it like being homo-sexual? It is not homo-sexuality, that is why it has a different name. I am comparing; comparing is not claiming two things are the same it is identifying what is the same and what is different.\n \n How in the world would anyone prove that incest or homo-sexuality is necessarily mentally damaging or necessarily the result of mental damage?\n \n \nIf it happens to be the unique scenario of two well adjusted consenting adults then the argument relies solely on the reproductive aspect which by itself isn't very strong, but incest goes into areas like pedophilia and those involved have a range of problems in coping with a normal life.\n\n No more than any other type of attraction. Pedophilia is not the same as incest. I have already said statistical overlap is no proof and hardly means much given the social forces involved.\n \n Such sexual deviants as do arise despite the strong social disapproval are bound to be the most intense kinds, possibly people who have mental damage; hence the statistical association.\n \n Again I call on history, homo-sexuality hardy had any poster children; I don't want to delve into the circumstances that brought about their social revolt but no one before then ever predicted that there are as many homo-sexuals as there are.\n \n People simply did not tell.\n \n The point being that you nor I can tell what situation is unique and one could (and no doubt have) said \"If it happens to be the unique scenario of two well adjusted consenting adults then the argument relies solely on the religious aspect which by itself isn't very strong, but homo-sexuality goes into areas like pedophilia and those involved have a range of problems in coping with a normal life\". You can't claim that no homo-sexual pedophile as ever existed.\n \n \nIncest is a deviation of orientation. There is no biological compulsion that drives the attraction only to family members.\n\n Alright... but I never said that incest must mean only attraction to family members. Bi-sexuals say they are attracted to men and women. \n \n I have heard of many cases where homo-sexual people get married to the opposite sex, have children all to 'pretend' to be hetero-sexual. They profess to emotionally love their wives/husbands yet still be sexually unattracted to them (and in fact never were).\n \n So it seems quite possible to have sex for emotional purposes and not merely because of lust.\n \n None of the above cases means that homo-sexuality - the attraction to the same sex doesn't exist.\n \n The point is that in the case of incest, a lack of attraction is the norm, so any serious sexual attraction is a modified or new sexual orientation.\n \n To say that only the normal hetero/homo attractions are involved is to already admit there is a deviation.\n \n \nThe attraction isn't even always sexually intended, and usually is an inability to make the distinction between affection, love and sex amoung other mental abnormalities.\n \n Usually, can you say always?\n \n Conservative mainstream culture claims that sex should only follow emotional love. They of course except incest but because they find that unnatural not because they claim families can't love each other :p\n \n Homo-sexuals along with hetero-sexuals routinely claim to emotionally love sex partners (marriage).\n \n I'll readily admit it is mental damage to be unable to make the distinction between affection, love, and sex; but you can't be claiming that it is mental damage to think that love and sex are related.\n \n The novelty in incest is the existance of sexual attraction, not love. The only way for incest to actually occur between consensual adults is for either both to be mentally unable to differentiate between sex and love (i.e. they 'think' the only way to show love is sex) or at least one is sexually attracted to the other.\n \n The chances of the former seem slim even given common family genes, and I seriously doubt you could prove that even a quarter of people with incestuous desire have this.\n \n Think about what you would need to do so. You would need to know the number of people with incestuous desires, you would need to know that the psychologist analyzing them isn't just slapping on 'they can't tell the difference' because he is assuming no sexual attraction could exist.\n \n Note that even if you can prove no sexual attraction exists in a given case, that does not mean the mentioned mental damage exists, they could be acting as they are neither out of sexual desire nor emotional imperative but merely for pleasure as some kind of extended masturbation.\n \n \nBottom line incest is not something we are born to. One may be born with the chemical imbalances or into the social/cultural environment that can induce incest but that is completly different than being formed specifically with those desires.\n\n Again, that sounds like the exact same situation as homo-sexuality. There are many who believe homo-sexuality is a genetic deformation of the sexual attraction mechanism. Homo-sexuals believe they are born to be the way they are, i.e. the desire is a biological consequence not a choice.\n \n So you saying that incestuous people aren't born that way but choose it perhaps because of chemical imbalance is exactly what 'normal' people have been saying about homo-sexuals for years.\n \n \nYou just seemed to have been trying to address the genetic problems that result from incest and which would only be prevented via the honor system which as you point out doesn't work very well.\n\n That is true, incestuous children would be much more vulnerable to genetic problems and that is no doubt why the taboo existed. Yet as I also pointed out: now that we can both control conception and predict dangerous genetic combinations it has become clear to us that such danger exists in more than just incestuous children and further can be prevented (in general) in all of them.\n \n As I said (and you seemed to accept) I only added this section because I didn't want some one coming back with:\n \n 'Yea but incest can ruin a child's life and not just the two consenting adults so it's not like homo-sexuality'.",

If you broaden your criteria enough you can compare them to driving and walking on the moon.\n\n True, but I am comparing only a few properties. The most important one being 'are all people involved consenting adults', that is what the moose, most HS think should be the primary criteria and I agree.\n \n There are two more I am comparing, how many adults are involved and are children possible.\n \n In Heterosexuality, Homosexuality, Bestiality, Polygamy, and Incest it is possible for all people involved to be consenting adults.\n \n In Heterosexuality, Homosexuality, Bestiality, Polygamy, and Incest can manifest in pedophilia but is not an essential component of any.\n \n In Incest, Heterosexuality, and Homosexuality there can be the famous 'two consenting adults'\n \n In Bestiality there is one consenting adult, making it the second resident of this category along with masturbation.\n \n In Polygamy there are more than two consenting adults.\n \n In Homosexuality and Bestiality there can be no children.\n \n If I were to make a chart...\n \n Incest can be heterosexual or homo-sexual, I would place it in between them then.\n \n Bestiality is closer to homo-sexuality because no children are possible so it would go on the homo side.\n \n Polygamy spans all.\n \n My chart would look like this:\n \n Heterosexual - Incest - Homosexual - Bestiality\n [--------------------Polygamy---------------]\n \n So it seems these are all quite comparable on the criteria usually touted.\n \n \nNobody is perfect and all test carry some degree of bias. If the evidence was falling half and half or there was very little of it then there would be some basis to question, There still is, but there is enough to make a responsible choice\n\n As there once was about gays? How many times do I have to tell you I am not buying statistical association.\n \n \nIS it one or the other or can it be both?\n\n It can be both, in fact all the above deviations can exist in one instance (sorry for the image).\n \n Something can be round and red without red implying round.\n \n Similarly a pedophile could be incestuous but incest does not imply pedophilia any more than HS or Hetero does.\n \n \nSo what let's make it ok so we can get a good count?\n\n I didn't say that.\n \n I am merely pointing out that as it stands you can't have good numbers so to speak.\n \n As I have said already it was once said that gays are mentally diseased. If you were back then and professionals were agreeing with religion which was agreeing with people's 'nasty' emotion no sane person would admit their HS. Again I am not sure how they managed it but they got out from under that.\n \n At this point even if psychologist stuck to their guns and said HS were poor sick people, no one would believe them.

   "I don't know how a discussion about the comparison between homosexuality and incest came about\n\n Well some people a while back were saying something a long the lines of 'someone isn't homo-sexual till they have sex with the same gender'. Such a proposition would necessitate that homo-sexuality is a choice. I commented that this proposition did not match the definition of homo-sexuality. The moose responded to me basically asking why it should matter if it's a choice. I said it matters because anyone who would want to morally condemn homosexuality needs to establish that it is a choice, there can be no right or wrong unless those two are alternatives to choose from.\n \n I also said (incest had already been mentioned) that it is important to explain the difference between other sexual deviations and homo-sexuality if one is claiming homo-sexuality isn't a choice.\n \n He said: \"You are stating that if one is to argue that homosexuality is a choice, one must also argue that bestiality and incest are a choice also. I don't see why that is so. I think if you want to compare homosexuality to anything, it is most appropriate to compare it to heterosexuality.\"\n \n He also said: \"I think it(homo-sexuality) is another part of the human condition and is not harmful to anyone else, so it should be compared to heterosexuality. When you examine it, it most closely compares to that: two consenting adults etc, etc. \"\n \n Now I of course couldn't resist this, not only did he kind of phase over the choice issue he also started to say I shouldn't compare homo-sexuality to bestiality or incest but only to heterosexuality... AND THEN stated that homo-sexuality was part of the human condition and was not harmful to anyone else implying several times that the 'not harmful to anyone else' was the standard to morally judge a orientation. Now as you probably know the moose's argument is hardly unique in fact it's pretty ubiquitous among people who defend homo-sexuality.\n \n I should hope it's clear I have no issues with homo-sexuality but I have serious issues with incomplete logic and tunnel vision on the conclusions of arguments. \n \n \nbut there is one thing that is true through all the sexual orientations. There will always be peope (straight, bi, gay, etc) that will lack common decency and do stupid stuff in inappropriate places and times.\n\n Indeed, and like I have been trying to tell pappillion you cannot condemn an entire sexual orientation for individual behavior. As always you may only do so if a certain behavior is necessary in said definition.",

In fact given that we have observed abuse isolated from incest to result in the same damage you are attributing to incest it seems likely that abuse is the active ingredient in the beaker. The experiment you could perform that would be analogous to A's experiment would be to isolate incest from abuse and see if it has the same results.\n \n \nScience takes scenarios and looks for what is common and factors the impact of events on a persons life. They then study when i happens x amount of people develop abcd characteristics and people efgh in similiar environments but lacking i develop jkl and so on and so on eventually being able to make a reasonable assertion that i either causes or significantly contributes to lmnop.\n\n And if efgh contributes to i and not the other way around?\n \n Confusing the cause is an extremely common fallacy, and it is caused because it's very tempting to pick out correlations. That's why science has experiments to develop correlations into known relations.\n \n If you have an abusive person, don't you think it's much more likely for them to abuse people they have control over?\n \n \nNo it won't. It would mean that specific instance was found to cause no measureable harm. A tumor sometimes is not cancer, that doesn't mean none of them are.\n\n And homo-sexuals along with hetero-sexuals sometimes abuse children, are sometimes damaged emotionally or damage emotionally. Should we start treating those orientations like tumors just waiting to turn ugly?\n \n \nI can imagine the tooth fairy looking like Tinkerbell, that does not mean my mother shrank and grew wings while I was asleep.\n\n Well we both know that is not how you used the term.\n \n \nBecause 500 just as credible names have found fault with their evidence.\n \n Not really, in fact it's more like 20,000 credible names have totally ignored their research.\n \n \nWhy put you in that position when this stemmed from is incest comparable to homosexuality?\n\n I am not sure what you mean here. Incest is comparable to homo-sexuality, as you noted you could compare homo-sexuality to the moon (you just wouldn't find any meaningful points) but homo-sexuality and in fact all sexual behavior can be compared on the same properties to other sexual behavior.\n \n \n But.. ... Doesn't claiming it to be harmful sufficient to qualify as attacking it directly?\n\n It would if you had provided an argument for that harm. i.e. I haven't had to defend incest because you haven't made an argument as to why it's harmful. I would necessarily need to know your premises before I could formulate a counter.\n \n \nIt isn't a contradiction to say it is the case all the time since I have never said it is. \n\n Well since you didn't have the scope on your statement on what incest is 'all about' I assumed they were universal, it seemed the only way they would be relevant.\n \n \nThe instances where it works out are a very small % and what benefit those few lose is not comparable to the harm condoning it would cause.\n \n % of known cases. The majority of known cases are cases of abuse, they should not even be considered data points. Throw out as well cases where mental damage or emotional trauma caused incest. It matters only if incest caused mental damage or emotional trauma, caused it itself not made worse the damage of abuse.\n \n The word condone implies that you are overlooking something wrong. Do you condone homo-sexuality?\n \n What harm do you claim would result in permitting incest? Do you imagine that such a position would weaken prosecution of abuse? That is absurd and you know it. Abuse is completely strong enough offense to carry through conviction as the countless cases of non-incestuous abuse prosecutions testify to.\n \n Do you imagine that a parent or sibling could control a younger person and get them to say it's consensual when it's not? Do not forget we aren't talking about children, you would be saying an 18 year old is being manipulated into this. Yet doesn't that exist already in great quantity in hetero-sexuality? How many abusive husbands hold psychological power over their spouses? How difficult is it to free them from this? How often does their refusal to tell the truth about their husbands hold back law enforcement? Yet grounds for abolishing marriage I think not. Besides which if an 18+ person is in an abusive incestuous relationship and won't admit it when incest is legal what makes you think anyone is ever going to find out about it now that incest is illegal? It seems the chances for discovery would be made higher just by legalizing it and opening the door for the situation to leak out in casual conversation.\n \n \nKilling someone can be good or bad. Most times it is bad and that bad can have degrees of how bad. The few instances where it is good doesn't contradict that or change the bad.\n\n I couldn't have said it better myself. Note how this point is a double edged blade. Killing someone can be good or bad. Most times it is bad and that bad can have degrees of how bad. The many instances where it is bad doesn't contradict that or change the good.\n \n Now of course I would like to make a small point that even though some killing is victimless it is all sad in a way and to be avoided, not nearly the case for sex.\n \n \nAlthough this wasn't about morality\n\n God, why are people so afraid of that word. It has a meaning you know. You can't talk about proper conduct without meaning morality.\n \n To say that homo-sexuality doesn't hurt anyone and therefore should be permitted is to say it is moral.\n \n \nyou would imply that actions can have no moral value or be morally independent. Because it doesn't mean they do does it mean they never do or can't? Is there circumstances that they do and others they don't? Would it be conditioned on the act?\n\n Since I had a long if somewhat fruitless discussion with you on my understanding of morality you might remember that I said that only actions can be moral or immoral, that those actions may need qualifications but that those qualifications are always static.\n \n Observe:\n \n Dropping a rock is a-moral\n \n Dropping a rock on someone who is not threatening and has not in the past proved threatening to your rights or the rights of others is immoral.\n \n Our language already kind of takes care of this 'problem', you can say that dropping a rock is immoral on some conditions or you could say that dropping a rock can be an instance of a category of immoral actions (damaging innocent people) I don't see that it really makes a difference. However when defining something immoral it is best to define the category (the latter).\n \n So having sex is a-moral\n \n having sex where you forced your partner physically or socially is immoral\n \n \nThe lack of consent is rape. Regardless of preference of victim. Consent either exists or it doesn't. Incest either occurs or it doesn't. The legality of the act can be different rape vs sexual assualt, but that is for determining punishment and responsibility.\n\n -<agree all\n -<\n \n Yet I wonder at the point, you asked for the difference between rape and incest. I said it was consent. You are saying ??\n \n \nOk sensitive subject matter now being discussed, moving right along.\n\n ... what?\n \n \nI see where this headed. You assume that all people are prepared to act in their best interest at all times and have the ability to know the results of the choices they make.\n\n Whoa, that is where we are headed? I have never assumed that as a rule; I have advocated it as an ideal but that is quite different.\n \n \nI am willing to bet the animals don't give consent\n\n hehe, I was wondering when you would get around to that. People always try incest first cause it seems easier. Well actually most people who aren't afraid of the subject just go straight to the 'unatural' argument and quoting the bible, but I mean among the people who want to try to defend homo-sexuality but not the deviations I mentioned.\n \n 1. Animals aren't people, even if some bestiality and normal people think of them that way.\n \n 2. I am willing to bet you are wrong on this point regardless\n \n \npolygamy if people really want to do that and can handle the logictics fine. It sets a bad tone, but maybe it will work out.\n\n No terrible harm here? Perhaps people can't recognize the nature of relationship or are obsessively social?\n \n \nIncest deals a lot with what has happened leading to attempts to stop what could happen.\n\n So people saw that the most heinous form of child abuse was incestuous child abuse and that justifies it's banishment?\n \n \nGun laws are in place not because everyone is irresponsible and will kill someone, but enough people have in the past to say laws need to be in place to protect people. \n\n A whole other can of worms pappillion, but are you sure you want that analogy? It seems to imply that you are against incest until such time as someone shows you that the majority of incestuous relationships have nothing wrong with them. A position that leaves you little ground to stand on given how little any of us know about what a permissible incestuous equilibrium would look like.\n \n \nAlso these can be in addition to not either or.\n\n ??\n \n Psychological Effects of Incest on Girls Focusing on Sibling Incest\n Did you read this?\n \n The first is - enforced secrecy. \"...sexualized contact which is kept secret due to fear, coercion, or threat cannot be considered harmless sex play.\" \n Enforced secrecy, as if it was taboo and illegal... Oh darn the coercion, fear, and threatening stuff again. That's right is mr. abuse.\n \n If she feels powerless or threatened, she just might submit \"to survive.\" \n The third aspect is the influence on sexual development. I, personally, find this aspect to be the most distasteful and the most damaging to the female. When the female's first sexual experience is with an older brother in a coercive, secret, powerless, guilt ridden atmosphere, that can form an imprint on her that can inhibit the development of a normal sexual identity. Guilt and shame can become identified with sexuality thus producing sexual dysfunctions ranging from painful intercourse to anxiety attacks to the abstinence of sex altogether. \n Guilt, secrecy, powerless coercion.\n \n Secrecy that allows coercion, the girls can't tell because they are ashamed. I don't buy this threatened XXXX. Older siblings are always trying to control younger, they don't go along with things they really don't want to unless there are other factors like not being able to tell parents.\n \n \"...prevailing notions suggest that if the experience occurs between young age-mates, if there is no betrayal of trust between the children, if it is a result of natural curiosity and experimentation, and if children are not traumatized by disapproving adults who discover their activity, the experience can be 'just another part of growing up'.\" (Forward & Buck, 1978, p. 85) (Canavan, 1992)I would claim that the above notion is sensible only when applying it to the traditional \"playing doctor\" games of very young children of the same age. But, I do not believe that it is sensible when applied too sibling incest between a several year older brother and younger sister.\n Some dissension among the ranks here. Forward & Buck seem to think damage need not always exist, even for children. What is the crucial factor of a big age difference? Coercive power he says.\n \n The same exists for all those cases of babysitters abusing their wards, is that incest? Yet it seems to cause the same negative effects, oh I just had this brilliant idea emoticon_idea maybe the damaging part is the coercive sexual abuse, maybe that's damaging no matter who is doing it, it's just more damaging when it's someone you should be able to trust.... Nah couldn't be.\n \n The Effects of Mother-Son Incest\n I couldn't help quoting some things:\n \"Each case (of mother son incest) came to the attention of the investigator either because the subject or his parent was involved in psychiatric treatment or had run into difficulties with the law. Thus, the cases are heavily weighted in favor of those who are having severe problems with their lives. Those who have engaged in mother-son incest and are doing quite well are naturally underrepresented in the sample. Thus, the images which these vignettes provide should be seen as rather crude outlines serving more to suggest directions of interpretation than as confirmation of any theoretical position\"\n \n Words of the article every single one.\n \n \"Lukiannowicz (1972) says that after two year incestuous relationship with his mother, a son eventually left home and married. He is said to have been 'normal'. Unfortunately, the word 'normal is not defined.\"\n I could not agree more about the word normal.\n \n \"Allen 1962 claims that after two years of observation there was no evidence of 'psychological harm' in a 12-year old boy who alcoholic mother enticed him to have intercourse. Again, the term 'psychological harm' is not clear.\"\n Ditto\n \n Oh and I couldn't help a little smirk at this one:\n \"Berry (1975) describes a 17 year old boy who came to treatment because of his anxiety about his homosexuality. According to this youth he shared his mothers bed during vacations and on a few occasions during his adolescence his mother examined his penis to 'see if it's growing properly' She insisted that he examine her exposed genitals once when he was 14. Berry claims that this youth initially saw his mother as very loving kind person but after a few years of treatment he saw her as a rather destructive influence on him. While he is said to have perceived himself as passive, helpless, and effeminate, there is no mention of regression or psychosis.\"\n No doubt his homo-sexuality forced his mother to try to correct him. Sound ridiculous? It is. So it seems merely association is not sufficient one must have a reason why there would be a causal relationship.\n \n The other cases are used in tandem to support the conclusion of the paper, that another psychologist who had said mother-son incest was damaging because it was too nice and made the sons never want to leave was wrong and that the cases cited were in fact abuses by the mother.\n \n Let me contrast one of your quotes with a portion of this paper's conclusion.\n \nThey(scientist) then study when i happens x amount of people develop abcd characteristics and people efgh in similar environments but lacking i develop jkl and so on and so on eventually being able to make a reasonable assertion that i either causes or significantly contributes to lmnop.\n\n \nOne is struck by two observations:.... and the extraordinary variety of responses... With regard to variability of responses to incest, it appears that having sex with one's mother does not trigger some kind of automatic process of regression or decompensation. The variability of responses to this exploitation results from how the son interprets this behavior. As summit and Kryso (1978) suggest, the primary harm resulting from incest is not the sex act itself, but the child's belief that this form of sexuality is inappropriate and exploitative.\n\n \n I'm not done, remember above when I said \"Throw out as well cases where mental damage or emotional trauma caused incest. It matters only if incest caused mental damage or emotional trauma, caused it itself not made worse the damage of abuse.\"\n \n \nWhile there are other document cases (Guttmacher, 1951; Shelton, 1975) of psychotics committing incest with thier mothers, this behavior occurred after the psychosis, in which case the incest is seen as resulting from the psychosis, not vice versa. ... sexual relations with the mother do not elicit fixed one dimensional response, it is the symbolic meanings which produce the response. \n\n \n \nHere is roughly 1.8 million others \n\n Here is 0.72 million about the evils of homosexuality\n \n After responding to your links, I would like to restate explicitly a point that should be abundantly clear by now. All those cases were about children, some childern with other childern, some childern with adults. They all were admittedly about abuse and even in some clearly abusive cases the interpertations of the victim saved them from damage. Why can't the damage of incest be identified without abuse?\n \n I have pointed out incest is no pedophillia, incest is not abuse, incest is not rape.\n \n I would also like to point another thing out, the idea that incest is emotionally motiveted by both parties to the exclusion of any sexual attraction seems to be utterly destroyed by both links and all their case studies as if it wasn't on the surface quite unreasonable.\n \n \nAs to why harm exists, Ask God. If it were up to me things would be different.\n\n Funny\n \n \nRelationships are more than just reproduction.\n\n and more than just lust.\n \n \nUmm not exactly but would it be better if I tried to defeat my argument? \n\n lol, sure but not by cherry picking. I think it's your responsibility to identify what factors caused the mistake about homosexuality in the field and why those factors no long effect official positions, say on incest and bestiality.",

   "\n \n \n I have to go but will address the rest shortly.\n \n \"All other major health professional organizations have supported the American Psychiatric Association in its declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder in 1973. Thus, the idea that homosexuality is a mental disorder or that the emergence of same-sex attraction and orientation among some adolescents is in any way abnormal or mentally unhealthy has no support among any mainstream health and mental health professional\n organizations.\"\n\n \n OK\n \n Just the Facts about Sexual Orientation & Youth: A Primer for Principals, Educators, & School Personnel\n \n \nWhat happened in 1973? Did the definition of mental disorder change? Unlikely. Did homo-sexuality change? Even more unlikely. What do you suppose happened? Perhaps the standard by which homosexuality was judged harmful were finaly realized to be circular and baseless? Far more liklely I think.\n\n \n You say that like that is a problem. \n \n As I have already pointed out changing positions based on new evidence does not mean you can disregard all the data in some other area. \n \n \nSo what is the definition of mental disorder? a mental or bodily condition marked primarily by sufficient disorganization of personality, mind, and emotions to seriously impair the normal psychological functioning of the individual-called also mental illness\n \n Ohh I see, looks like I was exactly right and it just seems to have everything to do with what ever 'normal psychological functioning' means.\n\n \n Are you saying that is an inadaquite definition? How would you define it so as to have no impact on incest?\n \n \n\"But he is also quick to qualify this. \"In over 100 years' worth of case studies I've looked at, I have never seen a single case of incest that has ended happily. I don't know a single experience where an incestuous relationship has been positive.\" He admits, however, that - by their very nature - psychiatrists don't attract happy, functional people. For example, the couple in the case cited by Dr Gabb, whose court transcripts suggest they had a perfectly happy life, would never have come to the attention of a mental health professional.\"\n\n \n Well let's look ar our consenting well adjusted young lady. At 22 she has been in a realtionship for 3 years and lives with her fiancee. She is upset because he accidently walked in on her having sex with another man and can't understand why he broke off the engagement as she believes it to be normal behavior. Notice I didn't even mention it was her biological father she was sleeping with. I wonder if she was over 18 the first time or at what age she approached him, or did he approach her. The article doesn't say, but does Mom know about this? Is it a secret to her and was she planing on continuing once she was married?\n \n Even though our good doctor contradicts himself, needing only 4 sentences in the same paragraph to do so. I will use the paragraph that follows yours above\n \n Kahr, drawing on his experience as a practising psychotherapist, raises some pertinent questions about any incidences of seemingly \"consensual\" incest. \"Even if, as in your friend Karen's case, she did, as she claims, initiate sexual contact with her father, what was lacking in her relationship with him so that sexual behaviour seemed the only way to bridge it? She may have been behaving sexually because she had failed to attract attention in any other way.\" \n \n Yep sounds like she has her act together. Now is incest to blame for this pillar of the family, maybe not but you bet it pretty obvious it's where your going to start looking to find out what it.\n \n \nWhat were gays? Among the most common stereotypes are those which carry fear and ignorance. Gays are said to be \"child molesters\" and \"sex-crazed maniacs\". They are considered extremely \"immoral\" because they do not follow social customs, \"unnatural\" because homosexuality violates the basic functions of genitals and contradicts the nature.\n\n \n The problem here is research study after research study found the these fears where unjustified, which is not the case for those engaging in incest. \n \n \nUntil the passing of the Sexual Offences Bill in 1967, male homosexual activity was illegal. Gay men were frequently imprisoned for consensual sex with another man.\n \n \n So much like how you portray incest couples, yet gays were able to make changes based on credible evidence a lot of which was done by people who wanted things to remain the same.\n \n \nLesbianism was not illegal, but was similarly subject to public disapproval, or ignored.\n\n \n Yep I bet it was. emoticon_xangel\n \n \nStonewall riots - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n How many homo-sexuals do you think were submiting themselves for psychological analyisis during that time? How many consenting incestous adults are doing so now?\n\n \n I would think enough to make a representitive sample. Then gays were taught something was wrong with them mentally, for those that would go that was the logical place to get treatment. \n \n \nI have made this point before but it just didn't seem to sink in. Incest is illegal, you don't have well adjusted couples throwing away their lives for the fun of being torn apart by psychologost before being sent to jail.\n\n \n And it is illegal for the reasons I have stated that you keep saying don't matter or are unfair. Thinking about it or even engaging as a minor with another minor isn't illegal (the minors can be, but even then not often prosecuted) so you are suggesting that there are not enough well adjusted normal couples practicing incest to make it ok there are only the bad ones which is kinda why it is illegal. Maybe there aren't as many good one's as you seems to think.\n \n \nThat doesn't stop these XXXXXX from pouring out babies apparently.\n \n There are very few reliable statistics about how often incest occurs. It's difficult to know how many people are affected by incest because many incest situations never get reported. There are many reasons that the victim might not report the abuse.\n\n \n \n Same with rape, child abuse and theft of inexpensive possessions, yet we are not blind to how often these occur. From cases where one is caught we can determine the minimum number of it's occurance what you describe prohibits knowing the maximum instances.",

How would you define it so as to have no impact on incest?\n\n It has no impact on incest except through perceptions of those who read it and define for themselves normal.\n \n I am saying that this definition is not very close to objective even if it doesn't allow total subjectivity. I present as evidence the fact that homo-sexuality was ever classed a disorder provided the extreme unlikeliness that homosexuality as a phenomenon has changed fundamentally in the past 20,000 years.\n \n \nWell let's look ar our consenting well adjusted young lady. At 22 she has been in a realtionship for 3 years and lives with her fiancee.

She may have been behaving sexually because she had failed to attract attention in any other way.\" \n\n May have been, well since you have such concrete evidence that will magically extend beyond this case I of course see your point.\n \n \nYep sounds like she has her act together. Now is incest to blame for this pillar of the family, maybe not but you bet it pretty obvious it's where your going to start looking to find out what it.\n\n I agree, you can learn about the disease from studying the symptoms, but you can't stop the disease by outlawing the symptoms, nor can you prove that the symptoms always indicate the disease.\n \n \nThe problem here is research study after research study found the these fears where unjustified, which is not the case for those engaging in incest.\n \n It is the case for incest, both your links and mine make it very clear that child molestation and sex maniacs are not necessary conditions for incest.\n \n \nSo much like how you portray incest couples, yet gays were able to make changes based on credible evidence a lot of which was done by people who wanted things to remain the same.\n\n So your arguing that if incest wasn't innately harmful it would have become legal by now?\n \n I do see the point but I don't think it's very strong, it is of the same nature as my point about the contradiction between psychological positions but to lesser degree.\n \n First off you can't say that it would be accepted by now if it was 'OK' like homosexuality has been (for the most part) unless you understand how homosexuality came to be accepted. Despite the way you are painting the picture it seems you have the order of events confused.\n \n You would have us think that at some point psychologist suddenly started doing case studies on homo-sexuals and found out to their surprise that homosexuality didn't cause any problems.\n \n That is not what happened. For the lifespan of the profession up till 1973 there had been psychologist doing about as many case studies on homosexuality as there are now for incest. They were not simply ignoring the idea they were labeling it harmful and destructive, a clear mental disorder.\n \n What changed in 1973 wasn't the evidence the psychologist had access to, it was the behavior and organization of the homo-sexual community. Riots and openness about the subject, the fact that homosexual people were willing to argue publicly for their mental health is what started the process. It was only after this revolt and 'coming out of the shadows' did the official position give way. Yes they had more case studies and more accurate case studies, but that was because homosexuals were losing their fear. The change occurred in the general population of open minded people first and then permeated the medical profession.\n \n So the question is not 'why haven't the psychologist given incest a pass', it's 'why haven't incestuous people revolted like the homosexuals'.\n \n That question I think I can answer although it is speculation as like I keep pointing out data is scarce. I think for one the sum of incestuous occurrences, desire, not just act are far far smaller than homosexual ones.\n \n I think the healthiest (and thus least likely to be discovered) form of incest is not exclusive but exists for a small time. The reason for this being that the motivation is curiosity at younger ages or as you said a wish to express emotion at later ones. However well adjusted, mentally stable people would certainly not carry on given that a normal heterosexual relationship would be socially acceptable. i.e. the common healthy form of incest is not exclusive in the least.\n \n Like the example of the 22 year old lady. Had she not cheated on her boyfriend it is not likely anything would have been discovered. As you pointed out 3 years of co-habitation and her mental stability was not questioned by her boyfreind. Again unfaithful polygamy not incest seems to have stolen the wings from this example against incest. You yourself implied such was the case by intentionally not mentioning that the person she was cheating with was her father. You indicated that it was the cheating not the father that was harmful.\n \n So there are less incestuous people than homosexuals, they are actively incestuous for far less time. Like you said they don't only have sexual attraction to family members so why start a revolt when they can have a nice respectable life in an accepted relationship and never bring up the fact that they were sexually attracted to family members.\n \n That is not the case for homosexuals, they had to be accepted for what they were or give up any hope of accepted relationships.\n \n There is two more factors that contribute to the lack of revolt I think. First is that so many cases of incest are associated with abuse. This is not because incest is necessarily abusive but in fact the other way around. Those who are willing to abuse children are probably evenly distributed among parents, older siblings, and random strangers; however parents and older siblings have orders of magnitude more opportunity and chances of getting away with it than others. Prospective revolters no doubt fear accusations of abuse and unlike homosexuals have little in the way of alibi.e. they could deny it but they couldn't point to something like 'we met each other at 25'.\n \n Finally and most effectively I really think the 'nasty' emotion is strong to incest than to homosexuality. Perhaps it is equivalent to what it used to be for homosexuality but now that so many people accept it people could hardly be so disgusted they were ready to start shooting people and remain sane.\n \n \nI would think enough to make a representitive sample. Then gays were taught something was wrong with them mentally, for those that would go that was the logical place to get treatment. \n\n Then the representative sample indicated that something was wrong with homosexuals because this was before it was declassified as such.\n \n \nAnd it is illegal for the reasons I have stated that you keep saying don't matter or are unfair.\n\n In my opinion pappillion, your response was a massive dodge. Have you nothing to say about my analysis of the links that have been brought up in this thread?\n \n Don't matter and unfair are the same things here. What I have been saying is that the connections being made are irrational, and unlike say donating blood this has to do with people's rights.\n \n \nso you are suggesting that there are not enough well adjusted normal couples practicing incest to make it ok there are only the bad ones which is kinda why it is illegal. Maybe there aren't as many good one's as you seems to think.\n\n I am suggesting that:\n A. The number of normal well adjusted couples that might exist should it be legal or accepted is vastly greater than the number that exist now.\n B. The number that exist now are almost entirely unknown.\n C. As a result of A and B and also factors I have mentioned above the ratio with abusive manifestations is orders of magnitude greater than accepted orientations because those who break the taboo for the most part do so because they are mentally unable to comprehend any rules and reject them all (mental damage)\n \n The situation with homosexuals was similar before it's rise which supports C.\n \n I am stating that:\n 1. No matter what the ratio between abusive and non-abusive incest it is the duty of the law to identify offenses not by things that often accompany them but by themselves. If 99% of incest (hypothetical number) was abusive, than 99% of incest would be illegal, but not because 99% of incest seems to be bad; because 100% of abuse is.\n \n 2. (corollary) It is incorrect to claim that something is inherently wrong but accept that it's definition doesn't warrant that. If incest was indistinguishable from abuse it's definition would match abuse. It's definition doesn't even contain a note about statistical relationships.\n \n 3. (corollary) If one accepts that sexual behavior is to be judged by the standard of consent, and incest may exist within those bounds; then incest may be consider acceptable by that standard. Anyone who refuses to accept this must either thing that for some reason incest can never be consensual or does not accept that sexual behavior is to be judged by consent. That standard was a premise of my whole argument. If someone was to argue that the standard of sexual behavior was the general feelings about how much harm it caused; homosexuality would never have risen to acceptance.\n \n \nSame with rape, child abuse and theft of inexpensive possessions, yet we are not blind to how often these occur. From cases where one is caught we can determine the minimum number of it's occurance what you describe prohibits knowing the maximum instances.\n\n This is a subtle fallacy of complex question. I am not suggesting that we count up all the cases of incest and only condemn it if it's above a certain amount on the justification that at that point all the little 'evils' are now 'too evil' and must be outlawed.\n \n Rape, child abuse, and theft are all wrong. Morally unacceptable.

   "The problem is not new evidence it's old evidence, specifically a lack of.\n\n \n The problem is not enough evidence you like. What if 10, 20, 100 additional studies were done and 80% reached conclusions consistent with previous research. Would you suddenly say that is enough for you or how many, ballpark, would be enough for you to say OK?\n \n \nIt has no impact on incest except through perceptions of those who read it and define for themselves normal.\n\n \n Diagnosis by medical professionals have criteria it is not some arbitrary after thought made by an individual. \n \n \nI am saying that this definition is not very close to objective even if it doesn't allow total subjectivity. I present as evidence the fact that homo-sexuality was ever classed a disorder provided the extreme unlikeliness that homosexuality as a phenomenon has changed fundamentally in the past 20,000 years.\n\n \n It was officially listed in 1952 for the 1st time as a sociopath personality disorder.\n \n \nWell adjusted I think not but there are many people I don't think are well adjusted. I am not going to throw them or for that matter women who cheat on their boyfriends into insane asylums.\n\n \n Women will be pleased to know that. I am also glad your in the position to make a judgment call on who is well adjusted but those who actually went to a school to learn about such things are not. Unless you happen to be one of those, either way a lot of your argument relies on the credibility of research done and the lack of what you feel is the correct research. You can't cherry pick participants for study. Yes they should get relevant participants and I am pretty confident that researchers are aware of these problems and take them into consideration.\n \n \nShe was consenting and that is all that my argument requires.\n\n \n Are you intentionally missing the point? I am pretty sure your smart enough to have seen it. \n \n Was she forced no. Other than that a conclusion I don't know is possible. She exhibits self destructive behavior for which she expresses no remorse for the suffering she causes someone she was going to marry and takes no responsibility for her actions but rather defends them as acceptable. Becoming angry that the fianc\u00e9e finds reason to disagree. The questions about why it was kept a secret, when was the first time? What was the reason for it to begin? Does the mother know? Why would the father continue with her getting married? Should we think on her 18th birthday when day asked what do you want she purred just you daddy, to which he said only because I love you?\n \n \nMay have been, well since you have such concrete evidence that will magically extend beyond this case I of course see your point.\n\n \n I see your evidence isn't quite so credible when it doesn't support your position.\n \n \nI agree, you can learn about the disease from studying the symptoms, but you can't stop the disease by outlawing the symptoms, nor can you prove that the symptoms always indicate the disease.\n\n \n Well first we take measures to not catch the disease, some of which are inconvenient even painful. When we do catch it we typically do all we can to eradicate it. \n \n \nIt is the case for incest, both your links and mine make it very clear that child molestation and sex maniacs are not necessary conditions for incest.\n\n \n Only to the degree that incest can be between adults. Otherwise yes it is kind of necessary. Sex maniacs are what?\n \n \n \nSo your arguing that if incest wasn't innately harmful it would have become legal by now?\n\n \n No, but if it wasn't it would probably not be viewed the same way.\n \n \nI do see the point but I don't think it's very strong, it is of the same nature as my point about the contradiction between psychological positions but to lesser degree.\n \n First off you can't say that it would be accepted by now if it was 'OK' like homosexuality has been (for the most part) unless you understand how homosexuality came to be accepted. Despite the way you are painting the picture it seems you have the order of events confused.\n\n \n I think I am in pretty much in the right order.\n \n \nYou would have us think that at some point psychologist suddenly started doing case studies on homo-sexual and found out to their surprise that homosexuality didn't cause any problems.\n\n \n In a sense yes. Limited research had been going on since before the establishment of modern psychology. When it was put into the initial publication of the DSM ni 1952 that started a wave of research in which almost every idea concerning gays was found to be wrong. Which was not hard to do since there wasn't very much of it.\n \n \n \nThat is not what happened. For the lifespan of the profession up till 1973 there had been psychologist doing about as many case studies on homosexuality as there are now for incest. They were not simply ignoring the idea they were labeling it harmful and destructive, a clear mental disorder.\n\n \n \n Modern psychology began in the later half of the 1800's and there was not a lot of research done one gays. I don't know on incest but how many were done on each? And no not all of them were concluding gays had a mental disorder, some were actually worse, but a lot had positive findings.\n \n \nWhat changed in 1973 wasn't the evidence the psychologist had access to, it was the behavior and organization of the homo-sexual community. Riots and openness about the subject, the fact that homosexual people were willing to argue publicly for their mental health is what started the process. It was only after this revolt and 'coming out of the shadows' did the official position give way. Yes they had more case studies and more accurate case studies, but that was because homosexuals were losing their fear. The change occurred in the general population of open minded people first and then permeated the medical profession.\n\n \n It was both, but without the evidence to support it gays would still be in the DSM. The riots occurred after removal from the DSM and new evidence is what prompted scientists to evaluate and change the perception. Not everybody and gay activists contributed greatly, but remember gay activist had a very different profile in the 50's 60's and 70's. \n \n \nSo the question is not 'why haven't the psychologist given incest a pass', it's 'why haven't incestuous people revolted like the homosexuals'.\n\n \n Because there isn't any credible evidence that can overcome all the negative data. \n \n\n That question I think I can answer although it is speculation as like I keep pointing out data is scarce. I think for one the sum of incestuous occurrences, desire, not just act are far far smaller than homosexual ones.\n \n I think the healthiest (and thus least likely to be discovered) form of incest is not exclusive but exists for a small time. The reason for this being that the motivation is curiosity at younger ages or as you said a wish to express emotion at later ones. However well adjusted, mentally stable people would certainly not carry on given that a normal heterosexual relationship would be socially acceptable. i.e. the common healthy form of incest is not exclusive in the least.\n\n \n Yes I am glad you agree.\n \n \nLike the example of the 22 year old lady. Had she not cheated on her boyfriend it is not likely anything would have been discovered. As you pointed out 3 years of co-habitation and her mental stability was not questioned by her boyfriend. Again unfaithful polygamy not incest seems to have stolen the wings from this example against incest. You yourself implied such was the case by intentionally not mentioning that the person she was cheating with was her father. You indicated that it was the cheating not the father that was harmful.\n\n \n \n I went into some detail earlier about this girl. The questions left unanswered would have shed light on whether incest played a role in her development. You can't say it was just cheating and incest had nothing to do with it, Just as I have been careful not to say it has, but all things considered it's in the top 3 of possibilities. She wasn't looking at websites for swingers, she wasn't looking for an open relationship, but something similar to why battered wives stay with and sometimes even defend their abuser she could not have been thought to be acting rationally? \n \n You seem to want to portray mental stability and mental disorder as having some physically noticeable effects, which is not true.\n \n \nSo there are less incestuous people than homosexuals, they are actively incestuous for far less time. Like you said they don't only have sexual attraction to family members so why start a revolt when they can have a nice respectable life in an accepted relationship and never bring up the fact that they were sexually attracted to family members.\n \n That is not the case for homosexuals, they had to be accepted for what they were or give up any hope of accepted relationships.\n \n There is two more factors that contribute to the lack of revolt I think. First is that so many cases of incest are associated with abuse. This is not because incest is necessarily abusive but in fact the other way around. Those who are willing to abuse children are probably evenly distributed among parents, older siblings, and random strangers; however parents and older siblings have orders of magnitude more opportunity and chances of getting away with it than others. Prospective revolter's no doubt fear accusations of abuse and unlike homosexuals have little in the way of alibi.e. they could deny it but they couldn't point to something like 'we met each other at 25'.\n \n Finally and most effectively I really think the 'nasty' emotion is strong to incest than to homosexuality. Perhaps it is equivalent to what it used to be for homosexuality but now that so many people accept it people could hardly be so disgusted they were ready to start shooting people and remain sane.\n\n \n Again I am glad you see this, but wonder how you maintain your position, until I thought about it and thern it was pretty clear.\n \n \nThen the representative sample indicated that something was wrong with homosexuals because this was before it was declassified as such.\n\n \n There were those just as today who would try a degay a person. They would use shock therepy and other methods of what in a non medical setting is called torture. Of course there were people who said it was wrong same as today and there are those who buy into it both then and now. \n \n I am not sure if it is every minute but enough are born to keep the idea alive.\n \n \nIn my opinion pappillion, your response was a massive dodge. Have you nothing to say about my analysis of the links that have been brought up in this thread?\n\n \n Me? Your kidding? You pick half a sentence to respond to leaving the rest out. You come back with stretches of the imagination tucked inbetween guesstimates and facts and laugh off what remains. I have responded to everything you have posted without picking the pieces I like. Why do you think my responses are as long as they are?\n \n \nDon't matter and unfair are the same things here. What I have been saying is that the connections being made are irrational, and unlike say donating blood this has to do with people's rights.\n\n \n Ding Ding Ding Ladies and Gentlemen we have a winner!\n \n Nobody likes being told they can't do something, especially when they would like to, nor does anyone enjoy when other peoples actions are the cause of that prohibition.(Well Christians seem to not mind, but that is a different topic) There also exist or at least could be understood that by doing so that there is an implication of being guilty of something before having acted. \n \n But this is one of those rare circumstances where the harm potential warrants the benifit loss. Like blood donation testing and screening reduces the odds of transmission to I think it was 3 in a million which a great and save thousands of lives except to those 3. They would disagree and I would not want to be one of them even though I support what could make them that stat. \n \n The bottom line whether suffucient for you or not evidence does exist. Research has been done and one adults with adults and there hasn't been anything that has survived peer review to make people rethink the position on incest. \n \n There are plenty of dumb people out there who will go with whatever direction the wind blows but there are plenty of people smart enough to go with the evidence. That will be the real game changer.\n \n \n \nI am suggesting that:\n A. The number of normal well adjusted couples that might exist should it be legal or accepted is vastly greater than the number that exist now.\n B. The number that exist now are almost entirely unknown.\n C. As a result of A and B and also factors I have mentioned above the ratio with abusive manifestations is orders of magnitude greater than accepted orientations because those who break the taboo for the most part do so because they are mentally unable to comprehend any rules and reject them all (mental damage)\n\n \n You keep making this assumption that more of the right research will make your case, but that is an unknown. You have to deal with what we have not what we might get and if it might prove favorable.\n \n \nThe situation with homosexuals was similar before it's rise which supports C.\n\n \n No because people thinking it was something it wasn't doesn't make it so until they changes their mind. You can only speculate that further research will conclude differently.\n \n \n I am stating that:\n \n1. No matter what the ratio between abusive and non-abusive incest it is the duty of the law to identify offenses not by things that often accompany them but by themselves. If 99% of incest (hypothetical number) was abusive, than 99% of incest would be illegal, but not because 99% of incest seems to be bad; because 100% of abuse is.\n\n \n So is 100% of incest\n \n \n \n2. (corollary) It is incorrect to claim that something is inherently wrong but accept that it's definition doesn't warrant that. If incest was indistinguishable from abuse it's definition would match abuse. It's definition doesn't even contain a note about statistical relationships.\n\n \n The defination of abuse is much broader in scope than that of incest which includes specific people involved. A dad does the neibor he is a pedaphile his daughter and it's incest, they acts are the same it is just who is invoved that is different. Same concept if he marries.\n \n \n3. (corollary) If one accepts that sexual behavior is to be judged by the standard of consent,\n \n \n The standard by which consent is considered valid and without coercion is significant. Like my example of battered wives, they could leave, but don't. Are they consenting to stay or is something else compelling them to do what is against their best interest?\n \n \nand incest may exist within those bounds; then incest may be consider acceptable by that standard. Anyone who refuses to accept this must either thing that for some reason incest can never be consensual or does not accept that sexual behavior is to be judged by consent. That standard was a premise of my whole argument. If someone was to argue that the standard of sexual behavior was the general feelings about how much harm it caused; homosexuality would never have risen to acceptance.\n\n \n You assume the standard of sexual behavior is accurate. If it isn't then it is it not justified in changing. Whay also must it be one or the other both are possibilities as well.\n \n \n This is a subtle fallacy of complex question. I am not suggesting that we count up all the cases of incest and only condemn it if it's above a certain amount on the justification that at that point all the little 'evils' are now 'too evil' and must be outlawed.\n \n Rape, child abuse, and theft are all wrong. Morally unacceptable. We do not need to know how much they occur to know this, our knowledge of this ought to be totally independent of their prevalence.\n \n \nRape would be wrong if it happened once a year or once a hour.\n \n What we do not know about, what is relevant (at least you seem to think so) is how many cases of incest are associated with abuse. You seem to proceed on the premise that if some subjective percentage is reached condemnation is justified.\n\n \n \n No you were going on about the numbers, how often and how many times and not enough which was what was behind the response.\n \n \nIf you wanted to use your analogy of theft of inexpensive items it would be like this:\n \n 95% of people who steal inexpensive items have cars. Given this it is clear that cars cause the theft of inexpensive items and owning a car is immoral.\n\n \n Thank God an argument has to show at least some common sense otherwise you may have a point here, but the fact that it is absurd negates the effectiveness and the validity of it being an example.\n \n \nMy objection about how much we know would be like 'yes but if we knew about more cases of inexpensive theft it could be revealed that only 80% of people who steal these things have cars'.\n\n \n And if that 95% represented 5% of people who own cars that don't steal inexpensive items then your findings have a problem and you need to look for another cause.\n \n \nIt could be valid (on the original subject) but it doesn't really matter to the fact that cars have nothing to do with theft on their own definitions, and that it is irrational to try to connect the two when one simply does not imply the latter.\n\n \n By the way of the examples I gave you pick the one meant for sarcasm to try an make a point.\n \n Yes it would be irrational to say cars cause crime and that is why I didn't but you can't take an absurd argument compare it to another and then suggest because one is they both are.",

The problem is none(or very few) of the objective studies are concluding incest is inherently damaging, they are concluding abuse when combined with betrayal and socially pressured guilt all at a young age is significantly more damaging than abuse otherwise.\n \n That doesn't even contradict my position, anyone could have predicted such results easily.\n \n \nDiagnosis by medical professionals have criteria it is not some arbitrary after thought made by an individual. \n\n I do not deny this but I do doubt it if that makes any sense.

Why would the father continue with her getting married? Should we think on her 18th birthday when day asked what do you want she purred just you daddy, to which he said only because I love you?\n\n Apparently I am not smart enough to see it. She was consenting, that she behaved with inappropriate polygamy seems to me irrelavant. We cannot proceed on the standard that we are allowed to outlaw things that tend to ruin families (not to say incest is one of those things). We would outlaw divorce tomorrow.\n \n The constant thread in the catholic position on sex and family is the preservation of the family unit at all costs. I know you are a subjectivist but will you at least admit that you are advocating some compromise between their extreme and total liberty?\n \n You want to allow certain things that tend to harm families, ruin relationships, hurt people but if at some point you think the scales tip then it's alright to outlaw it as too harmful.\n \n Your missing the common thread in my camp though. You don't have a right to outlaw divorce because you can't force people to stay together just like you can't force them to stay apart.\n \n If people destroy themselves it is terrible but it is their fault. Take drugs for instance, they are illegal but alcohol isn't. The only reason why alcohol remains while drugs like marijuana don't is social inertia. Those who enacted prohibition used the exact same arguments about 'protecting people from themselves' as you seem to be using now.\n \n \nI see your evidence isn't quite so credible when it doesn't support your position.\n\n It's hearsay on a speculation. I don't think we should get too fussy about this point because I am absolutely sure you could find some paper which no reservations damns all incest.\n \n What I find interesting is the way that reservations are being made, that many of my points are supported by links we have contributed. So even your ironclad appeal to authority is seeming not so hard. The experts don't all agree and so far they corroborated my observations about case studies and the nature of the damage causing elements.\n \n \nWell first we take measures to not catch the disease, some of which are inconvenient even painful. When we do catch it we typically do all we can to eradicate it. \n\n No matter how much decongestant you take you will not stop an infection that would take place. In fact you might make it worse.\n \n You are saying that by outlawing incest we can stop or minimize the mental disorders that cause some incest. It doesn't follow.\n \n \nOnly to the degree that incest can be between adults. Otherwise yes it is kind of necessary. \n\n Well as the article you linked to noted from previous research some believe that between two young people (of about the same age) no abuse is necessarily involved.\n \n So what are you saying? Many people are adults.\n \nSex maniacs are what?\n\n \"someone who always thinks about sex and tries to start sexual relationships with people\" is the only definition I could find.\n \n \nNo, but if it wasn't it would probably not be viewed the same way.\n\n So you admit your arguments based on how incest is viewed?\n \n \nIn a sense yes.

Oh and I suppose the gay rights movement resulted from the research that would be carried out after they had already started :p\n \n \nIt was both, but without the evidence to support it gays would still be in the DSM. \n\n Evidence for either position is forthcoming when the analyist gets to decide whether the evidence means your a nut job or normal.\n \n \n\n The riots occurred after removal from the DSM and new evidence is what prompted scientists to evaluate and change the perception.\n\n Not the one I linked to.\n \n \nNot everybody and gay activists contributed greatly, but remember gay activist had a very different profile in the 50's 60's and 70's. \n\n Yea, in prison.\n \n \nBecause there isn't any credible evidence that can overcome all the negative data. \n\n There isn't any credible negative data.\n \n \nI went into some detail earlier about this girl.

Heterosexual urges? Shouldn't we outlaw polygamy?\n \n \nYou seem to want to portray mental stability and mental disorder as having some physically noticeable effects, which is not true.\n\n Behaviorally noticeable effects certainly.\n \n \nAgain I am glad you see this, but wonder how you maintain your position, until I thought about it and thern it was pretty clear.\n\n ...\n \n \nThere were those just as today who would try a degay a person.

Of course there were people who said it was wrong same as today and there are those who buy into it both then and now. \n\n Except now the degayers are kooks and then they were the same united objective front of scientist who are now condemning incest and bestiality.\n \n If you are looking for me to try to claim no one knew the truth back then, that is of course ridiculous; there have always in history been people of integrity who would not corrupt their vision of the truth.\n \n but then from your own links it seems like at least some psychologist disagree that even patently abusive incest is necessarily harmful much less non-abusive incest.\n \n \nMe? Your kidding? You pick half a sentence to respond to leaving the rest out. You come back with stretches of the imagination tucked inbetween guesstimates and facts and laugh off what remains. I have responded to everything you have posted without picking the pieces I like. Why do you think my responses are as long as they are?\n\n You did not respond to my analysis of the links you provided. From where I am standing it looks like you just googled 'effects of incest' skimmed the first paragraph to make sure it was a negative account and then posted it. It doesn't seem like you actually want to get into the reasoning or observations at all. I think we can both agree that the evidence that incest is necessarily damaging is at the heart of this section of the debate so it seemed to me like you just kind of ignored the most important part of my post.\n \n \nDing Ding Ding Ladies and Gentlemen we have a winner!\n \n Nobody likes being told they can't do something, especially when they would like to, nor does anyone enjoy when other peoples actions are the cause of that prohibition.(Well Christians seem to not mind, but that is a different topic) There also exist or at least could be understood that by doing so that there is an implication of being guilty of something before having acted. \n \n But this is one of those rare circumstances where the harm potential warrants the benifit loss.

That will be the real game changer.\n\n Well the winner didn't seem to do it's job quite yet. You might have missed the part where I said 'unlike blood donation'.\n \n No one has a right to donate blood, but no one has the right to stop people from having sex either.\n \n I want to focus in on the core of your paragraph. \"this is one of those rare circumstances where the harm potential warrants the benefit loss.\"\n \n The benefit loss you seem to identify is people 'not liking to be told what to do', where the potential harm is ? I asked you about this before; what is the potential harm. You didn't answer.\n \n This benefit you are talking about losing is called liberty, the right to decide what you do with yourself and your life.\n \n The standard you setup here is clearly \"if enough smart people think something is risky, then the benefit of liberty must be sacrificed\"\n \n As with all subjectivist positions it is extremely vulnerable to temporal comparison as it is necessarily tied to the current social construct.\n \n So, when homosexuality was illegal and a mental disease; was gay sex a benefit that had to be sacrificed for the greater good, or were the 'smart people', 'not smart enough'?\n \n In other words if you grant to anyone the ability to suspend rights you cannot maintain that rights are static, they must then be subjective; in which case gays really didn't have the right to be gays until society told them they could be. Any homosexuals here want to comment on that idea?\n \n \nYou keep making this assumption that more of the right research will make your case, but that is an unknown. You have to deal with what we have not what we might get and if it might prove favorable.\n\n That is a complete mischaracterization. I keep making the assumption that healthier incest would be discovered to be much more prevalent then it is now should it become legal.\n \n However I maintain that there is no negative evidence to overcome, the blanket of ignorance about the proportions of incestuous manifestations is not required at all to come to conclusions about incest in general. I do not await new research to validate my conclusions.\n \n What I am arguing against is the misplacement of casual relationship that you and perhaps others (although not the people who wrote the articles I analyzed) are carrying out.\n \n You research incest and you get a lot of cases of abuse, you find the abuse is much worse in incest than otherwise.\n \n You have not concluded that incest is damaging in of itself. It doesn't matter how many such studies exists, a sum of zeros is zero.\n \n I do not rely on any future numbers at all. In fact I doubt incest will ever be that common legal or not because in most people the anti-incest mechanism works just fine.\n \n If incest were legal and 90% of incest was still damaging abuse that would show that the current ratios are accurate, but my point would hold if not my speculations.\n \n \nNo because people thinking it was something it wasn't doesn't make it so until they changes their mind. \n\n Precisely, yet the situation was the same. The known cases of homosexuality overrepresented child abuse and mental damage by several orders of magnitude in those times.\n \n \nSo is 100% of incest\n\n Support\n \n \nThe defination of abuse is much broader in scope than that of incest which includes specific people involved. A dad does the neibor he is a pedaphile his daughter and it's incest, they acts are the same it is just who is invoved that is different. Same concept if he marries.\n\n If he 'does' his daughter it's incest and pedophilia and almost certainly abuse. It is also certainly heterosexual. We do not just spin the blame wheel to see if it will land on heterosexuality, pedophilia, incest or abuse. We ought to be looking the the critical causal relationships (as the concepts are defined) to determine what is coincidental association and what really matters to why this sum is damaging.\n \n \nThe standard by which consent is considered valid and without coercion is significant. Like my example of battered wives, they could leave, but don't. Are they consenting to stay or is something else compelling them to do what is against their best interest?\n\n Both. That they are consenting is why the police can't arrest the husband. That they are being compelled by psychological damage (caused by the abuse) to continue to choose the status quo is why there is a problem.\n \n Good example. Why is it that no one has trouble understanding the elements in these cases? The police don't start talking about outlawing heterosexual sex even though 100% of these situations contain it.\n \n They seem to somehow figure out that abuse not sex qua sex is the problem in these cases.\n \n \nYou assume the standard of sexual behavior is accurate. If it isn't then it is it not justified in changing.\n\n Which one, consent or social?\n \n I know consent is accurate from my reasoning on morality, I know social is not always correct from the treatment of gays.\n \n \nWhay also must it be one or the other both are possibilities as well.\n\n The social consensus could be that consent is the standard by which to judge sexual orientations so it could be both in reality. However in logic one must choose in between them merely for the possibility that they could be different. You really need to stop getting hung up on irrelevant coincidences. 8 is an infinity sign turned sidewards, don't freak out when you see 8 and infinity in the same equation.\n \n \nNo you were going on about the numbers, how often and how many times and not enough which was what was behind the response.\n\n Only because that is your argument as far as I can tell. Forgive me for not totally ignoring your points.\n \n \nAnd if that 95% represented 5% of people who own cars that don't steal inexpensive items then your findings have a problem and you need to look for another cause.\n\n Alright, what percentage of all sexual abuse is incest?\n \n \nBy the way of the examples I gave you pick the one meant for sarcasm to try an make a point.\n\n I am sorry, I thought you picked it because you wanted an analogy outside of sexuality.\n \n \nYes it would be irrational to say cars cause crime and that is why I didn't but you can't take an absurd argument compare it to another and then suggest because one is they both are.\n\n Do you understand the point of analogies? Saying cars cause crime is absurd because there is really no plausible causal relationship from cars to crime.\n \n There is no plausible causal relationship from incest to abuse.\n \n From the nature of the subject matter incest can only be a co-modifier to abuse it is a single act that exists in two categories.\n \n Incest does not have to be abuse and cars do not have to be get away cars.",

   "1 good study would be enough. The problem is none(or very few) of the objective studies are concluding incest is inherently damaging, they are concluding abuse when combined with betrayal and socially pressured guilt all at a young age is significantly more damaging than abuse otherwise.\n \n That doesn't even contradict my position, anyone could have predicted such results easily.\n\n \n Again, since you don't want to acknowledge this. The difference between incest and abuse is the victim. The added difficulty stems from trust because it is a family member and there is no place for the child to go and no one to turn to during and after, so all those things you mention can occur in plain abuse but are multiplied both in intensity and instance with incest. One of your articles explains this.\n \n No it wouldn't contradict your position because that isn't correct. You left out how these effects are associated with incest instead citing only they are seen in cases of straight abuse.\n \n \nI do not deny this but I do doubt it if that makes any sense. Could you please find these criteria? How could they anything but the product of a medical definition of normal and how could the medical definition of normal (if any) be based on anything but the social consensus?\n\n \n Normal can be defined as lacking anything abnormal. Social consensous is not exactly accurate as it implies some kind of national agreement in which the population makes a conscience choice as to how the medical profession defines and decides who needs treatment and who doesn't. Medical professionals do however use typical behavior found in society as a gauge in defining normal.\n \n \n normal - definition of normal in the Medical dictionary - by the Free Online Medical Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia.\n \n Normal definition of Normal in the Free Online Encyclopedia.\n \n Psychometrics - encyclopedia article about Psychometrics.\n \n \n \nThat's nice.... So what made them think that? Bad data? Bad definitions?\n\n \n Pretty much. The point thouigh that this was not something that was in effect for @ 20 years.\n \n \nAgain you appeal to the authority of the psychological profession. Do you want to link to more articles? You pretty much ignored my analysis last time; it didn't seem like you were really interested in what your professionals were saying.\n\n \n An appeal to authority is not necessarily false. \n \n I used one of your articles in a rebuttle. You mocked it. I coulde cite the article from RAAIN which you used to show the frequency of incest is unknown. Your implication though used the information contrary to how it was intended. They didn't mean that they didn't know how often making hardly at all a possiblility. \n \n Your article concerning the German couple who have had 3 handicapped children wasn't much help either. Expecially considering the circumstances that brought them together and her condition.\n \n The \"well adjusted girl\" you tried to give as an example left far to many necessary questions unanswered to be a consideration.\n \n Not trying to compete but the article I posted I believe come from sources having more authority on the subject concerning the history of psychology and homosexuals, not saying that they were completly wrong but where the two were not consistant I would lean towards mine (I know imagine that, but is there really a way to say that without it seeming suspect?)\n \n \nApparently I am not smart enough to see it. She was consenting, that she behaved with inappropriate polygamy seems to me irrelavant. We cannot proceed on the standard that we are allowed to outlaw things that tend to ruin families (not to say incest is one of those things). We would outlaw divorce tomorrow.\n\n \n Until the questions I asked could be answered she just doesn't make a good representitive case. No she wasn't forced, but niether are abused wives forced to stay. Physical force is not the only means of control or coercion. It is hard to determine if incest played a role because we don't know when it began, how it began, the role the father played etc. \n \n \nThe constant thread in the catholic position on sex and family is the preservation of the family unit at all costs. I know you are a subjectivist but will you at least admit that you are advocating some compromise between their extreme and total liberty?\n\n \n I have not denied it, but two things to consider despite the evidence present in the Bible The Church is opposed to incest and your perspective on the denial of freedom is one perspective. \n \n You see government as denying a person the choice of willing partner based on a potential for harm involving different participants. The problem with this view is it assumes a relative as the only source of potential partners. This differs from gays as they were completly banned from the gender that was their pool. \n \n The best your evidence can conclude is that it is inconclusive. Whether based on lack of research or questionable methods your denial of the validity of research that doesn't support your position does not mean your aguement has been proven.\n \n You argue for a very small % of incest cases, maybe more than is thought but will still be a small %. This then is the dilemma how do you not restrict freedom and protect the innocent. Punishment after the fact is necessary but prevention would be best, but we know the honor system has the least success rate. What has been done is to put the freedom and protection of children before the potential rights of adults. \n \n Either way we are addressing only what might happen. Adults might with each other and they might with children. If you have a win win I am open to it, but I don't see one and the trade off is incredibly fair. Average family has 2.5 kids that means you have out of 6 billion people maybe a half dozen that are off limits. That is a lot of variety to choose from and if someone still can't find anyone better than his sister that he deserves to be single.\n \n \nYou want to allow certain things that tend to harm families, ruin relationships, hurt people but if at some point you think the scales tip then it's alright to outlaw it as too harmful.\n\n \n And you don't? Your philosophy has it's set of conditions to be adhered to as well. People are far from perfect these trade offs are an unfortunate result of our behavior towards one another. \n \n \nYour missing the common thread in my camp though. You don't have a right to outlaw divorce because you can't force people to stay together just like you can't force them to stay apart.\n\n \n The factors involved are different and barely comparable in certain aspects.\n \n \nIf people destroy themselves it is terrible but it is their fault. Take drugs for instance, they are illegal but alcohol isn't. The only reason why alcohol remains while drugs like marijuana don't is social inertia. Those who enacted prohibition used the exact same arguments about 'protecting people from themselves' as you seem to be using now.\n\n \n Not themselves those around them and those around them who are unable to protect themselves. If Joe wants to leap off a building that is bad but if he makes arraingements to have himself cleaned off the street he has a good arguement to take the plunge, but not when he wants to take his sister with him.\n \n \nIt's hearsay on a speculation. I don't think we should get too fussy about this point because I am absolutely sure you could find some paper which no reservations damns all incest.\n \n What I find interesting is the way that reservations are being made, that many of my points are supported by links we have contributed. So even your ironclad appeal to authority is seeming not so hard. The experts don't all agree and so far they corroborated my observations about case studies and the nature of the damage causing elements.\n\n \n No not really. Your saying that it is the abuse and resulting effects of abuse that are causing the problems and the evidence isn't strong that is instead incest. The incest is the abuse. This is typically where you narrow your definition of incest to deal with only adults who are thought to be consenting and then make a distinction between abuse and incest thinking abuse is always present and occurs first. \n \n \nNo matter how much decongestant you take you will not stop an infection that would take place. In fact you might make it worse.\n\n \n That is why we take care of ourselves so that we don't get sick in the first place. Prevention is best.\n \n \nYou are saying that by outlawing incest we can stop or minimize the mental disorders that cause some incest. It doesn't follow.\n\n \n I am saying outlawing incest can minimize the mental and social disorders that result from incest which can include victims repeating their experiences.\n \n \nWell as the article you linked to noted from previous research some believe that between two young people (of about the same age) no abuse is necessarily involved.\n\n \n Yes\n \n \nSo what are you saying? Many people are adults.\n\n \n Aren't theyemoticon_smile\n \n But the problem with the adults, the children only when their are other factors involved that are more of an adult nature.\n \n \n\"someone who always thinks about sex and tries to start sexual relationships with people\" is the only definition I could find.\n\n \n Sex maniacs as used was an embellishment and I was not looking to get drawn into argueing it.\n \n \n I thought I could finish before I had to leave but looks like not. I will have to adress the rest later.",

   "Again, since you don't want to acknowledge this. The difference between incest and abuse is the victim.\n\n Without abuse there is no victim.\n \n \nThe added difficulty stems from trust because it is a family member and there is no place for the child to go and no one to turn to during and after, so all those things you mention can occur in plain abuse but are multiplied both in intensity and instance with incest. One of your articles explains this.\n\n Where have I denied it?\n \n \nNo it wouldn't contradict your position because that isn't correct. You left out how these effects are associated with incest instead citing only they are seen in cases of straight abuse.\n\n It seemed like I explicitly addressed that.\n \n \nNormal can be defined as lacking anything abnormal.\n\n Please tell me you didn't think too hard on that one.\n \n \nSocial consensous is not exactly accurate as it implies some kind of national agreement in which the population makes a conscience choice as to how the medical profession defines and decides who needs treatment and who doesn't. \n\n It implies no such thing.\n \nMedical professionals do however use typical behavior found in society as a gauge in defining normal.\n\n Homosexual sex was and comparatively is abnormal then. How many of the population need to do it before it's typical?\n \n \nPretty much. The point thouigh that this was not something that was in effect for @ 20 years.\n\n Which one or both?\n \n \nAn appeal to authority is not necessarily false. \n \n\n It's necessarily inductive which is why I rarely accept it. If I am going through the trouble to argue something, at least the core of something; I typically don't have weak inductive reasoning but deductive reasoning as the source.\n \n There are plenty of things I'm doubtful about but you just never hear them if I don't have a good(deductive) reason to disagree with 'authority'.\n \n \nI used one of your articles in a rebuttle. You mocked it. \n\n Are you talking about the hearsay on speculation? I am talking about the parts of the articles I picked out and repeated. I will be happy to respond to any parts of any article you think are relevant.\n \n \nI coulde cite the article from RAAIN which you used to show the frequency of incest is unknown.\n\n I believe that is what I quoted it for in the first place.\n \n \nYour implication though used the information contrary to how it was intended. They didn't mean that they didn't know how often making hardly at all a possiblility.\n \n And you are saying you don't know but hardly at all is probable about consensual incest that doesn't harm anyone.\n \n \nYour article concerning the German couple who have had 3 handicapped children wasn't much help either. Expecially considering the circumstances that brought them together and her condition.\n\n Sure it was, it illustrated two of my points.\n 1. Consent is quite possible\n 2. Incest can be caused by trauma that does not necessarily mean it's causing trauma.\n \n \nThe \"well adjusted girl\" you tried to give as an example left far to many necessary questions unanswered to be a consideration.\n\n Did I call her well adjusted? It was never my intention to present to you well adjusted people who are just fine. The intention was to provide examples of consensual incest.\n \n\n Not trying to compete but the article I posted I believe come from sources having more authority on the subject concerning the history of psychology and homosexuals, not saying that they were completly wrong but where the two were not consistent I would lean towards mine\n\n I'm sorry I'm not sure which two articles you are speaking of.\n \n \nUntil the questions I asked could be answered she just doesn't make a good representitive case.\n\n Agreed, a good representative case would be very hard to find because they would be keeping the secret and have no desire to seek help.\n \n \nNo she wasn't forced, but niether are abused wives forced to stay. Physical force is not the only means of control or coercion. It is hard to determine if incest played a role because we don't know when it began, how it began, the role the father played etc. \n\n and are you willing to go to the same lengths to stop abused wives from existing?\n \n \nI have not denied it, but two things to consider despite the evidence present in the Bible The Church is opposed to incest and your perspective on the denial of freedom is one perspective. \n \n\n I have already tried to reconcile the issue of morality with you, I failed. I don't believe round II with incest as the pivotal example will work. Therefore I suggest we leave that on the side. All my arguments here about deviations are assuming consent is the standard by which to judge sexual behavior. I do not consider my beliefs on morality to be one perspective amongst many all equally valid, as you know I reject subjectivism totally, but so long as you don't there is no hope of establishing that consent really is the true moral axiom. I believe that consent is the standard by which to judge sexual behavior because consent is the standard by which to judge all behavior. Therefore we should just drop it now if you are challenging the premise of consent in this particular context of sexual behavior.\n \n \nYou see government as denying a person the choice of willing partner based on a potential for harm involving different participants.\n\n Actually I think the government is and has been such a mess that they couldn't possibly give such a coherent reason for such laws. I believe that is why you think it should be illegal. The reason it is illegal probably has much more to do with the religious right and a lack of opposition from the left.\n \n \nThe problem with this view is it assumes a relative as the only source of potential partners.\n\n No it doesn't. Just because there are two possible willing partners doesn't mean it is impossible to deny a person one.\n \n That's like saying if homosexual sex was still illegal bi-sexuals aren't being denied partners. They are just not all.\n \n \nThis differs from gays as they were completly banned from the gender that was their pool. \n\n Agreed, and like I said I don't think the gay movement would have been a quarter as strong as it was if that were not the case. Why make trouble when you can pass for normal?\n \n \nThe best your evidence can conclude is that it is inconclusive. Whether based on lack of research or questionable methods your denial of the validity of research that doesn't support your position does not mean your aguement has been proven.\n\n You realize that if you say something is inherently harmful the burden of proof is on you right? That state is not the default, always the negative is the default.\n \n \nYou argue for a very small % of incest cases, maybe more than is thought but will still be a small %.\n\n Of the total population and even compared to something like bestiality, but off all incest it may not be small. That doesn't really matter though does it.\n \n \nThis then is the dilemma how do you not restrict freedom and protect the innocent.\n\n By outlawing what is harming the innocent and nothing else, as always. You don't outlaw white people because everyone in the KKK is white, you outlaw lynching.\n \n \nPunishment after the fact is necessary but prevention would be best, but we know the honor system has the least success rate.\n\n Agreed, what about anti-incest laws is more preventative than anti-pedophilia laws? or anti-sexual abuse laws?\n \n \nWhat has been done is to put the freedom and protection of children before the potential rights of adults. \n\n Bull, rights do not contradict, they do not overlap, none of them need to be sacrificed to protect others. That is the excuse given by collectivist, in pursuit of the greater good they would sacrifice whatever freedom they feel is getting in the way at the time.\n \n You are not putting the protection of freedom of children before the actual rights of adults by removing the actual rights of adults because the actual rights of adults do not include abusing children.\n \n \nEither way we are addressing only what might happen.\n\n As far as the ratios and the laws, my argument on the consensual potential of incest being identical with that of hetero, homo, bestial, and polygamous is not a 'might happen'.\n \n \nAdults might with each other and they might with children. \n\n If they were with children that would be pedophilia and abuse wouldn't it?\n \n \nIf you have a win win I am open to it, but I don't see one and the trade off is incredibly fair.\n\n Alright, forget incest and prosecute all abuse cases giving higher brackets for punishment to cases involving incest, and especially to cases involving children.\n \n The exact same thing is done for rape, which is considered especially heinous and differentiated from a non-sexual physical assault even though no one is insane enough to think heterosexual sex is inherently damaging.\n \n \nAverage family has 2.5 kids that means you have out of 6 billion people maybe a half dozen that are off limits. That is a lot of variety to choose from and if someone still can't find anyone better than his sister that he deserves to be single.\n\n Who are you to decide who deserves what? Without the anti-incest instinct common sense would seem to indicate that there really wouldn't be many people more ideal than a sister. Common family, common history. They would have 20 years leg up on getting to know each other. This type of reasoning was published and peer reviewed for mother-son incest (although shown to be wrong for some cases by the paper) in the article you posted on the subject.\n \n \nAnd you don't? Your philosophy has it's set of conditions to be adhered to as well.\n\n True, but I would have hoped by now you noticed that the critical factor in my morality is objectivity (or at least I think so). It is this subjective half baked condemnation that I find incompatible with morality. Morality as I have tried to show you must be formulated as principles or you contradict the only premises which could establish it as anything more than a complex pecking order, a particularly interesting social construct of one variety of great apes.\n \n (I don't expect a response this is just commentary) \n \n It is not harm that I establish as the 'no no' it's the violation of rights. People come to harm all the time sometimes through bad luck sometimes through their own faults, and sometimes because of others. Out of all these though I consider only a small subset of being harmed by others as objectively immoral, and that is through the violation of consent. You can't stop people from hurting each other you can only stop them from using force or it's social equivalents on others.\n \n If a heterosexual couple break up there is likely to be some emotional harm, perhaps even permanent. That doesn't mean you just got the green light to start legislating to 'fix' the problem. That is what the catholic church tried to do and they protected the family unit but at the cost of the liberty of many and in the end probably caused more harm than good but that fact doesn't matter to morality, it is a consequence of the objective morality being correct not the other way around.\n \n Nature hurts people and you can't stop that, the greatest harm that could exist (as far as we know) is death and everyone has suffered this evil that we can remember.\n \n \nPeople are far from perfect these trade offs are an unfortunate result of our behavior towards one another.\n \n Again I don't believe in 'trade offs', not in morality.\n \n \n \nThe factors involved are different and barely comparable in certain aspects.\n\n I was only comparing the consent of those involved, as usual (sigh).\n \n \nNot themselves those around them and those around them who are unable to protect themselves. If Joe wants to leap off a building that is bad but if he makes arraingements to have himself cleaned off the street he has a good arguement to take the plunge, but not when he wants to take his sister with him.\n\n and if an incestuous couple decide to have sex even though so called experts insist their minds won't survive the encounter who else are they 'taking down with them'.\n \n \nNo not really.\n\n Yes really\n \n \nYour saying that it is the abuse and resulting effects of abuse that are causing the problems and the evidence isn't strong that is instead incest. \n\n The evidence that it is incest is actually non-existent.\n \n \nThe incest is the abuse. \n\n In rape sex is the abuse.\n \n \nThis is typically where you narrow your definition of incest to deal with only adults who are thought to be consenting and then make a distinction between abuse and incest\n\n I didn't know you had an automatic setting! Convenient :) A small point, the definition of incest includes these abusive cases, it is not narrowed down to only consenting adults.\n \n \nthinking abuse is always present and occurs first. \n\n Uh incest can be abuse when it's forced or when it's with a protector and child. Basically it can be abusive for all the reasons cited in your article on sibling incest. Non-sexual abuse does not have to occur first. The sexual abuse is the abuse.\n \n None of that means that incest is necessarily abuse. It does not mean incest is abuse.\n \n Universal vs particular propositions if you must look it up.\n \n \nThat is why we take care of ourselves so that we don't get sick in the first place. Prevention is best.\n\n That would mean vitamins and minimizing infection vectors. Which translates from the analogy as preventing abuse and/or pedophilia.\n \n \nI am saying outlawing incest can minimize the mental and social disorders that result from incest which can include victims repeating their experiences.\n\n Yet it seems that the mental and social disorders that supposedly result from incest are a result of social condemnation. As was the case for many gays and sadly kids are still killing themselves because they are homosexual. Except now we have outrage that they were condemned by their friends and family, not outrage that they aren't being treated for homosexuality.\n \n It is comments like the one you just made which makes me think you didn't read my analysis on the links you provided.\n \n If there are truly victims than laws against sexual abuse apply.\n \n \nYes\n\n Yes you agree that is the case? That there can exist non-abusive incestuous relationship?\n \n \nBut the problem with the adults, the children only when their are other factors involved that are more of an adult nature.\n\n ummm? You talking about sex in front of children?\n \n \nI thought I could finish before I had to leave but looks like not. I will have to adress the rest later.\n\n Don't let this response dissuade you, I am still looking forward to the rest of your response.",
