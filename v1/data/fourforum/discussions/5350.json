   "The numbers tell the tale. Europe is changing and probably not for the better. The denial of Europeans to this change not surprising based on their past history but it is most alarming.\n ========================\n \n Monday, May 23, 2005\n \n Europe Closing Shop?\n \n Demographics: The population of Europe is set to start shrinking soon. And if recent events there are any indication, that's not a good thing. We may be watching the slow-motion death of a civilization.\n \n The events to which we refer have garnered little notice. Yet each, in its own way, is equally telling about the radical changes in store for Europe - and America as well.\n \n On Friday, it was announced in Germany's Hesse state that all schools will soon offer instruction in Islam to Muslim students. Meanwhile, the U.S.-based Weekly Standard reports that a recent confidential government study found a surprising rise in religious expression among Muslims in French public schools.\n \n What's wrong with all this? Maybe nothing. As in the U.S., many nations in Europe have more than one culture and many religions living within their borders. We are all open societies. The problem is what this says about Europe's future.\n \n Europe is changing. The birthrate, now at 1.5 live births per female, is well below the 2.1 required just to replace its population. Birthrates of immigrant Muslim populations there are three times the average. Upshot: By 2020 or so, the European population will fall by more than 4% while the Muslim population will double.\n \n By 2050, just to keep the current worker-to-retiree ratio intact, Europe will have to bring in an estimated 13.5 million immigrants each year. That's 608 million immigrants - the equivalent of 10 Germanys - over 45 years. Anything less will consign the Continent to unavoidable economic decline.\n \n And where will all these newcomers come from? The same places they've come from in the past - Turkey, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Pakistan - all Muslim. Europe's new nursery.\n \n This has ramifications for America as well. We assume that the Europe we'll be dealing with tomorrow will be much the same as Europe today - one that understands and shares our cultural values. The fact is, as Europe slowly becomes more Muslim and less European, it is at risk of dying - not as a place, but as a culture.\n \n Europe's faithless Christianity is already moribund. In London, more people worship in mosques each week than in the Church of England's houses of worship. And in France, there are more practicing Muslims than baptized Catholics.\n \n This means the U.S. will increasingly be isolated in world affairs. For example, will a Europe of, say, 50 million Muslims be more hostile to the U.S.' pro-Israel policy? Seems likely.\n \n Europe's politics may also become more unstable. Al-Qaida cells have already been found in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Politicians in the Netherlands have been assassinated for \"insulting\" Islam.\n \n Demographic trends also put the U.S. economy at risk. Two years ago, at a much-hyped conference in Spain titled \"Islam in Europe,\" 2,000 European Muslim leaders called on Muslims around the world to help bring about an end to the capitalist system.\n \n As the biggest player in that system, the U.S. faces a delicate task: how to keep an old but estranged friend from committing suicide.\n \n http://www.investors.com/editorial/issues03.asp?v=5/21",

Is this the British equivalent of \"new math?\" How can you be so certain of your position?\n \n A lot of Americans fear the immigration (legal or illegal) from Mexico. We have about 35% here where I live with. The fundamental difference is that they are not Muslim. They are Christian. After they have been here for a while they usually assimilate into our culture and there are no problems of note. However, in Los Angeles, CA. the story is evidently different with a move to annex California to Mexico. Since I don't much give a damn about California for a number of reasons I wouldn't much mind if they succeeded. (It would also mean that a Democrat could never again be elected president.) But again the difference is that virtually all Mexicans (or Hispanic/Latino if you will) are Christian (Catholic) and do not pose a cultural earthquake to our values.\n \n And our black population is virtually all Christian. And they fought to get INTO American society as full-fledged citizens with all the rights thereof. What you have is the mirror opposite.

   "@MM\n \n Your whole theory about inevitable muslim domination relies on the notion that muslims tend to have dramaticly higher birthrates than non-muslims. How are these birthrates calculated?\n\n \n Good question. Those are the reports I have read many times. I just did a \"google\" this popped up. I think it is a fair reindition of the facts so far as I can tell.\n \n \n \n European Islam or Islamic Europe?\n Douglas E. Streusand\n \n If the grim visage of Osama bin Laden personifies the most threatening aspect of Islam for Americans, the European equivalent might easily be a Muslim woman and her children. Europe has low birth rates and aging populations. Combined with increasing numbers of Muslim immigrants and their higher fertility rates the continent may face a demographic and cultural transformation over the next two generations. Though Europe is hardly immune to Islamic totalitarian violence, the distant prospect of cultural submergence overshadows the immediate danger of terrorism. European regimes, even those critical of U.S. policy in Iraq, are cooperating in various ways in the global struggle against Islamic totalitarianism. But that struggle is peripheral to the efforts of EU governments, individually and collectively, to come to grips with the growing Muslim proportion of their populations.\n \n The birth rate of the indigenous peoples of the European Union countries is now well below the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman. Without immigration, the EU's population could drop by 100 million by 2075. In addition to declining in number, the EU population is aging, which means that fewer and fewer workers must support European retirement and welfare systems. As a result, EU governments have an enormous financial incentive to build up their work forces by taking in ever more immigrants.\n \n At present, the population of the EU is approximately 5% Muslim; France is 10% Muslim. Leaving aside the possible admission of the countries with large Muslims populations like Turkey and Bulgaria, the Muslim proportion of the EU population will probably grow to 10% overall by 2020 if current trends continue. If, however, the rate of immigration increases, the proportion of Muslims will rise significantly faster. Some observers believe that a surge in Muslim population may produce a Christian and Jewish flight from Europe. The controversy in France and elsewhere about the wearing of hijab in public schools is only the current idiom of discourse on the future of Europe.\n \n One may reduce various scenarios for Europe's future to two extremes: the evolution of an Islamic Europe, in which Muslim institutions and culture supplant secular and Christian institutions and culture; and the development of a European Islam, in which European Muslims share the European identity developed by European Catholics, Protestants and Jews. More than two centuries ago, Edward Gibbon wrote that but for Charles Martel's victory at Tours in 732, \"Perhaps the interpretation of the Koran would now be taught in the schools of Oxford and her pulpits might demonstrate to a circumcised people the sanctity and truth of the revelation of Mohammed.\" The vision of an Islamic Europe implies the undoing of the alleged effects of that Carolingian triumph. A European Islam, in contrast, would add Islam to Oxford's curriculum without removing anything else.\n \n The idea of a European Islam is not merely the product of wishful thinking of Western liberals... \n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.neweuropereview.com/English/english-streusand.cfm",

I have a doctor who I believe may be a Muslim although I have not questioned him about his religious views. He is from Lebanon and is living the American dream. I had a fraternity brother in college many years ago who was from Palestine. Again, I didn't ask him about his religion. I did meet a living breathing Muslim in Dallas a couple of years ago. He was selling Toyotas and I asked him specifically and whether he had any difficulty with practicing his faith. He said he had no problem and said \"America is the greatest country in the world.\" Now he might have been lying to me to gain my confidence but he seemed sincere. I have exchanged views with a Muslim over in Indonesia. He seemed like a decent enough fellow.\n \n I'm not against Muslims per se. What I do fear is that far too many Muslims are seduced by the likes of bin Laden and that Islam is the centerpiece of their lives. Throw in the issue of Israel and we have a volatile mix. One could argue that this is why Europe is more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than is America. The politicians cannot ignore their constitutuents.",

   "Missouri Mule, you appeared to miss my request for you to provide sources for your claims that Muslims have more children than other British couples, so here is a gentle reminder. Thanks.\n\n \n Well, here is one and there are many. I just did a google search: \"muslim birthrate in Europe.\" \n \n The UN predicts that Europe's non-Muslim population will drop by an estimated 7.5 million over the next 45 years while it's Muslim population will increase. European Christians are having fewer children - an average of 1.5 children each. However, to sustain a population, a birthrate of 2.1 children per woman is required. Since workers are needed to pay taxes and maintain the economy, Europe is bringing in millions of immigrants - mostly Muslim. Approximately 1.6 million new immigrants are needed annually to keep Europe's working population stable. But if Europe wants to maintain the current ratio of workers to retirees, with more of its aging population retiring all the time, it will have to bring in a staggering 13.5 million immigrants every year. Millions of these are (and will probably continue to be) Muslims, especially if Turkey with its seventy-one million (primarily Muslim) population is accepted into the European Union.\n \n Muslims tend to have their children when young, in contrast to the native Europeans. They also tend to have more of them. Estimates suggest that birthrates and immigration will put the Muslim population of Europe at 10 percent (10%) by 2020. (7) Already, the Muslim birthrate in Europe is three times higher than the non-Muslim birthrate. In fact, for the past four years, the most common name for baby boys in Brussels, Belgium has been \"Mohammed,\" with \"Osama\" placing a close second.\n \n In the Netherlands, Muslims represent a majority among children under fourteen in the country's four largest cities. Rotterdam, a port city where over half the population is of foreign origin will soon unveil Europe's largest mosque, and official projections confirm that Amsterdam and Rotterdam will have fifty percent (50%) non-Western populations (mostly Muslim) by 2020. This has brought the Dutch to the realization that their nation, the nation that spawned geniuses like Erasmus, Spinoza and Rembrandt, is in danger of being overwhelmed by an alien culture that knows no compromise and refuses to be assimilated into secular Dutch society.\n \n For these and other reasons, several leading radical Islamic theologians like Yousef al-Qaradawi in Qatar (the spiritual leader of the radical Muslim Brotherhood) and Sheikh Abd al-Rahman al-Sudais in Saudi Arabia speak of the Islamic conquest of Europe simply by allowing demographics and Muslim conversions to take their course. (8) They see the adoption of the Muslim faith and the submission of Christian Europe to Islamic rule as inevitable. \"We will remodel this country in an Islamic image,\" the London-based preacher Sheikh Omar Bakri Muhammad told an attentive audience less than two months after 9/11. \"We will replace the Bible with the Qur'an.\"...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.jfednepa.org/mark%20silverberg/eurabia.html\n \n Here's another interesting article.\n \n Behind the wooden door of a brick Brussels town house, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bastin, 61, a Belgian convert to Islam, holds court before a steady stream of Islamic activists. His fledgling Young Muslims Party is one of the new groups aggressively pursuing pro-Muslim agendas in Europe.\n \n He calls Osama bin Laden \"a modern Robin Hood,\" and the World Trade Center attacks \"a poetic act,\" \"a pure abstraction.\" His 23-year-old son is in jail in Turkey on charges that he was involved in the bombings there that killed 61 people in November 2003.\n \n But Mr. Bastin argues that his son's troubles are evidence that Muslim youths feel politically excluded in Europe. He says political engagement is an antidote to militancy.\n \n \"There is deviance because people don't find their place here,\" he said, a long, hennaed beard falling over the front of his Arab-style tunic, his graying hair tucked beneath a turban fashioned from a multicolored head scarf. \"If we deny that political voice that can judge and determine what is good for Muslims, from the point of view of their religion and their citizenship, their children are going to look for adventures elsewhere.\"\n \n Mr. Bastin, who converted to Islam in 1972 after a spiritual quest led him to Morocco, dismisses the far right's fears of an Islamization of Europe, even if he does dream of an Islamic theocracy governing the Continent someday.\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://64.207.171.242/pages/news_belgium_021205.html",
