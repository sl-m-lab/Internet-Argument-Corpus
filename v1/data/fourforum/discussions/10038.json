   "A fascinating article: http://nymag.com/news/features/33520/\n \nBecause many of these newly identified \"gay\" traits and characteristics are known to be influenced in utero, researchers think they may be narrowing in on when gayness is set-and identifying its possible triggers. They believe that homosexuality may be the result of some interaction between a pregnant mother and her fetus. Several hypothetical mechanisms have been identified, most pointing to an alteration in the flow of male hormones in the formation of boys and female hormones in the gestation of girls. What causes this? Nobody has any direct evidence one way or another, but a list of suspects includes germs, genes, maternal stress, and even allergy-maybe the mother mounts some immunological response to the fetal hormones. \n",

   "Well, there's not much new here... a hair whorl study or two apart. It's been fairly clear for some time that social explanations for sexual orientation don't work and that its roots lie in biology, genetical and epigenetical.\n \n Still, gaydar is a different issue. Culture is certainly going to affect how sexual orientation is expressed, and how easily it can be detected. But I can't see it having a huge effect on innate feelings. It's true, for example, that babies grow up to become adults who tend to find people of their own cultural background more sexually attractive, but there doesn't seem to be any such trigger for sexual orientation. Straight parents do not always raise straight children, nor do gay parents always produce gay offspring. It's a complex business. Still, culture probably does inform people how a sexual orientation is supposed to act.",
