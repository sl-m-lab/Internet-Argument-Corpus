   "Administration supports lesbian employee's case\n By SUDHIN THANAWALA, Associated Press - 4 days ago\n SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - In a strongly worded legal brief, the Obama administration has said the federal act that defines marriage as being between a man and a woman was motivated by hostility toward gays and lesbians and is unconstitutional.\n The brief was filed Friday in federal court in San Francisco in support of a lesbian federal employee's lawsuit claiming the government wrongly denied health insurance coverage to her same-sex spouse.\n The Justice Department says Karen Golinski's suit should not be dismissed because the law under which her spouse was denied benefits - the Defense of Marriage Act - violates the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of equal protection.\n \"The official legislative record makes plain that DOMA Section 3 was motivated in large part by animus toward gay and lesbian individuals and their intimate relationships, and Congress identified no other interest that is materially advanced by Section 3,\" the brief reads, referring to the section in the act that defines marriage as being between a man and a woman.\n Though the administration has previously said it will not defend the marriage act, the brief is the first court filing in which it urges the court to find the law unconstitutional, said Tobias Barrington Wolff, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n \"This brief represents the concrete manifestation of a complete paradigm shift in the federal government's position on anti-gay discrimination and the constitutional rights of married same-sex couples,\" Wolff said in a phone interview Saturday.\n The brief argues that gays and lesbians have been subject to a history of discrimination by federal, state and local governments and private parties. It also lays out the administration's position that sexual orientation is an \"immutable characteristic,\" that gays and lesbians are minorities with limited political power and that sexual orientation has no bearing on someone's ability to contribute to society and advances no legitimate policy interest.\n \"It's quite powerful to have the administration saying in a court filing that this kind of discrimination should be viewed suspiciously,\" said Tara Borelli, an attorney for Golinski.\n Attorneys for a U.S. House of Representatives group that has stepped in to defend the marriage act's constitutionality in the Golinski case did not immediately respond to requests for comment. House Republicans previously had criticized Obama administration's decision that the marriage act was unconstitutional and would not be defended by the Department of Justice in court.\n In court filings, they have said that multiple courts have relied on Congress's justifications for enacting the law to uphold its constitutionality.\n Golinski is a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals lawyer. She sued the U.S. Office of Personnel Management last year for not authorizing family health insurance coverage for her same-sex spouse.\n Her attorneys are now seeking summary judgment in her favor.\n Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Associated Press.

   "Biblical inerrancy is not a view shared by most Christians.\n\n \n I don't care if 99.9% of all self proclaimed christians on earth rejected biblical inerrancy, that would have no impact at all regarding the actual and factual inerrancy of Gods word once they all stood before the judgement seat of Christ.\n \n \nYou don't get to decide who is and is not a Christian. The ancient creeds lay out the beliefs shared by Christians, and inerrancy of the scriptures is not one of them.\n\n \n I never said I was the decider of who is and who isn't a Christian. It isn't my job to make that determination, but I am both qualified to and responsible for speaking the TRUTH as outlined in Gods Word. And everything I've said to Matthew S is the gospel truth and will be proven true when he stands before God at the judgement. He will learn that you were the devils disciple who lied to him every time you encouraged and supported his sinful sexual proclivities. You are no better or spiritually insightful than assipiter who admits he is an atheist and you too will learn the hard truth when you finally meet the Lord for the first time in your life at the judgement. \n \n As for the bibles inerrancy, I challenge you to show where it denies it is inerrant. And if you accept the bible as Gods word for Man, how then can you pick and choose what you decide is right and reject what conflicts with your personal preferences?\n \n \nJesus knew people like you, they were the Pharisees. You make an idol out of scripture, preferring it to the living Word of Jesus Christ. Hatred, idolatry and fits of rage, not to mention factionalism, are fruits of the flesh, not fruit of the spirit, just as much as sexual immorality. You also don't get to define sexual immorality.\n\n \n The bible is Gods living word and it is interpreted for us by the power of the Holy Spirit. If we reject that interpretation and insert our own fleshly interpretations which oppose its very clear message, such as the unnaturalness of homosexuality as a sexual proclivity, then that person makes himself an enemy of God and of His truths which are eternal and uncompromising.\n \n Psa 19:7 The law of the LORD is [fn]perfect, restoring the soul; The testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.\n Psa 19:8 The precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; The commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.\n Psa 19:9 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; The judgments of the LORD are true; they are righteous altogether.\n \n AND\n \n Rom 12:1 Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, [fn]acceptable to God, which is your [fn]spiritual service of worship.\n Rom 12:2 And do not be conformed to this [fn]world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may [fn]prove what the will of God is, that which is good and [fn]acceptable and perfect.\n \n This passage from Romans makes clear what attitude a true believer ought to have in submitting ourselves to Gods authority so that we reflect what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect. So it isn't me defining what is sin or sexual immorality, all I'm doing is defending what the bible actually says on the subject. What is so sad is that if you were a like minded christian and a true believer you wouldn't see me as an enemy but as a brother in Christ.\n \n \nFornication,adultery and homosexuality are sins according to the Bible so denying that homosexuals are not sinners( according to the Bible) is dishonest .\n Any 'Christian' church that does not regard adultery,fornication and homosexuality as sins are heretical and psuedo Christian sects.\n The truth of it is that very very few people will get to heaven( if it exists) and that includes 'Christians' that twist the Bible to suit their own agendas.\n Either accept the teachings as they are written or accept you are not a Christian.\n\n \n Well said, Gansao, here is a passage that warns us of people like Jo Bennett who is in fact a ravenous wolf dressed in sheep's clothing as he perpetrates lies that oppose Gods truths.\n \n Mat 7:13 \"Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it.\n Mat 7:14 \"For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who find it.\n Mat 7:15 \"Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.",

Did God create people to grow up to be murderers and rapists or is it more likely that these types of evil exist due to the sinful nature that Jesus came to heal.

What a nasty trick, just so he could punish his own creations for successive generations to come! \n \n \nYou see, God doesn't do evil so He didn't create people to represent a sexual proclivity that He condemns in His word as wrong and unnatural.\n\n \n How did people create something that even occurs in other animals? \n \n \nDo you believe that God created Hitler to be a mass murderer of the Jewish people? Did God create people to grow up to be murderers and rapists or is it more likely that these types of evil exist due to the sinful nature that Jesus came to heal.\n\n \n God is said to have created everything. He must be blamed for the bad things that happen, if he's to be praised for the good. It can't just be left up to us to decide and we're blamed for the bad, then if something good happens, through our own efforts, it's said to be the work of God. \n \n How did God coming to Earth(as Jesus), supposedly committing suicide, martyring himself, solve any of our problems? It didn't.\n \n \n Here's how the bible puts it:\n \n Jam 1:13 Let no one say when he is tempted, \"I am being tempted [fn]by God\"; for God cannot be tempted [fn]by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone.\n Jam 1:14 But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.\n Jam 1:15 Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin [fn]is accomplished, it brings forth death.\n Jam 1:16 Do not be [fn]deceived, my beloved brethren.\n Jam 1:17 Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or [fn]shifting shadow.\n Jam 1:18 In the exercise of His will He brought us forth by the word of truth, so that we would be [fn]a kind of first fruits [fn]among His creatures.\n \n God does not do evil, nor does He create it for the destruction of humanity. The god of this world, Satan is the purveyor of human destruction on both an individual and a mass scale whenever it occurs. Due to our free will, God allows evil to occur on earth but only because it is the result of our disobedience and willful acts of rebellion against His righteous values and His holiness.\n\n \n We rebel against what our reason tells us is wrong, despite what the Bible says. When we don't use our reason, then we're in trouble. \n \n \nI know you will reject this but that doesn't negate or nullify it as the gospel truth and a valid spiritual explanation for how and why evil runs rampant in this world. Simply put, Homosexuality is the result of a fallen and sinful nature, not the purposeful creation by God in any way. God wouldn't ever create that which is unnatural according to everything His holy word says.\n\n \n We'll decide with our reason, as it's been all along. It's been shown to be dangerous to ignore our reason and blindly follow authority, including in the way gay people are treated in this society.",
