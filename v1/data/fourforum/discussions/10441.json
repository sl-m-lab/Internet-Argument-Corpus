   "Revised ENDA Also Reduces Protections For Gays Legal Group Says\n by 365Gay.com Newscenter Staff\n \n The newest version of the bill is not simply the old version with the transgender protections stripped out - but rather a totally reworked version in several additional and troubling ways Lambda said. \n \"Leaving out protections for transgender people is unacceptable, and passing a bill riddled with loopholes will make it harder to achieve equality on the job,\" said Kevin Cathcart, Executive Director at Lambda Legal. \n \"You can't be fired for being a lesbian or a gay man, but you can be fired if your boss thinks you fit their stereotype of one.\" \n In addition to the missing protections for transgender people on the job, the new bill also leaves out a key element to protect any employee, including lesbians and gay men who may not conform to their employer's idea of how a man or woman should look and act. \n This is a huge loophole through which employers sued for sexual orientation discrimination can claim that their conduct was actually based on gender expression, a type of discrimination that the new bill does not prohibit, said Lambda. \n The new version of ENDA also states without qualification that refusal by employers to extend health insurance benefits to the domestic partners of their employees that are provided only to married couples cannot be considered sexual orientation discrimination. \n The old version at least provided that states and local governments could require that employees be provided domestic partner health insurance when such benefits are provided to spouses. \n In the previous version of ENDA the religious exemptions had some limitations. The new version has a blanket exemption under which, for example, hospitals or universities run by faith-based groups can fire or refuse to hire people they think might be gay or lesbian. \n \"After working together for so many years on a bill to provide protections for the LGBT community on the job - we can do better than this,\" Cathcart said in a statement on Monday.",

   "Last week, leaders in the House of Representatives abandoned a fully inclusive Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) by creating a far weaker bill with no protections for transgender people. They split the existing bill into pieces: one for sexual orientation discrimination only, the other for gender identity, with no real plans to enact the gender identity bill. This is unacceptable.\n \n The LGBT civil rights movement is once again at a crossroads and we must choose the right path. Lambda Legal is joining with leaders across the country calling on Congress to pass a fully inclusive employment nondiscrimination law that has real protections for lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender people. \n \n Call your member of Congress TODAY and tell him/her to fight for ENDA as it was - a fully inclusive law - and to reject any nondiscrimination bill that does not protect transgender people.

   "This in from Pam Spaulding's House Blend blog:\n \n HRC signs letter to Capitol Hill supporting original ENDA\n \n Most pro-gay rights groups have decided not to support the measure that stripped transgender Americans from nondiscrimination law. Here's the text of their letter to George Miller, chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor, U.S. House of Representatives:\n \n \nDear Chairman Miller:\n \n On behalf of the undersigned organizations, we write to express our opposition to the strategy and process by which the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (HR 3685) is to be considered in the House of Representatives. We ask that the markup in the House Education and Labor Committee, scheduled for less than 24 hours from now, be canceled.\n \n For many years, we have worked to develop an employment non-discrimination bill that protects the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. Our organizations support the Employment Non-Discrimination Act as introduced (H.R. 2015).\n \n Although we believe that the bill's sponsor, Congressman Barney Frank (D-MA), and the House Democratic Leadership have a sincere desire to protect the LGBT community from discrimination, we believe the process and strategy that has been adopted is a mistake. That mistake is compounded by moving forward with a markup tomorrow.\n \n If you have any questions or need further information, please contact Nancy Zirkin, LCCR Vice President, at (202) 263-2880 or Rob Randhava, LCCR Counsel, at (202) 466-6058.\n \n Sincerely,\n American Civil Liberties Union\n American Friends Service Committee\n Gender Public Advocacy Coalition\n Human Rights Campaign\n Leadership Conference on Civil Rights\n Legal Momentum\n National Association of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Centers\n National Center for Lesbian Rights\n National Center for Transgender Equality\n National Council of Jewish Women\n National Gay and Lesbian Task Force\n Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG National)\n People For the American Way\n Pride At Work, AFL-CIO\n Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations\n GLSEN - the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network\n Servicemembers Legal Defense Network\n United Methodist Church, General Board of Church and Society\n The Woodhull Freedom Foundation\n\n \n It's a pretty comprehensive rejection.\n \n I have to admit, I also disagree with Barney Frank on this compromise (his heart is in the right place, but his common sense did a bunk). Michael Signorile has an excellent piece on why Frank and the Democratic congressional leadership were wrong on this:\n \n The ENDA Debacle\n \n \n...it's a difficult position to defend and a huge mistake to remove gender identity from the bill. Those who've argued that it's \"pragmatic\" or part of \"incremental\" gains are making all the wrong comparisons, and I think they know it. They say, for example, that this is equivalent to accepting, where possible, civil unions for now over marriage: Even though we believe marriage is the goal we herald civil union gains as an interim measure. But that doesn't wash: Whether it's marriage or civil unions it's still for all of us and not just some of us. (Or did I miss the part where some genius said, Let's pass civil unions for lesbians first and come back to the gay men later, since lesbians might be less threatening than gay men?) Incrementalism does not mean cutting out whole groups of people.\n\n \n I can't refute his reasoning. One might as well have supported limited marriage between light-skinned black men and white women, because marriage between dark-skinned black men and white women was unacceptable to the Moral Majority.\n \n I also have to wonder what the rush on ENDA is? With a president who is a kowtowing slave to the gibbering Christianist right of the GOP, this bill isn't going anywhere, anyway. It will be vetoed, and the Democrats haven't the votes to override a veto, thanks to GOP bigots. Best to let it rest, and try again when the White House Passage is finally clear.",

   "It certainly is interesting that this undesirable change happened AFTER democrats took control of Congress. But then I've always said that the DNC's support of gay rights was more of a token effort to hold a voting group than anything. So I can't say I'm surprised.\n \n From the blog cited earlier ...\n \nENDA's greatest impact for gays and lesbians would be as a starting point to broader legislation: banning discrimination in housing, public accommodations and elsewhere; changing our education system, teaching gay history in public schools and standing up against intolerance; marriage rights in states across the country. But even more far reaching, the effect of pro-gay and pro-trans civil rights laws, just as the passage of laws banning racial discrimination, is to instill tolerance in the culture and in society over a period of several generations. Even with laws in place it's still often difficult to stop discrimination ( Jena, LA is a case in point), but the laws are more about changing attitudes than anything else, so that people, on their own, voluntarily, do not discriminate as time goes on. Governments and the force of law, over decades, do change the culture and change people's thinking. They help to change how people raise their children, moving entire generations in a direction away from hate.\n\n For starters, I find it interesting that it blatantly admits that the more stringent (on businesses) version of ENDA is \"a starting point\" and make no bones about the idea that they want things like gay history legislated (after all, they mention it in the context of other legislative matters). \n \n But what is most troubling here to me is this idea that our laws are coming to be regarded as being for a purpose more than keeping order and direct protection in our society--that laws would be passed for the purpose of advancing ideology over future generations. Maybe it's just me, but the idea that we would give the passing of laws the task of \"instilling\" an ideology is pretty unsettling to me. I'd argue that no such strategy was behind racial discrimination laws, but rather they were simply put in place for their proper purpose ALONE: to protect racial minorities. There is nothing wrong with that. In fact, I think that's a great motivation for ENDA. Now, granted, a \" change in attitudes\" did come about as a result in such cases of racial non-discrimination laws, but as an effect and not cause. I'm not keen on this 'educating-society-via-law' thing. For instance, the reasons we have laws against shoplifting isn't (IMO) to advance a morality about stealing, but rather simply to protect people from getting their things taken. This concept of attitude-change-via-law changes the whole idea of laws being for the people into people being for the laws. \n \n It is good enough that ENDA protects people from discrimination. That's all the justification we need for it. These groups showing their hand that they aim to use law as an ideological tool tends to concern the somewhat libertarian among us, myself included. That said, we can't police motivations. People can fight for laws for whatever reason they want to, but I think motivations speak volumes sometimes. For me, ENDA is justified as it was BEFORE the recent changes were made, simply on the basis that it protects people from discrimination in the workplace.",

He has written recently about the ninth amendment and how it should properly be understood in light of the intentions of the framers. Here is an abstract of an article by Barnett. The quotations are in italics. I have bolded the section that seems most relevant to our discussion here: \n \n http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=789384 \n \n The Ninth Amendment: It Means What It Says \n \n RANDY E. BARNETT \n Georgetown University Law Center \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Boston Univ. School of Law Working Paper No. 05-14 \n Texas Law Review, Vol. 85, No. 1, 2006 \n \n \n Abstract: \n Although the Ninth Amendment appears on its face to protect unenumerated individual rights of the same sort as those that were enumerated in the Bill of Rights, courts and scholars have long deprived it of any relevance to constitutional adjudication. With the growing interest in originalist methods of interpretation since the 1980s, however, this situation has changed. In the past twenty years, five originalist models of the Ninth Amendment have been propounded by scholars: the state law rights model, the residual rights model, the individual natural rights model, the collective rights model, and the federalism model. This Article examines thirteen crucial pieces of historical evidence that either directly contradict the state law and residual rights models, undercut the collective rights model, or strongly support the individual natural rights and federalism models. Evaluating the five models in light of this evidence establishes that the Ninth Amendment actually meant at the time of its enactment what it appears now to say: the unenumerated (natural) rights that people possessed prior to the formation of government, and which they retain afterwards, should be treated in the same manner as those (natural) rights that were enumerated in the Bill of Rights. In short, the Amendment is what it appears to be: a meaningful check on federal power and a significant guarantee of individual liberty.  ",

   "http://www.365gay.com/Newscon07/10/102307enda.htm\n \n \n \n(Washington) In its first statement on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act which would protect gays and lesbians in the workforce the White House said Tuesday the bill is likely unconstitutional and that if it passes in Congress the president's senior aides would recommend vetoing it. \n \n \"[The bill] is inconsistent with the right to the free exercise of religion as codified by Congress in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA),\" the White House said in a statement. \n \n The House is expected to vote on ENDA, along with an amendment that would extend protections to include gender identity on Wednesday. \n \n The White House raised what it called two examples of how ENDA would violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. \n \n \"For instance, schools that are owned by or directed toward a particular religion are exempted by the bill; but those that emphasize religious principles broadly will find their religious liberties burdened by H.R. 3685. A second concern is H.R. 3685's authorization of Federal civil damage actions against State entities, which may violate States' immunity under the Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\" \n \n The administration also said that ENDA was result in unnecessary litigation. \n \n \"For instance, the bill establishes liability for acting on 'perceived' sexual orientation, or 'association' with individuals of a particular sexual orientation. If passed, H.R. 3685 is virtually certain to encourage burdensome litigation beyond the cases that the bill is intended to reach.\" \n \n In addition the White House said that provisions of ENDA \"give Federal statutory significance to same-sex marriage rights under State law. These provisions conflict with the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as the legal union between one man and one woman. The Administration strongly opposes any attempt to weaken this law, which is vital to defending the sanctity of marriage.\" \n \n Rep. George Miller (D-CA), chair of the House Education and Labor Committee, blasted the White House statement. \n \n \"It is shameful that the President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto landmark legislation to end workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation. Fully qualified, capable Americans should never be denied a job or fired from a job for non-work related reasons,\" Miller said. \n \n \"Basing employment decisions on prejudice and not on merit is un-American and should have no place in our society. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act is an historic civil rights bill and if the President opposes it he will be on the wrong side of history.\"\n \n The threatened veto is the latest in a series of problems ENDA has encountered. \n \n It originally included all members of the LGBT community, but the bill's author, Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass) removed gender identity fearing the legislation might not get out of committee.\n \n The move angered most LGBT rights groups, many of whom accused Frank of selling out transsexuals.\n \n Nevertheless, the revised bill passed the House Education and Labor Committee last week on a 27 - 21 vote.

I say take care of the two concerns of the White House and send him another bill. It's better than nothing.\n\n \n ENDA already contains exceptions for anti-gay discrimination by religious institutions. Here's a summary from the HRC about what ENDA does and doesn't do:\n \n \nWhat ENDA Does\n * Extends federal employment discrimination protections currently provided based on race, religion, sex, national origin, age and disability to sexual orientation and gender identity* Prohibits public and private employers, employment agencies and labor unions from using an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity as the basis for employment decisions, such as hiring, firing, promotion or compensation* Provides for the same procedures, and similar, but somewhat more limited, remedies as are permitted under Title VII and the Americans with Disabilities Act* Applies to Congress and the federal government, as well as employees of state and local governments\n What ENDA Does Not Do\n * Cover businesses with fewer than 15 employees* Apply to most jobs at religious organizations. For any class of jobs, a religious organization can require employees to follow the tenets and teachings of their religion, including ones that bar gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender employees* Apply to the uniformed members of the armed forces (the bill doesn't affect the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy)* Allow for quotas or preferential treatment based on sexual orientation or gender identity* Allow a \"disparate impact\" claim similar to the one available under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Therefore, an employer is not required to justify a neutral practice that may have a statistically disparate impact on individuals because of their sexual orientation or gender identity* Allow the imposition of affirmative action for a violation of ENDA* Allow the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to collect statistics on sexual orientation or gender identity or compel employers\n to collect such statistics.* Apply retroactively\n\n \n Bush is so far in the pockets of the religious right he'd veto ANY legislation remotely instituting ANY equal protections for gay Americans. Since ENDA is doomed in this maladministration anyway, might as well go for the whole loaf. It will make it that much easier to get it passed when the religiously controlled GOP gets dumped on the trash heap of history.",

   "White House Warns Of ENDA Veto\n by 365Gay.com Newscenter Staff\n \n Posted: October 23, 2007 - 4:00 pm ET\n \n (Washington) In its first statement on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act which would protect gays and lesbians in the workforce the White House said Tuesday the bill is likely unconstitutional and that if it passes in Congress the president's senior aides would recommend vetoing it. \n \n \"[The bill] is inconsistent with the right to the free exercise of religion as codified by Congress in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA),\" the White House said in a statement. \n \n The House is expected to vote on ENDA, along with an amendment that would extend protections to include gender identity on Wednesday. \n \n The White House raised what it called two examples of how ENDA would violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. \n \n \"For instance, schools that are owned by or directed toward a particular religion are exempted by the bill; but those that emphasize religious principles broadly will find their religious liberties burdened by H.R. 3685. A second concern is H.R. 3685's authorization of Federal civil damage actions against State entities, which may violate States' immunity under the Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\"\n \n The administration also said that ENDA was result in unnecessary litigation.\n \n \"For instance, the bill establishes liability for acting on 'perceived' sexual orientation, or 'association' with individuals of a particular sexual orientation. If passed, H.R. 3685 is virtually certain to encourage burdensome litigation beyond the cases that the bill is intended to reach.\"\n \n In addition the White House said that provisions of ENDA \"give Federal statutory significance to same-sex marriage rights under State law. These provisions conflict with the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as the legal union between one man and one woman. The Administration strongly opposes any attempt to weaken this law, which is vital to defending the sanctity of marriage.\"\n \n Rep. George Miller (D-CA), chair of the House Education and Labor Committee, blasted the White House statement.\n \n \"It is shameful that the President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto landmark legislation to end workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation. Fully qualified, capable Americans should never be denied a job or fired from a job for non-work related reasons,\" Miller said.\n \n \"Basing employment decisions on prejudice and not on merit is un-American and should have no place in our society. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act is an historic civil rights bill and if the President opposes it he will be on the wrong side of history.\"\n \n The threatened veto is the latest in a series of problems ENDA has encountered.\n \n It originally included all members of the LGBT community, but the bill's author, Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass) removed gender identity fearing the legislation might not get out of committee.\n \n The move angered most LGBT rights groups, many of whom accused Frank of selling out transsexuals.\n \n Nevertheless, the revised bill passed the House Education and Labor Committee last week on a 27 - 21 vote. (story) Several committee Democrats, including presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich refused to support the measure without the inclusion of protections for trans people.\n \n Following the vote Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) proposed an amendment that would reinstate gender identity and secured the support of House leadership to introduce it Wednesday when ENDA reaches the floor. (story)\n \n Frank and Baldwin are the only two out members of Congress.\n \n Friday, Frank announced he would support the amendment and said he would lobby for its passage.

I could see businesses hurting or going under over that, enough that there could be a big backlash.\n\n \n Bush's \"concerns\" are nothing but a rationale for vetoing the bill in order to please the religious right, which has been lobbying hard against ENDA in any form. These \"concerns\" make no sense; the bill already exempts religious organizations, and it's well-crafted to guarantee religious liberty and to protect people from employment discrimination. It would be a terrible idea to take out gender identity from the bill. \n \n There are so few transgender people that it's absurd to claim that protecting them from discrimination would harm employers. Federal law currently protects people from discrimination on the basis of race, religion, national origin, sex, age, and disability status. ENDA would add sexual orientation and, I hope, gender identity. Members of Congress are not going to vote down ENDA because it protects transgender people, a tiny group, from employment discrimination, and if the next president is a Democrat, she or he is not going to veto the bill because of this. \n \n We have no good reason to push forward a watered-down ENDA that Bush will simply find other reasons to veto, because of pressure from the religious right. No ENDA will satisfy them, and Bush is desperate to hang on to the little popular support that he has. I think we should wait and move to enact a strong ENDA after Bush is gone.",

   "Gay Ambassador Resigns Over State Department's Discrimination Against Gay And Lesbian Employees\n \n Remember the media and wingnut fuss when then-Secy. Powell appointed a gay ambassador to Romania, Michael Guest, a few years ago? Well, they didn't bother to remove the anti-gay discriminatory policies, and now he's quit in protest:\n \n \n\"Most departing ambassadors use these events to talk about their successes . . . But I want to talk about my signal failure, the failure that in fact is causing me to leave the career that I love,\" said Mr. Guest, 50, whose most recent assignment was dean of the leadership and management school at the Foreign Service Institute, the government's school for diplomats.\n \n \"For the past three years, I've urged the Secretary and her senior management team to redress policies that discriminate against gay and lesbian employees. Absolutely nothing has resulted from this. And so I've felt compelled to choose between obligations to my partner - who is my family - and service to my country. That anyone should have to make that choice is a stain on the Secretary's leadership and a shame for this institution and our country,\" he said.\n \n Among the inequities cited by Mr. Guest and other gay diplomats: unlike heterosexual spouses, gay partners are not entitled to State Department-provided security training, free medical care at overseas posts, guaranteed evacuation in case of a medical emergency, transportation to overseas posts, or special living allowances when foreign service officers are assigned to places like Iraq, where diplomatic families are not permitted.\n\n \n This is completely unnecessary discrimination, but it will take an act of Congress to stop Republicans from making gays second class citizens.",

Only 27% were opposed.\n http://www.glaad.org/media/guide/infocus/crimes.php\n \n Poll after poll continues to show that the American public supports hate crimes legislation inclusive of sexual orientation, including a Kaiser Family Foundation poll released in November 2001 showing 73 percent of Americans supporting hate crimes legislation that includes sexual orientation.\n http://www.hrc.org/laws_and_elections/5660.htm\n \n 1) There are even polls out there that show a majority of REPUBLICAN voters are now in favor of hate crime legislation for gays.\n Wasn't always the case, but it is now...\n \n 2) I have never seen any poll which demonstrates a majority disapproval for either hate crime legislation, or gays to be covered by hate crime legislation.\n I challenge anybody to find one.

Moreover, 65 percent of Protestant and other non-Catholic Christians said they would favor it.\n \n Under current federal law, hate crimes apply to acts of violence against individuals on the basis of race, religion, color, or national original. H.R. 1592, the legislation currently being reviewed by the Senate, would add gender, sexual orientation and gender identity to the hate crimes law.\n \n Highly religious Americans were less likely to favor expanding the federal hate crime laws than those who seldom attend church. Still, 64 percent of those who attend church weekly expressed that they favor the bill. Among the less religious, 67 percent of those who attend church almost every week or monthly support the expansion and 73 percent of Americans who seldom or never attend church also favor it.\n \n A larger gap was seen between conservatives and liberals with 57 percent of the former group expressing favor and 82 of the latter showing support.\n http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070517/27472_Poll:_Most_Americans,_Protestants_Favor_Hate_Crimes_Expansion.htm",

The actions of Republican legislators, who I can list SEVERAL subjects for which they act contrary to the American public's wishes, is something else.\n (And I admit in advance there are probably some examples of Democrats who act contrary to majority wishes.)\n\n I am familiar with the arm twisting maneuver that was attempted. I am not even saying that such a maneuver is dirty or unfair. All that I am suggesting is that having to use that particular maneuver indicates that the legislation is, in fact, not supported by an overwhelming majority either of Congress specifically, or people generally.\n \n Now, we can consider this in two contexts: an overwhelming majority support in Congress, and an overwhelming majority support in the greater national population. I submit that neither exists. If an overwhelming majority of Congress supported the legislation, then there would be no need to try to try an use legislative arm-twisting. Rather, the legislation would pass overwhelmingly on its own merits. What actually happens when unrelated bills are attached to must-pass legislation is that the said bills do not enjoy substantial support.\n \n But you indicated that you meant the legislation was supported by an overwhelming majority of people. I disagree. Your support your conclusion by citing that an overwhelming majority of people support \"hate crimes\" legislation. I won't bother to decide whether that is actually the case; I will simply assume it to be true. Overwhelming support for \"hate crimes\" legislation generally does not imply the same support for extending or broadening such legislation. For example, a person may support legislation at the state level, but not at the federal level. An individual may support hate crimes classifications as they currently exist, but not support extending the reach to new classifications.\n \n It is also interesting that you are essentially blaming the Congressional Republicans for being out of step with the majority of people. I'm not sure this instance bears that out for two reasons. First, the reason the Matthew Shepard Act was dropped was because there was not enough support in the House to pass the legislation. They were some 40 votes short, and as the AP reports, \"...many anti-war Democrats said they would oppose it.\" The Democrats have a substantial majority in the House, and there are no procedural blocks that the minority can use in the House. A simple majority wins in the House, and so they could not get enough Democrats to support it through this procedure.\n \n Secondly, why not bring the legislation up on its own merits if it is only Republicans that are balking against the majority tide? Democrats have a substantial majority in the House, and even if every Republican voted against the legislation, the legislation would clear the House 233-202 if every Democrat voted for it. That leaves the Senate, which has the filibuster rule. According to the AP report, it seems that the MSA enjoys filibuster proof support since several Republicans support it.\n \n In short, it is the failure of the Democratic leadership to get this legislation passed.\n \n \nConsidering the American public is not directly involved in this maneuver, I don't see how you could claim the conclusion you do...\n\n Much of this depends on how we define the term \"overwhelming majority.\" For me, legislation that enjoys overwhelming majority support is indicated by a substantial lack of controversy along with a substantial presence of popular discussion. I do not recall one candidate who won election in 2006 discuss the issue of hate crimes. I do not see it as being considered a major issue due to the overall lack of discussion on it in the general populace. I don't even know of a Presidential candidate who considers this a big issue in the campaign.\n \n In short, I took you to be insinuating that a minority of Congressional republicans are stifling the clear an overwhelming will of the people. I do not think that is the case here (given that it was the Democrats who failed to pass it). But, even if that were the case, advocates of majority rule would simply say that, if it was really true that the Republicans were stifling the will of the majority, then they will be tossed out in 2008. We do not advocate that the majority should get its way on every single issue through direct voting. We advocate that the majority should get its way according to the processes that it has set up for itself. Sometimes this is said in shorthand by simply saying, \"the majority should win.\" What is meant is that it should win in accordance with the processes that have been set up.",

Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., was widely supported by Democrats and some moderate Senate Republicans.\"\n And then you try to turn that into \"democrats derail\".\n Funny how you have to speak an essay to avoid one simple sentence... emoticon_xdonno\n\n I assume you understand how the Congressional process works. I assume you understand that there are procedural moves that a minority can use in the Senate to block majority legislation, but that there are no such hurdles in the House. Simple majority wins in the house, 60 vote super-majority wins in the Senate. Hence, if we can show that the super-majority exists in the Senate, then if the legislation is derailed, it is because a majority does not support it in the House. And, if a majority does not support it in the House, this would be due to the fact that a substantial number of House Democrats do not support the legislation, or do not support the procedural end-around which was attempted.\n \n First, let me try to show that the super-majority hurdle in the Senate has been met. From the AP:\n \n \nThe Senate voted 60-39 in September to attach the bill as amendment to the 2008 defense authorization bill. Nine Republicans broke ranks and sided with Democrats in support of the measure.\n\n \n Hence, it was not the Senate that was responsible for derailing the MSA, but rather the House. And the article explicitly states this:\n \n \nCongress has dropped legislation that would have expanded laws against hate crimes to include attacks on gays after it became clear the measure wouldn't pass the House, aides said Thursday.\n\n \n Ok, I have shown that Senate Republicans are not responsible for derailing the MSA. So, it remains to be shown that House Republicans were not responsible for the derailment either. I showed that in my previous posts. There are no procedural blocks available to the minority party in the House. Hence, if every Democrat voted for the legislation, and every Republican voted against it, the legislation would pass 233-202. This was, according to the article, several anti-war Democrats would oppose the measure. Hence, it was the Democrats that were responsible for derailing the MSA this time around, not the Republicans.\n \n \nI already explained why the attachment was made. I saw no real response from you on that.\n Bush has promised to veto the hate crimes bill. To get the hate crimes bill passed, you need to either get Bush to sign it, or you need to get enough support in Congress.\n Not enough Congress Republicans representatives support it to over-ride a veto.\n\n I think this is a side issue from the question of why Congress failed to pass the MSA this time around. It was the anti-war Democrats.\n \n \nThe REPUBLICANS are the major barrier, supplying the majority of votes against hate crime legislation, but to you it's the democrats who are the failure... emoticon_xdonno\n\n More precisely, it is the President who is the barrier, not Congressional Republicans. To fault Republicans simply because enough of them will not support the legislation to give it veto-proof status is somewhat strange given the fact that enough Democrats would not vote for it to even pass it in the first place.\n \n \nThey added the hate crimes legislation to the defense appropriations as a COMPROMISE, but they lost too many democrats in the process because the compromise was unacceptable because of the DEFENSE appropriations.\n Not the hate crimes legislation.\n\n That is exactly what I have been saying. This particular measure failed because of the Democrats, not the Republicans.\n \n \nWould you care to look at the vote for JUST the hate crimes legislation bill?\n And see how many Democrats supported / opposed?\n And how many republicans supported / opposed?\n Cause that's the clearest picture of all, and I think we both know what will be seen when that is done...\n\n I already indicated that a filibuster proof majority in the Senate exists, and that Republican support/opposition does not matter in the House. And I disagree that just because enough Republicans will not sign off in order to make it veto-proof makes them responsible for derailing the legislation or subverting popular will.\n \n \nI have no interest in you redefining the English language to pretend you have a point.\n Counting heads in this nation, over 50% approve of hate crimes legislation. That's a majority. It's a simple mathematical definition, right?\n \"Overwhelming\" may be a little vague, but I've given numbers. You have given NONE. So I really don't know how you can balk at that...\n \n So I really don't care how you try to argue we should define \"overwhelming majority\", cause when it comes to a \"democracy\", a lot of your redefinition attempts are meaningless...\n Does \"democracy\" hinge upon how badly people want a thing? Or instead on whether they want versus don't want the thing?\n\n There really isn't enough reliable polling out there. All I can find are two polls. And please hear this part: it is not even my point to show that a majority does or does not support the legislation. It is my point to show that just because legislation that enjoys majority support is not enacted does not mean that majority rule is being stifled. I am taking issue with the following statement:\n \n \nI have no doubts that those who regularly champion \"democracy\" when it comes to anti-gay issues will be thoroughly silent for insisting that a piece of legislation, which has overwhelming majority support, was not enacted.\n\n My point is that championing democracy broadly does not imply that a person believes that the majority should win in particular cases.\n \n Said another way, I contend that the above statement is a strawman.",

   "But I've got time to state that my before statement was not a strawman.\n It was referencing particular posters who have championed democracy.\n \n And it is a valid argument, as noted, because the \"democracy\" is consistently championed when the \"anti-gay\" side has a majority, but never when the \"pro-gay\" side has a majority.\n On the latter, conspicuously absent.\n \n You are not the poster I was referring to. Let me explicitly state that the above comment was NOT referencing you.\n\n I understand this, and I think I can gather who it is you are referring to. My point is that it is not surprising that a poster champions democracy when referring to gay marriage and the Constitution, but does not get up in arms when a majority does not \"win\" in the hate crimes scenario. Now, I'm betting you would agree that it is not surprising. But whereas I am not surprised by such a position because I believe it to be consistent, I would guess you are not surprised by it because you perceive it to be inconsistent because the common denominator, as you perceive it, is anti-gay bias (that's a guess on my part, by the way). I'll try to further explain that in the following.\n \n \nMoreover, I find your phrase fascinating: \"...majority should win in particular cases\"\n This discussion has seen no reasons presented for why the majority should not win for hate crime legislation.\n I acknowledge that some people may object, like I didn't vote for Bush in 2000, but the will of the majority should be reflected. And being opposed to the majority is obviously not the same thing as saying the majority should not win.\n \n Do you have any reasons for why the majority should not win on this particular case?\n\n People who champion democracy (including the poster who I believe you are referring to) are typically advocating democratic process generally, rather than majority results specifically. I maintain that you can enact policies that are supported by a majority in an undemocratic way, and I also maintain that you can enact legislation that is supported by only a few people that is democratic. That is because I advocate democracy through the specific means of procedure.\n \n For those of us who champion democracy, we do not particularly care about the individual issues being discussed, we care about the way in which those policies are enacted. We believe that policies can be enacted legitimately and illegitimately. We would oppose the illegitimate enacting of policies we vehemently favor, and we would likewise support the legitimate enacting of policies that we vehemently detest. For us, it is about legitimacy, which is only present when a policy is enacted through the proper procedure. So let's examine a couple of cases.\n \n First, same-sex marriage. I maintain that same-sex marriage is not a right protected by the Constitution. Thus, I would hold that the issue is one subject to the normal democratic processes that we have democratically set up in the United States. Currently, this happens to be addressed at the state level where voters directly vote on Constitutional Amendments. I support voting on this issue because doing so is in accordance with the fundamental procedures that we have established in this Nation, and in the individual states.\n \n Second, the hate crimes legislation. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that a majority of people vehemently opposed the proposed hate crimes legislation. If the Congress enacted (and the President signed) the policy anyway, I would not say that this was undemocratic because the process of legitimacy was followed. Likewise, if a majority of people vehemently supported enacting the hate crimes legislation, but the Congress failed to do so, I would likewise hold that this was a democratic result.\n \n I only go through all of this to try and explain why a person may vehemently advocate \"voting on marriage\" on the one hand, and not be so up-in-arms when a majority doesn't get its preference on hate crimes legislation on the other. I do not think it is inconsistent, and I certainly don't think that it demonstrates anti-gay bias.\n \n All of the aforesaid leads me to this final question:\n \n \nDo you have any reasons for why the majority should not win on this particular case?\n\n I would say that, given what I have said above, the reason why the majority should not win on this particular case is simply because the Congress failed to enact it. In other words, the majority should not win in this particular case because it has failed to produce the necessary mechanisms by which the legislation could be enacted legitimately. I know that sounds simplistic and stupid. But for people like me, that is the answer considered purely on democratic grounds. The result is democratic even though it the result is opposite of the majority opinion.\n \n Now, personally, I don't support hate crimes legislation period. I said this above. If I were in Congress I would not vote for this legislation on the merits. I would not vote for any hate crimes legislation on the merits. As I said in one of my previous posts: \"[my opposition] has nothing to do with hostility to anyone. It has to do with hate crimes legislation treating similar crimes differently. I perceive that as unfair.\"\n \n I hope this has sufficiently explained my position, especially as it relates to my belief that advocating democracy on the issue of marriage does not mean that one must be upset that hate crimes legislation has not passed. I figure you may know most of this, and I hope this hasn't sounded condescending in any way. It certainly was not intended to be.\n \n And, finally, since I was listening to my newly acquired Christmas music as I wrote this post, I feel compelled to wish you (and everyone else) a Merry Christmas.",

   "I assume you understand how the Congressional process works. I assume you understand that there are procedural moves that a minority can use in the Senate to block majority legislation, but that there are no such hurdles in the House. Simple majority wins in the house, 60 vote super-majority wins in the Senate. Hence, if we can show that the super-majority exists in the Senate, then if the legislation is derailed, it is because a majority does not support it in the House. And, if a majority does not support it in the House, this would be due to the fact that a substantial number of House Democrats do not support the legislation, or do not support the procedural end-around which was attempted.\n\n democracy:\n 1 a: government by the people; especially : rule of the majority b: a government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by them directly or indirectly through a system of representation usually involving periodically held free elections\n \n bureaucracy\n the administration of government through departments and subdivisions managed by sets of appointed officials following an inflexible routine\n \n I think you support \"bureaucracy\" more than \"democracy\", at least in this issue.\n \n \n \nI think this is a side issue from the question of why Congress failed to pass the MSA this time around. It was the anti-war Democrats.\n\n Suppose you have two conflicting groups who want different things.\n Group A wants Issue #1 passed, but Group B successfully blocks it.\n So Group A attempts to make a compromise on an issue that Group B wants. However, the extent of that compromise is not satisfactory for some elements within Group A, and they lose more support from Group A than they gain from Group B.\n \n Would it be sensical to say that Group A is responsible for Issue #1 being passed?\n I say no, and furthermore it makes no sense to limit the scope to JUST the second part of Group A trying to pass Issue #1.\n Issue #1 wouldn't have come up a second time if it weren't for Group A. The fact that Issue #1 wouldn't have even have been tried a second time if not for Group A should not be lost.\n \n So, no. It is not a \"side issue\".\n We shouldn't lose sight as to why this second attempt had to be tried in the first place.\n And \"this time around\" wouldn't even have existed if it weren't for the democrats...\n \n \n \nMore precisely, it is the President who is the barrier, not Congressional Republicans. To fault Republicans simply because enough of them will not support the legislation to give it veto-proof status is somewhat strange given the fact that enough Democrats would not vote for it to even pass it in the first place.\n\n The Democrats who \"would not vote\" were voting against the \"war\" aspect of the legislation. Not the hate crime issue.\n And if the \"Congressional Republicans\" were truly representative of their base (like I pointed out even a majority of REPUBLICANS support hate crime legislation), we would have our over-ride easy.\n \n You present a scenario where failure to pass the clearly supported bill can see Republicans pointing the finger at each other, while their JOINT refusal goes unaddressed.\n \n \n \nThat is exactly what I have been saying. This particular measure failed because of the Democrats, not the Republicans.\n\n No. You have not been saying that.\n Suppose Jesse wanted to go to the mall to buy crack cocaine and a birthday present for her mother.\n Jesse's father refuses to allow Jesse to go to the mall because the father is against Jesse using drugs..\n And you start in that Jesse's father was responsible for the failure of Jesse to buy a birthday present for her mother.\n \n You keep trying to phrase it to pin fault on the Democrats, while ignoring the bigger issues at play here.\n \n \n \nI already indicated that a filibuster proof majority in the Senate exists, and that Republican support/opposition does not matter in the House. And I disagree that just because enough Republicans will not sign off in order to make it veto-proof makes them responsible for derailing the legislation or subverting popular will.\n\n And again, you ignore the fact that we wouldn't be here if it weren't for the Republicans...\n And you ignore the fact that we wouldn't even have the second attempt if it weren't for the Democrats.\n \n \n \nThere really isn't enough reliable polling out there. All I can find are two polls.\n\n Do we really need to go down this path?\n I can throw poll after poll at you, and you still wouldn't be satisfied, would you.\n Back in \"Clinton's\" day, there were numerous polls on the issue showing a statistical support that, if it existed in Congress, would over-ride any presidential veto.\n Today, there aren't that many polls. I suspect because most people don't need a poll to demonstrate a fact that hasn't changed, and virtually everybody knows.\n \n Moreover, how many polls does a person truly need? If gallup poll does a poll, with their respected name, should we blindly ignore the findings just because we don't have half a dozen more to substantiate?\n \n You don't even try to contest the fact that the majority supports hate crime legislation. You just try to quibble over semantics on the strength of the \"will of the people\" or other meaningless side-notes which don't address the main issue.\n \n \n \nAnd please hear this part: it is not even my point to show that a majority does or does not support the legislation. It is my point to show that just because legislation that enjoys majority support is not enacted does not mean that majority rule is being stifled.\n\n I am sorry, but that is precisely what it means.\n Just because you prize the capability of bureaucracy to stifle majority rule does not negate the fact that the majority of the population is not getting what they want in legislation.\n The procedural bureacracy is not \"democracy\", nor does it blindly excuse \"democracy\" not being implemented.\n \n \n \nMy point is that championing democracy broadly does not imply that a person believes that the majority should win in particular cases.\n\n I'll go a step further from what I mentioned above to another example.\n Once on these boards I opened up a thread to discuss CONSERVATIVE \"judicial activism\". I believe we could agree that such examples would qualify as something champions of \"democracy\" would be against, if \"democracy\" was truly desired.\n Interestingly enough, the people who I referred vaguely to earlier both posted on that thread, but NOWHERE did they ever condemn the conservative judicial activism which superceded \"democracy\".\n To be specific, one of several examples was of Judge Roy Moore ruling that a lesbian mother should not get custody of her child because she was a lesbian. (explicit in his ruling).\n This is something not found in Alabama law, yet Judge Moore took it upon himself to insert his personal bias into law.\n \n So above and beyond my above description of the situation, I see other examples of how people who claim they are for \"democracy\" fall short when the failure to observe \"proper\" democracy and legal channels fall short in favor of \"conservative\" bias.",

Thus, it is possible for a national majority to support a bill, but not enough support from individual constituencies to either pass, or super pass (veto-proof) a bill.

(explicit in his ruling).\n This is something not found in Alabama law, yet Judge Moore took it upon himself to insert his personal bias into law.\n \n So above and beyond my above description of the situation, I see other examples of how people who claim they are for \"democracy\" fall short when the failure to observe \"proper\" democracy and legal channels fall short in favor of \"conservative\" bias.\n\n Well, I tried to find your example, but a quick scan did not lead me to the conclusion you gave concerning the specific issue of judicial activism.\n \n I wonder if we could put on the table who exactly it is you are referring to with respect to their championing of democracy, but only if the results are anti-gay. I have my ideas, but no need for me to speculate.",

   "No, what I support fits nicely under definition 1b of the word \"democracy:\" representational democracy.\n\n I would disagree.\n (I know. Imagine that... :p )\n \"representational\" means that somebody else is there, REPRESENTING you.\n Not representing themselves...\n \n Suppose we had a country where \"elections\" took place. People could \"elect\" who they wanted, but when these people got to their elected posts they continually acted in a way contrary to what the people wanted.\n Is that \"representation\"?\n I say no.\n \n The people in this issue are not \"representing\" the public, but rather catering to their own ideals.\n \n \n \nWhat I said is true. The MSA failed this time because the bill it was attached to did not garner enough Democratic support to be passed. It's that simple. The next time it comes up may be totally different.\n\n While what you said was not technically inaccurate, it was definitely not the whole picture.\n The fact that the second hate crimes legislation attempt wouldn't even have existed if not for the efforts of democrats should not go unmentioned.\n The fact that the reason why this \"compromise\" had to be attempted was because of the Republican elected officials refusing to vote representative of their base also should not go unmentioned.\n \n \n \nI never said that the reason the Democrats didn't vote for the bill was because they opposed the MSA. What I said is that the MSA failed because enough Democrats would not vote for the bill that included the act. I never spoke to why said Democrats would not support it.\n\n And therein lies the problem.\n Leaving out crucial details can lead people to a conclusion that is inaccurate.\n It's interesting how you respond by pointing out what you said was not wrong, without really pointing out what I said which was wrong.\n The truth is that I am giving a fuller picture of the situation...\n \n \n \nFurthermore, it is perfectly reasonable for a bill not to garner enough support to override a veto simply because each House member does not represent the majority, they represent their respective constituents. Thus, it is possible for a national majority to support a bill, but not enough support from individual constituencies to either pass, or super pass (veto-proof) a bill. We have seen this happen in individual elections where the winner of the Presidency did not win the popular vote. This is not a subversion of democracy as we have implemented it.\n\n It is not a \"subversion\" of the SYSTEM we have implemented.\n But let's make no mistake. It is not representative of a \"democracy\".\n \n You are praising the existing system. The procedural red tape which can subvert the will of the people.\n You praise the system.\n I point out that the system is not the same thing as \"democracy\".\n \n \n \nI have not ignored anything. All I have done was state a fact: the MSA failed this time because of Democrats, not Republicans. That fact is not altered by past actions, and it will not be altered by future actions.\n\n You repeatedly refuse to address any other focus but the one you are fixating on.\n The one focus that can blame the Democrats.\n \n Can you deny that \"this\" attempt would not have been necessary if the Republican representatives, both Congressional and Presidential, had voted in accordance with actually representing the wishes of the American public?\n \n \n \nI don't contest the fact because it is not my point to establish whether a majority supports or opposes it. It is only my point to say that, even though a majority might support it, democracy is not subverted if it fails to be enacted.\n\n You are confusing our system, which includes red tape and procedural ploys which can subvert the will of the people, with \"democracy\".\n Democracy is not served when the will of the people is denied.\n The people in Congress are not \"representing\" the public when they vote contrary to the wishes of the public.\n \n Just because our system allows that to happen does not mean \"democracy\" is still honored.\n The CIA World Factbook classifies our government as: \"Constitution-based federal republic; strong democratic tradition\".\n What you describes is the REPUBLIC in action.\n Not a \"democracy\" representation.",
