   "While watching an episode of Extreme Home Makeover tonight where they helped a Christian camp for special needs children I thought it might be a good idea for a forum like this to post a list of many Christian groups and organizations that help people all around the world. So many posts here are made with the intent of discrediting and vilifying Christians and Christian organizations, that I think it's important to have some balance and to be reminded that so much of Christianity and its followers are about the business of helping people.

Besides, even if it were the case, so what? Why on earth is it so horribly awful for someone actually hear about Jesus or have someone tell them God loves them while they are handing them a bag of food or aid package? It's not like that's a terrible thing. \n \n I've found that many people in other countries aren't nearly as paranoid about hearing something like this as some in America (such as yourself) have gotten to be. I for one would rather see my kids grow up not minding to hear religious messages but thinking on their own, rather than being completely intolerant of them. That's just not a healthy thing. Hearing a religious message is often simply someone talking about what's going on in their life. It's not going to hurt you, I promise. They won't bite.\n \n \nYou need to stop thinking that evangelicals are the only group that engages is evangelism.\n\n \n And you need to stop thinking all evangelicals are identical. They are a VERY huge and varied group, and many certainly would not give out aid with evangelical strings attached. I'm living proof of that, because I'm evangelical and I don't evangelize when I give aid or help others.",

It's right there in my post.\n \n There is a problem with handing out aid with one hand and the bible with the other, and that is that it becomes too much like bribery. People end up converting not because they believe in God but because they want to keep getting help, and they think the Bible and the food come as one package. I have no problem with missionary organisations, I have some good friends who worked for them, I have no problem with Evangelical aid organisations. What I have a problem with are the two in the same group, there is a conflict there.\n \n Despite what you seem to think, I am not in America, nor have I ever have been. I am also a Christian, again despite what you seem to think. I am, however, suspicious of evangelicalism, I know not all evangelicals are the same but too many are. I've had quite enough of the evangelical christian union at my university dropping the evangelical when it's convenient for them, and trying to recruit vulnerable international students, particularly from China, who are alone in a foreign country for the first time. It just plain unethical. I have no problem with people communicating the word of God to people on equal terms, but when you involve situations where one person has power or influence over another then it starts to become coercion.",

I'd say the Bible SHOULD come with aid--too often the Bible is preached and no attention is given to humanitarian effort. I think it's GOOD for the 2 to be associated together. You're talking as if evangelism is harming them, or that they have to give up something. If they said \"give me some cash\" or \"come and do my laundry\" I'd say yes, that's bribery. But asking them to consider Christ and hear a message? No. That's not bribery. Now if a group only gave aid if a person became a Christian, then I'd say that would be wrong. But I know of NO group that does that. You're aversion to this is wrapped up in your disdain for evangelism, not because of any rational reason it's bad. Unless you can truly show where people are harmed by hearing the gospel. \n \n \nI have no problem with people communicating the word of God to people on equal terms, but when you involve situations where one person has power or influence over another then it starts to become coercion.\n\n \n Again, if becoming a Christian were a prerequisite for getting aid, I'd agree with you.
