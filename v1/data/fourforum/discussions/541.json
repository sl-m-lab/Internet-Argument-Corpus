   "Basically, there was a cosmic space ruler named Xenu. His people inhabited many planets, and they all had way too many people (hundreds of billions). So, he decided to fix the overpopulation problem. He packed up a ton of these people and put them on Earth next to volcanos. Then, he dropped hydrogen bombs on them, killing them all. Those killed, called thetans, had their souls bunched up in groups. These soul chunks inhabit everyone and are the cause of mental and physical problems. \n \n Through various processes, Scientology attempts to rid people of the thetans, and thus, their problems. Of course, to become 'Clear' requires a fair amount of money. \n \n It's hard to get much information about Scientology because the Church of Scientology is very secretive. Their 'scriptures' are copyrighted and whenever anyone tries to reproduce even a small part, they are sued. People who abandon the CoS usually don't want to talk about it for fear of being harrassed.",
