And prohibitionists seem to be reinforcing the poor parent syndrome, where the parents are not involved enough in their children's lives, causing many of these problems.

Why add another problem into the mix?\n \n There's a huge problem with Marijuana use, especially here in Canada, and my making it legal doesn't solve the problem, or help the war on drugs. \n \n People will get behind the wheel while being as high as a kit and they will kill because your reaction time is greatly hindered. The organized crime that comes along with it is too big of a rise as well, especially if you decriminalize. The business of producing and distributing Marijuana is a good business and if you make it easier for people to get away with possessing it and using it then you will open the doors for more organized crime, which equals more production, and larger organized crime organizations; which will bring about other organized crime activity. \n \n Marijuana is very addictive, in the psychological sense. And is harmful to the human body. When you smoke up, the smoke goes into the lungs and then is transfused into the blood stream. When this happens the smoke takes up some of the place of oxygen. Then the blood is sent to the brain. How can it possibly be any good to deprive your brain of oxygen?\n \n Also im not exactly sure how old some of you are but the drug isn't the same as it once was. Back in the 70's the active ingredient, THC, made up about 2% of drug. Now it makes up 15%, and it's only getting higher (pun intended)\n \n The drug can also easily be lased with other extremely harmful substances. \n \n The point here people is that by legalizing or even decriminalizing Marijuana doesn't help anyone, and only creates more problems.

   "Not sure why I'm posting here as many of the posters are completely ignorant of all this.\n \n I smoked pot in high school. Big deal. Was it easier to get than alcohol? Maybe a little, but I could get either whenever I wanted. I hope my children also enjoy their lives, smoke a little pot now and again, eat a little steak, have some beer, smoke a cigar, etc. This is how I was brought up.\n \n Am I a degenerate? I certainly hope not. I am a Nuclear Engineering major at probably the most prestigious school in the country, which must go unnamed. Of three of my absolute best friends in high school: The one who smoked the most pot now goes to Princeton; he is brilliant. The one who smoked pot and did a whole host of other drugs passed more AP (advanced placement) college exams than anyone in America, ever. As soon as he graduated high school, he was a senior in college. The other smoked a large amount, and now attends an ivy league school as well (Brown). I no longer smoke pot, but a lot of my friends do, and I probably will again when I am older (possibly retired).\n \n I have yet to understand where all this anti-marijuana sentiment comes from. Rather, I know where, I just can't make sense of it. It's generally middle-aged people (women in particular) who seem to associate pot with gangs and violence. The truth is the opposite. Pot reduces violent tendencies (if you ever smoke it you would know this without question). There is absolutely no evidence that driving while stoned increases one's risk of getting into an accident. NONE. In addition, whatever societal negatives you are trying to conjure up would be far outweighed by the enormous tax revenues the government would make off selling the drug.\n \n To say that marijuana is addictive is wrong to the point of hilarity. We know it isn't physically addictive. To say that it is psychologically addictive is to say that you enjoy doing it. So, it shouldn't be allowed because it is psychologically addictive is the same thing as saying: \"you shouldn't be allowed to do it because you will enjoy it.\" If that doesn't make you chuckle, we've got problems.\n \n Also, I don't know if you realize this or not, but THC has in no way been proven to be harmful in any long-term sense. Sure, SMOKE is harmful. Not THC. You can use a vaporizer to extract only THC from the marijuana and it becomes completely harmless health-wise. You people with a stick up your butts probably do not know this.\n \n The number of drugs that are much worse for you that America's and Canada's governments are too inept to criminalize are many. Just go smoke some purified salvia and tell me it ought to be legal. Yet you can buy it at virtually any herbal market or florist. If you purify it, which is legal, and smoke it, which is legal, you will hallucinate and temporarily go insane. MANY other similar such drugs exist in our country. And here we are debating something harmless, while you ignorant marijuana haters just keep going. So sad. Public ignorance always is.

   "Also, I saw some discussion about religion and pot. Well, I am a practicing Roman Catholic. I am not even close to perfect. But, if there is one thing I don't lose sleep over, it's having smoked pot. I'd do it again if my lifestyle supported it. The fact is that the only reason my religion tells me that smoking pot may be sinful is because it is breaking the law. And even this doesn't necessitate it as sin. Now, Catholicism is a pretty darn large religion, and nowhere in the Bible, nor in Church doctrine, is there anything that has yet to make me believe that smoking pot is inherently sinful. Thus, I have no reason to believe most other Christian doctrines have pot listed as one of their nono's. I'll warrant there are some, such as Mormonism, but not many. As I said in my other post, I was brought up to enjoy life as God created it, and marijuana is simply another herb that one may choose to enjoy. Moderation? Yes. Inherent sin? Ridiculous.\n \n I truly do not believe that \"sin\" is what is keeping pot illegal. It is mere politics and the ignorant fear of the masses. Pot is \"of the devil,\" they secretly believe, yet nowhere can one find evidence for such white trash garbage.\n \n Evan, lemme give you a little advice. Find a friend who smokes, take a couple drags, and enjoy yourself. Then come tell me it's a big deal.\n \n At the risk of going off on a rant, I'd like to add another thing. The only reason pot is associated with crime is because it is a criminal act. Do you understand this?? That is why \"shady hoodlums\" are the ones with the pot. Whose who are willing to risk breaking big-time laws are the ones supplying it. If it were legalized, all this nonsense about the \"bad kids doing pot\" would fall by the wayside and you all would wake up and realize the drug does nothing more than create a harmless, benevolent high. NOTHING. It does not make you stab your parents, or rob a jewelry store, or steal money from a fifth grader, or get into fights, or .... and the bs-list goes on. My guess is that the only reason this mis-association ever came about is because the inherent nature of making any substance illegal prerequisites the fact that a criminal must be the one who obtains it. Remember when alcohol was illegal in America? Next thing we knew it was those pesky ole' mobsters killing people by the dozen to supply alcohol. Those were the \"shady high-schoolers\" of alcohol. Hah! Now look at what we have today - no more black-market killings to obtain it! And the funny thing is that the negative effects of alcohol could be seen, legal or not! You still had your drunks, your moderate drinkers, your party animals, and your dry-mouths. What we have here is a misunderstanding due to confusing association with causality - NOT the same things!

   "Your logic makes no sense... we have a drug problem so we'll just legalize the drug and BAME, no more problem... by legalizing it more and more people would be getting into it and smoking more of it. \n\n \n Yes more people would get into it. However they would be educated not to abuse the drug and take it in small doses.\n \n \nCausing more and more cases of drugging and driving.\n\n \n They could just as easily drink and drive, it's actually more harmful.\n \n \nAlso the market in the marijuana right now is huge for Organized Crime, and they won't go away just because the government is involved, the profit is to high. In fact they'll try competing with the government and will be able to win by providing a product with a higher potency and cheaper prices if you tax the XXXX out of it, as you proposed. \n\n \n Firstly, they will not be able to sell the drugs that cheaply because they are buying them from illegal sources, as opposed to the government buying in bulk. Also the tax wouldn't be huge because of the large number of people that smoke it.\n \n Secondly the police will not need to arrest 'druggies' on the streets so they can go after more dealers.\n \n Thirdly using that logic no one would buy cigarettes as they can get ilelgally smuggled imports cheaper than they do at the shops.\n \n Fourthly, did the prohibition of alcohol in America mean organised crime or more organised crime?\n \n \nWe also already have a massive problem with people going out and drinking and driving, why do you want to add to it. As i stated when you legalize it your pretty much opening the flood gates and providing it to even more people, raising the chances of drugging and driving, therefore creating a bigger problem. \n\n \n Drinking under the influence of marijuana is less harmful than drinking under the influence of alcohol.\n \n \nAlso it will not change the fact that Marijuana leads to other drugs. Druggies like the high, and after awhile they will want to try something that provides a bigger high. It doesn't matter wither or not it's legalized or not.\n\n \n That's exactly what happens if drugs *aren't* legalised. Dealers get the addicts started on marijuana and then get them addicted to harder drugs. By making sure that smokers do not go to the dealers to get their drugs, you break the link between marijuana and hard drugs.\n \n Also there will be less dealers because the police will be going after the serious criminals rather than a junkie with a spliff in his pocket.",

   "Alright, well theres so much to say here... This is for Snakespit and Oliphant \n \n \nI never said it did sound safe while driving. I firmly believe that pot should be legal for adults to buy, and regulated in the same respect as cigarettes or alcohol. However, just as with alcohol, I advocate responsible use and sober driving. What exactly would be your objection to me sucking down a joint on my couch in the privacy of my own home? \n \n BTW: Alcohol is a causative agent in many of the motor vehicle accidents I go to, as well as many of the assaults, domestic violence scenes, and falls. I can't count on both hands the number of drunks I have dealt with over the last month. I can however say with certainty that I have not been to one call over the last month where marijuana was the problem. In fact, in over 13 years of EMS experience, I can honestly say that I have been to less than 10 calls where marijuana has been the problem. It happens, but not that often. Do you advocate prohibition of alcohol as well?\n\n \n First off, Snake dude, you admitted that the drug slows reaction time and causes sedation. you may sit there on your couch and smoke up, but come on! that's not going to be the case with allot of people. People will get in a car and will drive while under the influence of the drug. Also, if you legalize the drug this occurrence will happen much more often. Also you stated that alcohol cause much more problems... umm... why is that? Could it be because its readily avaible. Now im not advocating prohibition because it will never work and it didn't work because the people had already had a taste of what it was like to have alcohol. Once you give the public something like that they will not give it up. Now if we were to legalize marijuana you would most definitely see a rise in situations where marijuana was a contributing factor. Also you say that it should only be given to adults... lol i don't know how long ago you were a kid but kids don't care whats only suppose to be for adult and whats not, they'll get it one way or another. \n \n \nAt the risk of going off on a rant, I'd like to add another thing.

But I've no doubt I'd have as much luck as telling these things to a brick wall...\n\n \n Secondly in response to Oliphant. Now your right about a couple of things... Its not the Big boys supplying it that do the drug, its the little pot head who of course don't go around stabbing people. I don't think anyone ever said that it caused violent acts.... But let me clear something up because your deeply confused, i don't know if that's from your smoking years or you just want to justify \"the good times\" you had. But its not only considered criminal because its a criminal act, its also strongly assisted with organized crime. Now its organized crime that supplies this stuff, and its a huge profit for them. And its a completely different situation then prohibition. Why? because you want the government to supply it! Government won't be able to compete with the product that organized crime will provide. Organized crime will be able to deliver a variety of different variations of the product, high potency, and they will be able to compete with government prices because of the taxes. The only reason why Organised crime couldn't compete with prohibition was because they couldn't commit with business' prices of alcohol, organised crime will compete and will win with government because government will regulate and tax the XXXX out of it. And i know what your saying \"well ah, we'll just not tax it..\" come on, we know very well that the government can't help its self, not to mention that if it is legalize that it will be done by a liberal and its in there nature to tax. Also when you legalize it you will be opening the flood gates to more and more users and consumers. And the ones that already do it will do it more; only making a larger consumer base for the organized crime, and will also allow for larger organized crime set ups, resulting in higher violent acts created by organized crime.",

   " you admitted that the drug slows reaction time and causes sedation. you may sit there on your couch and smoke up, but come on! that's not going to be the case with allot of people. People will get in a car and will drive while under the influence of the drug.\n\n Actually, I know a lot of people who smoke marijuana, and the majority of them do enjoy it in their homes, and are responsbile enough to not go out and drive when they get baked. It is simple common sense and maturity. Yes, some will get in their cars and drive, but this already occurs far more often than you realize. You seem to be oblivious as to how many people in this country smoke marijuana. \n \n \nAlso, if you legalize the drug this occurrence will happen much more often.\n\n And you base this on what? Or are you just telling us what you think will happen? Marijuana is already so commonly available that it is simple to obtain. With it's common availability it is not hard to realize that if someone wants to get high that they can do so without difficulty. I doubt that we would see a significant increase in DUI of marijuana simply by legalizing it. Look to Amsterdam...decriminalization and government control of marijuana seems to have worked well. I have not heard of a significant increase of traffic accidents and fatalities there. \n \n \nAlso you stated that alcohol cause much more problems... umm... why is that? Could it be because its readily avaible.\n\n And yes, prohibition seemed to stop people from obtaining alcohol. Sure you're right. emoticon_rolleyes Alcohol causes more problems for a variety of reasons. \n 1. It is far more harmful to the body than marijuana.\n 2. Alcohol causes changes in mood and affect not common to marijuana, namely violent and irrational behavior. \n 3. Alcohol is far more debilitating than marijuana in acute intoxication. We have all seen people drunk to the point where they cannot talk, walk, see straight, or even form a complete sentence. I have never seen someone high enough on marijuana to cause these problems. I do not advocate driving under the influence of marijuana any more than I would alcohol. But to say that someone who is high is as dangerous as someone who is drunk behind the wheel is irresponsible and simply wrong. \n \n Marijuana is already readily available. We have not seen the problems with pot that we have seen with alcohol.\n \n \n Now im not advocating prohibition because it will never work and it didn't work because the people had already had a taste of what it was like to have alcohol. Once you give the public something like that they will not give it up.\n\n Then you are a hypocrite. You advocate continued prohibition of marijuana based on the fact that legalization will make our roads more dangerous due to an increase of people DUI of marijuana. So in your mind, less people smoke up and drive because we have a prohibition against marijuana. So following your logic, if alcohol was prohibited and \"less available\", fewer people would DUI of alcohol, making our roads vastly safer. Yet you do not advocate prohibition of alcohol, and even state that you do not believe prohibition works. Which is it? Sad news, people already have a taste for marijuna even though it is prohibited. I agree with the statement that prohibition does not work.\n \n \nNow if we were to legalize marijuana you would most definitely see a rise in situations where marijuana was a contributing factor.\n\n Again, based on what? Do you have any examples or research to back up this statement? Or are you guessing?\n \n \nAlso you say that it should only be given to adults... lol i don't know how long ago you were a kid but kids don't care whats only suppose to be for adult and whats not, they'll get it one way or another.\n\n They already do. Legalize marijuana, remove more of the street dealers, and make it more difficult to obtain on the street. Don't see too many moonshiners around these days...",

Marijuana is a soft drug, in my opinion less harmful to our bodies and society as a whole than alcohol. Users of marijuana are not people that typically make life difficult for others. Crackheads, heroin addicts, alcoholics, meth users, coke heads etc... generally are the people causing the biggest problems, and often people who commit many of the real crimes in our society. We could refocus our efforts at these people, and leave the harmless pot smokers alone. \n \n I for one would pay a little extra in the way of sales taxes to buy marijuana legally rather than buy it on the street illegally.",

   "Should marijuana be legalized?\n \n No\n \n Should marijuana be decriminalized?\n \n Yes\n \n I have had bouts of marijuana usage ranging from once every few months to daily. In the last few years I have all but stopped buying it for myself but will still gladly leech off of a circulating bowl. Any semi-intelligent person, who has used a fair amount of both marijuana and alcohol can attest that alcohol is indeed much more harmful (especially acute short term effects); this has already been debated thoroughly, so I won't touch it.\n \n First off I will say that it really doesn't bother me much that marijuana is illegal. It has an apparant legality to it that is enough for me; with the exception of waving an ounce around on a busy public street, it feels pretty legal. Essentially, marijuana is legal to smoke in private. Certain privacy laws almost guarentee this aspect.\n \n Decriminalization: Its simple.. we are wasting billions upon billions of dollars in jail fees and enforcement for something we cannot stop. DARE is a joke and may even entice more usage. I'm too lazy to put some links to the piles of proof out there, but if somebody questions it I might have to. \n \n A system that disses a harsher punishment to a drug dealer than a rapist or murderer clearly has its priorities crooked.\n \n Legalization: Simple Economics.

Also, there will be more demand because it will be more readily accessible, plus yes prices will rise, i never said they wouldn't. As you said that's basic economics.

Some people spend all their money (and their family's money) on cigarettes. Why are they legal? Oh yeah, I forgot about the tobacco companies.\n\n When we're talking about other drugs and the effects they have on the families we're talking about death. People OD on drugs all the time and the impact that has on their family is great. In the case of Marijuana i understand it would take a 100,000 joints to OD. However it does seem to have an effect on you school life. IT effects your short term memory which will cause you not to retain the information being given to you, and it appears to me that the people at always take the drug are the same people you never seen in class. Anyways the point was that Marijuana will act as a gateway drug to those drugs that will end up killing you.\n \n \nSo would you be for a law saying that anyone currently under 18 can never smoke or drink, because they haven't been introduced to it yet? Then when today's adults are dead, we completely illegalize cigarettes and alcohol. Sound good to you? No, because a person's freedom comes before the government telling them not to harm themselves.\n\n Of course not, and for the same reasons as before.

Now, now, I know how much you hippies hate that point \"no its not no its not\", I've heard it before... although 10mins later the guy starts telling me about how he did meth and coke..... \n\n \n Oh I've been waiting for someone to try to use that argument. The reason that marijuana was pegged a \"gateway drug\" is because most everyone who's tried harder drugs used marijuana first. However most everyone who's tried marijuana has tried alcohol and/or nicotene first. Does that mean alcohol is a gateway drug? Taking it even further, most everyone who has tried alcohol and/or nicotene has tried caffiene first. Does that mean caffiene is a gateway drug? \n \n I've used pot and have had no desire to use any harder drugs. 95% of the people I know who use or have used pot have never taken any harder drugs. Here in Alaska it is legal to grow and posess up to one ounce of marijuana for personal consumption. I promise you that a very large percentage of Alaska residents smoke pot on at least a semi-regular basis, and I promise you that you'd never be able to pick them out of a group. They look, act, and dress like anyone else. They have jobs like anyone else. They have kids. Many are business owners. Yet we don't seem to have the huge social problems with marijuana as you would predict. We haven't had any rash of organized or un-organized crime. We haven't had any increase in motor accidents. There hasn't been any public outcry to re-criminalize it. The involvement of alcohol in crimes still far outweighs the involvement of marijuana in crimes. The only real difference between here and any other state is that no-one has to worry about getting arrested for having a joint in their home. \n \n I quit smoking pot and drinking both completely of my own volition. It had not been having any sort of noticable effect on my health problems but I quit because I didn't even want to take the chance they could, and I didn't want symptoms and medication side-effects that I have been trying to keep track of to be clouded by effects from other substances. All of my doctors were aware of my usage before, and none of them had any reservations about it. I don't crave either one very much, but I miss alcohol more than I miss pot. I have no plans to take up either one again, even if pot were to go fully legal, and the idea doesn't bother me. I'd be pretty upset if I had to give up sugar for health reasons, but pot? Nah. I like it, sure, but I can take it or leave it. I really don't see what the big deal about it is, and I find it pretty telling that no-one else here who's used it before sees the big deal with it either.

The old truism that one buys in his own language and sells in the language of the customer is understood.\n \n It's more that we Dutch are generally considered brand-loyal, so once a company or store has built up a customer base, it'll generally be allright (bar scandals, intolerably bad customer care or outrageously high prices), the result is that storeclerks aren't as obsequious as they may be in comparatable sectors in other countries where companies have to fight harder to keep their customers, add in that we already have a reputation of being some of the rudest, most direct people in the Western world and expats and tourists sometimes find the dealing with government and retail the most memorable event in their stay here, and not in a good way.",

And since you brought it up...it would take about 1,500lbs consumed in 15 minutes to kill someone, not 20,000lbs. \n \n The estimated lethal human dose (LD50) of intravenous Marinol is 30 mg/kg (2100 mg/70 kg). Using this estimation of lethal dose, the equivalent inhaled THC would represent the smoking of 240 cannabis cigarettes with total systemic absorption of the average 8.8 mg of THC in each cigarette.\n \n In other words, the LD50 would be approximately 2112mg in one sitting.

   "Yeah Easy, not exactly sure who you are hanging out with, but the people that I know who use marijuana typically are not the trouble-maker type. I have never seen anyone high on marijuana get violent, I have never seen them out robbing banks, and they don't typically ever try to push their maijuana on others. The people I know who use marijuana typically don't use other drugs, some don't even use alcohol (which is far more harmful than marijuana...yet somehow still legal). They are some of the most intelligent and creative people I know. Many of them hold down professional careers in many different industries.\n\n \n absolutely. how often do you hear of someone smoking marijuana and then beating his wife? never. he would probably rather give her cuddles. but to be fair, there are people who try to push marijuana on others, theres always people who push anything onto others. theres people who try to push people into not drinking or smoking cigarettes. its just the people you choose to hang out with that matters. there are always some that will be completely cool with how you choose to live your life. those are the people i would rather hang out with. - philosophy moment.\n \n \nWhen you have a room full of people smoking dope, somebody is always there saying, \"Try this (or that)\".\n\n \n thats because marijuana is illegal! how often do you go to a wine tasting party and see waiters walking around going \"excuse me sir, would you like to try this?\" and offer them a line of coke? that would be hilarious but it doesnt happen. \n \n \nSome of them want you hooked so they can make money off you.\n\n \n thats because marijuana is illegal! make marijuana legal and that will stop the weirdos from selling it in alley ways.\n \n \nGuys will try that with girls to get them high and in the sack.\n\n \n you clearly have a misunderstanding of the effects of marijuana. someone who smokes weed will be conscious and aware, just slower and more calm than usual. so that wouldnt work if the girl didnt want to.\n \n and besides, how often do you hear of this instance happening with alcohol? all the friggen time! and that's legal.\n \n also, easyrider. just because i dont need a book to remind me whats right and wrong (i figured it out myself, thank you) doesnt mean i dont have an objective moral basis.",

   "The fact is that there is a disproportionate amount metal illness in young pot smokers.\n Symptoms can range from depression to psychosis.\n Whether pot exacerbates illness, reveals pre existing mental illness or creates mental illness does not matter.\n\n I do agree that marijuana can lead to earlier development of mental illness in people that use it during early adolescence, but I believe that most often these are people with underlying mental illness in the first place. Many scientist and psychologists have raised the question if these teens are using marijuana in an attempt to \"self medicate\". \n \n At any rate, the current policy of prohibition does not seem to keep marijuana out of the hands of our youth. In fact, it most likely makes it far more available. It sure is a good thing that I don't advocate the use of marijuana by children...isn't it? \n \n \nNo I am not talking about gathered and compressed trichomes from the cannabis plant.\n If anyone tries to sell you a lump of hashish by your definition and it costs less than bud it. Dont believe them.It will be the stuff that I know.\n I am talking about a solid lump of ' cannabis' resin which I believe is ( but do not actually know or care) reconstituted cannabis resin with cannabis oil and other junk.\n\n First off, I would never buy anything from \"anyone\". If I were going to buy something, I would get it from someone I know and trust. Second, if you are talking about just plain resin...a black, almost tar-like chunk of material...why would anyone smoke that in the first place? What is commonly known as \"resin\" by most marijuana smokers is the residue that is left over after combustion of marijuana. It is a sticky tar-like substance that they scrape from the inside of their pipes and bowls. It has a relatively high THC content. \n \n I follow a general rule in life: If I can't identify it, I leave it alone. \n \n \nWhy do you think making cannabis a cottage industry would make the violent criminals give up drug trading and take a proper job?\n\n It's not about them giving up drug trading or getting a proper job. I could care less what they do. \n \n The reason drugs are in the hands of gangs and cartels is that they are illegal. Perhaps it is a difference between the US and GB that you just don't see. Over here, a majority of marijuana is smuggled up from Mexico and South America by cartels, and then sold by gangs. Needless to say, their practices are less than admirable. \n \n There are growers in California and Colorado (just to name a few) that sell their products to cooperatives and dispensaries for the medical marijuana industry. They are above ground, tax-paying citizens who don't carry guns, don't shoot people in drive-by's, don't sell their drugs to kids, and don't fund any such violence through the sale of their products. If dispensaries were legally allowed to sell to adults...where do you think that the vast majority of Americans would buy their marijuana from? \n \n It's not about what the criminals do, it's about what we do to the criminals. Brigning marijuana above ground would put them out of business. Believe me...street gangs and drug cartels do not want to see marijuana legalized.\n \n \nAs far as I know individuals cannot distill and sell liquor in the US and home made beer tastes like urine.\n\n No we buy our liquors from stores...in my state, I get it from state government run stores. The point was that you stated that it would be cheaper to make them at home rather than buy them in stores, and I agree, it would. Despite this fact, there is little competition for home distilled alcohol in the US. Most of us prefer the convenience, selection, and quality that comes from large scale above ground distillaries. However, the government is not knocking in doors when people home-distill a little alcohol. \n \n And I don't know about you, but some of the best beer I have ever had has been home-brewed beer. I just finished brewing a lovely stout...dark, complex, chocolatey, with just a hint of warm holiday spice notes. I'm going to try the same recipe again, but use more honey this time in the wort. \n \n \nAs much threat as the total freedom to manufacture and trade drugs like zoloft, abilify, prozac, cymbalta, paxil, Adderall, Dexedrine and Ritalin .The drugs that Unkerpaulie mentioned.I would add Viagra and anabolic steroids.\n\n The differences: These are drugs made in a lab. Marijuana is a plant I can grow in my back yard. Nobody ever overdosed on marijuana. Plenty of people have overdosed on the drugs you mentioned. \n \n You're comparing a bottle rocket to a bunch of land mines. \n \n \n \nThen you cannot serious say that the quality of the marijuana that was sold would be any better than the stuff that is on the streets now.\n\n Simple logic tells me I can. Something tells me that the quality of marijuana grown organically in a greenhouse by a reputable gorwer is going to be better quality than that which is sprayed with chemical pesticides and fertilizers and who know's what else, and is smuggled into the country in gas tanks or the asscrack of some Mexican drug runner. Cartels don't care about spider mites in their finished product, a reputable grower does. \n \n \nMarijuana is not tomatoes.\n\n True. One is a plant that I can grow in my back yard that I can cook with, consume alone or with other food products, or place in mason jars and save for later. The other tastes good on salad.",

   "So you concede that marijuana can lead to mental illness in children..whether it it underlying or not is immaterial just as developing cancer from cigarettes does not mean one jot to the victim if they have a ' underlying' tendency to develop cancer.\n\n No, I do not concede that. I agreed that I believe marijuana can expose underlying mental illness, or hasten the symptoms of mental illness, but I do not believe it causes mental illness, nor do I believe that if these mentally ill people had never used marijuana that they would never have become mentally ill. Correlation vs. causation. You have no hard evidence to support your theory, I have no hard evidence to support mine. What I can say is that I do not advocate the use of marijuana by minors, and I believe that prohibition places children at greater risk to be exposed to marijuana. \n \n \nI agree the curent policy does not seem to keep marijuana out of childrens hands.I believe the same goes for other even more dangerous drugs..maybe we should make ketamin,crack and ecstasy legal..maybe even angel dust..is there are market for angel dust?\n You dont advocate it but want to make it as easy or easier for children to obtain it in the future..I dont see much difference\n\n No, I do not want to make it easier for children to get marijuana in the future, and I believe I have made that clear. I believe that the current system of prohibition makes marijuana more available to children, due to unscrupulous dealers who only want to make a profit. \n \n And furthermore, I believe that seperating marijuana from hard drugs such as you listed will decrease exposure to these hard drugs. I work in an envronment where I see drugs all the time. The same guy on the corner that deals pot can also get you crack, meth, coke, or just about anything else you want. It's a no brainer that if people are buying their marijuana at a dispensary, they wouldn't need to be exposed to dealers like this anyway. \n \n \nAs long as it doesnt affect you...\n\n Gangs and cartels affect all of us. I just want them to go away. As I have explained before, it is the war on drugs and the policy of prohibition that keeps them in business. \n \n \nAny free growing and selling marijuana will lead to less than admirable practices . Thats just the way it is.Potheads selling to potheads =less than admirable practices\n\n I was talking about the violence that cartels and street gangs deliver day after day. Perhaps you don't see such in you little kingdom over there, but I see gang violence almost daily at work. I've never known a \"pothead\" to shoot another \"pothead\" who was buying marijuana from him. \n \n \nFrom the guy down the road who grows his own pot in a garage or from a bloke on a street corner..if the price was right.\n\n If legalized, marijuana sold at disrensaries could be cheaper than what is currently available on the black market. Any time you make something illegal and push it underground, you increase it's value to those who want it. If I were going to buy marijuana, I would still rather pay a few bucks more to buy it in a safe environment like a dispensary from someone I trust than to go out and take my chances with the armed gang banger on the street.\n \n \nOnly selling pot from legal dispensaries would be the lesser of two evils though.\n\n If you want to insist that it is an \"evil\". \n \n \nNeither do I.Where the gangs and I differ is on the penalty of selling illegal drugs\n\n If marijuana were taken out of their hands, most would no longer be around. Hmmm...lock people up for causing problems, or make them vanish and eliminate the problems. Hmmmm....\n \n \nProbably because the amount of people doing it is negligable..but I am only assuming this\n\n Probably not. It's because the majority of people who do home distill don't sell their product. They use it themselves, or share it with friends on a social basis. \n \n \nSome of it is palatable but most of it tastes like XXXX.\n\n To each his own. \n \n \nDefine overdosed.Apparently nobody has overdosed on LSD insofar that they died through LSD poisoning.\n\n \n Overdose simply means \"excessive dose\". And yes, actually it is thought that one person (perhaps 2) has died from an LSD overdose, but it requires extraordinarily high doses, and is not easy to do. I am thinking in terms of the work that I do, where overdose means to seriously places one's life at risk via ingestion of a drug or chemical.\n \n \nHow do you guarantee that the product is as good as you say without a quality control inspection?\n\n Many dispensaries do their own quality control. Simple testing is available through labs and much testing can be done right in the dispensary with a few basic tools. But again, simple logic tells us that if marijuana can be cultivated legally, the practices used to grow it will improve. I know a few people who grow their own, and they go t great lengths to ensure that they grow healthy plants organically with no disease or infestation. \n \n Government inspection would only add one more wasteful government beaurocracy to the payroll.
