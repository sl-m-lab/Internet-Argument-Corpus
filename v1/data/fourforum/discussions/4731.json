   "This gay marriage thing is tearing my wife and me apart. Now, because of activist judges in Massachusetts and overzealous officials in San Francisco, our union is hanging on by the thinnest of threads.\n \n Back in the simpler days of 2002, when we were planning our wedding, Jeanne and I used to coo fondly at each other about the joys that lay ahead. It wasn't that we were unsupportive of our gay friends, no. We were just looking forward to the government's validation of our relationship's specialness - a license that affirmed that the two of us had made a unique and personal eternal vow to each other. Something uniquer and specialer than any of our homosexual acquaintances could ever even hope for. \n \n We're all for the separation of church and state, naturally, but if the government doesn't define marriage as the sacred union between a man and a woman, who will? Are Jeanne and I expected to treasure our union solely on the basis of our deep love, personal beliefs, public vows, and the government's blessing? Sorry, Judge Pinkypants, but that's just not good enough. Not for us. We need to know that we've got something that's only available to 90% of the population, the select and upstanding few.\n \n Sure, some of us are criminals. Murderers, even. Some of us have committed rape, beaten children, tattooed swastikas on our bodies, abused animals, broken into houses, bilked the government out of millions of tax dollars, lied under oath, cheated on previous spouses, dishonored our fathers and mothers, failed to keep the Sabbath holy, mowed down pedestrians in our SUV's while intoxicated, coveted our neighbors' stuff, gotten ourselves put on death row, sold military secrets to the Chinese, urinated in public places, beaten up people who looked or sounded different than us, and sold drugs in schoolyards.\n \n But we're straight, and that means we can get married. And that's special. Or, at least it was. Jeanne and I could look around at other married couples - at least the ones that aren't currently dealing with serial infidelity, divorce, spousal abuse, or bigamy - and think to ourselves, \"Yes, that's what we're striving for. That kind of sanctity.\" \n \n Are some gay people serious about their commitment to each other? Sure, of course, that's not the point. Let me give you an example. Jeanne and I know this couple, these two men. They've been together for years and years, longer than we have. They live on a farm in Pennsylvania and treasure their time together. They're loved by their community, have saved lives as members of the local fire department and have opened their home to youth groups from the city. They've built a life together based on love and trust. BUT - and here's my point - they're gay. They're both men. And if they're allowed to marry someday, where does that leave us, my wife and me? See what I'm saying? It'd cheapen everything we have. \n \n And that's not a knock on gay people. No no no. America loves its gays. Look at the TV, with all those funny gay people on \"Will and Grace,\" and \"XXXXX as Folk,\" and \"XXXXX Eye for the Straight Guy.\" They're funny! Funny, colorful people - they're nature's clowns, really. Like penguins.\n \n And we don't allow penguins to marry, do we? No, these are dark times in my household. My wife and I look at each other with haunted, suspicious eyes, feeling like we've bought a whole bunch of shares in a stock that is about to be devalued. Suddenly, the eternal, personal vows that we swore to each other will mean very little. We'll basically become roommates who happen to wear matching rings, while meanwhile out our window we'll see gays and penguins feeding each other wedding cake willy-nilly on our very own street corner.\n \n That's why we need a Constitutional amendment that will protect marriage for straight people. Until we have the right to enter that sacred union, violate it, exit it, and enter it again with somebody else, again and again, regardless of what crimes we commit, until we're too old and feeble to mouth the words, \"I do,\" - unless we have that right and gay people don't, then there is truly nothing sacred in the United States of America.\n http://www.felbers.net/mt/archives/000505.html",

   "Here is a study comparing same-sex marriages to opposite-sex marriages. \n \n Also, here is a fictional testimony detailing why people oppose same-sex marriage.\n\n \n I'm not sure that the findings of that top study are necessarily the reflection of homosexuality at all. I would imagine that the results of the study are not caused by homosexuality but by a more liberal mindset. The mindset of those who accept homosexuality, especially those who engage in it themselves, is more likely to be liberal than conservative; it is less likely to condemn or get angry over the actions of another because it does not see a problem with those actions. I would argue that the conservative mindset enforces the idea that things must happen and be done in a certain manner, and when something outside of that realm of security occurs, they become much more upset over it. If we factor in such ideological differences, we might expect to see the same results in comparing a very liberal-minded opposite-sex couple that we would seeing a same-sex couples. The cause then, may not be the sexual orientation or sexual composition of the marriage, but the mindset of the individuals involved.\n \n As for the second article, it is undoubtedly going to be insulting to some here, but I do think that it brings up a very good point: that there really is not a good reason to deny same-sex marriage. The article hopefully does a good job of showing how the arguments of many who oppose same-sex marriage sound to many who support it; I know I have often felt as that article portrays, that my opponent is stating things in a genuine and concerned tone, yet not really providing a reason to deny same-sex marriage. The implications of such an argument might indeed imply that same-sex couples just aren't real relationships. So when you read that article, try not to get offended if you oppose same-sex marriage. Try to figure out why that article exists and how your view of same-sex marriage is different from what is portrayed there.",

   "But Bob, you're talking in assumptions. They may not be equals. One could be more dominate of a personality. There could be large disparities between income. There are too many factors to make these assumptions. I think when you look at the vast spectrum of relationships gay or straight you will find they are equal. I cannot agree that gay relationships are better nor can I agree hetero relationships are better. How can you fight for equality and then make claims that one or the other is better. That is not logic.\n \n I know plenty of homosexual relationships where the couple are nopt equals.. differing incomes, differing backgrounds, differing moral ethics. ON the same note i know just as many straight realtionships that are not equal. It all comes out in the wash.\n\n \n You did notice the \"on average\" part of what I said, right? And the bit about \"more about equals\"? I'm not suggesting that ALL gay relationships reflect this nor that they should. It remains true, however, that MORE gay relationships than straight relationships involve two people who see themselves as roughly equal, or at least not bound by traditional societal roles based solely on gender. Whether it's because of self-awareness or because two men both adopting traditional roles would lead to a lot of garbage being taken out but very little cooking getting done, gay couples tend to engage in a more balanced, negotiated process of figuring out who is going to do which chores, etc. The very willingness to do so leads to fewer tensions.\n \n It's not such a horrible thing for one kind of couple to learn something from another kind of couple. Equality before the law and in society does not mean that everyone turns out the same.",

Whether or not it's pertient to the current conversation or not.\n \n The objection isn't to you being gay, it's to you ONLY being gay.\n And, quite often, the young immature attention seekers who think they have to justify themselves to 'what ever' are the overt and loud ones. \n Just as like was mentioned about heterosexuals who continue on and on and on about their male (or female) prowess.\n \n I support equality in treatment personally for homosexuals. Support civil unions (for hetero or homos) as well as equal treatment of marriage (for hetero or homos). I support adoption rights for homosexual couples even if I'm a little leary that homosexuality has stronger potential to be a learned behavior as opposed to a genetic predisposition.\n \n But, just as I find slight offense in heterosexuals displaying overt sexual behavior in public, I hold the same mild offense of homosexuals for the same causes. I just don't like social displays of intimacy.\n \n If your family disowns you, sorry. Go off as you said and do your own thing.\n I'm offended by my mothers overt racism and distance myself from her on that issue. Even though I am not involved in a multi-racial relationship or ever was. But, then again, I'd do the same if she was a sports fanatic and I find spectator sports to be annoying in the extream.\n \n If you're asked a direct question, feel free to answer it as fully as your desire. They asked for it. But, do you feel the need to volunteer all sorts of personal information 'Just because'?\n \n I recall several years back having a conversation with a male and I mentioned specifically 'spouse or partner' to him in an open conversation about significant others and ended up recieving an earfull of hateful rants about how he doesn't legally have a spouse since he's homosexual and how dare I mention 'spouse' to him at all. Shouldn't I have 'known' he was homosexual?\n Instead of being something simple, it was a self identity issue and political crusade. Instead of being a individual with a multi-fauceted personality, he was a sterotyped one dimensional cartoon character with a chip on his shoulders the size of a mountain and totally unable to see a natural ally.\n \n But, as for what you volunteer in answering a question...I don't always say 'I went to see the movies with my WIFE...or even children' when asked what I did. Even if that's specifically what I did.\n But, then again, I also would have answered 'Did my taxes.' Not, 'Sat at home wondering how I can cheat the IRS out of some extra money while doing my taxes.' \n Or, I might say, 'Cynthia and I went to the movies'. If they don't know who she is, they can ask. Then the burden of the answer is upon them...they asked specifically for it. emoticon_xangel \n It's tact. Tailoring the answer to the specific questioner.\n \n Lord knows when my Boss asks what I did last saturday, I'd like to respond 'Picked up some hot chic as X bar (who turned out to be your daughter) with my wife, took her home to my house boy and doused ourselves with vegatable oil. Had an orgy and smoked some weed while plotting to steal office supplies and sabotage your car.' Even if none of it's true.\n \n But, as to responding that you went to a gay bar...get over yourself already.\n I've responded doing the same and I'm heterosexual.\n Yeah, I've been to gay bars. So what?\n \n I just find it kind of amazing that just being yourself happens to involve a large dose of 'being gay'.\n A large part of being 'me' is being an *******. But, I don't go about overtly and directly advertising it. It just sort of shines through. You'd have to be extreamly dense not to pick up on it.\n \n Hmmmm. Maybe I should champion ******* rights. We really don't get treated fairly in the world. I mean, people won't be my friend simply because I'm an *******. And, there's this stereotype that's been perpetuated that we can't have a decent relationship with someone else purely because we're *******s.\n I can disprove that easily. I have a fairly decent relationship with someone else (living) who's the polar opposite of me.\n Yep, I'm willing to bet I've recieved far more discrimination due to being an ******* than anyone here's recieved for merely being homosexual.\n I can even be imprisoned for being an ******* to a judge under the stupid contempt of court clause. All perfectly legal. And, let me tell you jail isn't a nice place to visit for any period of time. But, it's hard to not find someone who thinks that all *******s deserve to be there.\n The worst thing is, getting the group of like minded people to organize to fight this rampant discrimination. But, then again, they're all *******s and I personally wouldn't lift a finger to help the lot of them.\n \n So, in conclusion. I'm perfectly willing to accept any homosexual if they're willing to accept me as an *******.\n Want to bet you'd go 'straight' before I'd start being nice?\n \n Note: ******* is equally replacable by jerk, wanker or any other obnoxious and insensitive title.",

Whether or not it's pertient to the current conversation or not.\n\n \n Appearances can be decieving. I do that I agree that most opponents of gay rights tend to be the same people who know only the homosexual who complains about gay rights all the time. But I will argue that most homosexuals do not do this; they just tend to be people that no one realized is gay. I will further say that based on my experience, these people tend to do these things only around people that they aren't good friends with. When you get to know them, they are as multi-faceted as the next person. I also think this sort of behavior is not the result of homosexuality, but the result of the overwhelming feeling of rejection by society and feelings of inequality and oppression. It's a feeling that makes many think that they need to do something about it, they need to show people that someone they know is gay, and that this person really wants equality.

It's relieving to hear this.\n \n \nBut, just as I find slight offense in heterosexuals displaying overt sexual behavior in public, I hold the same mild offense of homosexuals for the same causes. I just don't like social displays of intimacy.\n\n \n Sure, but some people do. I mean, who cares, really? In a sense when I see public displays of intimacy, I'm sad because I'm not seeing anyone myself. But in another sense, I'm glad that those people are happy. I never understood why anyone is offended by public displays of intimacy.\n \n \nI recall several years back having a conversation with a male and I mentioned specifically 'spouse or partner' to him in an open conversation about significant others and ended up recieving an earfull of hateful rants about how he doesn't legally have a spouse since he's homosexual and how dare I mention 'spouse' to him at all. Shouldn't I have 'known' he was homosexual?\n Instead of being something simple, it was a self identity issue and political crusade. Instead of being a individual with a multi-fauceted personality, he was a sterotyped one dimensional cartoon character with a chip on his shoulders the size of a mountain and totally unable to see a natural ally.\n\n \n Sounds like someone who gets too offended over nothing. I understand that gay rights are really important to him, but it's frankly unacceptable to blow up at someone just because they used the word \"spouse\".\n \n \nA large part of being 'me' is being an *******. But, I don't go about overtly and directly advertising it. It just sort of shines through. You'd have to be extreamly dense not to pick up on it.\n \n Hmmmm. Maybe I should champion ******* rights. We really don't get treated fairly in the world. I mean, people won't be my friend simply because I'm an *******. And, there's this stereotype that's been perpetuated that we can't have a decent relationship with someone else purely because we're *******s.\n\n \n Well, to be simple about it, *******s simply do have equal rights. They can get married, they can adopt children... I mean, how are their rights not equal?\n \n Anyhow, I don't think it's fair to compare homosexuality to being an *******, for one is basically an intentional attempt to anger people, to make oneself happier while draining the happiness of others, while the other relates only to individual sexual activity, love, and family.",

It's not about them being \"reactionary,\" but rather a preoccupation (for some perhaps even obsession) with their 'gayness.'\n\n \n I agree with wilted laughter in that the preoccupation with their sexuality that most people seem to have is a result of the fact that they are denied political rights and discriminated against because of their sexual orientation. I can assure you with certainty, that none of us would even be here talking about it if the political rights of homosexuals were precisely the same as those of heterosexuals.\n \n If left-handed people were denied rights, I would imagine that they too would often speak out about the rights they are denied as left-handed people, and they too would seem as though being left-handed is a large part of their identity. If you're a left-handed person who is told that left-handed people are inferior for long enough, and you believe this isn't true, it starts to frustrate you and occupy your thoughts. You feel the need to show people that they're wrong. Again, it is not homosexuality that causes this; it is the rights denied and discrimination faced by homosexuals which causes it.",

   "As to equal rights for gays.\n \n They pretty much have the same rights as heterosexuals do. \n In regards to marriage, they can marry a member of the opposite sex just like heteros can. For some reason, I as a hetero can't marry a member of the same sex...just because.\n \n However, since marriages are no longer arrainged and heteros are allowed to marry a 'person of their choice' for nearly all intents and purposes, I support the ability for homosexuals to do the same. AND, if for some reason, a hetero decideds to marry another hetero...who cares.\n If there are complaints about tax rights, just drop it all from tax law. Keep government out of it. And, I do enjoy tax benifits for being legally married. As do many childless heterosexual couples. \n \n As to adoption. There have been several cases of known homosexuals adopting children. Heck, a gym coach at the local elementary school where my children went adopted a child...she's gay. However, it is easier to adopt if you're married.\n As an adoptive parent of 3 and a person opposed to abortion and institutionalized child care such as orphanages and youth shelters, I support anyone who can pass background checks and family studies being able to adopt. If you're a flaming homosexual who spends all your free time at the bars and engage in risky social behavior with multiple partnets, I'd deny you. But, I'd do the same to a heterosexual who did the same thing with the opposite sex.\n \n As to 'Gay Day' events. While in actuality heteros are also allowed to many of these, when casually mentioned, it smacks of hypocracy on the surface if one is lead to believe that heteros are not allowed.\n Gives the impression that gays don't want equal rights but special attention.\n A good friend several years back, who is gay, was lamenting the issue of discrimination in the work force for homosexuals. Several weeks after his rant, he ended up working for a person in the local mall who ONLY hired gays. A case of obvious reverse discrimination.\n \n \n As to wsm2506's prosecution of the JWs, a good offense is better than a good defense. Prosecuting circumnavigates having to deal with a lawsuit for breaking her fingers while she was on his property. He wins and she loses ground to stand on since her injuries happened while in the commision of a crime.\n Sad it happened but, sometimes it's almost necessary. Might teach her not to be so pushy. Or, it'll justify her beliefs and make her feel all martyr like.\n I've never had much problems with bible pushers being pushy people but, my Irish wolfhound did take a dislike to the JW lady. The only one he's had problems with. Eventually he chased her off after 2 years. But, a 150 lb dog would do that to anyone he didn't like. But, I will give her credit for butting heads with my christian fundy wife for that long. Gave me all sorts of pleasure watching them have theological discussions. emoticon_xangel",

   "I agree with just about everything you said, Zardoz, so I'll make just a few comments.\n \n \nAs to equal rights for gays.\n \n They pretty much have the same rights as heterosexuals do.\n\n \n Remember though that the same rights is not the same thing as equal rights. I think you understand that there is inequality, but I just mean that it is not wrong for someone to say that gays do not have equal rights.\n \n \nA good friend several years back, who is gay, was lamenting the issue of discrimination in the work force for homosexuals. Several weeks after his rant, he ended up working for a person in the local mall who ONLY hired gays. A case of obvious reverse discrimination.\n\n \n It is indeed reverse discrimination, but it is likely that someone would only hire gays in protest of workforce discrimination against them; this would not be a common situation by any measure.",
