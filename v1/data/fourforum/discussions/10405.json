My parents and all of my brothers and sisters are strong authoritarians while I am a borderline anarchist. \n \n Her theory on this (which featured prominently in her thesis) was that since I had traveled extensively in regions where the social order had broken down, corruption was rampant, and the powers that be had grievously abused thier authority to bring untold misery and suffering on those who lived under their power, that despite the fact that I was raised to be a good little authoritarian follower I developed a near pathological aversion to authority. \n \n Take a peak at the link.

That's the bottom line. \n\n \n No evidence except for the multiple independat and bipartisan reports that came at the same time that directly contradicted his.\n \n From a practical standpoint the disagreement is over exactly what Patraeus's job is. His job, as a general in the US army, was to provide the report that represented the views of his chain of command. Essentially, his job was to get up there and further Bushs views and agenda. \n \n Moveon.org incorrectly felt that his job was to get up there and give the most impartial and realistic report he was capable of providing regarding the situation in Iraq. That is simply not the case.\n \n This is actually fairly similar to the charges that floated around regarding Powell after he got up and presented a pack of lies at the UN. He was the secretary of state. His job was to go to the UN and submit the report he was told to submit. Even Powell later said he did not personally believe most of what was in the report, but it did not matter.

But I think attacking a general by distorting his name in a very insulting way, who is not even involved in politics and was just doing his job, is a whole lot tackier.\n\n \n I am going to have to call BS on this one. Patraeus has been heavily involved in the politics of this war for years. It his how he ended up with his job...that and the fact that nobody who was actually qualified was willing to take it. Keep in mind that Patraeus was not their first choice, or second, or even third. He was the 4th guy that they offered the job to. His role as a combat commander stretches clear back to....2003. The guy got where he is by serving as an aid to senior generals. He is nothing but an REMF who ended up leading the occupation of Iraq despite the fact that he has absolutly no experience that would suggest that he is qualified for the job. So how did he get it?? Politics. Since day one of the Iraq war he has been a vocal supporter of every hair brained scheme the Bush administration has tossed out. He has publicly come out and endorsed every idiotic, nonsensical thing they have done. \n \n Basically, after firing everybody who disagreed with them for 7 years, the Bush adminstration appointed a politicized weasel to lead the occuptation of Iraq, and now we are all supposed to pretend to be offended by the fact that he is having to take political flack??? What a joke. Despite absolutly no notable actions since 2004, Patraeus has earned 2 shiny new stars...unless now we are handing out promotions for writing pro Bush war plan editorials for the Washington Post.\n \n I do not know patraeus personally, so my comments are based entirely on the public information available on his service record and the impressions I have gotten from other military or former military officers. The fact that nobody had ever heard of him prior to his vocal support of the Bush administration speaks volumes. I do, however, personally Know Bill Fallon, commander of centcom and almost certainly the most respected military commander in the world. Here is what he had to say about Patraeus:\n \n http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/09/12/report-fallon-derided-pe_n_64169.html\n \n \nFallon told Petraeus that he considered him to be \"an XXX-kissing little chickenshit\" and added, \"I hate people like that\", the sources say. That remark reportedly came after Petraeus began the meeting by making remarks that Fallon interpreted as trying to ingratiate himself with a superior.\n",

   "Ok\n \n Well that didn't last long. :)\n\n \n Are you interested in a serious discussion here, or just playing games? Because it looks like the latter.\n \n \nAnd there's the real crux of the matter. First off, one does not need to be a politician to play politics. Every general in the Pentagon plays politics, it's the nature of the game. And Newsweek has said that the Pentagon's assesment directly contradicts the general's, so we do have evidence that he was just parroting the Bush line. And if he did put politics ahead of the wellbeing of the troops or the nation's interests in Iraq then betrayal is a fair term to use. Harsh, but fair.\n\n \n If you can only rest your case on the idea that he's \"playing politics\" then you've already lost, regardless of what Newsweek has said about the Pentagon. Claiming someone is \"playing politics\" is subjective opinion. In fact it's a statement more along the lines of what Jim thinks about Hillary Clinton, refusing to give her the benefit of the doubt.\n \n \nLying, Jyoshu. It's called lying. Saying something that isn't true, attempting to deceive, slandering. Of course you say stuff about candiates, by why do you conservatives seem to be so ok with lies, even to the point where you just group them in with any other sort of comment as if there were no difference?\n\n \n Kronos, dishonest partisans lie. And that can be a problem among conservatives OR liberals. Your logic is sort of like someone claiming religious people hate black people. Well, no, it so happens that some who hate black people ARE religious, but the two are not the same. Maybe the reason you've been unable to see it among your own is that you just don't like conservatives and want to see it there more. As you said--your own bias.\n \n \nThank you Martha Stewart! Heaven forfend we allow any tackiness! Truth, honor, integrity; these may fall by the wayside. But at tackiness we will draw the line!\n\n \n So if I called you Kronos the Phonos, trying to imply you were a phony, you'd have no problem with such tactics? Maybe most people are just nicer. [shrug] I had no idea that you didn't consider lack of truth, lack of honor, and lack of integrity as tacky.

   "From a practical standpoint the disagreement is over exactly what Patraeus's job is. His job, as a general in the US army, was to provide the report that represented the views of his chain of command. Essentially, his job was to get up there and further Bushs views and agenda. \n \n Moveon.org incorrectly felt that his job was to get up there and give the most impartial and realistic report he was capable of providing regarding the situation in Iraq. That is simply not the case.\n\n \n So I take it you disagree with MoveOn.org's assessment that he was a betrayer? Because you seem to think he was indeed doing his job--following his chain of command.\n \n Part of the problem here is that MoveOn didn't really qualify in the ad what they meant exactly. (Which only further demonstrates it was more about partisan obstructionism and dirty politics.) They just threw their tacky word-play ad up with no explanation in the ad. Given that MoveOn doesn't seem to give much thought to the fact that if we did exactly what they would want and just pull all the troops out ASAP it would be disastrous, we can assume that they feel Petreaus was betraying people by not going along with the idea that the troops should be pulled out immediately. If that's what they consider betrayal, then MoveOn is wrong. \n \n Of course, people who are sentimental toward them usually ignore the fact it was an unethical ad and justify it by saying things like \"it gets people talking about the issue\" or something to that effect (as if people weren't already talking about Iraq and haven't been for years now!).",

The only people who seem to be parroting that are the same leaders who have been wrogn about EVERYTHING related to Iraq so far. They have NO CREDIBILITY, so lets stop repeating whatever BS is coming out of their mouths.\n \n From a practical standpoint, there are only 2 possible outcomes when it comes to the situation in Iraq. First, we can stay until we have gotten the government of Iraq to the point that they have an absolute iron grip over the country...basically stick around until the government is so tyrannical that nobody DARE oppose them. We can ensure that they remain in power, and carry their water, until the very concept of \"rights\" has been completely wiped from the IRaqi consciousness. Basically, we can turn Iraq into another Saudi Arabia. All the while, while we are nurturing and helping this iron fisted, tyrannical government along, Iraqis who do not want to live under a totalitarian religous regime and those who do will continue to kill each other in the streets.\n \n OR, we can leave. If we leave, those who want to live under a totalitarian religous regime and those who do not will continue to kill each other in the street until they work something out, which they eventually WILL. They will end up with a government that everybody can live with, though it will almost certainly not be the western style of democracy that we have tried to shove down their throat since it is incompatible with their religous, cultural, and historical background.\n \n Those are literally the only 2 possible outcomes. Nobody who claims to give a damn about the Iraqis or freedom should even be considering #1. \n \n The simple fact of the matter is that we have screwed Iraq up so badly that we cannot possibly fix it, and every single thing we try to do to fix it is absolutly destined to make things worse.",
