   "Here, in the West, we have had our industrial/technological revolutions and achieved unprecedented prosperity at the cost of polluting the planet and devouring much of its natural resources.\n \n Now, cushioned by a surfeit of consumer appliances, automobility, etc, and a lavish life style made possible by the profligate use of energy, we are in a very comfortable position from which to lecture the \"developing world\" on green issues.\n \n In effect, we are saying to other countries, sorry chum, you must not aspire to our way of life nor follow in our footsteps and add your contribution to the problem of global warming. The resources on which our economies depend are on ration now (even for us) and there's hardly any cake left - so you must do without your share in the interests of preventing an environmental catastrophe that we have made likely.\n \n Isn't this a case of double standards ? The millions with little or nothing must remain in poverty so that the people with the lion's share can ease their consciences about the fate of the planet. Green hypocrisy ???",

The economic incentives and benefits to pollute and industralize outweights the economic benefits of protecting the enviroment. Once a country hits a threshold, that slowly reverses and polluting past a specific point has a higher cost then benefit. Look at Mexico. It is reaching that threshold where industrial polluting is about to be outweighted by the advantages of the enviroment. If the history of every 1st world country holds true, polluting like mad is is the key to industrial sucess, which then leads to higher incentives to protect the enviroment.
