   "High density objects sink faster then low density objects in a Fluid medium\nIn general, I disagree. A piece of granite and a piece of sandstone will hit the bottom of the tower of Pisa at the same time. A lot depends on the shape of the object. A feather like object made from iron next to a sphere of plastic will take longer. Of course, it depends on the density of the fluid too. An iron feather shape will sink infinitely faster than a sphere of cork if you drop them both in water.\n \n The problem with creationists arguments is that objects of comparable size and density, and of comparable streamlined shapes should have ended in the same stratum. That didn't happen. Ichthyosaurs and other marine reptiles ended up in strata of the same age that contained dinosaurs. On the other hand, dolphins, porpoises, and whales ended up in strata of the same age as the rest of the mammals. Nowhere has there ever been found an Ichthyosaur in the same bed as dolphins or a dolphin in the same bed as Ichthyosaurs.",

It's all about \"differential escape.\"\n \n And oak trees could run faster than pine trees. emoticon_cool",
