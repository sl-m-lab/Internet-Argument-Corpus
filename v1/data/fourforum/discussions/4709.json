   "Are people with solid religious views on abortion, evolution etc looking for a leader that will be more forcefull about these issues? Bush does not like abortion but he is not constantly struggling to make it illegal? Fundamentalists seem to make more of a fuss over gay marriage which seems crazy if they are certain abortion is exactly the same as murder and it is happening all the time. According to their ethics each abortion is just as unacceptable as the shiavo affair so why are they more vocal about Terri Shiavo.",
