   "Scientists decide cold killed Neanderthals \n A new survey of evidence from the ice age has given scientists the most definitive theory to date on the mystery of why the pre-historic Neanderthal people died out.\n It apparently comes down to bad weather.\n Thirty international experts have come together to publish what they say is the most definitive answer yet.\n They believe humans' closest relatives were unequipped to cope with the cold and were eventually driven to extinction.\n The data, based on up-to-date climate models and fossil evidence, show that Neanderthals retreated south as the ice sheets encroached on their territory.\n The first early modern humans migrated south too but the arrival of a more advanced race with superior tools and warm clothing appears to have re-invigorated the human population, stopping our ancestors from suffering the same fate as the Neanderthals.\n -- BBC\n http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/s1029572.htm\n \n I can't find much more on this item, but it would seem rather odd, as all the while people have stated that Neanderthal had evolved/adapted to live in the cold. Does anyone know anymore on this?",

   "I don't think that this is an indication that Neandertals weren't cold adapted. It is clear that they were. They lived in cold climates and they had many characteractics that are indicative of cold adaptation.\n \n \"...Neanderthals simply did not have the technological know-how to survive the increasingly harsh winters.\"\n \n So it isn't a matter of not being adapted to cold, but a matter of it being too cold. Neandertals certainly weren't adapted to equitorial living and were just unlucky to have found themselves next to the glaciers. It just got too cold.\n \n Interesting idea.",
