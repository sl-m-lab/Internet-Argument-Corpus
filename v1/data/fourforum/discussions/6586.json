   "Hello friends,\n I am an engg student doing a project on reactive distillation and want to know an information regarding Acetic acid analysis.\n I am using the system of Acetic acid and Butanol to produce Butyl acetate and water.\n I want to find the conversion of the reaction and now then we are using the Acid number concept to find the conversion.\n Please suggest me whether this method is correct and if not please suggest me some other method to do the analysis of the compounds....of all acetic acid, butanol, butyl acetate.\n We don't have GC in our college and hence i have to go about with Conventional procedures...so please, suggest me a method to analyse this system.\n Awaiting ur reply.\n Regards.",

You are using alot of terms that aren't used in American chemistry classes, like \"Acid number concept\" and \"conversion of the reaction\". Are those like p.H. and equilibrium constants, or maybe reaction rate? Sorry I can't be of more help.",
