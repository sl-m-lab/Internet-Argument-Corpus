   "Secret service spooks are intercepting political rivals at the very beginning of election race. Been there, done that.... in America dating back to 70's. Then Watergate scandal ruined President Nixon's career completely. I guess Ukrainian president Yuschenko is on the same path making the same error. Or maybe not the error actually but the style of dirty political tricks he was taught by American spin doctors.\n There is leakage into mass-media of the bugs planted by Security Service of Ukraine in the headquarters of the opposition Party of Regions and in the office of its leaders, Yanukovich in particular. \n Yuschenko is afraid of open rivalry. This means he lacks political strength. \n It's really discouraging for 'orange revolution' supporters in Europe!\n This is the beginning of the end IMHO.",
