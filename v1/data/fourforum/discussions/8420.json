   "Does anyone know or have any idea at all how big Jesus's Earthly family was? This includes half brothers and sisters. Also, could Joseph have been married before and then became a widower?\n We know that in cording to the Bible, that Joseph refrained from sex with Mary until after Jesus was born. I don't think anything is said about afterwords though.\n \n This question is based on pure curiosity.\n \n If you use scripture, please use it for the topic at hand.\n \n My thoughts: Joseph was much older than Mary. Maybe as much as 30-40 years older. When he was younger (in his teens) he could have married another woman who wound up dying after so many number of years. He could have had children with them.\n The only thing marriage wise the bible says is that Mary was a virgin. Nothing at all is said about Joseph so he could very well have been married before.\n Also, we know that Jesus had at least one brother named James who was credited with writing the book of James.\n Sources:\n Here are some sources that I would prefer be used if sources have to be used.\n 1) Any book of the New Testament of the Bible (preferably any translation than KJV.)\n 2) Any passage from the Old Testament that deals with marriage or family laws. Since Mary and Joseph were raised Jewish, than those would be the laws that they tried to follow.\n 3) Any reference to \"The family of Jesus\" in scholarly works or National Geographical type information either written or televised.\n Please make sure to site them or say something about where the information came from.",

Overlay it with pure gold, both inside and out, and make a gold molding around it.\n\n \n You see how the Ark of the old Covenant was just normal wood, earthenware, just simple but by Gods command the ark of the old covenant is preserved with a layer of PURE GOLD INSIDE AND OUT.\n \n \nThen put in the ark the Testimony, which I will give you. \n\n \n You see how the ark was called into existance and preserved with purity even before God gave moses his eternal word\n \n The testimony they carried in the ark was the eternal word of God writen on tablets of Stone.\n \n Mary the ordinary human being, earthenware Ark of the new covenant carried the word of God in the flesh, Jesus Christ, the testimony God himself.\n \n Just as The ark of the old covenant was called into existance by the word of\n god and preserved from its conception by his command \"Overlay it with pure gold, both inside and out\" so too mary was called into existance by almighty god and preserved both inside and out by the power of his command.\n \n \n \nHow did that \"sacred tradition\" get started. Was it carved into a sacred stone \"Mary and Joseph never got it going on period!\" And then that stone hidden away in a cave somewhere and only passed down orally?\n It's even been suggested that some of the original 12 apostles were blood related brothers of Jesus.\n\n \n actually sacred scripture, or at least the New testiment is product of sacred tradition, tradition is passed down in binding documents of the Catholic Church and goes back to the apostles of christ, sacred tradition got started at the very outset of the church in 33AD and if it were not for sacred tradition we would not have had the sacred scriptures of the new testiment 90-110AD \n \n There was James the brother of Jesus who was one of the twelve but thats because he came from the same clan in nazareth.\n \n \n \nAlso, the idea that Mary was sinless is also unsubstantiated. In fact, she calls God, \"My Savior\" in the Gospels.\n\n \n Mary still needed a saviour - Imagine\n \n Someone digs a giant hole in the garden and every human being who walks in the graden falls into this hole and a woman comes along and Christ stops her from falling into the hole and then he picks out all those who have already fell into the hole and washes them, did the woman not need saving?\n \n \nHowever, the doctrine of the virgin conception of Mary is Biblical.\n\n \n Mary was not concieved without sex that is unbiblical.\n \n \nThe idea that mary remained a perpetual virgin is a sham, unless someone can show us the earliest documentation on that.\n\n \n the idea she had sex is a sham unless someone can show us the earliest documentation on that.\n \n All the reformers belived in the perpetual virginity of Mary its only recently that uneducated protestants have began to object to this doctrine, its just another shining example of how protestantisim Can not Keep its unity",

This is a great mystery, and I mean in reference to Christ and the church...\" Ephesians 5:25, 5:31-32.\n\n \n No forgivness required, your answer is perfect.\n \n sex outside of marriage is in violation to the eucharist\n \n The eucharist is the sacrament of the Church in that it streghens and gives life our relationship with Christ that we entered into through the sacrament of Baptism\n \n Sex or making love in the fullest sense, is a gift from god that strenghens and gives life to a relationship between a man and a woman joined together\n through that covenant oath we call the sacrament of Marriage.\n \n Sex is animalist if it is used for our own purpose our own gratification, sometimes when we do the way it makes us feel clouds our judgement about how we feel about our sexual partner and often we confuse lust with love\n That is because sex is designed in such a way by god so as to sustain, strenghen and give life to a loving relationship, often because we are experiancing the gift of sex without being in love, we think we are in love, that is why the Catholic church teaches against sex before marriage.\n \n \n \n \njust for the record - you're really saying making sex less animalistic is a good thing?\n\n \n Shocking thing to say, radical thinking?\n \n The whole message of christ is shocking and radical because its so different to the way people think today\n \n Yes of course I am saying making sex less animalistc and more divine is a good thing.\n \n Do you think embracing animalistic sex would be a good thing?\n \n i think not, how animalistic do you want it to become, using people as objects of sexual lust, how far do you take that? \n \n rape, pedophillia, homosexual intercourse, orgies, prostitution, one night stands?\n \n Or a total self giving of one man to one woman in a oath with each other and using Gods Gift of sex to sustain, strenghen and Give life to the realtionship and to the whole world?\n \n \n You see animalistic sex brings forth death and destruction, be that through Aids and other STD's or Abortion - it destroys dignity, self respect and love.\n \n But to comit to divine sex brings forth life both emotionally, physically and spiritually and thus builds up your dignity and self respect.",

   "Does anyone know or have any idea at all how big Jesus's Earthly family was? This includes half brothers and sisters. Also, could Joseph have been married before and then became a widower?\n We know that in cording to the Bible, that Joseph refrained from sex with Mary until after Jesus was born. I don't think anything is said about afterwords though.\n \n This question is based on pure curiosity.\n \n If you use scripture, please use it for the topic at hand.\n \n My thoughts: Joseph was much older than Mary. Maybe as much as 30-40 years older. When he was younger (in his teens) he could have married another woman who wound up dying after so many number of years. He could have had children with them.\n The only thing marriage wise the bible says is that Mary was a virgin. Nothing at all is said about Joseph so he could very well have been married before.\n Also, we know that Jesus had at least one brother named James who was credited with writing the book of James.\n Sources:\n Here are some sources that I would prefer be used if sources have to be used.\n 1) Any book of the New Testament of the Bible (preferably any translation than KJV.)\n 2) Any passage from the Old Testament that deals with marriage or family laws. Since Mary and Joseph were raised Jewish, than those would be the laws that they tried to follow.\n 3) Any reference to \"The family of Jesus\" in scholarly works or National Geographical type information either written or televised.\n Please make sure to site them or say something about where the information came from.\n\n James is not Jesus' brother although that term is used. In Genesis 14:12, 16 Lot is referred to as Abram's brother but he is really Abram's brother's son--a nephew. Laban calls Jacob his brother when Jacob is really his nephew in Genesis 29: 10, 15. Brother was used to denote true brothers and also close kin. Keep in mind that there was no word for cousin in Aramaic so brother is also used in this instance.\n \n Read the story of Jesus being \"lost\" and then found in the temple (Luke 2:41-52). It makes no mention of Joseph and Mary having other children when searching for Jesus. It makes no mention of other children being with the travelers. Jesus was 12 years old at that time. 12 years between children does occur sometimes but in an age where fertility was a blessing and there was little contraception I don't believe that time span likely.\n \n Consider that at the end of his life from the cross, Jesus gave his mother to John to be cared for (John 19:26-27). John was now her family. Why would Jesus do that in an intensely family oriented culture if he had other brothers that would be with her?\n \n Also, to get a bit more complicated, if you cross reference Luke 6:15-16, Matthew 10:3 and 27:56 and John 19:25 then it rules out James and Joses as brothers of Jesus although they are mentioned elsewhere as brothers of Jesus.\n \n Catholic teaching does allow that Jesus may have had half-brothers from a previous marriage of Joseph being that many think he was much older than Mary.",

Read this excerpt:\n \n \"His great work, \"De Revolutionibus orblure coelestium\", was published at the earnest solicitation of two distinguished churchmen, Cardinal Sch\u00f6mberg and Tiedemann Giese, Bishop of Culm. It was dedicated by permission to Pope Paul III in order, as Copernicus explained, that it might be thus protected from the attacks which it was sure to encounter on the part of the \"mathematicians\" (i.e. philosophers) for its apparent contradiction of the evidence of our senses, and even of common sense. He added that he made no account of objections which might be brought by ignorant wiseacres on Scriptural grounds. Indeed, for nearly three quarters of a century no such difficulties were raised on the Catholic side, although Luther and Melanchthon condemned the work of Copernicus in unmeasured terms. Neither Paul III, nor any of the nine popes who followed him, nor the Roman Congregations raised any alarm, and, as has been seen, and, as has been seen, Galileo himself in 1597, speaking of the risks he might run by an advocacy of Copernicanism, mentioned ridicule only and said nothing of persecution.\"\n (emphasis mine) Here's the article:http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04352b.htm\n \n Copernicus encountered opposition from Protestant biblicists. Why did the Church not persecute Copernicus as they supposedly did Galileo if they had such a hostility to science and felt threatened? Some say it was because Copernicus did not himself proclaim his ideas as dogma before they were proven. Galileo did, however, when there was still much to learn and prove. Galileo had a hostile relationship with the Church but it wasn't all the Church's fault. And Galileo had errors in his work.\n \n Lastly, I still believe heaven can be up and hell can be down.",

Is one as good as the other? If you had to choose which would be your choice?\n\n \n Ah, now you seek to broaden your argument and compare the two by quality. As you may have gathered, I adopt a sociobiological approach to religion and culture in general, viewing cultural institutions as part of a society's adaptation to their ecological and economic circumstances. In this view, your rhetorical questions about whether one or the other has shown us a trustworthy face of god etc are secondary to a much more fundamental question: did it work for that society in those circumstances? I very much doubt that an Abrahamic-style monotheism would have been as functional for the Maya as the religion they had.",

A quick Google reveals\n \n \nThe devout Roman Catholic said that the plot of Apocalypto - a Greek word meaning 'new beginning' - concerns a Maya Indian family man who 'has to overcome tremendous odds to preserve what he values the most'.

Much depends on interpretation and that is down to individuals.\n \n ALL Churches have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo that they and they alone are right in their interpretations but will allow carefully controlled investigations.
