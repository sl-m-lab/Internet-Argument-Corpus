To turn a bone into a fossil, it has to be buried fast and put under pressure, or esle it will rot.\n\n Not necessarily. It depends on a lot of conditions. If an organism falls in an anoxic environment, it may be fossilized. Sometimes they are buried quickly. Sometimes not. For example, the bottom of the Solnhofen lagoon about 140 to 170 million years ago was anoxic. Today, the bottom of the Black Sea is anoxic.\n \n You don't explain why a bone has to be under pressure. I thought it was mineralization that made the fossil.\n \n And so what?

   "Some of you put your credibility on the line by saying that the Sun isn't shrinking. I did some research in this area, and came up with some interesting results. It seems that the Sun IS shrinking... however much the evolutionists don't want it to. http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/2760.asp has an interesting article. It is long.\n \n \"...And what of Stephenson's shrinkage rate of 0.16 second of arc per century? The Skeptic author says the error in this figure is about 0.14 second of arc per century 'so that there is no solid evidence of shrinkage' and 'this agrees with Gilliland's conclusion'. While he is correctly reporting Stephenson's shrinkage result of 0.16\u00b1 0.14 second of arc per century, it is wrong for both the Skeptic author and Stephenson to say that there is no solid evidence of shrinkage or that this is 'essentially a null result' (Stephenson, p. 151). Such statements are misleading at best and dishonest at worst. The calculated shrinkage rate of 0.16\u00b1 0.14 second of arc per century is not no shrinkage, but says that there is shrinkage at a rate of somewhere between 0.02 and 0.30 second of arc per century.\n \n .... Gilliland did have solid evidence of shrinkage and concluded the above small rate of almost 0.2 second of arc per century, very close to Stephenson's 0.16 and within the 0.02-0.30 range that is the correct Stephenson result, Stephenson's misleading reporting notwithstanding.\n \n So how does the Skeptic author answer his own question: 'Is the sun shrinking?' He says:\n \n 'To answer the question posed in the title of this section-the sun oscillates up and down in size, but there is very little evidence of steady shrinkage.'\n \n Note that the 'no solid evidence of shrinkage' at the end of his previous paragraph has become 'there is very little evidence of shrinkage'. Of course he's wrong since both authors whose work he has drawn from (i.e. Gilliland and Stephenson) agree that there is evidence of a shrinkage rate of around 0.16-0.20 second of arc per century within the range of 0.02-0.30 second of arc per century to account for the error margins. Indeed, as we have repeatedly seen, Gilliland is adamant that 'one is inexorably led to the conclusion that a negative secular solar radius trend has existed since AD 1700.'\n \n How dare the Skeptic author conclude with the comment that 'any creationist arguments based on such shrinkage should be treated with caution indeed' when in the space of less than one page he, the Skeptic author, has repeatedly and blatantly misrepresented other scientists' conclusions and made glaring errors in order to attempt a refutation of creationist arguments.\n \n We have every reason in fact to be skeptical about the Skeptics and their attempts at answering the powerful creationist arguments if this is the level of their use and abuse of science, other scientists' work, and the ethics of writing. Unsuspecting readers should be clearly warned not to be fooled.\n \n But why should the Skeptic author want the answer to his question to be that there is no shrinkage of the sun and no solid, or little, evidence of steady shrinkage?\n \n Because even if we take Stephenson's bottom-of-the-range figure of a mere 0.02 second of arc per century (tiny shrinkage indeed), this means that, using the evolutionists' own uniformitarian assumption of extrapolating this shrinkage rate backwards in time, just as they extrapolate further back 10-15 billion years to the 'big bang', only 100 million years ago the sun would have been too large for life to exist on earth!\n \n But this won't do for the Skeptic author who, like other evolutionists, believes life has been on this earth for at least three billion years, so the sun must not be shrinking. Notice that his conclusion is not based on the evidence, since we have just seen that the solid evidence does support a small shrinkage rate, but on his a priori commitment to evolution, that is, his starting belief in evolution before he even looked at the evidence. Yes, we should be skeptical about the Skeptics and their arguments.\"",

   "Freeofthought stated:\n \nEarth's turn is also slowing down and the calculations backwards on that also create a few problems.\n\n Karl asked him to calculate the length of a day 1 billion years ago. It seems that he needs some help.\n \n A geologist came up with the following numbers from a survey of geology and astronomy texts. Most of these numbers are derived from daily growth rings in coral (bet Freeofthought didn't know there was such a thing) and similar information from brachiopods, bryozoans and pelecypods, and the like. \n \nGeologic time/millions of years ago (mybp)/days per year \n late Precambrian/900mybp/487 days \n earliest Cambrian Period/600mybp/424 days \n early Ordovician Period/500mybp/412 days \n middle Devonian Period/370mybp/398 days \n Permo-Triassic boundary/245mybp/386 days \n \"Jurassic Park\"/180mybp/381 days \n end Cretaceous (Chixulub)/65mybp/371 days\n\n But that doesn't help much with calculating the length of a day from actual astronomical observations. Perhaps if we told Freeofthought that the current rate of slowing of the earth is 0.005 sec/year/year. I have no doubt that Freeofthought will misunderstand that number - it is a rate. Just assume that rate has been unchanging even though it hasn't been.\n \n A lot of the creationists misunderstanding comes from remarks like the following.\n \nFrom time to time our timekeepers must adjust their super accurate atomic clocks to synchronize them with the Earth's slowing rotation whose day/night cycles we base our lives on.\n\n Actually, that's not true. The standard upon which the \"super accurate atomic clocks\" are based is slightly different from the actual rotation of the earth. It is as if you had two clocks that kept time slightly differently. I have to adjust the time on my grandfather clock all the time - every time I raise the weights I reset it to the correct time. It used to keep pretty good time and require resetting only about every six months but it broke and I had to replace the works. It has taken a good six months to adjust the speed to the point that it is now off by only about a minute/week. I'm still adjusting.\n \n That's what is happening with the \"leap seconds\" that occur from time to time. The adjustment is primarily to sync up two clocks keeping slightly different times, one of which is very accurate, the other of which varies and is slowing at the rate of 0.005 sec/year/year.",

And if you had read carefully you would have noticed that Karl told you when. He specifically said \"over 200 years ago\". You see, the clergy had lots of free time during the week to pursue scientific investigations. That they did it with the intent of revealing the glory of God doesn't change the fact that they concluded that the story of the flood as depicted in the Bible was not true.\n \n It is, in fact, true that many respected scientists of the 1700s and 1800 were trained in divinity, just as Darwin was.",

And of course, the KKK and the Aryan Brotherhood make the same claims as you. Of course, you're going to tell me that you are a christian and they aren't.

   "Creationism for Benjie\n \n As Karl has already pointed out, when he mentioned a die hard creationist site, you took offense with a response about christians. It seems that creationists of all sorts believe that they are the only true christians, eliminating all of the mainline Christian sects, as well as some of the minor ones.\n \n Why are creationists so ignorant? My opinion is that they intentionally cut themselves off from knowledge of reality. They turn inward with others of their ilk and cultivate the idea that they know the truth and have no need to examine science, history or philosophy. They are proud of their ignorance.\n \n So here is a list of the types of creationists, modified from one by Dr. Eugenie Scott of the National Center for Science Education.\n \n The creation v. evolution controversy is not as most die hard creationists would have you believe. It is not a dichotomy with the creationist/christians on one side and the evolutionist/atheists on the other. There is actually a continuum of belief/opinion - from pure baseless faith to acceptance of observations of reality. So here is the creation/evolution continuum.\n \n Flat Earthers - Yep. There still are some. There aren't many, but there is a Flat Earth Society. These people base their belief on a literal reading of the Bible. They do less interpreting than others who claim a literal reading of the Bible. Flat earthers believe that the earth is flat and circular. After all, the Bible refers to the \"circle of earth.\" At least these people realize that a circle is not a sphere.\n \n Geocentrists - While geocentrists hold the views of flat earthers in most other beliefs (a dome [firmament] above holding up water with the sun, moon and stars attached to or fixed in it), their \"literal\" interpretation of the Bible is that the earth is a sphere (the \"circle\" of earth again) at the center of the universe. Everything revolves around a fixed and imovable earth. They take 1 Chron 30 to mean what it says, \"the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.\" Geocentrists are also a small minority of creationists, but they are more numerous than flat earthers. I know one and there is the Official Geocentricity Website of Dr. Gerardus D. Bouw. Another geocentric web site is Geocentricism and Heliocentricism which pretends that geocentricism is supported by the evidence as much as heliocentricism.\n \n Young Earth Creationism - Like the flat earthers and the geocentrists, the young earth creationists (YEC) base their belief on their version of a literal Bible. They believe that the universe and earth is only 6,000 to 10,000 years old. A major element of this belief is based on the flood geology of the 7th Day Adventist, George McReady Price. The modernization of the science curriculum in U.S. schools after the launching of Sputnik prompted creationists such as John Morris to develop flood geology and YEC. Scientific evidence is either twisted or ignored in order to make it fit into the YEC belief. Henry Morris, Ken Ham, Kent Hovind, Carl Baugh, and Walt Brown and their associates are all YECs.\n \n Old Earth Creationism - Old earthers recognize the scientific evidence for an old earth. This first came about in the 1700's and was a well established idea in the major churches from about the mid 1800's. Old earthers accept the scientific view of the origins of the universe, earth and living things as investigations into God's method of creation.\n \n Gap Creationists - Gap creationists envision a gap between Genesis I:1 and Genesis I:2. This allows a long history for earth with several previous creations that created the geologic record. The Bible depicts the last of these creations.\n \n Day-Age Creationists - Also an attempt to accomodate a literal reading of the Bible. Day-agers believe that the 6 days of creation are vast ages that allows a reconciliation of the Bible with observed facts. Some even see a parallel between organic evolution and Genesis.\n \n Progressive Creationists - PC views creation as an on-going project. God created the \"kinds\" successively, replacing some of them from time to time with other \"kinds.\"\n \n Intelligent Design Creationists - First argued by William Paley in 1803, ID has again become popular. ID proponents claim that some features of living organisms are to complex to have evolved without the work of an intelligent designer. ID creationists usually claim that the designer is unknown but they are christians with only a few exceptions. There are ID creationists actually fit into most of the versions of creationism, from young earth to theistic evolutionist.\n \n Evolutionary Creationism - EC is the belief that God uses evolution to bring about his plan. God is the Creator and evolution is His means of creation.\n \n Theistic Evolution - Very little difference from here to the previous type. Theistic evolutionists still see God as the Creater and Prime Mover, but He takes less of an active role in developments. God created and nature proceeds according to His plan without need for tinkering.\n \n Materialist Evolutionism - In this view, religious considerations have been removed. All three of the last of these can be methodological materialists. All three of the last can do science. This last type is also a philosophical naturalist.\n \n Creationists tend to be christians because creationism is based on a more or less literal reading of the Bible. But even Jewish creationists are rare. They seem to view their scripture quite differently from the way that christians do. Moreover, the stricter versions of creationism tend to be found in the U.S. Even in Christian countries, creationism is not a force.\n \n So there you go, Benjie. While creationists do tend to be christians overwhelmingly, the two terms are not interchangable. In fact, most Christians are either evolutionary creationists or theistic evolutionists. They see no need to reject reality in order to support a literal reading of the mythology of nomadic, bronze age herdsmen.",

   "Today, almost half a century after the publication of the encyclical (Humani Generis), new knowledge has led to the recognition of the theory of evolution as more than a hypothesis.

It is indeed remarkable that this theory has been progressively accepted by researchers, following a series of discoveries in various fields of knowledge. The convergence, neither sought nor fabricated, of the results of work that was conducted independently is in itself a significant argument in favor of this theory.\n\n The statement was made in an address to the Pontifical Acacemy of Sciences in 1996. It is clear that the Pope considers the theory of evolution to be valid. However, this is not a an encyclical and not a statement ex cathedra. Therefore it is not a statement of doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church. However, he is stating that, recognizing a restriction, the theory of evolution does not contradict Christian faith. He reaffirmed the statement made by Pius XII of that restriction. They is, \"If the human body take its origin from pre-existent living matter, the spiritual soul is immediately created by God.\"\n \n So yes.

   "Way back when I took embryology, the professor wrote on the board the first day of class, \"Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\" He then turned to the class and pointed to the words and said, \"That is wrong. If any time during the progress of this course you begin to think that it may be correct, you are in danger of failing this course. You must see me immediately so that we can discuss the matter and you can correct your error.\" We then went on with a course in embryology.\n \n Actually, I don't know why the drawings were used in books long after it was known that they were wrong. Even Haeckel's contemporaries noticed that the drawings weren't correct and got him to admit it. I didn't think that they were actually used that much any more, at least not without comment. At least that was my experience. Perhaps I just had a better teacher than most. They became somewhat of a standard and probably were put in to the books because publishers were too lazy to change them. Maybe they didn't know any better. Shortly after Haeckel admited what he had done, Romanes used them in a book in 1901. I don't know if he was aware that the drawings were fudged, but they seem to have been picked up by text after text after that. Certainly, most examples I have seen in recent years do not represent Haeckel's drawings as correct. Why did Haeckel fudge the pictures? Maybe he thought he was on to something with his biogenetic law. Fudging the data can destroy a career today (unless you are a creation scientist).\n \n Richardson's paper in 1997 caused a stir. He told everyone what they should have already known, that Haeckel fudged the drawings. It is too bad that it wasn't made clearer that the drawings were wrong much earlier. I even found a page from a small college that claims that Richardson's paper corrected a major misunderstanding among developmental biologists and evolutionary biologists. I don't know that that is true. I don't recall ever hearing from any qualified biologist that wasn't aware of the fact that the pictures are wrong and the biogenetic law is wrong.\n \n In reality, the adult features of ancestors seldom appear as intermediate stages in the ontogeny of a descendant. What is closer to being true is that different descendants of a common ancestor are likely to share early embryonic characters with one another and, one presumes, with the common ancestor. However, various features develop at different rates in the descendants than they did in the ancestor. Thus, a coordinated appearance of the ancestral morphology is unlikely to be seen in the descendant.\n \n Also, preadult stages of an organism must grow and survive in their own environment. Therefore they may show characteristics that the ancestor didn't have, or they may not develop characteristics that would be a detriment.\n \n There is also the observation that in some cases it is a juvenile characteristic of the ancestor that appears in the descendant rather than an adult characteristic of the ancestor appearing in the juvenal. Just that is enough to falsify the biogenetic law.\n \n But I can tell you quite simply why your book says, \"The data show that there really are similarities in embryonic structures, supporting the concept of common ancestry.\" It is because the data show that there really are similarities in embryonic structures, supporting the concept of common ancestry.",

No one has seen it orbit the sun yet. How did they know that it would actually come closer to the sun than Neptune in 1979 and move forther away again in 1999? They told me that when I was young. But no one had ever seen it. It was just speculation - a scientific theory, right?? \n ;) :p",

Due to the laws of gravity, planets go in regular circular or elliptical paths. By observing a planet for a period of time and making measurements, you can find out mathematically how that planet moves, how long it takes to complete one orbit, where that orbit lies, how fast it moves e.t.c.",
