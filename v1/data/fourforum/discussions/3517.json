He was credited with five years, four months and five days of service toward his six-year service obligation.\n\n \n Ok, I phrased the question badly. Kerry also recieved an Honorable Discharge, so it's not a matter of whether he did, but a matter of whether he should have. \n \n The question is about the disputed service.

I believe you are using the same twisted logic as you did when you claimed that because I approved of one person breaking one law and disapproved of another person breaking a different law I held a double standard, basing your argument on the fact that the two people may have had the same underlying sentiment...that they disagreed with the particular law.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n You are one of them.\nYou missed the point.
