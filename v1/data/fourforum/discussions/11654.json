You think that therefore Wall Street may be perhaps just slightly to blame?\n\n \n I don't believe that the clip said that Wall Street was blameless. But it does show whom the lion&#8217;s share of the blame is attributed to. And those people are trying to shift the blame to those who warned congress about it and tried to fix the problem but were blocked by those who benefited and caused it.\n \n \nIf people hadn't taken out mortgages they couldn't afford or - even if they could have afforded them at the time - on overpriced homes, perhaps this might not have happened.\n\n \n In the clip I posted shows how the price of homes became inflated. They became inflated because the regs for loans were relaxed by individuals in the government allowing people who had no business getting a loan to qualify for them. This flooded the market with buyers with a limited number of homes for sale, which caused the price of homes to spike. This is simple economics. \n \n \nAnd furthermore - a little detail which might escape some of you - the vast majority of the mortgages in trouble and which caused the problem are second mortgages, which were not usually \"compelled\" by lenders through government intervention.\n\n \n I could probably agree with you on this point but there is no source to back up your claim. With some sort of documentation would help substantiate your claim. \n \n \n \n \nHere's a less partisan account, from last year!\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC31Oudc5Bg&feature=related\n\n \n I don't know how you can even with a clear conscience compare the two clips. With one you have actual documentation with time line which anyone can see isn't partisan at all it is an accounting of the facts, the other is of two individuals discussing one of the persons opinion and making jokes of the crisis, which would more likely to be the partisan clip if either of them were? I fail to see how anyone could even entertain the thought that the clip I posted could in anyway be partisan since it has the documentation to back up it's claim, where yours is the opinion of one person.",

You think that therefore Wall Street may be perhaps just slightly to blame? \n\n \n The word \"slightly\" is an excellent word, yes. :)\n \n \nIf people hadn't taken out mortgages they couldn't afford or - even if they could have afforded them at the time - on overpriced homes, perhaps this might not have happened. \n\n \n That's true of course. People living beyond their means seems to be an increasing problem. Isn't 30% of total income considered enough for a house payment? I've heard loans are being taken out for almost 50% - that's just nuts, especially if it's a dual income. Different people have different capabilities for making big purchases and then living simply to afford them, but there are guidelines and statistics, and it should be the responsibility of the person behind the desk talking directly to the loan applicant to provide that information, then make the right decision, and share in paying the price if it's the wrong decision. \n \n \nAnd furthermore - a little detail which might escape some of you - the vast majority of the mortgages in trouble and which caused the problem are second mortgages, which were not usually \"compelled\" by lenders through government intervention.\n\n \n If the government compells first mortgages, maybe it could do more to discourage second mortgages in those cases. But the fact remains that blame for loan defaults rests with one party - the one responsible for paying the loan. Bankruptcy and other legal games come too easy these days, IMO.",
