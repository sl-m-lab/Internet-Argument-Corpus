   "Ok....many of you evolutionists have been tricked into believing that mutations arise randomly....that genes are not effected by the enviornment...that they cannot be flipped on and off to form new traits. etc.\n \n However, it seems that a large number of people in our society are coming down with Depression and lots of other assorted 'diseases.\" And it's now coming out that supposedly a mutation is causing this phenomenon.\n \n http://www.webmd.com/content/article/98/104740.htm\n \n So my question is....how has Depression infiltrated society so quickly? I mean for an accidental mutation to take place and then spread throughout 250 million people, it would logically take hundreds of thousands of years.\n \n Not to mention that virtually all members of today's society are able to breed, and those who don't breed fail to do so because of choice or a lack of luck with the opposite sex -- not because of some genetic problem.\n \n So how exactly is this Depression mutation \"beneficial?\" Evolutionists say that only the beneficial mutations will spread out over the population. So what's up with your theory? Nature seems to be contradicting it left and right. Mutations are spreading like wildfire across our society. How does this happen???? Are only the depressed breeding? Why would the opposite sex only be attracted to those who are depressed? What kind of weird fetish is that???? \n \n But in reality....since most every person in society is, in fact, able to breed, wouldn't it make sense that evolutionary change would have to come to a halt in humans? I mean, since most everyone can breed, wouldn't any mutations that happened get quickly watered down and eliminated?\n \n Also it seems that instead of the beneficial traits spreading out across a population, it's the CRUMMY/destructive traits that seem to be doing that. What's up with that?\n \n Finally....would you say that the Anger/Road Rage gene accidentally mutated and spread out across the population the same way? How would Anger or Road Rage be an advantageous trait? Is that some sort of strange survival trait where if one doesn't flip somebody off or get out of his car to start a fight that he will somehow be better able to breed??? emoticon_confused \n \n http://preventdisease.com/news/artic...reditary.shtml\n \n And there's evidently a \"drug abuse\" gene that has magically made its way through society......are only drug addicts/angry/road rage/depressed/kook-psychotic people breeding? MY GOSH! emoticon_wow \n \n \n And just when you think evolutionary theory can't get any weirder -- these genius evolutionist scientists come along and try to tell us that Depression is a BENEFICIAL trait!! Do they think we're that dumb? I guess so!!!\n \n -------------------------------\n \"In Dr. Randolph Nesse and George C. Williams, PhD's book, \"Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine,\" they consider depression to be helpful for several reasons. Sadness will change one's behavior, thereby stopping the current harmful activity or prevent future harmful activities. We can behave differently after a loss so then our future looks more positive in three steps. First, stop what you are doing; so then the damaging action is then stopped. Secondly, set aside the common human tendency of optimism. Studies have found that most people often overestimate their effectiveness and abilities. Finally, we can take off the \"rose-colored glasses.\" Once this is done, then we can reasses our goals and strategies more objectively\" (Nesse and Williams, 1999).\n \n (oh my gosh!) :xbanghead \n \n \n \"These authors believe that \"low mood\" keeps us from jumping abruptly to escape momentary difficulties. As difficulties increase and energy is wasted, depression helps separate us from hopeless situations, so then we can consider alternatives. The capacity for high and low mood is a mechanism for adjusting the assigning of resources as a function of favoring current depression on the opportunities. If there is little hope for a rewarding payoff, it is best to just sit and wait rather than waste energy\" (1999). \n \n \"Dr. Nesse, a director of the Evolution and Human Adaptation program at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social research, has done some studies and has synthesized some arguments of his own. He maintains that some forms of depression result from genetics and brain abnormality. He also believes, however, that other cases may have their foundation in evolutionary history (Goode, 2000). Depression developed as a defense mechanism, a useful response to a situation in which a desired goal is unattainable. Depression may help a person disengage from what proves to be a hopeless effort. It is worthwhile to be depressed. Depression has low costs, when compared with its potential for protection. Nesse's theories draw from Dr. Eric Klinger, a psychologist from the University of Minnesota, whose studies have shown that depression plays an important role in the process of separating from a goal or situation. The fact that depression sets in after someone suffers failure or a loss is significant. It slows you down, helps you to take a step back, consider the situation and approaches differently\" (Goode, 2000). \n \n http://preventdisease.com/news/artic...reditary.shtml\n ----------------------------------------\n \n You've got to be Kidding me!!! What is up with these people? Are they for real? emoticon_xdonno \n \n But it's so true in life: once you tell a lie -- you really have no choice but to keep stacking more lies on top of it to cover it up.\n \n And see, evolutionists have indeed trapped themselves with an original scientific untruth....and over the years, this basic untruth has cascaded into a whole mountain of lies to cover up the original untruth. So what's the original scientific untruth?...it's the notion that the only way beneficial traits can spread throughout the population is via an accidental mutation and subsequent sexual reproduction. \n \n Usually evolutionists are pretty good about covering up lies with other lies that make the first lie seem plausible to the unsuspecting. They have perfected this art. But now it has all caught up to them. \n \n \n Just when you think evolutionary theory can't get any weirder -- these genius evolutionist scientists come along and try to tell us that Depression is a beneficial trait! This is a pefect example of how one simple lie can get you deeper and deeper into a pit of more and more ridiculous, unending string of lies.\n \n But see at this point, they have no option...because if they admitted that Depression emerges from within each individual, they'd be exposing the initial lie on which their whole platform was based. \n \n In this case, I guess these scientists are hoping that everyone in society is as stupid as they think they are. why are scientists too chicken to admit that genes are effected by the environment??? emoticon_xchicken",

The problem is that the proportionate contribution of genes and environment in an individual human on a particular trait varies from person to person. Additionally, since one can not rewind the developmental arc of an individual and expose them to various environments to get a sense of how powerful genetic and non-genetic inputs might be in determining their particular phenotype it is rather difficult to assert that individual A's phenotype B was determined by quanta of x genes and y environment (and unlike the environment, at least genes are discrete elements).\n \n Rather, we generally speak of, heritability, which is roughly the phenotypic variation attributable to genotypic variation within a population. Heritability is further divided into \"broad sense\" (additive + dominance effects) and \"narrow sense\" (additive) flavors.1 But the story doesn't end there as those who are skeptical of claims of heritability would remind you, there are gene-environment interactions (or correlation) as well as epistatic effects (the influence that loci have upon each other, adding a nonadditive factor in the equation). So, the final phenotypic variation in a population can be modeled like so....\n \n\n \n As for depression, the depression itself is not the benefit. You are building a strawman arguement there (Not that you know what a strawman arguement is). However, the vulerablity to depression might be linked to a trait that is otherwise a survival characteristic.\n \n However, I suspect that what you see is not that depression is filtrating our society all of a sudden, but rather is it a condition that is now acknowledged. \n It always was there, but it was 'hushed' up and ignored.

How does natural selection act on anything but small, unguided, continuous mutations?\n \n quotes by Gould:\n \n The Requirements for Variation \n \n In order to act as raw material only, variation must walk a tightrope between two unacceptable alternatives. first and foremost, variation must exist in sufficient amounts, for natural selection can make nothing, and must rely upon bounty thus provided; but variation must not be too florid or showy either, lest it become the creative agent of change itself. Variation, in short, must be copious, small in extent, and undirected. A full taxonomy of non-Darwinian evolutionary theories may be elaborated by their denials of one or more of these central assumptions. (Gould 2002: 141) \n \n Darwin's scenario for selective modification always includes the postulate, usually stated explicitly, that all structures vary, and therefore evolve.... If these universally recognized distinctions arise as consequences of differences in the intrinsic capacity of species to vary, then Darwin's key postulate of copiousness would be compromised -- for failure of sufficient raw material would then be setting a primary limit upon the rate and style of evolutionary change, and selection would not occupy the driver's seat. (Gould 2002: 141-142)\n \n SMALL IN EXTENT. If the variations that yielded evolutionary change were large -- producing new major features, or even new taxa in a single step then natural selection would not disappear as an evolutionary force. \n Selection would still function in an auxiliary and negative role as headsman -- to heap up the hecatomb of the unfit, permit new saltation to spread among organisms in subsequent generations, and eventually to take over the population. But Darwinism, as a theory of evolutionary change, would perish -- for selection would become both subsidiary and negative, and variation itself would emerge as the primary, and truly creative, force of evolution, the source of occasionally lucky saltation. For this reason, the quite properly, saltationist (or macromutational) theories have always been viewed as anti-Darwinian -- despite the protestations of de Vries ..., who tried to retain the Darwinian label for his continued support of selection as a negative force. The unthinking, knee-jerk response of many orthodox Darwinians whenever they hear the word \"rapid\" or the name \"Goldschmidt,\" testifies to the conceptual power of saltation as a cardinal danger to an entire theoretical edifice.

   "-----------------------\n \n http://www.natureinstitute.org/pub/ic/ic12/genes.htm\n \n Genes Are Not Immune to Context\n Examples from Bacteria\n Craig Holdrege \n \n \n One of the most widespread misconceptions concerning the nature of genes is that they have a defined and fixed function that allows them to operate the same in all organisms and environments. We have the picture of the robust gene determining all the characteristics an organism has. And this gene will do the same thing in a bacterium as in a corn plant or human being. It doesn't care where it is. The gene carries its set of instructions with it wherever it goes and strictly carries out its duty. \n \n This picture informs genetic engineering. Take a gene from bacteria and put it into a plant and the plant will produce its own pesticide or become resistant to a herbicide. Since such transgenic plants exist, the proof is evidently in the pudding. Genetic manipulation works; genes are faithful workhorses. But does genetic manipulation work the way we imagine with our schematic pictures? What else may be occurring that doesn't fit into a neat mechanistic scheme? \n \n \n The Interactive Gene \n \n With the widespread use of antibiotics in our culture, many bacteria have become resistant. They thrive even when subjected to high doses of antibiotics. As a rule, the resistance comes at a cost, since the resistant bacteria tend to grow slowly. But when they are grown in laboratory cultures, some of these resistant bacteria will experience so-called compensatory mutations-they stay resistant, but change genetically in a way that allows them to grow fast like wild, nonresistant strains. Others mutate back to the wild form and lose their resistance altogether. \n \n The question arises whether such mutations (changes in genes or in higher-order genetic structures) are in any way dependent on the environment. The traditional view, rooted deeply in the Neodarwinian theory of evolution, holds that genes mutate spontaneously and independently of the environment. The classical experiment with bacteria by Luria and Delbr\u00fcck in the 1940s gave clear evidence that such spontaneous, milieu independent mutations exist (Luria and Delbr\u00fcck 1943). For decades this experiment (along with other evidence) served as the rock solid \"proof\" that genetic mutations, except for extreme cases involving irradiation or exposure to chemical toxins, are not influenced by their environment. But more recent research shows that mutations do in fact arise in response to changing environmental conditions. \n \n A group of biologists in Sweden investigated whether the above-mentioned compensatory mutations and the reversion to the wild form in bacteria are influenced by the environment (Bj\u00f6rkman et al. 2000). They grew antibiotic-resistant bacteria-in the absence of antibiotics-as laboratory cultures (in petri dishes) and also inoculated mice with the same bacteria. The researchers monitored the mutations that occurred in the bacteria in these two different habitats. They found that compensatory mutations occurred in both habitats, but, to their surprise, they discovered that the way the genetic material changed differed significantly depending upon the environment. In the case of streptomycin-resistant bacteria in mice, they found ten cases of identical compensatory mutations within the resistance gene. In contrast, this gene never mutated in the lab-cultured bacteria, where they found fourteen compensatory mutations in genes outside the resistance gene. Evidently, the environment had everything to do with what kind of mutations occurred. \"Mice are not furry petri dishes,\" as the title of a commentary article put it (Bull and Levin 2000). \n \n The authors conclude that the mutations are \"condition-dependent\" and suggest that some unknown \"mutational mechanism\" limited the mutations in the mice to a specific part of the resistance gene while also increasing its mutation rate. Whatever the details of cell physiology turn out to be, it is clear that the genome of the bacteria changes in relation to a specific kind of environment. The bacteria-down into their genes-interact with and evolve in relation to their environment.\n \n Adaptive Mutations \n \n In another recent study (Bjedov et al. 2003), a research group in France gathered wild strains of the bacterium E. coli from a wide variety of environments-the large intestines of humans and different animals, soil, air, and water. In the end they collected 787 different strains. These strains were given optimal conditions in lab cultures and began to grow and multiply rapidly, mimicking ideal conditions in nature where bacteria reproduce quickly. But in nature, bacteria are also exposed to times of dearth, where the substrate they live upon, for example, is suddenly used up. To mimic these conditions, the researchers withheld nutrients for a seven-day period. Most bacteria survive under these conditions, but they no longer grow and divide. \n \n The scientists measured the rate of mutations occurring in the cultures the first day after withholding nutrients and then again at the end of the seven-day period. During this time the mutation rate increased on average sevenfold. In other words, the mutation rate increased dramatically when the bacteria no longer received adequate nutrition. The bacteria switch, in the words of the authors, \"between high and low mutation rates depending on environmental conditions\" (p. 1409). \n \n Such a stress-induced increase in mutation rate has been discovered in many laboratory strains of bacteria. Does this increase in mutation rate serve the bacteria, or is it a kind of last gasp, a dissolution of the bacteria before they die of starvation? The answer is clear: the bacteria produce unique kinds of mutations during such periods of physiological stress, some of which help the bacteria survive under specifically those conditions. One speaks of \"adaptive mutations.\" (See Wirz 1998 and Rosenberg 2001 for good overviews of the research and literature.) \n \n For example, there are strains of E. coli that have lost the capacity to utilize the sugar lactose as a source of energy. If such a strain is cultured in a starvation medium with lactose as the only energy source, most of the bacteria remain in a stationary phase until they die. But under these conditions some of the bacteria begin to hypermutate, which means they rapidly create a large number of mutations and among these are ones that allow them to live from lactose. The bacteria with this ability survive, multiply and form new colonies. In at least some cases such adaptive mutations arise only in the specific medium-that is, the mutations allowing bacteria to utilize lactose don't occur when bacteria are grown in a medium with sugars other than lactose. \n \n In other instances, E. coli bacteria do not hypermutate, but find another way to deal with the environmental challenge. Some of the bacteria in the medium with lactose produce multiple copies of the gene related to their inability to live from lactose. This gene amplification seems at first absurd. But scientists found that E. coli strains unable to grow when they only receive lactose as a nutrient do form enzymes that break down lactose, but in inadequate amounts. When the bacteria amplify the defective lactose enzyme gene, the cumulative effect is that they produce enough enzymes to break down a sufficient amount of lactose to grow slowly and survive - a remarkably active and meaningful genetic adaptation. This amplification occurs in no other genes in the bacteria. It is specific to the lactose enzyme gene and clearly induced by the environment.\n \n Transfer of Resistance \n Bacteria have a further way of adapting to new conditions. I have already mentioned antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Cholera bacteria, for example, are normally susceptible to different antibiotics. After 1993 antibiotic-resistant cholera bacteria rapidly spread around the globe. How could this occur? Scientists discovered that these bacteria are simultaneously resistant to at least five different antibiotics. They found that the genes related to this resistance were all grouped together and formed a \"packet\" of genes that can move from bacterium to bacterium. \n \n A research group at Tufts University in Boston recently discovered conditions that facilitate this movement and uptake of genes (Beaber et al. 2004). When bacteria are grown in cultures with concentrations of antibiotics that are not sufficient to kill them, they go through physiological changes similar to what happens to bacteria in a starvation medium. Part of this transformation is called an SOS response. It comes about when DNA is damaged and involves DNA repair and duplication. The Tufts scientists found that during the SOS response the bacteria also increased the transfer of the resistance gene clusters to other bacteria. Evidently, the use of antibiotics promotes the spread of antibiotic resistance among bacteria. In this way, once resistance is anchored in mobile genetic elements, it can spread rapidly. \n \n The examples I have described show how strongly the en-vironment influences the activity of genes, induces changes within genetic structures (mutations), and stimulates the movement of genes between bacteria. Bacteria are in continual interplay with their environment, actively responding to changing conditions. And this responsiveness and flexibility includes genes. If we release genetically engineered bacteria into the environment, there is little doubt that in time they will be passing their genes to other bacteria, as well as receiving genes from other bacteria and mutating according to changing circumstances. Whether the manipulated foreign genes they carry will be exchanged, or how they may affect or be affected by the dynamics of genetic responses to changing environments is completely open. But two things we can know for sure: these genes will not function immune to the changing circumstances and things will happen that no one expects or can foresee. I'm not saying this to promote fear, but to dissolve the illusion that we can keep under control what we have released into the world in this way. Genes are robust, but they are also part of the world.",

   "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution\n \n Evolutionary changes are the product of evolutionary forces acting on genetic variation. In natural populations, there is a certain amount of phenotypic variation (e.g., what makes you appear different from your neighbor). This phenotypic variation is the result of variants in gene sequences among the individuals of a population. There may be one or more functional variants of a gene or locus, and these variants are called alleles. Most sites in the genome (i.e., complete DNA sequence) of a species are identical in all individuals in the population; sites with more than one allele are called polymorphic or segregating sites.\n \n All genetic variation begins as a new mutation in a single individual; in subsequent generations the frequency of that variant may fluctuate in the population, becoming more or less prevalent relative to other alleles at the site. This change in allele frequency is the commonly accepted definition of evolution, and all evolutionary forces act by driving allele frequency in one direction or another. Variation disappears when it reaches the point of fixation - when it either reaches a frequency of zero and disappears from the population, or reaches a frequency of one and replaces the ancestral allele entirely.",

   "...now prove me wrong...\n\n Been there, done that. Here's another simple bit that exposes the error in your thinking:\n Post-partem depression. Caused by a mutation (or even a SNP)? Does the mother's DNA change after the baby is born, then change back after more time has elapsed?\n \n Of course not. It is stupid to say that a single genetic difference causes all depression. The article that supersport cites all but spells this out. (But since when does supersport actually read his \"sources\" for comprehension?) In fact, that article, contrary to his assertion to thelmoose, explains no genetic mechanism for depression but only a doctor-suspected relationship. Furthermore, even should supersport try to support this view using his earlier citation, the article in question posits a beneficial effect of this gene. This dispatches with supersport's objection to a \"non-beneficial\" gene spreading through the population \"so fast\" without our even having to explain to him that he can't even show that said gene actually did spread through the population \"so fast.\" Sure, he's wrong for other reasons, too (improvement in diagnostic abilities and techniques, for example), but this one's his own source, so I like using it.\n \n The indisputable fact is that there can be many causes of depression, and it's perfectly logical to think that a slightly less active seratonin receptor can play a part. But to attribute all depression to this is to ignore the years of research that finds correlation between livelihoods or upbringings and depression, and that finds depression resulting from traumatic (obviously non-genetically changing) events.\n \n If supersport intends to \"counter\" this reasoning with claims of plasticity, he will need to[*]show (statistically, to make it plausible) that all people who have diagnosed permanent problems (those that traditional psychology/psychiatry attribute to traumatic or difficult life events) possess at least one \"mutant\" allele[*]show (statistically) that all people clinically diagnosed as not depressed possess at least one wild-type allele.[*]show the appropriate literature showing that people who suffer from depression on a non-permanent basis (e.g. post-partem depression) possess both the wild-type and the \"mutant\" alleles[*]show that non-permanent depression sufferers' symptoms correlate with the activation of the \"mutant\" allele[*]show that the relief of non-permanent sufferers' symptoms correlate with the deactivation of the \"mutant\" allele (and, if necessary, the reactivation of the wild-type allele)I look forward to seeing the appropriate sources, supersport.",

Evolutionsts have stressed time and time again that the variations from which evolution stems are random in this sense.\"\n \n so I'd say you are there...\n ------------------------------\n You obviously did not read the article...here it is again:\n \n They found that compensatory mutations occurred in both habitats, but, to their surprise, they discovered that the way the genetic material changed differed significantly depending upon the environment. In the case of streptomycin-resistant bacteria in mice, they found ten cases of identical compensatory mutations within the resistance gene. In contrast, this gene never mutated in the lab-cultured bacteria, where they found fourteen compensatory mutations in genes outside the resistance gene. Evidently, the environment had everything to do with what kind of mutations occurred\n \n Also, I must say you are the very first person that I've heard that ever attempts to use adaptive mutations as evidence for your theory.\n \n But if it has been shown that there is such thing as adaptive mutations, this would qualify as an exception -- there can be no such exceptions to your theory. if ONE bacteria proves to be adaptive, your whole theory must fall.

   "However, it seems that a large number of people in our society are coming down with Depression and lots of other assorted 'diseases.\" And it's now coming out that supposedly a mutation is causing this phenomenon.\n \n http://www.webmd.com/content/article/98/104740.htm\n \n So my question is....how has Depression infiltrated society so quickly? I mean for an accidental mutation to take place and then spread throughout 250 million people, it would logically take hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n \n Let's look at the article and compare it to your numbers:\n \"the finding may shed new light on depression, which affects almost 19 million Americans per year, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. \"\n \n So where do you get \"250 million people\"? At most we have 25 million people with depression. That's 10% of the population.\n \n BUT, do all people with depression have the mutation? NOPE\n \n \"Finally, the researchers traced the mutation among people with depression. They studied the genes of 87 people with major depression and found that more than 10% (nine people) carried the mutation. In people without depression, only 1% of people carried the mutation. \"\n \n So, only 10 %of people with depression have the mutation. Since 10% of the population has depression and only 10% of people with depresssion have the mutation, that means that  at most only 1% of the total population has the mutation. \n \n So much for your premise of \"widespread\". \n \n \nSo how exactly is this Depression mutation \"beneficial?\" Evolutionists say that only the beneficial mutations will spread out over the population.\n\n \n Since the mutation has not spread thruout the population, we don't have to worry about this.\n \n As you said, humans are pretty immune to selection because of their technology. Hardy-Weinberg says that alleles will maintain their frequency in the absence of selection. So we would expect this frequency to remain pretty constant.\n \n Also notice that the mutation doesn't produce depression very frequently and that 1% of people without depression have the mutation. So the correlation between mutation and depression is not absolute.\n \n \n since most every person in society is, in fact, able to breed, wouldn't it make sense that evolutionary change would have to come to a halt in humans? I mean, since most everyone can breed, wouldn't any mutations that happened get quickly watered down and eliminated?\n\n \n Natural selection is weak in humans. It's weak at producing changes in any very large population. That's one reason why we have stasis in the fossil record. It is much easier for alleles to become fixed in small populations. \n \n Also it seems that instead of the beneficial traits spreading out across a population, it's the CRUMMY/destructive traits that seem to be doing that. What's up with that?\n \n \n Finally....would you say that the Anger/Road Rage gene accidentally mutated and spread out across the population the same way? How would Anger or Road Rage be an advantageous trait? Is that some sort of strange survival trait where if one doesn't flip somebody off or get out of his car to start a fight that he will somehow be better able to breed??? emoticon_confused \n \n http://preventdisease.com/news/artic...reditary.shtml\n\n \n The link doesn't work. This is the first I've heard of a \"road rage\" gene.\n \n However, I can postulate a set of alleles that would trigger anger in the face of frustration or danger. Such an set would be advantageous in a primitive society subject to attack by predators. The resulting anger would counter fear and cause the human to act in defense.\n \n \n And just when you think evolutionary theory can't get any weirder -- these genius evolutionist scientists come along and try to tell us that Depression is a BENEFICIAL trait!! Do they think we're that dumb? I guess so!!!\n \n -------------------------------\n \"In Dr. Randolph Nesse and George C. Williams, PhD's book, \"Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine,\" they consider depression to be helpful for several reasons. Sadness will change one's behavior, thereby stopping the current harmful activity or prevent future harmful activities. We can behave differently after a loss so then our future looks more positive in three steps. First, stop what you are doing; so then the damaging action is then stopped. Secondly, set aside the common human tendency of optimism. Studies have found that most people often overestimate their effectiveness and abilities. Finally, we can take off the \"rose-colored glasses.\" Once this is done, then we can reasses our goals and strategies more objectively\" (Nesse and Williams, 1999).\n\n \n Do you have a reading comprehension problem? The quote doesn't talk about depression, but sadness as being beneficial. Depression and sadness are different. \n \n Now, if depression and sadness are polygenic (and nearly all traits are), then having many of the alleles for sadness is fine -- beneficial. However, if you get all the alleles, that is depression, which is detrimental. The few people unlucky enough to get the full suite of alleles does not affect the beneficial effect of 90% of people being able to feel sadness.",

   "But if it has been shown that there is such thing as adaptive mutations, this would qualify as an exception -- there can be no such exceptions to your theory.\n\n \n Why not? Why would some mutations that are a response to the environment invalidate modern evolutionary theory? Especially since we see that some mutations are not in response to the environment, as your sources clearly state......\n \"For example, there are strains of E. coli that have lost the capacity to utilize the sugar lactose as a source of energy. If such a strain is cultured in a starvation medium with lactose as the only energy source, most of the bacteria remain in a stationary phase until they die. But under these conditions some of the bacteria begin to hypermutate, which means they rapidly create a large number of mutations and among these are ones that allow them to live from lactose. The bacteria with this ability survive, multiply and form new colonies. In at least some cases such adaptive mutations arise only in the specific medium-that is, the mutations allowing bacteria to utilize lactose don't occur when bacteria are grown in a medium with sugars other than lactose.\"\n \n You failed to comment on this passage, which clearly states that while the mutation rate increased, the mutations were still random. And those random mutations were selected for by the enviroment.\n \n \nAlso, I must say you are the very first person that I've heard that ever attempts to use adaptive mutations as evidence for your \n theory.\n\n \n You're kidding, really you're not serious are you?\n \n \nBut if it has been shown that there is such thing as adaptive mutations, this would qualify as an exception -- there can be no such exceptions to your theory. if ONE bacteria proves to be adaptive, your whole theory must fall. \n\n \n Wrong, all we have to show is one neutral mutation and your claim is disproven.\n \n As to the examples you use, I found this to be of interest, from here:\n http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=2704747&dopt=Abstract\n \"Before the hypothesis of directed mutation is accepted, it is imperative to consider alternative hypotheses that might account for the same observations. To this end, we expand upon existing mathematical theory of the dynamics of mutation and selection in clonal populations for two cases of particular interest. The first case concerns selection against mutants before plating; this selection occurs as the result of differences in growth rate between mutants and nonmutants. We demonstrate that this selection model gives rise to distributions of mutants, obtained by plating from sister cultures, that are very similar to those expected when some mutations are induced by the selective environment. The second case concerns the sequential incorporation of two mutations as the result of selection for an intermediate genotype after plating. We demonstrate that this two-step mutation model also yields distributions that are similar to those expected when some mutations are induced by the selective environment. These two cases therefore provide alternatives to the hypothesis of directed mutation.\"\n \n So your examples are far from proven. Here we see new research that gives an evolutionary explaination for why these mutations appear to be directed but in fact are not. What research can you provide that refutes it?\n \n And from here:\n http://www.dhushara.com/book/evol/evev.htm\n \"Most biologists now believe-and Cairns has acknowledged-that the seeming excess of beneficial mutations found in many directed-mutation studies might arise because researchers are more likely to spot and so count beneficial events than they are harmful ones. Various theories have been advanced to explain why, although none has gained universal acceptance. Recent experiments, however, provide important evidence for one effect that could produce such a counting bias. The effect, hypermutation, thus might make true directed mutation unnecessary.\"\n Once again, evolutionary explainations for seemingly directed mutations. \n \n From the same site:\n \"The appearance of directed mutation might thus arise \"with no requirement for new molecular mechanisms,\" Moxon and Thaler surmise. The scientists suggest further that if physiological factors can influence hypermutable genes, perhaps separate mutator genes can also switch on and off hypermutable genes. Mutation rates would then be subject to fine-grained genetic control. Thaler says that \"the mechanisms for the generation of variants are themselves subject to evolution.\" It might take another decade to learn whether evolution routinely plays such a sophisticated game with mutation rates. But one piece of unpublished work lends support to the notion that mutator genes might have a part in how hypermutation simulates directed mutation. Hall has recently isolated five bacterial genes that make excess favorable mutations seem to appear elsewhere in the bacterial DNA. Hall thinks his newly isolated genes somehow stimulate hypermutation and so generate the illusion of overabundant advantageous mutations. \"In my gut I feel it's an evolved phenomenon,\" he says. Pure directed mutation, with its spooky foreknowledge, may be dead. But real mechanisms that produce the ghost of directed mutation could yet shake up biology. \"In evolutionary theory there has been ani overemphasis on the power of selection as opposed to the generation of diversity,\" Thaler goes on to reflect. \"Maybe this will take it to an other level.\" \"\n \n Once again, no directed mutation, but evolution generated hypermutation.\n \n You've made the same creationist mistakes, misunderstanding the data, extrapolating invalid, illogical claims from real research that you don't understand, ignoring follow up research because it disproves your claims.",

How do you feel about the term \"truth\" and/or \"reality\"? \n\n \n Notice that you said \"ANY experience\". Think of any movie ever made. There are some people that have an enjoyable experience at that movie, and some that have an unenjoyable experience. Same movie, but the experiences and reactions to it are not intersubjective. Yet the movie is a reality we share.\n \n Do you like brussels sprouts? What do they taste like to you? To me, they taste very bitter and have a taste I have no word for but causes me to involuntarily to gag and even vomit. Yet many people say brussels sprouts taste \"sweet\" or \"salty\" and are pleasant. We all share a reality that includes brussels sprouts, but we don't share the same taste to them.\n \n Yes, I do firmly believe that there is an objective reality out there. I have to in order to do science. That means, of course, that a deity either objectively exists or does not. What people believe about the matter is irrelevant to that. What we are trying to do is find valid criteria to decide the objective existence of deity. \n \n Science won't do that, at least now. Maybe someday, if we can figure out a way around Methodological Materialism. The points I'm making right now is:\n 1. All evidence is personal experience.\n 2. Science is only a subset of personal experience. You can't say the subset is all of it or that we can only require intersubjective experience.\n 3. People report personal experience of deity. \n 4. There is no way to dismiss all that personal experience without:a. Changing science beyond recognition\n b. Using circular logic and eliminating personal experience of deity for the sole reason that it IS evidence of deity.\n \nWould not the Holocaust have intersubjectivity at least for those who witnessed it or saw its apparatuses? Would not the science of statistics be able to verify the missings victims?\n\n 1. Yes, for the people involved. But it's not intersubjective to you or me, because we weren't there. Similarly, the Parting of the Red Sea was intersubjective to everyone who was there, but not to you or me. We can't go to the shore of the Red Sea, raise our hands, and have the sea part. It was a one-time event that left no physical evidence for us to study in the present.\n 2. Statistics simply tell us whether we got our samples from one population or two. So statistics could tell us that death rates between 1939-1945 for Jews was higher than death rates in the 6 years before or the 6 years after that period. However the death rates for EVERY population in Europe during those years was high. Statistics won't tell you how the people died.\n \n \nWhat is the point of making allowances for any notion not strictly forbidden or disprovable?\n\n \n So you don't falsely eliminate something that does exist. Let's take this to an example favorable to atheism. \n \n There are currently 5 hypotheses for First Cause -- the uncaused Cause that started the universe. One of them is God created the universe. Another one is Hawking-Hartle No Boundary Proposal. Hawking arbitrarily picked the parameters in No Boundary such that the result was a universe like we live in. No Boundary is not falsifiable. The fact that it is not falsified, however, allows atheism to say \"Look, there are other options on the table for First Cause other than God, therefore you cannot say that God must have created the universe. We have a notion that is not strictly forbidden or disprovable.\"",

   "There is nothing that you can show me.\n\n \n Right. The experience is not intersubjective. YOU don't have the experience, so there's nothing to show you. That's why theism is a faith.\n \n My point only was that there is evidence, not that you were required to be convinced by it.\n \n Now, what is YOUR experience of deity? You don't have any, do you? Therefore YOUR experience is lack of experience. Now, \"Just because you had an experiance doesn't mean that your interpretation has anything to do with reality.\" There are lots of possible hypotheses to explain your lack of experience other than \"deity does not exist\".\n \n \nSchizophrenitcs hear voices. Some of them say it is the spirits of the dead talking to them. This is a chemical brain imbalance, not spirits of the dead.\n\n \n True. But the reports of theists do not match the experiences of schizophrenics. Apples and oranges. You've made a strawman.\n \n \nYou see, your claim for personal experiance for 'god' can only show you beleive the experiance you have shows god. You can't test that at all.\n\n \n Actually, the experience can be tested to some extent. Theists themselves test it. When CS Lewis was having his very intense personal experiences, he was an atheist. He called friends over because Lewis thought he might be going insane. So Lewis did test his experiences and one of the tests was to test his sanity. Outside people can test it to see if the experiences correlate with diet, sleep deprivation, etc. So far, I haven't seen any such correlation. Have you? \n \n As I said, in all other aspects of their lives, nearly all theists claiming personal experience of deity are sane and trustworthy in all their other accounts -- such as the food and service at a particular restaurant, personal evaluations of movies and other artistic events, etc. \n \n \nIf something can't be tested for, it isn't evidence.\n\n \n 1. Define \"tested\". It appears here that you are trying to say that the only evidence is intersubjective evidence. That has already been shown to be wrong.\n \n 2. As noted, the theists do test their experiences. So, the \"something\" is tested, but it's not intersubjective.\n \n In general, what disturbs me about the general line of argument (dismissing evidence for deity) is:\n 1. The harm it does to science.\n 2. The irrationality of it. Denying the existence of evidence is a terrible argument. It leads into all types of inconsistencies and dishonesty. Look at what happens when creationists try to deny the evidence for evolution. Gish is inconsistent and dishonest when trying to dismiss Archie and Lucy as intermediates. I'm seeing a similar thing here. Trebor, in previous posts you tried to defend your position by 1) ignoring what I said about the Bosnian rape victims (I explicitly said there was no physical evidence) and 2) trying to say we can accept the testimony of paratroopers because it was in the physical universe.\n \n But look at that. There is no way to test their testimony of things that have no physical evidence -- such as the unexploded shell landing in front of the foxhole or XXXX's run to the rear after the shelling at Bastogne. So by your new criteria, that is not evidence. Yet you were willing to accept it! Inconsistent.\n \n Also, in saying that we can accept personal experience because it is in the physical universe but reject personal experience when it is of the supernatural, it's not only inconsistent but dishonest. After all, what are we trying to determine? Whether there is a supernatural. So, if you say that personal experience is not valid because it is not of the physical, can't you see that this is intellectually dishonest? What is your criteria for dismissing the evidence? Only because it is of the supernatural and hot the \"physical\".",

It's much more subtle and less for public display than that. Also, born again seems to serve a pleasurable purpose for the person. Personal experiences of deity doesn't fit that.\n \n \"Therefore, before proceeding further, we shall give the floor temporarily tho those who claim they have experiential evidence of God, and allow them to clarify what they mean by such evidence. ... However, when it comes to the nature of experience of the presence of God, there is an astounding degree of consensus. The following statements, in order to keep us as close to the source as possible, come not from the past but from our contemporaries, from persons with whom I have spoken directly. They are, however, echoed throughout the history and literature of religion.\n \"The experience is usually not 'spooky'. It sometimes, though definitely not always, might be termed 'mystical'. It doesn't for the most part consist of events which by their nature overturn or challenge the laws of science. (I've heard only one first-hand account of an event which, if it really happened, would be very difficult to explain by any process presently known to science.) The experience doesn't establish a hot-line to God, by which all questions are answered, all doubts set aside, and complete understanding is reached. ... People are quick to point out that, though they think their experience really is of God, it is, even at its clearest and best, only a partial, human, inadequate view of what God really is and what God is really doing. Experiential evidence sometimes comes in a flash, but it's more often the accumulation of more subtle experiences over a period of time.\n \"John S. Spong .... 'I do not mean to suggest that I have arrived at some mystical plateau where my search has ended, where doubts are no more, or that I now possess some unearthly peace of mind. Nothing could be further from the truth. I have only arrived at a point where the search has a validity because I have tasted the reality of this presence, if ever so slightly.'\n \"As to finding God initially, some say they came rather gradually to a realization that the God they'd learned about in books, songs, and from other people, is real. Others on the contrary battered the gates of heaven .. with very sceptical demands for answers, IF such a heaven existed. Their uncompromising intellectuality led them to try to pin God to the wall in ways that might be expected to elicit a lightning bolt rather than blessing. Their requirements for evidence and proofs were seldom met exactly as specified, but there was a moment in the process when they realized to their astonishment that they were wrestling with a real being who couldn't be contained in human descriptions or standards, not a concept or an abstraction. This God was something out of their control, something not fashioned in the image they had formed in their mind ...\n \"The testimony is of God's leadership being requested and and received at turning points where human foresight and knowledge were inadequate, and of God's leadership turning out to be exactly on target, though perhaps not in the direction one would have preferred. ... God has stopped some persons dead, when they did not want to be stopped, on the brink of serious mistakes. God has changes some in ways human beings can't change themselves even with allthe help of psychotherapy. God has made it possible for them to love the unlovable, forgive the unforgiveable. ... Has all this been 'spritual' help? Not according to these witnesses. God is a powerful and active God, interveining wherever, whenever, and through whatever avenue he pleases. The phrase 'the insidiousness of God' comes from a woman Episcopal priest. God's intervention is not always kind, gentle, or pleasurable. He refuses to play by human rules or indulge our desire to plan ahead. ... God does not always come at our coalling, give us what we want, or even shield us from terrible pain or grief ... but God's forgiveness and love know no limits whatsoever. \n \"Some direct quotes: 'My relationship with God has been by far and away the most demanding relationship in my life.' 'The Lord has been my strongest support, but also my most frustrating opponent.' 'If I didn't absolutely know this is the only game in town, I'd sure as hell get out of it!' ''The best evidence isn't some 'wonder' or 'miracle', and it certainly isn't success, happiness, or the peace of having my prayers answered in ways which suit me. It's the extraordinary, topsy-turvy, interesting course my life has taken since I've engaged in this -- once begun, virtually inescapable -- dialogue with God.\" Kitty Ferguson's The Fire in the Equations, pp 248- 251.",

   "Notice that you said \"ANY experience\". Think of any movie ever made. There are some people that have an enjoyable experience at that movie, and some that have an unenjoyable experience. Same movie, but the experiences and reactions to it are not intersubjective. Yet the movie is a reality we share.\n\n \n I'm not sure this makes a salient point. Everyone sees the same movie, but their experience is not based upon the same information. Personal prediliction for the genre, actors, directing style and so forth also influence whether they enjoy the production.\n \n Even that does not deny intersubjectivity: I might not be able to show you the same enjoyable experience of watching a particular film, but there would still be an identifiable reason for that failure, no more inherently mysterious than your failure to see the face of a sculpture when stood behind it. Moreover I could, in principle and with reasonable confidence, select someone who would share my enjoyment, knowing nothing other than mundane facts about their general preferences.\n \n \nthen we come to your question: why haven't theists decided that Yahweh, Allah, and Vishnu are wrong?\n\n \n I think it's presumptuous to ask that question in that way. What is Yahweh? He is the creator-god of the Old Testament. But creation did not occur in the manner described in the Old Testament. Whatever you choose to believe in, as an evolutionist, it is not Yahweh but rather a compromise designed - by humans - to accommodate our scientific understanding. Theists have decided that Yahweh is wrong; they just call what they've replaced him with by the same name. Personally, I don't feel answering the question \"Can we contrive something it is not impossible to believe in?\" makes any headway towards answering the question \"Is there a god?\"\n \n \n1. All evidence is personal experience.\n 2. Science is only a subset of personal experience. You can't say the subset is all of it or that we can only require intersubjective experience.\n 3. People report personal experience of deity.\n 4. There is no way to dismiss all that personal experience without:\n \n a. Changing science beyond recognition\n b. Using circular logic and eliminating personal experience of deity for the sole reason that it IS evidence of deity.\n\n \n 1. But all personal experience is not evidence - at least, not necessarily evidence for what we think it is. Our physiology makes us all vulnerable to the same optical illusions, for instance, but that is not evidence that those funky interlocking spirals are really rotating. Rather it is evidence for the fallibility of our perception.\n \n 2. True, but its significance is somewhat undermined by 1. above.\n \n 3. They report a personal experience which they attribute to deity. Having watched Derren Brown convince a roomful of people that they are communing with the spirit of a murdered girl who is in fact sitting perfectly unharmed in a coach outside, I would say our individual ability to accurately attribute the source of an experience can easily be called into question.\n \n 4. I'm not sure science ever 'dismisses' personal experience; rather it would seek to find the best explanation for it. The real argument comes in our determination of what 'best' means. It has generally served us well to refrain from inventing more entities than are necessary to explain a phenomenon. Do we need a god to explain the phenomenon of belief in one?",

And why?\n\n \n Well, if you believe allot of the bible (and that it was inspired by God) you're most likely to believe the whole of it. \n \n Take for example the Genisis account of how the earth came about. This account was written thousands of years ago (way before man had any decent scientific knowledge), and yet it makes total scientific sense. Here's a section from a book I own (Life-How did it get here, by creation or evolution), please read it carefully:\n \n What Does Genesis Say?\n \n AS WITH other things that are misrepresented or misunderstood, the first chapter of the Bible deserves at least a fair hearing. The need is to investigate and determine whether it harmonizes with known facts, not to mold it to fit some theoretical framework. Also to be remembered, the Genesis account was not written to show the \"how\" of creation. Rather, it covers major events in a progressive way, describing what things were formed, the order in which they were formed and the time interval, or \"day,\" in which each first appeared.\n \n 2 When examining the Genesis account, it is helpful to keep in mind that it approaches matters from the standpoint of people on earth. So it describes events as they would have been seen by human observers had they been present. This can be noted from its treatment of events on the fourth Genesis \"day.\" There the sun and moon are described as great luminaries in comparison to the stars. Yet many stars are far greater than our sun, and the moon is insignificant in comparison to them. But not to an earthly observer. So, as seen from the earth, the sun appears to be a 'greater light that rules the day' and the moon a 'lesser light that dominates the night.'-Genesis 1:14-18.\n \n 3 The first part of Genesis indicates that the earth could have existed for billions of years before the first Genesis \"day,\" though it does not say for how long. However, it does describe what earth's condition was just before that first \"day\" began: \"Now the earth proved to be formless and waste and there was darkness upon the surface of the watery deep; and God's active force was moving to and fro over the surface of the waters.\"-Genesis 1:2.\n \n How Long Is a Genesis \"Day\"?\n \n 4 Many consider the word \"day\" used in Genesis chapter 1 to mean 24 hours. However, in Genesis 1:5 God himself is said to divide day into a smaller period of time, calling just the light portion \"day.\" In Genesis 2:4 all the creative periods are called one \"day\": \"This is a history of the heavens and the earth in the time of their being created, in the day [all six creative periods] that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.\"\n \n 5 The Hebrew word yohm, translated \"day,\" can mean different lengths of time. Among the meanings possible, William Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies includes the following: \"A day; it is frequently put for time in general, or for a long time; a whole period under consideration .#.#. Day is also put for a particular season or time when any extraordinary event happens.\"1 This last sentence appears to fit the creative \"days,\" for certainly they were periods when extraordinary events were described as happening. It also allows for periods much longer than 24 hours.\n \n 6 Genesis chapter 1 uses the expressions \"evening\" and \"morning\" relative to the creative periods. Does this not indicate that they were 24 hours long? Not necessarily. In some places people often refer to a man's lifetime as his \"day.\" They speak of \"my father's day\" or \"in Shakespeare's day.\" They may divide up that lifetime \"day,\" saying \"in the morning [or dawn] of his life\" or \"in the evening [or twilight] of his life.\" So 'evening and morning' in Genesis chapter 1 does not limit the meaning to a literal 24 hours.\n \n 7 \"Day\" as used in the Bible can include summer and winter, the passing of seasons. (Zechariah 14:8) \"The day of harvest\" involves many days. (Compare Proverbs 25:13 and Genesis 30:14.) A thousand years are likened to a day. (Psalm 90:4; 2#Peter 3:8,#10) \"Judgment Day\" covers many years. (Matthew 10:15; 11:22-24) It would seem reasonable that the \"days\" of Genesis could likewise have embraced long periods of time-millenniums. What, then, took place during those creative eras? Is the Bible's account of them scientific? Following is a review of these \"days\" as expressed in Genesis.\n \n First \"Day\"\n \n 8 \"'Let light come to be.' Then there came to be light. And God began calling the light Day, but the darkness he called Night. And there came to be evening and there came to be morning, a first day.\"-Genesis 1:3,#5.\n \n 9 Of course the sun and moon were in outer space long before this first \"day,\" but their light did not reach the surface of the earth for an earthly observer to see. Now, light evidently came to be visible on earth on this first \"day,\" and the rotating earth began to have alternating days and nights.\n \n 10 Apparently, the light came in a gradual process, extending over a long period of time, not instantaneously as when you turn on an electric light bulb. The Genesis rendering by translator J.#W. Watts reflects this when it says: \"And gradually light came into existence.\" (A Distinctive Translation of Genesis) This light was from the sun, but the sun itself could not be seen through the overcast. Hence, the light that reached earth was \"light diffused,\" as indicated by a comment about verse 3 in Rotherham's Emphasised Bible.-See footnote b for verse 14.\n \n Second \"Day\"\n \n 11 \"'Let an expanse come to be in between the waters and let a dividing occur between the waters and the waters.' Then God proceeded to make the expanse and to make a division between the waters that should be beneath the expanse and the waters that should be above the expanse. And it came to be so. And God began to call the expanse Heaven.\"-Genesis 1:6-8.\n \n 12 Some translations use the word \"firmament\" instead of \"expanse.\" From this the argument is made that the Genesis account borrowed from creation myths that represent this \"firmament\" as a metal dome. But even the King James Version Bible, which uses \"firmament,\" says in the margin, \"expansion.\" This is because the Hebrew word ra&#8231;qi&#8242;a&#8219;, translated \"expanse,\" means to stretch out or spread out or expand.\n \n 13 The Genesis account says that God did it, but it does not say how. In whatever way the described separation occurred, it would look as though the 'waters above' had been pushed up from the earth. And birds could later be said to fly in \"the expanse of the heavens,\" as stated at Genesis 1:20.\n \n Third \"Day\"\n \n 14 \"'Let the waters under the heavens be brought together into one place and let the dry land appear.' And it came to be so. And God began calling the dry land Earth, but the bringing together of the waters he called Seas.\" (Genesis 1:9,#10) As usual, the account does not describe how this was done. No doubt, tremendous earth movements would have been involved in the formation of land areas. Geologists would explain such major upheavals as catastrophism. But Genesis indicates direction and control by a Creator.\n \n 15 In the Biblical account where God is described as questioning Job about his knowledge of the earth, a variety of developments concerning earth's history are described: its measurements, its cloud masses, its seas and how their waves were limited by dry land-many things in general about the creation, spanning long periods of time. Among these things, comparing earth to a building, the Bible says that God asked Job: \"Into what have its socket pedestals been sunk down, or who laid its cornerstone?\"-Job 38:6.\n \n 16 Interestingly, like \"socket pedestals,\" earth's crust is much thicker under continents and even more so under mountain ranges, pushing deep into the underlying mantle, like tree roots into soil. \"The idea that mountains and continents had roots has been tested over and over again, and shown to be valid,\" says Putnam's Geology.2 Oceanic crust is only about 5 miles thick, but continental roots go down about 20 miles and mountain roots penetrate about twice that far. And all earth's layers press inward upon earth's core from all directions, making it like a great \"cornerstone\" of support.\n \n 17 Whatever means were used to accomplish the raising up of dry land, the important point is: Both the Bible and science recognize it as one of the stages in the forming of the earth.\n \n Land Plants on Third \"Day\"\n \n 18 The Bible account adds: \"'Let the earth cause grass to shoot forth, vegetation bearing seed, fruit trees yielding fruit according to their kinds, the seed of which is in it, upon the earth.' And it came to be so.\"-Genesis 1:11.\n \n 19 Thus by the close of this third creative period, three broad categories of land plants had been created. The diffused light would have become quite strong by then, ample for the process of photosynthesis so vital to green plants. Incidentally, the account here does not mention every \"kind\" of plant that came on the scene. Microscopic organisms, water plants and others are not specifically named, but likely were created on this \"day.\"\n \n Fourth \"Day\"\n \n 20 \"'Let luminaries come to be in the expanse of the heavens to make a division between the day and the night; and they must serve as signs and for seasons and for days and years. And they must serve as luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to shine upon the earth.' And it came to be so. And God proceeded to make the two great luminaries, the greater luminary for dominating the day and the lesser luminary for dominating the night, and also the stars.\"-Genesis 1:14-16; Psalm 136:7-9.\n \n 21 Previously, on the first \"day,\" the expression \"Let light come to be\" was used. The Hebrew word there used for \"light\" is 'ohr, meaning light in a general sense. But on the fourth \"day,\" the Hebrew word changes to ma&#8231;'ohr&#8242;, which means the source of the light. Rotherham, in a footnote on \"Luminaries\" in the Emphasised Bible, says: \"In ver. 3, '\u00f4r ['ohr], light diffused.\" Then he goes on to show that the Hebrew word ma&#8231;'ohr&#8242; in verse 14 means something \"affording light.\" On the first \"day\" diffused light evidently penetrated the swaddling bands, but the sources of that light could not have been seen by an earthly observer because of the cloud layers still enveloping the earth. Now, on this fourth \"day,\" things apparently changed.\n \n 22 An atmosphere initially rich in carbon dioxide may have caused an earth-wide hot climate. But the lush growth of vegetation during the third and fourth creative periods would absorb some of this heat-retaining blanket of carbon dioxide. The vegetation, in turn, would release oxygen-a requirement for animal life.\n \n 23 Now, had there been an earthly observer, he would be able to discern the sun, moon and stars, which would \"serve as signs and for seasons and for days and years.\" (Genesis 1:14) The moon would indicate the passing of lunar months, and the sun the passing of solar years. The seasons that now \"came to be\" on this fourth \"day\" would no doubt have been much milder than they became later on.-Genesis 1:15; 8:20-22.\n \n Fifth \"Day\"\n \n 24 \"'Let the waters swarm forth a swarm of living souls and let flying creatures fly over the earth upon the face of the expanse of the heavens.' And God proceeded to create the great sea monsters and every living soul that moves about, which the waters swarmed forth according to their kinds, and every winged flying creature according to its kind.\"-Genesis 1:20,#21.\n \n 25 It is of interest to note that the nonhuman creatures with which the waters were to swarm are called \"living souls.\" This term would also apply to the \"flying creatures [that] fly over the earth upon the face of the expanse.\" And it would also embrace the forms of sea and air life, such as the sea monsters, whose fossil remains scientists have found in recent times.\n \n Sixth \"Day\"\n \n 26 \"'Let the earth put forth living souls according to their kinds, domestic animal and moving animal and wild beast of the earth according to its kind.' And it came to be so.\"-Genesis 1:24.\n \n 27 Thus on the sixth \"day,\" land animals characterized as wild and domestic appeared. But this final \"day\" was not over. One last remarkable \"kind\" was to come:\n \n 28 \"And God went on to say: 'Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and the domestic animals and all the earth and every moving animal that is moving upon the earth.' And God proceeded to create the man in his image, in God's image he created him; male and female he created them.\"-Genesis 1:26,#27.\n \n 29 Chapter 2 of Genesis apparently adds some details. However, it is not, as some have concluded, another account of creation in conflict with that of chapter 1. It just takes up at a point in the third \"day,\" after dry land appeared but before land plants were created, adding details that were pertinent to the arrival of humans-Adam the living soul, his garden home, Eden, and the woman Eve, his wife.-Genesis 2:5-9, 15-18, 21,#22.\n \n 30 The foregoing is presented to help us understand what Genesis says. And this quite realistic account indicates that the creative process continued throughout a period of, not just 144 hours (6#\u00d7#24), but over many millenniums of time.\n \n How Did Genesis Know?\n \n 31 Many find it hard to accept this creation account. They contend that it is drawn from the creation myths of ancient peoples, primarily those from ancient Babylon. However, as one recent Bible dictionary noted: \"No myth has yet been found which explicitly refers to the creation of the universe\" and the myths \"are marked by polytheism and the struggles of deities for supremacy in marked contrast to the Heb[rew] monotheism of [Genesis] 1-2.\"3 Regarding Babylonian creation legends, the trustees of the British Museum stated: \"The fundamental conceptions of the Babylonian and Hebrew accounts are essentially different.\"4\n \n 32 From what we have considered, the Genesis creation account emerges as a scientifically sound document. It reveals the larger categories of plants and animals, with their many varieties, reproducing only \"according to their kinds.\" The fossil record provides confirmation of this. In fact, it indicates that each \"kind\" appeared suddenly, with no true transitional forms linking it with any previous \"kind,\" as required by the evolution theory.\n \n 33 All the knowledge of the wise men of Egypt could not have furnished Moses, the writer of Genesis, any clue to the process of creation. The creation myths of ancient peoples bore no resemblance to what Moses wrote in Genesis. Where, then, did Moses learn all these things? Apparently from someone who was there.\n \n 34 The science of mathematical probability offers striking proof that the Genesis creation account must have come from a source with knowledge of the events. The account lists 10 major stages in this order: (1)#a beginning; (2)#a primitive earth in darkness and enshrouded in heavy gases and water; (3)#light; (4)#an expanse or atmosphere; (5)#large areas of dry land; (6)#land plants; (7)#sun, moon and stars discernible in the expanse, and seasons beginning; (8)#sea monsters and flying creatures; (9)#wild and tame beasts, mammals; (10)#man. Science agrees that these stages occurred in this general order. What are the chances that the writer of Genesis just guessed this order? The same as if you picked at random the numbers 1 to 10 from a box, and drew them in consecutive order. The chances of doing this on your first try are 1 in 3,628,800! So, to say the writer just happened to list the foregoing events in the right order without getting the facts from somewhere is not realistic.\n \n 35 However, evolutionary theory does not allow for a Creator who was there, knew the facts and could reveal them to humans. Instead, it attributes the appearance of life on earth to the spontaneous generation of living organisms from inanimate chemicals. But could undirected chemical reactions relying on mere chance create life? Are scientists themselves convinced that this could happen? Please see the next chapter.",

   "People turn to theories when the information given is incomplete not not able to be understood.\n \n The Bible is the sacred text of Christians. It is also called the Scripture. The Bible is a challenging book and it is filled with spiritual treasures which Christians believe are truths that can bring peace, joy, power and new purpose to some one's life. For Christians the Bible gives a divine revelation which constitutes a foundation of their belief.\n The Bible comprises sixty-six books divided into the Old Testament, which has thirty nine books and the New Testament which has twenty seven books. The Old Testament was written prior to the coming of Jesus Christ and tells us how God called the children of Israel into existence. The Old Testament also contains books with accounts of the creation, the Fall of Man into sin following the temptation in the Garden of Eden, The Flood and Noah's Ark and the Ten Commandments handed over by God to Moses at Mount Sinai.\n The New Testament has stories about Jesus, the son of God. It describes the birth, life, death, resurrection and ascension of Jesus\n Unfortunately the Bible has many inconsistencies and contradictions. For example some Theologians believe that the Bible is incomplete and there are strong evidences that support this claim. Certain books such as the Gospel of St. Thomas, the Book of Jasher, the Gospel of Nicodemus and the Falling asleep of Mary are among the books excluded from the Bible and now constitute the Apocrypha. According to some opinions the Roman Catholic Church removed them because they were in conflict with their practices at that time.\n \n Consequently, many atheists and skeptics have attacked the Bible because of certain contradictions. For example, they believe that God did not create the world in six days. They believe that the universe came to be as a result of the Big Bang Theory (also known as the Steady State Theory). This hypothesis states that the Universe had no beginning but was formed and continues to grow through the spontaneous creation of hydrogen replacing matter from being destroyed. The question I would ask is where did the hydrogen come from?\n Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution, which states that man evolved from lower species and continued changing until they became homo sapiens i.e. man, contradicted the teachings of the Bible. The Bible reveals that God created Adam-the first man on earth and later He created a female companion from Adam's rib whom He called Eve.\n Unfortunately, evolution has its own flaws. The theory of evolution states that organisms evolve from stage to stage. Evolution also claims that man evolved from monkeys. If monkeys evolved into man why are there still monkeys? When this question was asked the evolutionist devised a new \"theory of natural selection\" to defend the evolution. Another interesting fact is that evolution is a continuous process. If it is true that the first man walked the surface of the earth some 3 million years ago why haven't we evolved to have some other characteristics such as wings, tails or eyes as large as a tennis ball?\n Another contradiction was the flooding of the whole world as contained in the Bible. According to Maurice Bucaille in his book\" The Bible, the Qur'an and Science\" he uses the flood as an example. Rain water was given as the cause of the flood by a group that called themselves Yahvists, while another group-the Sacredotals gives the flood a double cause:\" rain water and waters of the earth\"( also can be referred to as overflowing rivers and lakes). The earth was submerged right up to and above the mountain peaks. All life perished. After one year when water receded, Noah emerged from the Ark that had come to rest on Mount Arafat.. One might add that the flood lasted different length of time: Forty days ( Yahvist version), and one hundred and forty days in the Sacrodotal text and one year for others. In those days, people had limited knowledge of science, and so in some bibles the rain fall was regarded as \"the heaven opened\".\n In conclusion, the Bible means different things for different people. Saint Augustine considered that God could not teach man things that did not correspond to reality. However, the Bible in actual fact, without any human manipulation, which has led to historical error, contradictions, and improbabilities, was destined to be the \"witness of true teachings coming from God\".[/B]",
