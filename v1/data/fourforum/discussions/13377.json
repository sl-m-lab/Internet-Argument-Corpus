   "Wednesday, September 30, 2009\n Walmart Tops State Assistance Rolls in Ohio\n Free enterprise isn't really free enterprise when American taxpayers are subsidizing corporations.\n \n But in Ohio, responsible employers are being undercut by irresponsible big businesses who rely on the state to make up for the wages or health care they don't provide to their workers.\n \n And no surprise to regular readers of this blog--Walmart is at the top of the list.\n \n A new report released by Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, and promoted by the Ohio UFCW locals shows that Walmart has more employees on any kind of state assistance than any other employer. In fact, about 28% of Walmart's employees are on Medicaid alone! That's not counting Walmart workers on food stamps, CHIP, or other numerous taxpayer-funded program.\n \n The truth of the matter, is that Walmart's \"competitive\" business model can't compete without taxpayer subsidies. All of us have to bear the burden for their irresponsible corporate behavior--and that's unfair to responsible corporate citizens who compete with Walmart AND provide affordable, quality health care to their employees.\n \n So Walmart must change its ways. And as we look at health care reform, we need to make sure any reform includes strong employer responsibility provisions.\n \n We need to make sure that Walmart and other companies can't shirk their responsibilities and force responsible companies into an unfair situation.\n \n MyUFCW: Walmart Tops State Assistance Rolls in Ohio\n \n Geeze, I hate it when my tax dollar pads the huge money bags of the extremely riich Walton family even more.",

Its a good thing we got rid of that F-ing Bush with his high 4.5% unemployment rate and got the chosen one with his low 9.8% unemployment. How's that hope and change working for you?

I'm opposed to the profit motive in providing health care.\n \n And, I very much like what Eliot Spitzer has to say about the banking industry:\n \nToo many banks refuse to reform mortgages and refuse to lend to midsize companies yet simultaneously pursue the activities that do little to create jobs but do much to generate the type of paper profits that fueled the last bubble: proprietary trading, highly leveraged private-equity deals, and foreign investment. These activities are not the fuel for domestic job growth that federal dollars and guarantees should provide. They are also more likely to lead to significant losses that will once again require taxpayer intervention.\n \n For 50 years, under a regime of careful constraints on how and to whom banks lent, we avoided a meltdown of the sort we have just suffered though. The least we should now expect is a serious conversation about where banks should be active and how we can avoid rebuilding the same system that just collapsed.\n \n The message we should be sending is clear: If banks want to participate in the high-risk activity that generates outsize bonuses but also outsize risk, they must do so only with their own capital, separated from guaranteed deposits and a taxpayer backstop to their debt and borrowing capacity. Unfortunately, this message is not being sent. If, after all the fuss of supposed banking reform, we do not redefine the relationship between banks and their customers and redefine what banks do with our capital, we will have failed. We will get neither the real economic recovery we need nor the assurance that another round of bailouts will not be necessary in the near future.\n\n None of the Obama administration's banking reforms help middle-class Americans. - By Eliot Spitzer - Slate Magazine",

   "And now........another point of view.......\n \n \n\n Wal-Mart and the \"health\" of communities\n \n Another charge that local communities have made against Wal-Mart is that the company provides inadequate benefits and that local taxpayers are forced to pick up the burden. Critics say Wal-Mart's healthcare benefits are often so poor and the coverage is so expensive that many employees chose to go without it and instead get their coverage through state programs like Medicaid and or hospital charity. \n \n A November 2004 New York Times article cites a study in Georgia that found 10,000 children of Wal-Mart employees were in the state's healthcare program at a cost to taxpayers of $10 million a year. The same article describes a hospital in North Carolina that found that 31 percent of its 1,900 patients were Wal-Mart employees on Medicaid, and an additional 16 percent were Wal-Mart employees with no insurance at all. And in California, a study released in August 2004 by researchers at the University of California at Berkeley determined that the healthcare expenses of uninsured Wal-Mart employees were costing the already economically-strapped state $32 million a year in taxpayer funds. Wal-Mart has disputed findings that the company encourages its employees to apply for public assistance and called the California study \"biased,\" noting that the researchers at Berkeley did not contact the company for facts and statistics.\n \n Wal-Mart officials claim that 90 percent of its employees are insured either through the company's policies or elsewhere. Wal-Mart spokeswoman Sarah Clark told FRONTLINE that over 500,000 of the company's 1.2 million U.S. employees are insured by Wal-Mart and that the company insures a total of 900,000 employees and their dependents. According to Clark, 29 percent of Wal-Mart associates are ineligible for coverage. Stringent eligibility requirements and the employee turnover rate may account for that 29 percent: Full-time employees must work for six months before they can be covered, and part-time employees must work for at least two years. Wal-Mart's labor turnover rate is 44 percent per year -- close to the retail industry average. \n \n Wal-Mart's healthcare premiums are also high for the average associate's salary. Currently, Wal-Mart's employees must pay 33 percent of their healthcare costs: $30.50 a month for an individual or between $132.50 and $230.50 a month for families. Wal-Mart argues that its associates are a different demographic base than most companies' employees. \"One of the most significant facts is that about two-thirds of Wal-Mart associates are senior citizens, college students or second income providers, which also means that many of our associates receive their healthcare coverage from a parent, spouse or even Medicare,\" Wal-Mart spokeswoman Clark wrote in an e-mail to FRONTLINE. But Wal-Mart spokesperson Mona Williams admitted to the Los Angeles Times that Wal-Mart might not be the right job for a family breadwinner: \"Wal-Mart is a great match for a lot of people,\" she said. \"But if you are the sole provider for your family and do not have the time or the skills to move up the ladder, them maybe it's not the right place for you.\"frontline: is wal-mart good for america?: transforming: one, two, three, four ... we don't want your superstore | PBS \n\n \n BTW, I'm not surprised that a union website would be against Walmart.
