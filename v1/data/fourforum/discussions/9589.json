   "Washington's birthday is February 22. It was celebrated as a federal holiday until 1971 when Nixon proclaimed the insipid Presidents' Day. It implied that all presidents are equal, that Carter and Clinton are on a par with Washington. George Washington is the father of our country. His birthday should be reinstated as a national holiday.",
