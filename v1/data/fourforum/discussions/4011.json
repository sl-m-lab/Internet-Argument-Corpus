   "Many people state that the 4th demension is time. I really don't think that's true. In a 1-demensional world they could have time as well. I think it's more of a variable, or if you want to call it a demension it could be the first demension. So the first demension would be a point over time, the second would be a line through time, etc.\n \n The 4th/5th demension:\n \n This is purely theoretical but would explain the seemingly endlessness of the universe. What if we live in a 4-demensional world (5 if you include time)? The final dimension is at a right angle to all of our demensions much like up and down are at a right angle to left, right, forward, and backward. So think of what a 2-dimensional person would be like on a sphere. It would look to them like the place stretched for on and on as far as they could go. This would be much like when we move in 2 demensions on the Earth, only on a much larger scale and one demension higher. And black holes could be a 5-demensional object of some kind. Of course there's no way to verify or test this and I really don't believe it, but it's fun to think about.",

Keep in mind that temperature is a measure of a physical object -- really just the average kinetic energy of particles. Time is not a measurement of physical attributes; it is something beyond what we can see (not that we can actually see temperature) and describe physically. When someone asks \"what time is it?\" they are simply asking for the number that represents the position of the earth relative to the other parts of our solar system. Time between two points in existance can be measured finitely as a number by any time keeping tool. Time is just an infinite and somewhat undescribable property of our universe in which events can occur in a certain order, during a certain range/at any length, and at any 'time'. To make things easier for us, we have given points in this infinite span \"coordinates\", as Alan Ryan pointed out, so we can measure if finitely.\n As for the 4th-dimension, it is not known to most physicists as time. In mathematics, shapes with more than 3 dimensions are often referred to as Hypercubes. I have not studied or researched the subject of higher dimensions or physics, so I don't really have much of an opinion on the 4th-dimension as of yet. It's quite an intriguing subject though. :)",

   "OK. I wasn't in any way trying to say that temperature should be a dimension, just saying how it was sort of like time, I guess it was a bad example.

But as for the other dimensions, we move through them at will, backward, forward, still.

If you remove the partition, the gas will spread out to fill the whole box (cooling down a little as it does so). No matter how long you studied the box, you would never expect to see all the atoms of the gas move back into one half of the container, leaving empty space in the other half. Yet every collision between two particles in the box is, in principle, reversible. If we could reverse the motions of every particle the gas would have to go back to its original state. \n \n A physicist called Poincare showed that such an \"ideal gas\" trapped in a box must eventually pass through every possible arrangement of particles allowed by the laws of thermodynamics.

So, if we wait long enough, the system will return to its starting point and time will seem to run backwards.\n \n Here's the snag: according to Poincare, the time it would take for all the atoms to pass through all possible arrangements (called the Poincare cycle time) is related to the number of particles in the box: in a small box that contains \"only\" 10(22) atoms , it would take that many atoms a time much much longer than the age of the universe to pass through every possible arrangement.

The bottom camera chamber is usually at about 10^-6 torr and the chamber directly above it is at 10^-7 torr or lower. There is a micron-sized hole between the two chambers to allow the beam to go through to take a picture, but the pressures are so low that the chances of the pressure changing because of molecules going from one chamber to another are so low, that the hole is the best method to regulate the pressures between the two chambers and be able to take pictures.\n \n\n If we try to relate this idea to the theory of the Big Crunch: unless every action/reaction since the Big Bang was exactly reversed (after the arrow of time, so to speak, was turned around 180 degrees), the time it would take for time to run backwards would be more or less infinite.\n\n This was Stephen Hawking's big blunder.

You know when your waiting in traffic to get home during rush hour, time seems to slow down, yet when your doing something fun it seems to fly. Try defining time without using time in your definition. Here's how my definition attempts it:\n \n system of distinguishing events: a dimension that enables two identical events occurring at the same point in space to be distinguished, measured by the interval between the events. \n \n Microsoft\u00ae Encarta\u00ae Reference Library 2003. \u00a9 1993-2002 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\n \n And that pretty much nails it. But try defining how long a second is, or any period of time without using the word time. By the above definition time can flow in any direction or at any speed (I know, speed is dependant on time, it's all too confusing), As long as the same time doesn't happen more than once. We decide objectively time. So a minute is for example the time it takes for a rock to fall off a large cliff. But how do we know that at some points the rock doesn't fall faster (I know, dependant on time again :( but that's why we wouldn't know it was going \"faster\") at certain times than others. \n \n And on a sort of unrelated note what if we perceive time differently? What if when I went into your body/brain it looked like everyone was moving really fast. What if when a basketball player goes into the air and makes a save from out of bounds time really did \"slow down\" for him? It sure feels like it when something like that happens. I played third base in baseball last season for my team and a few balls that were hit really hard it would seem like time stood still. I didn't hear anything and all I saw was the ball heading towards me slowly. But when I got in front of it and put my glove in a position to catch it, it almost pops out because of the impact on the glove. I know it was going fast, and everyone else talks about lightning quick reflexes, but stuff like that isn't reflexes, it really seems as if time is going slower, is it? Is it just your brain's perception of time or do you actually slow down time? Of course it's hard to talk about speed when it's definition is distance over time, argh :)",

   "Time is the barrier that allows the present to exist by keeping it seperate from the future and the past. \n \n No two distinct particles may exist at the same point in space/time, and every point in space may be said to contain a particle at some point in time, therefore the universe simply could not exist without this barrier, as every particle would be omnipresent and overlap on every other particle.\n \n Time is the fourth dimension. Using a simple x,y,z,t coordinate system you can define the universe throughout eternity as a function of time. For any given t, each particle will have its own unique x,y, and z.\n \n About the glass concept, it is possible that the glass will \"fall\" together, despite the horrible thermodynamic reference, and as was previously stated this is limited only by the fact that, as is often the case with such matters, it has a very low probability of happening that way.\n \n As far as the four space dimensions, I contend that those who cannot imagine such things have a very limited control over their imaginations.",

   " Try defining how long a second is, or any period of time without using the word time.\n That's like challenging someone to define a unit of distance without using distance or a synonym for it. We have chosen a second as a unit which is based on other things that we can observe because as humans, we require a reference point to understand or describe things. This brings up the old paradigm that one cannot judge light without making reference to darkness.\n \n \nIs it just your brain's perception of time or do you actually slow down time? Of course it's hard to talk about speed when it's definition is distance over time, argh :)\n\n It is only your mind's perception of time that slows down. Actually time is perspective based in all cases. Since most of us are using the same point of reference, the Earth, time stays pretty constant for us.\n \n Einstein said when you sit on hot coals, minutes seem like hours; When you're with a lovely young woman, hours seem like minutes. That's relativity.",
