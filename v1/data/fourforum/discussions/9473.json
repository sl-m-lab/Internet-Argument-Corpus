   "**\n \"SCIENTIFIC ALTERNATIVES TO DARWINISM: IS THERE A ROLE FOR CELLULAR\n INFORMATION PROCESSING IN EVOLUTION?\"\n \n \n James A. Shapiro, Professor of Microbiology, Department of Biochemistry and\n Molecular Biology, University of Chicago\n \n \n \"The recent reviews in your columns of books by Dennet, Dawkins and\n Behe is testimony to the unflagging interest in controversies about\n evolution. Although purists like Dennet and Dawkins repeatedly assert that\n the scientific issues surrounding evolution are basically solved by\n conventional neo-Darwinism, the ongoing public fascination reveals a deeper\n wisdom. There are far more unresolved questions than answers about\n evolutionary processes, and contemporary science continues to provide us\n with new conceptual possibilities. Unfortunately, readers of the Boston\n Review may remain unaware of this intellectual ferment because the\n evolution debate so often assumes the quality of an abstract and\n philosophical \"dialogue of the deaf\" between Creationists and Darwinists.\n Although our knowledge of the molecular details of biological organization\n is undergoing a revolutionary expansion, serious open-minded discussions of\n the impact of discoveries in molecular biology are all too rare. The\n possibility of non-Darwinian scientific viewpoints is virtually never\n considered. The main argument of this essay, therefore, will be that\n developments in contemporary life science reveal many shortcomings in\n orthodox evolutionary theory and open the door to very different ways of\n formulating questions about the evolutionary process. After a discussion of\n technical advances in our views about genome organization and the\n mechanisms of genetic change, I will focus on a growing convergence between\n biology and information science which offers the potential for scientific\n investigation of possible intelligent cellular action in evolution.\n The past five decades of research in genetics and molecular\n biology have brought us revolutionary discoveries. Rather than confirm the\n oversimplified views of cellular organization and function held at\n mid-century, the molecular revolution has revealed an unanticipated realm\n of complexity and interaction more consistent with computer technology than\n with the mechanical viewpoint which dominated when the neo-Darwinian Modern\n Synthesis was formulated. The conceptual changes in biology are comparable\n in magnitude to the transition from classical physics to relativistic and\n quantum physics. I would like to single out four categories of molecular\n discoveries that open up exciting, new ways of thinking about the\n biological processes that underlie evolutionary change.\n (1) GENOME ORGANIZATION. Our current ideas of genome organization\n are completely different from the \"beads on a string\" view that dominated\n genetics in the 1940s and 1950s. At that time genes were \"units\" which\n corresponded to individual organismal traits, and the \"one gene-one enzyme\"\n hypothesis told us that the essential business of each gene was to encode a\n specific protein molecule linked to a particular phenotype. We have now\n deconstructed each genetic locus into a modular assembly of regulatory and\n coding motifs. Most of these motifs are shared between many loci,\n suggesting that genomes are assembled in Lego-like fashion from a\n repertoire of more basic sequence elements, many of which do not encode\n proteins but determine other important functions (transcription,\n translation, RNA processing, DNA replication, chromatin condensation,\n etc.). As we analyze genome expression during cellular proliferation and\n multicellular development, we have learned that diverse genetic loci are\n organized hierarchically into interconnected genome-wide networks which\n function dynamically. Not confined to a single pathway, many genetic loci\n are active at different times, participating in the expression of more than\n one phenotypic trait. Comparisons of genomes in different organisms have\n revealed unexpected patterns of evolutionary conservation across large\n taxonomic distances, while closely-related genomes frequently differ\n significantly in the arrangement of repetitive DNA elements which do not\n encode proteins.\n How all of this modularity, complexity and integration arose and\n changed during the history of life on earth is a central evolutionary\n question. Localized random mutation, selection operating \"one gene at a\n time\" (John Maynard Smith's formulation), and gradual modification of\n individual functions are unable to provide satisfactory explanations for\n the molecular data, no matter how much time for change is assumed. There\n are simply too many potential degrees of freedom for random variability and\n too many interconnections to account for.\n (2) CELLULAR REPAIR CAPABILITIES. Studies of the molecular sources\n of genetic variability have taught us two major lessons. The first of these\n lessons is that all cells from bacteria to man possess a truly astonishing\n array of repair systems which serve to remove accidental and stochastic\n sources of mutation. There are multiple levels of proofreading mechanisms\n which recognize and remove errors that inevitably occur during DNA\n replication. These proofreading systems are capable of distinguishing\n between newly synthesized and parental strands of the DNA double helix, so\n they operate efficiently to rectify rather than fix the results of\n accidental misincorporations of the wrong nucleotide. Other systems scan\n non-replicating DNA for chemical changes that could lead to miscoding and\n remove modified nucleotides, while additional functions monitor the pools\n of precursors and remove potentially mutagenic contaminants. In\n anticipation of chemical and physical insults to the genome, such as\n alkylating agents and ultraviolet radiation, additional repair systems are\n encoded in the genome and can be induced to correct damage when it occurs.\n It has been a surprise to learn how thoroughly cells protect themselves\n against the kinds of accidental genetic change that, according to\n conventional theory, are the sources of evolutionary variability. By virtue\n of their proofreading and repair systems, living cells are not passive\n victims of the random forces of chemistry and physics. They devote large\n resources to suppressing random genetic variation and have the capacity to\n set the level of background localized mutability by adjusting the activity\n of their repair systems.\n (3) MOBILE GENETIC ELEMENTS AND NATURAL GENETIC ENGINEERING. The\n other major lesson of molecular studies into the origins of genetic change\n is that all cells possess multiple biochemical agents for natural genetic\n engineering -- processes that include the cutting and splicing of DNA\n molecules into new sequence arrangements. Most frequently, natural genetic\n engineering capabilities reveal themselves through the activities of mobile\n genetic elements -- DNA structures found in all genomes that can move from\n one position to another. Mobile genetic elements comprise the most fluid\n components of the genome and are also the most taxonomically specific. In\n human cells, mobile elements include retrotransposons, like the half\n million or more Alu sequences dispersed over all our chromosomes, as well\n as the inherited gene fragments which our lymphocytes assemble daily to\n form active genetic loci encoding the key antigen recognition molecules of\n our immune system. The biochemical agents of DNA restructuring include the\n enzymes used in our own genetic engineering for research and biotechnology\n (nucleases, ligases, reverse transcriptases and polymerases) as well as\n other proteins that combine to form molecular machines capable of\n mobilizing different genomic components.\n The existence of cellular biochemical activities capable of\n rearranging DNA molecules means that genetic change can be specific (these\n activities can recognize particular sequence motifs) and need not be\n limited to one genetic locus (the same activity can operate at multiple\n sites in the genome). In other words, genetic change can be massive and\n non-random. Some organisms, such as the ciliated protozooan Oxytricha,\n completely reorganize their genetic apparatus within a single cell\n generation, fragmenting the germ-line chromosomes into thousands of pieces\n and then reassembling a particular subset of them into a distinct kind of\n functional genome. Furthermore, natural genetic engineering systems can\n operate premeiotically during the somatic development of tissues that will\n ultimately produce gametes. This means that major chromosome\n reorganizations can be present in multiple gametes. Consequently, the\n appearance of new genome architectures during evolution is not necessarily\n limited to isolated individuals.\n The discovery that genome reorganization is largely a biological\n process traces back to Barbara McClintock's pioneering studies of mutation\n and chromosome rearrangement in maize from the 1940s through the 1960s. She\n linked these genetic events to changes in the regulation of gene expression\n programs during plant development. We can now appreciate her tremendous\n wisdom and foresight by seeing how the Lego-like patterns of integrated\n genome organization mentioned above could be created by the activity of\n cellular natural genetic engineering systems. Because, like all cellular\n functions, natural genetic engineering systems are subject to control\n circuits, they can be held in abeyance for long periods and then called\n into action at certain key times. Sometimes these activations can be\n regularly programmed, as in the development of our immune systems, and\n sometimes activations can occur in response to crisis, as McClintock\n documented in maize.\n The point of this discussion is that our current knowledge of\n genetic change is fundamentally at variance with postulates held by\n neo-Darwinists. We have progressed from the Constant Genome, subject only\n to random, localized changes at a more or less constant mutation rate, to\n the Fluid Genome, subject to episodic, massive and non-random\n reorganizations capable of producing new functional architectures. It is\n inevitable that such a profound advance in awareness of genetic\n capabilities will dramatically alter our understanding of the evolutionary\n process. Nonetheless, neo-Darwinist writers like Dawkins continue to ignore\n or trivialize the new knowledge and insist on gradualism as the only path\n for evolutionary change.\n (4) CELLULAR INFORMATION PROCESSING. While it is easy to see how\n advances in our understanding of genome organization and genetic change\n will impact theories of evolutionary processes, there is another\n development in contemporary biology whose relevance to evolution is less\n obvious but more basic. This is the growing realization that cells have\n molecular computing networks which process information about internal\n operations and about the external environment to make decisions controlling\n growth, movement and differentiation. This realization has come, in large\n measure, from detailed genetic analysis of cellular processes and\n multicellular development. The inducible repair systems mentioned above\n provide a relatively simple, well-studied example. Bacterial and yeast\n cells have molecules that monitor the status of the genome and activate\n cellular responses when damaged DNA accumulates. The surveillance molecules\n do this by modifying transcription factors so that appropriate repair\n functions are synthesized. These inducible DNA damage response systems are\n sophisticated and include so-called \"checkpoint\" functions that act to\n arrest cell division until the repair process has been completed. When the\n checkpoints do not function, cell division proceeds before repair is\n completed, and the damaged cells die or produce inviable progeny. One can\n characterize this surveillance/inducible repair/checkpoint system as a\n molecular computation network demonstrating biologically useful properties\n of self-awareness and decision-making.\n There are many other cellular systems that display comparable\n information processing capabilties. It is now common among molecular\n biologists who study the cell cycle to speak of various checkpoints (is DNA\n replication complete? are the chromosomes properly condensed and aligned on\n the metaphase plate?) and decision points (e.g. when to initiate chromosome\n movement and cytokinesis). A recent special issue of ScientificAmerican\n describes beautifully how cancer is now seen as a disease of the molecular\n information processing routines that ensure orderly cell growth and\n behavior in the healthy organism. Aberrant tumor cell growth appears to\n result from at least two kinds of malfunction: (a) the loss of checkpoint\n controls, or (b) the failure of decision-making routines that dictate\n programmed cell death (apoptosis) for cells in inappropriate surroundings.\n During embryonic development, cells make decisions about differentiation\n based on multiple molecular signals picked up from their environment and\n from their neighbors by means of surface receptors. These receptors are\n linked to intercellular molecular cascades called \"signal transduction\n pathways\" which integrate the inputs from the receptors to generate\n appropriate patterns of differential gene expression and morphogenesis of\n specialized cell structures.\n Signal transduction is not limited to multicellular development. We\n are learning that virtually every aspect of cellular function is influenced\n by chemical messages detected, transmitted and interpreted by molecular\n relays. To a remarkable extent, therefore, contemporary biology has become\n a science of sensitivity, inter- and intra-cellular communication, and\n control. Given the enormous complexity of living cells and the need to\n coordinate literally millions of biochemical events, it would be surprising\n if powerful cellular capacities for information processing did not manifest\n themselves. In an important way, biology has returned to questions debated\n during the mechanism-vitalism controversy earlier this century. This time\n around, however, there are two new factors. One is that the techniques of\n molecular and cell biology allow us to examine the detailed operation of\n the hardware responsible for cellular responsiveness and decision-making.\n The second new factor is the existence of computers and information\n networks, physical entities endowed with computational and decision-making\n capabilities. Their existence means that discussing the potential for\n similar activities by living organisms is neither vague nor mystical.\n What significance does an emerging interface between biology and\n information science hold for thinking about evolution? It opens up the\n possibility of addressing scientifically rather than ideologically the\n central issue so hotly contested by fundamentalists on both sides of the\n Creationist-Darwinist debate: Is there any guiding intelligence at work in\n the origin of species displaying exquisite adaptations that range from\n lambda prophage repression and the Krebs cycle through the mitotic\n apparatus and the eye to the immune system, mimicry and social\n organization? Borrowing concepts from information science, new schools of\n evolutionists can begin to rephrase virtually intractable global questions\n in terms amenable to computer modelling and experimentation. We can\n speculate what some of these more manageable questions might be: How can\n molecular control circuits be combined to direct the expression of novel\n traits? Do genomes display characteristic system architectures that allow\n us to predict phenotypic consequences when we rearrange DNA sequence\n components? Are molecular heuristics at work as signal transduction\n networks regulate the action of natural genetic engineering hardware?\n Questions like those above will certainly prove to be naive because\n we are just on the threshold of a new way of thinking about living\n organisms and their variations. Nonetheless, these questions serve to\n illustrate the potential for addressing the deep issues of evolution from a\n radically different scientific perspective. Novel ways of looking at\n longstanding problems have historically been the chief motors of scientific\n progress. However, the potential for new science is hard to find in the\n Creationist-Darwinist debate. Both sides appear to have a common interest\n in presenting a static view of the scientific enterprise. This is to be\n expected from the Creationists, who naturally refuse to recognize science's\n remarkable record of making more and more seemingly miraculous aspects of\n our world comprehensible to our understanding and accessible to our\n technology. But the neo-Darwinian advocates claim to be scientists, and we\n can legitimately expect of them a more open spirit of inquiry. Instead,\n they assume a defensive posture of outraged orthodoxy and assert an\n unassailable claim to truth, which only serves to validate the\n Creationists' criticism that Darwinism has become more of a faith than a\n science.\n A sounder perspective on the history of science would be very\n helpful to all concerned. For example, a parallel has been drawn in your\n columns and elsewhere between criticisms of Darwinian orthodoxy and\n assaults on the Law of Gravity, presenting them as equally deplorable\n examples of anti-science obscurantism. Yet, if truth be told, gravity is\n far from a settled matter. The relativistic Law of Gravity at the end of\n the 20th Century is not the same as the classical Law of Gravity at the end\n of the 19th Century, and discovering how the continuous descriptions of\n general relativity can be integrated into a single theory with the discrete\n accounts of quantum physics is still an active field of research. From a\n scientific point of view, then, the Law of Gravity has quite properly been\n under continuous challenge. Dogmas and taboos may be suitable for religion,\n but they have no place in science. No theory or viewpoint should ever\n become sacrosanct because experience tells us that even the most elegant\n Laws of Nature ultimately succumb to the inexorable progress of scientific\n thinking and technological innovation. The present debate over Darwinism\n will be more productive if it takes place in recognition of the fact that\n scientific advances are made not by canonizing our predecessors but by\n creating intellectual and technical opportunities for our successors.\"\n \n \n \"James A. Shapiro is a bacterial geneticist. For three decades, his research\n has analyzed how mobile genetic elements rearrange the bacterial genome and\n how cellular control circuits regulate the activities of these natural\n genetic engineering systems.

But what I see as your problem is that you cannot, or will not, distinguish between an intelligent response to a stimulus and an automatic mechanical (i.e.,linear) reaction of the physical or chemical kind. That is, you insist upon equating the mindless effects that moving 'bits of stuff' have upon each other, whether they be accidental or mechanical, with the dynamic synergy and goal-directed productivity that marks the internal operations of the interconnected parts of any complex system. Allow me to point out that difference in a very simple way. Your mechanical reactions are determined, while intelligent responses are not. Random reactions are mechanically determined, but no random response is intelligent. Intelligent responses always contain a measure of choice/selection. Mechanical reactions never do.\n None whatsoever.\n \n Computers are complex systems, but they are only dynamic, synergistic, and goal directed because an exogenous intelligence made them that way, and continues to control and direct their activities to its purposes, not their own. When complex systems become autopoietic, that is, when they set their own goals and values and strive to achieve them, then they become intrinsically, i.e., truly, intelligent; not extrinsically 'intelligent' in terms of their aforesaid designers, builders, and operators.\n \n So what do you mean by \"correctly\". In my world, \"correctly\" implies the possibility of an \"incorrect\" response. This does not apply to random responses, where nothing is either 'correct' or 'incorrect', either way, nor does it apply to mechanical reactions, which are determined, so that again there is no 'correct' or 'incorrect', but only what is. Therefore in my world, yes, \"intelligence\" is required to respond correctly to stimuli\". And your toys and computers don't change that one little bit. They are merely artefacts doing what they were made to do, and any 'intelligence' they demonstrate doesn't belong to them.",

Computers are devices for putting symbolic data into relationships which are mined for their information content, i.e., meaning.

   "Then every enzyme is \"intelligent.\" It grabs and changes or doesn't grab and leaves substrate based on the substrate's shape.\n\n \n **\n Ridiculous. Enzymes are only 'bits of stuff'. They are not complex systems. 'Bits of stuff', be they molecules, enzymes, whatever, do whatever they are mechanically determined to do under a given set of conditions, and to do it every time. If a certain enzyme does 'this' under condition \"A\", but does 'that' under condition \"B\", it is still no less mechanical, or more intelligent, than a flag that flaps when the wind blows, but hangs limp when it does not. \"Bits of stuff\" are strictly passive. Only complex systems can be dynamic, rather than passive, determined, and predictable. You'll never see an enzyme faced with condition \"A\" in its \"substrate\", that independently decides it's tired of doing, 'this', every time it encounters \"A\", so this time it does 'that' instead.\n \n Only complex _systems_ can operate 'intelligently', thanks to external intelligent control in the case of machine/mechanical systems, such as storm systems, planetary systems, computers, and so forth, and thanks to internal intelligent control, as in live organisms. Live organismic systems are the only systems with intrinsic, i.e., real, intelligence. Whatever non-organismic systems do, what they do is mechanical.\n There is no intelligence involved in the mechanical, unless and until you ask the cosmological question, that is, how the mechanics of the universe itself, its laws and forces and principles, came into being. Then you are right back to some external source of intelligence operating upon 'bits of stuff', just as you are with computers.",

   "\n Haw!!\n\n \n Quite amusing as that is all you have. \n \n \nSo you are continully claiming. Too bad you never back up that claim with anything but bluster.\n\n \n I'm not trying to prove a insane idea is correct without any means of tests or measuring. The burden of proof is clearly on you, you trying to move it to me, in essence accusing me of failing to do what you initially had the responsbility of is quite decietful and quite stupid if you are caught trying to do it. I'm merely here to pick apart your idiocy. Not prove anything else. \n \n \nYes, it does. It shows that you are wrong about the terms you use. What a silly denial.\n\n \n That's amusing comming from someone who supports the logic that erector sets are intelligent. \n \n \nAs for the \"fundemental\"(sic) basics of science\", you have never, because you simply cannot, demonstrated that what I say about the causal explanation for the historical fact of evolution in any way shape or form contradicts or operates outside of their parameters. You just keep on shouting and stomping your little feet, as if that proves your point.\n\n \n True if we were looking at your fabrication of what evolution is. You just like Super create essentially what is a lie, prove the flaws in it and declare it false. Except that you believe that what you created was actually evolution. People with educations (hence not you) can clearly see what your tatic is. Sure we cannot prove your fabrication of evolution is scientific, considering that it was never meant to be scientific in your attack on it. You're not as bright as you think you are. \n \n \nOTH, I've shown you guys a dozen times, by careful reasoning, why your, 'spontaneous generation', your supposed causal explanation for evolution, is pseudoscientific hokum. But being frightened of the implications for your atheist cosmology, you cling to your materialist superstitions.\n\n \n Hence my point. Evolution is independent on abiogenesis. Anyone who has a education knows this. But this does prove that you are intentionally creating a fabrication of what evolution is and then declaring the real one wrong. No where in evolution is the discussion of where the origin of life nor matter arouse. I see many people stating that it is a part of it but when challenged none of them can prove it. What you are doing is essentially fraud. Does that make you feel good? Secondly, you're claiming that evolution is atheistic, as well as part of comosology. I'd love to see you prove that, but I know you can't even if you were offered a billion dollars to do just that. You're simply trying to do what Marc9000 does, all style no backing. Plus your assertion that evolution is part of a athiest world view consitutes that billions of belivers are therefore Atheists. Marc9000 got hammerd and admitted he was wrong about making such a statement. You apparently did not learn from his idiocy. You're a Christian yes? You just called yourself a atheist by declaring evolution part of the atheistic views. \n \n \nYou say my \"argument\" (which one, I wonder, since I've ogffered several in support of my hypothesis) is \"fundementally\"(sic) \" a failure\". A failure in what sense, you do not say. Nor do you ever try to back up your claim with anything sensible and reasonable.\n\n \n Your argiment of what consitutes intelligence is absurd. Merely because you do not want to take the logic to its conclusion does not make me wrong. It just makes you infantile. Nor have you provided any means of how such a theory would be tested nor measured in a meaningful way. The scientific backing of your ideology is the same as ID: relies upon faith and a complete lack of standards. \n \n \nIt may appear that way to you, since you obviously have no clue as to what is logic and what is not, but I assure you, I spent much time in that post trying to get through to you that, by my 'logic', computers, like all other tools and artefacts, merely reflect the intelligence of their makers, but have none of their own. If you failed to understand that point, that only points to your own intellectual shortcomings. \n\n \n Rich talk for someone who knows litterally squat. I asked a simple question as to what differs a cell from a machine. You didn't answer. Your idea of intelligence resolves purely around taking input and producing decisions. That is quite broad and nothing you've said even hints at what consitutes paramaters. Someone else stated something damning to your argument. Chess programs encounter moves they were not programmed for. Yet they make decisions. That consitutes intelligence under your logic. Therefore machines, even if they are highly advanced, are intelligent which puts a big fat wrench in your biological notions of intelligence. You basic failure to understand such a basic point only points to your own massively, whole encompassing intellectual failures as a person.\n \n \nDuh, yeah. And that is my point, although its obviously way over your head. The computer does nothing but what it is mechanically made to do.\n\n \n You really have no idea what excel does with data do you? Furthermore you haven't actually played with the software on a meaningful level either? \n \n \nWhat it is mechanically made to do is determined by the programme. The programme does nothing but what the programmer makes it do, namely follow paths predetermined by the programmer.\n\n \n And this differs from a cell how? Oh wait it doesn't. You never answered my question about the differences because if you did they would expose just how much of a fraud you are. \n \n \nSo it's really your notionthat \"... that computer is intelligent because it takes input and make decisions.\" We call that 'superstition', these days.\n\n \n So now you change your argument. I see how this works. Refuted, you change clothes. \n \n \nIf you can't see the blatantly obvious difference between the independently dynamic functioning of a living cell and the externally imposed direction of programmer on computer functions then you are simply not bright enough to debate with any longer.\n\n \n A cell reacts in the same kind of programmed way a machine does. Expose it to heat, it moves away. Expose it stimuli and it results in a decision. How is that any different then a machine? The simplest of cells reacts to stimuli. merely because it has coding in the form of genes rather then programming doesn't make it any more intelligent or any less. The independently dynamic functioning of a living cell are hardly different then the independently dynamic functioning of a mechanical or program. If you can't see the blatantly obvious similarities between the input/decision behaviors of cells and constructs then you are simply not bright enough to debate with any longer much less be any worth to anyone.\n \n \nNo, you've done no such thing. It's just that you aren't intelligent enough to realise that you've done no such thing. \n\n \n Why is that you keep trying to insult me and running away from the question that destroys you entirely? \n \n Someone knows he is beaten yet refuses to backdown. \n \n \nThis junk is just too abysmally obtuse for words.\n\n \n No it is too correct for you to admit you are wrong. \n \n \nWhy in the world would I admit to something so ineffably silly? Just because in your poor mind you are convinced that erector sets, despite all my reasoning to the contrary, somehow fit my definition of 'intelligent', does not make it true. What it does do is make you look infantile for making an unfounded assertion in the teeth of reasoned contradiction.\n\n \n You believe in the idiocy on the first page. It makes sense for someone with such low intelligence to if believing something of utter stupidity to accept something equally retarded. Your reasoning argues little more then intelligence is the ability of something to take data and input and result in a decision. That is the fundemental aspect of your argument. Under YOUR logic a erector set is intelligent. There's not much doubt as to why most people here consider you and sport to be somewhat low in the education and IQ levels. \n \n \nHorse manure. You don't even work with my 'argument', whichever one you're supposedly referring to. All you do is is mindlessly assert that my 'argument' claims what you claim it claims, with no demonstration to that effect, whatsoever. I feel like I'm talking to a four year-old, for god's sake!\n\n \n Your entire argument CANNOT BE DEMONSTRATED!\n \n How can we test this intelligence as a form of what you state is it? \n \n \nI'm fully aware of 'argumentum ad absurdum'. I use it on you guys all the time, often with hilarious misunderstandings on your part. But the fact is that you have not presented an 'argumentum ad absurdum'.\n\n \n Funny you say that. You haven't won a argument here yet. Furthermore, simply not wishing to see something doesn't make it go away. Nor does lying about a theory you want to be proven wrong. \n \n \nAs I've just pointed out, all you've done is make a claim about my premise, and then arbitrarily attach an absurd conclusion to it. You make absolutely no reasoned exposition showing how my logical premise, stated honestly, leads inexorably to your absurd conclusion. You merely make an unsubstantiated statement that that is the case. Like any four year-old would do. You understand reasoning and argumentation at that level, and no better. I'm really finding you tiresome.\n\n \n Yet you keep ignoring the one question that destroys you entirely to the core. \n \n If I was really that wrong, you'd answer instead of acting like a coward. \n \n \nYou do love tossing terms around as if you understood them. Your \"adhomein\"(sic) refers to what, exactly? Just how does my pointing out to you that you are the one (see above) who believes that artefacts are intelligent constitute an ad hominem attack on you and not your opinions? You really have no idea what you're talking about. Say, how old are you, really? I'm starting to think maybe twelve.\n\n \n I do find amusing that you rely almost entirely upon fallacies. You make claims of age as if it mattered, you create strawmen, you change the subject, raise the bar and do everything to actually discuss what you make a post about\n \n \nGee, another one who doesn't accept the phenomena of intelligence and intelligence testing, reality be damned.\n\n \n Not in the psuedo science manner you wish it to be.\n \n \n In that case, go back and re-read what I've said about that.\n\n \n Considering how you make exceptions as to what intelligence is to save your argument from its own absurdity, I don't see the point.\n \n \nI've shown how to discriminate mechanical or random behaviours from intelligent, independent and volitional behaviours several times.\n\n \n Does lying to yourself allow you to sleep at night?\n \n \nThe simplest way to do that is to introduce a novel variable, one for which there has been no programming provision, into a teleological process. In terms of biology that simply means taking an organism and introducing a novel stimulus and see if its response is specific to that stimulus and adaptive in terms of that stimulus.\n\n \n Chess programs do this all the time. Are you going to call that non-intelligent? \n Furthermore, that hardly consitutes intelligence, and you would need to know every single stimuli that has ever been done to the organism or the organisms's predecessor's. Even if it was a new stimuli, we'd need to know what every gene does, every gene interaction and everything that a cell has been coded for. As I have stated before you have no real empirical or meaningful way of testing. Your own standards are insane. Furthermore even if we were able to do that it does not prove intelligence. Xp for example has a error log system which tracks and correct new things that happen. While many of the most damaging require human assistance many of the minor are easily taken care of by changes the system does to itself. That qualifies as intelligence but you said machines aren't intelligent. Big problem you need to deal with.\n \n You think you've \"blown [my] argument out of the water\"? Little man, you have delusions of grandeur. As for 'changing the subject', if you can challenge my ideas on a point, it is not 'changing the subject' if I in turn challenge yours by the same standard.\n \n i didn't need to change a single thing to turn it right back around at you. Says much doesn't it? Btw, everyone knows that age claims are fallacies and hardly consistute good arguments. Your idea would be that Bush is smarter then a 15 year old genius merely because he is older. Are you willing to admit such idiocy to add to your already long list of foolishness?\n \n Given just how wrong you are, I wonder why people who HAVE brains, such as Electro bother with you.",

   "\n Haw!!\n\n \n Great response.\n \n \nSo you are continully claiming. Too bad you never back up that claim with anything but bluster.\n\n \n Do you not understand that you are the one with the burden of proof. You have failed to provide any evidence that your ideas need to be taken seriously. Your whole EAM hypothesis, so far, can be disregarded by nothing more complex than Occam's Razor, it being an unnecessarily complicated explanation which also involves a mysterious, intelligent, unfalsifiable force. \n \n \nYes, it does. It shows that you are wrong about the terms you use. What a silly denial.\n \n As for the \"fundemental\"(sic) basics of science\", you have never, because you simply cannot, demonstrated that what I say about the causal explanation for the historical fact of evolution in any way shape or form contradicts or operates outside of their parameters. You just keep on shouting and stomping your little feet, as if that proves your point.\n\n \n Again, you are the one with the burden of proof. You claim that no one has falsified your hypothesis, but the reason for that is that you have given no parameters within which anyone could possibly test your ideas. I think most people here still don't really know what your point is, and not from ignorance, but from your inability to explain yourself without changing tack whenever you are even remotely challenged.\n \n \nOTH, I've shown you guys a dozen times, by careful reasoning, why your, 'spontaneous generation', your supposed causal explanation for evolution, is pseudoscientific hokum. But being frightened of the implications for your atheist cosmology, you cling to your materialist superstitions.\n\n \n No one here, or anywhere, claims that spontaneous generation or abiogenesis is the causal explanation for evolution. No one. OK? It is irrelevant at the present time. Stop bringing it up.\n \n \nYou say my \"argument\" (which one, I wonder, since I've ogffered several in support of my hypothesis) is \"fundementally\"(sic) \" a failure\". A failure in what sense, you do not say. Nor do you ever try to back up your claim with anything sensible and reasonable.\n\n \n The reason your argument is a failure is the same reason that creationists' arguments fail: you make an assertion, 'back it up' with lots of philosophical word games, provide no actual evidence, and then, to cap it all, argue that it must be true because no one can provide any evidence to the contrary, when you can't even suggest what that evidence might be.\n \n \n...by my 'logic', computers, like all other tools and artefacts, merely reflect the intelligence of their makers, but have none of their own.\n\n \n The post you made was simply an assertion that the difference between computers and organisms is that computers don't make decisions but cells do. You provide no evidence, even potential evidence, for this didtinction.\n \n \nDuh, yeah. And that is my point, although its obviously way over your head. The computer does nothing but what it is mechanically made to do. What it is mechanically made to do is determined by the programme. The programme does nothing but what the programmer makes it do, namely follow paths predetermined by the programmer. Those paths are the choices, selections, and decisions made by the programmer in teleological foresight of what he/she wants done with the data. The computer and the programme are the user's tools. They are not independent entities making free decisions. What you claim here is as irrational as primitives claiming that a volcano-god controls the time, force, and direction of its own eruptions. It's pure animism.\n So it's really your notionthat \"... that computer is intelligent because it takes input and make decisions.\" We call that 'superstition', these days.\n\n \n Seriously, mate, everyone here is aware that this guy does not actually think that the computer is intelligent. He is suggesting that by your apparent standards a computer is intelligent. \n Your argument still boils down to asserting that a computer makes no decisions but a cell does, without suggesting any kind of experiment that might show this difference.\n \n \nIf you can't see the blatantly obvious difference between the independently dynamic functioning of a living cell and the externally imposed direction of programmer on computer functions then you are simply not bright enough to debate with any longer.\n\n \n Ditto my previous comment.\n \n \n \n **\n \nNo, you've done no such thing. It's just that you aren't intelligent enough to realise that you've done no such thing.\n\n \n Ditto, plus, given your own explanation of intelligence, the only way it can have been misunderstood so far is that you have not sufficiently explained it. \n \n \nWhy in the world would I admit to something so ineffably silly? Just because in your poor mind you are convinced that erector sets, despite all my reasoning to the contrary, somehow fit my definition of 'intelligent', does not make it true. What it does do is make you look infantile for making an unfounded assertion in the teeth of reasoned contradiction.\n\n \n Ditto, ditto, ditto... \n \n \nHorse manure.

You merely make an unsubstantiated statement that that is the case. Like any four year-old would do. You understand reasoning and argumentation at that level, and no better. I'm really finding you tiresome.\n\n \n Classic case of pot and kettle. From what I've read, no one here has misrepresented your arguments. They have simply pointed out flaws in your reasoning. When this happens, instead of taking it in your stride and accomodating these criticisms in the form of a stronger argument which you have spent a while considering, you just accuse people of misrepresentation but without (and this is the crux of the matter) explaining how you have been misrepresented.\n \n \nYou do love tossing terms around as if you understood them. Your \"adhomein\"(sic) refers to what, exactly? Just how does my pointing out to you that you are the one (see above) who believes that artefacts are intelligent constitute an ad hominem attack on you and not your opinions? You really have no idea what you're talking about. Say, how old are you, really? I'm starting to think maybe twelve.\n\n \n The ad hominem, I believe, referred to \"now you've really lost your trollies\".\n And again, turning this argument back to front and inside out by suggesting that your opponent believes artefacts are intelligent when all he was doing was employing a very efficient ad absurdum, fools and impresses no one. You have yet to argue against this, and simply saying it's too foolish to argue against merely makes your position weaker. If this ad absurdum is so foolish, point out its flaws and strengthen your argument. You have yet to even suggest how a cell's response to stimuli is intelligent. \n \n \nI've shown how to discriminate mechanical or random behaviours from intelligent, independent and volitional behaviours several times. The simplest way to do that is to introduce a novel variable, one for which there has been no programming provision, into a teleological process. In terms of biology that simply means taking an organism and introducing a novel stimulus and see if its response is specific to that stimulus and adaptive in terms of that stimulus.\n\n \n Can you give a single, specific example that could be tested?\n \n Three points of my own:\n \n 1) I have read you EAM thread, so don't direct me to that for answers, it is no more logically or scientifically sound than your outraged bluster on this thread.\n \n 2) Don't use my response here as an excuse to ignore obvious child's far more effective post above. The only reason I posted in this thread is in the hope that if you read yet another comment from someone who has not participated so far, but who has read all your comments, you might spend a while thinking about your argument rather than responding to criticism with things like\n \n \nHAW!!!\n\n \n 3) Your argument is perilously close to that used by creationists, for example as has been suggested already, Behe. From what I've read, your argument boils down to:\n \n * There is no way evolution could happen without intelligence\n * I propose an intelligent force\n \n You provide no possibility for testing either of these assertions.\n \n \n Thanks for taking my points into consideration.",

We can explain why chemicals interact in the way that they do. We can \"describe\" NO+ as having a triple bond, and we can describe NO- as having a double bond, but we can also explain why NO+ has a triple bond and why NO- has a double bond.

Especially since _you_ always appeal to physical forces [as per materialism, above] to explain the psychical properties you possess that themselves allow you to not only observe physical properties in the first place, but also enable you to describe and measure them. And round and round you go, where you'll get off, nobody knows. \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n and 'understanding' is about 'meaning' \n \n ...

Only the interrelationships between data/facts contain significance/meaning.

   "**\n I don't know what you think that you've demonstrated with your toy. But what I see as your problem is that you cannot, or will not, distinguish between an intelligent response to a stimulus and an automatic mechanical (i.e.,linear) reaction of the physical or chemical kind. That is, you insist upon equating the mindless effects that moving 'bits of stuff' have upon each other, whether they be accidental or mechanical, with the dynamic synergy and goal-directed productivity that marks the internal operations of the interconnected parts of any complex system. Allow me to point out that difference in a very simple way. Your mechanical reactions are determined, while intelligent responses are not. Random reactions are mechanically determined, but no random response is intelligent. Intelligent responses always contain a measure of choice/selection. Mechanical reactions never do.\n None whatsoever.\n\n Oof. You appear to be arguing that mechanical interactions are not intelligent and that cells are intelligent.\n Here's a hint: the chemical reactions of cells can be explained in terms of mechanical interactions.\n \nLiving with the Fluid Genome\n By Mae-Wan Ho\n \n The biotech empire is fast collapsing and for good scientific reasons. It has got the science wrong. Read this riveting inside-story of the fluid genome, long suppressed by the corporate establishment because it is bad for business, written by a scientist who has been warning that genetic engineering is both dangerous and futile for over a decade\n \n Be sure to read the whole page, including reviews and quotes at the bottom. This will be my next purchase.\n \n http://www.i-sis.org.uk/fluidGenome.php\n \n \n \"This [neo-Darwinian] theory is very comforting for those who derive the most benefit from the status quo, and they are responsible for a huge 'Darwin industry' dedicated to 'explaining' why this is the best of all possible worlds, which is masquerading as mainstream science.\"\n \n \"Genes and genomes are part and parcel of the entire physiological system that responds to the environment in myriad non-random, repeatable ways....It is ironic that Lamarckian principles should now be found to be operating at the molecular level.\"\n \n oh, my dear heart is singing!\n\n Another quote from the page:One of the most persistent dogmas in western science is genetic determinism, the belief that our genetic makeup, or our birth, ultimately determines who and what we are.\n \n Genetic determinism was the guiding principle in the development of the modern science of genetics, which in turn gave rise to the eugenics movement that lasted at least until the mid 1970s in the United States and Europe. Not only were 'inferior races' persecuted, 'inferior' and 'disabled' individuals were also considered 'unfit' and targeted for elimination.\n \n Eugenics is surfacing again as human 'genomic' science, spawned by the sequencing of the human and other genomes, is promising to identify all the 'bad' genes that cause diseases and disabilities, so they could be eliminated at conception or before birth, while the 'good' genes would be promulgated, and better yet, used for the 'genetic enhancement' of anyone who can pay for the privilege. This time round, eugenics will not be sanctioned by the state. It will be up to the 'global market' to decide. The poor will become a genetic 'underclass'. Social inequality will be redefined as, and transformed into genetic inequality.\n \n Fortunately, science as knowledge of nature is never just subject to our arbitrary whim and prejudice. We can delude ourselves, but only for so long. Nature has a way of fighting back, of puncturing our illusions.\n \n The story of the 'fluid genome' tells how geneticists came face to face with scientific findings that completely undercut the old genetic determinist paradigm. It makes nonsense of all the eugenicist claims and promises, and exposes the futility as well as the hazards of genetic engineering for the health of human beings and the entire life-supporting system that's our planet.\n \n Read this book to find out what it means to be liberated from the genetic determinist myth and to be living with the fluid genome.Basically, this is saying that the \"nature vs. nurture\" debate was nonexistent until Dr. Mae-Wan Ho came along. It assumes that biologists believe that organisms are controlled by their genes and that their experiences have no effect on them.\n Also, I notice that it portrays biologists as racists, ignoring the fact that biology has emphasized the fact that all humans are basically equal (unlike the previous belief that black people were only 3/5 human).\n \n**\n What's to \"demonstrate\"? Do you deny the reality of wind and rain, rocks and trees? Do you deny their physical properties? No. So where do you get off denying the life, and its psychical properties of intelligence, volition, emotion, motivation, imagination, awareness, identity, and on and on. They demonstrably exist, and only a fool would deny that and ask for a 'demonstration'.\n\n In that case, you probably won't like this article. Consider this quote in particular:In general, people rarely think about their selves but act as if such entities must exist. \"The normal mark of the self in action is that we have very little experience of it,\" Frith says.\n \n It is true. Think about it before trying to write a rebuttal. Hopefully you will realize that in most situations, even when you feel emotions, you are not necessarily thinking about your \"self;\" you are thinking about what is happening around you and how to respond to it. You automatically attribute actions that you take to your sense of self, but only if you stop to think about it.\n \n So what is the point? The point is that awareness and identity are not nearly as concrete as you think and that volition takes the form of your brain analyzing a situation and responding to it (like a chess-playing computer, but more complicated).",

Computers can respond only to the stimuli that their maker predetermines that they shall, (i.e., must), respond to--they have no liberty of their own to decide what they will input (or download, if you prefer), or what part of that input they will respond to, or in what manner they will respond to that input. The designer/programmer does that before the machine is even plugged in.\n \n This is not the case with live biosystems. Whereas machines and other tools are allopatric systems, that is, they operate for the purpose of producing a product (say, processed data) that serves an external purpose, cells and the communities of cells we call organisms are autopoietic--that is, they are self-generated, self-sustaining, their product is for themselves and by and large is themselves, and most importantly, they have some independence in deciding what they will input, what they will not input, how they will respond to what they do input.

Even an internal combustion engine is more than a pile of sparkplugs, pistons and so forth. It is the ordering of the parts, not the parts themselves, that make the system. And in biosytems, there's a lot more than mere organization and structuring--there's also self-control.

   "I do not ignore just ignorant XXX-kissing jibes and lame unsupported opinions, I also ignore people who repeatedly and dishonestly distort my message in any way they can, and also people who bore me. And I have every right to do so.\n\n \n Yet that does not make you right nor the ignored wrong.\n \n Futhermore, as others have said only you think that others have distorted your argument. Your lack of paramaters much less viable measuring structure shows that (which you clearly ignored the criticism of). Furthermore as you have been directly challenged you fail to support your claims on evolution as well as directly ignoring direct challenges to back them up. I sent you a link to a thread asking you to do just that. You have failed do even post.\n \n Sure you have right to do what you want, but when it's ignoring how others have refuted you it doesn't make you right, just infantile. \n \n \n I consider evolution to be a fact, and facts are neither theistic nor atheistic.\n\n \n Yet you declared without proof, without argument, without evidence that evolution is part of the atheistic view. Do I need to quote you or are you going to contiune lying? \n \n \nI do consider the proposed RMNS explanation for evolution to be atheistic, because it inherently dismisses any rational power from any part of life's origins and evolution, substituting random chance, aka, spontaneous generation,\n\n \n My point again here is proven. You have obviously distorted even fabricated your own version of evolution. Abiogenesis is not a part of evolution. I asked you to prove it was. You have completely and utterly failed to do so. Simply saying that it is a part does not make it so. Failing like a coward to meet challenges to prove it is even worse. Evolution does not deal with the origin of life. It never has. I'm calling you a giant liar for saying it does. And I'm going to keep calling you a coward if you refuse to support your claim that abiogenesis = evolution. \n \n \nor that power, coupled to the regularities of this universe which it also inherently attributes to spontaneous generation, as per its materialist/atheist metaphysical roots. Abiogenesis is simply part and parcel of the atheistic, 'spontaneous generation', materialist cosmology.\n\n \n Except that none of that is part of evolution. Which you apparently don't understand. Besides, if spontaneous generation is absurd, so is the idea of a ever existing intelligence.\n \n \nAs for the Big Bang, I believe that that is truly the beginning of the material universe, meaning that the material universe did not exist before or until the 'Big Bang', whatever you make of that. For surwe it was not another case of your supposed, \"spontaneous generation\".\n\n \n Have you even heard of the eternity circuit? For all your talk you fail to understand even the most basic issues in dealing with what you allegedly claim to know. \n \n \nNext time, take your own advice and check your facts before putting your mouth in gear.\n\n \n Considering how you have failed to address two damning posts aganist you, and you're obviously ignoring challenges to defend your arguments you are infantile.",
