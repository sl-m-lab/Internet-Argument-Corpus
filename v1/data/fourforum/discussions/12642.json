   "From the article:\n \n \nMcKinney and his defense team were silent on the new information, because his sentencing agreement forbids them from ever discussing the case, or profiting from it.\n\n The D.A. is a real ##### for not slapping them down hard for that interview they did violating the terms of their GUILTY plea agreement.\n \n Furthermore:\n \nAccording to the detectives, Henderson's testimony also would have resolved the most contested issue of the case: that he and McKinney initially approached Shepard and posed as gays to lure him out of the Fireside Lounge to rob him.\n Henderson provided a detailed account of that plan. The killers identified Shepard as a lonely homosexual, an easy mark, and retreated to the bathroom to hatch their plot.\n\n This clearly establishes it as a hate crime.\n CHOOSING your victim because he is gay / straight / black / white / etc MAKES it a hate crime.\n \n It doesn't matter if you chose to KILL him because he was gay, or ROB him because he was gay and later killed him. The CHOOSING BECAUSE HE WAS GAY makes it a hate crime.\n \n In the end, some people are choosing to listen to the word of meth-head killers. These people are choosing to listen to the word of people who had REPEATEDLY CONTRADICTED THEMSELVES (and been contradicted by others) prior to the trial, and during the trial.\n \n And in the end, how many \"robberies\" have you heard of where they beat the guy to death and leave him outside, tied to a fence like a scarecrow out in the middle of nowhere, with a cracked skull to die?\n Obviously, there was a LOT MORE behind this than just a robbery...",
