   "Hi. My user name is Lilac Angel and I am new to this forum. \n \n I am so disgusted with our government about this war. I believe it is insane and could possibly lead us into WW III.\n \n I also believe this war is all about greed and control of the oil. I do not feel that we should be sacrificing our military boy's life because of oil.\n \n I do not like Bush at all. I feel he is a trigger happy cowboy that is HELL-bent on lining his pockets, and the pockets of his plutocratic partners even more with oil.\n \n American gov seems to believe in the \"do as I say, not as I do\" rule. \n \n I am to the point of disliking America as much as more than half the world does now. \n \n Thanks for letting me unload.\n \n Lilac",

Our world does depend on oil...so much so that according to people that has researched fossil fuels, we have aprox 30 to 50 years left of it. A book called \"The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight\" written by Thom Hartmann, will give you an understanding of this. Here are 2 web sites that explains some about his understandings.\n \n http://www.wisdomschool.com/home-lh.shtml\n http://www.lauralee.com/hartmann.htm\n \n \n <<<\"Let me ask you, will you kill for food, will you kill to keep freezing cold out of the house, will you kill for the clothes on your back, will you kill for your way of life? I would and I would kill Saddam with my barehands if he tried to take any of these things away from me.\"<<<\n \n Kill what? Humans or animals? Yes, I will kill animals for food. I am a Montana-born farm girl and hunter. I know how to survive off the land.\n \n Will I kill humans to eat...No. I believe the way for humans to survive the trials and tribulations are to come together and work together...not kill each other. When you kill others, sooner or later, you are on someone's list to be killed. What goes around, comes around.\n \n <<<\"So when you shout the slogan \"no blood for oil\". Does that mean you are willing to go hungry for your idealism? \n \n \n Answered above. Do I believe oil is as valuable as human life?...No where near. We can survive without oil. There are other alternative fuel sources. We do not need to kill for oil, we just need to use the other sources that do not pollute the very air that we breathe. (We do need air to survive).\n \n When Henry Ford invented the automobile, he had other sources in mind for fuel...vegetable fuel/hemp fuel.\n \n \"Ford recognized the utility of the hemp plant. He constructed a car of resin stiffened hemp fiber, and even ran the car on ethanol made from hemp. Ford knew that hemp could produce vast economic resources if widely cultivated.\"\n \n Complete story at... http://www.artistictreasure.com/learnmorecleanair.html\n \n Hemp/vegetable fuel does NOT pollute the air. The reason why hemp has not been used is because it damages the pocketbooks of the plutocrates (those that buy the favors of the gov), including the Bushes, who made their riches on oil. That is why it was prohibited in 1937...all because of greed.\n \n Greed and control is about to destroy this one-time great nation.\n Any time decisions are based on greed, they fail, sooner or later. And with an oil-man in leadership, it will be sooner than you think.\n \n Btw, thanks for giving me a respectful rebuttal. I have been on other forums that don't use anything but personal attacks against those that disagree.\n \n I am still learning how to use this forum, so please be patient if I don't do it correctly.\n \n Lilac Angel",

It will line his pockets even more.\n \n Think about it. \n \n I do think about this war on a daily bases. One cannot excape it. It fills our media.

Especially if he knows that his country and interest are in danger of being overtaken by a country that continues to build weapons of mass destruction. Would you disarm privately if you were told to?

Clinton had no problems going everywhere he left us, and he almost went into Iraq too. I supported those actions. \n \n The world is starting to dislike Bush more and more everyday. He is not a good leader. He believes the way to stop violence is with violence. Here is a blunt, but wise quote for you...\"fighting a war to gain peace is like screwing to become a virgin\".\n \n As the only superpower in this world, I feel America has an obligation to spread democracy throughout the world so that everyone can enjoy the freedoms we enjoy and so that everyone has the right to elect their governments. \n \n First, we are not the ONLY superFORCE. (there is a big difference between power and force). China, who is against us attacking Iraq, also has enough WMD to destroy the biggest part of the world, just like the USA.\n \n Second, Even if we do have the biggest BRAWN, it does not mean we are the most intelligent. Actually, we are far from it. We can't even take care of our own country and all the \"dirt\" we have in it. For us to lead the world is like the blind leading the blind...right over a cliff.\n \n See my post on the UN and Peace Protestors: Biggest Killers of All. \n \n \n I glanced at it but my mind and soul rejects propaganda. If we didn't protest against the injustices of our government, we would be nothing more than puppets being ruled by a government that is suppost to be working for us. We the People are the governed and America was built to be led by the governed, not the government.

   " So you think we should just sit around and wait to get killed instead of intercepting threats before they get us killed. \n \n As I have said before, it is insanity to kill threats. If all humans were allowed to kill who they feel is a threat, there would not be much left of the human race.\n \n We all \"sit around\" and wait for death every day. Death is a part of life. We all have to face it sooner or later. I choose not to live in fear of it coming.\n \n \n  I think enough American blood has been shed.\n \n Do you feel American blood is the only blood that counts? That is a selfish attitude, isn't it? \n \n You really should look at the big picture. We all live on one planet. We are all members of the human race. Blood shed in the countries that we have bombed throughout history is no less valuable than American blood. Empathy, putting yourself in other people's shoes, is good practice in understanding other countries that say they are tired of American domination shedding the blood of their loved ones? If you can't empathize with them, then look at the reality of it. What goes around comes around. And if we continue to control others by force, alot more American blood will be shed. And as much as I hate to say this...we will have it coming. We are nothing but big bullies, beating up on the little guys and controlling them by force.\n \n \n \n  And what do you think would happen if we just destroyed all of our WMD right now.\n \n Looking at the big picture again...if all countries that shared this earth, destroyed and stop building WMD...sounds pretty damn good to me. At least, the insanity of WMD would alleviate alot of terror in the world. Just as Einstein said...\"I don't know what WW III will be fought with, but I know that WW IV will be fought with sticks and stones\".\n \n \n They (speaking about the threats of the white supremists,etc,) are under constant watch by the government.\n \n This answer is not based on logic. If \"threats\" are under constant watch, why did antrax get spead around right after 9/11? Why did\n the Oklahoma bombing happen in the first place? You're deluding yourself if you think our \"homeland terrorist threats\" can be stopped \"because they are under constant watch\".\n \n Yea, we silenced him for good, now didn't we. Who knows how many people were in on that. We will never find out now. \n \n Yeah we really screwed up there, thats why they are still blowing up buildings.\n \n You said \"they\", so that would means you feel there were more involved. And how do you know \"they\" are not planning their next move?\n \n  And how exactly are we wrong here(if you are saying that)? \n \n WE are the agressors. WE are the ones planning the attack on a country that has not attacked us. WE are the ones that continue to build weapons of mass destruction. WE are the ones that are trying to take other countries BY FORCE...going against the very ideals this country was built on...the freedom to choose your own way of life!!!\n \n \n  Sadam has exterminated how many innocent people? \n \n And how many innocent lives all over the world and IN OUR OWN COUNTRY have we exterminated...all in the name of the \"we are right and you are wrong\"? Read up on the drug war. Innocent people that have the right to do what ever they want to their own bodies...that they own, not harming anyone else, are killed because the gov says they can't grow and partake in a little natural plant matter. It is insanity how many are killed in America because of this. Who is our gov to tell other countries they can't kill, when our gov is one of the biggest offenders of this! We really should clean up the dirt in our own back yard before we qualify ourselves as leaders and controllers of the world.\n \n Exactly how far is too far in this case, he has already broken the cease fire agreement, so we already have a good enough cause to go in. \n \n And the American gov has broken their own \"peace treaty\" the Declaration of Independence, with their own citizens...But you feel that is okay, eh? Again, the \"do as I say, not as I do\" rule is going to backfire on us. If you used a little common sense, you would see that when a big bully forces his will on others, sooner or later that big bully is going to be taken out.\n \n Have you stocked up on your \"duct tape and plastic\"? Be prepared to kiss your friends and family goodbye, should we decide to attack. The possibility of more and more terrorism will be far more likely in America. Is that what it is going to take before some of you wake up to what violence creates?\n \n Violence begats violence! That is a universial truth!\n \n Lilac Angel",

   "Peace without a complete military victory is unheard of. \n \n You are right there. It is unheard of. That is because peace has never been given a chance. We have to many trigger happy killers in our leadership throughout history that believes the only way to resolve a problem is by killing the problem.\n \n Look at WW1 when we did not go all the way and finish them off. We had to come back and do it all over again in WW2. If we had just let Japan get off easy I am quite sure they would have been back but we didnt, we did it right by destroying their ability to threaten us. \n \n America is the biggest threat of all. As soon as we are done with the little country of Iraq, we will be heading for our next victim. How many countries are ready to take out the threat of the American domination? For the life of me, I cannot figure out how some of you people feel it is okay for America to threaten the lives of other countries, but they can't threaten us. Why is it that some of you can't see that? That is as visable as the nose on your face, but yet you can't see it!

Perhaps we should study history a little more closely to see what has always worked before, and what has not. \n \n What has always worked? Tell me, what war has ever brought lasting peace to this earth? In my half of a century on this earth, I have never seen any lasting peace...nor have I read about it in history. Since my older brother (that I never got the chance to meet) was killed in the Korean war to the present day...all I can ever remember is the men going off to war in other countries, the women and children they leave behind shedding tear after tear, never to see them again. \n \n Sharing tears with my 19 year old daughter-in-law as we hugged my Son goodbye as he prepares for war. And then to have her ask me...\"Why is our world so war happy? Why has it always been this way? Women all over the world are always kissing their loved ones goodbye as they go off to war. Will humans ever get to feel what peace is all about?\"\n \n \n  Like Broker pointed out, appeasment does not bring peace, it brings blood and a lot of it. \n \n Tell me, what does bring peace because history has told us over and over that war only brings a temporary peace...usually not lasting more than a year. And war also brings alot of spilled blood. \n \n \n I do not believe that we should just let Sadam slide for the sake of short term peace. To achieve lasting peace and security of our nation we need to do what we have always done, what has always worked, eliminate our enemies capability to do us harm.  \n \n What planet do you live on because I know you are not talking about earth.

I understand taking out one man to save a million lives, but I do not understand killing a million lives off to take out one man (and a few of his gang members).\n \n I believe any and all leaders, of any and all countries, that believes in killing to resolve a problem, should be taken out of leadership.

I have faith (not much though) in the human race being able to rise above our barbaric killing. \n \n We could begin by using the ideals in the Declaration of Independence...\"...that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, (allowing it's people to the right to Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness) it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new Governments...\"\n \n We need to alter or abolish our present governments. (I say fire them all and begin again!) They are not working for the people any more. They are working for the rich and powerful only. (Plutocrates).\n \n We the People all over the world still out number the governments. We, the governed have that power...we are just to chickensh*t to stand up to them because they are the ones with all the money. \"When the government fears the people, there is Liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.\"\n \n That is our first step...be insightful enough to SEE the injustices the gov does to the people that pay them their riches by our hard labor; be brave enough to make a change...and then move on it.\n \"Government is best which governs the least, because it's people disciplines themselves.\" (T.

If all humans were allowed to kill who they feel is a threat, there would not be much left of the human race. \n \n As I have said before why should we sit and wait, how about this, if you do not think it is a good idea to stop threats before they kill and that it is bad to kill others to save ourselves then here is what I say, it is ok if you or a member of your family dies becuase we did not stop it before it got here, but anyone else would be unacceptable, fair enough?\n \n Do you feel American blood is the only blood that counts?

And other countries sees the US as a bigger threat to world peace because we control by force, which also labels the US as \"bad people\"...a big-brawned-bully that will need to be \"taken out\".\n \n And with power-hungry men running the biggest majority of our world, you can bet there are going to be a few \"smaller guys\" that will gang up to try and take the big bully out. That is an egotistical male thing that has been around since whales walked the earth. :D\n \n You say we should destroy our WMD, if we were to do that, what would keep other nations from destroying us.\n \n When I say WE, I see the big picture...meaning...we the people of the world. NO ONE on this earth should build WMD. They endanger the human race when enough controlling men have their fingers on the buttons.\n \n Sadam is like a tumor, the treatment will hurt, but going with out it will kill you.\n \n By cutting the tumor off your XXX, does not mean you've cured the cancer.\n \n I see the human race as a fungus to this earth. We have raped and polluted the earth to the point that our air is becoming dangerous to breath; much of our water is not fit to drink; Our soil is polluted with chemicals that grow our vegetables; etc. The rich control the poor by force.\n \n Taking out one controlling man (tumor) is not going to cure the dis-ease.\n \n  Back from the LSD trip yet, WAKE UP! \n \n I will ignore the first part of your false stupidity and respond to the capital part. I HAVE AWAKENED! That is why I see the world as ONE! That is why I see the world 180 degrees different than you. What you see is \"normal\" because 85 % of the world is still sleeping.\n \n  The world will not join together in peace, that idea is by far the dumbest thing I have ever heard! IT IS NOT POSSIBLE!\n \n What you see as dumb, I see as the only way the human race will survive.\n \n And what you see as impossible is only because the sleeping 85 percent of you THINK that.\n \n The AWAKENED ONES see NO-THING as impossible. We understand that the Power of Love (God) has the ability to move mountains..if enough people wake up to the Energy of It.\n \n \n  As I have said before why should we sit and wait, how about this, if you do not think it is a good idea to stop threats before they kill and that it is bad to kill others to save ourselves then here is what I say, it is ok if you or a member of your family dies becuase we did not stop it before it got here, but anyone else would be unacceptable, fair enough?\n \n No, actually that isn't fair enough. How about you and the rest of \"the armchair warriors\" pry your asses off the computer chairs and go take your place out on the front lines...replace the boys that know this war is unjust. And you personally can take my Son's place in war...now that would be fair.\n \n I am willing to bet we are leading the world into WW III, and it is a bet I would love to lose!\n \n \n I would like to respond more to the posts, but my time is limited on here. I just wanted to respond to this to let you know that I am still around...and still willing to show some of you how the more mature, weaker-brawned sex, and the Awakened Ones see the world.\n \n Lilac Angel",

Bush and his gang are HELL-bent on trying to resolve violence with violence. And that is a shame because I believe we will all begin to reap what Bush is now sowing. I don't have any trust in our gov, but I do have a lot of faith in our military doing their job they are commanded to do quickly. And of course, Bush doesn't deserve any credit for that, even if he is commander in chief. They were trained before he stole office.\n \n All many of us can do now is pray for the least amount killed.

   "If we had \"obviously destroyed\" the threats against us, then tell me, why did 9/11, the USS Cole, etc. happen in the first place? \n \n 9/11, the USS Cole etc. were attacks from a different enemy in a different kind of war, a war which we have to win. 9/11, the USS Cole, the Embassy bombings etc. were all the offensive actions we needed to justify our defensive actions now. If we do not fight back, our way of life will not survive.\n \n So far we are still here, but that is not a given that we will remain here.  \n \n That is true, but it is a given that if we dont defend ourselves in this war we will not remain here, I would rather take our only chance at surviving than to try to go for peace when others have already started attacking us, which will lead to our destruction.\n \n Yes I do believe Saddam should be removed. But I feel his own people should take care of him. If they wanted our help, they would have asked for it.  \n \n The INC has been asking for help since they had to flee thier country, everyone who has left Iraq has said that everyone there wants him gone but they cant do it as he has strong control of the military there. The Kurds to the North have been asking for our help.\n \n Now why would you want to discredit your own character by using personal attacks?  \n \n That was not intended to be a personal attack, I thought it was funny. Since we can not here to tone of our voices I will do things like this <sarcasm< <joke< ect.\n \n The key word there is YET. And yes, that MIGHT eliminate Saddam. It didn't eliminate bin Laden or Saddam before, so there is still the possibility that it won't again. \n \n Last time we did not go to eliminate Sadam and we are just now trying to eliminate bin Laden, it will take time to get him, it is not going to happen over night, we have already caught his head guy and alot of his top people. We are still trying to destroy his ability to threaten society but it will take time.\n \n Thanks for that reminder but I don't believe that I ever excluded myself from the human race.  \n \n Just checking. ;) \n before I forget...\n \n And how many countries are wanting to eliminate our controlling gov? \n \n Probably many who can know? China is in no place to criticize us, need I boil XYOU's blood anymore with mentioning Tibet(go to the open forum if you havent, its getting interesting)? France, hehe I dont need to mention France. Who knows who else, but, are these people also recieving humanitarian aide from our \"controlling govt\" and if they are not have they recieved help from us before, they are bitting the hand that feeds them.\n \n Instead of resorting to your personal attacks again and ridiculing the info, try educating yourself about it. You can begin by reading \"The Power of Now\" by Eckhart Tolle and \"Power vs. Force\" by David R. Hawkins, MD, Ph.D. \n \n Perhaps I read I little bit too much into your statement, I will try to avoid such things in the future. \n \n After reading this, I actually felt a little guilt. I have often wished that my Son was still ignorant to the lies of the American gov. By not trusting the decisions of his commander, I have wondered how it will affect him (and the others that don't believe the gov is telling them the truth) during war-time. \n \n They will still follow orders, dont worry about that, your son is a hero among heros and will do his job. And dont feel guilty, you are not the first, I forgot which thread but I do remember it started to turn into a gay rights debate. I think it was under the \"UN why it means nothing thread\" I will bring it back up.\n \n I do have complete confidence in my Son's ability to perform his job well, but I wonder how much damage it will do to his/their soul? Will they be affected like many of the Viet Nam Veterans were? \n \n I doubt it, moral is alot higher now then what it was then. And we are all volunteers, we were not put in against our will. And one very different aspect is that people now see the uselessness in blaming soldiers for wars, now they blame the politicians that send them off and support the troops (I hope most do) and that is a big difference.\n \n \"Older men declare war. But it is the youth that must fight and die.\" Herbert Hoover 1944. \n \n That is true, but now \"Older men\" are the ones held responcible for wars they start, now more than ever politics is a key player so they will (if they want to get re-elected) try to avoid un-neccessary wars but this war is neccessary to save American blood and as any U.S. soldier would agree to, that is worth fighting for.",

Ottaway\n Washington Post Staff Writers\n Sunday, September 15, 2002; Page A01 \n \n A U.S.-led ouster of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein could open a bonanza for American oil companies long banished from Iraq, scuttling oil deals between Baghdad and Russia, France and other countries, and reshuffling world petroleum markets, according to industry officials and leaders of the Iraqi opposition.\n \n Although senior Bush administration officials say they have not begun to focus on the issues involving oil and Iraq, American and foreign oil companies have already begun maneuvering for a stake in the country's huge proven reserves of 112 billion barrels of crude oil, the largest in the world outside Saudi Arabia.\n \n The importance of Iraq's oil has made it potentially one of the administration's biggest bargaining chips in negotiations to win backing from the U.N. Security Council and Western allies for President Bush's call for tough international action against Hussein. All five permanent members of the Security Council -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -- have international oil companies with major stakes in a change of leadership in Baghdad.\n \n \"It's pretty straightforward,\" said former CIA director R. James Woolsey, who has been one of the leading advocates of forcing Hussein from power. \"France and Russia have oil companies and interests in Iraq. They should be told that if they are of assistance in moving Iraq toward decent government, we'll do the best we can to ensure that the new government and American companies work closely with them.\"\n \n But he added: \"If they throw in their lot with Saddam, it will be difficult to the point of impossible to persuade the new Iraqi government to work with them.\"\n \n Indeed, the mere prospect of a new Iraqi government has fanned concerns by non-American oil companies that they will be excluded by the United States, which almost certainly would be the dominant foreign power in Iraq in the aftermath of Hussein's fall. Representatives of many foreign oil concerns have been meeting with leaders of the Iraqi opposition to make their case for a future stake and to sound them out about their intentions.\n \n Since the Persian Gulf War in 1991, companies from more than a dozen nations, including France, Russia, China, India, Italy, Vietnam and Algeria, have either reached or sought to reach agreements in principle to develop Iraqi oil fields, refurbish existing facilities or explore undeveloped tracts. Most of the deals are on hold until the lifting of U.N. sanctions.\n \n But Iraqi opposition officials made clear in interviews last week that they will not be bound by any of the deals.\n \n \"We will review all these agreements, definitely,\" said Faisal Qaragholi, a petroleum engineer who directs the London office of the Iraqi National Congress (INC), an umbrella organization of opposition groups that is backed by the United States. \"Our oil policies should be decided by a government in Iraq elected by the people.\"\n \n Ahmed Chalabi, the INC leader, went even further, saying he favored the creation of a U.S.-led consortium to develop Iraq's oil fields, which have deteriorated under more than a decade of sanctions. \"American companies will have a big shot at Iraqi oil,\" Chalabi said.\n \n The INC, however, said it has not taken a formal position on the structure of Iraq's oil industry in event of a change of leadership.\n \n While the Bush administration's campaign against Hussein is presenting vast possibilities for multinational oil giants, it poses major risks and uncertainties for the global oil market, according to industry analysts.\n \n Access to Iraqi oil and profits will depend on the nature and intentions of a new government. Whether Iraq remains a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, for example, or seeks an independent role, free of the OPEC cartel's quotas, will have an impact on oil prices and the flow of investments to competitors such as Russia, Venezuela and Angola.\n \n While Russian oil companies such as Lukoil have a major financial interest in developing Iraqi fields, the low prices that could result from a flood of Iraqi oil into world markets could set back Russian government efforts to attract foreign investment in its untapped domestic fields. That is because low world oil prices could make costly ventures to unlock Siberia's oil treasures far less appealing.\n \n Bush and Vice President Cheney have worked in the oil business and have long-standing ties to the industry. But despite the buzz about the future of Iraqi oil among oil companies, the administration, preoccupied with military planning and making the case about Hussein's potential threat, has yet to take up the issue in a substantive way, according to U.S. officials. \n \n The Future of Iraq Group, a task force set up at the State Department, does not have oil on its list of issues, a department spokesman said last week. An official with the National Security Council declined to say whether oil had been discussed during consultations on Iraq that Bush has had over the past several weeks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Western leaders.\n \n On Friday, a State Department delegation concluded a three-day visit to Moscow in connection with Iraq. In early October, U.S. and Russian officials are to hold an energy summit in Houston, at which more than 100 Russian and American energy companies are expected.\n \n Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.) said Bush is keenly aware of Russia's economic interests in Iraq, stemming from a $7 billion to $8 billion debt that Iraq ran up with Moscow before the Gulf War. Weldon, who has cultivated close ties to Putin and Russian parliamentarians, said he believed the Russian leader will support U.S. action in Iraq if he can get private assurances from Bush that Russia \"will be made whole\" financially.\n \n Officials of the Iraqi National Congress said last week that the INC's Washington director, Entifadh K. Qanbar, met with Russian Embassy officials here last month and urged Moscow to begin a dialogue with opponents of Hussein's government.\n \n But even with such groundwork, the chances of a tidy transition in the oil sector appear highly problematic. Rival ethnic groups in Iraq's north are already squabbling over the the giant Kirkuk oil field, which Arabs, Kurds and minority Turkmen tribesmen are eyeing in the event of Hussein's fall.\n \n Although the volumes have dwindled in recent months, the United States was importing nearly 1 million barrels of Iraqi oil a day at the start of the year. Even so, American oil companies have been banished from direct involvement in Iraq since the late 1980s, when relations soured between Washington and Baghdad.\n \n Hussein in the 1990s turned to non-American companies to repair fields damaged in the Gulf War and Iraq's earlier war against Iran, and to tap undeveloped reserves, but U.S. government studies say the results have been disappointing.\n \n While Russia's Lukoil negotiated a $4 billion deal in 1997 to develop the 15-billion-barrel West Qurna field in southern Iraq, Lukoil had not commenced work because of U.N. sanctions. Iraq has threatened to void the agreement unless work began immediately.\n \n Last October, the Russian oil services company Slavneft reportedly signed a $52 million service contract to drill at the Tuba field, also in southern Iraq. A proposed $40 billion Iraqi-Russian economic agreement also reportedly includes opportunities for Russian companies to explore for oil in Iraq's western desert.\n \n The French company Total Fina Elf has negotiated for rights to develop the huge Majnoon field, near the Iranian border, which may contain up to 30 billion barrels of oil. But in July 2001, Iraq announced it would no longer give French firms priority in the award of such contracts because of its decision to abide by the sanctions.\n \n Officials of several major firms said they were taking care to avoiding playing any role in the debate in Washington over how to proceed on Iraq. \"There's no real upside for American oil companies to take a very aggressive stance at this stage. There'll be plenty of time in the future,\" said James Lucier, an oil analyst with Prudential Securities.\n \n But with the end of sanctions that likely would come with Hussein's ouster, companies such as ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco would almost assuredly play a role, industry officials said. \"There's not an oil company out there that wouldn't be interested in Iraq,\" one analyst said.\n \n Staff writer Ken Bredemeier contributed to this report.\n \n The evidence is clear. This proves this war is for oil.\n \n Read em and weep.",
