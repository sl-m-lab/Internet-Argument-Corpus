   "I have never received an actual explanation for the doctrine of eternal damnation from anyone I've asked. It is something I struggled with before turning to Atheism, something I tried desperately to rationalize, and was one of the main points that LED to me becoming Atheist\n \n Many Christians claim that their God is omnipotent/omniscient. They claim that their God is a god of compassion, love, and mercy. Yet, with all of this, they claim that God punishes all people who do not accept Jesus as their savior with eternal torment in Hell, i.e. the vast majority of mankind numbering into the billions. \n \n What possible compassionate purpose can infinite torture have? The punishment doesn't even serve a remedial purpose because the tormented one is not allowed to repent. It's only conceivable purpose (to me at least) is sadism. \n \n How is this not evil?\n \n This thread is especially so I can her the thoughts of Christians on this and how they rationalize it, but anyone can feel free to chime in with observations, etc.",

   "I'm not going to debate this with you but here is one explanation of the Doctrine of Hell from the Protestant perspective. Specifically the Calvinist perspective. And this isn't to say that I am a Calvinist either so don't make any assumptions. I read it though and agreed with it although I would have added some information it doesn't such as Hell was created for the devil and his angels, not man. We go there by choice. \n \n THE DOCTRINE OF HELL\n \n (Mat 13:49-50 KJV) So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, {50} And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\n \n The doctrine of hell is one of the most neglected doctrines in all of Scripture. When hell is mentioned today, it is generally ridiculed, as if the whole idea of hell were so old-fashioned that only the naive and ignorant would really believe that such a place actually exists. This is not hard to understand. Natural men hate the idea of being held accountable for their lives to a holy God, because they love sin and do not wish to part with it. The carnal mind throws up objection after objection to the idea of hell because it does not want to face the reality of it. Men live their lives thinking that maybe if they ignore a difficulty long enough, it will go away. Even conservative religious leaders are now attacking hell.\n \n Let men do what they will, the frivolous objections of the foolish will not do away with hell. Amid the clamour to annihilate hell, those who believe the Bible to be true must stand and speak. Your consideration of the terrors of hell may be one of the most important things you can do in this life. (Ezek 33:4 KJV) Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. Please, I implore you, invest the time it takes to read this chapter and book to the end.\n \n Why should we be so concerned about hell? Why should we spend time reading about hell? There are several reasons why it is profitable to do so:\n \n 1) Hearing about the terrors of hell may shock your conscience and awaken you out of your false security.\n \n 2) Hearing about hell helps to deter men from committing sin. Both the godly and the ungodly are persuaded not to sin as much when they are regularly reminded of the terrors of hell.\n \n 3) Hearing about the terrors of hell may help to awaken those among us who may think they are saved because they believe in Christ or the facts of the gospel, but who are not really saved and are on their way to hell, but don't know it.\n \n 4) Preaching the doctrine of hell is profitable to both the godly and the ungodly alike, as will be demonstrated.\n \n Why aren't people fearful of hell? There seems to be a real lack of fear today of the reality of hell. This applies to both those who are in the church and those who are in the world. People are not afraid of hell. Why? You would not be afraid of a lion when it is only painted in a picture upon a wall. Why is this? Because it is only a picture. You know that it is not real. But if you were left alone in a jungle and came face to face with a real lion that growled ferociously at you, you would be terrified. The consciences of men are much like the man who only views the painted lion.\n \n We hear of hell in the Bible. We know that the Lord Jesus spoke of hell. In fact, Christ spoke more of hell than anyone else in the Scriptures. Why do men not believe hell is real? Because they do not hear enough about it. We don't study what the Scriptures say about hell. It is not just what we hear which makes up what we believe, it is what we don't hear as well which helps to form our belief system. Only the Spirit of God can present the terrors of hell to our hearts in such a way as to see them alive before us. The doctrine of hell has been used by God more often to the conversion of sinners than any other doctrine in the Scriptures. Pray now that as you read this chapter the Holy Spirit will set hell before you as real indeed.\n \n THE NECESSITY OF HELL\n \n Most who scoff at hell today probably do so for several reasons. Primary among them is a desire to pursue their own paths of sin without having their consciences troubled about the consequences of their actions. They do not want to hear that what they are doing is wrong. They do not want to hear that their sin will be punished. I can hear someone say, \"But isn't eternal torment in hell inconsistent with a merciful and loving God? How could a good God punish people in hell forever?\" A misunderstanding of the character of God and the nature of sin can easily lead to such questions. Why is hell necessary? Let us examine several reasons for the necessity of hell.\n \n 1) The Great Evil in Sin and the Holiness of God. The difficulty most people have in understanding the necessity of hell is related to an incomplete and inadequate understanding of both how awful sin is and how glorious God is. We do not see what a great evil is in the least sin, nor do we understand God's holiness, His justice, and His wrath. If we saw sin as the greatest evil in the world and realized that every sin is a rejection of God's rule over us, a sneering at Him, a shaking of our fist in His face, and a hurling of dung at Him, we would begin to understand a small bit of what our sin is like to God. Every time we sin, we either set ourselves, or a pet lust, up in our hearts as a rival god. Sin rejects the Creator as God and sets up the creature in His place. If we could comprehend God's holiness and what it means to be holy, pure, perfect, upright, and untainted by the least sin, we would have a better idea of why God hates sin so much. Absolute holiness cannot tolerate the least sin, Habakkuk 1:13 \"Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: ...\"\n \n If we could understand the glorious holiness and purity of God and also the abominable nature of sin more, then we would have no problem with the absolute necessity of hell. (Jer 17:9 KJV) \"The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?\" The human heart is sick. The human heart is wicked. The human heart is deceitful. The corruption in the heart causes us to be deceived about the awfulness of sin as well as many other things.\n \n 2) God's Infinite Nature. In understanding what our sin is really like, we must view it through the eyes of God. God is an infinite, eternal being. Every act of sin is committed against an infinite, holy God. In every act of sin we dethrone God and set ourselves above God. In every sin this question is the issue, \"Whose will shall be done, God's will or man's? Now, man by sin sets his own will above the Lord's, and so kicks God as filth under his feet.\"1 A single act of sin committed against a holy, infinite God deserves infinite punishment. It is an infinite evil to offend an infinite God even once.\n \n 3) Divine Justice. Even one sin against God calls for God to vindicate His name and His justice by punishing it as fully as it deserves. God can and will vindicate His justice. He promises to do so in Romans 12:19 where it says, \"Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. One of the greatest preachers that ever lived, Jonathan Edwards, wrote, \"The glory of God is the greatest good; it is that which is the chief end of creation; it is of greater importance than anything else. But this is one way wherein God will glorify Himself, as in the eternal destruction of ungodly men He will glorify His justice. Therein He will appear as a just governor of the world. The vindictive justice of God will appear strict, exact, awful, and terrible, and therefore glorious.\"2\n \n A DESCRIPTION OF HELL\n \n Hell is a furnace of unquenchable fire, a place of everlasting punishment, where its victims are tormented in both their bodies and their minds in accordance with their sinful natures, their actual sins committed, and the amount of spiritual light given to them, which they rejected. Hell is a place from which God's mercy and goodness have been withdrawn, where God's wrath is revealed as a terrifying, consuming fire, and men live with unfulfilled lusts and desires in torment forever and ever.\n \n In Matthew 13:47-50 the Lord Jesus tells a parable relating to the judgment. In verses 49-50, the Lord describes the fate of the wicked: \"So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, {50} And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\"\n \n In examining these words of the Lord Jesus we should first notice that hell is described as being a furnace of fire. Nebuchadnezzar's furnace was heated seven times hotter than normal and is described as \"a burning fiery furnace\" (Daniel 3:23). John the Baptist spoke of \"unquenchable fire\" and Revelation describes hell as \"a lake of fire burning with brimstone\" (Revelation 19:20). Can we really imagine the horror of which these words speak? Imagine every part of your body on fire at the same time, so that every fiber of your being felt the intense torment of being burned. How long could you endure such punishment? Christ tells us that \"there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\" The lost will wail and gnash their teeth from having to endure the most intense pain and suffering they have ever felt as the flames consume them and constantly burn every part of their bodies. And there will be no relief.\n \n Jonathan Edwards describes in graphic language what the fires of hell will be like: \"Some of you have seen buildings on fire; imagine therefore with yourselves, what a poor hand you would make at fighting with the flames, if you were in the midst of so great and fierce a fire. You have often seen a spider or some other noisome insect, when thrown into the midst of a fierce fire, and have observed how immediately it yields to the force of the flames. There is no long struggle, no fighting against the fire, no strength exerted to oppose the heat, or to fly from it; but it immediately stretches forth and yields; and the fire takes possession of it, and at once it becomes full of fire. Here is a little image of what you will be in hell, except you repent and fly to Christ. To encourage yourselves that you will set yourselves to bear hell-torments as well as you can, is just as if a worm, that is about to be thrown into a glowing furnace, should swell and fortify itself, and prepare itself to fight the flames.\"3 Hell is also described as a place of darkness. The Lord tells us of the guest without wedding clothes who was cast \"into outer darkness\" (Matthew 22:13). Jude writes of those in hell \"to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever\" (Jude 13). Christopher Love says in his work Hell's Terrors: \"darkness is terrible, and men are more apt to fear in the dark then light: hell is therefore set forth in so terrible an expression, to make the hearts of men tremble; not only darkness, but the blackness of darkness\" 4\n \n Hell is compared to Tophet in Isaiah 30:33. Tophet was the place where the idolatrous Jews sacrificed their children to the heathen god Molech by casting them into the fire. Day and night shrieks and howls were heard in that place, as day and night shrieks, howls, and wailing are heard in hell. Isaiah speaks of \"wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it\" setting hell ablaze. There is good evidence from the Scriptures that God Himself will be the fire in hell. Hebrews 12:29 says, \"For our God is a consuming fire.\" The ungodly on earth ignorantly dance for joy when they hear pastors speak about the love and mercy of God, but they will be the beneficiaries of neither, unless they repent. To them God will be an all consuming fire. Hebrews 10:30-31 warns: \"For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people. {31} It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.\"\n \n You shall not escape hell, sinner. God will be your hell and His wrath will consume you and be poured upon you as long as He exists. \"(Psa 90:11 KJV) Who knoweth the power of thine anger?...\" It is because God Himself will be the fire in hell that words cannot possibly express the terrors of the damned in hell. \"There is no reason to suspect that possibly ministers set forth this matter beyond what it really is, that possibly it is not so dreadful and terrible as it is pretended, and that ministers strain the description of it beyond just bounds...We have rather reason to suppose that after we have said our utmost, all that we have said or thought is but a faint shadow of reality.\"5 In Luke 16:19-26 Christ tells us of two men. One of them was rich (he has traditionally been called Dives); the other man was poor (his name was Lazarus). Both men died. The poor man was carried by angels to heaven and the rich man went to hell. The rich man did not go to hell because he was rich, nor did the poor man go to heaven simply because he was poor. The Lord shows us through this contrast that our circumstances may change drastically when we pass from time into eternity. We are not to be fooled that just because God may not have dealt harshly with us here, that he will not do so after death. The eternal abiding place of both men resulted from the condition of their hearts before God, while they were on earth. Lazarus was a true follower of God. Dives was not. We want to carefully note what the Scriptures tell us about Dives and his condition, for from that we may learn much about hell. Verses 23-24 indicate to us that Dives is \"in torment.\" What does it mean to be \"in torment?\" This torment refers to both torment in body and torment in soul as well. As we have seen, men's bodies will be tormented in a furnace of fire. Every part of the body will feel the pain of that fire. Men with severe stomach pains can be in great agony from that alone, but this pain will be far greater. Death from cancer is sometimes said to cause extreme pain in the body, but the pain of hell will be far worse. If your body were afflicted with many different and painful diseases all at the same time, you still would not begin to approach the pain of the damned in hell.\n \n Men's consciences shall be in torment in hell as well. Conscience is the worm that will not die which the Scriptures speak of (Mark 9:48; Isaiah 66:24). Dives is told to \"remember that during your life.\" Men will be tormented with extreme pain, but they will also be tormented by their own memories. They will remember hearing of hell and scoffing at it. They will remember being warned and told to repent or told that accepting the blessings of heaven without submitting to Christ as Lord falls short of salvation, but they took no heed to those warnings. They will be tormented by seeing at a distance the glories of heaven (as Dives was able to do), and knowing that for all eternity they will be damned. They will be tormented by unfulfilled desires and unfulfilled lusts (Dives is not able to receive even a drop of water to cool his tongue). They will be tormented by the knowledge that they will never escape from hell (Dives is told that \"neither can you pass to us\"). They will be tormented by the cries, shrieks, and curses of the damned around them. The most extreme torments a man can experience on earth will be like flea bites compared to the torments of hell.\n \n Jonathan Edwards speaks of men unable to find even a moment of relief in hell in his sermon on The Future Punishment of the Wicked: \"Nor will they ever be able to find anything to relieve them in hell. They will never find any resting place there; any secret corner, which will be cooler than the rest, where they may have a little respite, a small abatement of the extremity of their torment. They never will be able to find any cooling stream or fountain, in any part of that world of torment; no, nor so much as a drop of water to cool their tongues. They will find no company to give them any comfort, or do them the least good. They will find no place, where they can remain, and rest, and take breath for one minute: for they will be tormented with fire and brimstone; and they will have no rest day nor night forever and ever.\"6\n \n THE ETERNITY OF HELL\n \n The most terrifying aspect of all about hell is its length or duration. Hell is eternal. Hell will last forever. Can you comprehend eternity? No mathematical equation or formula can explain it. Your mind cannot conceive of eternity, but it is none the less real. This aspect of hell alone should cause men to cry out in repentance. It is not surprising that skeptics of all ages have attacked the eternal nature of hell, substituting doctrines like the annihilation of the wicked in its place.\n \n Let us look at the Scriptures to verify the eternal nature of hell and to try and understand eternity better. Then we will explore why hell must be eternal. (Rev 20:10 KJV) And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever. This verse clearly gives us the duration of hell. Hell is forever and ever. How could a stronger, more certain expression be used? If the Spirit of God wanted to communicate the eternal nature of hell to men what could communicate it better than the expression \"forever and ever?\" The Scripture has no higher expression which is used to denote eternity than \"forever and ever\" for it is the very phrase used to tell us of the eternal existence of God Himself, as in Revelation 4:9: \"to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,\"\n \n Does anyone doubt that God will live to all eternity? How then can you doubt that hell will not last to all eternity when the same expression is used for both? \"We can conceive but little of the matter; but to help your conception, imagine yourself to be cast into a fiery oven, or a great furnace, where your pain would be as much greater than that occasioned by accidentally touching a coal of fire, as the heat is greater. Imagine also that your body were to lie there for a quarter of an hour, full of fire, and all the while full of quick sense; what horror would you feel at the entrance of such a furnace! and how long would that quarter of an hour seem to you! And after you had endured it for one minute, how overbearing would it be to you to think that you had to endure the other fourteen! But what would be the effect on your soul, if you knew you must lie there enduring that torment to the full for twenty-four hours...for a whole year...for a thousand years! Oh, then, how would your hearts sink, if you knew, that you must bear it forever and ever! that there would be no end! that after millions of millions of ages, your torment would be no nearer to an end, and that you never, never should be delivered! But your torment in hell will be immensely greater than this illustration represents.\"7\n \n Christ, describing the great day of judgment, tells of the separation of the wicked and the righteous using these words: \"(Mat 25:46 KJV) And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.\" Is there anyone who would deny that heaven exists eternally? Will the lives of the blessed in heaven be brought to an end one day? Of course not. But the same Greek word is used here in this verse to speak of the eternal life of the righteous and the everlasting punishment of the wicked.\n \n Hell will last as long as heaven does. In hell there will be different degrees of torment appointed to men as indicated by a number of Scriptures. Luke 12:47-48 says: \"And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. {48} But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes....\"\n \n Christ says in Matthew 11:24: \"But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.\n \n The verses in Matthew indicate that the people in Capernaum will receive a greater punishment on judgment day than those who had lived in Sodom. The verses in Luke speak of a differentiation in judgment based on the amount of light received: some will receive many stripes and others will receive few. Those who commit greater sins than others or more sins than others will receive greater punishment in hell (John 19:11). Religious hypocrites, those who profess Christianity but are not real Christians, will be punished more severely than others (Matthew 23:14-15). The Lord said of Judas Iscariot, \"it had been good for that man if he had not been born.\" (Matthew 26:24). How could any of these things be said to be true if annihilation were what awaited men after death? The presence of different degrees of punishment only makes sense in light of the ability to sensibly feel the torment. Could it be said that it would have been better for Judas if he had never been born if annihilation was all that awaited him?\n \n Annihilation is like no punishment at all. Each time the unbeliever sins he is adding to his torment in hell. The person who sins twice as much as another with similar light will receive twice as much punishment. Every day that sinners continue to live and breathe here on earth without repenting, they are adding to their torments in hell. Romans 2:5 tells us: \"But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;\"\n \n The Lord Jesus encouraged the righteous to lay up treasures in heaven rather than on earth. The wicked are increasing their future wrath and torment in hell every day by their continued sinning. They add to their punishment daily. In hell men will wish that they had never been born. Charles Haddon Spurgeon said: \"In hell there is no hope. They have not even the hope of dying--the hope of being annihilated. They are forever--forever--forever lost! On every chain in hell, there is written \"forever\". In the fires there, blaze out the words, \"forever\". Above their heads, they read, \"forever\". Their eyes are galled and their hearts are pained with the thought that it is \"forever\". Oh, if I could tell you tonight that hell would one day be burned out, and that those who were lost might be saved, there would be a jubilee in hell at the very thought of it. But it cannot be--it is \"forever\" they are cast into the outer darkness.\"8\n \n Christopher Love uses an illustration to try and help us understand what eternity means: \"Suppose all the mountains of the earth were mountains of sand, and many more mountains still added thereto, till they reached up to heaven, and a little bird should once in every thousand years take one (grain of) sand of this mountain, there would be an innumerable company of years pass over before that mass of sand would be consumed and taken away, and yet this time would have an end; and it would be happy for man, if hell were no longer than this time; but this is man's misery in hell, he shall be in no more hope of coming out after he hath been there millions of years, then he was when he was first cast in there; for his torments shall be to eternity, without end, because the God that damns him is eternal.\"9 Earlier we looked at the necessity of hell or why there must be a place like hell. Now we will look at why hell must not only exist, but why it must exist eternally.\n \n Why is it necessary that hell be eternal? There are several answers to this which we shall explore briefly. The first reason we will look at is the one mentioned by Christopher Love in the passage just quoted. The God who damns men is an eternal God. \"Ultimately the eternality of hell is based upon the nature of God.\"10 Is God's Word eternal? Is God's nature eternal? The Scripture tells us: \"(Heb 13:8 KJV) Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.\n \n (Psa 111:3 KJV) \"His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.\"\n \n 1 Pet. 1:25 \"....But the word of the Lord endureth for ever.\"\n \n If God's Word is eternal, if God's righteousness is eternal, if God Himself is eternal, then why shouldn't His wrath be eternal as well? As eternally existent, all of God's attributes are eternal and immutable; therefore, hell, as an expression of God's wrath, must be eternal. Hell must be eternal because God's justice could never be satisfied by the punishment of sinners no matter how long it lasts.\n \n Christ makes this clear when He speaks about settling with your accuser before you get to court, otherwise you shall be cast into prison and \"I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite\" (Luke 12:59). Man can do nothing to pay for his sins. No amount of punishment in hell, no matter how long, can ever atone for sins. It is impossible; therefore, hell must be eternal.\n \n Thirdly, hell must be eternal because the Scriptures tell us that the worm which gnaws the conscience of men in hell never dies. \"for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched...\" (Isaiah 66:24). If the worm never dies, then those being tormented by the worm shall never die. Lastly, hell will be eternal because men continue to sin in hell. They increase and compound their guilt there. Hell is a place where tormented men curse God, curse themselves, and scream and wail with blasphemous language at their fellow men around them. Wicked men will increase each other's torments as they accuse, blame, and condemn one another. Men will not repent in hell because the character of sinners does not change. They remain sinners. Men will sin to eternity, therefore, God will punish them eternally.\n \n APPLICATION TO BELIEVERS AND UNBELIEVERS\n \n The Old Testament prophets warn us repeatedly of the dangers of hell: \"Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?\" (Isaiah 33:14, KJV). \"(Nahum 1:6 KJV) Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.\"\n \n Sinner, are you so arrogant as to think you can bear the wrath of God poured out in full measure upon you? You may think that hell is not so hot and that you will be able to bear it quite well. If you believe that you are more than a fool. The terrors of hell cause the devils to tremble and are you so foolish as to be unmoved by them or make light of them?\n \n Do not think that simply because you go to church, or believe in God, or believe intellectually in the truths of Christianity that you will escape hell. The majority of those who regularly attend churches every week, all over the world, will go to hell. Thomas Shepard, pastor and founder of Harvard University, wrote: \"Formal professors and carnal gospelers have a thing like faith, and like sorrow, and like true repentance, and like good desires, but yet they be but pictures; they deceive others and themselves too...most of them that live in the church shall perish.\"11 You who profess to be Christians, but do not read your Bible much and pray little: how shall you escape the damnation of hell? You who are not especially bothered by little sins or troubled by the vain and filthy thoughts which you have: are you ready to go to hell? You who think the kingdom of God consists in a verbal profession of Christ or intellectually believing that Jesus died for your sins, but who are not concerned with living a holy, godly life and give little or no thought to God during the week: are you prepared to endure the torments of hell, day and night, forever and ever? You had better be, because if these things are true of you, you are headed straight for hell, unless you repent. Do not delude yourself!\n \n Christianity does not consist in words, or pious statements, or mere intellectual belief, but in a new heart and a new life dedicated to not sinning and living for the glory of God. If your heart and life have not been changed by God, you are still in your sins. If you are living in known disobedience to the word of God and are unconcerned about it, you have no right to assume you are going to heaven: you are on your way to hell! Repent of all your sins and turn to Jesus Christ and surrender to Him as Lord. Listen to the words of Christ: \"(Mat 18:9 KJV) And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.\n \n \"Nothing short of the complete denying of self, the abandoning of the dearest idol, the forsaking of the most cherished sinful course--figuratively represented under the cutting off of a right hand and the plucking out of a right eye--is what He claims from every one who would have true communion with Him.\"12 But remember, the difficulty involved in forsaking all for Christ is nothing compared to spending eternity in hell. I do not believe anyone can be scared into heaven, but I do believe they can be scared away from hell, so that they might begin to seek God with all their hearts, and to beg Christ to have mercy on them. Men stand on the brink of the pit of hell and are ready to fall headlong into it and yet they are completely unaware they are in any danger. If hearing about hell can cause otherwise senseless men to consider eternal truths, then preaching about hell is valuable indeed. It is better to view hell now, while you are living, and be terrified by it, than to have to endure hell forever when you die.\n \n I would not have you to be more afraid of hell than of sin. Sin is your real enemy. Sin is worse than hell because sin gave birth to hell. Would you be willing to go to hell for all eternity for the enjoyment of a little pleasure and lust here on earth? Flee from sin! Flee from living for self and self-pleasing to Jesus Christ. When you die it will be to late. All opportunity to repent ends at death. This doctrine is useful to the godly as well as the ungodly. The doctrine of hell should stir up within the righteous a fear of God. A godly fear is useful in many ways. The one who has a fear of God in his heart has a greater respect for the commandments of God. He who truly fears God will not fear men and would rather displease men than God (Isaiah 8:12-13).\n \n This doctrine should increase your faithfulness and joy in Christ that you have been delivered from the torments of hell and should likewise increase your love for Christ who endured the wrath of God upon the cross for you. The doctrine of hell should stir up within you a fear of sin. It should cause us to fear even little sins and be careful to confess and forsake sins of the heart and thought life also. Let the doctrine of hell keep you from the practice of sin.\n \n The doctrine of hell should help the godly to be patient under all outward, temporary afflictions which come to them. No matter how great your afflictions are in this world, they are far less than the torments of hell from which the Lord has freed the godly. You may have to undergo lesser torments while on earth, but remember they are only temporary and you have been freed from the greatest of all torments so you may rejoice even in a time of affliction.\n \n This doctrine is useful to motivate you to tell others of the message of Christ. Eryl Davies wrote in his book The Wrath of God: \"The eternity of hell's sufferings should make us the more zealous and eager to tell people of the only One who is able to rescue them. Do we shrink from declaring these solemn truths? Does the thought of hell displease us? Remember that God will be glorified even through the eternal sufferings of unbelievers in hell. His injured majesty will be vindicated...What is supreme in the purpose of God in the election and reprobation of men is His own glory, and hell also will glorify the justice, power, and wrath of God throughout eternity. In the meantime it is our responsibility to pray and work for the salvation of sinners before such awful punishment overtakes them.\"13\n \n I cannot leave without one final word to those who think they are converted, but are not; and also, to those who know themselves to be unconverted. Can you conceive of eternity? Stop now and try to imagine being tormented unceasingly, forever, without end. Does this not terrify you? Never a chance for a moment's rest. Never a drop of water to cool your parched throat. Think again of how long eternity is. Try to imagine it: day and night, forever and ever, burned with fire like a spider in a furnace of flames. Shrieking, howling, wailing, cursing the day you were born, and being cursed by the devils and damned souls around you eternally. Remembering, forever remembering, how you were warned on earth and how you ignored those warnings: self-satisfied and self-deceived that all was well with your soul. Job's wife told him to curse God and die. Unless you repent and flee to Jesus Christ, who is your only hope, you shall curse God eternally and be tormented by Him in His presence in the awful fullness of His wrath, and you shall never die. You shall never die. You shall never die! Eternity is forever!\n \n http://www.scionofzion.com/hell2.htm",

   "I'm not going to debate this with you but here is one explanation of the Doctrine of Hell from the Protestant perspective. Specifically the Calvinist perspective.

Even one sin against God calls for God to vindicate His name and His justice by punishing it as fully as it deserves. God can and will vindicate His justice. He promises to do so in Romans 12:19 where it says, \"Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. One of the greatest preachers that ever lived, Jonathan Edwards, wrote, \"The glory of God is the greatest good; it is that which is the chief end of creation; it is of greater importance than anything else. But this is one way wherein God will glorify Himself, as in the eternal destruction of ungodly men He will glorify His justice. Therein He will appear as a just governor of the world. The vindictive justice of God will appear strict, exact, awful, and terrible, and therefore glorious.\"2\n \n \n \n\n \n How does infinite torture equate with justice? What purpose does it serve other than for God's sadistic thrills watching his confused creations scream in torment? \n \n If you told me that God punished people for some remedial purpose so that they can see the error of their ways, I might at least understand if not accept. If you told me that God simply snuffed out the creations that don't cut it with him, I can understand this as well. But simply torturing people for all eternity because they cannot make the leap of faith or were raised in another religion is just sick. It's a level of evil beyond what any mere mortal would be capable of.",

But simply torturing people for all eternity because they cannot make the leap of faith or were raised in another religion is just sick. It's a level of evil beyond what any mere mortal would be capable of.\n\n \n Maybe this will help clarify it for you. The Christian doctrine of hell has long been a stumbling block for people to overcome when accepting Christianity. For surely a good God would not send people to hell, especially those who lead a pretty good life and had no possible opportunity to accept Christianity. Below, I will proceed to resolve this problem by first sharpening the apparent disharmony of the doctrine of hell, then pointing out some misconceptions, and finally by providing a positive Christian defense for the classic doctrine of hell.\n \n Typically the problem for the doctrine of hell is established as an unlikely consequence given that if the Christian God exists, he would essentially possess the characteristics of love, mercy, goodness, kindness, etc. Thus, based on the fact that God essentially possesses these characteristics maximally, then it is inconsistent for God also to create a place for the purpose of punishing those who choose not to believe in him, especially those who aren't overtly evil, or had minimal opportunity to accept Christianity. Some proponents of this objection go further to claim that if God creates hell and damns people to it, then God is positively evil. Another problem for the doctrine of hell comes from certain interpretations in the Bible. For example, in Matthew 7:13-14 Jesus seems to teach that the broad path, which is populated by those bound for hell, has a larger following than the narrow way, which leads to heaven. If this is so, one wonders why a good God would create a world knowing that a lopsided outcome was inevitable? Moreover, 1 Timothy 2:4 and 2 Peter 3:9 both seem to teach that God desires no one to go to hell. This makes the previous point even stronger - if God foreknew a lopsided ratio of humanity would go to hell, and God does not desire a single person to go to hell, why did he create this world and hell?\n \n Many of the apparent difficulties with the doctrine of hell disappear when certain misconceptions are clarified. The first one, is a misconception of God's character. While Christians affirm unequivocally that God is essentially good and loving, it must be emphasized that complementary to these attributes is the characteristic of justice. A loving being that ignored evil or that treated bad acts and good acts equally would not be good. Hence, if God is good, then God is also just - he must treat evil as evil. So, if any creatures merited the existence of hell, then God could remain essentially good and loving by giving them justice, even if that means sending some creatures to hell.\n \n A second misconception has to do with how one is \"sent\" to hell. Often objectors claim that God randomly picks people to be damned as if on a whim. Additionally, they envision that the one sent to hell is absolutely innocent in the matter and had nothing to do with the outcome. On the contrary, Christians have long held that hell is a choice that is made by the one who arrives there (e.g., in Matt. 7:13-14 Jesus says those who choose the broad path walk to destruction). Essentially, then, God does not send people to hell. Rather, people send themselves.\n \n 1Jo 3:8 He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.\n Jesus was sent to defeat and destroy evil by a Gracious and merciful God so that all of humanity can be saved from the hell God created for the devil and his fallen Angels. Anyone who rejects Jesus allies himself with evil and freely chooses the same end that is reserved for the devil. A just God must be Just. It's as simple as that.\n \n http://apologetics.johndepoe.com/hell.html\n \n \n ///",

The choice is ours. While he does not want any to perish and it grieves him that they will, the choice is still theirs.

Do you who haven't consciously received Christ sense the assurance of Gods Grace upon you in a real and vital way ? If not, then you haven't received the promised salvation because you haven't accepted the Messiah, Jesus Christ as your personal Savior. The passages below are from Jesus Himself and are pretty self explanatory.\n \n \n Jhn 3:18 \"He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.\n \n Jhn 3:36 He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.\"\n \n Jhn 8:31 \n Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, \"If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed.\n Jhn 8:32 \n \"And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\"\n Jhn 8:33 \n They answered Him, \"We are Abraham's descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How can You say, 'You will be made free'?\"\n Jhn 8:34 \n Jesus answered them, \"Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever commits sin is a slave of sin.\n Jhn 8:35 \n \"And a slave does not abide in the house forever, but a son abides forever.\n Jhn 8:36 \n \"Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed.\n Jhn 8:37 \n \"I know that you are Abraham's descendants, but you seek to kill Me, because My word has no place in you.\n Jhn 8:38 \n \"I speak what I have seen with My Father, and you do what you have seen with[fn12] your father.\"\n Jhn 8:39 \n They answered and said to Him, \"Abraham is our father.\" Jesus said to them, \"If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.\n Jhn 8:40 \n \"But now you seek to kill Me, a Man who has told you the truth which I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.\n Jhn 8:41 \n \"You do the deeds of your father.\" Then they said to Him, \"We were not born of fornication; we have one Father--God.\"\n Jhn 8:42 \n Jesus said to them, \"If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come of Myself, but He sent Me.\n Jhn 8:43 \n \"Why do you not understand My speech? Because you are not able to listen to My word.\n Jhn 8:44 \n \"You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father of it.\n Jhn 8:45 \n \"But because I tell the truth, you do not believe Me.\n Jhn 8:46 \n \"Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth, why do you not believe Me?\n Jhn 8:47 \n \"He who is of God hears God's words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.\"",

So I agree that there are verses that point to Gods Grace and Mercy so they support your perspective. But I have posted direct and clear verses that state that one MUST receive and accept Jesus and what He did on the Cross in order to be saved. \n \n Besides, the Gospel itself is based on Jesus being the propitiation for our sins. The perfect sacrificial Lamb of God who was worthy to pay the price for our sins once and for all time, unlike the repetitive animal sacrifices the Jews had to do prior to His coming. Nothing about it implies that we are universally saved and to imply such a thing is to mislead those who are seeking the truth right into oblivion. That is how important the responsibility to the truth is for those who know it Jo. And when one compromises on such an important detail it concerns me deeply about what else they are compromising on. \n \n I too have a complete family and friends that I love and don't want to think of as lost. But if I truly love them and want to see them in heaven someday then i must not compromise the truth so they'll like me here, but make sure they know the whole truth so when they accept it finally, they will truly be saved and not just plastic christians who will snap at the first application of pressure upon their christian walk.",

And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him.

But, the living example of the believer being aaround the unsaved spouse may lead the unbeliever to salvation...a form of evangelism. This was a statement born of logic by Paul and not a command from God. The believer could leave if it came down to it as this was no command by God but were pressured not to do so.\n \n The crucifixion of the Christ and his spilt blood did NOT save everyone. It was the ticket out of condemnation. One must believe in the whole message of the Christ and accept this sacrifice in their place.\n Any denial of these 'conditions' that come of free will leads to perdition and an eternal seperation. You have sin. You can chose to live forever in it (and God can NOT be near it) which means no Heaven for you or accept the only means to wipe it away.\n \n Think of it like this, you have muddy feet. God don't allow that in his home. Either you remain outside or wipe them off on the specially constructed door mat (Jesus).

How some don't is up to other factors.\n \n And Jo, John 3:17\n Jesus didn't come to condemn the world because it was already condemned.\n His mission wasn't to condemn it more (redundantly) but to offer a way out of that condemnation for those who would accept it of their own free will.\n \n And Jo, the spouse of a Christian IS NOT saved but sanctified.\n Paul states quite clearly that the believing spouse is NOT to leave the unbeliever because the beliver MAY lead the spouse to salvation.\n You did a real hatchet job with that.\n \n 1 Corinthians 7:12-16\n \"To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. \n \n But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so. A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?\"\n \n Simply marrying a believer does not save you. But, the living example of the believer being aaround the unsaved spouse may lead the unbeliever to salvation...a form of evangelism. This was a statement born of logic by Paul and not a command from God. The believer could leave if it came down to it as this was no command by God but were pressured not to do so.\n \n The crucifixion of the Christ and his spilt blood did NOT save everyone. It was the ticket out of condemnation. One must believe in the whole message of the Christ and accept this sacrifice in their place.\n Any denial of these 'conditions' that come of free will leads to perdition and an eternal seperation. You have sin. You can chose to live forever in it (and God can NOT be near it) which means no Heaven for you or accept the only means to wipe it away.\n \n Think of it like this, you have muddy feet. God don't allow that in his home. Either you remain outside or wipe them off on the specially constructed door mat (Jesus). God isn't going to do it for you...he's allergic to the mud.\n \n There are biblical passages to support this, both old testiment and new.\n\n \n Zardoz, as much as I disagree with you at times, I must say you are right on the money scripturally speaking here. Everything you've written is spot on, especially the bolded is absolutely the scriptural perspective. I applaud your post. emoticon_xagree",

   "Why not make something up?\n\n Because, more often than not, when you 'make stuff up' you're also contradicting the bible and messages it taught.\n Personally, I think most people do make stuff up or follow those who have gone before them and made stuff up. Thus the tangent Arch and I went off on dealing with what Tongues are according to scripture, tradition and historical context. He appears to follow the Pentecostal made up interpretation rather than what tongues litterally and historically ment in scripture. \n \n \nHowever, I also believe that parts of the Bible are contradictory, if humans are able to forgive even those who do not ask for it, and are commanded to do good to those who hate them, how can it be that God, who as we know is all loving and all powerful is not capable of saving those who are simply indifferent? The Bible is not the centre of the Christian message, it is simply one of the many means by which it is conveyed. Where it is in apparent contradiction with the work of the Spirit in the world, then I believe that the current working of the Spirit is of overriding importance, perceived through the \"still small voice of calm\", as it is widely known among Quakers.\n\n God seems to treat everyone the same from my perspective.\n Offers the same promise of eternal life for those who accept and repent of their sin and seek to sin no more. Those who do sin should seek to redress this wrong asap. \n The messages presented in the bible are the center of the Christian message. Without the bible, you'd have nothing other than to follow your own heart...which could be any message. At best, you may have oral tradition. Tradition is mentioned in the bible too. So long as it doesn't contradict scripture or detract from the worship of God, tradition can be good. \n \n Basically, rather than conform your beliefs to scripture and God's desires found therein, as all scripture is good for instruction and the betterment of believers, you seek to do the opposite and follow a different gosple of Jesus. Believing that the core is sufficient. As you pointed out, the core is VERY important but there are further issues that are also important. Rather than seek to turn the sinner away from their ways that are displeasing to God, you seek to justify their actions and say God will accept them just as they are.\n Jesus did not hang out with UNREPENTANT sinners. When He did approach them, he instructed them at every turn to sin no more. The adulteress was informed to do so. When he sat with the tax payers, did he give the nod of approval to their graft and corruption or specifically instruct them to take no more than was due? \n Whether you believe homosexuality is okay or not, engaging in sex prior to marriage is fornication which is specifically talked about. Engaging is sex with another after marriage is adultry. Gays are in a catch 22. Never before have they even been considered to be allowed to marry, so at best their actions are fornications, sexual sins nontheless.\n \n As for the work of the spirit in the world. It could be the spirit or a counterfeit (demonic influence). As the bible mentions, you should test the spirit according to what Scripture has to say.\n Quakers really haven't stood the test of time. \n \n @ShadowPikachu.\n While I personally agree with the notion of God as such (I've even discussed so in other threads), the Christian biblical stance is that We have condemned ourselves to a certain degree. Should God make people go to this awsome heaven place and be in his actual presence if they've already made their choice to disregard it for something else? If so, where's the free will?\n Should He make a special invitation to those 'hard to reach' when the same invite (as expressed in the bible and through those who teach it) is sufficient for others?\n \n As for Jefferson, actually seems he took a basic, stripped down definition. Like defining a human but cutting off the arms as they don't conform to what you think a human should be. Sin isn't just doing bad things to other people. It's disobeying Gods commands.\n One of the things I've noted on being a father is when teaching the young children to leap into your arms even though you give them no reason to do so. What some don't catch on to is that it builds trust and faith that the parent will catch you when you really have to jump some day (say from a burning building's window). Following some nonsensical rules early helps build that trust later when you may need it. The question on God is would He abuse that blind faith or take advantaqge of it? \n \n As for disregarding my stance, you're perfectly free to disregard any stance from anyone in favor of your own choices. However, basing it on how I present myself is merely attacking the messenger rather than the message. For an 'unbeliever' I certainly know a lot about the subject. \n \n In context (in the bubble) of Christianity, Arch is more accurate than most on what the bible says. Outside of it, or going by what I like/believe...I think the whole issue is junk. \n \n Oh and Jo is a He.\n And I do value his opinions...even if I disregard many of them as nonsensical. He was one of the few from a past gamers web site (Portent) who used rationality and sense to convince me that the death penalty as practiced in the US is not really just and had too many faults to be reliable. So, while I inately favor the death penalty, and had supported it for many years and don't care much about the life of others, in context of Justice, it isn't. \n \n As to the logical fallacy, what's being said is 'If you disagree with certain parts of the bible and believe them to be wrong, what gives your the authority to believe this?'\n Why believe A is wrong and not B? If A is written by the same man who wrote B, and you really oppose A, why do you support B?\n If you believe Jesus is the Messiah, the truth, light and one true way, why accept some beliefs about him and not others?\n If you accept what is taught, that God is triune in nature and that the physical incarnate Christ was sacrificed for the sins of man so that ANY who believe in Him get a ticket to eteranal life, why not also believe the converse, that those who chose not to believe will be damned by their own choices.\n \n In the legal field, when one part is proven wrong, the whole part is cast into doubt.\n \n If we're picking and choosing, what parts do we keep and what parts do we disregard? Is this all based on personal preferance? Who wants their ears tickled?\n \n \n Persoanlly, I like the message of Jo and SP. Why not? They sould pretty, make me feel better about myself and give me a chance to get there without doing anything special. \n I'd hate to have to lie and falsely repent of all the 'sins' that I've committed whn I really ain't repentant.

   "Rather than seek to turn the sinner away from their ways that are displeasing to God, you seek to justify their actions and say God will accept them just as they are.\n\n \n Not true. My whole point is that we are all sinners. It is not the act of repentance that saves us, any more than it is faith, salvation is a gift from God. Christ calls us to repent of our sins because our sins cause suffering to ourselves and to others, as well as causing offence to God. That said, the message I take from the Bible is that pointing out the sins of others and lecturing on what is sinful and what is not is not my place. The act of repentance is not just being sorry, but the resolution to turn to a new way. Repentance is a key part of being a Christian, but it comes after belief, it is a response to Christ's promise of salvation, not the ticket price for it.\n \n Your point about gay marriage is a false one, as it is only recently that marriage has become a legal contract, historically marriage began at consumation, whether that was before or after the solemnisation (and amongst all but the aristocracy it was usually before). I don't know what God's view of gay people in monogamous relationships dedicated to him are (the Bible is silent on the subject), but I do believe that God has continued to call men and women to his service who are in such relationships, and I have no evidence to believe that such relationships have the damaging consequences normally associated with sinful behaviour.\n \n Quakers have been around for 300 years, longer than most evangelical sects. The second oldest place of worship in my city is the Quaker meeting house (the oldest is the mediaeval priory church). They seem to be holding up well enough.\n \n BTW my \"why not make something up?\" was a rhetorical question, I was saying we shouldn't make things up, because we are searching for truth, not the something to make us feel good.\n \n EDIT: my other contention with using the Bible as the only source of doctrine is that it presupposes that no-one since then has had any valuable experience of God beyond that experienced by the early church. Why is it that people value the writings of Paul, who never met Jesus and exhibits some ideas that don't chime while with Christ's message, as infallible truth? Yet we have other writers, whose experience of God has been no less dramatic or profound, such as C.S. Lewis, Charles Wesley, John Calvin, St. Augustine and thousands of others who have no place in scripture, simply by dint of age. Why is the story of Lewis' conversion from Surprised by Joy any less valuable to us than that of Paul's conversion in Acts? Charlotte Elliot expressed my understanding of our position before God in the words of the hymn:\n \nJust as I am, without one plea,\n But that Thy blood was shed for me,\n And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,\n O Lamb of God, I come, I come.\n",

So, while I inately favor the death penalty, and had supported it for many years and don't care much about the life of others, in context of Justice, it isn't. \n\n Thanks, wasn't sure.\n \n Hm, I think I have about the same view as you on that - the one in the US is too faulty.\n \n \n\n As to the logical fallacy, what's being said is 'If you disagree with certain parts of the bible and believe them to be wrong, what gives your the authority to believe this?'\n\n No, that is not the logical fallacy I am highlighting. What I have a beef with is Archies statement: \"Either the bible is fully reliable, or none of it is.\"\n THAT is the logical fallacy, and THAT is what I have a problem with. It is a very clear logical fallacy, and something that no reasonable debater would use (and points would likely be lost in a formal debate).\n \n That said, I'd like to know, in simple terms, if you agree or disagree that the statement I am taking issue with is a logical fallacy, or if you are not sure, etc.\n \n If you haven't read my argument against Archies Logical Fallacy in post #37, I suggest you do before answering.\n \nWhy believe A is wrong and not B? If A is written by the same man who wrote B, and you really oppose A, why do you support B?\n If you believe Jesus is the Messiah, the truth, light and one true way, why accept some beliefs about him and not others?\n If you accept what is taught, that God is triune in nature and that the physical incarnate Christ was sacrificed for the sins of man so that ANY who believe in Him get a ticket to eteranal life, why not also believe the converse, that those who chose not to believe will be damned by their own choices.\n \n\n But as we said, we do not accept those exact things - and we have explained what we DO believe\n \n \n\n In the legal field, when one part is proven wrong, the whole part is cast into doubt.\n \n If we're picking and choosing, what parts do we keep and what parts do we disregard? Is this all based on personal preferance? Who wants their ears tickled?\n\n These questions have been addressed by Jo and myself.\n \n \n \n\n Persoanlly, I like the message of Jo and SP. Why not? They sould pretty, make me feel better about myself and give me a chance to get there without doing anything special. \n Thanks.\n \n \nI'd hate to have to lie and falsely repent of all the 'sins' that I've committed whn I really ain't repentant. An omnipotent god would see right through that dishonesty. No?\n\n \n Right on - that is also one thing I like to point out to people who use Pascal's wager to try to convince people to believe in God (that an the excellent question of \"Which God?\")",

   "Not true. My whole point is that we are all sinners. It is not the act of repentance that saves us, any more than it is faith, salvation is a gift from God.\n \n \n I'm sorry Jo, but you are missing the basic step to being truly saved. And you are so close. So much that you say is true yet you haven't received the indwelling of the Holy Spirit because you haven't repented of your sins and fully accepted that Jesus can take them from you. The first verse being particularly clear.\n Act 2:38 Then Peter said to them, \"Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.\n Act 3:19 Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,\n Act 8:22 Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.\n Act 17:30 Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent,\n \n \nChrist calls us to repent of our sins because our sins cause suffering to ourselves and to others, as well as causing offence to God. That said, the message I take from the Bible is that pointing out the sins of others and lecturing on what is sinful and what is not is not my place.\n \n \n Jo, if a believer doesn't tell the unbeliever about salvation, how will they learn ? Sharing the Gospel is the greatest act of loving another that you can do in life. Because if you lead them to Christ you lead them to eternal life.\n 2Ti 3:16 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;\n \nThe act of repentance is not just being sorry, but the resolution to turn to a new way. Repentance is a key part of being a Christian, but it comes after belief, it is a response to Christ's promise of salvation, not the ticket price for it.\n\n \n Sorry, repentance comes before acceptance. Repent, accept, receive. In that order.\n \n \nEDIT: my other contention with using the Bible as the only source of doctrine is that it presupposes that no-one since then has had any valuable experience of God beyond that experienced by the early church. Why is it that people value the writings of Paul, who never met Jesus and exhibits some ideas that don't chime while with Christ's message, as infallible truth? Yet we have other writers, whose experience of God has been no less dramatic or profound, such as C.S. Lewis, Charles Wesley, John Calvin, St. Augustine and thousands of others who have no place in scripture, simply by dint of age. Why is the story of Lewis' conversion from Surprised by Joy any less valuable to us than that of Paul's conversion in Acts? Charlotte Elliot expressed my understanding of our position before God in the words of the hymn:\n\n \n I would never say that Lewis, Wesley or Spurgeon weren't valid and spirit inspired believers whom God spoke through, just as I know God speaks through me and other believers I know through His Holy Spirit. But if anyone say's or writes anything that conflicts with the Word of God, avoid and reject it like the plague.",

But they are all wrong in what they do if they are attempting to justify killing in Gods name. \n \n My own brother, who is one of the most moral men I know in life has told me he has never sinned because according to this Worlds standards he is an upright man, and he knows it.

   "I'm not going to debate this with you but here is one explanation of the Doctrine of Hell from the Protestant perspective. Specifically the Calvinist perspective. And this isn't to say that I am a Calvinist either so don't make any assumptions. I read it though and agreed with it although I would have added some information it doesn't such as Hell was created for the devil and his angels, not man. We go there by choice. \n \n THE DOCTRINE OF HELL\n \n (Mat 13:49-50 KJV) So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, {50} And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\n \n The doctrine of hell is one of the most neglected doctrines in all of Scripture. When hell is mentioned today, it is generally ridiculed, as if the whole idea of hell were so old-fashioned that only the naive and ignorant would really believe that such a place actually exists. This is not hard to understand. Natural men hate the idea of being held accountable for their lives to a holy God, because they love sin and do not wish to part with it. The carnal mind throws up objection after objection to the idea of hell because it does not want to face the reality of it. Men live their lives thinking that maybe if they ignore a difficulty long enough, it will go away. Even conservative religious leaders are now attacking hell.\n \n Let men do what they will, the frivolous objections of the foolish will not do away with hell. Amid the clamour to annihilate hell, those who believe the Bible to be true must stand and speak. Your consideration of the terrors of hell may be one of the most important things you can do in this life. (Ezek 33:4 KJV) Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. Please, I implore you, invest the time it takes to read this chapter and book to the end.\n \n Why should we be so concerned about hell? Why should we spend time reading about hell? There are several reasons why it is profitable to do so:\n \n 1) Hearing about the terrors of hell may shock your conscience and awaken you out of your false security.\n \n 2) Hearing about hell helps to deter men from committing sin. Both the godly and the ungodly are persuaded not to sin as much when they are regularly reminded of the terrors of hell.\n \n 3) Hearing about the terrors of hell may help to awaken those among us who may think they are saved because they believe in Christ or the facts of the gospel, but who are not really saved and are on their way to hell, but don't know it.\n \n 4) Preaching the doctrine of hell is profitable to both the godly and the ungodly alike, as will be demonstrated.\n \n Why aren't people fearful of hell? There seems to be a real lack of fear today of the reality of hell. This applies to both those who are in the church and those who are in the world. People are not afraid of hell. Why? You would not be afraid of a lion when it is only painted in a picture upon a wall. Why is this? Because it is only a picture. You know that it is not real. But if you were left alone in a jungle and came face to face with a real lion that growled ferociously at you, you would be terrified. The consciences of men are much like the man who only views the painted lion.\n \n We hear of hell in the Bible. We know that the Lord Jesus spoke of hell. In fact, Christ spoke more of hell than anyone else in the Scriptures. Why do men not believe hell is real? Because they do not hear enough about it. We don't study what the Scriptures say about hell. It is not just what we hear which makes up what we believe, it is what we don't hear as well which helps to form our belief system. Only the Spirit of God can present the terrors of hell to our hearts in such a way as to see them alive before us. The doctrine of hell has been used by God more often to the conversion of sinners than any other doctrine in the Scriptures. Pray now that as you read this chapter the Holy Spirit will set hell before you as real indeed.\n \n THE NECESSITY OF HELL\n \n Most who scoff at hell today probably do so for several reasons. Primary among them is a desire to pursue their own paths of sin without having their consciences troubled about the consequences of their actions. They do not want to hear that what they are doing is wrong. They do not want to hear that their sin will be punished. I can hear someone say, \"But isn't eternal torment in hell inconsistent with a merciful and loving God? How could a good God punish people in hell forever?\" A misunderstanding of the character of God and the nature of sin can easily lead to such questions. Why is hell necessary? Let us examine several reasons for the necessity of hell.\n \n 1) The Great Evil in Sin and the Holiness of God. The difficulty most people have in understanding the necessity of hell is related to an incomplete and inadequate understanding of both how awful sin is and how glorious God is. We do not see what a great evil is in the least sin, nor do we understand God's holiness, His justice, and His wrath. If we saw sin as the greatest evil in the world and realized that every sin is a rejection of God's rule over us, a sneering at Him, a shaking of our fist in His face, and a hurling of dung at Him, we would begin to understand a small bit of what our sin is like to God. Every time we sin, we either set ourselves, or a pet lust, up in our hearts as a rival god. Sin rejects the Creator as God and sets up the creature in His place. If we could comprehend God's holiness and what it means to be holy, pure, perfect, upright, and untainted by the least sin, we would have a better idea of why God hates sin so much. Absolute holiness cannot tolerate the least sin, Habakkuk 1:13 \"Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: ...\"\n \n If we could understand the glorious holiness and purity of God and also the abominable nature of sin more, then we would have no problem with the absolute necessity of hell. (Jer 17:9 KJV) \"The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?\" The human heart is sick. The human heart is wicked. The human heart is deceitful. The corruption in the heart causes us to be deceived about the awfulness of sin as well as many other things.\n \n 2) God's Infinite Nature. In understanding what our sin is really like, we must view it through the eyes of God. God is an infinite, eternal being. Every act of sin is committed against an infinite, holy God. In every act of sin we dethrone God and set ourselves above God. In every sin this question is the issue, \"Whose will shall be done, God's will or man's? Now, man by sin sets his own will above the Lord's, and so kicks God as filth under his feet.\"1 A single act of sin committed against a holy, infinite God deserves infinite punishment. It is an infinite evil to offend an infinite God even once.\n \n 3) Divine Justice. Even one sin against God calls for God to vindicate His name and His justice by punishing it as fully as it deserves. God can and will vindicate His justice. He promises to do so in Romans 12:19 where it says, \"Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. One of the greatest preachers that ever lived, Jonathan Edwards, wrote, \"The glory of God is the greatest good; it is that which is the chief end of creation; it is of greater importance than anything else. But this is one way wherein God will glorify Himself, as in the eternal destruction of ungodly men He will glorify His justice. Therein He will appear as a just governor of the world. The vindictive justice of God will appear strict, exact, awful, and terrible, and therefore glorious.\"2\n \n A DESCRIPTION OF HELL\n \n Hell is a furnace of unquenchable fire, a place of everlasting punishment, where its victims are tormented in both their bodies and their minds in accordance with their sinful natures, their actual sins committed, and the amount of spiritual light given to them, which they rejected. Hell is a place from which God's mercy and goodness have been withdrawn, where God's wrath is revealed as a terrifying, consuming fire, and men live with unfulfilled lusts and desires in torment forever and ever.\n \n In Matthew 13:47-50 the Lord Jesus tells a parable relating to the judgment. In verses 49-50, the Lord describes the fate of the wicked: \"So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, {50} And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\"\n \n In examining these words of the Lord Jesus we should first notice that hell is described as being a furnace of fire. Nebuchadnezzar's furnace was heated seven times hotter than normal and is described as \"a burning fiery furnace\" (Daniel 3:23). John the Baptist spoke of \"unquenchable fire\" and Revelation describes hell as \"a lake of fire burning with brimstone\" (Revelation 19:20). Can we really imagine the horror of which these words speak? Imagine every part of your body on fire at the same time, so that every fiber of your being felt the intense torment of being burned. How long could you endure such punishment? Christ tells us that \"there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\" The lost will wail and gnash their teeth from having to endure the most intense pain and suffering they have ever felt as the flames consume them and constantly burn every part of their bodies. And there will be no relief.\n \n Jonathan Edwards describes in graphic language what the fires of hell will be like: \"Some of you have seen buildings on fire; imagine therefore with yourselves, what a poor hand you would make at fighting with the flames, if you were in the midst of so great and fierce a fire. You have often seen a spider or some other noisome insect, when thrown into the midst of a fierce fire, and have observed how immediately it yields to the force of the flames. There is no long struggle, no fighting against the fire, no strength exerted to oppose the heat, or to fly from it; but it immediately stretches forth and yields; and the fire takes possession of it, and at once it becomes full of fire. Here is a little image of what you will be in hell, except you repent and fly to Christ. To encourage yourselves that you will set yourselves to bear hell-torments as well as you can, is just as if a worm, that is about to be thrown into a glowing furnace, should swell and fortify itself, and prepare itself to fight the flames.\"3 Hell is also described as a place of darkness. The Lord tells us of the guest without wedding clothes who was cast \"into outer darkness\" (Matthew 22:13). Jude writes of those in hell \"to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever\" (Jude 13). Christopher Love says in his work Hell's Terrors: \"darkness is terrible, and men are more apt to fear in the dark then light: hell is therefore set forth in so terrible an expression, to make the hearts of men tremble; not only darkness, but the blackness of darkness\" 4\n \n Hell is compared to Tophet in Isaiah 30:33. Tophet was the place where the idolatrous Jews sacrificed their children to the heathen god Molech by casting them into the fire. Day and night shrieks and howls were heard in that place, as day and night shrieks, howls, and wailing are heard in hell. Isaiah speaks of \"wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it\" setting hell ablaze. There is good evidence from the Scriptures that God Himself will be the fire in hell. Hebrews 12:29 says, \"For our God is a consuming fire.\" The ungodly on earth ignorantly dance for joy when they hear pastors speak about the love and mercy of God, but they will be the beneficiaries of neither, unless they repent. To them God will be an all consuming fire. Hebrews 10:30-31 warns: \"For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people. {31} It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.\"\n \n You shall not escape hell, sinner. God will be your hell and His wrath will consume you and be poured upon you as long as He exists. \"(Psa 90:11 KJV) Who knoweth the power of thine anger?...\" It is because God Himself will be the fire in hell that words cannot possibly express the terrors of the damned in hell. \"There is no reason to suspect that possibly ministers set forth this matter beyond what it really is, that possibly it is not so dreadful and terrible as it is pretended, and that ministers strain the description of it beyond just bounds...We have rather reason to suppose that after we have said our utmost, all that we have said or thought is but a faint shadow of reality.\"5 In Luke 16:19-26 Christ tells us of two men. One of them was rich (he has traditionally been called Dives); the other man was poor (his name was Lazarus). Both men died. The poor man was carried by angels to heaven and the rich man went to hell. The rich man did not go to hell because he was rich, nor did the poor man go to heaven simply because he was poor. The Lord shows us through this contrast that our circumstances may change drastically when we pass from time into eternity. We are not to be fooled that just because God may not have dealt harshly with us here, that he will not do so after death. The eternal abiding place of both men resulted from the condition of their hearts before God, while they were on earth. Lazarus was a true follower of God. Dives was not. We want to carefully note what the Scriptures tell us about Dives and his condition, for from that we may learn much about hell. Verses 23-24 indicate to us that Dives is \"in torment.\" What does it mean to be \"in torment?\" This torment refers to both torment in body and torment in soul as well. As we have seen, men's bodies will be tormented in a furnace of fire. Every part of the body will feel the pain of that fire. Men with severe stomach pains can be in great agony from that alone, but this pain will be far greater. Death from cancer is sometimes said to cause extreme pain in the body, but the pain of hell will be far worse. If your body were afflicted with many different and painful diseases all at the same time, you still would not begin to approach the pain of the damned in hell.\n \n Men's consciences shall be in torment in hell as well. Conscience is the worm that will not die which the Scriptures speak of (Mark 9:48; Isaiah 66:24). Dives is told to \"remember that during your life.\" Men will be tormented with extreme pain, but they will also be tormented by their own memories. They will remember hearing of hell and scoffing at it. They will remember being warned and told to repent or told that accepting the blessings of heaven without submitting to Christ as Lord falls short of salvation, but they took no heed to those warnings. They will be tormented by seeing at a distance the glories of heaven (as Dives was able to do), and knowing that for all eternity they will be damned. They will be tormented by unfulfilled desires and unfulfilled lusts (Dives is not able to receive even a drop of water to cool his tongue). They will be tormented by the knowledge that they will never escape from hell (Dives is told that \"neither can you pass to us\"). They will be tormented by the cries, shrieks, and curses of the damned around them. The most extreme torments a man can experience on earth will be like flea bites compared to the torments of hell.\n \n Jonathan Edwards speaks of men unable to find even a moment of relief in hell in his sermon on The Future Punishment of the Wicked: \"Nor will they ever be able to find anything to relieve them in hell. They will never find any resting place there; any secret corner, which will be cooler than the rest, where they may have a little respite, a small abatement of the extremity of their torment. They never will be able to find any cooling stream or fountain, in any part of that world of torment; no, nor so much as a drop of water to cool their tongues. They will find no company to give them any comfort, or do them the least good. They will find no place, where they can remain, and rest, and take breath for one minute: for they will be tormented with fire and brimstone; and they will have no rest day nor night forever and ever.\"6\n \n THE ETERNITY OF HELL\n \n The most terrifying aspect of all about hell is its length or duration. Hell is eternal. Hell will last forever. Can you comprehend eternity? No mathematical equation or formula can explain it. Your mind cannot conceive of eternity, but it is none the less real. This aspect of hell alone should cause men to cry out in repentance. It is not surprising that skeptics of all ages have attacked the eternal nature of hell, substituting doctrines like the annihilation of the wicked in its place.\n \n Let us look at the Scriptures to verify the eternal nature of hell and to try and understand eternity better. Then we will explore why hell must be eternal. (Rev 20:10 KJV) And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever. This verse clearly gives us the duration of hell. Hell is forever and ever. How could a stronger, more certain expression be used? If the Spirit of God wanted to communicate the eternal nature of hell to men what could communicate it better than the expression \"forever and ever?\" The Scripture has no higher expression which is used to denote eternity than \"forever and ever\" for it is the very phrase used to tell us of the eternal existence of God Himself, as in Revelation 4:9: \"to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,\"\n \n Does anyone doubt that God will live to all eternity? How then can you doubt that hell will not last to all eternity when the same expression is used for both? \"We can conceive but little of the matter; but to help your conception, imagine yourself to be cast into a fiery oven, or a great furnace, where your pain would be as much greater than that occasioned by accidentally touching a coal of fire, as the heat is greater. Imagine also that your body were to lie there for a quarter of an hour, full of fire, and all the while full of quick sense; what horror would you feel at the entrance of such a furnace! and how long would that quarter of an hour seem to you! And after you had endured it for one minute, how overbearing would it be to you to think that you had to endure the other fourteen! But what would be the effect on your soul, if you knew you must lie there enduring that torment to the full for twenty-four hours...for a whole year...for a thousand years! Oh, then, how would your hearts sink, if you knew, that you must bear it forever and ever! that there would be no end! that after millions of millions of ages, your torment would be no nearer to an end, and that you never, never should be delivered! But your torment in hell will be immensely greater than this illustration represents.\"7\n \n Christ, describing the great day of judgment, tells of the separation of the wicked and the righteous using these words: \"(Mat 25:46 KJV) And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.\" Is there anyone who would deny that heaven exists eternally? Will the lives of the blessed in heaven be brought to an end one day? Of course not. But the same Greek word is used here in this verse to speak of the eternal life of the righteous and the everlasting punishment of the wicked.\n \n Hell will last as long as heaven does. In hell there will be different degrees of torment appointed to men as indicated by a number of Scriptures. Luke 12:47-48 says: \"And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. {48} But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes....\"\n \n Christ says in Matthew 11:24: \"But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.\n \n The verses in Matthew indicate that the people in Capernaum will receive a greater punishment on judgment day than those who had lived in Sodom. The verses in Luke speak of a differentiation in judgment based on the amount of light received: some will receive many stripes and others will receive few. Those who commit greater sins than others or more sins than others will receive greater punishment in hell (John 19:11). Religious hypocrites, those who profess Christianity but are not real Christians, will be punished more severely than others (Matthew 23:14-15). The Lord said of Judas Iscariot, \"it had been good for that man if he had not been born.\" (Matthew 26:24). How could any of these things be said to be true if annihilation were what awaited men after death? The presence of different degrees of punishment only makes sense in light of the ability to sensibly feel the torment. Could it be said that it would have been better for Judas if he had never been born if annihilation was all that awaited him?\n \n Annihilation is like no punishment at all. Each time the unbeliever sins he is adding to his torment in hell. The person who sins twice as much as another with similar light will receive twice as much punishment. Every day that sinners continue to live and breathe here on earth without repenting, they are adding to their torments in hell. Romans 2:5 tells us: \"But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;\"\n \n The Lord Jesus encouraged the righteous to lay up treasures in heaven rather than on earth. The wicked are increasing their future wrath and torment in hell every day by their continued sinning. They add to their punishment daily. In hell men will wish that they had never been born. Charles Haddon Spurgeon said: \"In hell there is no hope. They have not even the hope of dying--the hope of being annihilated. They are forever--forever--forever lost! On every chain in hell, there is written \"forever\". In the fires there, blaze out the words, \"forever\". Above their heads, they read, \"forever\". Their eyes are galled and their hearts are pained with the thought that it is \"forever\". Oh, if I could tell you tonight that hell would one day be burned out, and that those who were lost might be saved, there would be a jubilee in hell at the very thought of it. But it cannot be--it is \"forever\" they are cast into the outer darkness.\"8\n \n Christopher Love uses an illustration to try and help us understand what eternity means: \"Suppose all the mountains of the earth were mountains of sand, and many more mountains still added thereto, till they reached up to heaven, and a little bird should once in every thousand years take one (grain of) sand of this mountain, there would be an innumerable company of years pass over before that mass of sand would be consumed and taken away, and yet this time would have an end; and it would be happy for man, if hell were no longer than this time; but this is man's misery in hell, he shall be in no more hope of coming out after he hath been there millions of years, then he was when he was first cast in there; for his torments shall be to eternity, without end, because the God that damns him is eternal.\"9 Earlier we looked at the necessity of hell or why there must be a place like hell. Now we will look at why hell must not only exist, but why it must exist eternally.\n \n Why is it necessary that hell be eternal? There are several answers to this which we shall explore briefly. The first reason we will look at is the one mentioned by Christopher Love in the passage just quoted. The God who damns men is an eternal God. \"Ultimately the eternality of hell is based upon the nature of God.\"10 Is God's Word eternal? Is God's nature eternal? The Scripture tells us: \"(Heb 13:8 KJV) Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.\n \n (Psa 111:3 KJV) \"His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.\"\n \n 1 Pet. 1:25 \"....But the word of the Lord endureth for ever.\"\n \n If God's Word is eternal, if God's righteousness is eternal, if God Himself is eternal, then why shouldn't His wrath be eternal as well? As eternally existent, all of God's attributes are eternal and immutable; therefore, hell, as an expression of God's wrath, must be eternal. Hell must be eternal because God's justice could never be satisfied by the punishment of sinners no matter how long it lasts.\n \n Christ makes this clear when He speaks about settling with your accuser before you get to court, otherwise you shall be cast into prison and \"I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite\" (Luke 12:59). Man can do nothing to pay for his sins. No amount of punishment in hell, no matter how long, can ever atone for sins. It is impossible; therefore, hell must be eternal.\n \n Thirdly, hell must be eternal because the Scriptures tell us that the worm which gnaws the conscience of men in hell never dies. \"for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched...\" (Isaiah 66:24). If the worm never dies, then those being tormented by the worm shall never die. Lastly, hell will be eternal because men continue to sin in hell. They increase and compound their guilt there. Hell is a place where tormented men curse God, curse themselves, and scream and wail with blasphemous language at their fellow men around them. Wicked men will increase each other's torments as they accuse, blame, and condemn one another. Men will not repent in hell because the character of sinners does not change. They remain sinners. Men will sin to eternity, therefore, God will punish them eternally.\n \n APPLICATION TO BELIEVERS AND UNBELIEVERS\n \n The Old Testament prophets warn us repeatedly of the dangers of hell: \"Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?\" (Isaiah 33:14, KJV). \"(Nahum 1:6 KJV) Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.\"\n \n Sinner, are you so arrogant as to think you can bear the wrath of God poured out in full measure upon you? You may think that hell is not so hot and that you will be able to bear it quite well. If you believe that you are more than a fool. The terrors of hell cause the devils to tremble and are you so foolish as to be unmoved by them or make light of them?\n \n Do not think that simply because you go to church, or believe in God, or believe intellectually in the truths of Christianity that you will escape hell. The majority of those who regularly attend churches every week, all over the world, will go to hell. Thomas Shepard, pastor and founder of Harvard University, wrote: \"Formal professors and carnal gospelers have a thing like faith, and like sorrow, and like true repentance, and like good desires, but yet they be but pictures; they deceive others and themselves too...most of them that live in the church shall perish.\"11 You who profess to be Christians, but do not read your Bible much and pray little: how shall you escape the damnation of hell? You who are not especially bothered by little sins or troubled by the vain and filthy thoughts which you have: are you ready to go to hell? You who think the kingdom of God consists in a verbal profession of Christ or intellectually believing that Jesus died for your sins, but who are not concerned with living a holy, godly life and give little or no thought to God during the week: are you prepared to endure the torments of hell, day and night, forever and ever? You had better be, because if these things are true of you, you are headed straight for hell, unless you repent. Do not delude yourself!\n \n Christianity does not consist in words, or pious statements, or mere intellectual belief, but in a new heart and a new life dedicated to not sinning and living for the glory of God. If your heart and life have not been changed by God, you are still in your sins. If you are living in known disobedience to the word of God and are unconcerned about it, you have no right to assume you are going to heaven: you are on your way to hell! Repent of all your sins and turn to Jesus Christ and surrender to Him as Lord. Listen to the words of Christ: \"(Mat 18:9 KJV) And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.\n \n \"Nothing short of the complete denying of self, the abandoning of the dearest idol, the forsaking of the most cherished sinful course--figuratively represented under the cutting off of a right hand and the plucking out of a right eye--is what He claims from every one who would have true communion with Him.\"12 But remember, the difficulty involved in forsaking all for Christ is nothing compared to spending eternity in hell. I do not believe anyone can be scared into heaven, but I do believe they can be scared away from hell, so that they might begin to seek God with all their hearts, and to beg Christ to have mercy on them. Men stand on the brink of the pit of hell and are ready to fall headlong into it and yet they are completely unaware they are in any danger. If hearing about hell can cause otherwise senseless men to consider eternal truths, then preaching about hell is valuable indeed. It is better to view hell now, while you are living, and be terrified by it, than to have to endure hell forever when you die.\n \n I would not have you to be more afraid of hell than of sin. Sin is your real enemy. Sin is worse than hell because sin gave birth to hell. Would you be willing to go to hell for all eternity for the enjoyment of a little pleasure and lust here on earth? Flee from sin! Flee from living for self and self-pleasing to Jesus Christ. When you die it will be to late. All opportunity to repent ends at death. This doctrine is useful to the godly as well as the ungodly. The doctrine of hell should stir up within the righteous a fear of God. A godly fear is useful in many ways. The one who has a fear of God in his heart has a greater respect for the commandments of God. He who truly fears God will not fear men and would rather displease men than God (Isaiah 8:12-13).\n \n This doctrine should increase your faithfulness and joy in Christ that you have been delivered from the torments of hell and should likewise increase your love for Christ who endured the wrath of God upon the cross for you. The doctrine of hell should stir up within you a fear of sin. It should cause us to fear even little sins and be careful to confess and forsake sins of the heart and thought life also. Let the doctrine of hell keep you from the practice of sin.\n \n The doctrine of hell should help the godly to be patient under all outward, temporary afflictions which come to them. No matter how great your afflictions are in this world, they are far less than the torments of hell from which the Lord has freed the godly. You may have to undergo lesser torments while on earth, but remember they are only temporary and you have been freed from the greatest of all torments so you may rejoice even in a time of affliction.\n \n This doctrine is useful to motivate you to tell others of the message of Christ. Eryl Davies wrote in his book The Wrath of God: \"The eternity of hell's sufferings should make us the more zealous and eager to tell people of the only One who is able to rescue them. Do we shrink from declaring these solemn truths? Does the thought of hell displease us? Remember that God will be glorified even through the eternal sufferings of unbelievers in hell. His injured majesty will be vindicated...What is supreme in the purpose of God in the election and reprobation of men is His own glory, and hell also will glorify the justice, power, and wrath of God throughout eternity. In the meantime it is our responsibility to pray and work for the salvation of sinners before such awful punishment overtakes them.\"13\n \n I cannot leave without one final word to those who think they are converted, but are not; and also, to those who know themselves to be unconverted. Can you conceive of eternity? Stop now and try to imagine being tormented unceasingly, forever, without end. Does this not terrify you? Never a chance for a moment's rest. Never a drop of water to cool your parched throat. Think again of how long eternity is. Try to imagine it: day and night, forever and ever, burned with fire like a spider in a furnace of flames. Shrieking, howling, wailing, cursing the day you were born, and being cursed by the devils and damned souls around you eternally. Remembering, forever remembering, how you were warned on earth and how you ignored those warnings: self-satisfied and self-deceived that all was well with your soul. Job's wife told him to curse God and die. Unless you repent and flee to Jesus Christ, who is your only hope, you shall curse God eternally and be tormented by Him in His presence in the awful fullness of His wrath, and you shall never die. You shall never die. You shall never die! Eternity is forever!\n \n http://www.scionofzion.com/hell2.htm\n\n \n First of all, the god that you are describing makes Hitler look like a Disney character.

He was a member of the priestly aristocracy of the Jews, and was taken hostage by the Roman Empire in the great Jewish revolt of 66-70 A.D. Josephus spent the rest of his life in or around Rome as an advisor and historian to three emperors, Vespasian, Titus and Domitian. For centuries, the works of Josephus were more widely read in Europe than any book other than the Bible. They are invaluable sources of eyewitness testimony to the development of Western civilization, including the foundation and growth of Christianity in the 1st Century.\n \n Josephus - Biblical Accounts Outside the Bible\n Josephus mentions New Testament events and people in some of his works. For many skeptics, this is viewed as significant evidence against the myth and legend theories that plague early Christianity. Here are some excerpts:\n \n Josephus mentions Jesus in Antiquities, Book 18, chapter 3, paragraph 3 (this paragraph is so phenomenal, that scholars now debate the authenticity of some of the more \"favorable\" portions of this text): \n \n \"Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man; for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was [the] Christ. And when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him; for he appeared to them alive again the third day; as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him. And the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at this day.\" \n \n Josephus mentions John the Baptist and Herod in Antiquities, Book 18, chapter 5, paragraph 2: \n \n \"Now some of the Jews thought that the destruction of Herod's army came from God, and that very justly, as a punishment of what he did against John, that was called the Baptist: for Herod slew him, who was a good man, and commanded the Jews to exercise virtue, both as to righteousness towards one another, and piety towards God, and so to come to baptism; for that the washing [with water] would be acceptable to him, if they made use of it, not in order to the putting away [or the remission] of some sins [only], but for the purification of the body; supposing still that the soul was thoroughly purified beforehand by righteousness.\" \n \n Josephus mentions James, the brother of Jesus, in Antiquities, Book 20, chapter 9, paragraph 1: \n \n \"Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the sanhedrim of judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others, [or, some of his companions]; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned: but as for those who seemed the most equitable of the citizens, and such as were the most uneasy at the breach of the laws, they disliked what was done.\" \n \n Josephus mentions Ananias, the High Priest, who was mentioned in Acts 23:2:\n \n \"Now as soon as Albinus was come to the city of Jerusalem, he used all his endeavors and care that the country might be kept in peace, and this by destroying many of the Sicarii. But as for the high priest, Ananias he increased in glory every day, and this to a great degree, and had obtained the favor and esteem of the citizens in a signal manner; for he was a great hoarder up of money.\"",

   "This is another good point. I too find it imposible to believe in God not saving those that have been forced away - thousands upon thousnds of people are pushed away from Christianity when they hear the hateful rhetoric and fearmongering of preachers like Phelps, Hovind, Falwell, Pat Roberts, Bakker, Oral Roberts, Archangel, and pretty much any evangelical preacher. Most Atheists have had some sort of past experience with Christianity, and that experience pushes them away from the Church - usually it is the rhetoric preached by many evangelical churches.\n \n That is why I believe what I do - my beliefs are quite similar to yours. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n You speak of AP's \"hatred\" but take shots at him with every post that you make.

   "And check this link out on Biblical Archeology, specifically the Sumerian Tablets that list Pre-flood and Post-flood kings and the ages of those kings that coincide with what Genesis reports.\n \n http://www.allaboutarchaeology.org/biblical-archaeology.htm\n \n Biblical Archaeology: Ancient Civilization\n Biblical archaeology really begins with the Sumerian civilization of about 2500 BC. To date, numerous sites and artifacts have been uncovered that reveal a great deal about the ancient Mesopotamian culture. One of the most dramatic finds is the Sumerian King List, which dates to approximately 2100 BC. This collection of clay tablets and prisms is most exciting because it divides the Sumerian kings into two categories; those who reigned before the \"great flood\" and those who reigned after it. The lists are also dramatic because they include the ages of the kings before and after the \"great flood,\" which show the same phenomenal life span changes mentioned in the Bible. Actually, records of a global flood are found throughout most ancient cultures. For instance, the Epic of Gilgamesh from the ancient Babylonians contains an extensive flood story. Discovered on clay tablets in locations such as Ninevah and Megiddo, the Epic even includes a hero who built a great ship, filled it with animals, and used birds to see if the water had receded (see Genesis 7-8).\n \n Biblical Archaeology: Ancient Law & Culture\n Biblical archaeology continues with the great military civilizations of ancient Mesopotamia and their ultimate impact on law and culture throughout the region. One significant find is the Law Code of Hammurabi, which is a seven foot tall, black diorite carving containing about 300 laws of Babylon's King Hammurabi (Hammurapi). Dated to about 1750 BC, the Law Code contains many civil laws that are similar to those found in the first five books of the Bible. Another find at the ancient city of Nuzi near the Tigris River uncovered approximately 20,000 clay tablets. Dated between 1500 and 1400 BC, these cuneiform texts explain the culture and customs of the time, many of which are similar to those found in the early books of the Bible.\n \n Biblical Archaeology: Ancient Israel\n Biblical archaeology then turns to the evidence for the early Israelites. The Merneptah Stele (also known as the Israel Stele) is an upright stone slab measuring over seven feet tall that contains carved hieroglyphic text dating to approximately 1230 BC. The Egyptian stele describes the military victories of Pharaoh Merneptah and includes the earliest mention of \"Israel\" outside the Bible. Although the specific battles covered by the stele are not included in the Bible, the stele establishes extra-biblical evidence that the Israelites were already living as a people in ancient Canaan by 1230 BC. In addition to the Stele, a large wall picture was discovered in the great Karnak Temple of Luxor (ancient Thebes), which shows battle scenes between the Egyptians and Israelites. These scenes have also been attributed to Pharaoh Merneptah and date to approximately 1209 BC. The Karnak Temple also contains records of Pharaoh Shishak's military victories about 280 years later. Specifically, the Shishak Relief depicts Egypt's victory over King Rehoboam in about 925 BC, when Solomon's Temple in Judah was plundered. This is the exact event mentioned in 1 Kings 14 and 2 Chronicles 12. \n \n Outside Egypt, we also discover a wealth of evidence for the early Israelites. The Moabite Stone (Mesha Stele) is a three-foot stone slab discovered near Dibon ,East of the Dead Sea, that describes the reign of Mesha, King of Moab, around 850 BC. According to Genesis 19, the Moabites were neighbors of the Israelites. The stele covers victories by King Omri and Ahab of Israel against Moab, and Mesha's later victories on behalf of Moab against King Ahab's descendants (2 Kings 3). The Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser is a seven-foot, four-sided pillar of basalt that describes the victories of King Shalmaneser III of Assyria. Dated to about 841 BC, the Obelisk was discovered in the ancient palace of Nimrud and shows Israel's King Jehu kneeling before the Assyrian king in humble tribute (see 2 Kings 9-10).\n \n Biblical Archaeology: The House of David and Solomon's Temple\n Biblical archaeology covering ancient Israeli kings and culture received a huge lift in 1994 when archaeologists discovered a stone inscription at the ancient city of Dan, which refers to the \"House of David.\" The House of David Inscription (Tel Dan Inscription) is important because it's the first ancient reference to King David outside the Bible. Specifically, the stone is a victory pillar of a King in Damascus dated about 250 years after David's reign, which mentions a \"king of Israel\" (probably Joram, son of Ahab) and a king of the \"House of David\" (probably Ahaziah of Judah). Another important find is the House of Yahweh Ostracon, which is a pottery shard dated to about 800 BC that contains a written receipt for a donation of silver shekels to Solomon's Temple. Written approximately 130 years after the completion of the Temple, this appears to be the earliest mention of Solomon's Temple outside the Bible.",

   "Here's a list of the Messianic Prophecies that Jesus fulfilled in His life and by His existence. It not only attests to His existence but to the Bibles accuracy and truthfulness. There is an OT prophecy foretelling of an aspect of His life or ministry, and a New Testament verse speaking to it being fulfilled.\n \n Messianic Prophecy: What Is It?\n Messianic prophecy is the collection of over 100 predictions (a conservative estimate) in the Old Testament about the future Messiah of the Jewish people. These predictions were written by multiple authors, in numerous books, over approximately 1,000 years. Messianic Prophecy is so dramatic today, because with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the reliability of the Septuagint version of the Old Testament (both of which have been proven to exist prior to the time Jesus walked on the earth) you can be assured that these prophecies were not \"conspired\" after-the-fact.\n \n Messianic Prophecy: Fulfillment by Jesus Christ\n Messianic prophecy was fulfilled by the Messiah, Jesus Christ. Although many Jews did not accept Jesus as their Messiah, many did, and they became the Jewish sect later known as the Christians. Christianity, based in dramatic part on the fulfillment of historical prophecy, spread rapidly throughout the Roman Empire of the 1st Century. Examine the prophecies yourself, and calculate the probability of one man fulfilling just a handful of the most specific ones, and you'll be amazed.\n \n \"Jesus said to them, 'This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.'\" Luke 24:44 (NIV)\n \n The Old Testament verses are the prophecy; the New Testament verses proclaim the fulfillment.

Nay, Nicolaus of Damascus, in his ninety-sixth book, hath a particular relation about them; where he speaks thus: \"There is a great mountain in Armenia, over Minyas, called Baris, upon which it is reported that many who fled at the time of the Deluge were saved; and that one who was carried in an ark came on shore upon the top of it; and that the remains of the timber were a great while preserved.
