You have a population of animals, and they all have some variation in color and shape. Something preys on them. The one's that are the most visible, the ones that stick out, get eaten. The one's whose colors are kind of like their background are less likely to get eaten, and thus more likely to breed. You then get a new generation, which again has a range of colors and shapes. The range, however, has shifted. It's closer to the colors of the background environment. Again, those that are furthest in color from the background are the most visible and most likely to be eaten, those closest most likely to live and breed.

   "Dawkins had a nice bit on this problem - what good does it do to look 1% like a twig? \n \n It is easy to see how looking 90% like a twig can be very helpful, and how if the population shows a little variation, say from 89% like a twig to 91% like a twig, then on average the 91 percenters should do a little better. Thus each generation should have a slightly better percentage of being like a twig, and the process can proceed.\n \n But again, what good is being 1% like a twig? Surely any predator who is fooled by a 1% resemblance is likely to be too dumb to breathe, let alone to breed?\n \n Dawkins' answer was to suggest thinking about the insect at the end of the day, when the light is fading, the bird is tired, and possibly is no longer that hungry, so it is doing a half-assed job of hunting. At that point, a very slight resemblance to a twig might well save the insect where a 0% resemblance wouldn't. If that seems unrealistic, halve the light, double the bird's fatigue, and throw in an imminent storm that the bird is trying to beat home, or which has already started. \n \n Plus, as Iuris noted, breaking the expected outline can make something very hard to see, so camouflage can be very good long before it is perfect.\n \n http://op-for.com/camo.jpg",

We don't really see what we think we see. Take the picture above. For the first time when you see it, you see a couch. You have to look for a while (depending on experience and natural talent) to figure out where the human is. After that, you will forever know the picture, and will instantly recognize it. But doing so for the first time takes time.\n \n You can see everything, but the brain needs to figure out what that means.

If an Arctic bird has become white, and a forest bird green; if one insect is coloured like a leaf, another like the bark it clings to, we can easily see that it is only a step further in the same process for one insect to become exactly like another insect.\n \n Some persons, however, have objected, that so many steps are required in the process of making a white Leptalis resemble a highly coloured Ithomia, that the chances against the necessary variations occurring are infinite. It is forgotten, however, that both the groups to which these genera belong have been undergoing constant changes for countless generations.[/QUOTE]He's talking more of butterflys than anything else, but I contend the argument against random changes resulting in copies of surroundings being developed in the color and shape of an organism's exterior surface is valid.

It would likely take billions of trials to randomly generate a pattern that closely resembles something else.\n\n \n Here's my layman's explanation, though I'm quite sure you won't accept it -\n \n The animal itself does not \"want\" anything but to survive. In the case of the butterfly and most mimics, they certainly don't have the ability to consciously change or affect their appearance. In fact, they don't even need to be aware of their surroundings in order for the camoflauge to develop. ON EDIT: They don't need to be aware of how or why the predator is selecting either.\n \n The environment, and specifically, the predators, are what selects the camoflauge pattern, always favouring the most perfect match. Through countless generations, the pattern is selected for by the predator until it reaches near perfection.\n \n A simple, but not entirely accurate, analogy is the breeding of animals by man - we can select desired traits and continuously breed for those traits until we reach what we deem to be perfect, or at least, acceptable. Bassett Hounds didn't \"want\" to have short stubby legs and floppy ears, but the people controlling the breeding of the dogs selected for those traits as the ideal, in much the same manner as predators in nature would select traits among the butterflies so only those with best camoflauge patterns survived and continued to breed.\n \n Waxy",

I contend there had to be an effort on the part of the mimicing species to attain a specific, well-planned appearance similar to something that it observed within its own surroundings.\n\n \n Here's a solid bit of evidence against that argument. As you surely know, not everything has the same visual capabilites. Dogs are colorblind, bees see in the ultraviolet, deer see motion well but still things poorly, etc. That is to say, things \"look\" different depending on who is looking at them. In particular, insects and vertibrates have very different visual systems; they evolved completely seperately. If you could plug into a moth's eyes and see what it sees you would probably not have the slightest clue what you were looking at; it would be like looking through a filter, prism, and kalidescope all at the same time. And the same would be true in the other direction as well. So there's no way that a moth could decide that it wanted to look like something we would recognize as a face and strive towards that goal. Even if it could change it's appearence there's simply no way it would know how vertibrates see it. Its idea of what a face looks like and our idea of what a face look like are utterly alien. The fact that the pattern on the moth forms a pattern that we can recognize, that it confuses our visual system, shows that it was pressure from something with vision similar to ours that was driving the coloration, and not anything the moth was doing of its own accord.\n \n \n\n He's talking more of butterflys than anything else, but I contend the argument against random changes resulting in copies of surroundings being developed in the color and shape of an organism's exterior surface is valid. It would likely take billions of trials to randomly generate a pattern that closely resembles something else.\n\n Maybe more. But that's not a problem. Butterflies have been around for, what, hundreds of millions of years? With how many gagillion being born each year? There's been a huge pool to tinker with.",

Otherwise, I could see how you might think that a butterfly has to have seen an eye and tried to copy it.\n \n Many butterflies have bright spots that don't resemble eyes, along with a whole host of other striking markings.

Come on, make my day, you *&$%&#* \" However, most butterflies are perfectly edible, and most markings seem to work simply by startling the predator. As the predator approaches, the butterfly opens its wings in a flash of color that can be a bit of a surprise. As soon as it is airborne, the butterfly begins its bouncy, jerky, erratic flght pattern (slow overall progress but fast jumps from side to side), which is surprisingly difficult for a bird to defeat. The initial startle can be very helpful in getting the butterfly safely airborne.\n \n The next part is a wonderful example of what Peeling mentioned.

Animals follow other animal's eyes, as that provides excellent clues to overall body size, to which end of the animal is dangerous, and to whether it is aware of you. You've no doubt seen a cartoon where a character enters a cave, and a really huge pair of eyes opens up in the dark, and then, usually, a little critter with huge eyes wanders out into the light. Eye spots are like that: they suggest the face of a hidden animal (which is much bigger than the butterfly itself): the butterfly opens its wings to fly, and the attacker is suddenly facing two huge eyes, which forces a moment of \"oh ####, just exactly what am I headed toward here?\" doubt, which slows down the attack slightly.

Its like a courtroom. You don't like Dawkins, he does not like you, but thats not the issue. The issue is for others to reach a decision.\n \n \n \n The ultimate goal is to survive, thrive, and possibly self-replicate. Mimicry and camouflage are means to that end. The issue is-- by what mechanism is any degree of mimicry/camouflage achieved, and how much of it is necessary to make any difference wrt the above goals, as a defence against predation\n.\n \n In fact there is no evidence that there IS an ultimate goal! That kind of thinking distorts the evolutionary concept. The fitter DO survive and they may thrive, but that is not a goal, its just how things work!\n \n \nDarwinists argue that any degree of mimicry/camouflage is, [as they say about eyesight and every other trait], significantly effective and adaptively advantageous, no matter how slight, and that all such traits arise intially by the spontaneous generation of random, accidental, genetic alteration, or what they call, 'mutation', and increase accumulatively by the addition of more such accidental but fortuitous alterations, i.e., 'mutations', over ensuing generations.\n\n \n Natural selection (meaning differential survival/reproduction) can and does amplify very small advantages due to phenotype (heritable component). You can find the necessary equations in any text on quantitative genetics. You can plug in a relative fitness of 1.01 vs 1.0 and see how long it takes for the relevant gene to reach a high fraction of the population from any assumed initial prevalence.

   "JIM\n \nI am more puzzled by mimicry amongst the many species that exhibit same than by progressive foot development in a single species. I find it hard to believe that random mutations caused the Speckled Emperor Moth to develop a near perfect representation of large eyes on its hind wings. It seems that the creature developing these markings would have to impliment a procedure in which it would come to look like something it has seen already.\n\n \n Well you can start by considering all the moths that DID NOT develop that specific trait! There are a great many of them you know. That one linage (actually quite a few species) DID develop such a pattern by random search (ie evolution) is not particulary suprising if you put it in context rather than focusing only on the single species. Just think of all the moths that did not win this particular lottery - then it may become clearer to you. And then consider just how much time it took for that linage to win the lottery that one time. Millions of years, billions or trillions of lottery tickets, many many many losers, a very few winners, indeed many species which likely went down to extinction because they were not \"lucky\". Its a harsh and to humans a wasteful and bloody process, but the winners are the winners!\n \n \nI don't know the closeness of the octopus and the chameleon on the tree of life, but they both have the ability to discolor their skins to match their immediate surroundings. This ability does not appear to be the same as what drives the permanent colorations and shapes of some mimics. I'm not convinced that accidental changes can result in an animal that looks nearly exactly like something else when that something else is unrelated to the species except by side-by-side coexistence.\n\n \n Well invertebrates and vertebrates do share a common ancestor you know - at least the theory says thats the case. And an awful lot of genes are common to most species. The mechanisms of squids and octopi are in fact similar to those of chamelions.\n \n http://www.answers.com/topic/chromatophore?cat=health\n \n Covers some of the relevant basics. In Octopi and Chamelions chromatophores are under NEURAL control allowing rapid feedback from photosensing systems. In most other cases they are under hormonal control making them less responsive. Its interesting - read and enjoy. Lots more technical material avaialble of course. \n \n Not my field but on first glance this would appear to be a case of convergent evolution if you are familiar with the term. Its not much of a stretch to see how it could develop. Neural control by the way is basically hormonal control with the hormones being excreted by nerves closely appressed to the target. The mechanisms are actually quite similar.\n \n \nWhether for purposes of survival or jealousy, the mimic 'wanted' to look like something else. I contend there had to be an effort on the part of the mimicing species to attain a specific, well-planned appearance similar to something that it observed within its own surroundings.\n\n \n Nope, its not planned. The population of octopi did not have a meeting and take a vote on whether to develop neurally controlled chromatophores, no octopus genius said \"hey I could hide if I just could make and control my own chromatophores\". Evolution simply does not work that way (with the possible exception in the future of ourselves - where we DO sit down and possibly set such goals to engineer our own geneome).",

It is called \"random mutation\", but in point of fact mutations aren't 100% random. Which is not to say that they are directed in anything like a conscious manner. It's just that some genes are much more likely to mutate than others. Which genes are more likely to mutate is, in fact, an inheritable trait. If a gene that's \"useful\" to experiment with is easily mutatable then that species has an advantage and is more likely to prosper; if you monkey with the genes that control the strucutre of the heart you're not likely to have alot of viable offspring, that would be selected against.\n \n Let's take your example of the caterpillar with a snake head tail. Now, I don't even know if a genetic study of that bug has been done, so I can't say for 100% certain that what I'm proposing here is actual fact, but it fits the known data, and if I'm very wrong I'll be very surprised. For your caterpillar to arise only three things need to happen. The genes controling the color of the tail need to be highly likely to mutate, the genes that control the texture of the tail need to be highly likely to mutate, and the genes that control how mutable those genes are need to be likely to mutate. These are all fairly high probability chances, because creatures for which these things are true would have an edge. So what you have is a caterpillar which is basically trying out different tail designs. Every once in a while it might turn down the mutability of the color and shape genes; if that design works well the bug prospers, otherwise it dies out.\n \n I think what you see happening is that nature would be rolling a billion sided die, and needs to come up with 10 1's in a row. A much better analogy is that nature is throwing 1 million seperate million sided die, and keeping everything that comes up 10 or less. The odds that anything specific would turn up are really slim, but the odds that something comes up,especially given the billion year time span, is pretty much 100%.",

It's also important to look really hard for any unconscious assumptions you might be making, and on top of that there can be factors you simply didn't think of at all, like the evolved conservation of important genetic structures mentioned above.\n \n If you take another look at the snake-head caterpillar in hi-res, you'll notice that every segment of the caterpillar has a very similar pattern of colouration.\n \n Now, if you saw a caterpillar just like that, but without the distended front segments with enlarged versions of the spots, you wouldn't think it was 'trying' to look like a snake, despite there being only relatively minor morphological differences from what we see here.

And the basic morphology of a caterpillar is already very similar to a snake, yes?\n \n So once again, variation and predatory selection doesn't have to explain how something got from looking 0% or 1% like a snake to looking 80% or 90% like a snake. All it has to explain is how one species of caterpillar that coincidentally already had a pretty good chance of looking like a snake, got to look more like one.

You are actually on the high end (albeit not at the top) of the scale when it comes to trustworthiness and overall respect of intellect from my point of view. Don't sell yourself short.\n \n\n B. I think your questions have been answered and the point has been made for you repeatedly, in many different ways, as to how the adaptations arise and are selected for, you have simply incorrigibly refused these explanations in favour of your personal bias toward the belief they are designed or intentional on the part of the organism.\nThe simplest answers are often the hardest to fathom. I've seen it reduced here to natural selection and random mutations. I can understand how each of these might affect the shape and color of animals.\n \n It seems a random mutation first has to produce a difference, then natural selection (meaning those who were not selected as dinner entrees by their predators were able to select each other as mates) determines that those best marked to confuse or frighten the preying party will reproduce. It is still difficult to understand how a caterpillar's tail can come to look nearly exactly like a snake's head, complete with eyes and widened jaws. The one I linked looks more like a snake than the one Peeling linked. It's almost enough to make you look for a forked tongue flipping out occasionally to sample the air.\n \n \n \n\n Scout bees may very well be \"conscious\", show memory, and be able to act in such a manner, but show me one that is capable of willfully, and permanently, changing its appearance as a trait that will be passed on to its offspring, and you'll be a very famous scientist.\n \n They most certainly cannot perform such a feat, which was the point of my statement. My apologies if it wasn't clear.\nI misread what you said. I do not think bees can do that. What I misread into what you said was that insects can't be conscious of anything. My mistake.\n \n \n \nThis was explained very well by Kronus. I can't make it any clearer.\nYes. He did a fine job. As shown above, I have grasped that process. By selecting their meals and not selecting similar but marked beings of the same species, the marked ones survive and mate. Their marked progeny repeat the process.\n \n \n \n\n Random genetic mutations. Nothing more, nothing less. I know this is the heart of the issue for you, and you so far have refused to believe that such a mechanism can lead to the genetic structure that can mimic something so perfectly. \nI do find random to be a stumbling block. To say that the caterpillar's tail evolved in incremental steps to become visually identical to a snakes head seems to preclude the randomness of the changes.\n \n \n\n All I can tell you is that according the overwhelming majority of the scientific community that's the answer. I can't make you believe it.\nYou can lead an engineer to water, but you can't make him think.\n \n \n \n\n Rather than dismiss it out of hand, why not view the analogy for what it is and try to learn from it?\n \n There's genetic variation, a preferred pattern and a selection method. It's not as far removed as you may think.\nI am particular with analogies. If comparing things that operate under totally different rules, the analogy is invalid. Dog breeding for certain traits is certainly not random and has little to do with mutations or natural selection.

In part thats because people think of it as applying to only a single individual. In fact its population based. Within any POPULATION there will be subtle variants of any trait, some of that variation will be genetic and thus heritable. The variability is random but its distributed across the population. For example there is likely to be a graded variation in any population of the caterpillars which have the specific property of looking like a snake head on the one segment. Each linage is subject to selection and linages which repel predators best (even one percent better by the way) will expand their share of the species characteristic. This moves the population mean in the direction of \"greater snake headedness\". The next generation of course may move even further down the same gradient. Eventually one gets very fine tuned adaptations - unless of course the predators learn to eat the mimics somehow and not try to eat the snake that is being mimiced!\n \n One of my favorite cases of mimicry is among birds, plants, monarch butterflies, and another species of butterfly. The monarch is adapte. d to eathing plants with a high content of alkaloids which are both toxic and quite bitter. Birds tend to avoid eathing them because they taste just awful. The other butterfly imitates the monarch and also escapes predation, but its NOT adapted to ingest the alkaloids. Of course this also means that some birds having consumed the non-monarch species will sometimes chow down on a monarch by mistake! And it makes both species defense mechanisms less than perfect.

I have seen numerous videos concerning octopi and their apparent ability to think their way through obstacles to get to some bait set for them.\n \n There's a relatively newly discovered Indo-Malaysian Octopus that mimics other animals at will. Look at the pictures in the first link. In that particular case, it will be extremely difficult to convince me that the octopus doesn't look at things around him (or her) and adjust its physical shape and colorations to match a chosen animal. The octopus obviously looks at the sea snake and places geometrically precise alternating dark and light bands on its tentacles to mimic the snake. This seems to be a more advanced mentally driven coloration process than the mere changing of coloration to match nearby backgrounds. An issue that is harder to grasp is how the octopus knows that other animals fear the sea snake.\n \n While this is totally unrelated to the caterpillar's evolved 'snake head tail', it is evidence of graduated mentality in animals.

   "Evidently peeling, like all darwinists, doesn't know 'random' from a hole in the ground.\n\n \n But as you've already pointed out, I'm not a darwinist. You said so just the other day:\n \n \nDarwinists argue that any degree of mimicry/camouflage is, [as they say about eyesight and every other trait], significantly effective and adaptively advantageous, no matter how slight, and that all such traits arise intially by the spontaneous generation of random, accidental, genetic alteration, or what they call, 'mutation', and increase accumulatively by the addition of more such accidental but fortuitous alterations, i.e., 'mutations', over ensuing generations.\n\n \n This was in response to a post in which I said that mimicry doesn't need to start being a selective benefit at 1%, and explained why. Moreover I don't say that all traits arise by mutation, random or otherwise, nor that they are all amplified by further mutations. So go on, WW, call me a liar again - or retract your claim.\n \n \nFirst, the program that generates 'random' images was intelligently designed to achieve that very end, and is therefore productive, systematic, \n and teleological.\n\n \n Oh, not this again. It's a simulation of a random process, WW, just like a simulated car crash is an intentional simulation of an unintentional event. It doesn't invalidate the accuracy of the simulation. If you think it does, explain how its output differs from a 'valid' simulation.\n \n \nIt is not \"random\", except in some very loose sense of that word, one meaning, 'effects not exactly or precisely pre-determined, but only generally so'.\n\n \n The fact that every possible event the universe could support is not available within the simulation does not make it less stochastic. \n \n Genes are exposed to a fairly narrow gamut of external influences in their day-to-day operation. They aren't perpetually exposed to an unlimited degree of energetic bombardment or toxins. If they were, as you effectively demand simulations expose test subjects to in order to qualify as 'random', they would be instantly annihilated, organismic response or no. \n \n Therefore, there's nothing unfair or invalid about maintaining an equivalently restricted degree of random interference when running an evolutionary simulation. It doesn't make the interference less stochastic, or any more directed towards a goal. The goal of a simulation is to see what happens, and in the case of an evolutionary simulation it's to see what happens when you randomly perturb something and then filter out the 'worst' results.\n \n To everyone's tremendous surprise, you end up with variants on the best, and then variants on the best of those variants, and so forth, and precisely none of the hundreds of thousands of words you must have expended on this subject have ever made the least headway towards showing why that wouldn't apply to genes.\n \n \nJust like the options/responses organisms turn up heuristicly when stimulated to do so by some chronic, vital, environmental novelty. Both rely on the intelligence and volition of the organism that initiates the process.\n\n \n As I've shown umpteen times now, the organism doesn't initiate the process, and mutations occur equally well prior to any 'chronic, vital, environmental novelty'. Doesn't it make you feel just a little bit ashamed that you keep going back to saying 'mutation is a response to stimulus', when over and over again I've shown, and you've been forced to agree with, situations where it can't be? \n \n I've provided link after link showing evolution in the absence of the 'hypermutational response' you insist is necessary, and you've never even acknowledged that fact. And the 'hypermutational response' itself? A 'hyper-bad error correction routine', allowing externally induced, stochastic mutations to hang around in the blind hope they'll do some good.\n \n \nSecondly, comparing peeling's artificial selection, aka, 'breeding', of the images heuristically produced in his program, until he intelligently and volitionally gets the effect that he has been seeking, is not 'natural selection' at all, but the human activity to which darwin drew a false analogy.\n\n \n I just simulated the effect of better and better camouflage on the senses of a predator, by 'eating' those variants that least reminded me of a snake. Who ever said NS had no systematic, volitional component - ie, the predilictions and choices of other organisms in the environment? Not me; I've gone out of my way to describe ways in which the actions of organisms can influence the course of evolution. You're still battling your strawman, WW.\n \n Hey, I just realised: that makes the ToE an intentional process, doesn't it? After all, if a simulation of random mutation and filtering is 'teleological and volitional and systematic' just because someone set it up on purpose, then the ToE is 'teleological and volitional and systematic', because it incorporates the activity of organisms into the selection process. Cool! Looks like EAM just lost its USP :)\n \n \nWhat it really is is the 'feedback' portion of Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis, in which the organism selects its own goal, and shapes its own self, \n\n \n Romantic and misleading. Random change - even intentionally induced - cannot be inferred to be in service of any particular goal other than to change. If I take the number 10, randomly vary it and end up with the number 9, can you tell if I'm trying to get higher numbers or lower ones? No. The fact some external filter might be culling low numbers is irrelevant; to extend the analogy to evolution, organisms have no way of knowing whether 'high' or 'low', or even 'same' would be better anyway.\n \n And if I'm not even the one varying the number, if external influences are jittering it, what the heck does it matter that my goal is to 'survive, thrive and reproduce'? I'm not inducing the change and I have no way of knowing what kind of change would be helpful anyway. Go EAM!\n \n \nActually, it's no better than a load of hypothetical yadayadayada that bears no relation to the reality of the actual world of organisms. It is strictly to do with the abstract world of bean-counting, with no relation whatsoever to empirical biology.\n\n \n Ok, WW, I think that's about enough of that. I'm tired of these witless vitriolic belches that you seem to think are an apt substitute for polite debate. The reality is, you have no answer to this point. You can't deny the logic, so you pooh-pooh its significance. You're acting boorishly; get your act together and treat me with some respect.\n \n \nThe fact is that traits having to do with camouflage, and especially, mimicry, simply cannot develop gradually, and cumulatively, and coincidentally,\n\n \n An assertion is not proof. I just provided a link to some 'camouflage' that did develop gradually and cumulatively - and at each stage, the existence in the pool of variants of something that looked a bit more like a snake's head was an unintentional, accidental coincidence. My selection of it was not, but then again, a predator's selection of the least camouflaged is not a coincidence either. I never said NS was undirectional, or that organisms had no volitional/systematic say in it. Only that they don't get to direct mutations.\n \n \nGoing all the way back to their 'peppered moth', there is no empirical evidence whatsoever to the effect that 'natural selection', in the form of 'bird predation' drove the camouflaging colour adaptation in the population.\n\n \n No; variant alleles are the origin of the potential variation in colour; natural selection in the form of predation is the empirically observed explanation for why the numbers of moths possessing each variant changes over time. That in turn makes it progressively more likely that those variants will breed together and yield - depending on the precise mechanism of the genes involved in the colouration - a range of offspring that are on average equally or possibly even more strongly coloured.\n \n \nRather, everything points directly to an internal ability in insects, fish, and reptiles {EAM} to deliberately and volitionally alter their own appearance for puposes of camouflage/mimicry.\n\n \n Hmm. Funny how you make these great, sweeping statements about how insects, fish and reptiles can do these amazing things, and yet when pressed you scurry all the way back down to 'mutations may be stochastic wrt a stimulus, but they're happening on purpose and you can't prove they aren't.'\n \n \n \nThe problem is, you're imagining the hardest possible way in which a caterpillar could possibly have changed to look like a snake, and then saying 'evolution couldn't have done that'. What you need to do is question your assumptions.\n \n **\n Haw! The irony in this pompous pronouncement is breath-taking!!\n\n \n Though evidently it can be surpassed by some considerable margin.\n \n \nAnd if these sorts of rationalizations sound credible and plausible to you, then I've got a fleet of used cars and some 'waterfront property' in Florida that you may be interested in buying into, as well.\n\n \n Like I said, get your act together and treat other people with a bit of respect; you've had enough chances now.",

   "Jim\n To expand on what Kronus said, here are some examples of the sorts of things that could undergo positive selection because they made a difference to reproductive success. We'll start with the obvious and move onto some less obvious things, and I'm just going to talk about animals, as opposed to plants).\n \n Better camouflage, thereby avoiding being eaten\n Faster, ditto\n Better active and passive defensive features, ditto (tusks, spines, shell, poison, sight, hearing, smell, etc.)\n \n Better abilities at finding / gathering / catching your own food (faster, better eyesight or smell, etc.) (specialization in feeding strategy)\n \n Better resistance to disease or to parasites\n Broadening of dietary possibilities (this conflicts with the specialization mentioned above, but which strategy works better will depend on circumstances)\n Getting bigger (better able to resist predators & compete against other members of the species)\n Getting smaller (better able to hide from predators / better able to get prey that's hiding in small spaces)\n \n Having more young (so more of them survive, or at least if survivial is unlikely and simply random luck then there's a better chance of at least one or two making it through the gauntlet).\n \n Having fewer young, if that allows you to concentrate resources and thus create a higher quality infant that will therefore be better set to compete with other individuals in its generation. (This is the best strategy if infant survival is pretty likely, as in humans and elephants.)\n \n Being even more attractive to potential mates (this explains peacock tails, bower bird behavior, and possibly sizable butts and breasts in human females).\n \n Better able to fight other males in order to win a harem (for some animals, anyway)\n \n Note that a lot of things can work either way, depending on circumstances. That's partly why life is so variable.\n \n Most of the above sounds like natural selection should lead mostly to bigger, stronger, better, & more babies, but there's a huge selective pressure in the other direction, favoring a better ability to survive droughts and famines. Even those these need not happen every generation, they are crucial episodes, because up to 90-99% of the population may die. Survival generally requires small size and simpler structures, because small and simple bodies (down to mouse size at least) require fewer calories and less water. If we run short of money one month we may be able to get a loan from someone. Animals on the other hand don't have credit: a body will require a basic minimum energy input each month, and if you fall short, quite simply, you die.\n \n Using resources more economically can be very rewarding here, so efficiency can also be selected for.\n \n It's not just carnivores, or survival.",

You said so just the other day:\n \n \n Quote:\n Darwinists argue that any degree of mimicry/camouflage is, [as they say about eyesight and every other trait], significantly effective and adaptively advantageous, no matter how slight, and that all such traits arise intially by the spontaneous generation of random, accidental, genetic alteration, or what they call, 'mutation', and increase accumulatively by the addition of more such accidental but fortuitous alterations, i.e., 'mutations', over ensuing generations. \n \n \n This was in response to a post in which I said that mimicry doesn't need to start being a selective benefit at 1%, and explained why. Moreover I don't say that all traits arise by mutation, random or otherwise, nor that they are all amplified by further mutations. So go on, WW, call me a liar again - or retract your claim.\n\n \n **\n Since you insist that you are not a darwinist, i.e., a person of the materiaolist/mechanist metaphysic who believes that all of reality can be redced to something that 'just happens, that's all', please demonstrate where and how your metaphysic allows for teleology and purpose in reality.\n \n Then explain why it is that you fight tooth and nail to rationalize away any possibility that intelligence/volition play a real role in biological evolution, whereas you defend and rationalize the darwinist notion of stochastic genetic accident at every opportunity.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n First, the program that generates 'random' images was intelligently designed to achieve that very end, and is therefore productive, systematic, \n and teleological. \n \n \n Oh, not this again. It's a simulation of a random process, WW, just like a simulated car crash is an intentional simulation of an unintentional event. It doesn't invalidate the accuracy of the simulation. If you think it does, explain how its output differs from a 'valid' simulation.\n\n \n **\n I never said that it invalidated anything but your implied parallel with RMNS evolution. I do not give a hoot about simulations. They are very useful devices. What I do care about is false analogies from heuristic computer simulations to darwinian biological notions.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n It is not \"random\", except in some very loose sense of that word, one meaning, 'effects not exactly or precisely pre-determined, but only generally so'. \n \n \n The fact that every possible event the universe could support is not available within the simulation does not make it less stochastic.\n\n \n **\n Not true. Every limitation placed upon a stochastic process makes that process less stochastic and more systematic. Flipping a coin is a stochastic process where the stochastic element is minimal, 50/50, +/-, yes/no, whatever. The most stochastic event would be 1/near infinity. Stochasticity/chance is a function of probability, and probability can be, and always is, variable plus or minus, more or less.\n \n \n\n Genes are exposed to a fairly narrow gamut of external influences in their day-to-day operation. They aren't perpetually exposed to an unlimited degree of energetic bombardment or toxins. If they were, as you effectively demand simulations expose test subjects to in order to qualify as 'random', they would be instantly annihilated, organismic response or no. \n\n \n **\n Any computer simulation, to be truthfully analogous to the natural process it supposedly stands in for, must accurately represent the fundamental mechanisms ascribed to that natural process. I do not \"demand\" anything, except that any simulated process be truthfully analogous to any natural process that its designers claim that it represents a valid analogy for. If you feel that this simulation does not mirror nature, then that's your problem, not mine. You brought up this example, so if you now think it irrelevent, why did you introduce it?\n \n \n\n Therefore, there's nothing unfair or invalid about maintaining an equivalently restricted degree of random interference when running an evolutionary simulation.\n\n \n **\n Nonsense. Of course there is. The amount of restriction on the degree of 'interference', aka, 'deliberate direction' is unfair, invalid, and downright dishonest when it differs substantially from the natural events in the biological evolution for which it is promoted as an analogous computer 'simulation'. If the sim does not mirror the phenomenon in its basic fundamentals, then claiming that they are analogous is a lie.\n \n And if you did not intend your sim as a theoretical support for your RMNS darwinian mechanism for evolution, why then did you bring it in at all? As theoretical support for EAM. It certainly is that, since the analogy is perfect, and for that, I thank you.\n \n \n\n It doesn't make the interference less stochastic, or any more directed towards a goal.\n\n \n **\n Breath-takingly absurd.\n \n \n\n The goal of a simulation is to see what happens, and in the case of an evolutionary simulation it's to see what happens when you randomly perturb something and then filter out the 'worst' results.\n\n \n **\n Apart from everything else, the darwinian RMNS model has neither goals nor directions--only environmental stuff that happens, randomly, but which darwinists falsely pretend is regular, predictable, mechanical, and non-random.\n \n So as soon as you introduce goals, and thus, direction, to your simulation, you turn your back on the very darwinian notion that you are trying to support. And that is either rank stupidity or a foul deception foisted upon the public.\n \n \n\n To everyone's tremendous surprise, you end up with variants on the best, and then variants on the best of those variants, and so forth, and precisely none of the hundreds of thousands of words you must have expended on this subject have ever made the least headway towards showing why that wouldn't apply to genes.\n\n \n **\n Can't be done, so long as darwinists lie to the public and say that their EAM-based heuristic/teleological evolutionary simulations are RMNS-based 'stochastic/chance + coincidence' evolutionary simulations.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Just like the options/responses organisms turn up heuristicly when stimulated to do so by some chronic, vital, environmental novelty. Both rely on the intelligence and volition of the organism that initiates the process. \n \n \n As I've shown umpteen times now, the organism doesn't initiate the process,\n\n \n **\n You have never, ever, done any such thing. If you truly believe that you have done so, then you are deluding yourself.\n \n \n\n and mutations occur equally well prior to any 'chronic, vital, environmental novelty'.\n\n \n **\n \"Mutations\" occur all the time. That's irrelevent, and I've never bothered to quarrel with a fact. The issue is how adaptive mutations are generated, not when random mutations are generated. Adaptive genetic mutations do not originate accidentally, prior to an original environmental stimulus, and you have totally failed to demonstrate otherwise.\n \n \n\n Doesn't it make you feel just a little bit ashamed that you keep going back to saying 'mutation is a response to stimulus', when over and over again I've shown, and you've been forced to agree with, situations where it can't be? \n\n \n **\n Doesn't it make you at least a little bit ashamed to be flagrantly dishonest about what really took place in our exchanges?!?\n \n \n\n I've provided link after link showing evolution in the absence of the 'hypermutational response' you insist is necessary,\n\n \n **\n More misdirection. I claimed only that hypermutation, particularly in eusocial organisms such as bacteria colonies, was one mechanism by which novel mutations to novel environmental stimuli were generated. I did not say, as you claim here, that hypermutation is necessary to any kind of origins. To the contrary, EAM maintains that in most cases organismic evolution precedes genetic mutation, and in those cases no hypermutation is entailed at all.\n \n \n\n and you've never even acknowledged that fact.\n\n \n **\n Why in the world would I \"acknowledge\" a dishonest distortion made by you, as an truthful description of what I claim?\n \n \n\n And the 'hypermutational response' itself? A 'hyper-bad error correction routine', allowing externally induced, stochastic mutations to hang around in the blind hope they'll do some good.\n\n \n \n **\n That's your characterization, but even if at all accurate, desperate times call for desperate measures, as any intelligent organism knows.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Secondly, comparing peeling's artificial selection, aka, 'breeding', of the images heuristically produced in his program, until he intelligently and volitionally gets the effect that he has been seeking, is not 'natural selection' at all, but the human activity to which darwin drew a false analogy. \n \n \n I just simulated the effect of better and better camouflage on the senses of a predator, by 'eating' those variants that least reminded me of a snake. Who ever said NS had no systematic, volitional component -\n\n \n **\n Uhm, every darwinist whose opinions I've ever read, that's who.\n \n \n\n ie, the predilictions and choices of other organisms in the environment?\n\n \n **\n Oh, please. Since when is the abstract notion, \"NS\", tied to the intelligence and volition of 'other organisms' in the environment. None of which, as per the materialism/mechanism on which darwinism depends, has any such thing a intelligence/volition in the first place. You cannot escape the fact that if you attribute intelligence/volition to one organism, then you cannot rationally deny it to all organisms, including evolving organisms, and worse, once you admit to the dynamic intelligence/volition of EAM, the inert, passive random selection model that depends upon accident and coincidence collapses like a leaky balloon. \n \n \n \n\n Not me; I've gone out of my way to describe ways in which the actions of organisms can influence the course of evolution. You're still battling your strawman, WW.\n\n \n **\n Wrong. What's really happening is that you are still battling your cognitive dissonance, peeling.\n \n \n\n Hey, I just realised: that makes the ToE an intentional process, doesn't it?\n\n \n No, it doesn't make darwinism an intentional process. \n If it did the all the evangelical atheists who promote darwinism as support for their religion would become so enraged at you that they might burn you at the stake.\n \n Aftyer all, it is simply because I assert that evolution is an intentional process that these religious fanatics all hate my guts in these forums.\n \n \n\n After all, if a simulation of random mutation and filtering is 'teleological and volitional and systematic' just because someone set it up on purpose, then the ToE is 'teleological and volitional and systematic', because it incorporates the activity of organisms into the selection process.\n\n \n **\n Trouble for you, if the sim requires an intelligent designer/selecter, then so does evolution, by your reasoning; -- but your \"ToE\" exists mostly as a bulwark against, and a rebuke to, that very postulate.\n \n \n\n Cool! Looks like EAM just lost its USP \n\n \n **\n Nope. Darwinism did.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n What it really is is the 'feedback' portion of Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis, in which the organism selects its own goal, and shapes its own self, \n \n \n Romantic and misleading. Random change - even intentionally induced - cannot be inferred to be in service of any particular goal other than to change.\n\n \n **\n Tell that to yourself next time you flip a coin, roll a die, or ask for a card.\n \n \n\n If I take the number 10, randomly vary it and end up with the number 9, can you tell if I'm trying to get higher numbers or lower ones? No.\n\n \n **\n True, and that is what is meant by a stochastic activity. On the other hand if I know that higher [or lower] numbers are desirable, that is a heuristic process.\n \n \n\n The fact some external filter might be culling low numbers is irrelevant;\n\n \n **\n The knowledge that \"some external filter [is] culling low numbers\" is altogether relevent to an heuristic responsive process, but not, of course, to a stochastic selective process. But why should anyone adopt your supposition that evolution is a stochastic selective process?\n \n \n \n\n to extend the analogy to evolution, organisms have no way of knowing whether 'high' or 'low', or even 'same' would be better anyway.\n\n \n **\n Haw! Like heck they don't!!\n \n \n\n And if I'm not even the one varying the number, if external influences are jittering it, what the heck does it matter that my goal is to 'survive, thrive and reproduce'? \n\n \n **\n You confusing yourself. External influences don't 'jitter' the numbers--they were already random, according to your notion. However external factors [ns] can decide whether they want high or low, or low now, high later, etc.\n That's also random. So under RMNS goals and the dynamic striving to achieve them have no place. They are dismissed as 'supernatural', or something.\n \n Under EAM the 'numbers' are not randomly generated, but are intelligently and volitionally selected, based upon information about 'external influences'. And the entire system is a matter of striving to fufil those life goals.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n The fact is that traits having to do with camouflage, and especially, mimicry, simply cannot develop gradually, and cumulatively, and coincidentally, \n \n \n An assertion is not proof. \n\n \n **\n Right back atcha, and since you made the claim that such things are not only possible, but the fact of the matter, the onus is on you to supply proof for you darwinist assertion. Until you do that, I need do no more than gainsay your claim.\n \n \n\n I just provided a link to some 'camouflage' that did develop gradually and cumulatively - and at each stage, the existence in the pool of variants of something that looked a bit more like a snake's head was an unintentional, accidental coincidence.\n\n \n **\n Good god, you never did any such thing!! All you did was hypothesize a 'just-so' story. Not a speck of empirical evidence anywhere.\n \n \n\n My selection of it was not, but then again, a predator's selection of the least camouflaged is not a coincidence either. \n\n \n **\n Nobody has denied the 'survival value' of camouflage and mimicry. They are facts of nature. The issue is the mechanism by which they originate. You say lucky accident, I say organismic dynamics.\n \n \n\n I never said NS was undirectional,\n\n \n **\n No, darwinists always say that \"NS\" is 'mechanical', which implies directional. Their problem is that they cannot show how the random events of the environment, coupled coincidentally with the random events of genetic inheritance, could ever even possibly generate a 'mechanism' with the regularity necessary to 'direction'.\n \n \n\n or that organisms had no volitional/systematic say in it.\n\n \n **\n As above, you let the \"volitional/systematic\" get a foot in the front door, then wartch RMNS having to run out the back. \n \n \n\n Only that they don't get to direct mutations.\n\n \n **\n But there you are wrong. They do direct adaptive mutations, directly or obliquely.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Going all the way back to their 'peppered moth', there is no empirical evidence whatsoever to the effect that 'natural selection', in the form of 'bird predation' drove the camouflaging colour adaptation in the population. \n \n \n No; variant alleles are the origin of the potential variation in colour; natural selection in the form of predation is the empirically observed explanation\n\n \n **\n Nuts. That's the darwinist speculation. There is no empirical evidence that immediately experienced bird predation had a thing to do with anything. The fact that moths are nocturnal and bird predators are diurnal flatly contradicts that 'ns' assumption on its face.\n \n \n \n Quote:\n Rather, everything points directly to an internal ability in insects, fish, and reptiles {EAM} to deliberately and volitionally alter their own appearance for puposes of camouflage/mimicry. \n \n \n Hmm. Funny how you make these great, sweeping statements about how insects, fish and reptiles can do these amazing things, and yet when pressed you scurry all the way back down to 'mutations may be stochastic wrt a stimulus, but they're happening on purpose and you can't prove they aren't.'\n\n \n \n **\n Hmm, funny how you can tell such whoppers without blushing.",

   "Since you insist that you are not a darwinist, i.e., a person of the materiaolist/mechanist metaphysic who believes that all of reality can be redced to something that 'just happens, that's all', please demonstrate where and how your metaphysic allows for teleology and purpose in reality.\n\n \n You're missing the point. You called me a darwinist, yet you've made several contradictory statements about what 'darwinists say' and 'darwinists do' and what 'darwinists are forced by their materialist philisophy to claim'. You're wrong about something, WW; what do you want it to be?\n \n \nNot true. Every limitation placed upon a stochastic process makes that process less stochastic and more systematic.\n\n \n You need to brush up on your understanding of the term stochastic.\n \n The relevance of the simulation is that undirected random change gave rise to a progressively more 'snake-like' image, despite there being no intelligence or intent on the part of the image that was being mutated. It was linked in response to a doubt Jim expressed. Is it a simulation of genes? No, but they do exist.\n \n \n\"Mutations\" occur all the time. That's irrelevent, and I've never bothered to quarrel with a fact. The issue is how adaptive mutations are generated, not when random mutations are generated.\n\n \n Tell you what, you answer the question you've always dodged, and I'll take this point more seriously:\n \n How are random mutations supposed to avoid being adaptive?\n \n This forum is chock full of links to adaptive mutations that are nothing more than a single point mutation - N. Wells recently provided an excellent example which included several. So please, WW, in your own time, explain why a point mutation known to occur prior to exposure to a selective environment could not have been one of the 'random' (in your lexicon 'unintentional') mutations you agree occur all the time.\n \n Please don't try to turn this around and ask me for proof that it was accidental. You are the one saying that accidental mutations do happen, but such-and-such mutation absolutely could not have been one of them. Explain why it could not.\n \n \nMore misdirection. I claimed only that hypermutation, particularly in eusocial organisms such as bacteria colonies, was one mechanism by which novel mutations to novel environmental stimuli were generated.\n\n \n I see you scribed Expeditious Retreat into your spellbook this morning :)\n \n Ok, so if that's not the organismic response we're looking for, please, enlighten me as to what is.\n \n \nWhy in the world would I \"acknowledge\" a dishonest distortion made by you, as an truthful description of what I claim?\n\n \n You've never mentioned any other organismic responses relating to mutation, never implied that you had any others in mind. Silly me for making the 'unfounded assumption' that you didn't have others. So ok, what are they?\n \n \nThat's your characterization, but even if at all accurate, desperate times call for desperate measures, as any intelligent organism knows.\n\n \n Interesting; you admit that the hypermutational response looks very much like it's just doing a slightly worse job of correcting random mutations. \n \n The unavoidable implication is, therefore, that the random mutations themselves are a potential source of helpful mutation. And since we've just agreed (again) they happen all the time, we have a simple explanation for how helpful mutations can arise prior to a selective environment, an explanation which doesn't involve organisms 'remembering' earlier mutations from the ether (whilst being inexplicably incapable of remembering what they were useful for).\n \n \nYou cannot escape the fact that if you attribute intelligence/volition to one organism, then you cannot rationally deny it to all organisms, including evolving organisms,\n\n \n I think you might struggle to detect 'volition' in a bacterium, but that's all really beside the point. Saying that an organism wants to survive, thrive and reproduce is one thing; listing the mechanisms that are under its control in pursuit of that goal is quite another.\n \n \nTrouble for you, if the sim requires an intelligent designer/selecter, then so does evolution, by your reasoning;\n\n \n No, WW, by your reasoning. I'm not the one saying that intentional simulations aren't valid for mimicking accidental events. We can simulate an asteroid smashing into the earth; doesn't mean it could only happen if someone threw it.\n \n \nTrue, and that is what is meant by a stochastic activity. On the other hand if I know that higher [or lower] numbers are desirable, that is a heuristic process.\n\n \n You can 'know' anything you like, but if you cannot direct the random variation, and external factors beyond your control determine whether the outcome is helpful or not, you aren't performing a heuristic. You cannot 'heuristically' win the lottery.\n \n Note: in case you're thinking a lottery isn't the same because you don't know the winning number in advance of the draw, think about this: you do know in advance of the draw which number will mean a win for you, but you're dependent on a random process to match that number. That's exactly analogous to an organism somehow 'knowing' what variation would help it but being dependent upon random mutation to induce it.\n \n \nHowever external factors [ns] can decide whether they want high or low, or low now, high later, etc. That's also random. So under RMNS goals and the dynamic striving to achieve them have no place. They are dismissed as 'supernatural', or something.\n\n \n Nope; as I've said over and over again, organismic pursuit of goals has a place, it's just not at the mutation end of things. An organism can, to varying degrees, influence the selective pressures upon it by migrating, modifying its behaviour - basically making the most of its phenotype. It can indirectly influence the genotype of its offspring by selecting a mate. But there's no evidence that the mutations that perturb the genome are under its direction or control.\n \n \nTheir problem is that they cannot show how the random events of the environment, coupled coincidentally with the random events of genetic inheritance, could ever even possibly generate a 'mechanism' with the regularity necessary to 'direction'.\n\n \n Is the environment usually stable enough for the same qualities to remain useful over many generations? Yes. When it isn't, when it changes too drastically and exceeds the existing scope of variation within a population, the population either becomes extinct, or must migrate or adapt its behaviour in some other way. Either way, the environment has just influenced the scope of future evolution.\n \n \nThey do direct adaptive mutations, directly or obliquely.\n\n \n Evidence?\n \n \nNuts. That's the darwinist speculation. There is no empirical evidence that immediately experienced bird predation had a thing to do with anything. The fact that moths are nocturnal and bird predators are diurnal flatly contradicts that 'ns' assumption on its face.\n\n \n I can't wait to see how you get out of this without admitting you made a mistake :)\n \n First, the peppered moth predation selection hypothesis was recently retested and confirmed by careful empirical observation over a period of seven years.\n \n Second, the peppered moth's camouflage benefits it while it is at rest during the day. You know, when the birds are up and about, and there's light for them to see moths by? :)\n \n C'mon, you have to admit: that's pretty funny.",

You defend darwinism tooth and nail, yet say you are no darwinist. So if not a darwinist, then what?\n \n I have this habit, you see. Whenever a waterbird looks like a duck, waddles like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then I always seem to call such birds, ducks. If someone tells me, \"That's not a duck!\", I don't just take their word for it.\n \n \n\n You called me a darwinist, yet you've made several contradictory statements about what 'darwinists say' and 'darwinists do' and what 'darwinists are forced by their materialist philisophy to claim'. \n\n \n **\n Like heck I have!! Show us where that ever happened!!\n \n \n \n\n You're wrong about something, WW; what do you want it to be?\n\n \n **\n No doubt I've been wrong about a lot of things at one time or another-mostly about people--but I'm not wrong about anything you've referred to.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Not true. Every limitation placed upon a stochastic process makes that process less stochastic and more systematic. \n \n \n You need to brush up on your understanding of the term stochastic.\n\n \n **\n I do?!? Haw! You are trying to claim that 'stochastic' is an absolute, that is, that it is an 'all or nothing' proposition, that an event is entirely stochastic or it's not at all stochastic. Nothing relative allowed. That's ridiculous. \n \n The same for determinism. You can claim that determinism is an absolute. Mechanist/Materialists insist that it is; that is, that every event is pre-determined, mechanically, by every event that preceded it. The understanding introduced by quantum mechanics, to the effect that in reality that just ain't so, is an abomination in the eyes of their religion. The idea of a reality that is only partially determined, and partially indeterminate, drives them crazy, even though that appears to be very much the fact of matter.\n \n \"Stochastic\", for such people, was simply a 'place-holder' 'word of convenience', an 'unreal' abstraction in a wholly determined reality in which prediction was only limited by ignorance of the chain of causation, and not by a fact of ontology, i.e., quantum reality. But even there 'stochastic' was a relative term, and was relative dependent upon degree of knowledge and understanding of the pertinent chain of mechanical causation. So I have no idea where your assertion that 'stochastic' is an absolute condition that cannot be modified, increased or decreased, comes from.\n \n \n \n\n The relevance of the simulation is that undirected random change gave rise to a progressively more 'snake-like' image,\n\n \n **\n Except that, being artificial, i.e., wifully and intelligently designed to produce exactly what it does produce, it is not at all the \"undirected random change\" that you're trying to spin it as. Even less so when 'feed-back' based upon a value system based upon a desired outcome was the sole and only reason thing that \" gave rise to a progressively more 'snake-like' image\". You can't have it every way you want it. Either the above is true, as per EAM, or darwinism's assertion that particles of acid banged around in a genome produced stochastically distributed colour spots on a worms' tails that, for some strange reason, proved less appealing to predators in one configuration than in another, despite not resembling anything at all, so that, by some magic, the stochastically distributed spots stopped being generated stochastically, or at least, less stochastically, and began to be limited by genetic determinism, so that the predators finally began to see a pattern, a design forming, that to them very much looked like a snake of some kind, despite the tendency of genetic determinis to keep everyrandomly generatedset of spots unchanged, and random mutation fighting to change every set of spots with every generation, and a lot of predators who saw nothing resembling anything much but a coloured worm, in any case.\n \n So how about this. Get an easel, some canvas, some brushes, some oil paints, and some paint remover, and a lot of rags. Also get a a gang of helpers, who have been told that, with their 'natural selection', you want to paint a picture of 'something' you haven't seen, blindfolded. They choose a large photograph of something or someone, you pick up your brush, dip it in some unknown pigment, and make a stroke or a daub or splat on the canvas.\n If any of you helpers thinks that won't help you get to the image on the photos, they can rush over with their rag and wipe it off. Then you can randomly dip your brush and do the daub thing all over again. Either you crew will say, alright, that's right for the photo, or someone will rush over and quickly wipe it off, and on it goes. You should have a decent facsimile of the photo, provided it's not 'too' complex, in about, oh, say, a trillion years.\n \n But here you expect a worm with no 'brain', and certainly no idea what its hind end looks like, to pull off that trick by RMNS within a few generations. These worms must have started the job at about the same time as the \"Big Bang\", doncha thinK?!?. How else could they have gotten so close to a significant, meaningful message, unintentionally, in any less time?\n \n This RMNS stuff is just so silly.\n \n \n \n\n despite there being no intelligence or intent on the part of the image that was being mutated. It was linked in response to a doubt Jim expressed. Is it a simulation of genes? No, but they do exist.\n\n \n **\n Intelligence does not have to reside than which is mutated, but only in that which is doing the mutating;-- and even at that, only if and when an adaptive mutation is involved.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n \"Mutations\" occur all the time. That's irrelevent, and I've never bothered to quarrel with a fact. The issue is how adaptive mutations are generated, not when random mutations are generated. \n \n \n Tell you what, you answer the question you've always dodged, and I'll take this point more seriously:\n \n How are random mutations supposed to avoid being adaptive?\n\n \n **\n Simply by being themselves. As I've told you at least 100 times, random mutations are inherently and intrinsically lacking in those properties which generate adaptation and organismic productivity--i.e., intelligence and volition. Without these qualities in control, every mutation is merely entropic.\n \n Nothing can originate, unaided, that which it does not itself possess. No mass of molecules can generate an original adaptive DNA message, all by itself, or unintentionally, by some entropic act of destruction. \"Ex nihilo, ab nihilo, nihil fit.\" Why is something so plain and obvious something you simply cannot accept as fact?!? Could it be due to a denied, even sublimated, materialist/mechanist/darwinist metaphysic?\n \n \n\n This forum is chock full of links to adaptive mutations that are nothing more than a single point mutation - N. Wells recently provided an excellent example which included several.\n\n \n **\n So what? Just like L&D'43, Lederberg & Lederberg '52, your stuff about gene duplication and gene magnification, every damn thi9ng you guys dredge up and presumptively call 'random', turns out to be systematic and non-random.\n Who cares if they are simple one to one 'point mutations'? If they aren't random accidents caused by a mutagen or _accidental_ copying \"error\"--and although darwinists can't accept it, just because a copy is inexact does not mean that it was just an entropic error-such things are often systematic/intentional. Ask any computer nerd. Darwinist examples of adaptive random mutations always turn out to be nothing but a self-serving rush to judgement based upon an empirically and logically unsupported 'a priori' assumption. If anyone needed a good reason to dismiss such a speculative presumption, apart from the logic of the 'ex nihilo', s/he would only have to ask, why, if this is a general rule, have darwinist failed to come up with a million unequical example, instead of 4/5 dubious anomalies, and even those pathetic few based on assumptions, not empirical observation and validation by prediction?!?\n \n \n\n So please, WW, in your own time, explain why a point mutation known to occur prior to exposure to a selective environment could not have been one of the 'random' (in your lexicon 'unintentional') mutations you agree occur all the time.\n\n \n **\n Whenever you mean or imply, \"adaptive\", wrt your \"point mutation\", I've been there, done that,already. As you well know, since I did it to the last few would-be examples that you yourself presented. Non-adaptive point mutations can happen as and when they please, since they are irrelevent to any objective, meaningful definition of evolution.\n \n \n\n Please don't try to turn this around and ask me for proof that it was accidental. You are the one saying that accidental mutations do happen, but such-and-such mutation absolutely could not have been one of them. Explain why it could not.\n\n \n **\n See above, for the umpteenth time.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n More misdirection. I claimed only that hypermutation, particularly in eusocial organisms such as bacteria colonies, was one mechanism by which novel mutations to novel environmental stimuli were generated. \n \n \n I see you scribed Expeditious Retreat into your spellbook this morning\n\n \n **\n And you scribed 'horsesh-t'.\n \n \n\n Ok, so if that's not the organismic response we're looking for, please, enlighten me as to what is.\n\n \n **\n It's one of them. So is developmentalism, aka, devo-evo. So is epigenetic mutation and inheritance. More I can't think of right now. They all fall under the general heading, \"Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis\", or, \"EAM\".\n \n Here's a question for you--since when has science accepted random and non-mechanical explanations of anything, [such as your \"RMNS\" explanation for the origins of adaptive bioform and behavioural change (evolution)], as if such stuff constituted a legitimate 'mechanism' (as that word is defined by science)? \n Shall I tell you since when? Ever since some 19th century atheists abandoned the principle of emprical science and started dictating to biology that it could only be that which their own particular materialist/mechanist metaphysical assumptions allowed it to be. A secular re-birth of the very medieval scholasticism that empirical science was supposed to have abolished. Hey, thanks to that, you guys have even resurrected medieval notions of 'spontaneous generation' and the magick of 'emergence'.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Why in the world would I \"acknowledge\" a dishonest distortion made by you, as an truthful description of what I claim? \n \n \n You've never mentioned any other organismic responses relating to mutation, never implied that you had any others in mind.Silly me for making the 'unfounded assumption' that you didn't have others. So ok, what are they?\n\n \n **\n See above. Others to come as they arise. WRT eusocial bacteria, see 'quorum sensing', 'revertant mutation', 'cellular intelligence', 'collective intelligence', etc. All of which I have already spoken to you about. \n \n [quote\n Quote:\n That's your characterization, but even if at all accurate, desperate times call for desperate measures, as any intelligent organism knows. \n \n \n Interesting; you admit that the hypermutational response looks very much like it's just doing a slightly worse job of correcting random mutations.[/quote]\n \n **\n Not hardly!! In hypermutation, not only is there no 'slightly' about control and correction, as well the actual generation of 'different' material is robust. A perfect example of the heuristic mechanism of 'brain-storming', where new ideas are rapidly and copiously generated, while at the same time criticism and inhibition are drastically reduced. A very intelligent and productive problem-solving system.\n \n \n\n The unavoidable implication is, therefore, that the random mutations themselves are a potential source of helpful mutation.\n\n \n **\n Only if your definition of 'random' is incapable of making the distinction between accidental/stochastic and intentional/heuristic. All materialist/ mechanist definitions are so handicapped, metaphysically.\n \n \n \n\n And since we've just agreed (again) they happen all the time, we have a simple explanation for how helpful mutations can arise prior to a selective environment, an explanation which doesn't involve organisms 'remembering' earlier mutations from the ether (whilst being inexplicably incapable of remembering what they were useful for).\n\n \n **\n I have no idea where you dreampt up this last snide trash, that which you falsely insinuate forms a part of EAM, but it is your self-contradictory darwinism that insists that useless or even harmful genetic mutations can be 'stored' for countless generations, in direct contradiction of both your own, \"Natural Selection\", and any law in physics on the subject of conservation of energy, in some sort of prevoyant expectation of coincidental adaptive benefit at some unknown future date.\n Duh.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n You cannot escape the fact that if you attribute intelligence/volition to one organism, then you cannot rationally deny it to all organisms, including evolving organisms, \n \n \n I think you might struggle to detect 'volition' in a bacterium, but that's all really beside the point. \n\n \n **\n Wrong. Volition in eusocial bacteria colonies is every bit as observable as voluntary behaviour everywhere else in biology. It's just that you darwinists, [whether you recognise this in yourself or not], automatically deny the reality of volition for metaphysical reasons. Even those of you you who have been dragged, kicking and screaming, to admit that volition and intelligence truly exist wrt human beings, still fight a rear-guard action by asserting that it doesn't exist in plants, bacteria, and other 'brainless' organisms. Old prejudices die hard.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Trouble for you, if the sim requires an intelligent designer/selecter, then so does evolution, by your reasoning; \n \n \n No, WW, by your reasoning. I'm not the one saying that intentional simulations aren't valid for mimicking accidental events.\n\n \n **\n Hey, I never said that they don't \"mimic\" events!! I did not even say that they were not analogous to actual processes. Where in the world do you get such strange misinterpretations?!? What I did say was that your heuristic sims 'mimic', 'are analogous to', EAM, not RMNS. IOW, your simulation simulated EAM; it did not simulate RMNS. Claiming otherwise is invalid.\n \n \n\n We can simulate an asteroid smashing into the earth; doesn't mean it could only happen if someone threw it.\n\n \n **\n This silliness comes of you misinterpreting my position. Are you doing it on purpose?\n \n \n Quote:\n True, and that is what is meant by a stochastic activity. On the other hand if I know that higher [or lower] numbers are desirable, that is a heuristic process. \n \n \n You can 'know' anything you like, but if you cannot direct the random variation, and external factors beyond your control determine whether the outcome is helpful or not, you aren't performing a heuristic.[/quote]\n \n **\n True. But your assumption is that there is no control and direction involved applies only to stochastic processes. Where any such control or direction is involved, it is an heuristic process.\n \n \n\n You cannot 'heuristically' win the lottery.\n\n \n **\n So they say. But some people skilled in probability theory seem to be luckier than those of us who play any old number without a 'system'. And you can win 'heuristically' at horse races and blackjack tables, --or so I'm told.\n \n \n\n Nope; as I've said over and over again, organismic pursuit of goals has a place, it's just not at the mutation end of things. An organism can, to varying degrees, influence the selective pressures upon it by migrating, modifying its behaviour - basically making the most of its phenotype. It can indirectly influence the genotype of its offspring by selecting a mate. But there's no evidence that the mutations that perturb the genome are under its direction or control.\n\n \n **\n Sigh. The evidence is everywhere. It's just that, for metaphysical reasons, you deny its existence.\n \n \n\n Is the environment usually stable enough for the same qualities to remain useful over many generations? Yes.\n\n \n **\n And does evolution proceed under those conditions? No. See, coelecanth, etc. etc. etc.\n \n But darwinism says that not only is mutation random and constant and unceasing, it says that evolution is random and constant and unceasing. Except that, darn it, it just isn't. Darwinism denies the fact of biological stasis.\n \n \n\n When it isn't, when it changes too drastically and exceeds the existing scope of variation within a population, the population either becomes extinct, or must migrate or adapt its behaviour in some other way. Either way, the environment has just influenced the scope of future evolution.\n\n \n **\n True. And EAM exactly. Morphological adaptation drives productive genetic mutation; not, as you people have it, accidental genetic mutation drives morphological adaptation.\n Quote:\n Nuts. That's the darwinist speculation. There is no empirical evidence that immediately experienced bird predation had a thing to do with anything.

I'd love to see it, because last I heard, your study still hadn't even been able to locate the nesting moths, no matter what their colour morph, so they could not possibly have actually seen birds finding and eating moths, let alone accumulated sufficient evidence to prove that birds ate significantly more of one morph than they did the other.\n \n \n\n C'mon, you have to admit: that's pretty funny.\n\n \n Well, it is funny, [but sad, too], how you guys present and swallow your own tendentious assumptions.

So if not a darwinist, then what?\n\n \n Oh, I can be a darwinist if you like; I really don't care. The problem is yours, not mine, WW; you keep saying I'm a darwinist, and then assigning opinions and statements to darwinists that directly contradict the things I say. So which are you wrong about?\n \n \nI do?!? Haw! You are trying to claim that 'stochastic' is an absolute, that is, that it is an 'all or nothing' proposition, that an event is entirely stochastic or it's not at all stochastic. Nothing relative allowed. That's ridiculous. \n\n \n Yes, it is, because that's not what I'm claiming. \n \n Stochastic refers to the pattern and bias - or rather the lack of them - in a random sequence. Restrictions on the range of numbers in a sequence does not make a pattern of them any more or less stochastic. Stochastic is indeed a sliding scale, but it doesn't vary based on the range of values explored. Like I said: brush up on your understanding of the term before making statements about it.\n \n \nExcept that, being artificial, i.e., wifully and intelligently designed to produce exactly what it does produce, \n\n \n But what the variation 'does produce' is not biased towards success; it is stochastic. Hence you have no grounds for inferring one goal over any other. Adaptive variants would still thrive and maladaptive ones still wouldn't regardless of the 'goal' or lack of one behind the variation. If you can demonstrate that such would not be the case, I invite you to do so.\n \n \nEither the above is true, as per EAM, or darwinism's assertion that particles of acid banged around in a genome produced stochastically distributed colour spots on a worms' tails that, for some strange reason, proved less appealing to predators in one configuration than in another, despite not resembling anything at all, so that, by some magic, the stochastically distributed spots stopped being generated stochastically, or at least, less stochastically,\n\n \n I'm just going to have to stop you there. The variation doesn't become any less stochastic. However, what it is now varying around are the most successful phenotypes from the previous generation. And the next generation will vary around the most successful again, and so forth.\n \n You seem to have it in your head that 'stochastic variation' of camouflage must be something akin to static on a de-tuned TV: endless and unrestricted variation which must somehow 'magically' turn up something like a snake head, which then 'magically' stops varying quite so much. I can understand how that would sound ridiculous, because it is - and it is not representative of evolutionary theory.\n \n \nThis RMNS stuff is just so silly.\n \n\n \n The version you have in mind is, absolutely :)\n \n \nSimply by being themselves. As I've told you at least 100 times, random mutations are inherently and intrinsically lacking in those properties which generate adaptation and organismic productivity--i.e., intelligence and volition. Without these qualities in control, every mutation is merely entropic.\n\n \n Ah, the famous 'universal principle'. So that's your explanation for why this nucleotide is susceptible to random mutation, and this one and this one, but not that one in the middle? That RM wouldn't 'dare' change that nucleotide because it would be adaptive?\n \n Is that the best you've got? Because it's not terribly compelling. I'd be much more tempted to re-examine my 'universal principle' for errors if it forced me to believe something so absurd.\n \n \nNothing can originate, unaided, that which it does not itself possess. No mass of molecules can generate an original adaptive DNA message, all by itself, or unintentionally, by some entropic act of destruction. \"Ex nihilo, ab nihilo, nihil fit.\" Why is something so plain and obvious something you simply cannot accept as fact?!? \n\n \n Because on the one hand I've got you waxing philosophical about volition and teleology, and on the other hand I'm looking at a point mutation indistinguishable from any other that you would be happy to describe as having occurred at random. In fact, you would be happy to describe that very mutation as having happened at random, right up to the point where we find an environment in which it is helpful, whereupon you change your mind and decide it 'must have been' intentional all along.\n \n I just can't see a carcinogen, or quantum uncertainty, or an energetic particle, or whatever else causes random mutation, respecting your philosophical objection to what changes it ought to be able to induce, let alone looking into the future and making sure the change it makes won't ever be helpful.\n \n You go on further, but you still do not explain how random mutation is supposed to avoid inducing mutations that are later exposed as adaptive. After all, RM has nothing to do with vitality, so it must be explicable via the physical forces. So explain to me, in terms of the physical forces, how RM knows to avoid inducing any mutation that might - might, mind you - turn out to be useful. Give me a reason why it can tweak one nucleotide but not another.\n \n Again, I'd ask you not to try and turn this around and ask me to prove that any one mutation was random. You acknowledge that random mutations occur; it is your contention that specifically identified helpful mutations, physically indistinguishable from any other, cannot be among their number. I'm asking you why this is so.\n \n \nWhenever you mean or imply, \"adaptive\", wrt your \"point mutation\", I've been there, done that,already. As you well know, since I did it to the last few would-be examples that you yourself presented. Non-adaptive point mutations can happen as and when they please, since they are irrelevent to any objective, meaningful definition of evolution.\n\n \n But most point mutations are non-adaptive to the environment in which they occur, and only later do some of them coincidentally prove adaptive to a different environment.\n \n And since you've previously admitted that usefulness of a mutation to a later environment can be coincidental, you seem to have no objection to raise.\n \n \nHere's a question for you--since when has science accepted random and non-mechanical explanations of anything, [such as your \"RMNS\" explanation for the origins of adaptive bioform and behavioural change (evolution)], as if such stuff constituted a legitimate 'mechanism' (as that word is defined by science)? \n\n \n Since when has evolution been random and non-mechanical?\n \n \nNot hardly!! In hypermutation, not only is there no 'slightly' about control and correction,\n\n \n My mistake; retracted. \n \n \nas well the actual generation of 'different' material is robust. A perfect example of the heuristic mechanism of 'brain-storming', where new ideas are rapidly and copiously generated, while at the same time criticism and inhibition are drastically reduced. A very intelligent and productive problem-solving system.\n\n \n Which nevertheless is still only not fixing externally induced random mutations.\n \n \nOnly if your definition of 'random' is incapable of making the distinction between accidental/stochastic and intentional/heuristic. All materialist/ mechanist definitions are so handicapped, metaphysically.\n\n \n But the origin of the mutations hasn't changed, WW, only the effectiveness of the mechanism for correcting them. They're as random and subject to elevation by carcinogens as they ever were.\n \n \nI have no idea where you dreampt up this last snide trash, that which you falsely insinuate forms a part of EAM\n\n \n You specifically described bacteria remembering mutations in a form outside of their genome; that was your explanation as to why the first appearance of a mutation in a colony doesn't count as the 'origin' of that mutation. Initially you said these memories were stored in the collective colony, but after I pointed out that they seem to be 'remembered' with equal facility by colonies cloned from a single cell, you changed your tune. If I misunderstood what the new tune was, I apologise and invite you to explain it again.\n \n \nTrue. But your assumption is that there is no control and direction involved applies only to stochastic processes. Where any such control or direction is involved, it is an heuristic process.\n\n \n You're coming at it all backwards. We look at the occurrence of mutations, both within a population and in terms of the changes they involve, and note that it constitues stochastic variation. If we saw a distribution skewed towards success, we could infer control and direction, but we don't. No observation of control or direction = no heuristic.\n \n \nAnd does evolution proceed under those conditions? No. See, coelecanth, etc. etc. etc.\n\n \n Of course it does; it's just that the coelecanth has attained a local fitness maxima and its environment hasn't deviated enough for evolution to take it elsewhere. That doesn't mean evolution has stopped, only that it is fizzing around a static point.\n \n \nBut darwinism says that not only is mutation random and constant and unceasing, it says that evolution is random and constant and unceasing. Except that, darn it, it just isn't. Darwinism denies the fact of biological stasis.\n\n \n No such thing as biological stasis :) No two coelecanth are alike - the environment (in which I include the activities of other organisms) may keep selecting more or less the same phenotype as the best, but variation is continuing to arise regardless.\n \n \nNo, it was not. The same ol' same ol' assumptions were reiterated, is all.\n\n \n Oh, I see. So Mike Majerus was lying when he said he spent the last seven years observing peppered moth predation, noting their resting habitats and correlating the results with the decline in carbonaria?\n \n \nWell, it is funny, [but sad, too], how you guys present and swallow your own tendentious assumptions. Just as if they were empirically established facts.\n\n \n Again, I don't have anything to add; I just like to savour this stuff.",

So which are you wrong about, peeling?\n \n \n\n Quote:\n I do?!? Haw! You are trying to claim that 'stochastic' is an absolute, that is, that it is an 'all or nothing' proposition, that an event is entirely stochastic or it's not at all stochastic. Nothing relative allowed. That's ridiculous. \n \n \n Yes, it is, because that's not what I'm claiming. \n\n \n **\n So you say now, but looking back at what you said, it still looks that way.\n \n \n\n Stochastic refers to the pattern and bias - or rather the lack of them - in a random sequence.\n\n \n **\n Funny, that's not how the word is defined--\n \n \"sto\u00b7chas\u00b7tic (st&#333;-k&#259;s't&#301;k) \n adj.\n Of, relating to, or characterized by conjecture; conjectural.\n Statistics. \n Involving or containing a random variable or variables: stochastic calculus.\n Involving chance or probability: a stochastic stimulation.\" \n \n at answers.com\n \n \n\n Restrictions on the range of numbers in a sequence does not make a pattern of them any more or less stochastic. \n\n \n **\n Restrictions on a range of possibilities always increase probability, and increased probability means 'less stochastic', less a matter of chance, less conjectural.

We are talking 'variables', not 'values' [even in the mathematical sense], at this point. And it does very much depend upon the 'range of variables', just as I said.\n \n \n\n Like I said: brush up on your understanding of the term before making statements about it.\n\n \n **\n HAW!! The irony of it all. Evidently you are the one who should, \"brush up on your understanding of the term before making statements about it. ROTFLMFAO!!\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Except that, being artificial, i.e., wifully and intelligently designed to produce exactly what it does produce, \n \n \n But what the variation 'does produce' is not biased towards success; it is stochastic.\n\n \n **\n The \"variation\" does not \"produce\" anything. First, you and your program produce the \"variation\", then you control, modify and direct that \"variation\" until you get the \"variation\" [effect] that you intended from the jump --a snake's head. How can you go on talking your silly nonsense about how productive, adaptive, useful, complex outcomes can 'just happen, all by themselves'?!?!?! We aren't talking imagined 'weasals in cloud patterns', here.\n Either this snake's head image is a truly adaptive trait, or it's as meaningless as a random cloud, or 'the face of Jesus' in a rind of cheese. Choose one. \n \n \n\n Hence you have no grounds for inferring one goal over any other.\n\n \n **\n That would be true if we were talking clouds that look like weasals, or maybe giraffes, or maybe a fish, or maybe... But if, as you assume, this snake image on the worm is an adaptive trait, then from the adaptive benefit, it's productivity and inherent complexity [see, 'identity' and 'recognition'], then yes, I most certainly can, quite reasonably, infer the 'goal' or 'objective' of 'scaring predators away', as opposed to that of 'attracting a mate closer', or whatever. Just as I can infer that a tool with a sharp edge is used for cutting things. I could be wrong, but it's an hypothesis worth testing. And it is testable, unlike whether or not a cloud looks very much like a weasal.\n \n \n\n Adaptive variants would still thrive and maladaptive ones still wouldn't regardless of the 'goal' or lack of one behind the variation.\n\n \n **\n 'Adaptation' is the point, not 'variation'. Other than that, what's your point? Your observation is simply irrelevent to the discussion. Yes, it's true that a perfect copy of the Mona Lisa could appear, randomly, on a mouldy wall, but it is highly unlikely to do so. Yes, a snake's head image could randomly show up on a worm's rump, too, and be much less unlikely, especially if it only 'suggests' a snake, and predators are quite unimpressed by it. But if it really does serve an adaptive function, then assuming that it must truly be accidental just because it might possibly be accidental, and that the image only coincidentally resembles the worm's predators' predator, thus driving them away and increasing the worm's longevity, is a dubious conclusion based more on metaphysics than empirical science.\n \n As for the assumption that the image was formed by 'natural selection', which somehow 'caused' a difference in predation before there was a complete image that could 'cause' that difference, you are once more giving an effect credit for being its own cause. A common failing among darwinists. Either that or you give the imaginations of predatory birds far, far, too much credit.\n \n \n\n If you can demonstrate that such would not be the case, I invite you to do so.\n\n \n **\n Done and done.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Either the above is true, as per EAM, or darwinism's assertion that particles of acid banged around in a genome produced stochastically distributed colour spots on a worms' tails that, for some strange reason, proved less appealing to predators in one configuration than in another, despite not resembling anything at all, so that, by some magic, the stochastically distributed spots stopped being generated stochastically, or at least, less stochastically, \n \n \n I'm just going to have to stop you there. The variation doesn't become any less stochastic.\n\n \n **\n Maybe not to statistician, but it sure does get a hell of a lot less 'stochastic' [uncertain, speculative, 'chancy']] where worms and predatory birds are concerned.\n \n \n \n\n However, what it is now varying around are the most successful phenotypes from the previous generation. And the next generation will vary around the most successful again, and so forth.\n\n \n **\n You are 'begging the question' by assuming that, to begin with, before a clear and recognisable image is already fully-formed, that there is any 'success' at all. \n \n \n\n You seem to have it in your head that 'stochastic variation' of camouflage must be something akin to static on a de-tuned TV: endless and unrestricted variation which must somehow 'magically' turn up something like a snake head, which then 'magically' stops varying quite so much.\n\n \n **\n No, that is the very opposite of what I have in my head. It is, however, exactly what you have in your head that you are trying to stuff in my head--and jim's, and the heads of any gullible lurkers out there.\n \n \n \n\n I can understand how that would sound ridiculous, because it is - and it is not representative of evolutionary theory.\n\n \n **\n It's the spitting image, [excuse the joke], of your darwinist notion of how mimicry and camouflage arise in evolution.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n This RMNS stuff is just so silly.\n \n \n \n The version you have in mind is, absolutely \n\n \n **\n You and your friends wrote that version, and this snake thingy is just one more 'variation on a theme'.\n \n Break time.",

Selection will constrain the directional characteristics.\n \n More at : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk\n \n \n \n \n \nA random walk, sometimes called a \"drunkard's walk,\" is a formalization in mathematics, computer science, and physics of the intuitive idea of taking successive steps, each in a random direction. For example, the path traced by a molecule as it travels in a liquid or a gas is a random walk.\n Contents\n [show]\n \n * 1 Definition\n * 2 One-dimensional random walk\n * 3 Higher dimensions\n * 4 Random walk on graphs\n * 5 Relation to Brownian motion\n * 6 Self-interacting random walks\n * 7 Applications\n * 8 Probabilistic interpretation\n * 9 See also\n * 10 References\n o 10.1 Bibliography\n * 11 External links\n \n [edit] Definition\n \n The simplest random walk is a path constructed according to the following rules:\n \n * There is a starting point.\n * The distance from one point in the path to the next is a constant.\n * The direction from one point in the path to the next is chosen at random, and no direction is more probable than another.\n \n [edit] One-dimensional random walk\n \n One-dimensional random walk takes place on a line. So, one starts at zero, and at each step one moves by a fixed amount along one of the two directions from the current point, with the direction being chosen randomly.\n \n The average straight-line distance between start and finish points of a one-dimensional random walk of n steps is on the order of \\sqrt{n}, or more precisely, its asymptote converges to \\sqrt{2 n \\over \\pi} \\approx 0.8 \\sqrt{n}. If \"average\" is understood in the sense of root-mean-square, then the average distance after n steps is \\sqrt{n} times the step length exactly.\n \n Suppose we draw a line some distance from the origin of the walk. How many times will the random walk cross the line? The following, perhaps surprising, theorem is the answer: for any random walk in one dimension, every point in the domain will almost surely be crossed an infinite number of times. [In two (or perhaps three) dimensions, this is equivalent to the statement that any line (or plane) will be crossed an infinite number of times.] This problem has many names: the level-crossing problem, the recurrence problem or the gambler's ruin problem. The source of the last name is as follows: if you are a gambler with a finite amount of money playing a fair game against a bank with an infinite amount of money, you will surely lose. The amount of money you have will perform a random walk, and it will almost surely, at some time, reach 0-and the game will be over.\n \n The expected number of steps until a one dimensional random walk goes up to b or down to -a is ab. The probability that the random walk will go up to b steps before going down a steps is a \\over a+b\n",

   "\n Quote:\n Simply by being themselves. As I've told you at least 100 times, random mutations are inherently and intrinsically lacking in those properties which generate adaptation and organismic productivity--i.e., intelligence and volition. Without these qualities in control, every mutation is merely entropic. \n \n \n Ah, the famous 'universal principle'. So that's your explanation for why this nucleotide is susceptible to random mutation, and this one and this one, but not that one in the middle? That RM wouldn't 'dare' change that nucleotide because it would be adaptive?\n\n \n **\n So now you are anthropomorphizing 'random mutation'?! That figures, since that is what you did with \"natural selection\". But despite the colourful imagery, you still have a problem. You have no example empirically observed examples wherebye a random [not responsive to proximate organismic, systematic stimulus] genetic mutation fulfilled the claim upon which all of fisherism, aka latter-day darwinism, depends utterly--that such a stochastic, random system failure in a complex, productive, coded information communication system breakdown can, and repeatedly does, produce an adaptive, productive, organismic trait mutation in the mutant organism.\n \n Now, one would expect that since this is the theoretic lynchpin supporting everything darwinian, you fellas would have, say, 300 million clear examples of it from indisputable observed instances in nature across the board, bacteria to bobolinks. NOT!! You've had to search every nook and cranny, use distorted language and worse logic, just to produce a half dozen instances that 'might' back you up, provided you squint when you look at them!! This ain't science--it's legerdemain.\n \n Golly, this \"famous universal principle\" of darwinism just hasn't been up to snuff, has it? Not empirically. Not scientifically. And it fails just as badly as a metaphysical postulate, which is all it ever was or ever could be.\n \n \n\n Is that the best you've got? \n\n \n **\n It, plus all the negative evidence supporting it--i.e., that you've got nothing to back up your claim and negate my claim--that is, nothing empirical to negate my rational postulate-- means that I've got way more and better stuff than you have. Because what I've got is real, both logically and empirically, whereas what you've got is smoke and mirrors.\n \n \n\n Because it's not terribly compelling. \n\n \n **\n Logic and fact are never \"compelling\" to the 'true believer'. That's what makes darwinists and creationists the two sides of the exact same coin.\n \n \n\n I'd be much more tempted to re-examine my 'universal principle' for errors if it forced me to believe something so absurd.\n\n \n **\n What's absurd is that after a half-century of rock solid evidence to the contrary, particularly since the advent of systems biology, genomics, and on and on, you believe, as if it were still 1952, that evolving a bit of novel, original, adaptive genomic information in a complex biosystem, an organism, is just a straightforward, linear, chemico-mechanical matter of changing a nucleotide by accident. Absurd is hardly a strong enough word such stubborn credulousness. \n \n \n\n Because on the one hand I've got you waxing philosophical\n\n \n **\n Thinking rationally and logically is anything but \"waxing philosophical\". I guess you didn't know that.\n \n \n\n about volition and teleology, and on the other hand I'm looking at a point mutation indistinguishable from any other that you would be happy to describe as having occurred at random.\n\n \n **\n Not true. We've been over this, you've been shown your error, but still you insist on repeating what has been proven to be nothing but a self-serving distortion of a systematic cellular process by arbitrarily labelling it 'random'.\n Your example failed--get over it and move on!\n \n \n\n In fact, you would be happy to describe that very mutation as having happened at random, right up to the point where we find an environment in which it is helpful, whereupon you change your mind and decide it 'must have been' intentional all along.\n\n \n **\n What mutation are you talking about. The one you said was the product of 'random causation', but wasn't?\n \n \n\n I just can't see a carcinogen, or quantum uncertainty, or an energetic particle, or whatever else causes random mutation, respecting your philosophical objection to what changes it ought to be able to induce, let alone looking into the future and making sure the change it makes won't ever be helpful.\n\n \n \n **\n That's the fallacy of personal incredulity. If you understood complex systems, productivity, and information, you might begin to see why your metaphysical assumption just isn't supported by empirical observation.\n \n \n\n You go on further, but you still do not explain how random mutation is supposed to avoid inducing mutations that are later exposed as adaptive.\n\n \n **\n You just keep beating the same dead horse. I do not haveto \"prove a negative\". I only have to show why the positive assertion, [yours], is dubious and questionable. The onus is 100% on your back to provide empirical evidence supporting your positive assertion that random accidents, entropy, can not only destroy or reduce the productivity of a complex system, but can also generate new, increased, systemic productivity. Surely, since this is the cornerstone of your entire darwinist belief system, you must have millions of indisputable empirically observed instance to get you over the logical absurdity and irrationality of it all, don't you?

   "Darwinists say certain things peculiar to darwinism and its materialist/'mechanist/positivist metaphysical underpinnings. You say those same things. That makes you a darwinist. But you say that you are not a darwinist, because you also say things that contradict darwinism's metaphysic. So which are you wrong about, peeling?\n\n \n Is it the square peg's fault it won't go through the round hole?\n \n \nYou admit that I'm right and you're wrong, and then try to cover that up with some gobbledygook.\n\n \n No, WW, I told you that you were wrong, because you are. You started out wrong, you're wrong now, and the longer you keep rolling on the floor laughing at your own jokes and dismissing explanations you don't like as gobbledygook the longer you're going to remain wrong.\n \n You can have a perfectly stochastic binary sequence. You can also have a perfectly stochastic base-4 sequence, which in binary notation is equivalent to two parallel stochastic binary sequences (two 'variables'). That is also equivalent to a single stochastic binary sequence with alternate values representing the two variables. By induction one can represent a stochastic sequence of any number and any scope of variables with a single stochastic binary sequence.\n \n Stochastic refers to pattern and bias, not range and number of variables. As chemist says, the drunkard's walk (limited random variation around a previously reached location) is perfectly accurately described as 'stochastic', regardless of how many degrees of freedom the drunkard has to pursue.\n \n Perhaps I'm not explaining things clearly enough, I don't know. If that's the case, I'm sorry.\n \n \nThe \"variation\" does not \"produce\" anything. First, you and your program produce the \"variation\", then you control, modify and direct that \"variation\" until you get the \"variation\" [effect] that you intended from the jump --a snake's head.\n\n \n No, I don't direct the variation. I direct the selection of which variations make it through to the next round of breeding. That is an important distinction when talking about adaptation being endogenous.\n \n \nEither this snake's head image is a truly adaptive trait, or it's as meaningless as a random cloud, or 'the face of Jesus' in a rind of cheese. Choose one.\n\n \n Or, it's the accumulated effects of variations that were externally tested and found to be 'best', just like the caterpillar. The picture isn't trying to be anything, and the program that generates it is only deterministically inducing random change. I, as the predator, am indirectly 'choosing' the best camouflage by eating the worst camouflaged prey.\n \n \nBut if it really does serve an adaptive function, then assuming that it must truly be accidental just because it might possibly be accidental, and that the image only coincidentally resembles the worm's predators' predator, thus driving them away and increasing the worm's longevity, is a dubious conclusion based more on metaphysics than empirical science.\n\n \n Consider the question I asked Jim, WW: does it really make sense to believe a caterpillar can understand the bird/snake dynamic? The only actor in that scenario who we are pretty sure knows a snake is something to avoid is the bird, so it makes sense that it's the bird's actions that are filtering variation exhibited by the caterpillar.\n \n \nYou are 'begging the question' by assuming that, to begin with, before a clear and recognisable image is already fully-formed, that there is any 'success' at all.\n\n \n If that were not true, EAM could not have produced the end result either, since there would be no positive feedback for it to act upon. Unless you're saying it happened in one generation. In which case, why don't we see caterpillars turning up looking like pencils, or beetles like beer-bottle caps? \n \n As I pointed out to Jim, it's a mistake to assume that selective predation had to be responsible for turning a caterpillar that looked nothing at all like a snake into one that looks a lot like one. There are squillions of caterpillar species; the chances of just one looking a little bit like its predator's predator, especially when that creature is also basically a sausage, aren't beyond the realm of possibility.\n \n \nNo, that is the very opposite of what I have in my head. It is, however, exactly what you have in your head that you are trying to stuff in my head--and jim's, and the heads of any gullible lurkers out there.\n\n \n Here we go again: you describe a nonsensical parody of descent-with-modification and say it's what I believe in, and then you call me a liar when I dispute it. \n \n \nSo now you are anthropomorphizing 'random mutation'?!\n\n \n No, WW, clearly not, and again you're embarking on a tirade to confuse the issue and dodge the question.\n \n Here's the question again: \"How are random mutations supposed to avoid being adaptive to the present or some future environment?\"\n \n Since RM is nothing to do with vitality, any restrictions placed upon which point mutations can occur at random must be in terms of the physical forces alone. Let's see if you make any headway towards giving me an answer.\n \n \nYou have no example empirically observed examples wherebye a random [not responsive to proximate organismic, systematic stimulus] genetic mutation fulfilled the claim upon which all of fisherism, aka latter-day darwinism, depends utterly--that such a stochastic, random system failure in a complex, productive, coded information communication system breakdown can, and repeatedly does, produce an adaptive, productive, organismic trait mutation in the mutant organism.\n\n \n Nope, no answer here. \n \n Instead you make a false claim, ignoring all the scientific tests which establish that mutations occur prior to a selective environment being imposed. I've detailed just such an experiment here, where a colony of resistant bacteria can be cultivated without ever exposing any of the members of that culture to the antibiotic. Even if it does happen, an 'organismic response to a proximate stimulus' clearly isn't a requirement.\n \n \nNow, one would expect that since this is the theoretic lynchpin supporting everything darwinian, you fellas would have, say, 300 million clear examples of it from indisputable observed instances in nature across the board, bacteria to bobolinks. NOT!! You've had to search every nook and cranny, use distorted language and worse logic, just to produce a half dozen instances that 'might' back you up, provided you squint when you look at them!! This ain't science--it's legerdemain.\n\n \n Still no answer.\n \n \nGolly, this \"famous universal principle\" of darwinism just hasn't been up to snuff, has it? Not empirically. Not scientifically. And it fails just as badly as a metaphysical postulate, which is all it ever was or ever could be.\n\n \n None there either.\n \n \nIt, plus all the negative evidence supporting it--i.e., that you've got nothing to back up your claim and negate my claim--that is, nothing empirical to negate my rational postulate-- means that I've got way more and better stuff than you have.

Absurd is hardly a strong enough word such stubborn credulousness. \n\n \n And still no answer, just a bunch of insults.\n \n \nThinking rationally and logically is anything but \"waxing philosophical\". I guess you didn't know that.\n\n \n And on...\n \n \nNot true. We've been over this, you've been shown your error, but still you insist on repeating what has been proven to be nothing but a self-serving distortion of a systematic cellular process by arbitrarily labelling it 'random'.\n Your example failed--get over it and move on!\n\n \n And on...\n \n \nWhat mutation are you talking about.

The onus is 100% on your back to provide empirical evidence supporting your positive assertion that random accidents, entropy, can not only destroy or reduce the productivity of a complex system, but can also generate new, increased, systemic productivity.\n\n \n High-level talk about information, entropy, and systemic productivity still fails to speak to the actual event I'm claiming can happen at random: a point mutation. You even agree they can happen at random. We empirically observe that the source of some adaptive traits are point mutations, and can readily verify this by gene splicing.\n \n The reality of our debate is this: you are using philosophy to fence off a vague, unspecified, and at-all-times-subject-to-revision subset of an organism's genome and saying 'Random mutation cannot occur to those nucleotides, because if it did a trait would arise that is adaptive to this, or some possible future environment, and that can only - not does only, but can only - happen intentionally'.\n \n All I'm doing, by saying random mutation can be responsible for those altered nucleotides, is not fencing any part of the genome off. I'm not making any extraordinary claim at all; we both agree that random mutations happen. You're the one adding the caveat '...but not to these nucleotides'. Why should the onus be on me to prove you wrong?\n \n Gentle teasing aside, I'm sorry for not responding in more detail to the points you made above, but to do so would be to risk sending the whole debate off the rails since none of it constitues an answer to the question I posed. All I'm asking from you is an explanation of how the external causes of RM manage to avoid the nucleotides you say cannot be accidentally changed. That's reasonable enough, isn't it? If it's true that a particular adaptive point mutation could not have been accidental, then logically random mutations of that locus must be impossible. So what makes that the case?\n \n If, on the other hand, you prefer to retract your claim that they could not have been accidental, and replace it with the claim that they were not, then we can by all means continue the discussion on that basis, and talk about evidence etc.",

Apparently you've completely forgotten the point. Or you are desperately blowing verbal smoke in the hope that you can escape in the confusion. We were not discussing abstractions. First we were discussing genes/adaptive mutations/evolution, and then peripherally, your computer 'simulation', which you claimed was 'stochastic' [undirected and non-directional, ateleological and unsystematic] but which was and is undeniably heuristic [diected, directional, teleological and systematic]. All this smoke and mirrors from statistical math is utterly 'non sequitur' to the point. Chemist has schooled you well in the art of impertinent red herrings posing as learned pronouncements.\n \n \n\n Stochastic refers to pattern and bias, not range and number of variables.\n\n \n **\n Stochastic refers to what the definition I cited says it refers to, not what you want it to refer to. You've already admitted that 'stochastic' is dependent upon 'uncertainty', which depends upon 'unknowns', as 'possibilites', and that as these 'variables' are reduced or increased in number and range, so is the stochasticity involved in the matter is reduced or expanded. So why are you still posturing?\n \n \n\n As chemist says, the drunkard's walk (limited random variation around a previously reached location) is perfectly accurately described as 'stochastic', regardless of how many degrees of freedom the drunkard has to pursue.\n\n \n **\n Another non sequitur, based upon a misdirection. I never said that limiting stochasticity rendered the stochastic non-stochastic, except when the variables have been limited to a single possibility. I quite clearly asserted nothing more than that stochasticity, the degree of stochastic uncertainty involved, can be greater or lesser, a fact you've already conceded. I saiod this to show that an heuristic process of limiting or eliminating possibilities according to some criterion of judgement, including a 'best available solution or choice' as defined by a given problem or issue] is very different from a process [call it chance-based, random, stochastic, indiscriminate, ateleological, spontaneous, or what you will] in which 'variables', 'unknowns', 'possibilities', 'uncertainties' are never eliminated or constrained, but simply generated or constant. So why this attempt to make it look like I said anything else?\n \n To take the drunkard example. He/she attempts to leave a barroom. The room has three doors. One to a storeroom, one to an office, and one amn exit to the street. If the drunk merely wishes to open a door, that is a stochastic, ateleological process, and any door will serve his purposes. But if he wishes to leave the room and go home, only one door will do. Since he has no recollection of what door he entered through, and his faculties are very much diminished, all three doors stochastically equal, until he starts reducing their 'range and number' by an empirical process of elimination. That is, an heuristic, teleological process directed and determined by a sought-for outcome as a criterion of judgement--a door that gives access to the street.\n \n Heuristically, if the drunk tries the door to the office once, he won't try it twice. Stochastically, if the drunk tries the door to the office once, he/she may try it again a dozen times. Or keep walking back and forth between the office door and the storeroom door, again and again, until he/she passes oput or is thrown out the proper door by the barman. That's the difference between mindless, accidental, random, stochastic 'mutations', and heuristic systematic, goal-directed 'mutations'. Of which your self-styled \"stochastic\"\n computer simulation is a perfect example.\n \n WRT RMNS, this is a stochastic process so long as no outcome is preferred, i.e., any door will do, since 'open a door' is the only rule of random mutation.\n Saying that, by coincidence, the 'door to the street' 'just happens', 'coincidentally', to eventually get opened [adapted] by a 'blind drunk' who can't even remember why he/she feels compelled to stumble about, opening doors, does not make the search activity any less stochastic,-- just luckier, this time. And there is no science in that. \n \n \n\n Quote:\n The \"variation\" does not \"produce\" anything. First, you and your program produce the \"variation\", then you control, modify and direct that \"variation\" until you get the \"variation\" [effect] that you intended from the jump --a snake's head. \n \n \n No, I don't direct the variation. I direct the selection of which variations make it through to the next round of breeding. That is an important distinction when talking about adaptation being endogenous.\n\n \n **\n Directing the variation by directing the selection is still directing the variation, and there is no \"distinction\" except a forced semantic quibble. That you controlled the 'adaptation' by controlling the 'selection of the variation' simply makes the process involved in your simulation 'exogenous' instead of 'endogenous', as performed by real organisms in the natural world.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Either this snake's head image is a truly adaptive trait, or it's as meaningless as a random cloud, or 'the face of Jesus' in a rind of cheese. Choose one. \n \n \n Or, it's the accumulated effects of variations that were externally tested and found to be 'best', just like the caterpillar. The picture isn't trying to be anything, and the program that generates it is only deterministically inducing random change. I, as the predator, am indirectly 'choosing' the best camouflage by eating the worst camouflaged prey.\n\n \n **\n Sounds credible, but you still cannot o'erleap the objection that until the 'image' is effective, it is ineffective, and it isn't effective unless and until it convinces a bird that it's looking at a dangerous snake, and not a tasty worm. But once that is the fact of the matter, then the job is done, and there need be no further 'selection' involved. And until that effect is accomplished, there is nothing to 'select' for, so no 'selection' can occur.\n \n Unless you think that birds look at worms and think, \"Those spots on this delicious, nuticious worm kinda remind me of something; I can't think what, but nevertheless, as hungry as I and/or my chicks may be, I'm going to pass on this one\". \n \n Break time.",

   "\n Quote:\n But if it really does serve an adaptive function, then assuming that it must truly be accidental just because it might possibly be accidental, and that the image only coincidentally resembles the worm's predators' predator, thus driving them away and increasing the worm's longevity, is a dubious conclusion based more on metaphysics than empirical science. \n \n \n Consider the question I asked Jim, WW: does it really make sense to believe a caterpillar can understand the bird/snake dynamic?\n\n \n **\n Look back at what you've quoted. Do you you see the \"if\" that makes up the second word in my assertion? What I am saying is that there are two ways to look at the phenomenon. The first, \"A\", depends upon the presumption that the 'image' serves an adaptive purpose that benefits the worm. AFAIK, there is no science backing up this assumption. Could be that birds are unaffected, and eat as many of these worms as they do of any other. They may even see it as a tasty little lizard, if their minds are as imaginative as our own. Which I seriously doubt.\n \n The second assumption, \"B\", is that the arrangement of pigment is completely accidental, does not suggest a snake or anything else to a non-human, including predatory birds, and has no adaptive effect.\n \n You have to pick one or the other. If you make the assumption, \"A\", that the image is an adaptive trait, then, as I pointed out, you have to determine at what point it is adaptive/effective--and before that point there can be no 'selection', and after that point no further 'enhancement by selection'' is required. \n \n So wrt your point, no, it 'makes no sense' \"to believe a caterpillar can understand the bird/snake dynamic\". It also makes no sense to believe that a caterpillar has an aerial view of its own hind end. But that is not the issue, since I, [and I believe everybody else], am not insisting that in caterpillars, worms, lizards, fish, butterflies, moths, and other instances, camouflage and mimicry arise by deliberate, analytical, conscious effort on the part of the organisms who have that camouflage/mimicry ability. That's just the darwinist straw-man caricature of the EAM mechanism. I am simply questioning the darwinian assumption that such complex abilities, if meaningfully adaptive, arise by genetic accidents coincidentally conforming to relative environmental circumstance.\n \n \n\n The only actor in that scenario who we are pretty sure knows a snake is something to avoid is the bird, so it makes sense that it's the bird's actions that are filtering variation exhibited by the caterpillar.\n\n \n **\n Again, that is purely presumptive, and would mean nothing unless and until the image affected predation, (that is, as in Bateson's epigram, became 'a difference that made a difference'), after which it would be a waste of energy to 'improve', and would be completely counterproductive if it continued to change randomly, in the 'spontaneous', aka, accidental, stochastic, unintentional, spontaneous, fashion by which it is assumed, by darwinists, to have arisen in the first place.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n You are 'begging the question' by assuming that, to begin with, before a clear and recognisable image is already fully-formed, that there is any 'success' at all. \n \n \n If that were not true, EAM could not have produced the end result either, since there would be no positive feedback for it to act upon. Unless you're saying it happened in one generation. In which case, why don't we see caterpillars turning up looking like pencils, or beetles like beer-bottle caps? \n\n \n \n **\n But I have not claimed that this paricular case is in fact adaptive--to me that is still an undecided issue. However, the issue of camouflage/mimicry in general is very much an adaptive trait/ability/property. Just how and through what channels 'feed-back' reaches and effects the organism's ability to control, teleologically, systematically, heuristically, its own 'appearance'/'identity' in the eyes of other organisms is not at all obvious, but that does nothing to support a \"chance of the gaps\" argument from ignorance.\n \n \n\n As I pointed out to Jim, it's a mistake to assume that selective predation had to be responsible for turning a caterpillar that looked nothing at all like a snake into one that looks a lot like one. There are squillions of caterpillar species; the chances of just one looking a little bit like its predator's predator, especially when that creature is also basically a sausage, aren't beyond the realm of possibility.\n\n \n **\n Another appeal to \"The Magick of Great Big Numbers\".\n \n \n\n Quote:\n No, that is the very opposite of what I have in my head. It is, however, exactly what you have in your head that you are trying to stuff in my head--and jim's, and the heads of any gullible lurkers out there. \n \n \n Here we go again: you describe a nonsensical parody of descent-with-modification and say it's what I believe in, and then you call me a liar when I dispute it. \n\n \n **\n Simply untrue.\n \n \n\n Here's the question again: \"How are random mutations supposed to avoid being adaptive to the present or some future environment?\"\n\n \n **\n Asked and answered.\n \n \n\n Since RM is nothing to do with vitality, any restrictions placed upon which point mutations can occur at random must be in terms of the physical forces alone. Let's see if you make any headway towards giving me an answer.\n\n \n **\n I've already told you that I am not about to be forced into the position of trying to 'prove a negative proposition', which is impossible. The real issue here is your positive assertion that random molecular changes in genomic coding [mutations] mechanically, in a chemically determined set of linear reactions, result, without any applied discrimination or control, in a positive, productive, coincidentally adaptive change in an organism, immediately or at at any future date. That is your metaphysical assumption, and as yet you have failed the burden of scientific proof that lies upon you, i.e., to find empirical facts that back it up in any testable fashion.\n \n [quote]\n Quote:\n You have no example empirically observed examples wherebye a random [not responsive to proximate organismic, systematic stimulus] genetic mutation fulfilled the claim upon which all of fisherism, aka latter-day darwinism, depends utterly--that such a stochastic, random system failure in a complex, productive, coded information communication system breakdown can, and repeatedly does, produce an adaptive, productive, organismic trait mutation in the mutant organism. \n \n \n Nope, no answer here. \n \n Instead you make a false claim, ignoring all the scientific tests which establish that mutations occur prior to a selective environment being imposed. I've detailed just such an experiment here, where a colony of resistant bacteria can be cultivated without ever exposing any of the members of that culture to the antibiotic. Even if it does happen, an 'organismic response to a proximate stimulus' clearly isn't a requirement.[quote]\n \n **\n At risk of repeating myself ad nauseum, what you actually showed was nothing more than that a stimulated response systematically, heuristically arrived at by living cells in a collective, eusocial organism, a bacterial colony, can have advantages, adaptively, that apply to more than just the original teleological stimulus. That simply does not satisfy the stated condition that a purely random, accidental mutation spontaneously arising confer an adaptive benefit to an organism or its descendents, in some other context at some later date. And you blustering on and on that, 'it does so', just won't make it true.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Now, one would expect that since this is the theoretic lynchpin supporting everything darwinian, you fellas would have, say, 300 million clear examples of it from indisputable observed instances in nature across the board, bacteria to bobolinks. NOT!! You've had to search every nook and cranny, use distorted language and worse logic, just to produce a half dozen instances that 'might' back you up, provided you squint when you look at them!! This ain't science--it's legerdemain. \n \n \n Still no answer.\n \n \n Quote:\n Golly, this \"famous universal principle\" of darwinism just hasn't been up to snuff, has it? Not empirically. Not scientifically. And it fails just as badly as a metaphysical postulate, which is all it ever was or ever could be. \n \n \n None there either.\n \n \n Quote:\n It, plus all the negative evidence supporting it--i.e., that you've got nothing to back up your claim and negate my claim--that is, nothing empirical to negate my rational postulate-- means that I've got way more and better stuff than you have. Because what I've got is real, both logically and empirically, whereas what you've got is smoke and mirrors. \n \n \n And still no answer is forthcoming.\n \n \n Quote:\n Logic and fact are never \"compelling\" to the 'true believer'. That's what makes darwinists and creationists the two sides of the exact same coin. \n \n \n No answer again...\n \n \n Quote:\n What's absurd is that after a half-century of rock solid evidence to the contrary, particularly since the advent of systems biology, genomics, and on and on, you believe, as if it were still 1952, that evolving a bit of novel, original, adaptive genomic information in a complex biosystem, an organism, is just a straightforward, linear, chemico-mechanical matter of changing a nucleotide by accident. Absurd is hardly a strong enough word such stubborn credulousness. \n \n \n And still no answer, just a bunch of insults.\n \n \n Quote:\n Thinking rationally and logically is anything but \"waxing philosophical\". I guess you didn't know that. \n \n \n And on...\n \n \n Quote:\n Not true. We've been over this, you've been shown your error, but still you insist on repeating what has been proven to be nothing but a self-serving distortion of a systematic cellular process by arbitrarily labelling it 'random'.\n Your example failed--get over it and move on! \n \n \n And on...\n \n \n Quote:\n What mutation are you talking about. The one you said was the product of 'random causation', but wasn't? \n \n \n And on...\n \n \n Quote:\n That's the fallacy of personal incredulity. If you understood complex systems, productivity, and information, you might begin to see why your metaphysical assumption just isn't supported by empirical observation. \n \n \n And on...\n\n \n \n **\n Yadayadayada, and blah-blah, woof-woof.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n You just keep beating the same dead horse. I do not haveto \"prove a negative\". I only have to show why the positive assertion, [yours], is dubious and questionable. The onus is 100% on your back to provide empirical evidence supporting your positive assertion that random accidents, entropy, can not only destroy or reduce the productivity of a complex system, but can also generate new, increased, systemic productivity. \n \n \n High-level talk about information, entropy, and systemic productivity still fails to speak to the actual event I'm claiming can happen at random: a point mutation. You even agree they can happen at random. We empirically observe that the source of some adaptive traits are point mutations, and can readily verify this by gene splicing.\n\n \n **\n I have never denied that accidental, entopic, maladaptive or ineffectual point mutations happen. That amount to denying the presence of entropy in the organismic system and its genomic subsystem, and that would be irrational and insupportable. However, acceting the reality of entropy, and then conferring upon entropy the power to generate productive, anti-entropic, adaptive, novel, additional genomic complexity and organismic adatedness, is a metaphysical leap that I, unlike yourself, am unwilling to make. It is not enough to merely assert, over and over and over again, as you constantly do, that, because some point mutations occurring in the bottom end of genomic complexity [bacteria, yeasts, protists, whatever] are directly adaptive, that therefore these adaptive mutations arose by spontaneous generation, entropy, accident, whatever, instead of systematically and teleologically.\n \n \n\n The reality of our debate is this: you are using philosophy to fence off a vague, unspecified, and at-all-times-subject-to-revision subset of an organism's genome and saying 'Random mutation cannot occur to those nucleotides, because if it did a trait would arise that is adaptive to this, or some possible future environment, and that can only - not does only, but can only - happen intentionally'.\n\n \n \n **\n Not. The reality of our debate is this-- I am using logic to question your metaphysical assertion that by accidentally losing information [random genetic mutation], new and productive information can be, and constantly is, mechanically/chemically/passively and coincidentally, generated, ab nihilo, ex nihilo.\n \n \n\n All I'm doing, by saying random mutation can be responsible for those altered nucleotides, is not fencing any part of the genome off. I'm not making any extraordinary claim at all; we both agree that random mutations happen. You're the one adding the caveat '...but not to these nucleotides'. Why should the onus be on me to prove you wrong?\n\n \n **\n The onus is not on you to prove me wrong. Neither is the onus on me to prove you wrong. The onus is on you to prove you right. \n \n \n\n Gentle teasing aside, I'm sorry for not responding in more detail to the points you made above, but to do so would be to risk sending the whole debate off the rails since none of it constitues an answer to the question I posed. All I'm asking from you is an explanation of how the external causes of RM manage to avoid the nucleotides you say cannot be accidentally changed. That's reasonable enough, isn't it? \n\n \n **\n No. It is not reasonable, because the issue is not whether or not this nucleotide is subject to entropy or not, but rather, whether entropic nucleotide mutation, and the accidental loss of its current information, can and does write new and adapive information by blind, unintentional, accident, coincidentally and fortuitously productive at some later date. Your argument never gets beyond the metaphysical, \"I can't see why it couldn't.\", whereas mine shows you rationally just why it couldn't. In a clash of metaphysical argumentation, I'm still a heck of a big jump ahead of you.\n \n \n \n\n If it's true that a particular adaptive point mutation could not have been accidental, then logically random mutations of that locus must be impossible. So what makes that the case?\n\n \n **\n I fail to see the logic in this statement. You are essentially claiming that anything that can be done on purpose, or systematically, can arise accidentally. That makes no sense.\n \n [quote]\n If, on the other hand, you prefer to retract your claim that they could not have been accidental, and replace it with the claim that they were not, then we can by all means continue the discussion on that basis, and talk about evidence.\n \n **\n Why should I retract my metaphysical position, when it's kicking your metaphysical position all over the parking lot?!?",

(Why he chose to help that particular group of caterpillars and not the others, who knows.) 2) ID, Ditto, but for \"God\" substitute \"Unknown Intelligent Entity, possibly a Space Alien.\" (Try not to giggle, and don't ask where either the space alien or God came from.) 3) Theistic evolutionist: God helped the processes of evoution produce the snake-head effect. (Heaven knows how he did it, but His tweaking probably happened earlier rather than later.)]\n \n You are once again misrepresenting the standard evolutionary position. I'm also not aware of any field or lab studies and hard conclusions regarding this particular creature, but a standard sort of hypothesis might postulate that color patterns that probably served some other purpose (possibly looking a bit like dappled light and shadow, possibly patterning used for species recognition during courtship) happened to look a very little bit like a snake head. Not enough to fool anyone 99% of the time, but once in a while, during rainstorms or during lightning, in predawn or late-dusk, in deep shade, or when the predator is fatigued or ill. In a large and variable population, such a very slight edge can be sufficient to start selection toward a much improved mimicry. \n \n Thus, more significantly, one does not have to pick \"one or the other\" of your two options. Moreover, we do not have to determine a point at which the mimicry is adaptive/effective, before which there can be no selection, and after which no further enhancement by selection is needed. Instead, the selection that resulted in the snake-head outcome could have got under way tentatively, slowly, and episodically. Moreover, there is nearly always room for further enhancement. (Does the mimic caterpillar sound like a snake, move like a snake, and/or smell like a snake, for example?) \n \n WW, you have accepted that this mimicry is not under rational control by the caterpillar, in the sense of \"It would be good if I could look like a snake, perhaps if I change A to T in position X of the ABC gene\", and you also reject the god/alien explanation. However, this leaves you with essentially nothing else. \n \n I'd go on, but we've said all the rest before.",

See synonyms at method.\n The prevailing social order; the establishment. Used with the: You can't beat the system.\"\n \n Nucleotide \n Nucleotides are the building blocks of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). Individual nucleotide monomers (single units) are linked together to form polymers, or long chains. DNA chains store genetic information, while RNA chains perform a variety of roles integral to protein synthesis. Individual nucleotides also play important roles in cell metabolism.\n \n Structure\n \n The nucleotide molecule contains three functional groups: a base, a sugar, and a phosphate (see diagram). It may seem puzzling that a nucleic acid should contain a base. While the base portion does have weakly basic properties, the nucleotide as a whole acts as an acid, due to the phosphate group.\n \n The names DNA and RNA are generated from the deoxyribose and ribose sugars found in these two polymers. Both are five-carbon sugars, whose carbons are numbered around the ring from 1&#8242; to 5&#8242; (\"one prime\" to \"five prime\"). The prime distinguishes the carbons on the sugar from the carbons on the base. The sugar in RNA nucleotides is ribose. The sugar in DNA is 2&#8242;-deoxyribose, which lacks an-OH group at the 2&#8242; position. This small difference has some important consequences: The extra oxygen in RNA interferes with double helix formation between RNA chains (though it does not completely prevent it), and makes RNA more susceptible than DNA to base-catalyzed cleavage (breakdown into individual monomers).\n \n A base attaches to the sugar at the sugar's 1&#8242; position. Because of their nitrogen content, the bases are called nitrogenous bases, and are further classified as either purines or pyrimidines. Purine structures have two rings, while pyrimidines have one. The two purine bases found in both DNA and in RNA are guanine (G) and adenine (A). The two pyrimidine bases found in DNA are cytosine (C) and thymine (T), and the two pyrimidine bases found in RNA are cytosine and uracil (U). The only difference between thymine and uracil is the presence of a methyl group in thymine that is lacking in uracil. A base plus a sugar is called a nucleoside.\n \n The phosphate groups are linked to the sugars at the 5&#8242; position. The addition of one to three phosphate groups generates a nucleotide, also known as a nucleoside monophosphate, nucleoside diphosphate, or nucleoside triphosphate. For instance, guanosine triphosphate (GTP) is an RNA nucleotide with three phosphates attached. Deoxycytosine monophosphate (dCMP) is a DNA nucleotide with one phosphate attached.\n \n Adenosine triphosphate, ATP, is the universal energy currency of cells. The breakdown of energy-rich nutrients is coupled to ATP synthesis, allowing temporary energy storage and transfer. When the ATP is later broken back down to ADP or AMP (adenosine diphosphate or monophosphate), it provides energy to power cell reactions such as protein synthesis or cell movement.\n \n Polymer Formation\n \n DNA and RNA polymers are constructed by forming phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides. In this arrangement, a phosphate group acts as a bridge between the 5&#8242; position of one sugar and the 3&#8242; position of the next. This arrangement is called the \"sugar-phosphate backbone\" of DNA or RNA; the bases hang off to the side.\n \n In the cell, DNA or RNA polymers are synthesized using nucleoside triphosphate monomers as precursors. During polymer synthesis, two of the phosphate groups of the incoming nucleoside triphosphate are cleaved off, and this provides the energy needed to power the reaction. The remaining phosphate takes its place in the sugar-phosphate backbone of the growing nucleic acid chain. A pyrophosphate molecule (two linked phosphates) is released.\n \n Just as an arrow has a tip and a tail, DNA or RNA chains have directionality, due to the structure of the sugar. At one end of a chain, a 5&#8242; carbon will be left free. This is known as the 5&#8242; end of the chain. At the other end, the 3&#8242; carbon will be free; this is the 3&#8242; end of the chain. Segments of DNA that are not free at their ends can also be discussed in terms of their 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; ends. This directionality has important consequences. When DNA replication occurs, it always moves from the 5&#8242; end to the 3&#8242; end, and the incoming triphosphate joins the 3&#8242; end of the chain. Transcription (RNA synthesis from a DNA gene) also moves in this 5&#8242;-to-3&#8242; direction. The 5&#8242; end is considered the \"upstream\" end of the gene, and is the end on which the gene promoter (the transcription initiator) is located.\n \n The Double Helix of Dna\n \n In the double helix of DNA, guanine nucleotides are base-paired opposite cytosine nucleotides. Adenine nucleotides are base-paired opposite thymine nucleotides. This pairing is due to the complementary natures of the structures involved. Note that G is a two-ringed purine, while its partner C is a one-ringed pyrimidine. Similarly, A is a purine and T is a pyrimidine. These pairings give the interior of the helix a fixed diameter, without bulges or gaps. Just as importantly, the arrangement of atoms in the rings allows the partners to form sets of weak attractions, called hydrogen bonds, across the interior of the helix. The hydrogen bonds contribute greatly to the stability of the double helix, and the specificity of the G-C, A-T pairing is the structural basis of faithful replication of DNA.\n \n Bibliography\n \n Watson, James.

I re-used that phrase in forming the request to which you have still  failed to provide an answer:\n\n \n \n **\n \"Entropic nucleotide mutation\" is my characterization of what I took you to be talking about. If 'point mutation' and 'nucleotide mutation' do not mean the same thing, then why did you speak as if they did?\n \n If they do mean the same thing, then let me rephrase the question--is a single 'gene' a 'point', and if it is, is such a 'point' a system, and in what sense a 'system'? If a single 'gene' is not sufficient to be categorized or described as a 'point', then what number and configuration of 'genes' constitutes a 'point', and by what criterion? In short, in geneticist argot, what constitutes a 'point', and is a 'point' a 'system'?\n \n And if it is not, but only a 'particle, 'molecule', or a simple aggregation/collection of molecules, then how can the word 'entropy' apply to whatever it is, at all? But if it is a 'system', then in what sense is it systemic? That is, is a 'point' an information[psychical] system, or a thermodynamic[physical] system? \n \n As a materialist you may simply deny, on metaphysical grounds, that 'information', [i.e., meaning, significance, discerned and understood within and from the interrelationships of data], exists, and so, in that sense, deny that 'information' systems exist; only physical, mechanical, thermodynamic systems. In short, that only 'bits of stuff', i.e., atoms, molecules, nucleotides, genes, and so forth exist, and that when the word 'system' is used, it applys strictly to these bits of stuff in motion. But, if you do that, then we will be talking at cross-purposes, and at an impasse.\n \n I bring up all of this 'clarification of terms' issues at this time thanks to the revealed confusion wrt the term, 'gene', itself, as reported in my OP in the thread re the death of NDT [url=http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=10352[/url].\n \n It seems that geneticists have been throwing that term around, with their usual Humpty Dumpty disregard for word meaning, for nearly a hundred years, with no real idea of what they were talking about. I'd prefer that at least in this forum we all knew what we were talking about, and in that sense, were 'all on the same page'.\n \n \n\n Now, we can pussyfoot around rephrasing a perfectly straightforward request than I'm sure everyone here, including you, understands perfectly well, or you can answer it.

Why are you being so evasive?\n \n \n\n If you believe you've answered this already, indirectly, I'd be obliged if you would just reiterate which option you advocate: all nucleotides in a genome being susceptible to random mutation, or some of them being immune to random mutation. Thanks!\n\n \n **\n If by mutation you mean that certain molecules may be unintentionally jostled out of their former positions by some molecular accident or other, or course I do not deny it, and never have. Such a thing is irrelevent to the discussion, however. \n \n \n As I've pointed out before, we are not talking about the geographical location, the 'place', of certain 'bits of stuff'--we are talking about the significance, meaning, that informs the design, pattern, code, sign-system, placing, found in the interrelationship between different, 'bits of stuff'. If a physical redistribution is the only change you are referring to by the word, 'mutation', then, AFAIAC, it is not a difference that makes a difference, is meaningless, and so, who cares? But if the 're-placing' actually changes the 'meaning' expressed by this new 'placement', and it is the change in significance that you mean when you use the word, 'mutation', then it does matter to me. Why? Because the meaning, aka significance, of anything in the genetic code,(as opposed to the 'bits of stuff' [see above] out of which it is constructed), is to be found solely and only in the organism's interpretation of it, as expressed by itself in its own being, in it's own 'traits'. \n \n Therefore 'genetic mutation' is a meaningless term biologically, meaning no more than simply, ' physical/chemical/molecular change in position/place', _unless_ it refers to an organismic change/difference that makes a real difference in and to the organism itself. \n But that would only hold true if every chemical change in the genome linearly and mechanically determined a meaningful trait change in the organism itself. Which is quite simply not the case, generally. But is that which you wish to put forward as a reality in the case of what you call 'point' genetic mutations. I want to know just exactly what you are talking about, because AFAIAC, the answer to your question, in those terms, is absolutely not! \n Why? Because IMO, metaphysically-speaking, a/ systematic change is not random change, b/all productive change is systematic change. c/no productive/adaptive change is random. \n \n OTH, you believe that non-systematic, i'e', 'random/stochastic/accidental' change in a complex sub-system, i.e., a genome, can and does produce, at least sometimes, by pure coincidence, a productive/adaptive change in its uber-system, an organism. That is your metaphysical premise, but you have never been able to support that premise empirically. The onus is on you to 'prove' your premise, because it is 'positive', while I do not have to 'prove' mine, because it is negative.\n \n Your position, as I understand it, is that if we do some 'special pleading', and take the special case of single-celled organsms, forget all about plasmids and other qualities peculiar to the cells of such organisms, and then, further to that, treat eucocial bacteria as if they were simple aggregates of cloned individuals that 'just happen' to clump together geographically, (as they were perceived in the 40's and 50's, instead of as they are now, that is, as demi or semi or supra, organisms in their own right, [I'm not sure which prefix applies]), then we can stipulate a general rule from this anomaly that applies universally to every sort of organism, and to 'evolution', in the entire biosystem.

What are you trying to pull, here?\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Your position, as I understand it, is that if we do some 'special pleading', and take the special case of single-celled organsms, forget all about plasmids and other qualities peculiar to the cells of such organisms, and then, further to that, treat eucocial bacteria as if they were simple aggregates of cloned individuals that 'just happen' to clump together geographically, (as they were perceived in the 40's and 50's, instead of as they are now, that is, as demi or semi or supra, organisms in their own right, [I'm not sure which prefix applies]), then we can stipulate a general rule from this anomaly that applies universally to every sort of organism, and to 'evolution', in the entire biosystem. Which is a logical fallacy. Please correct my impression in the simplest, clearest terms possible, if I am mistaken. \n \n \n My position is that random mutation can happen to any nucleotide in the genome, nothing more - for now anyway.\n\n \n **\n A meaningless \"position\", if it can be called even that. In my last post I showed you exactly why it is meaningless, impertinent, and irrelevent.\n \n \n\n For what I hope is the last time, I invite you to either agree with me, or make the explicit assertion that some nucleotides are not susceptible, that they are immune to the mechanical, external causes of random mutation.\n\n \n **\n I already answered this question in my previous post, when I said,--\n \n \"If by mutation you mean that certain molecules may be unintentionally jostled out of their former positions by some molecular accident or other, or course I do not deny it, and never have. Such a thing is irrelevent to the discussion, however.\"\n \n And then went on to specify just what is relevent to this issue, i.e., _your metaphysical assertion_,-- that is, that accidental, anomalous, irregular, non-systematic random molecular changes in the string of nucleotides called a 'gene' can, and more importantly, do, lead by a strictly unmediated linear set of chemical reactions to a trait change in an organism that is, or will be, coincidentally productive/adaptive in its local environment, or in some other environment that it or its descendents may just possibly find themselves in, at some unknown future date or place. \n \n And my response to that assertion is still totally negative. \n \n And I sincerely hope that this will be the last time that I have to repeat all this to you.",

Instead, perhaps you could provide an answer to the question that's been put to you. It really is a very simple one. Look, I'll even help you decide:\n \n The question of whether random mutation can happen to any nucleotide, or if some are immune, is one of the places where your metaphysic has direct, concrete, unavoidable implications for the nature of reality. We know empirically that a single altered nucleotide can constitute a helpful genetic change, and through extensive biochemical analysis of how an altered gene's function differs from the original, in many cases we also know how it is helpful. The altered gene may be chemically better at maintaining its shape at higher temperatures, for instance - straightforwardly, physically, mechanically, empirically and inevitably helpful in a hotter environment. There are plenty of examples kicking about; I'll find some once we get past this little speed-bump in our discussion.\n \n Your metaphysical position, as you have been less than reticent about stating and restating, is that no helpful mutation can occur accidentally. Since we have, right in front of us, single nucleotide changes that are measurably, understandably, unmysteriously helpful to the organism, correlation between your metaphysic and reality is inextricably bound to the truth of this statement:\n \n \"Some nucleotides are immune to random mutation.\"\n \n All I'm asking you to do, WW, is explicitly make the statement that validates your metaphysic at the real world, genetic, molecular level. This isn't my metaphysic vs yours, this is the extrapolation of your metaphysic, the assertions it makes about the occurrence of real, physical events. So why won't you pony up and put your name behind those assertions?\n \n Or, you can agree with me that all nucleotides in a genome are vulnerable to random mutation, and we can see where that takes us.\n \n So what's it to be?\n \n EDIT: Something tickled my memory, and I found this amongst our old discussions:\n \n \nWW: You meant to say, I'm sure, that the efficient cause of a newly developed adaptive trait in the yeast cell was the direct, linear, inevitable and thus pre-determined result of a biochemical change in the writing of its parent's original inheritance information. But you do nothing to prove this mechanical linearity in a non-linear, self-organizing system like a yeast cell.\n \n Peeling: Apart from inserting that gene into a different yeast cell and observing the same adaptive trait, you mean?\n \n WW: Alright, let's leave genetic determinism in protists alone for a while. I'm not expert in cellular biology, and have no way of countering your assertions of linear mechanical causation in protist cells. But it does seem to me that yeasts are a special case, and that your reasoning from yeast's exceptional genetic properties is an example of 'special pleading' re genetic determinism.\n But for the time being, out of ignorance, I conditionally accept that wrt yeasts and possibly other protists, there exists strong evidence for genetic determinism.\n\n \n So either you've earned your PhD in molecular biology in the intervening span and rocked the scientific world with the results of your studies, or you have no reason not to continue to accept there is strong evidence for at least some degree of genetic determinism in certain living organisms. And empirical determinism (not to mention biochemical analysis of the altered gene's function) means that no matter what the events were leading up to the altered nucleotide, the trait will emerge.\n \n Therefore, for your metaphysic to stand, you must explicitly disallow the alteration of said nucleotide via RM.",

While mine is principally that they CAN, that there is nothing in principle preventing such an event.\n\n \n **\n Well, if the debate is to strictly on the basis of what is possible, we will get nowhere, since you cannot prove that 'they can', unless you submit indisputable empirical proof that they do, and I, aside from the rational proof, 'ex nihilo, ab nihilo, nihil fit', cannot 'prove' that they cannot, then we are at an impasse are forced to agree to disagree unless the isasue is rephrased to say that, on your side, they do 'do that', and on my side, 'no, they do not do that'. This is a proposition that can actually be settled, since it concerns that which actuall is, not that which might possibly be. You should have no objection, because the validation of your argument, both in the metaphysical realm of possibility and in the empirical realm of actuality, hangs upon your presentation of an unequivocal example of an empirically inarguable instance of 'them doing that'. Which, despite some herculean efforts, you have not yet succeeded in doing.\n \n \n\n From that starting point, I might go on to argue that we are therefore free to interpret certain empirical observations in terms of random mutation, when such observations are congruent with our theoretical expectations, but that's a long way down the line as it were and I don't want to get into that just yet.\n\n \n **\n Sorry, but if you think that I am going to accept as fact the suppositions/interpretations/inferences you make that depend upon and are generated by your 'a priori' metaphysical assumptions, it just ain't gonna happen.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n The fact that some single nucleotide changes begin a process that ends with an organismic trait change that is observably, \"measurably, understandably, unmysteriously helpful to the organism\", does not demonstrate the validity of your metaphysical claim, that---\n \n \"Adaptive/productive trait alterations in organisms are _deterministically_ produced by _accidental_ single nucleotide alterations in solitary 'genes'.\" \n \n \n Again, that's only my metaphysic if you replace 'are' with 'can be'.\n\n \n **\n Since you cannot demonstrate, [as above] that such events 'can be' by demonstrating that, in actuality, 'they are', it makes no never mind, except that, as above, if you wish to stick to metaphysical propositions that can only be decided rationally, by logic, then you have already lost, since I have an axiom of logic that shows that I am right and you are wrong.\n \n Therefore, as I've said, if you wish to validate your opinion you must do so empirically, by demonstrating that that which logically is not the case, is the case in actual fact. To do that you are going to have to build an airtight case from established facts, and not suppositions, interpretations, inferences, expectations and other 'beliefs'/ 'points of view'/'generally held opinions'/statements of faith/metaphysical assumptions voiced by the materialist/mechanist community as they interpret reality to suit their metaphysic.\n \n \n\n Make that substitution and it's clear that \"the fact\" you allude to supports it very well. We have our mutually agreed fact that all nucleotides are subject to random mutation, and this other fact that some single nucleotide changes begin a process that ends with a helpful organismic trait change.\n\n \n **\n With three unspoken materialist assumptions built in--1/ that it is possible for you to demonstrate that the mutation is in fact unquestionably a randomly generated effect, 2/that the product of that process is immutable, determined, and inevitable, no matter whether the 'mutation' is accidental or systematic, and 3/ that the process/mechanism that starts with a nucleotide and ends with an organismic trait itself came to be what it is accidentally, randomly, unintentionally, and inevitably, by sole means of determinist mechanical chemistry; a materialist/mechanist series of chemical reactions that could not have failed to make it what it is, to maintain its existence, and to automate it, if necessary or desirable. You have to validate these entailed assumptions if you wish validate the rest, because your 'rest' depends upon them. Good luck with that.\n \n Jumping the gun a bit, I know that, as a darwinist [no matter your denial], you will appeal to the demi-divine, mystical entity, \"Natural Selection\", to supply the intelligence and volition necessary to the formation/origins/evolution of this process. But since \"Natural Selection\", or, \"selection\", as darwinists sometimes call it, is a strictly metaphysical, abstract, and in fact, quasi-religious notion, don't expect me to give it any more credit than darwinists give to the creationist 'god'.\n \n \n \n\n When you put those facts together, things get very interesting.

Empirical evidence does you no good because both our hypotheses explain the evidence and mine is supported by an axiom of logic, whereas yours relies on spontaneous generation. Mathematical formulae or simulations showing how birds fly are just smoke and mirrors, since the formulae were devised based on the assumption that birds are flying unaided.\n \n Yes, of course the application of that axiom to the concept of 'flight' is fallacious- that's the whole point.\n \n \nWith three unspoken materialist assumptions built in--1/ that it is possible for you to demonstrate that the mutation is in fact unquestionably a randomly generated effect, 2/that the product of that process is immutable, determined, and inevitable, no matter whether the 'mutation' is accidental or systematic, and 3/ that the process/mechanism that starts with a nucleotide and ends with an organismic trait itself came to be what it is accidentally, randomly, unintentionally, and inevitably, by sole means of determinist mechanical chemistry; a materialist/mechanist series of chemical reactions that could not have failed to make it what it is, to maintain its existence, and to automate it, if necessary or desirable. You have to validate these entailed assumptions if you wish validate the rest, because your 'rest' depends upon them. Good luck with that.\n\n \n 1. While proving one instance of a particular point mutation unquestionably was random would be useful, even without it we can know to any arbitrary degree of confidence that at least some of them must be.\n \n Here's why: we know empirically that random point mutations happen, yes? And we can estimate how often, on average, one occurs somewhere in the genome (either per generation, or per timeslice). We have agreed that no nucleotide is immune - therefore, there is a finite and estimable probability of a mutation occurring to the one particular nucleotide that we're interested in. We can extrapolate that across a population and make a statement about the probability of that mutation occurring randomly, one or more times, somewhere in the population in a given period. As the population gets larger, that probability approaches 1.0.\n \n By a striking coincidence, the point at which population size and number of generations starts to yield predicted probabilities close to 1.0 is the same point at which we start to see actual adaptive mutants appearing. (And by the way, to pre-empt a claim that the ability to form those mutants is a eusocial one 'unlocked' by bigger colonies, we expose the same total number of adaptive mutants if we split up a colony into a number of small ones and test them individually. Hence, it's not a eusocial response)\n \n To cap it all, you've already said that in extremis bacteria relax their error-correction systems - what would be the point if the errors themselves couldn't be beneficial? Everything - from statistical analysis, to observations of hypermutational states - confirms that accidental induction of the specific genetic change involved almost certainly does occur. Whether there's any statistical room left over to admit cases of deliberate, volitional induction is another issue entirely.\n \n In short, whatever your metaphysical 'can't happen' means in terms of real-world events, it isn't the random occurrence of the mutation.\n \n 2. and 3. I'll tackle later, once we've sorted out 1.",

Neither does the term stochastic exclude systems which bind information about their environment by random variation and feedback via natural selection. Neither does heuristic do so.\n \n \n RM-NS is a stochastic process which is rendered heuristic by the inclusion of natural selection. The genome is indirectly informed of the environment by the simple fact that different variants survive differentially. The process requires no intelligence and no EXOGENOUS agency other than the environment itself which is just that - the environment which is of course NOT an intelligent agency (although it is exogenous to the organisms).\n \n Under EAM you claim that somehow the genome is modified by the organism in an intelligent way so as to match the environmental optima or at least move toward it. In other words there is no random variation or so it seems from your words. That too would be heuristic but it involves DIRECT feedback from the environment to the organism and thence in a non random way to the organisms genome. Natural selection does not enter the picture. Random mutation does not enter the picture. In effect you require the organism to have the capacity to design itself to be optimum with its environment and all the feedback is directly through the phenotype. The problem you face is of course that most organisms simply lack the onboard intelligence to accomplish this at all and thus you must needs be invoke an external intelligence - something for which there is zip evidence or else merely ASSERT without evidence that organisms DO have sufficient onboard intelligence to do the trick . A selective breeder in the sky does not as far as anyone knows exist and an intelligent bacterium is an absurdity. In other words you lack any support for your theory either logical or empirical.\n \n And even intelligent organisms - such as yourself? are not exactly proficient at changing their geneome to match their environment. For example next time it gets cold take a long walk outside without a coat. Continue this is a habit until you have a child. Put the child outside in the winter without anything but a diaper and see how it handles the exposure! According to you all should be well. I rather think it will not be so.",

No volition required or permitted. Well, you can decide whether or not to flip the coin, but you don't get to choose the answer, and you don't get to decide to roll dice instead once you have started.\n \n Heuristic = aid to problem-solving, trial-and-error, or exploratory and self-educating, hence in each case directed and volitional. At every step, the choice of what to try next is based on the results of the previous step, or the chain of previous steps. Choice, hence volition, is required. In a heuristic program, the rule for choosing the next step comes out of the volition of the programmer, even though the programmer does not know in advance which choices the program will make. \n \n No more than Hitler knew which Jews Eichmann would have killed when he gave the orders, or again than Eichmann knew which Jews would be taken to the camps and gassed or otherwise disposed of. They were still responsible. Not that I would compare computer programmers with Nazi murderers in any personal way. They have, after all, quite different goals in mind.\n \n So anyway, random (non-volitional) and heuristic (volitional) processes are by definition mutually exclusive. QED.\n \n The term heuristic does not exclude stochastic and the term stochastic does not exclude heuristic! Neither does the term stochastic exclude systems which bind information about their environment by random variation and feedback via natural selection. Neither does heuristic do so.\n \n So you say.

   "Have you ever worked with monte-carlo methods on computers? At the core they are stochastic, but they are also heurestic in that they are methods of solving problems. Evolution involves elements of both and when combined they result in climbing the local fittness peak within the limits of variability available. Perhaps you noticed the etymology of stochastic?\n \n \nEtymology: Greek stochastikos skillful in aiming, from stochazesthai to aim at, guess at, from stochos target, aim, guess \n \n Etymology: German heuristisch, from New Latin heuristicus, from Greek heuriskein to discover; akin to Old Irish fo-f&#250;air he found\n\n \n These two are not incompatible.

If you wish to consider natural selection as being heuristic then from whence do you obtain the volition? Unless you are a theistic evolutionist and you postulate that a GOD (or other exogenous source of volition) somehow set the goal (\"go forth and survive and reproduce and fill the earth?\") in the beginning and simply turned the first imperfect replicators loose to do their thing. But when you do that you get into the ultimate causes business and thats not the scientific (or logical) approach. But consider that such a goal need not be set externally as it is already the case that linages which are more fit will by definition survive and reproduce to a greater extent than others. The \"goal\" arises from the structure of the universe itself. Of course one can then argue that GOD still did it since He presumably set up the universe and so forth and so on. But one need not get tangled up in ultimate causes - its always a wild goose chase. By the way did you notice the use of trial and error methods under the definition of heuristic?

Some have toes and toenails (or claws), some don't. Sea mammals may have functional feet (sea otters), or vestigial feet, in those whose ancestors have been at sea the longest (whales), with a spectrum of intermediate forms.\n \n Why, according to a Creationist, does a whale have leg and foot bones inside its body where it can't use them for anything? Why, in fact, is the whole world full of many billions of known facts that indicate a common descent of all life (such as the detailed match between so much human and chimp DNA, or human and bacterial DNA, or even human and viral DNA/RNA)? Is God a practical joker? Is he/she/it/they setting us an insoluble puzzle on purpose? How would this make us better people?\n\n \n you didn't answer my question.....ToE says all structures evolved by small, random modifications. Surely, then you are not saying that whole structures such as feet formed complete...that would be a contradiction now wouldn't it.....so answer my question:\n \n what about the feet? which foot came first?

Horses with one hoof represent a reduction from five toes to the middle toe. Artiodactyls (cows, sheep, deer, giraffe, antelope, etc.) with cloven hooves represent reduction of toes from five to two (#s 3 & 4).\n \n Running on tiptoe lengthens your stride and makes you faster. In effect, the ancestors of perissodactyls (horses) and artiodactyls both started with all five toes on the floor. (Put your hand on a table with all five digits touching the surface). Now rotate your hand forward so that you are more on tinger tips. Now rotate a little more so that your thumb and little finger are no longer touching the table. Now rotate forward a little more and your fingers 2 & 4 lose contact, and your hand is \"standing\" on the middle finger. That's basically what horses did. \n \n Start over with all five fingers touching the table. Now rotate forward and outward so that the thumb loses contact, but the remaining four don't. Now rotate forward again so that fingers 5 & 2 lose contact. You are now 'standing' on fingers 3 & 4, This is what artiodactyls did.\n \n We have fossils of all stages (five toes, three toes, one toe, in the horse line, and five, four, and two in the artiodactyl line). As soon as a toe fails to touch the ground it become unneccessary and is subject to shrinking and loss, and we have fossils of those stages as well.\n http://laelaps.wordpress.com/2007/09/13/the-branching-bush-of-horse-evolution/\n \n \n \n To SS \nThere are more to feet and other body parts besides bone...muscles, tendons, toenails....did all these evolve at the same time from the same mutation?\n\n Not exactly, but if a mutation causes a limb bone to grow longer, canalization wiill ensure that the muscles still attach in the right places and that the muscles and nerves and veins wil all grow appropriately longer. You do not need to have a million separate fortunate mutations to handle all the associated details. All this this is old stuff, learned long ago from experiments in canalization.\n \n Fish fossils from the Devonian show that fin-base bones came first, and with losses of some fin-base bones and fusing together and/or strengthening of the ones that remained, the hip / shoulder, the humerus / femur, and the tibia-fibula / radius-ulna were developed, all while the fish essentially had a fin at the end of its limb. Middle fin pairs were lost, creating fore and aft quadrupedal limbs. Wrist and ankle bones developed from the myriad of lepidotrichia support bones. Finally, digits developed (up to ten per limb, or possibly more), even though they were not yet used for walking on land. This too was a pattern of loss: from hundreds of miniscule fin rays to a few dozen that were thicker, and down to the 5 to 10 that characterized the earliest amphibians known so far.\n http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2006/04/tiktaalik_limb_lg.jpg\n http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/04/tiktaalik_makes_another_gap.php\n \n In terms of numbers of paired fins and numbers of fin rays per fin, the succession has been first duplicated, then it experienced a combination of reductions and specializations.",

   "\n Quote:\n The day that EAM, or anything else, becomes \"volitional[ly] stochastic\", I'll give up on reason, sanity, logic, and the English language. \"Heuristic\" does not mean \"stochastic\", not even if you arbitrarily, and oxymoronically, stick, 'volitional' in front of it. \n \n \n A lottery draw is a volitional (deliberate, voluntary) stochastic (outcome is unbiased) event. \n\n \n **\n You are still suffering from, \"The Darwinist's Disease\", a mental disability that may not be restricted to darwinists, but be endemic among all materialists.\n \n I speak of the inability of darwinists to distinguish between the _cause_ of an event, and the _effect_of that cause in that event. We see this with darwinists all the time, whereby a cause is mistaken for its effect, or an effect is taken to be its own cause, or the same thing is called a 'cause' when it suits them, but an 'effect' when that suits them better. It all started with chuck and his \"Natural Selection\", wherebye an effect[populations fluctuate statistically and relatively] was put forward as a cause for itself.\n Then \"Fitness\" was played the same way. We usually see it expressed by bumper-stickers as \"Survival of the fittest.\". I have even had darwinists tell me, and the rest of the world, that the evolution of a certain organismic trait was 'caused' by 'evolution'!!! And repeatedly I have heard them claim that 'selection' generates the traits that are selected by \"Natural Selection\".\n What a ship of fools these darwinists be, and how preposterous their arrogant condescending attitude towards those of us wqho actually know how to think!!\n \n Here, again, we have another instance where the the proper distinction between the cause of an event, and the 'ffect' involved in that event, are not properly distinguished. This time wrt to the application of the word, \"stochastic\", and the darwinist failure to understand that a stochastic cause and a stochastic effect/outcome, ARE NOT THE SAME THING!!! And that when one is speakinmg of causal mechanisms, such as the 'cause' of evolution, in general or in particular, then the words involved must apply to the cause, not the final effect.\n \n Now darwinists always speak in terms of effects, even when they think they are speaking of causes. They think like census-takers. The statistics of effects become, for them, the causes of those statistical effects. In particular instances they will sometimes do as the rest of us do, namely infer either a universal cause for a universal effect, or a particular cause for a particular effect, but unlike us, they will never 'test' a universal cause for a universal effect, and very often they will leave the 'just-so' story they 'inferred' from a particular effect equally untested, unverified. Worse, they are quite amenable, when even a 'just-so' story escapes their imaginations, to dismiss causality altogether with a hand-wave that amounts to nothing more than, \"It just 'happens', that's all!\". Which is the materialist \"explanation\"(DUH!!) for existence in general.\n \n IAC, wrt to a lottery, the spin of a roulette whell, or just a simple throw of the dice, the cause is not stochastic, but deliberate, systematic [rule-governed] and goal-directed. Such events, spoken of in terms of causality, are heuristic, not stochastic. The range of possible outcome is restricted and defined by this, their causation. The results are not 'stochastic', i.e., open-ended, but if darwinists and statisticians wish to refer to all events, or series of events, that have outcomes/results that are not mechanically pre-determined and 'specifically predictable' as 'stochastic', let them. Apart from extremely rare, ususually highly-controlled series of events, such as experiments, such mechanical pre-determinism is comparitively rare in nature, and waters down and dilute the significance of the word 'stochastic' by simple reason of over-extended usage. If any outcome that is not mechanically pre-determined, specified, immutable, and inevitable is 'stochastic', then practically everything is 'stochastic', or, as materialists really believe, nothing is. That is why they must apply the word 'stochastic' with the meaning, 'unknown', to outcomes, even where the causes are quite obvious, and then call the entire 'change event', stochastic, regardless of the nature of the causation involved. But the rest of us are free to distinguish between 'stochastic' [accidental or indeterminable] causation and 'heuristic'[systematic] causation wrt events/processes, from lotteries to evolution, and I will continue to exercise that right. \n \n Quote:\n \"Stochastic\" refers to 'an unbiased series of events' \n \n \n ...and that's it. The ensuing dictionary-dump, though it represents what you want the word to imply, is inaccurate.[/quote]\n \n **\n Oh, yeah, of course. I forgot. The dictionary and I are wrong, because we don't say what you want us to say, and you, being a darwinist, are always right about what words mean, by automatic default. Duh! Such hubris!!\n \n \n\n Were we to accept it we would find ourselves unable to describe something as simple as a lottery draw,\n\n \n **\n That's silly! Whyever not?!? A lottery draw is an intelligent, volitional, systematic heuristic process for discriminating a one individual [a winner] from the sum of all members recognised as belonging to the specified set involved[ticket-holders]. 'Picking a winner', we call this goal-directed, heuristic activity. Tossing a coin is equally heuristic, if and when which side turns up has any significance at all. Who the winner is is usually irrelevent to to the actual lottery process, and if it isn't, then something stinks.\n \n \n\n or a volitional heuristic where only the filter, and not the variation, is statistically biased towards a goal.\n\n \n **\n I fail to see your problem with this, either. For one thing, it is impossible to have this situation as you state it, since any 'volitional heuristic' is somehow responsible for the the 'variation' involved. Such as the design of the dice, the numbers attached to sold tickets in lotteries, and so on. Unless you turn to some causal force that is entirely unintentional, you will not have heuristic, but rather, 'stochastic' causation. However, in this instance, if 'selection', or 'filtering' or 'discrimination' of amny kind is put in place at this stage, then that which is 'stochastically caused' become an heuristic, goal-directed event, because you have added another level of causation, intentional causation, so that, once again the final effects/outcomes, though not specified, are goal-directed. \n \n \n\n I don't see any benefit in adopting a revised definition of a word if that revision impairs our ability to describe the world around us.\n\n \n **\n Neither do I, so I'll stick with the dictionary definition, thanks. Playing at Humpty Dumpty I'll leave to the darwinists and their statistician/population geneticists.\n \n \n\n In any case, this is hardly the meat of the issue. \n \n You've agreed that random mutations can happen to all nucleotides (and empirically, such events tend to happen during cell division when the bases are exposed. 'Can happen' implies a real-world finite probability, which can be estimated from the total number of mutations between generations and the size of the genome to which they occur.\n\n \n **\n Once again, you are referring to outcomes, effects, and not causes. Random effects DO NOT stipulate/entail/decree/force/require that their causes be random.\n Unless, a priori, from a metaphysical assumption, you state that ALL genetic mutations are, by their very nature, random/accidental/stochastic, then the relation between the total number of genes in a genome, and the total number of possible mutations, is nothing but a mathematical correlation.\n It has no significance unless and until the total actual/empirical number of mutations significantly differs from this mathematical/abstract quantity.\n More to the point, you assume that all genes are created equal, and that that all genes 'mutate' at the same 'random' rate, which as you know full well, is not true at all. Some genes 'mutate' sometimes, some genes almost never mutate. How does 'random causation' account for that? Are some 'genes' just 'extra-tuff', or something? \n \n \n\n Say for the sake of argument that probability is one in a hundred million (a not unrealistic figure based on observations). Over the course of one billion cell divisions (which a single population of bacteria can peform in well under an hour) the odds of it happening at least once are around 99.995%.\n\n \n **\n I do not know what you mean by \"it\", but if you are referring to a particular nucleotide undergoing a random change, that figure just is not determinable. The actual empirical fact, as noted above, is that the nucleotides of all genes DO NOT mutate at one standard rate, and that makes your arithmetic an exercise in futility. So the \"odds\" of any particular nucleotide mutating are relative to what gene it is a part of. The \"odds\" of a gene for resistance to streptomycin arising in a colony of e.coli., whether there is an immediate and proximate local exposure to streptomyces, is practically '1'. A virtual certainty. The genes for metabolizing nylon, uhm, not so much.\n \n \n\n Unless you feel like betting against those odds, I'd appreciate an acknowledgement that we can be almost absolutely sure that random accidents do lead to genetic changes of the kind we're talking about.\n\n \n **\n What odds?! So far you're just blowing smoke!\n \n \n\n Obviously I still haven't shown they'll result in an adaptive trait arising - that'll be the hard part All I'm after for know is your acceptance that these events do occur, since our observations indicate it would be almost inconceivably unlikely that they do not.\n\n \n **\n Well, your \"observations\" are founded upon your metaphysics, and are at best, dubious. I'm a sceptical kinda guy, me self. Now, I cannot \"prove\" that accidental unsystematic anomalous nucleotide changes 'cannot' result in adaptive organismic traits, purely by coincidence, but I have every rational right to make that claim. It is basedsoundly upon the logical axiom that denies magic--that is, 'ex nihilo, ab nihilo, nihil fit'. I cannot 'prove' my assertion because it is impossible to \"prove\" a negative proposition. The 'ex nihilo' axiom itself cannot be \"proven\", but does not need to be, since it is a self-evident fact, and facts not only do not need to be proven, they cannot be proven, but only discovered. But that is not my problem. Anyone is allowed to be sceptical about a dubious claim of any kind, and your claim is dubious.\n \n The only problem is yours. Your 'mechanism' for evolution depends upon your positive, but dubious, assertion, that not only can random nucleotide changes [genetic mutations] generate, mechanically, in linear, unassisted fashion, novel organismic traits that are, or will be in future, coincidentally adaptive/productive wrt some local environmental condition, but also that they do so with such regularity that they can be held up as the 'mechanism' upon which evolution depends.

But if the effects are stochastic, what are our grounds for inferring, as you do, a non-stochastic cause? \n \n Hypermutational response mechanisms relax error correcting protocols. The inescapable conclusion of this is that the exogenous, random mutations those protocols defend against is a source of the mutations we're talking about; the ones associated with potentially helpful traits. \n \n The organisms themselves empirically disagree with you, WW; why try to make it sound like it's just silly old darwinist me?\n \n \nOh, yeah, of course.

A lottery draw is an intelligent, volitional, systematic heuristic process for discriminating a one individual [a winner] from the sum of all members recognised as belonging to the specified set involved[ticket-holders]\n\n \n No, it isn't a heuristic, because a lottery defines the winner, it does not find one. Heuristic, from the greek heuriskein, to find. \n \n Entertaining though this is, again, it's not really central to the issue.\n \n \nOnce again, you are referring to outcomes, effects, and not causes. Random effects DO NOT stipulate/entail/decree/force/require that their causes be random.\n\n \n Just one verb would suffice, WW. Whether it's possible for a non-random system to generate random output is a potentially interesting subject - however, what random effects do do is permit random causation.\n \n You've often gloated about how I've never managed to produce unambiguous, empirical proof of a random mutation being adaptive. But let's turn that around. Picture a Venn diagram, with 'observations of mutation expected and permitted under RM' and 'observations of mutation permitted under EAM.' The former circle would fit entirely within the latter, with the latter also permitting observations of strongly directed and biased mutation. \n \n Isn't it strange how absolutely all the thousands - possibly millions - of experiemental observations ever made fit completely within that tiny inner circle, with not one unambiguously EAM-only observation having ever been made?\n \n \nMore to the point, you assume that all genes are created equal, and that that all genes 'mutate' at the same 'random' rate, which as you know full well, is not true at all. \n\n \n Sorry, I just assumed you knew that already; I didn't say, nor did I intend to imply, that all loci were equally susceptible to RM.\n \n \nSome genes 'mutate' sometimes, some genes almost never mutate. How does 'random causation' account for that? Are some 'genes' just 'extra-tuff', or something? \n\n \n Random causation doesn't, of course: the inherent chemical properties of the gene and its location in the genome (eg deep inside the chromosome or on an exposed, tightly kinked extremity) do. Take HIV, a virus and therefore something which, according to your own words, evolves via RM. It possesses one chemically unstable, highly mutable gene.\n \n \nI do not know what you mean by \"it\", but if you are referring to a particular nucleotide undergoing a random change, that figure just is not determinable. \n\n \n But it isn't zero, as you've already agreed. And it is estimable:\n \n Say we measure mutation rates (including at that locus), introduce or elevate a mutagen whose chemical effect we understand, and observe what happens. If that locus fails to mutate detectably more often, ok, you've got yourself a ball game. But if the rate does increase in line with other sites, we can be sure RM is playing a part at the locus in question. Heck, even if it wasn't happening before, it sure is now!\n \n Wouldn't you agree? That if we introduce UV or some chemical mutagen and observe elevated rates across the board, including at that locus, with no hypermutational response being involved, that's pretty good evidence that at the very least the additional mutations are being exogenously induced?\n \n Add that evidence to the bacteria's own error-permitting hypermutational response and it's pretty clear cut: random mutation not only can but does occur at sites empirically associated with potentially helpful mutations.\n \n \nThe \"odds\" of a gene for resistance to streptomycin arising in a colony of e.coli., whether there is an immediate and proximate local exposure to streptomyces, is practically '1'.\n\n \n I think you mean 'whether or not' there is an immediate and proximate local exposure, as I've demonstrated time and time again. Or have you already forgotten the experiment where a pure resistant strain was cultivated without ever exposing the bacteria in that culture to the antibiotic?\n \n \nThe genes for metabolizing nylon, uhm, not so much.\n\n \n Sure, mainly because that requires a double mutation.\n \n \nNow, I cannot \"prove\" that accidental unsystematic anomalous nucleotide changes 'cannot' result in adaptive organismic traits, purely by coincidence, \n\n \n So in other words, based on all the considerable physical evidence at our disposal, it's a hypothesis that fits.\n \n \nbut I have every rational right to make that claim. It is basedsoundly upon the logical axiom that denies magic--that is, 'ex nihilo, ab nihilo, nihil fit'.\n\n \n Well, we'll get to that shortly.\n \n What I am very much interested to hear is your explanation for why organisms disagree with your logical axiom, at least as far as the actual genetic change-stage is concerned.

   "\n Well, quite. But if the effects are stochastic, what are our grounds for inferring, as you do, a non-stochastic cause?\n\n \n **\n In any change event, the effects are stochastic if, and only if, all causation involved is stochastic. Any direction, limitation, or control renders all effects the heuristic results of an heuristic process.\n I have explained this to you repeatedly, but you wish to insist that in any change event the presence of any unknown variable and/or any degree of non-determinist unpredictanility renders the results, and indeed the entire process, 'stochastic'. I refuse to accept your position, as I think you define words such as 'random', 'chance', and 'stochastic' according to the precepts of a materialist/mechanist metaphysic that is essentially and inescapably determinist.\n \n IAC, assumption [not inference] of a non-stochastic [at least heuristic] process [heuristic effects from heuristic causes] whenever a genetic mutation results in an adaptive organismic trait is simply based, as I have told you a million times, on the logical axiom, 'ex nihilo, ab nihilo, nihil fit', or 'you can't get blood from a stone', or 'you can't get a novel productive function from a complex system by stochastically altering one or more parts of a complex productive system, therebye diminishing its productivity, and expecting some coincidentally stochastic environmental change event to balance things out, coincidentally making the loss of systemic productivity into a gain in systemic productivity, 'two negatives making a positive', or 'two wrongs making a right' fashion. That is quite simply an appeal to magic, and is simply superstitious.\n \n The \"nihilo\" does not forbid meaningless and/or negative/subtractive stochastic effects from purely stochastic causation in a complex productive system. In fact it expects it, even requires it. The only time that an _assumption_ of non-stochastic causation [genetic mutation] need ever be made is if and when a novel organismic trait increases an organism's productivity in terms of the standard life goals--survive, thrive, and if possible, reproduce.\n \n None of which is the issue in this debate. For the umpteenth time, the issue is not what is not possible or what cannot be done--the issue is that cornerstone of RMNS Fisherian darwinism, NDT, MET, or however you wish to label the ruling orthodoxy on the mechanism by which evolution takes place.\n \n The issue is, therefore, what are _your_ grounds for assuming, as you do, stochastic causation in cases of adaptive, productive outcomes in complex productive systems, especially in live, organismic biosystems?\n \n \n \n\n Hypermutational response mechanisms relax error correcting protocols. The inescapable conclusion of this is that the exogenous, random mutations those protocols defend against is a source of the mutations we're talking about; the ones associated with potentially helpful traits.\n\n \n **\n No, that is your assumption, but it is not any \"inescapable conclusion\", not by a long chalk. What you call \"protocols\" are \"rules\", and rules/protocols are what make some interactions, 'systematic', i.e., ordered and non-stochastic. That is, systematic. Stress induces a systematic endogenous response in biosystems. Such systematic responses are not stochastic causes. Stochastic causes can only diminish, weaken, or outright destroy the productivity in a complex productive system. But heuristic/systematic control turns stochastic[unpredictable, non-directional, unbiased] input into a part of an heuristic [directed, biased] process, making the final effects, [provided that the stochastic/entropic causes don't totally destroy the system first] heuristic, not stochastic.\n \n \n\n The organisms themselves empirically disagree with you, WW; why try to make it sound like it's just silly old darwinist me?\n\n \n \n **\n Because it is manifestly untrue to say that \"the organisms themselves empirically disagree with [me]\", when in fact they quite plainly do no such thing.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Oh, yeah, of course. I forgot. The dictionary and I are wrong, \n \n \n The dictionary? Please, show me a dictionary that defines stochastic the way you do, including words like 'ateleological' and 'involuntary'.\n\n \n **\n I've already cited a dictionary. There, 'stochastic' is tied to randomness, as in 'random variables'. Like it or not, nothing that is, per se, 'random', including anything that is, per se, 'stochastic', can be teleological or voluntary. That would involve a contradiction in terms, which those of us who think that words should convey real meaning just cannot let slide by.\n \n Do you really need to have everything spelled out for you? It seems so, but when I put in great effort to make explicit those things which darwinists prefer to keep nebulous, vague, and 'taken for granted', I am criticised for overuse of modifiers and limiters. To be expected, of course. God forbid that the lurkers find out just how much darwinist arguments depend upon assumption and insinuation instead of evidence and plain-speaking.\n \n Break time.",

Change is in the nature of existence, and all forms of existence are subject to accidental change. Use the word 'mutation' in place of 'change' if that pleases you, but it makes no difference. \n The 'changing' of 'bits of stuff' is different from the 'changing' of whole systems, although you do not seem able to accept that fact. 'Genes', whatever they are, and particularly nucleotides, are 'bits of stuff'. Genomes are systems but not independent systems. They are the sub-systems of the uber-system, the organism. If you want to talk about how nucleotides are shifted about over time, fill yer boots. But I'm here to talk about how and why organisms evolve. Your 'a priori' assumption that any change in any nucleotide can, and usually does, lead, linearly and mechanically[deterministically], to a corresponding alteration in the uber-system is simply unfounded. True, accidental nucleotide shifts happen, and sometimes these set in motion chemical reactions that the genome's control mechanism's fail to deal with, and that the organism's cellular mechanisms fail tyo deal with and that the organism entire cannot or does not deal with, and this results in some kind of organismic alteration. But these alterations in the uber-system, if they are not dealt with, it is because they are so trivially inconsequential, overall, that they can be allowed to 'slide by'. They do not concern us.\n \n What does concern us are the consequential, significant alterations that take place, for better or worse, in a 'mutated' organism. That is, those trait modifications that are either a/adaptive/productive, and those that are b/maladaptive/destructive. You say that both outcome a/ and outcome b/ can, and regularly do, result from the exact same cause--i.e., an accidental shift in the position or kind of a nucleotide in a 'gene' in a genome in a cell in an organism. That is, you say that whether you get a/ or b/ is nothing to do with the system/s itself, but is dependent upon and relative to the external conditions of the environment. The environment decides, or, as you guys put it, 'nature [whatever that means] selects'. And that 'selection', which must be always, by its very nature, negative and subtractive, i.e., must always choose b/ and leave a/ untouched, gets full credit for the 'origin and preservation' of a/!! Which is ridiculous!\n \n Of course, as soon as this \"NS\" 'mechanism is so ridiculed, you 'pull a dawkins', and insist that the environment is not really in charge of evolution, as per \"NS\", but rather, it is the bits of acid, nucleotides, that make up 'genes' that are found in genomes in cells that are in charge of organismic evolution! Anything, anything, anything to avoid the realization that the organism is that which is really in charge of its, the organism's, evolution, [or lack of it]. \n And that is where we stand at this point in this discussion. You, the dawkinsian advocate of evolution by 'selfish gene' acting as a 'blind watchmaker', and me, saying that that hypothesis really makes no sense to me. Can you demonstrate it empirically, or is this just a case of who can come up with the most colourful literary metaphors in lieu of science?\n \n And you call my scepticism, \"inexplicable\"?!? I find your credulity to be explicable solely in terms of needing to believe that which does not undermine your metaphysic, and most importantly, the 'atheist' part of that metaphysic.\n \n \n\n The hypermutational response mechanism supplies that evidence, for although it is itself systemic, the errors it refrains from correcting are the same exogenously induced, stochastic mistakes the organism experiences all the time. By the time the HMRM has any say in the process, the genetic change is already done and dusted.\n\n \n **\n No, it is not. Even in cases of of eusocial, multi-celled hypermutation, as in e. coli. bacteria, the final outcome is an organismic matter; that is, it is the more advantageous mutations, the more productive/adaptive mutations that are first, most plentifully generated by the individual cells, [as empirically observed], and second, it is the single most adaptive/productive cellular 'mutation' that is incorporated into the evolving colonial uber-organism.\n You suggest that under hyper-mutation, systemic controls over gene expression are completly dropped, and that everything and anything can 'get through' just as easily as anything else. That is just another hopeful supposition on your part, and one that does not stand up to scrutiny. The fact is, only the 'best available' genetic options get to the cellular level, and only the best of those reach the colonial, organismic level. Your assertion, above, is utterly unwarranted.\n \n \n\n For this systemic behaviour to make any sense at all, those exogenously induced, random mistakes must include genetic changes at loci we empirically associate with adaptive traits.\n\n \n **\n As always, you stick to the fisherian/dawkinsian assumption that an accidental change in a nucleotide leads irrevocably, mechanically, invariably, inevitably, deterministically, to a certain and particular alteration in an organism. Nothing in modern genomics, or all of molecular biology, supports this antique notion.\n \n \n\n So, before we move on to talking about subsequent stages on the road to hose adaptive traits, will you accept that random genetic changes not only can, but clearly do occur at the loci in question?\n\n \n **\n I keep telling you that they can and do occur at certain 'loci', but that that is utterly irrelevent to the point [i.e., adaptedness],unless and until you can demonstrate that the genetic, 'locus', per se, all by itself, mechanically determines the final organismic outcome in cases where that outcome is productive/adaptive. You keep beating your dead horse, that is, your unfounded, and in fact generally contra-indicated, supposition that if a final outcome at the organismic trait level can be correlated with a mutation at a certain locus, then any mutation at that locus, at any time and from any cause, must always, inevitably, deterministically, linearly, mechanically, lead to the exact same organismic trait mutation, no matter what else is going on. \n This is a mistake, and a mistake thatthat darwinists make repeatedly, i.e., they mistake correlation for causation, and that is just a plain and simple fallacy. \n \n In order for you to establish empirically that your genetic determinist position is correct, you would have to demonstrate the truth of your premise that any 'mutation' occurring at a certain genetic 'locus' always and everywhere, every time, leads inexorably to the exact same organismic 'mutation'. But it would seem to me that modern genomics tells us that is not the case at all, whereas unless it is the case 100% of the time, then your poor dead horse deserves a break, and the question of whether or not mutations can and do occur at any locus is an irrelevent red herring.\n \n \n \n\n To claim otherwise is to deny the usefulness of the hypermutational response mechanism.\n\n \n **\n Nonsense. The \"HMRM\"'s utility does not depend upon 100% withdrawal of cellular correction mechanisms. To the contrary, 100% loss of control, allowing a purely stochastic process, would be highly destructive to any complex, rule-governed system. \"Loosening\" control is not \"losing\" control, unless you are limited to a mindset of false dichotomies; eg., free/determined, mechanical/random, natural/supernatural, and so forth.",

Which is ridiculous!\n\n \n Well, don't forget that the 'environment' in this equation does factor in the organism's own actions and decisions, such as they may be. But sometimes - not always by any means, but sometimes - it really is as clear-cut as a mutation being both sufficient and necessary for the processing of a particular nutrient. If that nutrient is present and others are deficient, the organism will prosper relative to its peers, full stop.\n \n And for the hojillionth time, selection is not credited with the origin of 'a'! You've just described its origin yourself; if someone without the slightest interest in the ToE can get it right, why do you insist that 'darwinists' get it wrong? :)\n \n \n\n No, it is not.

And that's empirical fact.\n \n \nYou suggest that under hyper-mutation, systemic controls over gene expression are completly dropped, and that everything and anything can 'get through' just as easily as anything else.\n\n \n Not 'completely dropped', but certainly they become less successful at repairing errors. The rest is right, though: when adaptive mutants that have undergone hypermutation have their DNA sequenced, we find that mutations have accumulated at an elevated rate across the genome. Indeed, when we compare the actual number of such hypermutated survivors with the number we would expect to have appeared given the degree of elevation, we find less survivors - because many have experienced catastrophic mutations and died.\n \n \nThat is just another hopeful supposition on your part, and one that does not stand up to scrutiny. The fact is, only the 'best available' genetic options get to the cellular level, and only the best of those reach the colonial, organismic level.

   "\n Quote:[ww]\n I keep telling you that they can and do occur at certain 'loci', \n \n \n Well, no, you agreed they can, and then shut the door in my face when I suggested that they actually do.\n\n \n **\n Please go back and reread for comprehension. I did not deny, or affirm, that they 'did', because I only have your word for it that they do. I did affirm that they 'could', and so presumably, 'would', on occasion. But most importantly I affirmed, for the gazillionth time, that it does not matter to our issue whether or or not certain 'loci' are subject to accidental/entropic dislocation. I do not care if they are sometimes accidentally altered or not, since we know from modern genomics that that the identity of 'genes' and the 'traits' they cue for are not mechanically determined, andsince they are not mechanically determined is does not matter whether or not you can find some statistical correlation between a particular nucleotide and a particular trait, or not. We went over this many times wrt L&D'43, where you claimed that the repeated mutation that led to resistance was 'random', despite the fact that it is obviously systematic. You tried the same thing recently with L&L '51,-- [a piece of work that Joshua Lederberg is not all that proud of, apparently, since it does not turn up at his website, so far as I can tell]. The fact that a nucleotide can and does change does not tell why it changed, and just assuming, as darwinists always have, that random but specific genetic change must lead irresistably to some specific organismic change, 1 to 1, linearly, chemically, mechanically, deterministicly, is simply no longer credible in the light of modern molecular biology, genomics, or whatever. But without that now outdated assumption, the notion that adaptive traits can arise from genetic accidents does not hold water. Simply because, after discovering a repeating mutation that alternately leads to and from a costly but effective trait, such as e.coli.'s resistance, you try to argue backwards to that mutation arising and being adaptive as a matter of pure accident, simply because you can now deliberately bombard the poor bacteria with x-rays or whatever, and so induce that same mutation. But what you can do now that the mutation has been systematized gives no grounds whatsoever for saying that that mutation originally arose by bombarding e.coli. with x-rays, or by any other purely accidental means. \n \n Modern genomics tells us that nucleotides, genes, are ways of coding for traits, and that, at least chemically, that coding can be different for the same trait, or the same for different traits, and so now it is apparent to everyone but darwinists that the chemicals are not in charge here--that they are mere tools that do as they are told, recording for posterity certain very helpful and indeed, very often vital bits of infomation. Information that can be 'written' in different ways, or different information that can be, in chemical terms, 'written' using the exact same symbology.In light of that, continuing to insist that the original mutation, as per e.coli., arose accidentally by genetic mutation, [rather than was simply 'written' that way by an organism learning to protect itself from an ancient and constant enemy, streptomyces], just because, millions of years after it was originated/evolved, lab teks can now turn on this mutation intentionally, with radiation, simply does not hold water.\n \n \n \n\n Nice to know we're finally on the same page.\n\n \n **\n Well, I keep telling you why we are not on the same page at all, and you keep trying to distort what I say instead of coming to grips with it, so I really don't believe that you and I will ever reach an understanding on this.\n \n \n\n So, when we move on to talking about the way in which a particular mutation proves advantageous in the context of the organism, there won't be any 'that mutation couldn't have happened at random' protests, will there? We're past that now, yes? RM does induce these changes.\n\n \n \n **\n I've been saying since forever that chemical changes of any kind can and do happen accidentally/unintentionally, and that systemic changes can and do happen entropically. The simple fact of random genetic mutations has never been an issue with me, not on this bb or any other. I have never ever said that a certain nucleotide alterations could not have occurred by accident. But I have repeatedly said that an adaptive organismic change could not have originated/evolved purely and simply as a determined mechanical result of a random, accidental, genetic mutation. These are two very different issues. Just try and find a statement of mine where my words ever said anything different.This is about the six or seventh time you've noticed that I've agreed with you about random changes in nucleotides, but because I do not go on as you would like, to say that any given change in a given nucleotide, be it intentional or random, must lead to the origin/evolution of a novel, particular, organismic trait adaptation, you refuse to take yes for an answer. \n \n Nor will I accept your assumption that a genetic mutation that confers an organismic benefit today must have originated that ability by accident, simply because that genetic mutation can occur accidentally. You assume that originally a 'mutation' caused the trait, whereas I do not. I affirm that the organism caused the trait, and then recorded it for posterity in genetic code. Before it did that the same random mutation accomplished nothing, or at least, conferred no adaptive benefit, but after the organism 'wrote it out' that way, the ensuing 'random' mutations now had the same effect as the organismic mutation that originally connected its genetic chemistry to the biological trait it had already created for itself, epigenetically.\n \n Now, as I've told you before, our views are irreconcilable, and we are at an impasse, unless and until you can demonstrate unequivocably, by an empirically factual example, that a random nucleotide change can and does lead directly and without organismic control or influence to some novel adaptive trait. And the only way that you can do that is to provide an example of a genetic mutation that occurs without being the result of an organismic, systematic response to any environmental stimulus acting upon the organism or its forebears, present or past. Just a straightforward accidental genetic change that has never conferred any adaptive benefit of any kind to that organism and/or its antecedents, to date.\n \n That is, genetic mutation. i.e., a novel gene, that mechanically and deterministically does create an organismic trait mutation;-- just not an adaptive one to any proximate stimulus. After all, 'random genetic mutations' cannot be expected to 'hold back' on expressing themselves as traits until the need for them arises, can they? Then you have to show that this non-adaptive organismic trait, as generated by this accidental genetic mutation, can and does prove adaptive to a novel, unanticipated environmental stimulus which it will encounter by sheer coincidence, i.e., randomly, [albeit with a little help from the lab tekkies], in its very near future. Then and only then will you have validated the primary assertion, the 'sine qua non', of \"NDT\"; that a random genetic mutations mechanically develop organismic traits that are not adaptive to any environmental stimulus at the time they originate, but which can and do become coincidentally adaptive wrt novel random environmental factors which organisms will randomly encounter in their own futures, or in their future offspring's futures.",

A particular genetic mutation can occur accidentally - therefore the organismic benefit it confers can occur accidentally, in direct contravention of your metaphysic. \n \n \nBefore it did that the same random mutation accomplished nothing, or at least, conferred no adaptive benefit,\n\n \n Very interesting... I expect you have good evidence for this? Or is this arbitrary and never-observed biochemical caveat derived from your metaphysic?\n \n \nNow, as I've told you before, our views are irreconcilable, and we are at an impasse, unless and until you can demonstrate unequivocably, by an empirically factual example, that a random nucleotide change can and does lead directly and without organismic control or influence to some novel adaptive trait.

Just a straightforward accidental genetic change that has never conferred any adaptive benefit of any kind to that organism and/or its antecedents, to date.\n\n \n Ok, I'll bite :)\n \n \nThat is, genetic mutation. i.e., a novel gene, that mechanically and deterministically does create an organismic trait mutation;-- just not an adaptive one to any proximate stimulus. After all, 'random genetic mutations' cannot be expected to 'hold back' on expressing themselves as traits until the need for them arises, can they?\n\n \n Absolutely not. Mutations can occur within genes that were not expressed in the present environment, but there their 'holding back' is systemic and unrelated to the mutation itself.\n \n \nThen you have to show that this non-adaptive organismic trait, as generated by this accidental genetic mutation, can and does prove adaptive to a novel, unanticipated environmental stimulus which it will encounter by sheer coincidence, i.e., randomly, [albeit with a little help from the lab tekkies], in its very near future. \n\n \n No problem. Although why 'very near' future specifically? Helpful in a later environment is helpful in a later environment; the intervening span of time is irrelevant.\n \n \nThen and only then will you have validated the primary assertion, the 'sine qua non', of \"NDT\"; that a random genetic mutations mechanically develop organismic traits that are not adaptive to any environmental stimulus at the time they originate, but which can and do become coincidentally adaptive wrt novel random environmental factors which organisms will randomly encounter in their own futures, or in their future offspring's futures.\n\n \n Just a quick note: RM doesn't have to occur prior to the environmental change, yes? Sure, for the purposes of proving the change wasn't an organismic response, we'll focus here on examples where that's the case, but you do appreciate that being, you know, random and all, mutations can also occur within the environment to which they would be adaptive?\n \n \n OK - before the main event I do want to deal in a bit more detail with this:\n \n \nBefore it did that the same random mutation accomplished nothing, or at least, conferred no adaptive benefit,\n\n \n which is a reformulation of this from earlier in the discussion:\n \n \n2/that the product of that process is immutable, determined, and inevitable, no matter whether the 'mutation' is accidental or systematic,\n\n \n We've talked before about gene splicing, where a genetic change is enforced upon an organism to see what happens, and you've claimed that this doesn't count because the change was intentional - albeit on the part of the lab techs rather than the organism.\n \n However, what you've just said is this:\n \n \nI affirm that the organism caused the trait, and then recorded it for posterity in genetic code.\n\n \n Clearly, this isn't happening in the case of gene splicing; the organism does not possess the trait in any form until after the splice has occurred, and thereafter it always and inevitably does. Strike one for your contention that only endogenous DNA encodings of a pre-existing trait can result in the expression and inheritance of that trait.\n \n Second, what about this intangible 'intent' that you insist is vitally important? Where is it encoded in the material spliced into the organism's DNA? Why can the organism distinguish between 'random' and 'intentional and endogenous' genetic change, yet mysteriously fail to distinguish exogenous and endogenous deliberate change? Strike two.\n \n And yes, there's a fantastic strike three: harmful random mutations. I knew they'd come in handy somewhere :)\n \n Whether accidental (induced by radiation) or deliberately spliced into a cell, such mutations produce the same outcome. The presence or absence of intent is empirically irrelevant.

You haven't even gone so far as to establish any kind of strong statistical correlation between clearly and indisputably 'random' genetic mutations and clearly adaptive traits that you can claim, and try to demonstrate as determined by, those particular genetic mutations. You just wave your hands repeatedly as if there was any solid empirical evidence that genetic mutation A always leads to organismic mutation B, inevitrably and invariably, when in fact you've got no such evidence at all.

I am here making the requirement that any particular genetic mutation that apparently is responsible for an adaptive organismic trait is in fact random, and not an organismic response to a proximate environmental stimulus. I am still insisting that such genetic mutations [please try to read the whole and entire sentence for a change] be proven random, and not simply be assumed to be random. To spell it out for you for the umpteenth time, I do not doubt that genetic mutations occur randomly, i.e., unintentionally, by accident. I do assume, as you apparently do, that all genetyic mutations are random, and that there is no other kind of causation to be associated with genetic mutations aside from random chance. Because I assume, unlike you, that some genetic changes are systematic, [organismically intentional], I demand that you prove that a particular genetic mutation, one that apparently is responsible for the generation of a novel, adaptive organismic trait, is actually random,-- instead of simply assuming that it is, as you do.\n \n This requirement is NOT, as much as much as you would like to spin it that way, a denial by me that random mutations 'happen', and can happen to any gene. They do, and I've never said that they do not.\n \n When you say, \"such mutations\", you insinuate that by saying the above, I am saying that 'random genetic mutations that mechanically determine adaptive organismic traits' can and do 'happen', which is simply untrue, and by now you must be fully aware that it is untrue. The simple empirical reality of random genetic mutations, and the complex theoretical postulate of random genetic mutations that mechanically generate adaptive organismic traits, are not the same issues at all. Why do you keep telling us that they are the same thing, when you must know by now that they are not?!?\n \n I'm getting too peeved with you to continue until after I've had a break.

Ok, you don't think mutation should refer to what it does - I'm sorry if my failure to appreciate that has impeded our communication.\n\n \n \n **\n That's not much of a defence, since a/a change in a chemical sequence, i.e., a nucleotide in a 'gene', that is, a 'genetic mutation' is totally meaningless, has no significance at all, per se. Therefore it cannot be called, 'harmful, beneficial, adaptive, maladaptive, inconsequential, neutral, or anything else, UNLESS you make the false and unfounded assumption that genes and the organismic traits that they encode are the exact same things. IOW, unless you confuse and conflate the 'map' for the 'country'. Therefore saying 'maladaptive mutation' must, logically, apply to the alteration in the organismic trait, not the simple chemical switch at the genetic level.\n \n b/to try to prevent this common darwinist mistake, [of characterizing genetic mutations as adaptive or maladaptive or whatever, on the assumption that the quality of the organismic mutations maps directly to the genetic mutation], I have have taken a lot of trouble distinguishing genetic mutations from organismic mutations, and so my meaning should have been clear as daylight all along.\n \n c/Mutation is a word meaning 'change', from the latin, and has been a part of the english language since the english intelligentsia switched from latin to vernacular english centuries ago. It entered into biology about a century back when, I believe that it was Hugo DeVries, used it to describe how organisms changed over the course of evolution. It then referred to any change in any organismic trait, that is, in any defined part of any organism or in its standard behaviours. Quickly the darwinists arbitrarily assigned the word, Humpty Dumpty-style as is their habitual practice, to one part of the organism only--the genome. For at least 80 years they have been insisting, on no logical, semantic, or scientific basis, but solely to serve their own self-interest, that the word 'mutation' in biology refers solely to genes--meaning that organisms do not, can not, 'mutate', only 'genes', whatever they are, can do that. Moreover, this corrupt semantic distortion not only denotes a genetic change, it connoytes a 'random' genetic change, since in darwin-speak, ALL genetic mutations are held to be random in nature.\n \n All of this is insupportably dishonest, disingenuous, and tendentious. It is not science, but deception. And there are dozens of other example of darwinist semantic dishonesty sp[rinkled liberally throuout their RMNS apologetics.\n \n So if you think that, after 100 years of repeated distortion, wherebye darwinists have connived to force semantic distortions unto the pages of our dictionaries, I am simply going to play along with your semantic con game, you are sadly mistaken.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n I'm getting too peeved with you to continue until after I've had a break. Your chemist-style sophistry is really getting on my nerves. \n \n I would submit that interpreting what you say using the accepted scientific meaning of words hardly counts as 'sophistry'.\n\n \n **\n That is not what is happening, even though that is the excuse you are using.\n \n \n\n Look, I've apologised enough, I think. However belatedly we got here, we've established that genetic changes we empirically associate with helpful traits can and do occur randomly.\n\n \n **\n Not so. You claim that random genetic changes, i.e., nucleotide alterations that can and have been specified and proven to be random wrt causation, have been strongly correlated, statistically, with specified and unequivocally adaptive organismic traits. You talk of this incessently, but you never provide any empirical evidence tgo that effect, and I'm not taking your word for it.\n \n If you wish to convince anyone, especially myself, that the correlation of occurence of a certain gene mutation and a certain organismic mutation maps one to one, where the aforementioned gene mutation is 'random' [because no specified environmental stimulus to which it could be an attributed response exists at present or in its antecedant's past experience], and the aforementioned organismic mutation is unequivocally adaptive/productive in the organism's own terms, then you are going to have to come up with real evidence supporting your claim. Blowing the same old smoke just isn't going to cut it.\n \n \n\n So whatever your metaphysical 'can't happen' speaks to, it's not that.\n\n \n **\n Sys you, but until you establish the empirical reality of your claimed, 'association', and demonstrate just how this 'association' demonstrates anything meaningful, [as above], then the metaphysical objection that adaptive organismic traits cannot be caused by random genetic mutations, as such, still stands firm and unshaken.\n \n \n\n So let's leave that behind us and move on, shall we?\n\n \n **\n You can try, but it's not going to just blow away.\n \n \n \n\n 1. How do reconcile that affirmation with the organism's hypermutational response mechanism, which involves the inhibition of error-correction protocols during replication? Why would that be of any value to the organism if it had already translated and encoded its organismic response into its DNA?\n\n \n **\n What's not to \"reconcile\"?!? Who they heck said that bacteria colony, \"had already translated and encoded its organismic response into its DNA\" before hypermutation?!?!. For heaven's sake, hypermutation _is_ the organismic response, and it takes place, and the 'results' are 'tested', before the colony as a whole incorporates the mutation into its genotype. \n \n I say that organisms dynamically generate adaptive responses and record the successful ones in its genome. [In the case of eusocial bacteria. eg. e.coli., replace 'genome', which applies to individual cells, with 'genotype', which refers to the whole organism/colony as a collective entity.] And that is exactly what an eusocial bacteria colony it doing when heuristically searching for an adaptive response to a novel environmental stimulus, such as an unfamiliar antibiotic.\n You seem to assume, wrongly, that somatic hypermutation means that bacteria cells simply go dormant, hibernate, fall into a coma, or whatever, and lie there passively while their genes are battered randomly by fly-by particles. That is not what's happening. In actuality, the somatic cells are generating novel 'genes' systematically, heuristically, by means of relaxed error correction mechanisms and stimulated, 'hyped-up', replication, amplification, and other cellular dynamics. \n \n Also, as they clone new cells, the bacteria stay in communication with their member-cells, exchanging genetic info and receiving feedback. It's all very dynamic, very systematic. They are not, so to speak, simply laying around on a beach, passively waiting for a random photon to fix them up, and leaving off the sunscreen so it'll happen quicker.\n \n \n \n\n 3. How do you reconcile that affirmation with your earlier explanation of the emergence of resistant bacteria in the absence of any antibiotic stimulus? Specifically, you were presented with an experiment where a pure resistant strain was cultured without any of the bacteria being exposed to antibiotic. Your explanation was that the resistance was one of the things the bacteria 'tried' in a heuristic attempt to respond to some other unknown stimulus, and that its subsequent usefulness vs antibiotic was coincidental.\n\n \n **\n Best stop you here before you muddy the facts entirely. Here is what really happened. At one point you presented a case, an experiment, wherein bacteria were artificially reduced to what is called a 'pure' culture, [meaning that it showed no apparent ability to resist antibiotic \"A\"], and then subsequently developed resistance to antibiotic \"A\", \"randomly\", according to you, but without empirical evidence. As I recall, my objection to this imputed \"spontaneous generation\" was that the culture was seen to develop resistance _after_ exposure, [at some point in the experiment or in its past organismic history], to antibiotic \"A\". \n But that was not the significant part. That came when it turned out that the bacteria that were now resistant to antibiotic \"A\", were also, coincidentally, resistant to anti-biotic \"B\", to which they had had no previous exposure. You then said that this, being coincidental, showed that adaptive effects can arise from random mutations. You ignored me when I pointed out that the mutation, itself was systematic, responsive, and non-random, and that the fact that it had two adaptive effects, one of them coincidental, simply did not fulfill your claim. \n \n \n\n However, here you're saying that the bacteria only 'writes' useful changes into the genome. In that experiment, the resistance was never, ever useful to any of the bacteria in the colony, so why would they hardwire it into their genome?\n\n \n **\n Evidently you are talking of some other experiment with which I am totally unfamiliar!!\n \n Break time.",

Who they heck said that bacteria colony, \"had already translated and encoded its organismic response into its DNA\" before hypermutation?!?!.\n\n \n That much is obvious from the nature of the hypermutation system. By the time the 'response' has any say in the matter, the genetic change is already present in the bacteria's genome. \n \n \nbefore the colony as a whole incorporates the mutation into its genotype. \n\n \n Using that phrase to describe the process of differential reproductive rates - adaptive mutants out-competing their fellows - which actually achieves that population-level genotype change, is stretching things a bit. When all but 0.1% of a colony die due to antibiotic exposure, is it the colony 'incorporating' the resistant mutation into its genotype or is it just that there's nothing else left? When one mutant proliferates and outcompetes all its struggling peers, is that really a eusocial decision, or - gasp - survival of the fittest? :)\n \n \nThey are not, so to speak, simply laying around on a beach, passively waiting for a random photon to fix them up, and leaving off the sunscreen so it'll happen quicker.\n\n \n Funny, then, that battering them with extra random photons induces more mutations, including the helpful ones. And that's true with or without a hypermutational response occurring. :)\n \n \nBest stop you here before you muddy the facts entirely.\n\n \n Allow me to return the favour. Here is what really happened.\n \n The bacteria cloned to start the experiment was not resistant. The final colony, consisting of bacteria never exposed at any time during the experiment to the antibiotic, were all genetically resistant. No stimulus, no hypermutational response. Your knee-jerk reaction was that they 'must have been' trying out responses to some other toxin, despite no such toxin being present. They were doing no such thing.\n \n Upon re-reading, one paragraph from your earlier post did intrigue me greatly:\n \n \nI affirm that the organism caused the trait, and then recorded it for posterity in genetic code. Before it did that the same random mutation accomplished nothing, or at least, conferred no adaptive benefit, but after the organism 'wrote it out' that way, the ensuing 'random' mutations now had the same effect as the organismic mutation that originally connected its genetic chemistry to the biological trait it had already created for itself, epigenetically.\n\n \n If I'm reading this correctly, you're describing something akin to the organism creating a genetic 'switch' regulating a biological trait, such that future random mutation at that locus could accidentally reactivate that same trait.\n \n Therefore random mutation can, in your opinion, cause a trait to be accidentally re-expressed (and be coincidentally helpful if an apt environmental change occurs therafter), it just can't generate the trait in the first place? Is that correct?\n \n So your interpretation of the above experiment would be that the resistance was being re-expressed at random (since there was certainly no stimulus) but that the bacteria must in their ancestral past have been exposed to that antibiotic and at that time configured themselves such that the presence of a particular allele would cause the resistance to re-emerge.\n \n Do I have that more or less right?",

Who they heck said that bacteria colony, \"had already translated and encoded its organismic response into its DNA\" before hypermutation?!?!. \n \n \n That much is obvious from the nature of the hypermutation system. By the time the 'response' has any say in the matter, the genetic change is already present in the bacteria's genome. \n\n \n **\n The \"response\" is a single cell, a mutated clone developed during the 'stationary-phase' of a colony's repopulation, by cellular hypermutation. Not being a micro-biologist I have only the basic information. As I see it, the the colony entire is the 'organism' and stationary-phase hypermutation is a systematic, systemic [colony/organism wide] adaptation mechanism. No doubt you will prefer to promote the view that each bacterial cell is its own organism, but I find that view to be outdated by the modern understanding of eusocial bacterial dynamics. \n \n Given that the colony, not the individual cell, constitutes the 'lifeform', the 'biosystem' as such, and considering hypermutation as a system-wide, systematic heuristic search for an adaptive organismic response to a proximate environmental stimulus [eg. an antibiotic, phage], then what is spoken of the 'genome' in multi-celled sexually reproducing organisms, is more properly the over-all 'genotype' of the colony entire. \n The point here is that considering the colony and its adaptive evolution in terms of alteration of its collected genotype shows that each individual mutant clone cell is a 'response', via hypermutation, to the external stimulus. Though different from it, this mechanism is comparable to the adaptation mechanism of more complex sexually reproducing organisms that require an epigenetic organismic mutation prior to the genomic mutation, in that the colony overall requires only one successful mutant cell before it alters its entire genotype. \n \n This is the second time in two posts that I've tried to explain my point to you.\n I hope you get it because I'm not going over it again.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n before the colony as a whole incorporates the mutation into its genotype. \n \n \n Using that phrase to describe the process of differential reproductive rates - adaptive mutants out-competing their fellows - which actually achieves that population-level genotype change, is stretching things a bit.\n\n \n **\n That was not my intention, but if you have to interpret my words in darwinist terms, then prepare to lose something in translation.\n \n \n\n When all but 0.1% of a colony die due to antibiotic exposure, is it the colony 'incorporating' the resistant mutation into its genotype or is it just that there's nothing else left?\n\n \n **\n A mutant cell does not go on to regenerate a new colonial genotype unless it survives, and it does not survive unless it has developed, via the colony's hypermutation adaptation mechanism, the adaptive cellular trait that the colony needed to begin with.\n \n \n\n When one mutant proliferates and outcompetes all its struggling peers, is that really a eusocial decision, or - gasp - survival of the fittest? \n\n \n **\n Now you are talking what is, to my ears, mere darwinist gibberish.\n \n Break time.",

   "\n To which my responses are thus:\n \n 1. How do reconcile that affirmation with the organism's hypermutational response mechanism, which involves the inhibition of error-correction protocols during replication? Why would that be of any value to the organism if it had already translated and encoded its organismic response into its DNA?\n\n \n **\n Answered in earlier post.\n \n \n\n 2. How do you reconcile that affirmation with situations where the mutation itself is an absolute prerequisite, where synthesis of a protein or processing of a nutrient are chemically impossible without a particular allele?\n\n \n **\n As above.\n \n \n\n 3. How do you reconcile that affirmation with your earlier explanation of the emergence of resistant bacteria in the absence of any antibiotic stimulus? Specifically, you were presented with an experiment where a pure resistant strain was cultured without any of the bacteria being exposed to antibiotic. Your explanation was that the resistance was one of the things the bacteria 'tried' in a heuristic attempt to respond to some other unknown stimulus, and that its subsequent usefulness vs antibiotic was coincidental.\n\n \n **\n If I remember this instance correctly, the original artificially culture bacter colony was directly exposed to some kind of artificially induced environmental/experimental stimulus, I believe UV radiation, to which it developed an adaptive response. Later it was found that that systematically, heuristically, non-randomly generated affect was also effectively adaptive wrt a different environmental stimulus, possibly a phage or other anti-biotic, I can't remember what, exactly. But the does not matter. Once a trait is teleologically originated, what does it matter how many other 'effects', related or distinct from that for which it was originally 'designed', it is subsequently and coincidentally effective? A hammer is designed and manufactured for driving nails, but since it is also effective as a murder weapon, or for cracking nuts, is that such a big deal that you find it scientifically significant?\n \n \n\n However, here you're saying that the bacteria only 'writes' useful changes into the genome. In that experiment, the resistance was never, ever useful to any of the bacteria in the colony, so why would they hardwire it into their genome?\n\n \n **\n Once again I fail to follow you. If the genetic mutation, per se, resulted in a positive adaptation to UV radiation, then that, in and of itself alone' would be enough to get it 'hard-wired' into the genotype. The fact that the genetic mutation also provided an apparently coincidental phenotypic, 'resistance to toxin', trait, is irrelevent to its conservation in the absence of that antibiotic, just as it was coincidental to the existence of that antibiotic in the first place.\n \n You are repeatedly trying to demonstrate that an adaptive biological trait can arise, originate, evolve, by unintentional, random causation. To do that, in this attempt at least, you try to argue that, since an adaptive biological effect, ie., bacteria resistance, coincidentally arises thanks to a genetic effect [mutation] that occurs during artificial over-exposure to UV radiation, that this 'coincidental to cause' adaptation is a random effect stemming from a random cause.\n A random, i.e., coincidental' effect it may well be, [I do not know the actual chemistry involved, but no matter]. But the effects are not the issue. The _cause_ is the issue, and unless and until you can show that the novel mutated gene that conferred a cellular 'resistance' to accidental genetic mutation by UV radiation, arose from a random genetic accident mechanically caused by UV radiation, you cannot prove that you are correct to call this a case of 'random causation'. \n \n You assume that the genetic mutation was the strictly mechanical, albeit statistically stochastic, result of a 'random' genetic 'accident' caused by 'random' bit of ultra-violet radiation striking just the right gene in such a particular way that the genotype suddenly aquired a new 'gene' that determined a novel adaptive trait, i.e., resistance to cellular mutations induced by radiation, by pure fortuitous accident. Just plain luck, IOW. Even luckier still, this fortuitous genetic change had second lucky effect, it also coincidentally conferred antibiotic resistance. \n \n But since when is 'luck' a scientific mechanism? Since when is 'chance' a scientific mechanism? Since when is 'random causation' a scientific mechanism? Since when is 'spontaneous generation' a scientific mechanism?\n But that is what you _assume_ here, when you see a 'gene' appear that leads to an adaptive response contra damaging cellular mutations. That is, a supposedly accidental but 'adaptive' genetic mutation generated, you assume, by that very same destructive radiation whose accidental effects it now counteracts!\n \n Sorry, but you are really treading water when you claim that the twice adaptive cellular mutation arose from a genetic mutation that was just a lucky accident.\n \n \n\n 4. Clearly, what you describe isn't happening in the case of gene splicing; the organism does not possess the trait in any form until after the splice has occurred, and thereafter it always and inevitably does, regardless of the environment in which the organism is living. Gene splicing proves that genetic change can and does precede and induce traits.\n\n \n **\n \n Gene-splicing--\n \"A term used to refer to the process by which the DNA of an organism is cut and a gene, perhaps from another organism, is inserted. (See genetic engineering and recombinant DNA.) Gene splicing is often used in industry to allow single-celled organisms to produce useful products, such as human insulin. \" answers.com\n \n See a lot of this happening thanks to random causation, do you? And out in the natural world, at that? You're getting as good as ol' chemist, at dredging up red herrings, that is. \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Before it did that the same random mutation accomplished nothing, or at least, conferred no adaptive benefit, \n \n \n which echoes the sentiment of your earlier words:\n \n \n Quote:\n 2/that the product of that process is immutable, determined, and inevitable, no matter whether the 'mutation' is accidental or systematic, \n \n \n My responses to this are:\n \n 1. Why can the organism distinguish between 'random' and 'intentional and endogenous' genetic change, yet mysteriously fail to distinguish exogenous (ie gene splicing) and endogenous deliberate change?\n\n \n **\n First of all, this is not a response, it's a question, and is rhetorical insofaras you think you already know the answer. My short answer/response to this question is, because it is intelligent; meaning that unlike passive 'bits of stuff' and mechanical systems, live organisms can identify, evaluate, and choose.\n And that's the nub of the philosophical difference that separates our contrary views wrt evolution.\n \n \n\n This despite the former being carried out via purely mechanistic chemical intermediaries.\n\n \n **\n The most egregious error in the darwinist understanding of Lamarck, and its most corrupt criticism of Lamarckism, is that it applies its own mechanist understanding of causation to lamarckian evolution, just as much as it does to its own. That is, it assumes, a priori, that all biological causation is exogenous, and that organisms are as endogenously dynamic as a rock or or a drop of water. That they have to have things 'done to them', instead of being able to do for themselves.\n \n That is why darwinists have always misinterpreted lamarck, saying that lamarck claimed that giraffe's have long necks because they sretched them, physically, again and again, reaching for leaves that that were higher and higher up the tree. Even Lamarck, 200 years ago, said absolutely no such thing. What he did say was that the giraffe organism, recognising that 'bigger was better', especially in terms of predators, did what a lot of organisms do--it got as big as available forage allowed it to get, through developmental evolution and epigenetic changes in behaviour and morphology, which in turn led to other changes in behaviour and morphology.\n \n Now, 'getting big' has its advantages, such as being less prone to carnivore predation, with side benefits like being able to eat leaves that other animals can't reach, but it also has its drawbacks, Getting 'big' often means 'getting tall', and long legs require proportional adjustments across the morphological board. For example, one drawback of long legs is that without a long neck, or a long nose/trunk, or a long beak, it's very difficult to get a drink of water without kneeling down, which cancels out the predator advantage that being tall gave you in the first place. So giraffes, camels, etc., developed, dynamically, internally, endogenously, adaptively long appendages to suit their own internally induced 'tallness'. Now they can drink by merely spreading their lags, instead of having to kneel down. A very efficient design modification that weas internally generated by the organism's need to survive, thrive, and possibly reproduce, and not by any physical, mechanical 'stretching' activity, as the darwinists falsely pretend.\n \n Sorry for going off into my 'giraffe' rant, but it is pertinent. The fact is that neither Lamarck himself, nor any of his followers since, has ever claimed that organisms have any control over exogenously arriving mechanistic alterations to them, morphologically or behaviourally. That is, no Lamarckian ever claimed that if you cut an organism such that it left a healing scar, then the organism would pass on the scar to its offspring. Or, as that circumcised neo-darwinian, Weismann, preposterously claimed, that if you [exogenously, of course] cut off a mouse's tail, that lamarckism requires that that tail-less mouse produce tail-less pups.\n \n Your question, above, falls under the same absurd mental construction.\n \n \n\n 2. Whether accidental (induced by radiation) or deliberately spliced into a cell, harmful genetic changes produce the same outcome. The presence or absence of intent is empirically irrelevant.\n\n \n **\n To \"harmful genetic changes\", perhaps, if you can suppose that organisms would have sufficient reason to want to deliberately harm themselves genetically. Otherwise, I would suppose that all harmful genetic mutations occur contrary to the organism's wishes. The presence of DNA repair mechanisms seems to indicate this, if you ask me.\n \n \n\n Which leaves you in the rather awkward position of having to explain why an organism would volitionally not express and exploit an accidentally occurring helpful genetic change,\n\n \n **\n How can you claim that an adaptation is helpful unless it is, immediately, helpful in a certain situation? And if that is the case, and it is adaptive to a proximate environmental factor, what grounds do you have for assuming that it's all just a lucky coincidence?\n \n You keep on assuming that all genetic mutations are accidental, that each and all genetic mutations deterministically and mechanically and uncontrollably lead to certain, particular, organismic 'traits', and that all organismic traits are only coincidentally, as a matter of pure chance, correlated negatively or positively to the randomly generated environmental factors that impact the organism's ability to survive, therive, and possibly reproduce. All of these assumptions are entirely unfounded in empirical, i.e., scientific terms.\n \n \n\n yet will always choose to express and suffer the consequences of an accidental harmful one. \n\n \n **\n Not the actual case at all. Look up \"The SOS Response\", and bacteriological DNA repair mechanisms.\n \n \n\n Surely if, as you claim, it can distinguish and decide not to express a random genetic change that coincidentally looks like an encoding of a helpful trait, it ought to have no trouble ignoring a randomly occurring harmful mutation.\n\n \n **\n You are looking at everything backwards. First, the organism does not know whether or not any genetic mutation that it has not itself generated as a response to given externally arriving stimulus will prove advantageous, or else destructive, once expressed. That is why, whenever possible, it repairs such mutations as best it can, without waiting 'to see what happens'. Second, as far as bacteria are concerned, they being one of the few lifeforms that directly dabble in genetic mutation, they often, perhaps always, do not 'know' if the mutants they generate systematically will prove out to be adaptive or maladaptive, but since, for their lifeform, all but one cell/mutant is expendable and they'll still have successfully adapted themselves, they can afford to take chances and bet longshots that the rest of us can't.",

Your analogy fails miserably since you have two tools instead of one (provided that the antibiotic resistant cells are indeed resistant to UV which is not tested in the experiment). Your argument is like equivalencing adaptation to breathing air to adaptation for living on the ocean bottom.\n \n \n \nOnce again I fail to follow you. If the genetic mutation, per se, resulted in a positive adaptation to UV radiation, then that, in and of itself alone' would be enough to get it 'hard-wired' into the genotype. \n\n \n So what? Why do you think a mutation adaptive to UV radiation would have anything at all to do with the experiment. The experimenters certainly did not test or examine the colonies for such mutants! Indeed you do not even know that any such adaptation occurred at all!\n \n \nThe fact that the genetic mutation also prvided an apparently coincidental phenotypic, 'resistance to toxin', trait, is irrelevent to its conservation in the absence of that antibiotic, just as it was coincidental to the existence of that antibiotic in the first place.\n\n \n If the mutation to UV adaptation actually occurred (and you have zip evidence for that) then the two phenotypes (UV adapted, antibiotic resistant) are most likely NOT coincident but rather independent. But all you know is that mutants arose which were resistant to antibiotic (or phage). The UV adaptation would be a quite different mechanism and involve different gene products than would antibiotic resistance.\n \n \nYou are repeatedly trying to demonstrate that an adaptive biological trait can arise, originate, evolve, by unintentional, random causation. To do that, in this attempt at least, you try to argue that, since an adaptive biological effect, ie., bacteria resistance, coincidentally arises thanks to a genetic effect [mutation] that occurs during artificial over-exposure to UV radiation, that this 'coincidental to cause' adaptation is a random effect stemming from a random cause.\n\n \n Indeed the antibiotic resistance (phage resistance) is independent in mechanism from UV adaptation (which is not known to have occurred in the experiment at all). Since the two are independent then one has to invoke a separate mutation for the antibiotic resistance etc.\n \n \n A random, i.e., coincidental' effect it may well be, [I do not know the actual chemistry involved, but no matter]. But the effects are not the issue. The _cause_ is the issue, and unless and until you can show that the novel mutated gene that conferred a cellular 'resistance' to accidental genetic mutation by UV radiation, arose from a random genetic accident mechanically caused by UV radiation, you cannot prove that you are correct to call this a case of 'random causation'. \n\n \n Its an independent effect. Whether its truly random is quite beside the point as long as the two effects do not arise from the same mutations then you have not a leg to stand on. Whether they are truly random has no meaning if they are independent and uncorrelated mechanistically. Plus of course you still have no evidence than ANY adaptation to UV occurred.\n \n \nYou assume that the genetic mutation was the strictly mechanical, albeit statistically stochastic, result of a 'random' genetic 'accident' caused by 'random' bit of ultra-violet radiation striking just the right gene in such a particular way that the genotype suddenly aquired a new 'gene' that determined a novel adaptive trait, i.e., resistance to cellular mutations induced by radiation, by pure fortuitous accident. Just plain luck, IOW. Even luckier still, this fortuitous genetic change had second lucky effect, it also coincidentally conferred antibiotic resistance. \n\n \n Yep thats why one only gets a few cells per million or billion which mutated to antibiotic or phage resistance. Its a very chancy effect and most cells do not end up with the relevant mutation. Just plain luck it is indeed. And the fact that the UV has to chemically alter just the right nucleotide out of billions of them is why so few cells in a colony are mutated to antibiotic or phage resistance by low level controlled UV exposure. And once again FYI the two mutations are indpendent and given the low rates the chances of any given cell having both would be at most 1 in 10^12 or so. And I once again remind you that you have no evidence that any adaptation to UV took place at all. Thats an unwarranted assumption on your part.\n \n \nBut since when is 'luck' a scientific mechanism? Since when is 'chance' a scientific mechanism? Since when is 'random causation' a scientific mechanism? Since when is 'spontaneous generation' a scientific mechanism?\n But that is what you _assume_ here, when you see a 'gene' appear that leads to an adaptive response contra damaging cellular mutations. That is, a supposedly accidental but 'adaptive' genetic mutation generated, you assume, by that very same destructive radiation whose accidental effects it now counteracts!\n\n \n Luck (meaning probalistic processes) has long been a critical part of science. For example how else would you compute the odds of rolling a 6 on a pair of dice. Luck (in the form of statistically independent assortment of genes) was of course a key part of Mendels original studies. Luck (ie probability of collisions taking place in a certain way) plays a key role in organic chemistry. Luck(meaning neutron cross sections - probability of a collison of a neutron with a nucleus) plays a large role in building atomic bombs. In fact Heisenberg may have sabotaged the NAZI bomb program by deliberately getting that little piece of physics wrong. Speaking of real LUCK! And yet again you have assumed that (undocumented) UV adaptation would necessarily be due to the same mutation as antibiotic resistance - something you cannot support with data or have at least NOT supported with data.\n \n \n \n \nSorry, but you are really treading water when you claim that the twice adaptive cellular mutation arose from a genetic mutation that was just a lucky accident\n \n\n \n And you are going down for the third time by claiming that any of the results observed did in fact involve a mutation which both provided UV adaptation and antibiotic resistance. Can you produce any studies which showed that two such traits were observed at all , let alone were due to the same alteration of a nucleotide????? Don't think you can back that claim up with experimental findings - but please do so if you can.\n \n \nGene-splicing--\n \"A term used to refer to the process by which the DNA of an organism is cut and a gene, perhaps from another organism, is inserted. (See genetic engineering and recombinant DNA.) Gene splicing is often used in industry to allow single-celled organisms to produce useful products, such as human insulin. \" answers.com\n\n \n Among other things including transformation of animal and plant cells to produce specific proteins or metabolites.\n \n \nSee a lot of this happening thanks to random causation, do you? And out in the natural world, at that? You're getting as good as ol' chemist, at dredging up red herrings, that is. \n \n\n \n Actually gene splicing is well known to occur naturally. See my earlier references to A.C. Braun's work and subsequent elucidation of the mechanisms. Horizontal gene transfer is common among bacteria in nature, and of course there is that recent report of nearly the entire genome of a parasite being incorporated in insects which it infests. Thats due to gene splicing. In addition its well known that an number of viral genes have been spliced into the human genome although many have been renedered inactive by epigenetic mechanisms. \n \n 1. Why can the organism distinguish between 'random' and 'intentional and endogenous' genetic change, yet mysteriously fail to distinguish exogenous (ie gene splicing) and endogenous deliberate change?\n \n \n \nFirst of all, this is not a response, it's a question, and is rhetorical insofaras you think you already know the answer. My short answer/response to this question is, because it is intelligent; meaning that unlike passive 'bits of stuff' and mechanical systems, live organisms can identify, evaluate, and choose.\n And that's the nub of the philosophical difference that separates our contrary views wrt evolution.\n\n \n OK if a bacterium is intelligent feel free to prove it. And then prove that such intelligence (if any) is applied to the problem at hand. Then please explain why an intelligent organism would splice in genes which will give it a disease very similar to cancer in animals (ie crown gall) and why almost all dicots are subject to this same disease, after all they cannot all be stupid can they? Then you can explain why known to be intelligent organisms like humans would opt to do the same with regard to incorporating the herpes viruses into their nerve cell genomes. And then explain why chickens would incorporate genes from the Rous Sacroma virus into their cells resulting in cancer? Any answers to all these natural effects? None of that seems very intelligent to me - YOU?\n \n \nThe most egregious error in the darwinist understanding of Lamarck, and its most corrupt criticism of Lamarckism, is that it applies its own mechanist understanding of causation to lamarckian evolution, just as much as it does to its own. That is, it assumes, a priori, that all biological causation is exogenous, and that organisms are as endogenously dynamic as a rock or or a drop of water. That they have to have things 'done to them', instead of being able to do for themselves.\n\n \n Well thats simply wrong. We are as biologists well aware that many mutations arise from endogenous cellular mechanisms. Among these are free radicals produced by metabolic processes, copy errors during transcription, copy errors during translation, and errors in post translational processing of gene products. Indeed these endogenous mechanisms have led to the evolution of whole endogenous systems to repair and correct such errors - but they are not perfect and some errors slip through. Mammals for example end up producing far fewer such errors per gene product than do say the aids virus which has a really horrible error rate (see WIKI on reverse transcriptase and H. Temin). To sum up your claim is without a factual basis.\n \n \nThat is why darwinists have always misinterpreted lamarck, saying that lamarck claimed that giraffe's have long necks because they sretched them, physically, again and again, reaching for leaves that that were higher and higher up the tree. \n\n \n Lamarck unlike yourself did not invoke will and intelligence in his theory. He defined two \"forces\" the force of complexification and the force of adaptation. Such forces have never been demonstrated.\n \n \nEven Lamarck, 200 years ago, said absolutely no such thing. What he did say was that the giraffe organism, recognising that 'bigger was better', especially in terms of predators, did what a lot of organisms do--it got as big as available forage allowed it to get, through developmental evolution and epigenetic changes in behaviour and morphology, which in turn led to other changes in behaviour and morphology.\n\n \n Actually Lamarck invoked use/disuse and inheritance of the effects of phenotypic plasticity by future generations. He did not in fact seem to claim that any intention or intelligence was involved. I suggest you review what Lamarck did in fact propose. Lamarck did not know enough genetics to postulate what you claim. He knew nothing of epigenetics - or genetics for that matter. What he was postulating was so called \"soft inheritance\" Consider what WIKI has to say:\n \n \nLamarckism or Lamarckian evolution refers to the once widely accepted idea that an organism can pass on characteristics that it acquired during its lifetime to its offspring (also known as based on heritability of acquired characteristics or \"soft inheritance\"). It is named for the French biologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who incorporated the action of soft inheritance into his evolutionary theories and is often incorrectly cited as the founder of soft inheritance.\n \n It proposed that individual efforts during the lifetime of the organisms were the main mechanism driving species to adaptation, as they supposedly would acquire adaptive changes and pass them on to offspring. After publication of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection, the importance of individual efforts in the generation of adaptation was considerably diminished. Later, Mendelian genetics supplanted the notion of inheritance of acquired traits, eventually leading to the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis, and the general abandonment of the Lamarckian theory of evolution in biology. In a wider context, soft inheritance is of use when examining the evolution of cultures and ideas, and is related to the theory of Memetics.\n \n While enormously popular during the early 19th century as an explanation for the complexity observed in living systems, the relevance of soft inheritance within the scientific community dwindled following the theories of August Weismann and the formation of the modern evolutionary synthesis.\n \n\n \n \nNow, 'getting big' has its advantages, such as being less prone to carnivore predation, with side benefits like being able to eat leaves that other animals can't reach, but it also has its drawbacks, Getting 'big' often means 'getting tall', and long legs require proportional adjustments across the morphological board. For example, one drawback of long legs is that without a long neck, or a long nose/trunk, or a long beak, it's very difficult to get a drink of water without kneeling down, which cancels out the predator advantage that being tall gave you in the first place. So giraffes, camels, etc., developed, dynamically, internally, endogenously, adaptively long appendages to suit their own internally induced 'tallness'. Now they can drink by merely spreading their lags, instead of having to kneel down. A very efficient design modification that weas internally generated by the organism's need to survive, thrive, and possibly reproduce, and not by any physical, mechanical 'stretching' activity, as the darwinists falsely pretend.\n\n \n Giving examples of adaptation in no way supports your claims of HOW those adapatations came about. We all agree that life on earth exhibits many adaptations. The issue at hand is evidence and theory with regard to how they arose. You say be intelligent alterations followed by recording in the genes. Science says by natural selection of normal heritable variants within populations over long periods of time and mutiple generations.\n \n \nSorry for going off into my 'giraffe' rant, but it is pertinent. The fact is that neither Lamarck himself, nor any of his followers since, has ever claimed that organisms have any control over exogenously arriving mechanistic alterations to them, morphologically or behaviourally. That is, no Lamarckian ever claimed that if you cut an organism such that it left a healing scar, then the organism would pass on the scar to its offspring. Or, as that circumcised neo-darwinian, Weismann, preposterously claimed, that if you [exogenously, of course] cut off a mouse's tail, that lamarckism requires that that tail-less mouse produce tail-less pups.\n\n \n The problem with Lamarkism is that even non-intelligent species must be able to adapt to survive and give rise to other species. Since intelligence (and will and so forth) are products of brains, then it would be impossible for organisms lacking intelligence to evolve under your assumptions. It simply will not fly (nor could it evolve so as to fly).\n \n \nYour question, above, falls under the same absurd mental construction.\n\n \n His question only fails under the assumption that your insane assumptions are valid. There is much evidence to the contrary.\n \n \nTo \"harmful genetic changes\", perhaps, if you can suppose that organisms would have sufficient reason to want to deliberately harm themselves genetically. Otherwise, I would suppose that all harmful genetic mutations occur contrary to the organism's wishes. The presence of DNA repair mechanisms seems to indicate this, if you ask me. \n\n \n Well you are partially correct. Indeed ALL genetic changes occur in spite of any intelligence the organism possesses. The DNA repair mechanisms indicate that.\n \n \nHow can you claim that an adaptation is helpful unless it is, immediately, helpful in a certain situation? And if that is the case, and it is adaptive to a proximate environmental factor, what grounds do you have for assuming that it's all just a lucky coincidence?\n \n\n \n He did not make such a claim. The mutation of the genetic material can exist independently of a \"need\" for that adaptation. The statistics of both harmful and beneficial mutations follow random statistics this is especially apparent when one follows two mutations at the same time. And of course a mutation which is harmful in one context may be beneficial in another. Thats the case for sickle cell trait for example. Resistance to antibiotic may be beneficial if the antibiotic is present, but costly when it is absent.\n \n \n \nYou keep on assuming that all genetic mutations are accidental, that each and all genetic mutations deterministically and mechanically and uncontrollably lead to certain, particular, organismic 'traits', and that all organismic traits are only coincidentally, as a matter of pure chance, correlated negatively or positively to the randomly generated environmental factors that impact the organism's ability to survive, therive, and possibly reproduce. All of these assumptions are entirely unfounded in empirical, i.e., scientific terms.\n \n\n \n Actually in many cases the assumption of independent segregation are well founded, in others (where a trait is polygeneic, or physically linked not so). And as the environment changes the benefits and disadvantages of a specific gene or genome changes. Its context dependent. All of the assumptions which are actually made (which differ from what you are imagining as straw men) are founded on strong empirical bases.\n \n \n2. Whether accidental (induced by radiation) or deliberately spliced into a cell, harmful genetic changes produce the same outcome. The presence or absence of intent is empirically irrelevant.\n\n **\n \nNot the actual case at all. Look up \"The SOS Response\", and bacteriological DNA repair mechanisms.\n\n \n Repair mechanisms do not enter into it. Most mutations at the DNA level will be copied rather faithfully else no change in trait will be observed. Intent remains irrelevant. Especially seeing as most organisms are not capable of forming \"intent\" at all.\n \n \n \nYou are looking at everything backwards. First, the organism does not know whether or not any genetic mutation that it has not itself generated as a response to given externally arriving stimulus will prove advantageous, or else destructive, once expressed. \n\n \n Indeed organisms in general have no knowledge of their genes at all. And they need not have that knowledge since variation is not intentional and natural selection is ...... selective! And this is precisely why invoking intelligence as a cause of mutations at the level of DNA is totally absurd from the get go.\n \n \nThat is why, whenever possible, it repairs such mutations as best it can, without waiting 'to see what happens'. Second, as far as bacteria are concerned, they being one of the few lifeforms that directly dabble in genetic mutation, they often, perhaps always, do not 'know' if the mutants they generate systematically will prove out to be adaptive or maladaptive, but since, for their lifeform, all but one cell/mutant is expendable and they'll still have successfully adapted themselves, they can afford to take chances and bet longshots that the rest of us can't.\n\n \n However they will not KNOW that they have adapted to new conditions and thus they do not make such adaptations via intelligence or intent! Its all just physics and chemistry playing out in variability combined with selection. Works like a charm given time and enough dead organisms along the way.",

   "I do not know what your, \"existing 'pending' gene-<trait pathway\" is, so I can't answer your question.\n\n \n It's not mine, it's yours.

Hence a gene-trait pathway. So can you answer the question now?\n \n \nIf I remember this instance correctly,\n\n \n Clearly you can't, despite it being directly linked for your convenience.\n \n The experiment to which I refer took a single, non-resistant bacteria and cultured from it a colony. A piece of velveteen was then used to transfer a 'print' of the colony (around 30% of the bacteria, evenly sampled across the plate) to another plate spread with antibiotic. Resistant colonies grew on that second plate. Using their locations, samples from the original plate were scraped and used to culture a second colony, which was then respread, a new print taken and tested for resistance.

Yet the organism plays along. It seems unable to distinguish between an exogenously induced genetic change and one it 'put together' itself. Yet according to you it can and does distinguish between a mutation exogenously induced by a lab tech (the expected trait ensues) and one induced by a stray photon or chemical toxin (according to you, nothing will happen). How is this explicable?\n \n \nHow can you claim that an adaptation is helpful unless it is, immediately, helpful in a certain situation? And if that is the case, and it is adaptive to a proximate environmental factor, what grounds do you have for assuming that it's all just a lucky coincidence?\n\n \n You aren't answering the question again - you're being terribly evasive tonight. We've already agreed random mutations do occur at 'helpful' loci. Yet you insist nothing will happen because it's not 'intentional'. So can you explain why, when in the case of random harmful mutations we know for a fact the exact same thing happens be they intentional or accidental?\n \n It's not about 'assuming' that a particular mutation was randomly induced.

That is, we were doing that, until you switched lanes, to claim that an organismic trait that originated at \"A\", and was recorded by \"A\" in its genome, was, when artificially transferred by\n bioengeneers into organism \"B\" by 'splicing', had the effect on \"B\" that it had where it naturally orginated, back at \"A\". This scenario has no relation to what I spoke of, which is the origin of a trait, not the transfer of a trait, and so your objection , 'gene-splicing', is an irrelevent redherring in that context.\n \n As a matter of interest, Lateral Gene Transfer, which is another cellular mechanism in bacteria and other organisms, is the natural equivalent of 'gene-splicing', and it does not contradict what I said about the origin of traits and what you call 'gene-trait pathways', either.\n \n \n\n So the fact the exact same trait arises in the target organism proves that the gene encapsulates all the necessary new information to give rise to the trait. Gene splicing, in short, proves you wrong.\n\n \n **\n As above, your reasoning is wonky. In the case of origins, of which I was speaking, \"gene-trait pathways\" have to be established by the organism; that is, in the case of adaptive traits, a new gene is _not_ generated spontaneously that then determines the expressed organismic trait directly, unaffected by anything but itself, by creating a linear, chemical pathway all by itself that results inevitably in a particular adaptive organismic trait. That is just your metaphysical supposition.\n \n My supposition is that in the case of the _origin_ of _adaptive_ traits, information about the stimulus is transmitted by the organism to its genome, and the organism establishes an adaptive trait response, a gene that codes for it, and a chemical-information 'pathway' that links the two.\n \n Endowing bacteria cell \"A\" with established gene code \"B\" originated elswhere is simply moving what's done here, to there. Sort of like inheritance. But as always, you just cannot see that inheritance, LGT, and gene-splicing, are NOT the origination of adaptive traits, but only the geographical extension of them, from one organism to another.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n First of all, this is not a response, it's a question, and is rhetorical insofaras you think you already know the answer.

That's why they have the SOS response and DNA repair mechanisms.

Just what organisms can do about gene-splicing I do not know, although I have heard that these GMO's also have revertant tendencies over generations.

If that's, 'playing along', then I guess that you could say that Palestinians are 'playing along' with the Israelis, and Iraqis are 'playing along' with the yanks, and on and on.\n \n \n\n It seems unable to distinguish between an exogenously induced genetic change and one it 'put together' itself. \n\n \n **\n Whether or not it can \"distinguish\" them apart is irrelevent. What matters is what action they can take wrt them. We have to consider whether or not the 'genetic change' is 1/ a random genetic mutation that damages the former gene and that now leads to a novel [maladaptive or inconsequential] trait, or 2/ an organismically induced genetic mutation that records the developmental pathway to an adaptive trait, or 3/ an organismically induced genetic mutation that records the developmental pathway to an adaptive trait in organism that originated in \"A\", and is now forcibly transplanted in organism \"B\". In the case of \"1/\", they can try to do something about it, in the case of \"2/\", they have no reason to do anything about it, and in case \"3/\", they can't do anything about it. At least not immediately. Maybe over generations, but that remains to be seen.\n \n \n\n Yet according to you it can and does distinguish between a mutation exogenously induced by a lab tech (the expected trait ensues) and one induced by a stray photon or chemical toxin (according to you, nothing will happen). How is this explicable?\n\n \n **\n You are once again distorting what I say. As for the explanation of what I actually said, see above.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n How can you claim that an adaptation is helpful unless it is, immediately, helpful in a certain situation? And if that is the case, and it is adaptive to a proximate environmental factor, what grounds do you have for assuming that it's all just a lucky coincidence? \n \n \n You aren't answering the question again - you're being terribly evasive tonight. We've already agreed random mutations do occur at 'helpful' loci. \n\n \n **\n No we have not. We have established that random genetic mutations can happen at any locus. We have not established that certain genetic loci are, per se or in se, 'helpful' , i.e., the determining source, by their very chemical nature, of adaptive organismic traits. Therefore there is no causal link between random mutations at a genetic locus and any beneficial organismic mutations that may be recorded at that locus.\n \n As for what you interpret as evasiveness, what you are seeing is the difficulty that arises when red herrings are injected into arguments, and must be disposed of.\n \n \n\n Yet you insist nothing will happen because it's not 'intentional'. So can you explain why, when in the case of random harmful mutations we know for a fact the exact same thing happens be they intentional or accidental?\n\n \n **\n No idea by what you mean by \"the same thing happens\", but I do know that cells do try to repair DNA, but that that doesn't mean that they always succeed. Mutants happen.\n \n \n\n It's not about 'assuming' that a particular mutation was randomly induced. It's about knowing, as we both do, that such mutations do occur, and evaluating what happens afterwards.\n\n \n **\n What do you mean by \"such mutations\"?! We both know that random genetic mutations occur, and that they sometimes result in maladaptive, even deadly, organismic mutations. That is not what all this is about. What this is actually all about is your metaphysical contention that random genetic mutations can and do generate adaptive organismic mutations, but only by happy coincidence.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n \"You keep on assuming that all genetic mutations are accidental,\"\n \n You keep saying that, and it keeps on not being true. I'm just accepting, as you have, that random genetic mutations do happen, and they happen at the sites we're interested in.\n\n \n **\n You are the only one \"interested\" in the \"sites\" for their own sakes. I don't think they matter unless and until they are linked to an organismic trait, one way or another. Up to that point, your 'loci' just don't matter.\n \n \n\n We can test what ensues by mutating those sites on purpose - you seem to think something different will happen if it's an accident, yet you can provide no rational justification for that.\n\n \n **\n Aside from the fact that this statement is untrue, \"mutating those sites on purpose\" bears little connection to \"accidental mutation\", unless they are simply destructive in both cases. Like slashing a car's tires on purpose or accidentally running over a batch of broken bottles, nobody expects anything but flat tires. The same does not apply to the origins of novel adaptive organismic traits.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n You are looking at everything backwards. First, the organism does not know whether or not any genetic mutation that it has not itself generated as a response to given externally arriving stimulus will prove advantageous, or else destructive, once expressed. That is why, whenever possible, it repairs such mutations as best it can, without waiting 'to see what happens'. \n \n \n You seem to be acknowledging that exogenously induced genetic change can prove advantageous.\n\n \n **\n Oh, please, you are reading stuff in that just is not there. I am not talking about just any exogenously induced genetic change. I am not including medical benefits brought about by genetic engineering to repair genetic defects, for example. I am clearly only referring to random changes to inherited genetic material. \n \n Gee I wish that you would stop deliberately distorting what I say.",

But only that section of genome is spliced, and the trait still arises. So the genetic change is all that's necessary. And since only the genetic change is necessary, then it's sufficient even if it occurs at random.\n \n \nAs above, your reasoning is wonky. In the case of origins, of which I was speaking, \"gene-trait pathways\" have to be established by the organism;\n\n \n Gene splicing shows this to be false: the target organism could possess no such pathway.\n \n \nthat is, in the case of adaptive traits, a new gene is _not_ generated spontaneously that then determines the expressed organismic trait directly, unaffected by anything but itself, by creating a linear, chemical pathway all by itself that results inevitably in a particular adaptive organismic trait. That is just your metaphysical supposition.\n\n \n No, that's my logical inference from the successful induction of traits via gene splicing.\n \n \nMy supposition is that in the case of the _origin_ of _adaptive_ traits, information about the stimulus is transmitted by the organism to its genome, and the organism establishes an adaptive trait response, a gene that codes for it, and a chemical-information 'pathway' that links the two.\n\n \n Which is a nice story, but one for which you have no evidence, and against which I have ample quantities. Lab techs don't splice 'chemical information pathways' or 'adaptive trait responses'. They just splice the gene. And it still works.\n \n \nIn the same way thaty the mutilated mice 'played along', i.e., there wasn't a damn thing they could do about what had been done them. As a species, they had to generate a new generation in order to get their tails back. \n\n \n Funny how the bacteria don't do that, then. The next generation of those are born 'without tails'. So exogenous changes work - so long as they occur to the genome, not the phenotype.\n \n As an aside, the tail-docking experiment is valid. In their environment, growing a tail was a pointless waste of energy for those mice. So why did generation after generation keep growing them? Sure, the uselessness of the tail is induced by an external agent, but so what? So is every other environmental stimulus you say organisms can genetically adapt to. Why is tail docking any different to food being high up out of reach?\n \n \nNo we have not. We have established that random genetic mutations can happen at any locus. We have not established that certain genetic loci are, per se or in se, 'helpful' ,\n\n \n Well, no, quite right; the effect of the mutation, in terms of it being good or bad, is dependent upon the environmental context.\n \n Which is what's been perplexing me about your stance all along, really: you say random changes can only be harmful. But changes that later prove helpful often are harmful in the present environment. So what justification do you have for saying they can't happen at random? Your metaphysic, and the axiom you allege supports it, don't help you here. It's perfectly OK, even according to your metaphysic, for a random mutation to induce, say, antibiotic resistance in the absence of an antibiotic, because it's a costly and useless waste, and immediately harms that organism's efficiency and ability to compete. The same for a gene duplication that seeds the cell wall with an excess of a receptor for a non-limiting nutrilite - unless that nutrilite later becomes scarce that excess of receptors is a hindrance. So again, no metaphysical objection can be raised to it occurring at random.\n \n \nTherefore there is no causal link between random mutations at a genetic locus and any beneficial organismic mutations that may be recorded at that locus.\n\n \n Evidence?\n \n \nNo idea by what you mean by \"the same thing happens\", but I do know that cells do try to repair DNA, but that that doesn't mean that they always succeed. Mutants happen.\n\n \n Sure, and they exhibit the same biological traits - 'the same thing happens' be those mutations deliberately or randomly induced. So why shouldn't the same thing happen with mutations linked to helpful traits?\n \n \nYou are the only one \"interested\" in the \"sites\" for their own sakes. I don't think they matter unless and until they are linked to an organismic trait, one way or another. Up to that point, your 'loci' just don't matter.\n\n \n See above, re gene splicing disproving the existence of such a 'link'.\n \n \n\"mutating those sites on purpose\" bears little connection to \"accidental mutation\", unless they are simply destructive in both cases. Like slashing a car's tires on purpose or accidentally running over a batch of broken bottles, nobody expects anything but flat tires. The same does not apply to the origins of novel adaptive organismic traits.\n\n \n Why not? The gene is the same either way afterwards; what grounds do you have for predicting a different outcome?",

No, you probably aren't joking, more's the pity. Pity, because now I have to go into another long explanation of why tailess mice and long-necked giraffes have no connection to or correlation with each other, neither as causes nor as effects.\n \n First, let's talk effects. How does a giraffe's long neck relate to a mutilated mouse's hind end? I can think of absolutely no connection that can be made here, so I'll leave that to you to explain to me.\n \n Second, let's talk causation. In the giraffe's case, you still suppose, despite my giraffe rant, that the darwinist 'causal' POV, [i.e., that organisms are passive and they only can change when external agents change them], and so you assert that 'high leaves' are the exogenous mechanical cause of long necks in lamarckian theory, [the giraffes physically stretch their neck cells, flesh and bone, when repeatedly reaching for them] whereas they are actually, according to darwinism, exogenously caused by random mutagens or entropy, and have nothing whatever to do, causally, with 'high leaves'. Although, coincidentally, getting to the 'high leaves' is a nice after-effect.\n \n Well, as it happens, not even Lamarck said that the very flesh of giraffes necks was elastically, physically stretched over the giraffe's lifetime. So darwinists are wrong when they claim that Lamarck claimed that 'high leaves' exogenously and mechanically accounted for the giraffe's neck. OTH, a sharp knife and a cruel neo-darwinist [or farmer's wife] most certainly do account exogenously and mechanically for the absence of mouse tails. So the cause of the longness of the giraffe's neck and the tailessness of the mice, are not as you suppose, similar examples of the same 'exogenous mechanical causation', only using different exogenous agents as efficient causes.\n \n Now, as for the mice, and so for gene-splicing, there is no doubt that the effect of the event has an immediate, proximate, endogenous efficient cause.\n Neo-darwinist cuts off tail, genetic engineer inserts foreign gene.The similarity in causation in these instances is indisputable. Both are deliberate actions taken by intelligent, volitional, external actors, to suit their own purposes, and in neither case does the poor organism have any control over what's being done to it, for better or for worse.\n \n OTH hand, the giraffe, as I explained in my previous post, simply got as big as forage allowed and predation necessitated. And along with the long legs, it developed a long neck. With this long neck it gained access to even more forage, and a chronic opportunity to robustly improve its ability to survive, thrive, and reproduce. Added to advatages of being tall [long-legged]was the\n disadvantage of not being able to get a drink of water at a predator infested water-hole without wading or kneeling down, except that the accompaning long neck solved that problem, too. But how? By internal, endogenous feedback from parent to fetus during the generations in which the giraffe was evolving from its okapi-like ancestors. Evo-devo. Endogenous, internal, vitalist causation. Not to be confused with leaves, knives, stretched flesh, hacked flesh, or inserted foreign genes.\n \n Two hundred years ago, Lamarck, the man who coined the word, 'biology', and a professional scientist unlike the gentleman dilettante, Darwin who \"borrowed\" from his work, sans credit, proposed that organisms possessed internal entities that carried information about the world and the organism's encounters with it, throughout the body. Thus, where the body needed something, it became aware of it, and did something about it. That is , internal resources were controlled, directed, and distributed internally. Biofeedback, so to speak. The organism as a self-sustaining system. Muscles that worked hard often grew large. Muscles that did only a little work grew smaller, or remained small. That which was not used at all, atrophied entirely. He saw empirical examples of this \"use it and increase it, dis-use it and lose it\" expression of biological conservation of energy in his day, just as we can still see it today. So he saw endogenous causation taking place internally throughout biology. But,since he had no theory of inheritance, [Mendel's theory was almost 100 years to come], he had to leave the actual mechanism for the transfer of acquired characteristics from one generation to the next, rather vague. \n \n Just too sleepy to continue.

The success rate is quite low and we have to use techinques not too dissimilar from those of the Lederberg experiment to find the dresired spliced cells. The splice often does not incorporate at all. It sometimes incorporates in a way such that its not expressed, it incorporates in an an unstable way, and even actively expressed splices differ considerably in their levels of expression. In addition the active slpices do not all integrate at the same position in the target DNA. Gene splicing is not the precision process that many think.\n \n In additon in nature HGT is a very hit or miss proposition. As an example see the paper I posted recently in which a parasite geneome ends up partially to completely incorporated in insects. The degree of incorporation and the postion varies greatly (and this is a natural case mind you).\n \n However the fact that a splice properly located in a different species being expressed such as in crown gall is indicative of no need for intent. I have to agree with that viewpoint.\n \n WW you would be much better off if you could demonstrate the formation of intent by brainless organismis and if you could explicate a means by which an organism COULD rewrite its own genome to correspond to that \"intent\".

But they are not, and you're wrong. \n\n \n So... care to elaborate?\n \n \nExcept that the 'genetic change' that is 'gene-splicing' involves a piece of 'code' that determines a pathway to a trait that was established, long ago and faraway, in another organism, by that organism. \n\n \n So the gene does contain everything necessary. And since, as we agreed, all sites are subject to random mutation, random mutation could have been responsible for all of it.\n \n Or are we back to saying that some sites are immune from RM?\n \n \nThis, despite your deliberate obtusness in the face of my repeated explanation, is a whole different bowl of wax from the _origination_ of the gene, its pathway, and the trait.\n\n \n Ok, look: you're saying that a single-step mutation (eg an insertion, point mutation etc) isn't enough to 'originate' the trait. Yet you also say the gene contains all that's necessary to confer the trait (hence the success of gene splicing). You seem to be saying that long, long ago in a galaxy far, far away the organism designed that gene so that the single mutation we see now would produce the specific altered trait that we observe. Is that about right?\n \n Here's why I find that rather less than convincing:\n \n 1. The nylon-eating bug, where two simple mutations enabled it to digest a man-made product that had never existed before. There is no conceivable way that bacteria could have 'long long ago' designed the rest of the gene so that those mutations would have that intended effect. The fact that the modified gene could process nylon (badly) can only be a coincidence.\n \n 2. Man-made antibiotics, for the same reason. We can take them out into the middle of the rainforest where no bacterium has ever encountered them, and those bacteria will develop resistance by the same simple mutations. Again, it's impossible that they could have long, long ago designed their genes to be a lightswitch-flick away from resistance. If things work the way you claim, then exposure to a novel stimulus would necessitate large scale genetic re-engineering to create the 'pathway' you describe. Yet we never, ever see that happen.\n \n 3. With a mechanism at their disposal such as the one you describe - the ability to intelligently design a gene to have not just one purpose, but a plethora of intentionally different ones a base-switch away - why do bacteria rely, as they empirically do via their hypermutational response mechanism, on a scattergun approach to adaptation, allowing errors to flick switches in the hope that one of them is the right one? That's insane. \"I've designed this incredible gene, but I can't remember how it works!\"\n \n \nWhy do you keep insisting that 'gene-splicing', [i.e., simple, mechanical, geographic transferance] and the origin of an adaptive organismic trait, the creation of its chemical pathway to the genome, and the origin of the particular chemical complex that symbolically records these two accomplishments, are not the same thing!?!?!\n\n \n I think you got a bit confused there. I'm not saying they are the same thing. I'm saying that if they have the same effect, then what is being transferred encapulates all that is necessary.\n \n \nIt does not have to, since both the 'pathway' and the trait it leads to have already been 'written into' the 'gene' by the orginal organism.\n\n \n See above for why this is unlikely and unconvincing. You really do love your unfalsifiable conjectures :)\n \n \nOh, really? And you know this,-- how exactly?\n\n \n Because once it was grown, the tail was cut off. Therefore it wasn't any use. So why didn't the mice stop wasting energy growing them?\n \n If mice were getting caught by their tails by some predator, you'd be the first to describe a proliferation of tailless mice as an adaptive response, and you'd dismiss out of hand notions of natural selection favouring tailless mutants. Here we have an analogous situation - why aren't they responding?\n \n The rest of your explanation is superfluous. I fully understand the difference between an exogenous and endogenous change. The point you're missing is that the mice didn't make an endogenous change to adapt to an environment where their tails kept getting cut off.\n \n Anyway, this is all getting way off track.\n \n To summarize: you've agreed that random mutations can and do occur across the genome, and you've even agreed that such events can trigger what you describe as the 're-expression' of a trait. And every experiment ever performed shows a pattern of adaptation entirely consistent with that 'random re-expression'. You're now pinning everything on the unsupported conjecture that long ago the organism's ancestors 'must have' designed the rest of the gene so that that mutation would have that specific effect.\n \n I've challenged that by pointing out that we can take modern antibiotics anywhere on earth and expose bacteria to them for the first time, and the same simple mutations confer resistance - no 'gene reconstruction' or 'creation of a pathway'. The same goes for the nylon-eating bug.\n \n The other remaining point from my earlier post, for your reference:\n \n \nWhich is what's been perplexing me about your stance all along, really: you say random changes can only be harmful. But changes that later prove helpful often are harmful in the present environment. So what justification do you have for saying they can't happen at random? Your metaphysic, and the axiom you allege supports it, don't help you here. It's perfectly OK, even according to your metaphysic, for a random mutation to induce, say, antibiotic resistance in the absence of an antibiotic, because it's a costly and useless waste, and immediately harms that organism's efficiency and ability to compete. The same for a gene duplication that seeds the cell wall with an excess of a receptor for a non-limiting nutrilite - unless that nutrilite later becomes scarce that excess of receptors is a hindrance. So again, no metaphysical objection can be raised to it occurring at random.\n",

Modern genomics has proved this fact.\n \n Modern genomics has done this by proving that there is no determined, 1-to-1 , no \"This \"gene\" must result in this trait\", or , \"This particular trait must originate in this particular \"gene\", or it won't exist\". That is just not the way it is in the real world, but only in the genetic determinist's metaphysical\n world. Even your beloved \"gene-splicing\" is NOT the simple, straightforward mechanical, \"insert chemical here, watch trait inevitably come out there\", cause/effect event that you are falsely claiming it to be. And 'gene-splicing', as I keep repeating to no profit, is merely the tranfer of a chemical code that symbolically records the instruction about the pathway that leads to a trait. And getting organisms, via 'gene-splicing', to follow those established, written out but alien instructions, even as difficult as that seems to be for the determinist GMO gene-splicers, is but a kindergarten game compared to the actual work involved in the origination of the trait, that is,the construction of an organic contruction program, and writing that program for posterity using a symbolic juxtaposition of DNA molecules. Often one cluster of molecules [a \"gene\"?] at one 'locus', or 'point', relays the info needed for the organism to re-construct, replicate, a particular organismic structure or behaviour. But, as often as not, several molecular clusters at different 'loci' across the genome [is this one \"gene\", or several?], sometimes instructions for a replicating a certain trait in one sort of organism, sometimes for replicating a different trait in a different sort of organism. Or, sometimes, different molecular clusters, at a single locus or across several loci, 'code for' the same organismic trait in differenty sorts of organisms.\n \n All this is now proven empirical fact, not hypothetical speculation or metaphysical assumption, as was and is, \"genetic determinism\", among darwinist's from the 1920's to the present day. From Fisher up to and including people like chemist and your own good self, with Dawkins leading the parade, the false notion has been put forward as fact, even in this thread, by you, that given \"genes\" are changed [mutate], or even, that novel genes 'spontaneously self-generate' [mutate], where no \"genes\" have gone before', and that these kinds chemical changes in the status quo, [genetic mutations], one of them entropic, the other miraculous, can and do, all by their little ol' lonesomes, mechanically determine just what a poor, passive little ol' organism would _have to_ look like and act like in the next generation of such organisms. But that notion, long before you strated arguing that positionm in this thread, was shot dead as a duck by modern science. So I get really, really, tired and annoyed listening to you repeat, ad nauseum, metaphysical assertions that depend entirely, (for any plausibilty), on the debunked, 'genetic determinism', mythology.\n \n Here's a flash for you, Dawkins, and all the other mechanists; an adaptive trait precedes the gene that records it, not the other way round, as you've been proselytizing for decades. A gene that symbolically 'codes for' an adaptive/productive novel trait does not precede that adaptive trait, it results from it.\n Originally the pathway is--\n \n 'environmental stimulus-<organismic response-<adaptive organismic trait vis a vis said environmental factor-< replication instructions for the novel adaptive trait written into genome--\n \n -- using DNA molecules as the medium for its message to posterity.

I'm saying that if they have the same effect, then what is being transferred encapulates all that is necessary.\n\n \n **\n I know that you are trying to avoid talking about origins, i.e., evolution', by talking about evolution's after-effects. Darwinists have been doing that since the invention of 'natural selection'. But I am here to discuss evolution; not ecology and not biometrics, not even inheritance. That is why I insist that this discussion deal with organismic trait origins, not their possible post-origin after-effects.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n It does not have to, since both the 'pathway' and the trait it leads to have already been 'written into' the 'gene' by the orginal organism. \n \n \n See above for why this is unlikely and unconvincing. You really do love your unfalsifiable conjectures \n\n \n **\n Wow, the irony of hearing this from someone whose entire position is founded upon the unfalsifiable conjecture that accidental genetic generation [spontaneos generation] mechanically determines [genetic determinism] organismic traits that are only 'coincidentally' suited to a local set of environmental factors[natural 'selection'[which in no way means 'selection' as that word is understood by the English-speaking, non-darwinist world]!!\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Oh, really? And you know this,-- how exactly? \n \n \n Because once it was grown, the tail was cut off. Therefore it wasn't any use. So why didn't the mice stop wasting energy growing them?\n\n \n **\n You starting to sound just as irrational as chemist! I truly cannot be bothered with inanity.\n \n \n\n If mice were getting caught by their tails by some predator, you'd be the first to describe a proliferation of tailless mice as an adaptive response, and you'd dismiss out of hand notions of natural selection favouring tailless mutants. Here we have an analogous situation - why aren't they responding?\n\n \n **\n First, because there is no analogy between what Weismann did and what ##### cats may sometimes do. To say that there is a real resemblance is utterly stupid. For one thing, cats do not chop off tails and just eat that tail, leaving the mutilated mouse to run away and generate more mice. If a cat gets the tail, it gets the mouse with it.\n \n Second, just because otherwise cared-for, tailess mice go on living in a cage, does not mean that wild mice do not have a good use for the tails that they are born with, and that so will their off-spring, and their off-spring's off-spring. Nor is there any reason to suppose that, aside, apart, and independent of this natural need, caged mouse organisms should somehow realize that their tails are going to be cut off, just like Wiesmann's jewish foreskin, and stop producing tails for that simple reason. If foreskins did not serve any organic purpose, then circumcision, (a cultural, artificial, unnatural event directly analogous to mouse-tail chopping, [except that I suspect that the organic utility of a human fore-skin is nowhere near as great as that of a mouse-tail to a mouse]), would have been rendered unnecessary for human organisms many generations back. God this stuff is ridiculous!! Why am I touching it with a ten foot pole?!?!\n \n \n\n The rest of your explanation is superfluous. I fully understand the difference between an exogenous and endogenous change. The point you're missing is that the mice didn't make an endogenous change to adapt to an environment where their tails kept getting cut off.\n\n \n *8\n And what you aren't gettiong is that their is no earthly reason why they should, since the act serves Weismann's purposes, not theirs!! Why should the mice do him a favour by saving him the effort of chopping their tails of?? My god but conversation is silly!\n \n \n\n Anyway, this is all getting way off track.\n\n \n **\n No, not just 'off-track'. Right off the wall!\n \n \n\n To summarize: you've agreed that random mutations can and do occur across the genome, and you've even agreed that such events can trigger what you describe as the 're-expression' of a trait. And every experiment ever performed shows a pattern of adaptation entirely consistent with that 'random re-expression'.\n\n \n **\n Say what?!?!? What does your last sentence mean, in English?\n \n [quote]\n You're now pinning everything on the unsupported conjecture that long ago the organism's ancestors 'must have' designed the rest of the gene so that that mutation would have that specific effect.[/quote\n \n **\n No, I'm basing my POV on the fact that once upon a time, maybe not that long ago, that trait and that \"gene\" did not exist. Want to deny that? Furthermore, I'm basing my POV on the second fact that creation and reproduction are not the same processes. Care to deny that? Most darwinists would deny it, since it is basic to their metaphysic that evolution is nothing but inheritance gone awry.\n \n \n\n I've challenged that by pointing out that we can take modern antibiotics anywhere on earth and expose bacteria to them for the first time, and the same simple mutations confer resistance - no 'gene reconstruction' or 'creation of a pathway'.\n\n \n **\n That would be a nice point, were it not blatantly false. When it comes to brand new humanly designed antibiotics, your beloved L&D'43 and L&L'51 just do not work. All the bacteria die, if all the cells in the colony are exposed to the toxin. It does not matter that you breed them down to a single cell, as in the antique experiments, since in this case the chemical is one to which noe of the bacteria have any kind of systematic resistance to it, anywhere in their present or their past. Every cell exposed to the toxin dies, and it does not matter a hoot whether that cell lives in the Amazon rain forest, or Pfizer's lab dish. If that were not the case with an original antibiotic, the drug company that invented it would throw it aside as ineffectual. It would never reach the market, let alone the Amazon.\n \n What actually happens, in this, the real world, is that the drug company invents an antibiotic that kills every single bacteria cell that encounters it. Then, several , maybe thousands, of generations later, we suddenly have a strain that is impervious to the poison. This happens, not just occasionally, but, so far, every damn time.\n \n How do you guys explain this recurrent phenomenon? Why, magically, by spontaneous generation. That is, where once no bacteria cell in the history of the world was ever immune to this formerly lethal toxin, now, out of nowhere and nothing, creatio ex nihilo, ab nihilo, we have those that are.\n You call your spontaneous generation, 'random genetic mutation', as if that product label changed it from a superstitious appeal to magic, into a scientific mechanism for evolution and adaptation. Call it what you like, it's still snake-oil, even though you've marketed a trillion gallons of it over the past 80 years.\n \n What really happens is that information is communicated by dying bacteria cells to bacteria cells that are not directly affected by the new toxin. Thes cells take that info and start mutating, heuristically, guided by the info, and after generations of new bacteria, feedback and info communicated to more bacteria and more heuristic cell changes, the the bacteria as a specieis, [first as a cell, then a colony, then a 'strain', then across the board, even in some colonies that were never directly exposed, but via HGT, that resistance info becomes universal, and that erstwhile effective, 'novel' antibiotic joins all the others on the medical scrapheap. Just plain defeated by intelligent micro-organisms; not some lucky mechanical accident.\n \n Break time.",

   "\n The other remaining point from my earlier post, for your reference:\n \n Which is what's been perplexing me about your stance all along, really: you say random changes can only be harmful.\n\n \n **\n I say that random changes in a complex productive system can only be harmfyl, anti-productive, anti-adaptive, to a greater or lesser degree, from downright lethal to nearly inconsequential, trivial, what you call 'neutral'.\n \n There are two complex productive systems involved here. One is the organism itself, the other is its sub-system, the genome. When we talk about adapted or maladapted, we speak directly only to the organismic system. The contents of the genomic system, \"genes\" or whatever, are only adaptive or maladaptive depending upon how they connect to the organismic system. In and of themselves they are nothing. That is to say, a \"gene\" is called 'adaptive' if, and only if, it can be shown that that \"gene\" determines a specific organismic trait, and that trait is indeed adapted to the organisms environment.\n \n Randomly changing a gene that has, at present, no known relation to anything morphologically or behaviourally expressed by an organism, [and I am given to believe that the vast majority of \"genes\" fall into that category], into another moleculat configuration, a 'mutant gene', that also has no discernible organismic effect, is a difference that makes no difference and, randomly caused or artificially caused, since it has no effect on the organism, it is not, per se, good, bad, or indifferent. It is merely insignificant, apparently no more than a collection of 'letters' that do not form a word that anything can read.\n \n You want to qualify only certain mutant genes as such, calling them, as I said, neutral. But aside from being a convenient label, all \"genes\" are neutral, to begin with, in and of themselves. Only when a pathway has been established between a novel gene and a novel organismic trait can we begin to semantically connect a \"gene\" to a trait, and describe the \"gene\" in terms of the trait, i.e., adaptive trait-<adaptive gene, maladaptive trait-< maladaptive gene.\n \n So what constitutes the difference in origins between a 'maladaptive gene' and an 'adaptive gene'. It is this. A maladaptive gene is said to be maladaptive in case--\n \n A/ it is an established [I believe that geneticists say 'fixed'] \"gene\" that encoded a trait that was historically adaptive, but, thanks to a random change in the organism's environment, is now maladaptive. That is, the organism's environment has now randomly, coincidentally, mutated the 'value' of that \"gene\", [by extension from the trait it codes for], from positive to negative wrt 'fitness', [however you define that word].\n \n Such a gene must be mutated to the point where it no longer leads to the organismic expression of the now maladaptive trait. If it is a serious, chronic, vital maladaptation at the organismic level, the gene must be mutated or silenced, or the organism will fail to survive, thrive, and reproduce. Mechanically, according to darwinism, it must be mutated by entropy or by some other random cause, such as a passing mutagen. EAM , OTH, would opt for epigenetic gene silencing, an intelligent, systematic approach to the problem.\n \n B/ a gene may also be switched in value from adaptive to maladaptive if it originally codes for an adaptive trait, but thanks to entropic copy failure, or the action of some random mutagen, or the will of some genetic engineer, it is no longer imbued with the correct information connected to that adaptive trait. Such are genetic disorders, at least originally. This is what is most commonly meant when saying, 'maladaptive random genetic mutation'. Mainly, when I speak of a 'maladaptive mutation' and/or a 'random mutation', this is what I am referring to.\n \n Once again, such \"genes\" can have their 'values' [adaptive vs maladaptive] changed from maladative back to 'adaptive' by either blind luck, i.e., reversal by accident mutation, as per darwinism, or, systematically, by an organismically directed, intelligent and volitional, 'revertant mutation', as per EAM. Revertant mutations are the fact of the matter, here.\n \n Now let us deal with what we call 'adative' or 'positive' genes, and their origins.\n \n A/ An 'adaptive gene' is not adaptive _until_ an organic pathway between some molecules of DNA, [ that are not yet a 'gene' IMO, but probably seen as a \"gene\" by genetisists] and an adaptive [ergo established, expressed] organismic trait. That is the value of the trait must be established _before_ the value of the gene can be asessed. This would suiggest that the metaphysical darwinian assumption that \"gene precedes trait\", itself highly questionable, cannot possibly apply wrt the value [positive/negative] of the \" gene\", [i.e., associated acid molecules, or whatever]. \n \n Now, the thing about these associated acid molecules, no matter what their conformation, is that they mean nothing to anything unles there already exists an organismic mutation that they can code for. The notion that any old combination of DNA molecules, thrown together in any old higgledy-piggleday fashion, MUST determine an organismic trait expression of some kind or other, is as dead as the dodo.\n That is not the reality. It is the kin of the other absurd darwinian inanity, that is, that if you sit a trillion monkeys at a trillion keyboards for a trillion years, they then MUST reproduce the entire works of Shakespeare, with every comma in its proper place. That is NOT how meaningful writing is generated, neither in \"genes\", nor in literary works. Not even a little bit.\n \n Randomly assembled signs and symbols can never contain productive information. They must at least contain some recognisable systematic order based upon a pre-established sign system in order to impart any information whatever to a reader. That is why higgledy-piggledy DNA configurations do not create new organismic traits, or if they do, they are always negatively impacting. But that is what any \"random genetic mutation\" is;--a higgledy-piggledy nonsense collection of molecules, whose only power could possibly be to screw up, [see above, maladaptive mutations], the way things were systematically arranged to be.\n \n The fact is, that until a novel adaptive trait is constructed, DNA cannot code for it, and DNA still cannot code for it until after the organism has created a 'pathway' [RNA?] from that novel trait down to its genome, and then used DNA to record the information about the novel trait. And the organism is not going to do that unless and until, like the the drug company's antibiotic, the trait proves that it works/is adaptive. Mutant adaptive traits always precede mutant 'adaptive' genes, and such genes are not random, but are 'informed' by the organism.\n \n Note that we are speaking of ORIGINS here, and not later effects, random or otherwise induced.\n \n Now, all you have to do to prove me wrong is engineer a random, higgledy-piggledy _novel, original_ assemblage of DNA molecules, call it a \"gene\", splice it into some poor organism's genome, and then point out the wonderfully adaptive novel trait that emerges in the next generation. I won't be holding my breath.\n \n [quote]\n But changes that later prove helpful often are harmful in the present environment.[quote]\n \n **\n Really? Please cite a half-dozen unequivocal examples of destructive random genetic mutations [ie., those that lead to a maladaptive organismic trait under established, normal circumstances], that _later on _ proved productive [i.e., the trait's value switched from negative to positive thanks to a later-occurring random change in environmental circumstances].\n \n The fact is, despite over 150 years of searching high and low, you guys have only one solitary example of a negative genetic mutation [for sickle cell anaemia] that has any positive effect at all [contra malaria], and you cannot even demonstrate that that occurred _prior_ to the malaria parasite appearing, nor that it was strictly 'random' when it did appear. IMO, it probably was random, since in overall terms of improved survival, well-being, and reproduction, it has not done the involved population any real good where it originated [as many die from debilitation caused by sickle cell as from debilitation caused by the malaria parasite, hence no increase in 'fitness' in your terms, i.e., populastion terms, locally. Worse, the anaemia follows where the parsites do not, and in those populations the mutated gene codes for a trait that is out and out maladaptive, negative. Now, it could be that in an heuristic attempt to find a solution to the malaria problem, the local genotype generated an unsatisfactory response upon which it has been unable to improve, but to me it looks like a straightforward entropic genomic accident that persists by not being totally lethal. Much like some other random genetic disorders. Colour-blindness, for example. Now, you may possibly comeup with a scenario where it would be good in an exceptional set of circumstance for a person to be colour blind, but surely you would never advance the notion that colour blindness incorporated into the human race by an accidental genetic mutation would constitute an adaptive organismic mutation, would you? Not even with the darwinist tendency to hunt up anomalies as proof for their uiversal assertions?\n \n \n\n So what justification do you have for saying they can't happen at random? \n\n \n **\n See above. Laid it all out for you.\n \n \n\n Your metaphysic, and the axiom you allege supports it, don't help you here. It's perfectly OK, even according to your metaphysic, for a random mutation to induce, say, antibiotic resistance in the absence of an antibiotic, because it's a costly and useless waste, and immediately harms that organism's efficiency and ability to compete. \n\n \n **\n Nonsense, it is not \"perfectly OK\". It's not even 'slightly' or ' sort-of', OK. It just does not, cannot, happen, \"according to [my] metaphysic\". How do you dream up these unfounded conclusions?\n \n \n\n The same for a gene duplication that seeds the cell wall with an excess of a receptor for a non-limiting nutrilite - unless that nutrilite later becomes scarce that excess of receptors is a hindrance. So again, no metaphysical objection can be raised to it occurring at random. \n\n \n **\n Of course it can. Metaphysically and empitically the objection can be raised that gene duplications are not random, but systematic cellular mechanisms, unless the duplication is exogenously forced by a bio-engineer. In which case it is not natural, but artificial, and hence a red herring.",

This happens, not just occasionally, but, so far, every damn time.\n\n \n Starting with 8., I'd like to know whether you think the genomic encoding of this novel trait involves a whole new gene (new chunk of chromosome) unrelated to any previously existing gene, a modification to an existing gene, or either, depending upon the trait.\n \n Returning to 1., my eye is drawn to the words 'already exists'. I'd like to establish what exactly you mean by that. So far as I can see, there are the following possibilities for the nature of the 'encoding' you describe:\n \n a) The new or changed gene indexes the trait, rather than encoding it. The information about the trait is all stored elsewhere, outside the genome, and the organism just 'looks it up' and implements it when it encounters that gene. \n \n Non-biological analogy: adding or changing an item on a takeaway restaurant menu. The menu changing by itself will have no effect; the chefs in the kitchen won't know what to do.\n \n b) The new or changed gene encodes some fraction of the information about the novel trait, but there are also associated changes to the developmental machinery that decodes that information, without which the trait would not be complete.\n \n Non-biological analogy: adding or changing an instruction on a computer processor. Some of the information (eg the amount to add, divide etc) is encoded in part of the instruction, but the operation (add, divide etc) is encoded in the processor and indexed by the remainder of the instruction.\n \n c) The new or changed gene encodes all the information necessary for the existing developmental machinery to express the novel trait.\n \n Non-biological analogy: a novel set of flat-pack furniture instructions handed to someone who already has a screwdriver, hammer, endless patience etc.\n \n Going back to what you mean by 'already exists', I can see that scenario a) and scenario b) are compatible with your conjecture: something unique to that trait does indeed 'already exist' for the gene to index or be decoded by. In these scenarios, there is a definite distinction between the origin of the trait and its re-expression (accidental or otherwise) caused by the re-occurrence of the indexing/encoding gene.\n \n Scenario c) on the other hand, is not compatible with your conjecture. It might be true that in some other other organism, somewhere else in time and space, that gene and hence that trait have already existed, but the gene and the trait in no way already exist within an organism to which the mutation occurs. In scenario c) the wheel is reinvented each time (contradicting 7.), and the billionth time it is 're-expressed' is indistinguishable from the first time it ever occurred.\n \n If it can be established that scenario c) can and does occur (note: not 'does always' occur, merely 'can'), then 1. and 2. are shown to be false, and 8. shown to be unnecessary in that instance.\n \n With me so far?\n \n Moving on, we come to my questioning of the applicability of your metaphysic to situations where mutations are detrimental to an organism's efficiency in the present environment and only later prove helpful.\n \n RE 5.: In many cases, antibacterial resistance entails a decrease in organismic efficiency in the absence of the antibiotic, yet it emerges in unexposed populations. I know you say this is systematic and deliberate. That's your chosen interpretation of the (completely stochastic) pattern of emergence, and is not relevant to the question of whether your metaphysic forbids it from happening at random. Your metaphysical position is that a random change cannot improve the efficiency of a complex system. Fine: these changes do not improve the efficiency of that system. They degrade it.\n \n As you say yourself in 4. regarding colour blindness and sickle cell, the fact we can contrive a life-and-death situation where that degradation is advantageous (the 2nd world war in the case of colour blindness, endemic malaria in the case of sickle-cell) doesn't make the original mutation adaptive.\n \n Therefore, your metaphysic is silent as regards whether such mutations can be of random origin. Correct?\n \n Indeed, you completely give away the farm on this one by saying what you do in 6. If a genetic change is value-neutral in itself, then your metaphysic has nothing whatsoever to say about whether any genetic change can happen at random. So all I need to do is show an example of c) above, where a modified gene contains all the novel information required to express a trait, and it's game over.\n \n Finally, regarding 9.:\n \n What you are saying makes no sense. If the antibiotic killed every bacteria that came into contact with it, no adaptation would ever be possible by any mechanism. \n \n The point of an antibiotic is that it kills or inhibits cell division sufficiently for the body's own defences to gain the upper hand. That's why if you nuke someone's immune system, and they have an infection, antibiotics won't help them: you'll kill a lot of bacteria but those that weren't killed will just start all over again. You're depending upon the immune system to kill off the remaining resistant cells.\n \n Finally finally, do you think you could maybe dial back on the hostility and abuse, just a touch? Pouring scorn on an argument is not the same as showing it to be flawed, and you've done that a few times now.",

This was in direct response to us agreeing that such variants can and do occur at random, yes?\n\n \n **\n It seems to me that you are skipping lightly over some interconnecting points.\n I don't know what you thought I said, but what I thought I said was that interconnected chemicals, [i.e., DNA molecules interconnected at a given locus, which is often the chemical definition of a 'gene'], can be randomly reshuffled, physically, no matter what 'locus' they form. If you want call this new ly re-ordered, re-shuffled, re-arranged aggregation if DNA molecul, a \"variant [mutant?] gene\", as per the long-honoured definition of the word I just gave, then that's your right, I guess. But to me a 'gene' is a coded bit of meaningful information that an organism either needs to store in terms of heredity, or needs to generate in terms of origins/adaptation [evolution], or contains misinformation left over from an accidentally, entropically damaged 'gene' [bit of recorded info]. The writing of new info into molecules, supposedly DNA molecules, but maybe RNA molecules, or who knows what, does not happen by chance. Dawkins' silly 'million monkeys' appeal to the 'magick of great big numbers' notwithstanding, every novel rearrangement of DNA molecules at a given locus DOES NOT write a new and meaningful message, especially not a new and productive/adaptive message. Nor even replicate and old one, the genomic equivalent of a Shakespearean sonnet. It simply is not true that that, no matter how you juggle them about, aggregations of DNA molecules at certain loci, call them 'variant genes' as per the old concept of what a 'gene' is, if you will, but unless and _until_those chemical 'variants' actually 'code for' something meaningful, they don't really deserve to called, 'genes', and no new 'variant gene' comes into existence by 'random shuffling' and brings with it, spontaneously, any piece of meaningful information. Why not? Because organisms decide what is 'meaningful information' for them--'bits of stuff', be it DNA, RNA, a protein, a prion, a photon, a quark, or anything else contains meaningful information unless and until an organism uses its meaningless data to formulate, write, and store that meaningful info; meaningful in terms for itself and its offspring.\n \n Now, that information [that 'gene', in the modern concept], might be written into the 'genome' at one locus, or it may require several loci across the genome to make up a coherent message. The 'info' may use different DNA comboes for the same message in different kinds of organisms, or it may use the same DNA 'variants' to express different messages in different kinds of organisms. Anyway you look at it, one fact stands undeniable--the medium [DNA, RNA, whatever], is not the message [meaningful information]. We now know that meaningful info can be created, stored, and transmitted \"epigenetically\", which I take to mean, without involving DNA variants in those processes. So do we stick with the old chemical/molecular materialist concept of a 'gene', or do we employ a new psychical, 'information-based' concept of a 'gene', or do we invent a new word altogether?\n \n I of course opt for the 'information as 'gene', 'gene' as meaningful info', option.\n You'll just have to bear with me if I use 'gene' to mean 'information', not molecules. And that is why an accidental reshuffling of molecules means nothing unless and until the organism uses that configuration to write information, but, once that information has been written into that molecular configuration by the organism, its replication, once or a million times, accidental or intentionally, it should remain legible to the organism that reads the 'material', according to the rules of its particular genomic symbolic information system.\n \n So, finally coming to a summation, a meaningless 'variant gene' does nothing on its own, but if, later, an organism uses that same chemical variation to code for a trait, then ever after accidental replicates of that organism-coded molecular variant will be read the same as if that variant were intentional.\n \n Before you get excited, remember that this discussion is about creation, origins, evolution, and NOT about replication, inheritance, or the distribution/circulation of reproductions, genetic or organismic, coincidental or intentional.\n \n \n\n To return to scenario a) and our menu analogy where the gene is merely an index, the situation we're analysing would be like \"#9, Fish and Chips\" appearing on the menu. If the chefs don't already know what that means, nothing is going to turn up on the table. \n\n \n **\n Exactly so.\n As I've been explaining these past few posts, something like \"\"#9, Fish and Chips\" only has any effect because it means/indicates something else that pre-exists; it signifies something other than just its own being. That 'significance' cannot and does not happen by accident. There has to be a rule-governed system of information creation, storage and retrieval _before_ , already pre-existing, the writing of, \"#9, Fish and Chips\", before the creation of \"9, Fish and Chips\" can have any effect on the universe. Show \"#9, Fish and Chips\" to an illiterate, or non-english-speaking, person who shows up asking for a job, and you'll get nothing from him/her. Hand out menus at the take-out window that are written in Egyptian hieroglyphics, and you'll soon be out of business.\n \n \n\n You've agreed this happens, you know that's what we're talking about, so please, no more red herrings about 'mindless scrambles'.\n\n \n **\n Duh? [Scratches head vigourously]. This sounds like the very model of a 'non sequitur', to me, and 'non sequitur' is a fancy way of saying, \"red herring\".\n \n You do not seem to have grasped my point that appealing to the after- effects of evolution is a red-herring in a discussion of the the actual process of evolution itself. Added to which, postulating that everytime a novel 'chemical variant' [a mindless scramble] is spontaneously/accidentally generated, that therefore meaningful information is therefore generated, 'ipso facto', may not be a red-herring, but it's still silly.",

   "As I've been explaining these past few posts, something like \"\"#9, Fish and Chips\" only has any effect because it means/indicates something else that pre-exists; it signifies something other than just its own being. \n\n I'm happy to discuss that. What I wasn't happy with was the term 'mindless scramble' since it evoked a mental image of a scribble or scrawl; something that could never be meaningful in the context of a menu.\n \nThat 'significance' cannot and does not happen by accident.\n\n Here we get to the nub of the matter. Allow me to reprise my earlier post:\n \nI'd like to establish what exactly you mean by [pre-exists/already exists]. So far as I can see, there are the following possibilities for the nature of the 'encoding' you describe:\n \n a) The new or changed gene indexes the trait, rather than encoding it. The information about the trait is all stored elsewhere, outside the genome, and the organism just 'looks it up' and implements it when it encounters that gene.\n \n b) The new or changed gene encodes some fraction of the information about the novel trait, but there are also associated changes to the developmental machinery that decodes that information, without which the trait would not be complete.\n \n c) The new or changed gene encodes all the information necessary for the existing developmental machinery to express the novel trait.\n\n In scenarios a) and b), something must, as you say, 'already exist' for the accidental mimicry of a variant gene to give rise to the associated trait. That's because in a) and b) not all the novel information describing that novel trait is encoded in the gene: there have also been trait-specific changes to the surrounding developmental machinery that enable that information to be decoded correctly.\n \n However, the same is not true for scenario c). If all the novel information required for the trait is encoded in the variant gene, with no trait-specific changes to the surrounding machinery, then the accidental occurrence of that variant gene will give rise to the novel trait, even if that trait has never existed before in any other organism. That much is indisputable: before the genetic change, the organism has none of the novel information required for the trait to occur, whereas after the genetic change, the organism has all of the novel information required for the trait to occur. Nothing is missing, nothing else specific to that trait needs to 'pre-exist', because everything novel is encoded in the gene. In such a situation, the first and the billionth occurrence of this variant are indistinguishable: the wheel is reinvented every time. Therefore, if it can (and we've agreed it can) happen by accident the billionth time, it can happen by accident the first time.\n \n Do you appreciate the logic of this?\n \n To return to our restaurant analogy, in scenario c) the genetic change isn't equivalent to a new or altered menu item, it's a change to the recipe the chef works from down in the kitchen. If that recipe is accidentally blotted so that '1tsp salt' looks like '1/2tsp salt', the same chef and the same kitchen will put out a less salty dish - and there is no metaphysical requirement for the chef to have ever 'tried out' that particular variant recipe or deliberately encoded it previously. And if that variant dish is more palatable to the local clientel, it will increase in popularity - regardless of whether the change was deliberate or not.\n \n LATE EDIT: If you think that situation is ambiguous because the chef might 'remember' the old recipe and continue to use it, consider instead him passing his blotted recipe book down to his son. DNA must, after all, be useful for something; yes? So if the son recieves a recipe that includes '1/2tsp salt', that's how he's going to season the dish, no question about it.\n \n So, the question of 'can a random genetic change produce a helpful trait?' ultimately boils down to 'can I find an example where all the novel information required by the trait is encoded within the variant gene itself?'\n \n If I can find just one such example, your 'universal principle' is shattered.\n \n Should I go look?",

It is not that 'some' of the novel information regarding that novel trait is not encoded in the '\"gene\", [by which term you seem to mean nothing more than a particular assemblage of DNA molecules], prior to the existence of the trait, it's that NONE of the information can or does exist in any assemblage of molecules, be they DNA, RNA, or whatever, until after the TRAIT itself exists, along with the organic, developmental 'pathway' that the organism took while inventing that trait, even if the new trait is just a productive modification of an old trait.\n \n Nor can any additional, ' epigenetic' info wrt any productive trait be recorded anywhere else in the organism [RNA?] until AFTER the trait and its developmental pathway have been generated, and such complex processes do not, cannot, happen magically, spontaneously, randomly or coincidentally.\n Not in any rational universe, they can't.\n \n The only way that an accidental re-structuring of molecules [RM] could create a new and adaptive organismic trait is if, _as per darwinism_, traits are strictly particle-dependent; i.e., particles, all by themselves, deterministically generate accidental, unintentional organismic traits that only coincidentally [wrt environmental factors] prove productive for, and thus beneficial to, the organism that these molecules apparently rule and use in order to increase themselves comparitively, statistically. [see, \"selfish gene\", \"blind watchmaker\", '\"fitness\", \"natural selection\", and other similar materialist metaphysical assumptions]. However, in a rational universe it is impossible that added productivity can be generated mechanically simply and solely by breaking/ignoring the rules that govern the rule-ordered complex that makes up a system. It's just plain self-contradictory and irrational.\n \n \n [quote]\n However, the same is not true for scenario c). If all the novel information required for the trait is encoded in the variant gene, with no trait-specific changes to the surrounding machinery, then the accidental occurrence of that variant gene will give rise to the novel trait, even if that trait has never existed before in any other organism.[quote]\n \n **\n If you endorse \"c\", then you still do not understand. Your supposed \"fully informed\" collection of molecules simply cannot exist unless and until there is something there for them to be informed about. The molecules can be there, but until after the trait is organismically developed, they cannot signify anything, and thus do anything, because there is nothing there for them to signify. Not until after the trait is done and dusted. Therefore, any accidentally arranged set of molecules that in whole or in part codes for a given organismic trait, can only coincidentally code for a trait that prexisted it, along with the 'gene' for that trait that also must pre-exist it. Meaning that randomness can replicate, duplicate, mimic, but randomness cannot generate, i.e., create, originate, evolve. The notion that a fully informed gene can pre-exist the trait that it is informed about is an irrational red-herring, because it is an impossible scenario. That is, there is no option \"c\" in the real world.\n \n \n\n That much is indisputable: before the genetic change, the organism has none of the novel information required for the trait to occur, whereas after the genetic change, the organism has all of the novel information required for the trait to occur. Nothing is missing, nothing else specific to that trait needs to 'pre-exist', because everything novel is encoded in the gene.\n \n Do you appreciate the logic of this?\n\n \n **\n No, because it is nothing but a red-herring. It is a false postulate/assumption to suppose that an informed gene can pre-exist its correlated trait. The fact is that before the organic trait mutation the organism itself does not have information about it, anywhere, in its genes or any other part of its whole being.\n It takes novel information to match a novel trait, rationally speaking. The question is, where and how does novel information evolve? Does it start with a systematic heuristic process at the organismic level, where an organism psychically generates physical and behavioural changes in itself in order to improve its 'adaptedness' to a proximate environment, and then, only after it has managed that, passes that newly generated info on and into its genome, there to 'informed' molecules so that the info may be recorded for posterity? Or does some accidental genomic system failure create a random molecular combo that deterministicly generates a novel organismic trait that is only coincidentally adaptive, relative to random local environmental factors?\n \n That is the issue we are debating here. The latter position, the darwinist position, seems identical to option 'c', which, as above, I find to be utterly irrational.\n \n \n\n To return to our restaurant analogy, in scenario c) the genetic change isn't equivalent to a new or altered menu item, it's a change to the recipe the chef works from down in the kitchen. If that recipe is accidentally blotted so that '1tsp salt' looks like '1/2tsp salt', the same chef and the same kitchen will put out a less salty dish - and there is no metaphysical requirement for the chef to have ever 'tried out' that particular variant recipe or deliberately encoded it previously. And if that variant dish is more palatable to the local clientel, it will increase in popularity - regardless of whether the change was deliberate or not.\n\n \n **\n You assume that by simply 'blotting' a menu [actually, you've switched from numbered menu to quantified recipe], that you can change a '1' to a '1/2'. You cannot. All you can hope for is that the chef [following the example of Hamlet and Dawkins wrt the 'cloud/weasal' thing, projects his/her own mentality onto the 'smudge' on the 'recipe' and 'sees' a \"1/2\" where in fact there is no such thing. Real, genuine forms like \"1/2\" obey rules of identity that can only be followed intentionally when reproducing them.\n \n [quote]\n So, the question of 'can a random genetic change produce a helpful trait?' ultimately boils down to 'can I find an example where all the novel information required by the trait is encoded within the variant gene itself?'\n \n **\n No, that is still not right. The question was, is, and will remain, this--\"Can a random/unintentional change in the conformation of a given set of DNA molecules lead mechanically [deterministically] to a novel, productive, adaptive organismic trait that that kind of organism has never ever possessed before, in all its prior history, and thus, has never encoded/informed any molecules in its genome wrt that trait?\"\n \n To answer this affirmatively, you must first find a collection of DNA molecules that does not contain any information for any known 'trait', already existing anywhere, and then 'splice' that collectio [aka, 'gene'] into the genome of an organism that possesses no similar genes that already do code for known traits, and then watch and see if the gmo ends up with a novel, adaptive trait.

The gene concept was abstract at the time and not tied to specific molecular structure - indeed to any molecular structure. So that cannot be the raison d'etre for the original Darwinian theory, nor for NDS itself! All either postulated is that units of inheritance DO exist. That existense was NOT tied to any specific mechanism at the time other than empirical observations of genetic experiments, and to a certain extent to the observation of chromsomal behaviors. Twas not till the 1950s that molecular biology began to elucidate the underlying biochemistry of the polynucleic acids, and not till the 60s that the details of replication and of protein synthesis became well characterized. We have of course gone far beyond those pioneering efforts these days. You need to note well that RMNS can apply even to strings of binary digits which are allowed to vary randomnly and then filtered to obtain more optimized outcomes.

Apparently your obscure lingistic constructs have now driven you to a state of confusion.\n \n \n \nWhat you are trying to do is 'beg the question', by postulating a notional premise that is nothing more than your own conclusion. That is a red-herring, as well as a dead horse. No DNA aggregation signifies any information but that which an organism with a a developed trait then informs it to signify.\n \n\n \n Given your clearly confused state that seems most unlikely to be true. And if it is does it mean anything at all as stated?\n \n \nIn the case of a damaged, formerly informed 'gene', [one that has been involved in a, 'random accident', but which still retains some ordered molecules], some small portion of the info it used to be coded for, prior to the 'accident' may still be present.

See 'sickle-cell anaemia', for an example of this darwinist sophistry.\n\n \n Sickle cell trait is useful to more than a few members of the population where its prevalent. And the mechanism of both the trait, the sickle cell disease, and the resistance to Malaria are well characterized (if not totally so). Gotcha yet again. Whether or not the sickle cell gene . is a \"defect\" depends on the context. If you live with the constant threat of contracting malaria and dying or being reproductively compromised, then sickle cell trait is a feature not a bug. If you do not have to fight off the parasite then the gene is detrimental. Its context dependent. Or don't you have the IQ to grasp that concept?\n \n \nAs above, this supposition 'begs the question' of where the information came from and how it got into this 'variant' to begin with. \n\n \n Nope no question begging there at all. In the case of SCT the gene captured the fact that the parasite existed in the environment and that modifying the hemoglobin would give a measure of resistance resulting in a net fittness greater than if the hemoglobin was not modified. This information was bound into the DNA by an indirect feedback mechanism which is inherent in the vary-select-inherit process which is the core of NDS. The information came form the physical and biological environment, VSI bound it into the genes. Read ADAMI.\n \n \nYou are insisting as a premise that the information is simply, 'there', already complete, via the simple mechanical, unintentional generation of the molecular combo.

Why do you still keep pretending that the random occurrence of the variant 'recipe' is in doubt?\n \n \nPray tell, just how could such a scenario 'not matter' to a notion whose entire raison d'etre is the supposition that molecules determine traits?!?\n\n \n For the very simple reason we've chosen a variant gene that encapsulates all the novel information specific to that trait. The developmental mechanism, however complex it may be, is not altered. The same chef, the same kitchen, the same raw materials - only the recipe is different. In such a situation, how the recipe came to be different is irrelevant to what the final dish will taste like. It could have been deliberately altered, or there could have been a typesetting error - it doesn't matter. If you can prove otherwise, be my guest.\n \n \nNo DNA aggregation signifies any information but that which an organism with a a developed trait then informs it to signify.\n\n \n Once again, you claim that an altered recipe is meaningless and unintelligable unless the chef cooks the dish it describes first. This is clearly nonsense. A recipe can precede any attempt to cook it.\n \n \nBut all that reduced and/or distorted info can generate is a failed, partial trait, a genetic defect.\n\n \n Why? The exact same distortion to the information gives rise to a useful trait, according to you, provided the organism 'tests it out' first. Sure, if the change is random rather than deliberate then it represents an untested trait, but why should it produce a different result when decoded?\n \n The only way two identical code sequences (genes) can be decoded into two different results (traits) is if two different decoders are used. But we've already excluded that possibility by selecting a variant gene which encapsulates all the novel information.\n \n \nThe fact that a genetic defect may prove useful to a few individuals on a few occasions means nothing, because anomalies and lucky exceptions to the general rule do not pass for evidence of 'mechanisms' in any science, except only in darwinism. See 'sickle-cell anaemia', for an example of this darwinist sophistry.\n\n \n Oh really?\n \n Sickle cell is an efficiency-harming mutation that happens to confer resistance to a particular environmental toxin, yes? It's possessed by a tiny minority of organisms except in areas where that toxin is endemic, yes?\n \n Now, let's look at antibiotic resistance. Small, single step mutation? Check. Efficiency-harming in the absence of antibiotic? Check. Possessed by a tiny minority? Check - indeed, a far, far, far tinier minority than possess sickle cell. Confers resistance to a particular environmental toxin? Check. Arises in a population at more or less identical rates as other random mutations occur within the genome? Check.\n \n Doesn't seem to be all that much in it, does there?\n \n LATE EDIT: Most of the process above is a predictable, regular 'mechanism'. The resistant gene always works vs the antibiotic; it always confers the efficiency disadvantage, which always results in it bobbling along at the edge of extinction in normal colonies. The only way in which the process is not perfectly regular is in the occurrence of the trait, and that is still statistically predictable, and happens often enough for the same end result (resistant colonies emerging vs antibiotic) to occur pretty much every time (provided we allow the colony to grow to sufficient size for the odds of a resistant germ to approach 1.0). In short, it's precisely as regular and predictable as is necessary to explain what we see.\n \n I think the internal contradiction of your position is thrown into sharp relief by these two statements:\n \nThe fact that a genetic defect may prove useful\n\n \nThat is the value of the trait must be established _before_ the value of the gene can be asessed.\n\n If a genetic change is useful, in what sense is it a defect? Or to come at it the other way: is there any such thing as an objectively 'good' trait, one which could never under any circumstances, in any environment, ever be construed as defective compared to some slight variant? I'm not sure there is.\n \n To someone living at high latitudes, sickle-cell is a defect. To someone in malarial Africa, it's a resistance to an endemic toxin. Under most circumstances, colour blindness is a defect, but when you're trying to pick out a camouflaged sniper or armoured unit it can be a positive asset. The notion that there is an objectively 'better' variant of a gene is just not a realistic one. If, as you say, all value is relative to the circumstances, your axiom must surely throw up its hands and leave town, unable to even begin to define what it is that can't happen.\n \n \nAs above, this supposition 'begs the question' of where the information came from and how it got into this 'variant' to begin with. \n\n \n WW, information isn't a gel; you can't squirt it into one message but not another, completely identical one.\n \n Perhaps we've been using the wrong terminology: genes represent data. \"Information\" is the developmental machinery's interpretation of that data. Can random mutations create new data? Sure, and your axiom can't do a damn thing about it. Can the developmental machinery interpret that as new information? Sure, and we know it will, thanks to inheritence and gene splicing where the only novel data the organism has to derive the trait from is within the gene. There's no issue to resolve here, no question to beg.\n \n If you buy a cookbook and a typesetting error has changed the proportions of the ingredients in one recipe, can you tell it was accidental rather than deliberate? When reading the recipe, is your eye arrested by that line; do you think to yourself \"Hold on, that line looks like it says 1/2tsp salt, yet it doesn't contain \"the information\" that I would expect if this dish had already been cooked in this way before! I'd better ignore the recipe and put... heck, I dunno, a full tsp in, that's about right.\"",

How's that suit ya? \n \n \n It's almost like the last umpteen pages of debate never happened.\n \n We've already agreed that variant genes identical in every respect to the ones you claim encode novel traits can, and do, occur at random. Why do you still keep pretending that the random occurrence of the variant 'recipe' is in doubt?\n\n \n **\n Because no matter how many times I explain to you the difference between the construction of a bit of stuff and using a bit of stuff to encode information, you never ever 'get it'. You are perpetually stuck in the materialist groove that the 'medium' IS the 'message'. Added to that gross fallacy, is a second that is equally egregious--your assertion that to copy something is the same thing as to invent to invent something.\n \n If it weren't for these two false assumptions messing up your mind then you might have realized by now that randomly generated configurations of DNA molecules do not contain any information unless and until they mirror a configuration of DNA molecules that has been intelligently and intentionally used by an organism to signify an organismic trait. You can randomly shuffle and re-shuffle meaningless DNA configurations 'til the cows come home, but who cares?!? They do not make any difference.\n \n And finally, you want me to concede to your materialist assertion that 'anything is possible', because without that, your darwinist notion falls to pieces. But I refuse to say that, because it cannot be true in a rational universe, and so, if this universe is as rational as it appears to be, then it cannot be true here. That means that 'creatio ex nihilo' doesn't happen, and that that dictum applies always and everywhere, including in the domain of information. And since the genetic code correlates to information, the dictum applies to any information represented by DNA patterns. \n \n \n All that I have said so far that in any way pleases you is that any existing DNA configuration can be altered at random, be it a meaningless configuration or a meaningful one. You keep taking that simple fact and trying to build it into something that it is not. Mostly, you keep trying to say that any mutation in a DNA configuration equals an increase in information; that it accounts for the generation of novel information, i.e., origins. But this is not true. Wholly original DNA agglomerations do not generate novel information, simply because, in se, they have none to offer.\n \n And information encoded in established, meaningful genes [those already tied to traits] can only be changed, not created. And in a case where the original configuration already was encoded by the organism for a specific adaptive/productive trait, any change in the configuration can only result in a loss, never an increase, in the productive information it symbolized. That has to mean a damaged, less productive, less adaptive trait. That is, an inherited genetic defect.\n \n The utmost that can ever happen wrt adaptive traits and randomly generated genetic mutations is that a 'mutant' DNA configuration will physically mirror another meaningful and pre-existing DNA configuration. That kind of coincidence is irrelevent to evolution, so even though such an occurence is mathematically impossible in most case, i.e., in all but most basic, simplest 'point mutations', I'll let it go. \n \n You say that single-nucleotide swaps, aka, 'point mutations', do occur, and that when they occur they sometimes make informational changes that significantly effect the inheritance of established organismic traits. And I agree with this. But from that you wish to change the meaning of the accord from, 'affect the _inheritance_ of organismic traits', to 'affect the _evolution_ of organismic traits', something that I will not agree to. \n \n And so I say that randomly generated, very simple 'point mutations' can duplicate or fail to duplicate the information that is already there, in the organism, but they cannot create new, original information. To insist otherwise, as you do, is to say, with Dawkins et al, that DNA molecules and information, medium and message, are one and the same thing.\n \n A menu, [or a recipe, or a piece of paper, or a wall], is not an intelligent, volitional, self-directing 'anything'. It contains no information save what a trained intelligence can put into it and/or read from it. The same applies to writing such as '1/2 tsp salt'. That entity never originated by accident. Not even as a mere physical pattern, [it's too complex to be 'natural'], let alone as a symbolic construct representing a meaning. To say nothing of the fact that, out of context, it's meaningless anyway.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Pray tell, just how could such a scenario 'not matter' to a notion whose entire raison d'etre is the supposition that molecules determine traits?!? \n \n \n For the very simple reason we've chosen a variant gene that encapsulates all the novel information specific to that trait.\n\n \n **\n Meaning that you have stipulated both a pre-existing 'gene' and a pre-existing trait, since information about something entails that that something exists. You've 'begged the question'. That's not allowed.\n \n \n \n\n The developmental mechanism, however complex it may be, is not altered. The same chef, the same kitchen, the same raw materials - only the recipe is different. \n\n \n **\n Or so you assume. You seem to feel free to stipulate, arbitrarily, a scenario that 'a priori' reflects your notion of how nature works, and I'm supposed to just accept your rendition. For one thing, given the same 'chef', the recipe is irrelevent, because he doesn't need to look at it. Going back to the original 'take-out menu' scenario, either the selected dish is clear to him, or it will get sent back for clarification. If the customer 'ticked' the wrong 'box', and so gets the 'wrong' meal, well, that's their problem, their own fault, and it's only one anomalous case. If, in another scenario, the orders were communicated by pushing buttons, and those buttons were always breaking down, at random, so that many customers were repeatedly served what they hadn't ordered, then the store would soon be out of business. I.E., extinct.\n \n And in your 'menu' scenario, there is no analogy with 'creation/evolution', only with 'inheritance/reproduction/copying'. And I have said all along that inheritance can be altered by accident. I simply do not buy into your assumption that altered inheritance equals evolution.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n No DNA aggregation signifies any information but that which an organism with a a developed trait then informs it to signify. \n \n \n Once again, you claim that an altered recipe is meaningless and unintelligable unless the chef cooks the dish it describes first. This is clearly nonsense. A recipe can precede any attempt to cook it.\n\n \n **\n Now, that is _real_ nonsense. I don't know how many 'recipes' you have followed that refer to dishes that nobody has ever prepared, but I've never encountered such a thing. And even if, hypothetically, some chef simply writes out, speculatively, what he imagines might make a fine dish, he wouldn't just throw it together, randomly, but only on the basis of what he knows of such things. And in my experience, people who would follow such speculative recipes are asking for trouble. Most new recipes are created by chefs who adapt the dish as they create and cook it, by means of biofeedback [taste, smell, and taste again]. As a matter of fact, all good cooks do that even with tried and true recipes. No cook steps up to a spice rack blindfolded, or goes 'eeny meeny miney moh', when creating a recipe. No sane ones, at least.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n But all that reduced and/or distorted info can generate is a failed, partial trait, a genetic defect. \n \n \n Why? The exact same distortion to the information gives rise to a useful trait, according to you, provided the organism 'tests it out' first.\n\n \n **\n A \"useful trait\" requires specified information. \n But how can a trait be 'useful' unless it first exists, and correlates positively with something that is not itself? And how can there be any 'information' about it, and/or information about that positive correlation, unless that information exists in it, physically, or somewhere else, mentally? Since a trait is not the molecules of DNA that code for it, their physical existence does not entail its physical existence. And, since to my knowledge molecules have no imagination to speak of, the trait doesn't exist in them mentally, any more than it exists in them physically. Therefore a simple aggregation of DNA molecules has no entailed connection to any trait, useful or not, and cannot have such a connection, until _after_ that trait comes into existence, physically. \n The information about a trait cannot exist until after it does. Therefore a 'gene' that 'encodes' the trait's information cannot exist until after the trait does. \n \n Not unless you insist, on metaphysical grounds, that DNA molecules and the organismic traits they code for are the exact same things, in terms of information. And I think that that premise is what you are trying to prove wrt 'point mutations' in bacteria. But for myself, I still insist that 'the map is not the country'. Simply because in this universe, it seems to be a law that two separate entities, such as genes and traits, and their particular information content, cannot be the same; meaning truly, completely, identical.\n \n \n\n Sure, if the change is random rather than deliberate then it represents an untested trait, but why should it produce a different result when decoded?\n\n \n **\n Because there has to be 'a result' there to begin with, or else how can it be called, 'same' or 'different'? I've already said, a million times, that DNA can change all it likes, who cares? Only traits matter. It would seem to me that genetic mutations have no effect at all unless they alter the information encoded wrt a specified and existing trait, so as to alter that trait.\n \n And I've already said, just as many times, that if, by accident, some DNA comes together in an accidental pattern identical to some other DNA pattern that already codes for an existing trait, then it will probably have the same initial effect on the organism's development as the original 'gene', by sheer coincidence. But I insist, much to your chagrin, that an novel, accidental, spontaneous, agglomeration of DNA molecules in the genome does not, ipso facto, generate/determine a brand new trait, much less a novel trait that is 'useful' wrt some external variable. I keep talking about evolution, and you keep talking about replication.\n \n \n\n The only way two identical code sequences (genes) can be decoded into two different results (traits) is if two different decoders are used. But we've already excluded that possibility by selecting a variant gene which encapsulates all the novel information.\n\n \n **\n \"We\" didn't \"select\" anything. _You_ stipulated, hypothetically, a premise identical to your own conclusion. I granted that after a trait is informationally encoded into a group of nucleotides so as to create a 'gene', than an identical group of nucleotides would probably initiate the same developmental response as the original. But _you_ are the only one here who _assumes_, in this scenario, that a random agglomeration of DNA molecules _must_ generate a trait that has never been previously encoded, [because it has never previously existed]. You do that, over and over again, because you assume, metaphysically, that the 'information' that identifies the trait originates in the DNA molecules, [in fact, 'is' the DNA molecules], and not in the trait itself. That the molecules determine the conformation of the organism, rather than that the organism determines the conformation of the molecules. You can assume what you like, and I'll assume what I like.\n \n Quote:\n The fact that a genetic defect may prove useful to a few individuals on a few occasions means nothing, because anomalies and lucky exceptions to the general rule do not pass for evidence of 'mechanisms' in any science, except only in darwinism. See 'sickle-cell anaemia', for an example of this darwinist sophistry. \n \n \n Oh really?\n \n Sickle cell is an efficiency-harming mutation that happens to confer resistance to a particular environmental toxin, yes? It's possessed by a tiny minority of organisms except in areas where that toxin is endemic, yes?[/quote]\n \n **\n Sickle cell anaemia is a genetic disorder that is maladaptive in everyone who suffers from it, no matter where they live. In malaria-ridden populations it kills as many people as it supposedly 'saves' from the malaria parasite. Outside those areas it simply kills, or at least, badly debilitates. Therefore, considered as an organismic 'trait' in universal terms, it is maladaptive. If, in some situations, it proves anomalously adaptive, that is, some people have some resistance to the parasite, without the anaemia, that can hardly transform a trait which is generally maladaptive into an example of an 'adaptive' trait. Simply into a lucky exception. \n This should be especially true when considered from the 'darwinian' POV, which holds that evolution, and thus 'adaptation', applies at the general, populatiuon level, and not at the level of some exceptional individuals. But then, you guys change your tack according to the weather, and love using exceptions as evidence of support for your general rules.\n \n You have to, since, even after 150 years, those rare anomalies are all you've got.\n \n \n \n\n Now, let's look at antibiotic resistance. Small, single step mutation? Check. Efficiency-harming in the absence of antibiotic? Check. Possessed by a tiny minority? Check \n\n \n **\n Brand new mutation? Not. Regularly recurring? Check. Possessed by tiny minority of eusocial bacteria colonies? Not. Possessed by all, [even if not all the time], developed natural eubacteria colonies? Check.\n \n \n\n - indeed, a far, far, far tinier minority than possess sickle cell.\n\n \n **\n So now you figure that human individual populations and eubacteria cell populations are analogous? I don't. Last time I looked, we didn't have plasmids going for us, for one thing.\n \n \n\n Confers resistance to a particular environmental toxin? Check. Arises in a population at more or less identical rates as other random mutations occur within the genome? Check.\n\n \n **\n Unlike you, I do not confuse statistical correlation for biological causation.\n \n \n \n\n Doesn't seem to be all that much in it, does there?\n\n \n **\n Re your assumption of causation, you mean?

For me a meaningless agglomeration if nucleotides is just, 'data'; but an 'informed' arrangement of nucleotides that impacts an organism in terms of a trait, now that's a \"gene\", i.e., an information-bearing code. \n \n \n\n There's no issue to resolve here, no question to beg.\n\n \n **\n Not from my POV there isn't, I grant you.",

The change is occurring to a recipe that a developmental mechanism reads. And please, stop casting doubt on the occurrence of something you've already agreed happens.\n\n \n **\n I remember agreeing to accidental mechanical nucleotide dislocations altering any information previously encoded in a symbolic molecular structure, i.e', a 'gene'. You dreampt up a questionable analogy between 'genes' and distorted take-out menues, and when you got stuck there you switched to an 'accidentally altered' recipe. I've gone so far as to play along with your imaginative analogies. But I feel that some symbolic signs are more complex than others. Great Britain's Union Jack is several times more complex, hence far less like to arise by accident, then, say, the tri-colour of France. To me that same comparison of simplicity vs complexity, and with it ease or difficulty of accidental formation, can also apply to letters and numerals. A \"1\", for instance, could be physically constructed, quite accidentally, with ease. A \"5\", not so much. But this is a side issue, merely a quibble re your analogy of 'genes' with artificial human communication system symbology.\n \n Getting back to the chef/recipe analogy, if the 'chef' is an unskilled labourer hired an hour earlier as a short-order cook, then maybe he'll need to reed a recipe, and will follow it like a robot, an automaton, because that is all he is able to do. Things are getting more and more far-fetched, but since your contention is that organism's are in fact no more dynamic than an ignorant automaton of a short-order cook, and that they must mindlessly follow 'genetic directions', no matter what they are, just like your imaginary chef, I can see why you would insist on the plausibility of your rather implausible imaginary scenario.\n \n But coming back to it. A changed recipe is not a novel recipe, even if it is novel to the cook. A recipe that is 'new to you' is not new recipe to the world, and is certainly not a recipe that suddenly popped out of nothing and nowhere to present itself , de novo, to you first.\n \n An altered recipe is a partial change, not a total one. If a 'gene' change totally changes a trait, then it is an entirely different recipe, not just an altered one. Your whole argument for the past months has involved 'point mutations' mostly occuring in the anomalous circimstance of eubacteria plasmids, as examples of where a simple alteration in a 'gene' creates a totally different 'dish', i.e., 'trait'. That is, by your analogy, where a simple mechanical dislocation does not merely alter a given recipe for a certain dish, but in effect writes a whole other recipe for a whole other dish.\n \n I have no objection to the analogy where a simple accidental change alters an outcome, partially. Be it a recipe or a gene. I do object when you assert that an accidental, partial change in a 'gene' or a 'recipe' can increase, rather than decrease its productive info. Why? Because the info would not exist if it did not serve a productive purpose, that being a desired/optimal end product. Any accidental change must therefore take away from the successful production of the desired end product, because, being accidental, it is not correlated with that product.\n If you change the salt content, you do not totally switch dishes, but you do change what was, when written, considered to be the 'optimal' outcome, the most suitable flavour. If you change the salt content randomly, without any regard for the flavour of the finished dish, you're not a chef, or any kind of cook, but you are a perfect analogy wrt a random 'point mutation', or a baboon in a bakery.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Meaning that you have stipulated both a pre-existing 'gene' and a pre-existing trait, since information about something entails that that something exists. \n \n \n \n Information about how to make something can easily exist before the thing it describes.\n\n \n **\n Not true. Why are you deliberately ignoring my clear reference to physical and mental pre-existence? An engineer can describe how to build an object that he has already imagined, because, mentally, that object exists before he tells others how to make it. As I pointed out in my last post, DNA molecules are not noted for their powers of creative imagination. Therefore, genetically speaking, objects/traits cannot pre-exist, mentally, the way that human artefacts can do. They must actually exist, physically, before the information on what they are, i.e., their existence, and how they are to be constructed, i.e., brought into existence, can exist. And thereafter be encoded elsewhere, symbolically, outside of their actual 'selves'.\n Unless you see the genome as a clever little gnome with a great imagination and a flair for engineering?!? \n \n \n\n It's easy: you just follow the amended instructions and see what happens. I'll give you a hint: you'll get the same result as if someone had deliberately amended those same instructions in the same way, and the same result as if someone had amended those instructions in the same way after testing the design first.\n\n \n **\n Ho hum. Are you really unable to see the difference between 'original' and 'new to you'? I'll give you a hint. You cannot \"amend instructions\" unless those instructions already exist. If those instructions already exist, then their end-product must also exist, either mentally, imaginatively, hypothetically,-- or just plain physically. Since pre-existance by imagination only applies to human mental processes, and since DNA nucleotides don't have minds and imaginations, they cannot contain novel, original information for constructing something that simply does not yet physically exist.\n \n The only way that 'genes' could 'pre-exist' the trait they 'code for', as I have repeated 1,000 times, would be if they did not 'code' information, nor act in any 'symbolic' fashion, but quite simply were nothing more than chemicals capable of directly, linearly transforming themselves, by pure physical mechanics, from a collection of acid molecules into a cellular organismic trait.\n That is what 'genetic determinism' entails.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n For one thing, given the same 'chef', the recipe is irrelevent, because he doesn't need to look at it. \n \n \n Then why is the gene being written out at all? If you say 'for posterity', then presumably it's because the offspring of the bacterium, the 'chef's son' needs it to refer to, yes? Well, most random mutations occur during cell division, so it's the son who, quite unawares, is getting the altered gene. And he does need to look at it.\n\n \n **\n Fair ball, but it only points out the weakness in your analogy. IAC, I've said all along that accidental mutations that alter established genetic instructions do happen. In fact, bacteria cells have 'repair mechanisms', [see SOS response]for this very contingency-- the \"chef's son\" is not an automaton. But what I have said, ad nauseum, is that accidentally altered genes never increase an organism's productivity and adaptedness. You assume that they can and do, but an assumption is not a fact.\n \n \n\n Or we can cut it out and put it in a completely different organism, and it will look at it, and produce the same trait.

   "It's extremely easy to explain. It goes like this. All of the above is your fantasy, a fiction in which events play out as you would have them play out.\n End of explanation.\n\n \n Clearly I'm not managing to communicate the thrust of my argument, if you are prepared to classify a sequence of events that obey your metaphysic as 'fantasy'. :)\n \n I can only apologise. With your permission I'll go back and take things step by step, referring to relevant points you've made along the way.\n \n You've said all along that the origin of a trait is not the same, metaphysically, as the inheritance or transferral of that trait. Which is true, of course; I have no argument with that.\n \n However, if we examine the sequence of events as they occur according to your conjecture:\n \n Organismic response-<encode trait in a variant gene-<inheritance-<decoding of gene-<re-expression of trait\n \n we notice that the variant gene in question can and does occur as a result of random mutations, and you've agreed this can happen before any organism has ever 'encoded' a trait in that form. In other words, it's possible for the origin of a novel gene to masquerade as inheritance of that gene. Our only point of disagreement is in our prediction of what would happen next in such an eventuality.\n \n My prediction is that the inheritor of the altered gene, since it is receiving exactly the same data it would have inherited were the gene an 'intentional encoding', will follow the same instructions, with the same result, as if it were inheriting it from a parent. It has no way of knowing that it is the first to 'try out' those instructions.\n \n Your prediction, on the other hand, is that nothing will happen. For that to be the case, something must be missing; the inheritor must be lacking something it 'would have got' from a parent which had deliberately encoded the trait.\n \n At the core of the issue, therefore, is exactly what is encoded in a variant gene that correlates it with a novel organismic trait. Earlier I offered three options which I believe span the gamut of hypothetical possibility:\n \n a) The altered gene indexes the novel trait. It tells the organism which trait to express, but contains no information about the trait itself.\n \n b) The altered gene contains some novel information about the trait: 'instructions' for what the developmental apparatus should do in order for that trait to be expressed, but there are also trait-specific alterations to the developmental apparatus itself that make those instructions legible.\n \n c) The altered gene contains all the novel information about the trait: the pre-existing developmental apparatus need only follow the 'altered instructions' and the trait will be expressed.\n \n My objective is to logically show that at least some of the time, mutations fall into category c), because in such cases random mutation would successfully masquerade as the inheritance of a previously 'encoded' trait, even if no such trait had ever existed in the past. \n \n Do you agree with this reasoning?\n \n \n Meanwhile, some of the other objections you raised:\n \n \nGetting back to the chef/recipe analogy, if the 'chef' is an unskilled labourer hired an hour earlier as a short-order cook, then maybe he'll need to reed a recipe, and will follow it like a robot, an automaton, because that is all he is able to do.\n\n \n Evidence points to this being an accurate characterisation of the process, again at least some of the time:\n \n 1) The fact DNA exists, is passed down, and is according to you used to encode trait information indicates that the instructions it contains are referred to, 'believed', and acted upon by the organism's developmental apparatus.\n \n 2) Excision or transplanting of a gene results in the excision or transplanting of associated traits in subsequent generations, indicating that the 'chef's son' does refer to the written recipes and has no other way of inheriting what they contain. Other inheritance pathways may exist and convey other information, but the genetic pathway is not redundant.\n \n 3) Although genes can be conditionally activated and deactivated during development, there is no evidence that an altered gene can conditionally express its pre- and post-mutation functions. If expressed, the altered gene will give rise to the novel trait in that organism.\n \n \nI have no objection to the analogy where a simple accidental change alters an outcome, partially. Be it a recipe or a gene. I do object when you assert that an accidental, partial change in a 'gene' or a 'recipe' can increase, rather than decrease its productive info. Why? Because the info would not exist if it did not serve a productive purpose, that being a desired/optimal end product.\n\n \n But it's fallacious to assume the current product is optimal, especially when 'optimal' is relative to an environment which is subject to change. If the gene's end product is merely 'good' and not 'perfect', then a change to the gene can make it better. If it's close to perfection then most random changes will make it worse, but so long as it's possible for that gene to do a better job by being slightly differerent, then it's possible for RM to hit upon that particular slight difference. Unlikely, sure, but possible, and our empirical tests clearly show us that these anomalous 'improvements' occur very, very rarely - as rarely as we would expect from RM - and are only made statistically 'regular' by the vast quantities of bacteria involved.\n \n \nAny accidental change must therefore take away from the successful production of the desired end product, because, being accidental, it is not correlated with that product.\n\n \n Certainly it will detract from the production of the end product in the precise form it used to take, but there's nothing saying the new product can't be more useful than the old, either in the same circumstances or in ones later experienced. Sure, if the old product is very, very good then a random change isn't likely to make it better, but we don't observe 'likely' improvements, we observe very, very rare anomalous ones.\n \n \nIf you change the salt content, you do not totally switch dishes, but you do change what was, when written, considered to be the 'optimal' outcome, the most suitable flavour.\n\n \n Again you're assuming an infallible, perfect chef whose recipes are flawless. But according to you, organisms are not perfect; they follow a 'heuristic' that involves random elements, and the contents of their genes are just the 'best so far'. Hence there is room for improvement.\n \n \nIf you change the salt content randomly, without any regard for the flavour of the finished dish, you're not a chef, or any kind of cook, but you are a perfect analogy wrt a random 'point mutation'.\n\n \n Nonetheless, if a less salty dish is more palatable to the current clientel, and I randomly happen to put less salt in, the dish will still taste better. Try as you might, you've made no headway toward disproving that.\n \n \nNot true. Why are you deliberately ignoring my clear reference to physical and mental pre-existence? An engineer can describe how to build an object that he has already imagined, because, mentally, that object exists before he tells others how to make it.\n\n \n I'm not ignoring it. I'm merely pointing out that an alteration to a set of engineering instructions will have the same result regardless of whether anyone has imagined or built an object with that variation. Sure, an engineer can imagine those changes first, or test them out. Does that change what you get when you follow the instructions? No.\n \n \nThe only way that 'genes' could 'pre-exist' the trait they 'code for', as I have repeated 1,000 times, would be if they did not 'code' information, nor act in any 'symbolic' fashion, but quite simply were nothing more than chemicals capable of directly, linearly transforming themselves, by pure physical mechanics, from a collection of acid molecules into a cellular organismic trait.\n That is what 'genetic determinism' entails.\n\n \n You have repeated that 1000 times, and it hasn't got any more true in the retelling :) No matter how abstract the symbolism, no matter how complex the decoding process, a random change to the 'instructions' will have the exact same effect as an identical purposeful change to those instructions would have, even if that change has never occurred before.\n \n \nFair ball,\n\n \n Thanks :)\n \n \nBut what I have said, ad nauseum, is that accidentally altered genes never increase an organism's productivity and adaptedness. You assume that they can and do, but an assumption is not a fact.\n\n \n You see, this is where your reasoning falls down. On the one hand you say accidentally altered genes never increase an organism's productivity and adaptedness, yet on the other you accept that RM can exactly mimic changes to genes that do increase an organism's productivity and adaptedness. Not only that, but you agree those changes can occur first via RM. You've agreed with everything logically necessary for accidentally altered genes to improve an organism's adaptedness, but you simply refuse to accept where logic is taking you. Instead you stonewall behind an axiom whose applicability you've never satisfactorily justified.\n \n And you keep using the word 'never', and then talking about 'exceptions to the general rule' like sickle cell. An axiomatic universal principle is a universal principle; never means never. One hole and it comes crashing down.\n \n \nYou honestly believe that someone just 'made up' and presented on TV what looked like a 'plausible' list of ingredients for a recipe for a dish that had never yet been actually been prepared and eaten?!?! What a cynical attitude to have toward TV chefs!!\n\n \n My bad for not explaining this better. \n \n I noted down the recipe on a scrap of paper, but I noted it down wrongly. I was therefore (as far as I know) the first person ever to cook that dish that way. After I'd cooked and eaten the novel dish, I wrote down the recipe again in my recipe book (ie, encoded a dish that now had existed).\n \n The moral of the story is that an accidental change will give rise to the exact same effect as an identical, purposeful change. Since you accept that accidental changes can mimic purposeful changes, and you accept they can happen first, the logic is inescapable: accidental changes can be responsible for originating traits.\n \n \nOh, please, antibiotic resistance in eubacteria colonies and sickle-cell anaemia in human beings are no more analogous than chalk and cheese.\n\n \n Please, explain why they are not analogous in effect. Don't say 'because resistance is a deliberate eusocial response,' because that's the conjecture you're trying to prove. Show me some evidence that it is what you say it is. The 'regularity' with which it occurs doesn't count, because it's exactly the same regularity we would expect from random mutations in a multi-billion-strong colony.",

Its the same principle that Lysenko put into large scale practice and nearly starved the soviet union, while in contrast plant breeders following Darwinian theories improved yields in the West by an order of magnitude. Best test of the two concepts yet done on a practical level. Lysenkos plants failed to adapt \"intelligently\". The western breeders searching out random mutations and selecting them achieved massive changes in traits.\n \n Take your pick of which type of theory works best, and be prepared for real world consequences if you are wrong! Also note well that you cannot prepare any recipe at all if you cannot come up with the ingredients because your country followed the Lysenko path. Oh well there is always bone soup prepared from those who died of starvation.",

   "Just a quick additional note, regarding the 'assumptions' WW insists I am making:\n \n Anyone familiar with the formulation of mathematical proofs will know that one commonly used strategy is to assert, or assume, the contrapositive and see whether it leads to a contradiction. My personal favourite example is the proof that the square root of 2 is irrational:\n \n Assume root(2) is rational, so it can be written as A/B where A and B are integers with no common factor (ie, they're the smallest numbers we can use). \n \n Root(2) = A/B means 2 = AA/BB and so 2BB = AA. That means AA is an even number, and so A must also be an even number. Let A = 2C. So 2BB=AA=4CC. Therefore BB=2CC, so BB is even, so B is even. Let B = 2D. Now Root(2) = A/B = 2C/2D. However, we specified A and B should be the smallest possible integers, with no common factors. We have just contradicted ourselves, and thus we prove that Root(2) is irrational.\n \n I never get tired of that one :)\n \n Anyway, the point is that in our consideration of whether random mutation can hit upon improvements to a complex biological system, we don't need to assume they can. We can instead assume they can't, and see where logic takes us. Well, strictly speaking we're no longer talking about whether RM can hit upon an improvement as such, only about whether RM can hit upon a novel improvement:\n \n Assume RM cannot be responsible for the origin of a novel improvement.\n \n We've established that this translates to the following real-world 'rules':\n \n 1. RM can mimic the genes which (according to EAM) are used by the organism to 'encode' traits, and this can happen first, before the putative 'encoding' is ever performed.\n \n 2. According to EAM, once the encoding has been performed, RM-induced inheritance of the variant gene results in the expression of the trait.\n \n 3. According to EAM, RM-induced inheritance of the same gene will have no effect prior to the putative 'first encoding'.\n \n If these three rules are true, we can logically derive a fourth: \n \n 4.Therefore Some data or instructions concerning the novel trait must be passed from parent to offspring outside the gene.\n \n If this were not the case, then RM-induced inheritance of the variant gene would provide the offspring with precisely the same data and instructions it would inherit from a parent which had deliberately encoded the gene. In other words, RM-inheritance would have successfully masqueraded as inheritance of a pre-existing, encoded trait, and our assumption that RM can't induce novel traits would be violated.\n \n So the validity of our assumption rests upon one single foundation stone: that other information outside the gene in question must be required for the trait to be expressed.\n \n How can we test the solidity of that foundation stone? By transplanting the gene, and only the gene, into another organism - a different species, even - and observing whether the trait is expressed.\n \n Previously, WW, you've said that this test is irrelevant because we're deliberately transplanting an 'intentionally encoded' gene. However, that argument relies upon the gene containing everything that is necessary to describe the trait, an assumption which directly contradicts 4.\n \n You can't have it both ways. If gene splicing works because that specific genetic sequence describes all the necessary data and instructions, then RM-inheritance of that genetic sequence will likewise provide all the necessary data and instructions, regardless of whether the trait is novel or not. On the other hand, if the gene is not enough on its own, then gene splicing shouldn't work - but it empirically does.\n \n Any way you look at it, the assumption that RM cannot induce a novel trait leads to a contradiction.",

Anyhoo, I'll try to catch up a little before you get to far along.\n \n \n\n You've said all along that the origin of a trait is not the same, metaphysically, as the inheritance or transferral of that trait. Which is true, of course; I have no argument with that.\n \n However, if we examine the sequence of events as they occur according to your conjecture:\n \n Organismic response-<encode trait in a variant gene-<inheritance-<decoding of gene-<re-expression of trait\n \n we notice that the variant gene in question can and does occur as a result of random mutations, and you've agreed this can happen before any organism has ever 'encoded' a trait in that form. \n\n \n **\n As I've repeatedly pointed out to you, our disagreement seems to stem from radically different concepts of just what defines a \"gene\". You seem quite satisfied with the definition of a a \"gene\" as being any and all agglomerations of physically linked [sequential]DNA molecules. My definition of a \"gene\", OTH, is any sequence of DNA molecules that encodes information wrt a specified organismic trait. It's like the difference between meaningless brute facts, aka, \"data\", and the meaning, significance, the 'information' that arises out of the relationship between different 'data'. That means that no simple 'sequence' of DNA molecules can be called a \"gene\", in se. To be a \"gene\" such molecular combos must be significantly, meaningfully, correlated to a particular organismic trait. And they cannot do that, until after the trait exists. That means that the trait must pre-exist the \"gene\" that codes for it. Now it may be that a particular molecular sequence can pre-exist a trait, but in that case it is not a \"gene\" for that trait, simply because that trait does not exist. AFAIAC, such meaningless \"proto-\" or \"pseudo\" \"genes\" can form and reform as much as you like, as often as you like, thanks to any old 'random' cause you like. It doesn't mean a thing.\n \n As I said before, you mistakenly [IMHO] believe that it does mean something. You believe this because, as a materialist/mechanist, you are a physical determinist, and as such, you believe that any and all changes to the way in which DNA molecules happen to align with one another MUST, always and everywhere, everytime, lead inevitably to some kind of expression as a corresponding organismic trait change, and when there is no already established trait there to be altered, then that DNA alteration must, by and of itself, generate and determine a truly novel organismic trait, while to organism passively allows itself, its complement of traits, to be added to or subtracted from, according to the dictates of this accidental molecular reformation. Unless you do believe in exactly this scenario, then your whole fisherian edifice of neo-darwinism must come tumbling down in smoke and ash.\n \n \n \n\n In other words, it's possible for the origin of a novel gene to masquerade as inheritance of that gene. Our only point of disagreement is in our prediction of what would happen next in such an eventuality.\n\n \n **\n As above, no, it is not. What is possible, is that a meaningless agglomeration of DNA molecules can \"masquerade\" for a \"gene\" that does not exist, that has yet to \"originate\". Our real disagreement is, as above, our different understandings of what makes a \"gene\" a \"gene\", and not just 'bits of stuff'.\n \n \n \n\n My prediction is that the inheritor of the altered gene, since it is receiving exactly the same data it would have inherited were the gene an 'intentional encoding', will follow the same instructions, with the same result, as if it were inheriting it from a parent. It has no way of knowing that it is the first to 'try out' those instructions.\n\n \n **\n To repeat yet again, there is the origin of a _novel_ 'gene', which must [as above] take place _after_ the origin of a _novel_ trait, [this is called, 'evolution'], and then their is the reproduction/replication of an established gene which precedes the _development_ of an established trait.[this is called, 'heredity']. The grossest error in the last 200 years of science has been the neo-darwinian confusion and conflation of evolution with heredity, two very different, indeed, conflicting, organismic mechanisms.\n \n Taking careful note of the difference between origins and replication, it may be allowed that a randomly formed agglomeration of DNA molecules that accidentally replicates the molecular conformation of an established, inherited gene, may, in fact, should, lead to the same established, inherited or heritable trait as thep-re-existing, non-random 'gene' that it mimics.\n \n Now, it seems to me that unless and until we can decide, unequivocally, once and for all, on whose definition of a \"gene\" , yours or mine, most closely maps to reality as empirically observed and rationally interpreted, we will get nowhere in this debate. And since the fisherian model of \"genetic\" evolution is the established assumption, and has been for 80 years, I think that the onus is on you to show that yours is indeed a valid assumption. That is, that all and any novel DNA agglomerations MUST, by mechanical determinism, result in _novel_ organimic trait appearance [i.e., 'origins', 'evolution'].",

Well, strictly speaking we're no longer talking about whether RM can hit upon an improvement as such, only about whether RM can hit upon a novel improvement:\n\n \n I understand what you are saying here, but there is a major problem namely that the term \"novel improvement\" is very very very vague. WW will simply look at any specific example and say - \"Thats not a novel improvement\" and off he will go hopping smugly over the cliff of egotistical certainty yet again.\n \n \nAssume RM cannot be responsible for the origin of a novel improvement.\n\n \n Thats certainly consistent with our resident Lagomorph. You are on his page.\n \n \nWe've established that this translates to the following real-world 'rules':\n\n \n You will now be stepping on rabbit pellets with bare feet I suspect.\n \n \n1. RM can mimic the genes which (according to EAM) are used by the organism to 'encode' traits, and this can happen first, before the putative 'encoding' is ever performed.\n\n \n There is no reason in principle to deny that, but somehow......\n \n \n2. According to EAM, once the encoding has been performed, RM-induced inheritance of the variant gene results in the expression of the trait.\n \n\n \n Straight from the Lagomorphs mandibles and I think {although its difficult to penetrate his verbal smokescreen} thats what he has admitted to explicitly.\n \n \n3. According to EAM, RM-induced inheritance of the same gene will have no effect prior to the putative 'first encoding'.\n \n\n \n Well it could not be consistent if it was anyother way, but isn't that just a patch to the theory- something added as an afterthought to preserve it against a well placed criticism? And I will assume that EAM = WW in regard to this rule. I have no access to a formal written EAM document.\n \n \nIf these three rules are true, we can logically derive a fourth: \n \n 4.Therefore Some data or instructions concerning the novel trait must be passed from parent to offspring outside the gene.\n\n \n I would simplify that one a bit and just say extra-genetic information or even exo-genetic information must be passed.\n \n \nIf this were not the case, then RM-induced inheritance of the variant gene would provide the offspring with precisely the same data and instructions it would inherit from a parent which had deliberately encoded the gene. \n\n \n Yes thats logical and necessary else the expression of the RM improvement would appear immediately in single celled organisms. In sexual reproducing organisms of course a RM {to a sex cell or progenitor} could only appear in the next generation. If one of your sperm has an RM event, your phenotype will not change. Not so with single celled organisms of course.\n \n \nIn other words, RM-inheritance would have successfully masqueraded as inheritance of a pre-existing, encoded trait, and our assumption that RM can't induce novel traits would be violated.\n \n\n \n Indeed.\n \n \nSo the validity of our assumption rests upon one single foundation stone: that other information outside the gene in question must be required for the trait to be expressed.\n\n \n And that information must be able to suppress the immediate operation of the RM.\n \n \nHow can we test the solidity of that foundation stone? By transplanting the gene, and only the gene, into another organism - a different species, even - and observing whether the trait is expressed.\n\n \n Unfortunately thats not an experiment we can actually do with any precision emoticon_cry I think you will find that you would have to transplant the RM without any duplication of it - duplication allows the \"encoding\" to take over does it not? Genetic engineering is a very powerful tool but we cannot SFAIK pick up a single newly made RM and move it to another species without a LOT of manipulation and amplification!! It would be nice if we could, and maybe you know how to do it but I don't think its technically practical as of yet. It works as a gedanken experiment but not in the lab.\n \n Previously, WW, you've said that this test is irrelevant because we're deliberately transplanting an 'intentionally encoded' gene. However, that argument relies upon the gene containing everything that is necessary to describe the trait, an assumption which directly contradicts 4.\n \n You can't have it both ways.

On the other hand, if the gene is not enough on its own, then gene splicing shouldn't work - but it empirically does.\n\n \n Yes gene splicing does work, but WW still has the out that gene splicing is not done with a newly minted RM which has never been replicated! Sorry bout that, I just don't think you quite get from where you started to the real world.\n \n \nAny way you look at it, the assumption that RM cannot induce a novel trait leads to a contradiction.\n\n \n With this I agree, but for empirical reasons not philosophical ones. We know where the information encoded in the genes comes from and we know how it gets there and its not by intelligence its a random statistical process which occurrs in intelligent and non-intelligent organisms with equal facility. In addition traits are the effects of genes not their cause except by the indirect feedback provided by natural selection. In the EAM concept the environment causes the trait and the trait then causes the gene which in all future generations causes the trait! WWs scientific problem (not philosophical - scientific) is to identify a physical mechanism by which the \"intelligence\" caused trait can cause an alteration of a gene which wil be inherited. In other words he will have to FIND the \"intelligence\" mechanism somehow rather than just assuming it. His problem is that he faces an alternative theory (RM-NS) which provides the complete chain of causation. RM is caused by natural processes based in chemistry and it involves identifiable measurable alterations of a specific structure. That structure (DNA) produces by templating RNA which in turn either serves direct regulatory/structural roles or it provides the template for protein sysnthesis mediated by tRNA templates which translate triplets of mRNA to specific aminoacids which are assembled sequentially by ribosomes which \"read\" the templating mRNA and form peptide bonds in a tightly controlled chemical process. The various RNA transcripts, and the proteins in turn interact in complex ways (biological networks) which are still being elucidated to control both the development and the day to day operation of the organism via biochemical means. Subsequent generations of the same linage will (barring additional mutation events) inherit the RM and preserve the information PROVIDED that they survive and reproduce and the relative survival and reproduction of the various linages in the biosphere (in aggregate fitness) provides a filter which favors some linages above others and over time results in changes in traits observed in diverse life forms.\n \n EAM uses much of that, but it invokes an unknown and undemonstrated linkage between the environment and the genes mediated by \"intelligence\" rather than Natural Selection. EAM is to a large degree just NDS with the word \"intelligence\" replacing the words \"natural selection\" along with an inversion of a couple of cause effect relationships.",

And they cannot do that, until after the trait exists.\n \n \n Invalid reasoning. You make the unwarrented assumption that the trait is the independent variable in the correlation rather than the dependent one. You invert cause and effect which is the key error in your overall hypothesis in general. In the SCT example the gene sequence CAUSES the SC-hemoglobin not the other way round. Introducing SC-hemoglobin containing RBCs into a human will not alter that persons genes. Altering the relevant gene in a person will cause SC-hemoblobin.\n \n \nThat means that the trait must pre-exist the \"gene\" that codes for it. \n\n \n If it were true yes. But its not true! SC-Hemoglobin does not pre-exist before its gene - indeed you can trace the entire causal reltionship biochemically from gene to SC-heme.\n \n \nNow it may be that a particular molecular sequence can pre-exist a trait, but in that case it is not a \"gene\" for that trait, simply because that trait does not exist. \n\n \n The cause of the trait must necessarily pre-exist the trait itself. This is basic to the principles of causation. The gene (if it is to be a cause) MUST exist before the trait (the effect) appears. All you have done is to introduce a SECOND and independent CAUSE which you label as \"intelligence\". The operation of that cause creates the trait which then causes the gene which subsequently cause the trait.

It doesn't mean a thing.\n\n \n Actually thats not the case in your theory since after the creation of the trait the genes then have to take up the role of causation rather than \"intelligence\". If what you say above applies then the genes serve absolutely no purpose and the causation and maintainence of traits has to ride entirely upon intelligence as a cause.

Some information is missing.\n \n \n So, let's go back to your assertion that DNA sequences mean nothing unless they '[encode] information wrt a specified organismic trait', and that nothing will happen if RM causes an organism to inherit a physically identical gene prior to that 'encoding' taking place. \n \n For this to be true, the gene would have to be a message akin to the latter example above: a novel message that is meaningless to the organism unless it is also privy to other trait-specific novel information, presumably inherited via some other mechanism. \n \n There's nothing metaphysical about this, no ethereal 'information aura' missing from the RM-induced gene - it's just that part of the information required for the trait to be expressed is absent, both from the gene and the organism inheriting it.\n \n \n Ok. Now we come to your explanation for why gene-splicing works: you say that we are transferring an allele that was used to deliberately encode a trait. But we are transferring it to an organism that cannot have received any other trait-specific information via any other inheritance pathway, because it can be completely unrelated to the donor organism. Therefore, the allele must be a message akin to the former example, containing instructions and data that the recipient organism's existing developmental apparatus can make sense of.\n \n Thus we have a contradiction. If gene+unmodified developmental apparatus = trait, then the recipient organism would 'make the same sense' of that allele even if it obtained it via RM. The fact that it would contain altered instructions or data describing a variant trait that has never existed before is irrelevant: nothing would be missing. Nothing would or could prevent the organism from expressing the novel, untested trait, just as if it had inherited it or had it spliced into its genome.\n \n In short, your objections to RM inducing novel traits melt away when we actually nail down what you mean by information being 'wrt a specified trait'. If no trait-specific information is passed down outside the gene, the encoded data isn't - can't be - 'wrt' anything except the existing developmental apparatus. And if RM creates that data - even if it's never existed before - the trait will emerge because nothing is missing.",

Our debate revolves arounf the question of whether or not a collection of nucleotides constitutes a 'gene' when that collection carries no information content that can be 'decoded' by an organism, or even more to the point, whether or not it is possible to have a collection of nucleotides/DNA molecules that do not, by their very existence alone, encode information that can be decoded by an organism.\n \n At this stage in the debate I do not believe that, as you believe, that the mere existence of conjoined DNA molecules/nucleotides, whatever, by the mere fact of their existence, encode information that can be decoded by a developing organism into an organismic trait.

Some information is missing.\n \n \n So, let's go back to your assertion that DNA sequences mean nothing unless they '[encode] information wrt a specified organismic trait', and that nothing will happen if RM causes an organism to inherit a physically identical gene prior to that 'encoding' taking place. \n \n For this to be true, the gene would have to be a message akin to the latter example above: a novel message that is meaningless to the organism unless it is also privy to other trait-specific novel information, presumably inherited via some other mechanism. \n\n \n **\n What you are doing is examining the mechanism of inheritance, in which you assume that every novel trait is just an old trait, but with a piece of old information missing, and not replaced with new and original information. This is the basic metaphysical assumption upon which fisherism, aka, NDT, aka 'the modern synthesis', is founded. It works nicely for heredity, in which traits get redistributed over time, some more, some less, but it does not, because it cannot, account for evolution, aka, 'origins'. The appearance of a novel trait that is not just a simple 'variation' of an old trait. Whether a trait is only slightly different from anyrhing that ever preceded it, or is tremendously different from anything that preceded it, is only a quantitative judge. Great or small, if it is totally novel, your theory of original traits arising from ' information subtracted by random accident from the genetic code' just won't cover the bases, and you're left appealing to 'emergence', 'spontaneous generation', 'random' information writing[RM], or some other variation on the theme, \"it just, 'happens', that's all!\".\n \n \n\n There's nothing metaphysical about this, no ethereal 'information aura' missing from the RM-induced gene - it's just that part of the information required for the trait to be expressed is absent, both from the gene and the organism inheriting it.\n\n \n **\n Which simply means that that trait cannot and will not be expressed, as the inheritance mechanism had intended.\n \n \n\n Ok. Now we come to your explanation for why gene-splicing works: you say that we are transferring an allele that was used to deliberately encode a trait. But we are transferring it to an organism that cannot have received any other trait-specific information via any other inheritance pathway, because it can be completely unrelated to the donor organism. \n\n \n **\n Hold on thar, pardner. I'm no genetic engineer, not by a long chalk, but from what I hear, this gene-splicing thingy is not the simple, straightforward mechanical insertion process that you are trying to spin it as being.\n \n I don't accuse you of being deliberately deceptive, but I do not for one moment believe that GM engineers can take a gene that 'codes' for, say, 'spider silk', and simply insert it into a beetle, say, and so get a novel species of beetle that now spins 'spider silk'; something different from what any beetle had ever done before.\n \n I think 'gene-splicing' only ever 'works' where a 'spliced gene' 'fits in with' the genetic composition/traits of the receiver organism, that is, via a similar information pathway in both donor and receiver organisms-- usually one that the engineers doing the transplant have to devote much time, effort, and intelligence in finding and exploiting.\n \n Now, 'gene-splicing' may be a great deal simpler for simple organisms that have plasmid mechanisms for LGT and so forth, and which are already so similar that novel gene expression pathways are pretty much a matter of course, but in complex organisms, that is, the plants and animals all around us, your entire set of GMO assumptions are very much in doubt. And may be extremely dangerous mistakes.\n \n \n\n Therefore, the allele must be a message akin to the former example, containing instructions and data that the recipient organism's existing developmental apparatus can make sense of.\n\n \n **\n Well, some kind of 'sense', anyway, even if not the intended sense.\n \n \n\n Thus we have a contradiction. If gene+unmodified developmental apparatus = trait, then the recipient organism would 'make the same sense' of that allele even if it obtained it via RM.\n\n \n **\n Basically what you are saying is that if the receiver organism already possessed the same trait development pathway as the donor organism, than it would use that pathway to develop the donated gene into the same trait it coded for in the donor. But why would the trait development pathway [i.e., the mechanical chemical developmental process--assuming that the process is simply mechanical, chemical, and hence, determined] be divorced from the gene and the trait it codes for, in either donor or receiver?\n \n \n \n\n The fact that it would contain altered instructions or data describing a variant trait that has never existed before is irrelevant:\n\n \n \n **\n Hold on again. It does not code for a trait that has never existed, it only codes for a trait that never existed 'here'. That is, for example, 'spider silk' that never before came out of beetles. If you inserted a 'gene' of never been seen organismic properties into a beetle, and then, lo and behold, you then got beetles that shot sticky fibres out of their mouths or rear ends in order to capture prey, then that would be original.\n \n And the difference between these two kinds of phenomena is relevent.\n \n \n \n\n In short, your objections to RM inducing novel traits melt away when we actually nail down what you mean by information being 'wrt a specified trait'. If no trait-specific information is passed down outside the gene, the encoded data isn't - can't be - 'wrt' anything except the existing developmental apparatus. And if RM creates that data - even if it's never existed before - the trait will emerge because nothing is missing.\n\n \n **\n Now all you need are some facts to back up your speculation. Particularly the assumption that \"no trait-specific information is passed down outside the gene\". \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

New and original data is quite welcome. \n \n The point is that if all the novel information is encoded within the gene, and none is inherited by other mechanisms, then RM's accidental creation of that variant gene will inevitably result in the offspring decoding and expressing the same trait it would exhibit if it received the same gene from a parent that had used it to encode that trait in the first place.\n \n \nWhich simply means that that trait cannot and will not be expressed, as the inheritance mechanism had intended.\n\n \n Exactly the point.

But why would the trait development pathway [i.e., the mechanical chemical developmental process--assuming that the process is simply mechanical, chemical, and hence, determined] be divorced from the gene and the trait it codes for, in either donor or receiver?\n\n \n Because such pathways can be general purpose, transcribing DNA to mRNA and on to form proteins etc. You don't (always) need a new computer to run a new piece of software, and similarly you don't (always) need a new developmental pathway to process a gene.\n \n \nHold on again. It does not code for a trait that has never existed, it only codes for a trait that never existed 'here'. \n\n \n True, but what I'm asking you to think about is this: is it possible for the organism receiving the gene, be it via transplant or RM, to know that?\n \n If not, then 'new here' is as far as the organism is concerned indistinguishable from 'genuinely new'. And therefore if a 'new here' gene can result in the trait being expressed, then it could have resulted in the same trait even if it was 'genuinely new'. In other words, RM could have been the ultimate origin of that gene and that trait.\n \n If you get handed a recipe, you've no idea whether it's ever been cooked before. Oh, you can surmise that it's likely, but you can't be sure your copy doesn't have a typesetting error that makes it genuinely novel. All you can do is cook it and see.\n \n \nNow all you need are some facts to back up your speculation. Particularly the assumption that \"no trait-specific information is passed down outside the gene\". \n\n \n It's not an assumption, and I'm not saying it's always true. What I'm saying is that if I can find a case where it is true, that represents a situation where RM could have been responsible for originating the trait. So if you're happy to proceed on that basis - that a real life example of a variant gene encapsulating all the novel, trait-specific information necessary, with none being passed down outside the gene, constitutes a falsification of your assertion than RM cannot induce a helpful trait - I'd be delighted to go looking for one.",

   "Well, not exactly. Our debate revolves arounf the question of whether or not a collection of nucleotides constitutes a 'gene' when that collection carries no information content that can be 'decoded' by an organism, or even more to the point, whether or not it is possible to have a collection of nucleotides/DNA molecules that do not, by their very existence alone, encode information that can be decoded by an organism.\n \n\n \n A \"gene\" is nothing more or less than a unit of inheritance. PHYSICALLY a gene is rather more than a \"collection\" of nucleotides. I do not know what your background is but your terminology is very hazy here. Lets put a little precision into it.\n \n A nucleotide is according to WIKI : \n \n a chemical compound that consists of 3 portions: a heterocyclic base, a sugar, and one or more phosphate groups. In the most common nucleotides the base is a derivative of purine or pyrimidine, and the sugar is the pentose (five-carbon sugar) deoxyribose or ribose. \n\n \n You can refer to the article to understand the structures.\n \n DNA on the otherhand is a polynucleotide described as:\n \nChemically, DNA is a long polymer of simple units called nucleotides, with a backbone made of sugars and phosphate groups joined by ester bonds. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of molecules called bases. It is the sequence of these four bases along the backbone that encodes information. This information is read using the genetic code, which specifies the sequence of the amino acids within proteins. The code is read by copying stretches of DNA into the related nucleic acid RNA, in a process called transcription. Most of these RNA molecules are used to synthesize proteins, but others are used directly in structures such as ribosomes and spliceosomes.\n\n \n DNA is rather more than just a \"collection\" a collection would not have a specific sequence of nucleotides and would not be of value in coding any information. Referring to DNA as a collection of nucleotides is imprecise and misleading, rather like referring to your computers memory as a collection of bits.\n \n \nAt this stage in the debate I do not believe that, as you believe, that the mere existence of conjoined DNA molecules/nucleotides, whatever, by the mere fact of their existence, encode information \n\n \n Now that is truly confused. It is not DNA molecules which are cojoined its nucleotides that are polymerized into a defined sequence along a linear polymer on each chain of the DNA molecule. When I ATTEMPT to translate your confused description I get the following: \"I do not believe DNA encodes information\"\n \n \n \nthat can be decoded by a developing organism into an organismic trait. And those that don't or can't do this should not, IMO, by referred to by using the same word, 'gene', that applies to those encoded molecules that can and do form such an important part of the mechanism of organismic heredity.\n\n \n And I translate that as meaning that you do not know whereof you speak, since the realtionship between DNA information and phenotypic traits is well established even though the traits arise indirectly through the interactions of gene products. DNA (along with the relevant internal control signals) specify RNA some of which in turn specify protein, and some of which serves as control, molecular machinery, and templating functions. In turn the RNAs and the proteins operate to produce the relevant traits either during development or during later life. Note well we are not speaking of hypotheticals here, we are speaking of experimentally demonstrable facts. You ignore the empirical facts at great risk to your arguments.",

Contra Marshall McLuhan, that is not the case with any symbolic information transportation system that I know of, and so if the genome is a symbolic information transportation system, then it is not true of it.\n And information is not simply data arrangements. The word \"context\" entails the systematization of data arrangements according to a pre-established, arbitrary but mutually agreed upon, perceptible forms. Meaning and significance, i.e., information cannot reside, intrinsically, in that which is perceived, but only extrinsically, in that which is able to discern the the 'context' in a 'form' by 'reading' or 'writing', i.e., imposing 'meaning' upon matter, so that when matter is physically transported, it carries the psychical 'meaning' with it.\n \n Now what you are insisting upon here is that the genetic 'code' is not a 'code'\n at all. That the molecule involved do not \"stand for\" anything but themselves. That they \"signify\" nothing, but simply are what they are. That they are \"data\", with no such thing as \"information\" or \"meaning\" in existence. That they are molecular configurations that linearly, mechanically, by an inevitable \n series of contiguous chemical reactions, must mechanically lead from state 'A' [gene] to state 'B', [organismic trait], simply as an unmodulated, uncontrolled, strictly physical, 'chain reaction'.\n \n That is not my understanding of the genetic code. My understanding is that the genetic code is truly a symbolic code that arbitrarily informs matter with significance via an arbitrary, pre-established, rule-governed system of 'signs'.\n \n Is this not the case? Being neither a geneticist nor a semiotician, all I have to go on is stuff like this--\n \n http://www.answers.com/topic/genetic-code?cat=health\n \n \n \n\n You've already said RM can produce exactly the same data (the gene) as would be produced via the 'encoding' of a trait.

I see no reference to new information \"spontaneously emerging\", or any of that rubbish, in what you've just said. All you've done is to stipulate a theoretical set of circumstances under which a certain physical effect might be achieved. That is, that two molecular configurations may coincidentally come to mimic/mirror one another. I granted that much ages ago.\n \n You then, as you have several times already, make the leap from identical data to identical information. And I have said, just as many times, that I will grant that if one configuration of molecules does not, yet or ever, symbolically represent any meaning or significance imposed upon it by the organismic code-writer/reader, then neither will another, identical configuration, be it intentionally or accidentally put together, symbolically represent any meaning or significance. Further, I grant that if a certain configuration does symbolically, arbitrarily, semiotically represent a certain meaning/significance imposed upon it by an external agent, [in this case an organism], then henceforth that configuration will become a 'sign', one that from then on will hold that same significance for like organisms and for other organisms with the ability to decode/read the information/message embodied in that physical configuration/sign/symbol. \n \n So far you are just recovering old ground.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n The point is that that is a really big \"if\".

Therefore if old info from elsewhere is somehow introduced as novel info here, then we are talking evolution, as far as the recipient is concerned. And I suppose that's true, in the sense of artificial evolution. But I'm not sure that artificial evolution, aka, genetic engineering, is pertinent to an understanding of natural evolution. In fact, it strikes me as ironic that, in order to make your hypothesis of natural evolution by random genetic mutation plausible, you have to appeal to genetic engineering, 'gene-splicing', which is intelligent design as ever was.",

A food parcel is an example of the medium being the message; a recipe is not.\n\n \n **\n The only \"shabby\" business here is the way you follow the darwinist tradition of switching your argument back and forth. In this case, one minute you argue for the genome and its \"genes\" as symbolic representations of information, that is, a semiotic information system, as per your 'recipe', and the next minute you you portray the genome and its genes as a mechanical, physical, chemically linear, straightforward chain of contiguous molecules reacting with one another from point 'a', a \"gene\", on through to point 'z', an organismic trait-- [as per your 'food parcel', or better, the delivery of a a 'instant nourishment', such as, 'heat and serve', or 'just add hot water and stir', or even, ' swallow capsule with liquid', or whatnot]. As in so many instances of darwinist argumentation, you insist that you have the 'right' to eat your cake and to have it, too. Well, surprise, you guys do not have that right anymore than anyone else does. So in this case, make up your mind. Is the genome a semiotic information system, like Morse Code, or is it a simple mechanical transformation system, like steam engine?\n In case you're wondering, such systems are categorically different from one another. The latter simply 'is what it is', while the former also 'signifies that which it is not'. Semiotic systems are always tripartite. There is always the 'code', the 'code writer', and the 'code reader', in addition to the dualism of the 'medium' and the 'message'. Material/physical/chemical systems are unitary--the medium is the message, and the 'effect' is strictly determined by physical mechanics and nothing else.\n This latter view is the Materialist interpretation of the entire fact of existence, of the entire universe, of all phenomena of every kind, including the phenomenon of genetic inheritance. It goes entirely counter the Idealist belief that information is real, that 'ideation' is real, that motivation is real, that intelligence and volition are real, that emotions are real [not just, 'epiphenomena'],and that the genome is a semiotic information processing and redistribution system.\n So stop bouncing between the Materialist view [as perfectly exemplified by chemist], and Idealist view of the genome. Are we talking of a semiotic code, here, or are we talking of a mechanical process of chained chemical reactions?\n Pick one and stick with it. \n \n \n \n\n As we've repeatedly acknowledged, RM can mimic the message, so how 'symbolic' it might be is irrelevant.\n\n \n **\n You're joking, right?!?\n \n \n \n\n All that concerns us now is whether or not that message can be decoded.\n\n \n **\n And that depends upon a/the reader's knowledge of the symbolism involved in the code, and, b/the symbolism expressed in the received medium. That is why, \"how 'symbolic' it might be is irrelevant\", is a joke. Unless, secretly, you believe with the materialists that 'symbolism' isn't 'real', anyway.\n \n [quote]\n Quote:\n You then, as you have several times already, make the leap from identical data to identical information. \n \n \n\n There's no leap to make. Identical data represents identical information unless the context (ie the receiver, the developmental apparatus dec'oding the symbolic message) is changed.\n\n \n **\n Well, that is the point! Context matters in a semiotic situation. And if \"the developmental apparatus decoding the symbolic message[] is changed\", then it is highly pertinent to know both 'how' and 'why' it was changed. And these same questions would apply if the 'code' signs were changed, and/or if the 'code writer' were changed.\n \n \n\n Say I am handed a message that has been accidentally altered, and then handed one that has been deliberately altered in exactly the same way so as to encode particular information (analogous to RM creating a variant gene prior to any putative 'deliberate encoding' of a trait).

I give you a long train of exactly the same straight answers, and you ignore them. Instead, since I do not simply bow to your wishes and accept your contorted thinking and your constant and repeated switching back and forth from a mechanical to a semiotic concept of biological inheritance, you then have the brass to accuse ME of being evasive!!! Preposterous!\n \n \n\n If you disagree, then please, provide an illustrative example where two identical sets of data, received via the same pathway, represent different information to the same recipient.\n\n \n **\n Some dittohead used to like to play that game here, using English. I think the word he fastened upon was 'port'. Which, like so much in semiotics, means totally different things in different contexts. So when you say that one of an established code's 'signs' is \"received via the same pathway\" you necessitate two things; one, a pre-established pathway, and; two, an unaltered pathway identical to the pre-established pathway. Given those preconditions,[exact same sign, exact same 'context'], I long, long, ago agreed that the message interpreted[ organismic outcome] would be the same whether its 'sign' was written purposefully, or accidentally-- ['accidental' being something that is statistically possible only in the very simplest messages, such as your beloved 'point mutations']. In case of \"genes\", it is now established that identical molecular configurations [sequences?] can \"mean\" different things under different ' circumstances/contexts', and that different molecular configurations [genetic 'signs'] can mean the same things under different circumstances['readers', 'pathways', 'contexts']. Which empirical fact, BTW, proves conclusively that the genomic inheritance system is a semiotic information system, and not a materialist/mechanical/chemical system.\n \n Apart from that, for the billioneth time, as above, please accept my assuirance that where and when all elements of causation are nearly identical, paricularly wrt organismic traits, then the traits generated will be very similar. That is, this time please take yes for an answer to the question you actually pose, even if it isn't a 'yes' wrt to the question you simply imply.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n then henceforth that configuration will become a 'sign', one that from then on will hold that same significance for like organisms and for other organisms with the ability to decode/read the information/message embodied in that physical configuration/sign/symbol. \n \n \n Again, if these 'like organisms' can read a 'sign' within a particular configuration, why couldn't they have read the same 'sign' earlier in a gene altered via RM?\n\n \n **\n Because, for the 40th time, a physical pattern is not a 'sign' until it 'signifies'/'stands for'/'symbolizes' something that is not its own self. You are assuming that if a person 'knows' an alphabet, that can, will, and indeed, must, be able to 'read' a 'meaning' into any old alphabetical/symbolical/sign combination that pops up. Such as-- *%$^&*$@!!_^%$R. I 'wrote' that, and although it might mean something to me [it does not], it cannot possibly mean anything to you, unless and until we agree on a meaning for it. The same for an organism receiving genetic gibberish.\n \n \n\n What other new information have they been passed that is required for them to understand what the 'sign' means?\n\n \n **\n As above, for the gazillioneth time, the new information about what, particularly, the new sign signifies. That is, the trait itself.\n \n \n\n And by what pathway has that other information been transferred?\n\n \n **\n As per several posts earlier;-- Novel environmental stimulus-<adapting organism-< novel organismic trait and its 'information'-<organism-<genome-<offspring. In its simplest, and somewhat misleading, overly-linear/direct form.\n \n \n\n Is it really sensible to picture a bunch of bacteria sitting there, looking at these RM variant genes cropping up and 'thinking': \"meaningless... meaningless... meaningless... hang on, I feel a disturbance in the force, like a bacterium somewhere just encoded a trait in this exact form! Yes, I see it now, it's a sign!\"\n\n \n **\n No, it's really silly, in fact.

Second, what exactly constitutes the alpha and the omega of \"a gene\"? [do the enzymes count?] Third, what is involved in the 'transfer', and what 'baggage' comes with that process?\n \n And finally, if a 'gene' is inserted into a new place that is the perfect replica of the 'old' place/context, then why shouldn't it, [as I've repeated a billion times], be 'read' the same way and to the same 'effect'? Why do you keep asking the same question over and over and over and over and over and over again? A different organism does not equal a novel gene or a novel trait. Just a mechanical displacement from one organism to another with the same code and the same inherent ability to read that code and behave accordingly, actuating that trait in a different place. Hardly much different from getting fruit flies to put their wings where their mouths are.",

If no other, parallel information needs to be passed (no explanation of what new symbols mean), then an identical RM-originated gene will have the effect of expressing the trait in the offspring, regardless of whether any organism has ever expressed or encoded that trait before. It will work because while the individual instructions may not be new, cumulatively they (together with any novel molecular tools 'inlined' in the gene itself) describe the construction of a never-before-existing trait.\n \n \nIt is the 'intelligence/volition' pathway enabled by \"Vitality\", the mechanism necessary to the writing of new, novel information.

I simply see it as a basic 4-letter aphabet that forms 'words' that when connected by 'context' form 'sentences' that signify certain chemical behaviours to be undertaken by the organism reading the 'message'. That is, I see no need to change the alphabet at all, and very little need for neologisms; so little that their generation would be extremely rare, I should imagine. After all, as I've been pointing out to darwinists for decades, novelty is the very antithesis of preservation, and inheritance, what the genome is all about, is entirely devoted to preservation of the 'status quo'. Any novelty or relativity or subjectivity within the genetic code itself, [as opposed to the messages it is used to write], would defeat its own purpose. \n \n \n\n Also, it's not true that a gene must be entirely a semiotic code or entirely not.

To 'define' is to confine, delineate, erect boundaries and parameters around, indicate the limits of, delimit, and render non-nebulous, precise, unequivocal, and 'definite'.\n \n What are the options? Is a \"gene\" just a 'sequence' of contiguous \n 'nucleotides'? Or is it the information recorded by an organism about its own organic traits, written out in nucleotides that are kept in that particular portion of its anatomy that is transferable/transportable during reproduction?

You don't need new words to write a new book; you don't need new terminology to describe a new design of bridge.

The analogy with an Allen key is not necessarily so wide of the mark in some cases. So trying to pigeonhole genes as being entirely symbolic or entirely functional is probably a fallacy\n \n However, the salient point to take away from this is that the symbolic/instructional or 'tool-like'/functional or 'bit of both' nature of any particular gene is irrelevant to considerations of whether the trait it describes could be of RM origin - the only thing that can prohibit RM from originating a trait via the origination of a gene is a requirement for 'that-trait'-specific alterations to the decoding context. \n \n So like I've been saying, if I can show you an example of a trait where no trait-specific changes are needed outside the gene itself, that's a trait that could first emerge via RM.

What you are being deliberately obtuse about this time is that I speak of the genetic code in terms of a '4-letter alphabet' in this context;i.e., wrt a change in 'letter' combination, as in a 'point mutation', [a change in a single nucleotide base or whatever the correct term is]. After all, your whole argument has depended, from the jump, on the idiosyncrasy of 'point mutations' in eubacteria plasmids, latterly the utility of this idiosyncrasy in genetic engineering, i.e., 'gene-splicing'. And since a 'point mutation' is analogous to 're-arranged letters', and not to 're-used words', that, to all whose eyes are not 'wide-shut', is quite plainly the point of my above statement. \n \n I am perfectly comfortable with the re-use of old common-usage words, or even entire, hackneyed, 'figures of speech', as it were, in a novel, original context,-- but that has no analogy with your mechanically accidental[random], novel 'point mutations'. They amount to nothing more than a bluff in a scrabble game, a letter combo that 'signifies' nothing that exists.\n \n \n \n Quote:\n And if your 'b/', \"relate to 'tools' provided within the gene itself\", means that the word \"gene\" means a whole lot more than just contiguous DNA molecules, then I think I'll withold further comment until you've cleared up just what \"tools\" you think \"genes\" inherently possess that enable them, under their own steam, [so to speak], to impose a new and productive 'trait' on a passively accepting, 'innocent bystander' of an organism. \n \n \n Well, one very simple way of looking at this is that genes can directly code for a particular 'shape' protein, which themselves physically interact with other chemicals during the day-to-day operation of the organism.\n\n \n The issue is that the term, 'code for', and the terms, 'build, construct, make, manufacture, etc.', mean very different things to most users of the English language, and so are not interchangeable. You are goinmg to have to make up your mind and pick one or ther other. \"Code for\" means a message/instruction signifying, eg., 'strike nail with hammer', whereas, \"physically interact\", is what actually takes place when a nail is struck by a hammer. You cannot have this both ways wrt to the \"genes\", per se!!! Are the proteins interacting because the cell read the DNA message to make them interact, or are the proteins interacting as an inescapable mechanical consequence of certain nucleotides being laid out in a certain physical pattern?\n \n \n\n The analogy with an Allen key is not necessarily so wide of the mark in some cases. So trying to pigeonhole genes as being entirely symbolic or entirely functional is probably a fallacy\n\n \n **\n I'm not trying to \"pigeonhole\" genes--I'm trying to get you people to define them. You use the term every chance you get, so isn't it time to make a hard and fast decision as to what the word actually means, i.e., what being a 'gene' actually entails?\n \n \n\n However, the salient point to take away from this is that the symbolic/instructional or 'tool-like'/functional or 'bit of both' nature of any particular gene is irrelevant to considerations of whether the trait it describes could be of RM origin -\n\n \n **\n You have got to be joking.\n \n \n\n the only thing that can prohibit RM from originating a trait via the origination of a gene is a requirement for 'that-trait'-specific alterations to the decoding context.\n\n \n **\n Well, I know that that's your story and you guys have stuck to it for over 80 years, but there is absolutely no rational reason for the rest of us to buy into this assumption of yours, especially when you can't or won't define the key word, 'gene'.\n \n \n\n So like I've been saying, if I can show you an example of a trait where no trait-specific changes are needed outside the gene itself,\n\n \n **\n Well, before getting too far ahead of yourself, define 'gene' cogently, so that we can all know unequivocally just what it is, and is not, that which you intend when you use that term. Otherwise how is anyone to know what, \"outside the gene itself\", encompasses?\n \n \n\n that's a trait that could first emerge via RM.\n\n \n **\n Look, for the umpteenth time, organismic 'traits' are distinct from genetic mutations, unless and until you can prove that the two are only the opposite ends of one immutable, deterministic, linear, physical continuum. That is the materialist POV, but I do not buy it, and you have not proved it. Simply repeating this metaphysical assumption of yours will not turn it into a fact.\n \n \n\n And given the statistical likelihood of RM producing any given variant gene in a large population, even if organisms are as you claim 'deliberately encoding' such traits, RM would probably beat them to it somewhere within the population.\n\n \n **\n This statement is still nothing but a meaningless patchwork of empty assumptions parading as empirical fact. It's all entirely circular, an exercise in question-begging, where your premises and your conclusions are indistinguishable from one another.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

Was I wrong to read that the way I did?\n\n \n **\n No, you were not wrong to read that, because that is what I said, and that is what I meant. Your mistake lies in being unable to distingish a 'letter' from a 'word', where a single nucleotide insertion/deletion/duplication, aka, 'point mutation', refers to a 'letter' change, and not a 'word' change, genetically-speaking.\n \n \n This has already been clearly explained to you several times, but you insist upon your misinterpretation, and so I have no expectation of comprehension on your part this time, or ever. But one last time into the breach--\n \n There is a difference in any semiotic process of communication between basic 'signs' and the 'message' they 'transmit' between 'sender' and 'receiver'.\n \n In western culture we use an 'alphabet', basic 'signs' which are purposefully and deliberately put together into 'words' that have a mutually agreed upon, previously determined, universally accepted, 'meaning', understood [with allowance for context] by both sender and receiver. Other cultures use hieroglyphs, or glyphs, or pictographic patterns, in which a certain basic 'sign' stands for a certain word, or morpheme, in se, logographically. But it is my understanding that wrt the genome, we are talking about an alphabetic, not a logographic, semiotic system. That is, the 4 basic elements of DNA each act as 'letters' that make up 'words', and not as four specified 'words'.\n \n That means, as has already been explained and re-explained, that a 'point mutation', the idiosyncrasy that your argument depends upon, is a 'letter' change, not a 'word' change, as you keep falsely insisting that it is. The fact of semiotics is that in an alphabetic system, the insertion, deletion, or duplication of a 'letter' does not, in and of itself, create a 'word' [although it may destroy one]. \n [By the same token, a new chinese 'word' symbol is not created each time a child incorrectly draws the pattern that stands for an 'old' word. But that's not exactly analogous to the genetic code, I don't believe, even though it has the same effect--accidental or erroneous 'sign' changes never generate new meaning, per se.]\n \n However, in the case of 'traits', usually the replication of any given trait requires not just a change in a 'word', but a change in a systematic combination of words, i.e., a 'sentence', or even several 'sentences', making up a complex _set_ of 'instructions'. In such cases your 'random accident spontaneously generating novel information deterministically/mechanically leading to a novel trait' becomes patently absurd.\n \n Which is why you are 'betting your farm' on the 'point mutations', i.e., single nucleotide insertions, deletions, and/or duplications, in the idiosyncratic plasmid DNA of eubacteria.\n Which, for those who don't know, is entirely distinct from their chromosomal DNA. See-\n \n \"Sci-Tech Encyclopedia --\n Plasmid \n A circular extrachromosomal genetic element that is ubiquitous in prokaryotes and has also been identified in a number of eukaryotes. In general, bacterial plasmids can be classified into two groups on the basis of the number of genes and functions they carry. The larger plasmids are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules of around 100 kilobase (kb) pairs, which is sufficient to code for approximately 100 genes. There is usually a small number of copies of these plasmids per host chromosome, so that their replication must be precisely coordinated with the cell division cycle. The plasmids in the second group are smaller in size, about 6-10 kb. These plasmids may harbor 6-10 genes and are usually present in multiple copies (10-20 per chromosome). See also Gene.\n \n Plasmids have been identified in a large number of bacterial genera. Some bacterial species harbor plasmids with no known functions (cryptic plasmids) which have been identified as small circular molecules present in the bacterial DNA. The host range of a particular plasmid is usually limited to closely related genera. Some plasmids, however, are much more promiscuous and have a much broader host range.\n \n The functions specified by different bacterial plasmids are usually quite specialized in nature. Moreover, they are not essential for cell growth since the host bacteria are viable without a plasmid when the cells are cultured under conditions that do not select for plasmid-specified gene products. Plasmids thus introduce specialized functions to host cells which provide versatility and adaptability for growth and survival. Plasmids which confer antibiotic resistance (R plasmids) have been extensively characterized because of their medical importance. Plasmids have played a seminal role in the spectacular advances in the area of genetic engineering. Individual genes can be inserted into specific sites on plasmids in cell cultures and the recombinant plasmid thus formed introduced into a living cell by the process of bacterial transformation. See also Genetic engineering.\n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- at-- answers.com\n \n In such a 'special case', you insist that a 'letter change', which I agree can occur by accident, automatically, in se, generates a 'word change'. But there is no rational reason to believe that any change in the letters of an established word must necessarily generate a another, [but equally established and accepted], word, i.e., one already charged with a different meaning. It may, or it may not. It may simply turn a word into alphabetic nonsense.\n OTH, there is every rational reason to believe that NO random 'letter change'/'point mutation' in an old 'word' [\"gene\"?!?] ever generates a brand-new, \"word/gene\", one with a brand-new/original, heretofore non-existent, meaning, one that newly determines the origin of a 'brand-new'/original organismic trait that, heretofore, did not exist. Creatio ex nihilo.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n And since a 'point mutation' is analogous to 're-arranged letters', and not to 're-used words', that, to all whose eyes are not 'wide-shut', is quite plainly the point of my above statement. \n \n \n I could equally well assign them thus:\n \n Nucleotide = letter\n Triplet = word\n Gene = sentence\n Genome = story\n \n Now, every point mutation (letter substitution) entails a word change. There are no 'new' words, only new sentences.\n\n \n **\n This is arrant nonsense. I can't believe that you could say something this irrational! A 'word' is not a 'word' unless it _means_ something. A simple 'letter' change does NOT, as above, necessarily change one established meaning [word] into a different established meaning [word], although it may do. But even when it does change one word's meaning into another word's meaning, the only thing that can be said of it with certainty is that it destroys the productivity of the original word within the semiotic system. You may suppose that the accidentally altered letter combo, the 'switch' from one accepted 'word' to another, will somehow _increase_ the system's productivity,[i.e., create a newly adaptive trait], but that is nothing more more than an irrational metaphysical assumption that violates 'creatio ex nihilo'.\n \n And your, \"There are no 'new' words, only new sentences.\", simply compounds the irrationality, one might say the insanity, of it all!\n \n \n\n Or I could omit the 'word' construct entirely; it's perfectly possible for languages to consist only of letters and sentences (Chinese, maybe? If not, it's trivial to invent one). Unless you can justify your choice of syntactic analogy, I see no reason to allow you to use it as logical justification for what alterations to a gene can or cannot accomplish.\n\n \n **\n Done.

Trouble is, that belief doesn't stand up to the empirical scrutiny of modern developmental biology, or even genomics.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Well, before getting too far ahead of yourself, define 'gene' cogently, so that we can all know unequivocally just what it is, and is not, that which you intend when you use that term.

In a discussiomn of what 'genes' can or cannot do, it's a 'red herring' to demand a cogent definition of what a 'gene' is. Duh!\n \n \n\n I could equally well demand the same of you, since you're making all these pronouncements about what changes to a gene can and cannot accomplish.\n\n \n **\n Except that I am doing no such thing. What I am doing is making one solitary pronouncement on what 'random chance' can or cannot do, and that is, 'ex nihilo, ab nihilo, nihil fit'. You cannot get something from nothing. Included in that is the fact that you cannot get increased productivity into a system out of thin air, by spontaneous generation. And that includes the rational assumption that you cannot get increased productivity, or adaptive novelty, i.e., original traits, into a biosystem/organism, simply by accidental nucleotide re-arrangements. That is, your 'point mutations' in eubacterial plasmid DNA. Let alone anywhere else.\n \n \n\n My argument applies regardless of what a gene represents: if no other trait-specific information is required, then we know the novel gene represents enough.\n\n \n **\n Ridiculous. How can you separate 'trait specific' information from 'genetic information' unless you can specify exactly what it is that a 'gene' is?!? All you are doing here is insisting, once again, that the 'gene' and the 'trait' are the exact same thing, at least in terms of 'information content'. But that is simply not true! In fact, it is ridiculously untrue, unless you also have some peculiar and arcane definition for the word, 'information', as well. Do you? Do you define 'information' as 'the physical patterns assumed by contiguous atoms', or something such?\n \n \n\n I'm really perplexed as to why you're refusing to take the logical step I'm proposing. All your objections to RM originating traits rest upon the requirement for additional trait specific information existing outside the gene:\n\n \n **\n And I am astounded that you are incapable of understanding that a symbol cannot signify anything until _after_ there is something 'there' for it to signify.\n \n You may not realise it, but you repeatedly try to sidestep this fact by implying that there is no such thing as a 'symbol', [that is, that the genetic code is not a 'code', that it is not something that 'stands for', 'signifies', something that it is not, i.e., a trait, but rather, actually IS the 'trait' itself]. Which means that there is no such thing as 'meaning' or 'a meaning', which means that there is no such thing as 'information'. In short, you simply reiterate the materialist premise that reality consists of nothing but bits of stuff banging into one another and magically generating the wonders of reality, [including all laws, forces, constants, and the intellibility they generate], by random accident, ex nihilo.\n \n Thus you insist that I \"logically\" accept your premise that a 'gene', an 'aggregation of contiguous molecules/nucleotides', and all 'trait specific information', are one and the same thing. Well, sorry, but I simply do not see the \"logic\" of that.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n You do not need a new alphabet to write a new 'word', but that which that word signifies must pre-exist the 'letter combo' that stands for it, semiotically\n That is, a simple recombination of familiar letters into an unfamiliar pattern does not really constitute the generation of a new and valid 'word'. \n \n \n You're saying external, contextual information specific to that trait and that trait alone is always necessary -\n\n \n **\n Always necessary to what? To the replication of that trait? Yes. To the origin of that trait? No. WRT origins, I am saying the opposite--i.e., that the trait is necessary to the existence of any \"external, contextual information specific\n to that trait\". That is, that no information, particularly external placed information, about anything at all, including a trait, cannot exist until after the trait itself exists. If you cannot understand that, then I cannot help you.\n And as I keep pointing out, you keep making a metaphysical assertion, an irrational metaphysical assertion, that assemblages of nucleotides, per se, are the informational equivalent of the traits to be expressed. That is, that 'gene'='trait', and also that 'gene'='any assembage of nucleotides', so that you can claim that 'trait'='any assemblage of nucleotides'. And, amazingly, you are \"perplexed\" that I don't buy into this \"logic\". !\n \n \n \n\n all I'm saying is \"Ok, so if I can show an example where it isn't - making the novel gene not analogous to a new word, but rather a new sentence -\n\n \n **\n No idea what you mean. I don't care whether you compare a \"gene\" to a word, a sentence, or an entire owner's manual. Just give it a cogent, unequivocal definition before you go slinging it all over the place. Your \"Natural Selection\" means everything and nothing, your \"Fitness\" is equally nebulous, and here you are doing the same thing to your 'key word', \"gene\". All fundamental to darwinist 'smoke and mirrors'.\n \n \n\n I've proved you wrong\", yet you balk at that suggestion. Surely you're not worried that I'm actually going to find such an example?\n\n \n **\n I have no idea what it is that you think you can do, but I'll tell you what you cannot do, and will not do--you will not throw together a purely random sequence of nucleotides-- [call that a 'gene' if that is how you wish to define the word, 'gene']-- that when 'spliced' into any random organism does any more than diminish the intrinsic productivity of that organism, [in its own terms]. The most that you will generate in that organism will be some form of trait degeneration.\n \n So, just to keep you from wasting time, do not trot out an example of a intelligently engineered reconstruction of nucleotides, one connected to known and established traits in some specific organism, that when intelligently, but artificially and with much requisite molecular and organic alteration and tinkering included, is inserted into the plasmid DNA of an eubacterium, results in a humanly intended outcome unrelated to that bacterium's own agendum. \n Such as human insulin, for instance.",

   "No, you were not wrong to read that, because that is what I said, and that is what I meant. Your mistake lies in being unable to distingish a 'letter' from a 'word',\n\n \n Sorry, WW, but you don't get to just rewrite history. I wrote this:\n \nYou're assuming that for a novel product (trait) to be described, the code itself must always be changed: new symbols added, or the meaning of existing symbols altered. This is a fallacy.\n\n To which you responded:\n \nYou do not need a new alphabet to write a new 'word', but that which that word signifies must pre-exist the 'letter combo' that stands for it, semiotically.\n That is, a simple recombination of familiar letters into an unfamiliar pattern does not really constitute the generation of a new and valid 'word'. \n\n Notice your repeated use of the phrase 'new word' in relation to novel traits. So I said:\n \nOk, you're not assuming that new letters are required. Fair enough. But you are assuming that new words are required. This is a fallacy.\n\n At which point you contradicted yourself by saying:\n \nI am assuming no such thing.\n\n So which is it? Do you insist novel traits always require new 'words', or not?\n \nBut it is my understanding that wrt the genome, we are talking about an alphabetic, not a logographic, semiotic system. That is, the 4 basic elements of DNA each act as 'letters' that make up 'words', and not as four specified 'words'.\n\n If, as you say, the 4 basic elements of DNA act as letters, then codons are words, of which there are 64, between them coding for 20 amino acids.\n \n A point mutation, while most do change only a letter, inevitably alters the codon of which they are a part to a different but still meaningful word. Single point insertions or deletions can cause a 'frameshift', where the triplets are shifted by one, eg:\n \n TTTAAAGGG -< ATTTAAAGGG\n \n These cause a wholesale change to the 'sentence' the gene represents, and as you would expect aren't often anything but destructive. However, one such frameshift did give the nylon-eating bug its altered palette.\n \nHowever, in the case of 'traits', usually the replication of any given trait requires not just a change in a 'word', but a change in a systematic combination of words, i.e., a 'sentence', or even several 'sentences', making up a complex _set_ of 'instructions'. In such cases your 'random accident spontaneously generating novel information deterministically/mechanically leading to a novel trait' becomes patently absurd.\n\n \n Why are you dredging this up again? Empirically, novel traits are found to be 'encoded' as single point mutations within a gene, so absurd or not it does happen. Don't argue with me, argue with the bacteria!\n \n \nWhich is why you are 'betting your farm' on the 'point mutations', i.e., single nucleotide insertions, deletions, and/or duplications, in the idiosyncratic plasmid DNA of eubacteria. Which, for those who don't know, is entirely distinct from their chromosomal DNA.\n\n \n I'm quite aware of the distinction, thanks :) And no, I'm not just talking about plasmid DNA, although for some reason you always seem to forget and go back to assuming I am, no matter how many times I supply examples of chromosomal DNA changes.\n \n \nBut there is no rational reason to believe that any change in the letters of an established word must necessarily generate a another, [but equally established and accepted], word,\n\n Yes there is, when the 'words' are codons, all of which are meaningful.\n \nYou may suppose that the accidentally altered letter combo, the 'switch' from one accepted 'word' to another, will somehow _increase_ the system's productivity,[i.e., create a newly adaptive trait], but that is nothing more more than an irrational metaphysical assumption that violates 'creatio ex nihilo'.\n\n You've still never explained how that axiom is supposed to apply when what constitutes or leads to 'increased productivity' varies depending upon the environment, or how it would be violated anyway given that mutations empirically can and do occur prior to the environment in which they confer an advantage. Your axiom wouldn't know where to start. \"Hmm, ok, you're a harmful mutation, you can happen. Oh ####, the environment's changed and you're a useful mutation! I take it back, you can't have happened!\"\n \n \nIOW, you are finally admitting to the materialist belief that the genetic code is not a code at all,\n\n \n Please don't twist what I said. I clearly stated that DNA could be both symbolic and, through the physical proteins it directly and unambiguously describes, provide chemically active 'tools'. \n \n \nYeah, right. In a discussiomn of what 'genes' can or cannot do, it's a 'red herring' to demand a cogent definition of what a 'gene' is. Duh!\n\n \n No duh, just logic so simple it borders on the trivial. If we want to know whether the emergence of the gene itself, via RM, is sufficient for the trait to be expressed, we need only establish that no other novel, trait-specific contextual changes to the organism are required. Whatever the gene is, whatever it represents, whatever symbolism and tools are contained therein, if no other trait-specific info is needed then the origination of the gene via RM will result in the trait being expressed.\n \n \nWhat I am doing is making one solitary pronouncement on what 'random chance' can or cannot do, and that is, 'ex nihilo, ab nihilo, nihil fit'. You cannot get something from nothing. Included in that is the fact that you cannot get increased productivity into a system out of thin air, by spontaneous generation.\n\n \n What I'm challenging is your assumption that 'increased productivity', especially when that can entail completely different and even conflicting things in a changing environment, falls within the remit of that axiom. You've never been able to explain how it can apply when the traits that lead to increased productivity in one environment can be detrimental in another, and when we observe them to emerge prior to, or in the complete absence of, the environment to which they are adaptive.\n \n \nAnd I am astounded that you are incapable of understanding that a symbol cannot signify anything until _after_ there is something 'there' for it to signify.\n\n \n You assume I'm continuing to argue because I'm stupid. This is not the case. You keep falling back upon the assumption that new symbols/words are required to describe new traits - yet you provided valid examples of novelty (books and bridge designs) that require neither new symbols (letters) nor new words to describe. So why don't you put the gun down, bandage that foot up and we can move on ;)\n \n \nYou may not realise it, but you repeatedly try to sidestep this fact by implying that there is no such thing as a 'symbol',\n\n \n That's an untruth that treads perilously close to the 'L' word, WW, and I'll thank you not to repeat it. I've clearly and repeatedly said that DNA can be symbolic. All I've said is that one can describe a novel design using a novel configuration of existing symbols. You brought up books and bridge designs, both of which directly support my hypothesis.\n \n \nAlways necessary to what? To the replication of that trait? Yes.\n\n \n Ok, great. So if I can show an example that contradicts your claim, a case where no trait-specific information is required to be transferred except the gene itself, then I've shown a situation where the RM origin of the gene would successfully masquerade as the inheritance of an intentionally encoded gene, yes? The organism receiving such a gene would 'believe' it was inheriting an encoded trait, and since no information would be missing, it would follow the instructions and thus end up expressing the trait the gene appeared to encode.\n \n Just like if you were handed a recipe with a typesetting error: if it only represents a novel combination of ingredients and not an ingredient you don't recognise, you would follow the instructions and end up with the dish the recipe appeared to encode, even though it had never before been cooked. \n \n \nSuch as human insulin, for instance.\n\n \n Actually, that does raise a relevant point, but we'll get to that all in good time.",

Your mistake lies in being unable to distingish a 'letter' from a 'word', \n \n \n Sorry, WW, but you don't get to just rewrite history. I wrote this:\n \n Quote:\n You're assuming that for a novel product (trait) to be described, the code itself must always be changed: new symbols added, or the meaning of existing symbols altered. This is a fallacy. \n \n To which you responded:\n \n Quote:\n You do not need a new alphabet to write a new 'word', but that which that word signifies must pre-exist the 'letter combo' that stands for it, semiotically.\n That is, a simple recombination of familiar letters into an unfamiliar pattern does not really constitute the generation of a new and valid 'word'. \n \n Notice your repeated use of the phrase 'new word' in relation to novel traits. So I said:\n \n Quote:\n Ok, you're not assuming that new letters are required. Fair enough. But you are assuming that new words are required. This is a fallacy. \n \n At which point you contradicted yourself by saying:\n \n Quote:\n I am assuming no such thing. \n \n So which is it? Do you insist novel traits always require new 'words', or not?\n\n \n **\n Let's put this in context. First you accused me of believing that the genetic code was an alphabet that required brand new 'letters' in order to construct brand new 'words'. That is what you said here--\n \"You're assuming that for a novel product (trait) to be described, the code itself must always be changed: new symbols added, or the meaning of existing symbols altered. This is a fallacy. It's perfectly possible to describe the construction of a new or improved end product using only pre-existing terminology.\" \n \n To which assertion I replied--\n **\n \"This is entirely false. I do not see the genetic code as a 'one-time pad' that must be re-configured after every use. I simply see it as a basic 4-letter aphabet that forms 'words' that when connected by 'context' form 'sentences' that signify certain chemical behaviours to be undertaken by the organism reading the 'message'. That is, I see no need to change the alphabet at all, and very little need for neologisms; so little that their generation would be extremely rare, I should imagine.\"\n \n Clearly this exchange pertains to 'letter' generation and invention, not 'word' generation and invention. Most importantly, the word 'traits' is not used, nor is the idea of 'traits' referred to, not even obliquely, in any of it. So let's follow the discussion a little further.\n \n In your next response you say--\n \"Ok, you're not assuming that new letters are required. Fair enough. But you are assuming that new words are required. This is a fallacy. You don't need new words to write a new book; you don't need new terminology to describe a new design of bridge. These are your own, and therefore presumably valid, examples of novelty, and neither of them necessitate the kind of external, contextual semantic novelty that would prohibit them originating via RM.\"\n \n I assumed that here you were making a comparison between a new 'book', a new 'bridge', and a new 'trait'. Now the thing about 'books' and 'bridges' and all such things is that you do not have to invent a new word, a 'neologism', every time you make a another one- [i.e., reproduce, replicate, re-do]- of them, modified somewhat according to context. But somewhere in their history there had to be a 'first bridge', for example,-- an original 'something that connected a gap between two points'-- before the word, 'bridge', could be invented to express such a phenomenon meaningfully. That is, without having to actually build another bridge every time you needed to describe one to somebody.\n Note the difference between building yet another bridge, or writing yet another book, and creating something for which there is as yet no 'word', because it is more than just 'another' anything. It is totally original. Like a new drug, or whatever. Then you have to invent a word for it. But, [for instance], the actual subatomic particle has to exist, and be discovered, _before_ the neologism, 'quark', can be invented to represent it, semiotically. These sub-atomic particles were not brought into existence, out of nothingness, by someone simply putting the letter-combination 'q-u-a-r-k' on the blackboard.\n Which is the magic that you are claiming for your 'point mutations'.\n \n And so I replied to you thus--\n **\n I am assuming no such thing. In fact, as you read further, you'll see where I speak against any tendency towards frequent genetic 'neologisms'. What you are being deliberately obtuse about this time is that I speak of the genetic code in terms of a '4-letter alphabet' in this context;i.e., wrt a change in 'letter' combination, as in a 'point mutation', [a change in a single nucleotide base or whatever the correct term is]. After all, your whole argument has depended, from the jump, on the idiosyncrasy of 'point mutations' in eubacteria plasmids, latterly the utility of this idiosyncrasy in genetic engineering, i.e., 'gene-splicing'. And since a 'point mutation' is analogous to 're-arranged letters', and not to 're-used words', that, to all whose eyes are not 'wide-shut', is quite plainly the point of my above statement. \n \n I am perfectly comfortable with the re-use of old common-usage words, or even entire, hackneyed, 'figures of speech', as it were, in a novel, original context,-- but that has no analogy with your mechanically accidental[random], novel 'point mutations'. They amount to nothing more than a bluff in a scrabble game, a letter combo that 'signifies' nothing that exists.\"\n \n Now, as anyone but you could tell, I was focusing, not on 'trait changes' in general, but on the totally novel traits that you suppose are the direct result of a 'point mutation'--the idea that writing 'q u a r k' on the board resulted in the existence of 'quarks'. Which is quite different from building the billioneth bridge, whether you call it a 'bridge' or a 'pont', and even if it is very differently made from every other 'bridge' ever made. Out of 'quarks', perhaps, and 'bridging the gap' between 'molecules', or who knows what. A bridge is a bridge is a bridge.\n \n So what we see now is this. You are trying to equate, in the minds of our readers, but especially in my own, your concept that 'a trait is a trait is a trait', just like with books and bridges. Therefore the kind of original phenomenon, such as novel antibiotic resistance, that can be correlated with a 'point mutation', is no different from giraffes' necks becoming longer than an okapis'.\n Note that although they are different 'traits' distinguishing different species, 'a neck is a neck is a neck'. But novel antibiotic resistance requires something essentially original, in cellular terms. \n \n Which shows that your lumping of all 'trait' changes into one category is false. There are two kinds of _trait_ changes. Those that are something essentially novel, and those that are only modifications of the non-essential, non-defining, properties of an established trait. For the latter, old 'words' will suffice, but for the former, new words must be invented in order to signify their novel existence. This radical, qualitative difference between 'original' and 'modified', wrt 'traits', must not be blurred or equivocated--to do so is prevarication, plain and simple.\n \n So let us stipulate the case in point, i.e., 'point mutation in the plasmid DNA of eubacteria', as correlated, for instance, to novel antibiotic resistance'. That is an instance of a novel 'trait' corresponding to a novel 'letter combination', where once the correspondence is made meaningful, i.e., after the existence of the resistance, a certain letter combo [point mutation] can be said to have become a new 'word', because it now signifies something that exists--i.e., the brand new behaviours which a cell [and by simple extension, its descendents] must do in order to resist the damage done to it by a brand new toxic chemical. Prior to the existence of this new trait, there can be no letter combination that codes for it, that is, there can be no 'word' for it, because it simply does not exist. Writing a random string of chemical symbols on a blackboard, or introducing a random string of nucleotides into its genome, will not make it a semiotic reality, let alone an organismic reality.\n \n In short, 'point mutations' correlate to letter changes, wherein changed letters are said to correlate to new words with new meanings, i.e., new traits.\n \n They are not to be confused with organismic trait changes, such as the extension of the giraffe's neck, where there are no 'letter' changes, and no 'new words' [neologisms] are needed to evolve a newly distinctive trait. Just as no 'neologisms' are necessary to the writing of another mystery novel. \n \n To add to the confusion, there is the third issue you introduce, that of 'intelligent design', aka 'genetic engineering', aka, 'gene-splicing', aka 'artificial evolution', wherebye a known 'gene', corresponding to a 'word' or even a 'sentence', or possibly an entire 'cook book', is, with much effort, will, and ingenuity, inserted into the idiosyncrasy of eubacteria plasmid DNA, so that a foreign substance, [say, human insulin] will be mechanically generated by the genetically modified cell and its cloned descendents. A special case for some special pleading, wrt your 'novel adaptive traits determined by novel, randomly constructed, nucleotide chains' hypothesis. To which, quite obviously, there is no true and valid analogy with this, 'gene-splicing', [or 'word/book insertion'], whatsoever.\n \n And so, wrt to your objection here, the fact is that for new traits, new 'words' are sometimes necessary in order to describe them, but usually not. Just as I clearly stated at the start of this exchange of posts on the issue. \n But your 'point mutations' entail new 'words', by their very nature, [i.e., they are 'new letter combinations'] just as soon as they correlate, symbolically, to an organismic 'trait', [be it a brand new trait, or just a new 'word' for an 'old' trait--remember, different 'genes' can and do sometimes 'code' for the same 'trait'], but they are not 'new words' until they correlate to a particular 'trait'. Before they correlate, they do nothing, and, in effect, are nothing, because they mean nothing,-- because they stand for, signify, nothing. Nothing that actually exists. And that is the focus of this particular issue, which is not the issue of the evolution of distinctive new traits in general. When you try to expand the idiosyncrasy of 'point mutations' and 'gene-splicing' into a general rule, i.e., 'RM+NS=Evolution [of distinctive new traits], then you, as I said earlier, are prevaricating.\n \n Break time.",

I'm only a layman, an armchair philosopher, not a geneticist, nor even a semiotician. As far as I can tell, 'nucleotides' are not the same thing as 'the four basic elements of DNA', [G,A,C, & T],but rather, are other, greater, things that have been constructed using these four as as 'building material', and that 'codons' are still greater things [different DNA molecules] made of 3 nucleotides linked together. Maybe it takes only one 'codon' [if that means codon=complete DNA molecule?]to make a 'gene', maybe it takes a dozen, or maybe it can take any number from 1 to a million; how would I know, since \"gene\" is still undefined? And maybe it only takes one DNA molecule/codon to signify a trait, or maybe it takes a million of them, and it takes the entire million to make up a single 'gene', where 'gene' equates to all of the information required to construct a given 'trait'? Who knows, since \"gene\" is carefully nebulous, vague, imprecise, equivocal, and indefinite?\n \n But in semiotic terms, I could say that perhaps the four basic elements, [GACT] are merely 'glyphs', or 'marks', like /, I, -, (, and that their job is to serve as the 'building blocks' of 'letters', which in turn serve as the construction material for 'words', which in turn serve as the construction material for 'messages'. From that POV, the 4 elements are like 'glyphs', i.e., simple physical marks, which when systematically arranged form 'nucleotides', analogous to 'letter' symbols, and these when themselves systematically arranged, form 'codons', which are analogous to 'word' symbols, which when, in their turn, are systematically arranged in the genome as 'genes', are analogous to 'sentence' symbols. I don't know if that's how it is, but it's another way of looking at it.\n \n I am only trying to understand what geneticists are talking about. I am not dictating to anyone. If the genetic code is a code [chemist, true-blue materialist that he is, says it is not a 'code', not at all, but just a bunch of chemicals found in the same place, so that they bang into one another], then let's discover how it acts as a semiotic entity. If you agree with chemist, then we first need to establish whether the genome is a semiotic 'information processing' system, as I have been given to believe, or rather, a physical, mechanical, thermodynamic system, as chemist [and perhaps yourself?] understands it to be.

   "\n A point mutation, while most do change only a letter, inevitably alters the codon of which they are a part to a different but still meaningful word.\n\n \n **\n Are you saying that there are only so many 'codons' in existence, therefore any nucleotide change [point mutation]can never generate a new codon, but only revise one established codon into another established codon? If that were true, then there could only be as many 'traits' in the world as there are codons, UNLESS the 'codon' is NOT the 'message'. i.e., the 'codon' is not the 'gene', OR, it takes more than one 'gene' to make a 'message' to make a trait. This indefinite 'gene' thing really gets in the way of any understanding.:(\n \n \n\n Single point insertions or deletions can cause a 'frameshift', where the triplets are shifted by one, eg:\n \n TTTAAAGGG -< ATTTAAAGGG\n \n These cause a wholesale change to the 'sentence' the gene represents, and as you would expect aren't often anything but destructive. However, one such frameshift did give the nylon-eating bug its altered palette.\n\n \n **\n I have always said that there is often a correlation between a novel organismic trait, such as the ability to digest nylon, and some particular 'gene'. [Is a 'gene' simply a 'codon', or something more than a 'codon'.] But unlike yourself, I do not suppose that correlation equals causation. IOW, I do not leap to the assumption that if bacteria can now metabolize nylon, that this is the mechanical result of an accidental, random 'frameshift', or 'point mutation', that 'spontaneously generated' itself in a 'codon', that deterministically generated a mechanical process that culminated in the 'trait'. I prefer the more rational assumption that starving bacteria, surrounded by nylon, kept on trying to metabolize nylon, got better and better at it, and then purposefully revised their genome to reflect this new, organically, teleologically developed, organismically adaptive, trait. You believe that the gene mutation arose, by random chance, before the organismic trait mutation. I believe that the adaptive trait mutation developed in the organism, teleologically, prior to being incorporated, by it, into its genome, for posterity. IOW, it's RMNS vs. EAM.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n However, in the case of 'traits', usually the replication of any given trait requires not just a change in a 'word', but a change in a systematic combination of words, i.e., a 'sentence', or even several 'sentences', making up a complex _set_ of 'instructions'. In such cases your 'random accident spontaneously generating novel information deterministically/mechanically leading to a novel trait' becomes patently absurd. \n \n \n Why are you dredging this up again? Empirically, novel traits are found to be 'encoded' as single point mutations within a gene, so absurd or not it does happen. Don't argue with me, argue with the bacteria!\n\n \n **\n When you stop trying to equivocate what happens in the idiosyncrasy of eubacterial plasmid DNA with what happens in the rest of the biosphere's chromosomal DNA, then I'll stop \"dredging this up again\".\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Which is why you are 'betting your farm' on the 'point mutations', i.e., single nucleotide insertions, deletions, and/or duplications, in the idiosyncratic plasmid DNA of eubacteria.

IO was adressing readers who may not be aware, and thus be undeservedly impressed by your argument.\n \n \n\n And no, I'm not just talking about plasmid DNA, although for some reason you always seem to forget and go back to assuming I am, no matter how many times I supply examples of chromosomal DNA changes.\n\n \n **\n What examples of \"chromsomal gene changes\"?!? Every example you've supplied in this thread has had to do with either antibacterial resistance [natural change in plasmid dna], or 'gene-splicing', [artificial insertion into plasmid dna]. Even the nylon-metabolizing trait, is connected to plasmid, not chromosomal, dna, [as best I remember]. Not that that makes any difference to the main point in that instance, which is, that the 'frameshift' involved, be it in chromosomal or in plasmid eubacteria dna, was not the assumed, 'spontaneous accident' of darwinism, but the systematic, teleological product of an organism trying to survive in a particular environment.\n \n If you want to bring yeast or any other simple eukaryote into this discussion in order to serve as an 'example' of support for your 'point mutation' argument, feel free to do so.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n But there is no rational reason to believe that any change in the letters of an established word must necessarily generate a another, [but equally established and accepted], word, \n \n Yes there is, when the 'words' are codons, all of which are meaningful.\n\n \n **\n See above. If 'codons' constituted 'the trait', then there could only be as many traits in the biosphere as there are codons in the biosphere. Obviously there is no one-to-one mapping of any particular 'codon' to any particular 'trait'. IMHO, if your each 'codon' is analogous to a single 'word', then the biosphere has too limited a vocabulary to express all the information that it does express. A lot of biological information, as expressed in organisms, must come from something other than 'codons'. Either that, or every 'codon' must contain a multitude of 'meanings', which are 'parsed' by something other than the 'codon' itself.

The discrete environmental factors that impact these goals are only relative and local. The criteria for 'productivity' never change, and so the axiom is universally applicable. Organisms that are doing well in terms of surviving, thriving, and, to an extent, reproducing, are productive no matter what the environment involved. Organisms that arre not doing well in those terms are not productive, or at least, not as productive as they might wish to be, no matter what the environment involved.\n \n So yes, 'productivity' is impacted by the environment, but in the end, 'productivity' depends upon the organism and its ability to deal with its environment, and not the environment itself. This view is quite different from the materialist view, in which organisms are but passive pawns that arise and fall, deterministically or luckily, according to the whims of random environmental change.\n \n \n\n or how it would be violated anyway given that mutations empirically can and do occur prior to the environment in which they confer an advantage.\n\n \n **\n You keep saying that, without ever proving that it's true!! We've been all over L&D'43 and L&L'51 wrt to this claim, ithas been shown to be false in those two overworked and outdated cases, but still you persist!\n \n \n\n Your axiom wouldn't know where to start. \"Hmm, ok, you're a harmful mutation, you can happen. Oh ####, the environment's changed and you're a useful mutation! I take it back, you can't have happened!\"\n\n \n **\n Groan. Now you're starting to sound like the other dittoheads do. This isn't reasoning, it's intellectual junk.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n IOW, you are finally admitting to the materialist belief that the genetic code is not a code at all, \n \n \n Please don't twist what I said. I clearly stated that DNA could be both symbolic and, through the physical proteins it directly and unambiguously describes, provide chemically active 'tools'.\n\n \n **\n Well, that sounds like waffling to me. If a thing is a semiotic symbol, then it is something that stands for something else. It is not that, 'something else', and it is not both itself and that 'something else' at the same time. Here is an example. A locked door is not a 'symbol', it is a physical barrier. A sign saying, 'Do Not Enter\" is a symbol, but not a physical barrier. Neither are both physical barriers and semiotic symbols. WRT the genetic code, it is one or the other, physical and mechanical, or semiotic and psychical, it cannot be both.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Yeah, right. In a discussiomn of what 'genes' can or cannot do, it's a 'red herring' to demand a cogent definition of what a 'gene' is. Duh! \n \n \n No duh, just logic so simple it borders on the trivial. If we want to know whether the emergence of the gene itself, via RM, is sufficient for the trait to be expressed, we need only establish that no other novel, trait-specific contextual changes to the organism are required. Whatever the gene is, whatever it represents, whatever symbolism and tools are contained therein, if no other trait-specific info is needed then the origination of the gene via RM will result in the trait being expressed.\n\n \n **\n Well here's a taste of real logic. If set \"A\" is called a \"gene\", but the contents of set \"A\" are unknown [because 'gene' is undefined], then it is impossible to say whether or not any \"trait specific contextual changes\" exist outside of that set, simply because you do not know what \"trait specific contextual changes\" are included in that set!!! There may be none, there may be a whole big bunch, but until such time as you specify which are in, you cannot specify which are out.\n \n And while you're at it, you might want to clarify exactly what you mean by \"trait specific contextual changes\" and how they are contained in a 'gene'.\n \n \n\n Quote:ww\n \"What I am doing is making one solitary pronouncement on what 'random chance' can or cannot do, and that is, 'ex nihilo, ab nihilo, nihil fit'. You cannot get something from nothing. Included in that is the fact that you cannot get increased productivity into a system out of thin air, by spontaneous generation. \n \n \n What I'm challenging is your assumption that 'increased productivity', especially when that can entail completely different and even conflicting things in a changing environment,\n\n \n **\n But that is where you go wrong. As above, a biosystem's 'productivity' is decided by an inflexible criterion, the achievement of its universal goals; survive, thrive, and maybe reproduce. Not by the local environmental circumstances that test that criterion. That is the difference between the scientific universality of EAM and the unscientific, local relativity of \"Natural Selection\".\n \n \n\n falls within the remit of that axiom. You've never been able to explain how it can apply when the traits that lead to increased productivity in one environment can be detrimental in another,\n\n \n **\n As above. Evolution is not about the trait, and it's not about the environment; it's about the organism's ability to alter its traits in keeping with changing environments so as to achieve the 'life goals',-- survive, thrive, and, sometimes, reproduce. Its, 'productivity level', in that regard. And that is why increased productivity never arises in a complex system by accident, 'creatio ex nihilo, ab nihilo'; that is, by a 'random' _internal_ change to the system itself, such as a random genetic mutation.

But as I have shown, you cannot have your cake and eat it on this one. DNA is either semiotic, or mechanical. A sign can never be the same thing that it signifies. Chemist says its strictly mechanical; the materialist POV. That's at least clear, unequivocal, and straightforward. I say that it is semiotic, that is, psychically informational, not physically mechanical. And logic says that it cannot be both. So pick one or the other, or stop complaining when I point out what you're doing. Which is prevaricating and equivocating.\n \n And yes, prevarication/equivocation does come awfully close to the \"L\" word.\n I would never accuse you of an outright lie, because I believe you to be, from my experience of you, a person of true integrity. But I think that some confusion and uncertainty on this issue is leading you astray, and muddying the waters.\n \n \n\n All I've said is that one can describe a novel design using a novel configuration of existing symbols. You brought up books and bridge designs, both of which directly support my hypothesis.\n\n \n **\n But do not 'support' your 'point mutations', nor any 'random' mutations in chromosomal dna, that can be shown to determine the kind of totally novel trait, [as opposed to the partial modification of an established trait], such as \n you appeal to wrt eubacteria. Another bridge is not the first bridge, but eating nylon is a definite first.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Always necessary to what? To the replication of that trait? Yes. \n \n \n Ok, great. So if I can show an example that contradicts your claim, a case where no trait-specific information is required to be transferred except the gene itself,\n\n \n **\n Again,you simply cannot do that until you have defined 'gene', therebye limiting the \"trait-specific information\" it does contain, so that we can then know what \"trait-specific information\", if any, that it does not contain.\n \n Now, if all the information necessary to a specific trait can be summed up in a single specific codon, which I understand to be the word for a DNA molecule, and you can place that molecule into a broth of all the chemicals it needs to get the ball rolling inevitably toward an inevitable end, i.e., that trait, then you will have shown that a codon contains all the 'trait-specific information' required for the formation and production of that trait. But both you and I know that that cannot be done. A petri dish full of the requisite chemicals simply cannot do what a live organism does with those same chemicals. So what's missing from this picture?\n \n \n\n then I've shown a situation where the RM origin of the gene would successfully masquerade as the inheritance of an intentionally encoded gene, yes?\n\n \n **\n Only where the \"intentionally encoded gene\" already existed. And it couldn't exist as an 'encoded gene', until after the trait existed that it could be encoded for. Any \"RM\" codon, or whatever, could not 'masquerade' as anything, if the thing it supposedly masquerades as, does not, in fact, already exist.\n \n \n\n The organism receiving such a gene would 'believe' it was inheriting an encoded trait, and since no information would be missing, it would follow the instructions and thus end up expressing the trait the gene appeared to encode.\n\n \n **\n And I've already agreed, a dozen times, that if by random accident a \"gene\" arose that was identical to an established \"gene\", then the organism would interpret it in the same fashion. However, since we still have not unequivocally established just what a \"gene\" is, and what it is not, talking about \"identical genes\", and claiming that they can arise by accident, is purely speculative.\n \n \n\n Just like if you were handed a recipe with a typesetting error: if it only represents a novel combination of ingredients and not an ingredient you don't recognise, you would follow the instructions and end up with the dish the recipe appeared to encode, even though it had never before been cooked.\n\n \n **\n Not if it calls for an ingredient that doesn't exist. But even supposing the random mistake simply changed quantities of ingredients, it would have to change a lot of them, or change one great deal, or add or subtract a very robust ingredient, before we got more than a slightly altered version of the same dish. What are the odds of that happening, even with something so simple as a recipe, without 'the cook' noticing, and altering his behaviour accordingly?\n \n The only place where your analogy works is with a machine that must passively, automatically, do whatever it is 'programmed' to do. If you wish to take the materialist view that living organisms are all passive automatons, machines that must do whatever their genes and their environment dictate to them. Such that, for instance, a 'baker' is neither more nor less than a modern, automated bread-making machine, then your analogy with random genetic mutations holds firm. Otherwise, not so much.",

   "Wow, this got unmanageable awfully quickly! Time to condense things down; let me know if I miss something.\n \n As regards 'who said what' about new symbols/words etc - forget it; it's not worth arguing about.\n \n As for nucleotides, genes and codons, it's useful to think of a gene as a start/stop terminated string of codons, each codon being a 'three letter word'.\n \n Concerning the origin of bridges:\n \n You are quite right that something had to exist (physically or as a design) before the word 'bridge' could be meaningful. But you're making the assumption that a gene is akin to the word 'bridge', rather than being akin to instructions for making one.\n \n Those instructions may still be symbolic, but they can be general-purpose (plank here, nail here). Novel combinations of existing instructions can give rise to modified structures. But is a 'modified' structure a 'novel' one? This brings us to:\n \n Concerning the proposed 'two kinds' of trait changes:\n \n Here your usage of the term 'novel' seems to get a little hazy - pretty much mutable according to the needs of your hypothesis :) Now a longer neck isn't 'novel', even though it might never have happened before, while antibiotic resistance, though it may in physical terms involve only a slight deformation of a receptor which denies the antibiotic access to the cell interior, is novel.\n \n It's this fast-and-loose treatment of 'novelty' that's allowing you to get away with your false discrimination. The nylon-eating bug is the clearest example of novelty, and the mutation there was a frame shift: an alteration of an existing gene. A radical alteration, to be sure, but a modification nonetheless.\n \n Now, if you're right and the whole of a gene constitutes a word, in itself signifying nothing, why would the organism need to make such a substantial alteration to the gene (only a single point insertion in nucleotide terms, but a wholesale re-write in terms of the codon triplets they form) in order to write that word down? Surely if all the hard 'trait' work is performed elsewhere, it could have indexed it with a minor change to just one codon!\n \nI do not leap to the assumption that if bacteria can now metabolize nylon, that this is the mechanical result of an accidental, random 'frameshift', or 'point mutation', that 'spontaneously generated' itself in a 'codon', that deterministically generated a mechanical process that culminated in the 'trait'. I prefer the more rational assumption that starving bacteria, surrounded by nylon, kept on trying to metabolize nylon, got better and better at it, and then purposefully revised their genome to reflect this new, organically, teleologically developed, organismically adaptive, trait.\n\n The new gene codes for an enzyme that chemically breaks down the bonds in nylon and frees up the carbon it contains. It's an example of a gene describing a 'tool'. It's impossible for the bacterium to process the nylon without it. There's nothing rational about pretending otherwise - as I think you belatedly realised ;)\n \n Concerning plasmids:\n \n Let's get this straight once and for all: neither the adaptive mutations I've linked you to over the months, nor the practice of gene splicing, are confined to plasmid DNA. Why you think they are, I don't know. It's certainly more convenient to splice dna via plasmids, but it's not the only way of doing it.\n \n Here, for example, is a response by biochemists debunking the 'hypermutational response' hypothesis. They repeated the experiment with the lac- gene at 34 different places within the chromosome, and found exactly the same revertant rate (per lac- gene) occurred as with the gene in a plasmid. \n \n The only difference is that the plasmid in question happens to have DNA ends that promote unstable duplication. Duplication of the lac- gene (again, necessarily prior to the selective environment being imposed otherwise the bacterium wouldn't be able to do anything at all) was a slight benefit in that it allowed the organism to process lactose, albeit inefficiently, and continue to grow/divide. Those with more duplicates grew quicker, and spawned offspring with a chance of even more duplicates, etc. And since every lac- gene is a potential target for reversion, the chances of any one bacteria reverting by chance got higher and higher.\n \n Further muddying the waters was the fact that in around 10% of the bacteria a mutation-promoting gene was also located on the same plasmid, which got duplicated along with the lac- gene. Again, each duplication amplified the effect, until when the dust settled it looked like 10% of the population had hypermutated their F' plasmid in an attempt to revert, a reversal of the actual cause and effect. Hence the erroneous hypotheses of hypermutation as a eusocial bacterial response to stress.\n \n Concerning Ex Nihilo and the occurrence of mutations in the absence of the environment to which they are adaptive:\n \n Our conversation about this keeps following the same pattern:\n \n P: Mutations occur in the absence of the environment to which they are adaptive, and hence cannot violate your axiom (assuming it applied at all).\n WW: No they don't!\n P: Here are links to repeatable experiments proving that it happens.\n WW: That's not the RM origin of a trait, just the RM re-expression of a trait that was long ago intelligently designed.\n P: How do you know?\n WW: Because of my axiom: RM can't produce adaptive novelty. Ex nihilo and all that.\n P: But the mutations occur in the absence of the environment to which they are adaptive, and hence cannot violate your axiom (assuming it applied at all).\n WW: No they don't!\n ...and so on.\n \n The point is, your axiom is of no help to you in our present discussion concerning whether novel variant genes can lead to novel traits, because there's no suggestion that these novel traits are necessarily helpful in the current environment. Every time you say 'that can't happen because RM can't improve productivity: ex nihilo, nihil fit', I'll just shrug and say 'who ever said this was a helpful trait? I'm talking about this mutation occurring in an environment where the trait is neutral or harmful'.\n \n So what else have you got?\n \n Regarding the symbolic or mechanical nature of DNA:\n \n \nChemist says its strictly mechanical; the materialist POV. That's at least clear, unequivocal, and straightforward. I say that it is semiotic, that is, psychically informational, not physically mechanical. And logic says that it cannot be both.\n\n \n Logic says no such thing. Sure, a door and a no entry sign are not the same thing - but what about a door with instructions on it saying where it should be placed? Purely informational? Purely mechanical? What about a key with a house number carved on it?\n \n I'm not trying to be evasive, I genuinely think you're wrong to try and pigeonhole genes as one thing or the other. \n \n However, for the purposes of this argument I'm happy to talk about genes being informational. After all, they contain start and stop codons, which are symbolic, and codons describing amino acids. What I'm not prepared to accept as a given is that a gene as a whole is one big symbol.\n \n Regarding the requirement to know what is 'in' a gene:\n \n \nWell here's a taste of real logic. If set \"A\" is called a \"gene\", but the contents of set \"A\" are unknown [because 'gene' is undefined], then it is impossible to say whether or not any \"trait specific contextual changes\" exist outside of that set, simply because you do not know what \"trait specific contextual changes\" are included in that set!!!\n\n \n I fear your logic has failed you. There is a perfectly straightforward way of determining whether a gene contains all the trait specific information required, and that is to transfer the gene to an organism which cannot ever have exhibited that trait before and thus cannot bring anything 'trait specific' to the party. We can thus establish that the gene contains all that is necessary without ever knowing what that might actually be.\n \n And finally:\n \n \nBut even supposing the random mistake simply changed quantities of ingredients, it would have to change a lot of them, or change one great deal, or add or subtract a very robust ingredient, before we got more than a slightly altered version of the same dish. What are the odds of that happening, even with something so simple as a recipe, without 'the cook' noticing, and altering his behaviour accordingly?\n\n \n Can you spot the mistake in your reasoning there? Here it is again:\n \n \nwithout 'the cook' noticing,\n\n \n You're assuming 'the cook' already knows the 'correct' recipe. This is not the case either in the analogy I made, where you were handed a recipe, nor in the case of inheritance, where offspring are handed a genome.\n \n \nThe only place where your analogy works is with a machine that must passively, automatically, do whatever it is 'programmed' to do.\n\n \n Or with a teleological organism that only has its DNA to go on, as far as the info in that DNA is concerned. I'm sure you wouldn't describe yourself as a passive, programmed machine - yet you would still follow a recipe in good faith, were it handed to you.\n \n Most novel traits are only minor differences. Even things like the nylon-digesting enzyme turn out to be only a minor (nucleotide) change which made a big (genetic) difference.",

Don't you just wish that you had never opened it?\n \n \n\n As for nucleotides, genes and codons, it's useful to think of a gene as a start/stop terminated string of codons, each codon being a 'three letter word'.\n \n\n \n **\n I'll take this as meaning that you have finally granted the necessity for an unequivocal definition of the word, 'gene', and that you have opted for a strictly physical, chemical, molecular definition; that being that a 'gene' is a discrete string of contiguous codons, where the different codons in that sequence are arranged differently and distinctively for each 'gene', and each codon is made of three nucleotides that are differently arranged in each codon. [The different chemical/molecular arrangements making up different nucleotides depending largely upon the presence, quantity, and spacial arrangement of the 4 basic molecules, I suppose?] \n \n In short, your 'gene' is a distinct sequence of codons. This is close to the standard dictionary definition, save only that you say nothing of any relation to organismic traits, [which is kind of the whole point of the thing, here]. You have defined a 'gene' as no more nor less than a distint aggregation of particular chemical elements, i.e., 'bits of stuff', without placing this 'gene' in any context, physical or functional. IOW, this is the definition that I would have expected from any strict materialist, including chemist, Dawkins, Dennett, Sober, et al. But at least we all now know what you mean when you use the word, and have only to catch you out implying more or imputing more to the phenomenon than your definition allows. Unless you'd rather revise and expand it? \n \n \n\n Concerning the origin of bridges:\n \n You are quite right that something had to exist (physically or as a design) before the word 'bridge' could be meaningful. But you're making the assumption that a gene is akin to the word 'bridge', rather than being akin to instructions for making one.\n\n \n **\n I am making no assumptions about 'genes' whatsoever, since until just now you have avoided establishing any definition for the word. All I have done is offer semiotic analogies from 'language' in the search for the best analogy to what really constitutes the 'genetic code', assuming that it is a 'code', and not just a specified aggregation of particular molecules, as you have now defined it to be. That is, 'gene' defined strictly in terms of its own physical content, without any reference to its relationship with the rest of the world.\n \n Under that definition, I submit, a 'gene' cannot be \"akin to the word, 'bridge'\", at all. Nor any other word. Nor even any other thing, 'bridges' included. Because your current definition isolates them from everything that they are not, without coming to grips with their connection to anything else. Which, in fact, is the only thing that matters in biology.\n \n IAC, I do not suppose that a 'gene' is akin to a 'word', but to a 'message'; and whether that 'message' requires only one word or ten thousand words for full and meaningful expression would, I suppose, depend upon subject matter.\n \n Frankly, since you have now defined 'gene' as solely a 'substance', that is, not even as a 'medium' for transporting a 'message', I cannot see how we can continue in this vein, since you are now imputing much more to 'gene' than your current definition allows. I'll wait for you to revise and expand that definition so that we can continue speaking of genes in semiotic terms, or start speaking of them in strictly chemical terms.",

   "I'll take this as meaning that you have finally granted the necessity for an unequivocal definition of the word, 'gene', and that you have opted for a strictly physical, chemical, molecular definition;\n\n \n Such genes as are translated via mRNA into proteins do so via an empirically established coding system of nucleotide triplets. The triplets themselves are not the amino acids; they symbolically represent them within the context of the surrounding developmental machinery. Such genes are therefore symbolic instructions for the construction of a protein. \n \n Clearly I am not saying that the medium 'is' the message. Even when fulfiling its most direct function of describing the construction of proteins, DNA is symbolic.\n \n With that out of the way, can we return to the meat (sorry) of the issue? IIRC, it hinges on whether your characterisation of the 'syntax' of DNA is correct: you contend that a novel gene is akin to a new 'word' in the language of DNA, with the logical corollary that meaning must be assigned to that 'word' before it can be decoded into a trait. This being the case, the trait must be the precursor of the gene rather than the other way around.\n \n While I cannot exclude the possibility that this is sometimes true, I have pointed out that there is an empirically established, general-purpose syntax employed in the decoding of certain genes into proteins. Here, the nucleotide 'alphabet' and codon 'vocabulary' are limited in scope, with the true open-ended potential for variation lying in the protein-coding 'sentences' (and beyond that, the nigh-on-infinite recombinant possibilities of many different proteins).\n \n In such cases, random point mutations (alterations to a nucleotide or the insertion or deletion of a nucleotide), can to a greater or lesser extent rewrite the protein-coding 'sentence'. I've also provided an example of just such a rewrite: the novel nylon-digesting enzyme encoded by a frameshifted gene in certain bacteria. This is a cut-and-dried example of a genetic mutation altering the symbolism of a gene*, leading to the construction of a novel enzyme which catalyses the breakdown of nylon waste products.\n \n It's a bit of a strain to try and square this away with your metaphysic. You could, I suppose, claim that the bacterium came up with the protein first and then reverse-engineered the gene for it, but:\n \n 1. That's just speculation, and in no way disqualifies the altered gene from in fact being of RM origin.\n \n 2. It doesn't explain why the bacteria would corrupt the existing gene and thus throw away the ability to synthesise a perfectly servicable enzyme, rather than just adding a new gene.\n \n 3. Although the altered gene is only one nucleotide different, the frameshift makes the protein it codes for unrecognisable. Given that there are many, many enzyme variations that could potentially digest nylon, the idea that the bacterium somehow managed to come up with one that coincidentally just happened to reverse-engineer into a frameshifted version of the original gene is... well, it's a bit of a stretch.\n \n * Indeed, the effects of an insertion mutation directly prove that genes in 'my' model are symbolic. Nucleotides are not physically grouped into threes; rather they are 'read out' three at a time. This means that any one nucleotide could find itself forming part of any of three codons, depending upon how many nucleotides precede it in the gene - which makes them clearly and unambiguously symbolic.",

Therefore, if a 'gene' is nothing more than DNA molecules, then DNA is not the message used by something that isn't that DNA to build something else that is not that DNA. If the information encoded in the DNA is 'the gene', that's a whole different thing. If that information is not 'the gene', as appears to be the current view, then the 'gene' is utterly disconnected from 'the trait', and is nothing but 'raw material' used by something that can read and write information, symbolically, to 'store and transport' information geographically, from point 'a' to point 'b'.

   "\n Absolutely - but the 'medium' of a message comprises both the paper and the ink. The phosphate and sugar 'backbone' of DNA is the 'paper', and the 'bases' are the ink. The message is not the paper or the ink, but in the pattern of the ink, yes? \n\n \n **\n Precisely. And it is the message that matters here, not the molecules. So discussing evolution in terms of molecules instead of messages, information, is a waste of time.\n \n \n\n And we can clearly see, in the case of genes that encode proteins, how groups of three nucleotide 'symbols' are read and interpreted by the developmental machinery. \n\n \n **\n So what? We can clearly see how printing presses combine paper and ink to produce newspapers, but that tells us nothing about the information in those papers, what it is, where it came from, who put it there, who's reading it, or even, who designed and built 'the code' itself, or even the machinery for putting paper and ink together in such fashion that information can be encoded, then attached to this particular medium for storage and transportation from one physical point to another. \n \n And just what is this \"developmental machinery\" that you claim reads and interprets the code? 'Who' built it, and 'who' does it work for? A bunch of molecules? I use this word to emphasize the difference between a 'who' and a 'what', knowing full well that to a materialist there are no 'who's', but only 'whats', in their universe.\n \n \n\n It's a symbolic code,\n\n \n **\n There is a symbolic code there, but the code is NOT the molecules. It is the _interrelationship_ of the molecules with each other that is the code. Just as information is NOT data, but the interrelationship that lies between different bits of data. That is,-- form, pattern, design, configuration. Terms that refer to an intangible, psychical reality, not tangible molecules, i.e., 'bits of stuff'.\n \n \n\n dependent upon the 'understanding' of the developmental machinery for its meaning, just like you said.\n\n \n **\n Actually the word I used was \"organism\", not \"developmental machinery\". To me an organism is not a piece of developmental machinery, but that which designs, builds, and employs chemical machinery in order to achieve its own ends.\n \n \n\n Why are you suddenly so averse to the concept?\n\n \n **\n I haven't changed my mind at all; I'm simply averse to your misinterpretation of what I've been saying all along. The concept I am averse to is yours, not mine, and has been for ages, it seems.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Well, as I've just said, I do not see where anything has changed. I do not agree that 'dna is symbolic'. It simply is not, anymore than a piece of wood is symbolic, unless and until it forms a 'cross', or whatever. \n \n \n Are you saying that nucleotide triplets aren't symbols interpreted by the organism in the construction of proteins?\n\n \n **\n I am saying that 'nucleotide triplets' [aka, dna molecules, 'genes'], are NOT symbols,-- they are the physical materials used to express symbols. That is, they themselves are not 'symbolic', as you put it, but rather, that their _configurations_, i.e., designs, are symbolic. And that these designs, this symbolism, this code, is an artefact, an instrument, an implement, a devised agency, a tool, a deliberate creation, that stores and conveys intangible information via a tangible medium. And that is what I have been saying all along, but is NOT what you have just finished saying. \n \n \n\n That's a pretty big claim, given that we can get bacteria to produce any protein we like (even ones of our own design) by splicing the appropriate terminated strings of nucleotide triplets into their genome.\n\n \n **\n Talking of big claims, this one is a doozy!! Even apart from the fact that eubacteria have created special molecular machinery [separate cell plasmids with non-chromosomal dna], that other organisms don't have, in order to generate novel protein molecules for themselves, and that it is this idiosyncrasy that genetic engineers exploit to their ends, and this anomaly that darwinists exploit as support for their universal principle of evolution, i.e., RMNS.\n \n In any case it is the message encoded in the 'nucleotide triplets', along with the bacteria's intrinsic ability to read dna encoded information, and then assemble the appropriate protein, that matter here. You seem here to be implying the materialist [eg., chemist] notion that certain dna molecules chemically determine certain proteins, and that bacteria cells are machines, automatons, that can do nothing but what their molecules must do because 'natural laws', [whatever they are?!?], compel them to do everything they do, and prevent them from doing anytrhing else except whatever it is they do. Is that what you are saying? And if you are saying that that is the case with eubacteria, are you going on to say that that is the case for every organism in existence? And if you are not, then why bring it up?",

   "\n I'm not implying anything. I'm stating the empirically observed fact that all organisms ever studied - all organisms, not just bacteria - decode genes into proteins according to triplet codes of nucleotides.\n\n \n **\n And that is the point that you never seem to get. That organisms, and/or their cells, decode encoded _information_--NOT 'genes', if 'genes' are defined as dna molecules comprised of nucleotide triplets, and nothing more than just that. That's like saying that people read newspapers, with newspapers defined as pulp paper with ink stains on it. Particularly when you take into account, which you don't, that there are lots of dna molecule/nucleotide triplets out there that DO NOT translate into proteins in any organism/cell. And that alone puts your claim that any dna molecule/nucleotide triplet/'gene' inserted into a cell/organism's genome, even one invented 'from scratch' by some genetic engineer, will be translated into a protein by a cell/organism. Which still leaves us with the 'proteome' to get through before we get to 'traits', except in those special instances where the 'trait' is the direct chemical effect of a protein molecule. As in eubacteria.\n \n \n\n I'm not making any statements concerning how the codes were 'devised', 'who' did it, or 'who' they serve.\n\n \n **\n No, you are not. And that is exactly what you are doing wrong! Without statements that include those elements, you are explaining nothing.\n \n \n\n Now, will you please do me the courtesy of making a firm statement one way or another: do you agree that the symbolism employed by organisms in the translation of genes into proteins is as I describe it, or do you disagree? Thanks.\n\n \n **\n I simply do not know how to tell you any more clearly than I repeatedly have done, just how and where I disagree with your mechanical approach to heredity, developmentalism, and evolution, wrt exactly what a 'gene' is and what a 'gene' does. Either a 'gene' is only the 'bit of stuff' that you define it as, and DOES NOT do what you claim it does, or a 'gene' does what you claim it does, but IS NOT as you define it, but is much more than simply 'stuff'.\n I am inclined to say that your chemical, physical definition of 'gene' is the one in general usage, and we'll have to go with that. But in that case the 'gene' is NOT what is responsible for the generation, storage, and transmission of information in organisms. It is merely a tool used to store information. You do not reach an understanding of the existence of say, bookshelves, by dealing with them strictly in terms of hammers and nails and planks. Until you come to grips with the fact that you cannot reach an understanding, either of the inheritance, or the evolution, or the development of organismic traits, strictly by examining the chemistry of dna and proteins, but must come to grips with the psychical, non-physical elements involved in 'code', 'symbol', 'meaning', 'information', 'communication',\n 'comprehension', etc., you are just spinning your tires.\n \n \n\n Even if DNA and the coding system employed for reading it was 'devised', that doesn't change what will happen if RM alters the data the organism is reading.\n\n \n **\n No, it does not, but that is not the issue. The issue lies in the difference between what you claim 'will happen', and what I claim 'will happen', \"if RM alters the data the organism is reading\". You say a novel adaptive trait 'will \n happen'. I say that only a decrease in the adaptedness of an established trait 'will happen'. That's what we're debating here, and have been since word one.\n \n \n\n You can't hide behind claims that such random changes will be meaningless or not 'understood' by the organism, because all possible triplets (apart from the start and stop codons) symbolically represent amino acids in the language employed by the organism. \n\n \n **\n So what, if, as is the case, not all 'triplets', ['dna molecules', 'genes'], do not translate into proteins, let alone cellular and organic 'traits'? Your genetic determinism falls apart right there.\n \n \n\n So how about it: will the RM origination of a novel variant gene - which to the organism reading it will inevitably appear to be a readable, understandable 'sentence' of recognisable symbols - be decoded into a novel protein, such as the nylonase enzyme? Can you come up with a good reason why it won't?\n\n \n **\n First, no, it will not. Second, I've told you repeatedly why it will not. Thirdly, I've showed you why a randomly generated triplet does not automatically generate \"a readable, understanable 'sentence'\", that determines the generation of a 'trait', anymore than all the other non-coding 'genes' that are in the genome, [and they are the vast majority], automatically determine the generation of a 'trait'. \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Added in edit-- at-- http://www.physorg.com/news111947308.html\n \n \"Massive reanalysis of genome data solves case of the lethal genes\"\n \n \"It is better to be looked over than overlooked, Mae West supposedly said. These are words of wisdom for genome data-miners of today. Data that goes unnoticed, despite its widespread availability, can reveal extraordinary insights to the discerning eye. Such is the case of a systematic analysis by the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (DOE JGI) of the massive backlog of microbial genome sequences from the public databases. \n The survey identified genes that kill the bacteria employed in the sequencing process and throw a microbial wrench in the works. It also offers a possible strategy for the discovery of new antibiotics. These findings are published in the Oct. 19 edition of the journal Science. \n \n In nature, promiscuous microbes share genetic information so readily that using genes to infer their species position on the evolutionary tree of life was thought to be futile.[ Now, researchers at DOE JGI have characterized barriers to this gene transfer by identifying genes that kill the recipient bacterium upon transfer, regardless of the type of bacterial donor. These lethal genes also provide better reference points for building phylogenic trees-the means to verify evolutionary relationships between organisms. \n \n \"At DOE JGI, we are responsible for producing and making publicly available genomes from hundreds of different microbes, most of which are relevant to advancing the frontiers of bioenergy, carbon cycling, and bioremediation,\" said Eddy Rubin, DOE JGI Director. \"We realized that sequencing a genome is like conducting a massive experiment in gene transfer. By checking which genes could not be sequenced, we discovered barriers to transfer.\" \n \n The industrial-scale \"shotgun\" DNA sequencing strategy typically involves sheering the organism's DNA into manageable fragments, and then inserting these fragments into a disarmed strain of E. coli, which is used as an enrichment culture-to grow up vast amounts of the target DNA. The team led by Rubin showed that this sequencing process mimics the transmission of DNA from one organism to another, a mechanism called horizontal gene transfer. This phenomenon occurs in nature, allowing one organism to acquire and use genes from other organisms. While this is an extremely rare event in animals, it does occur frequently in microorganisms and is one of the main sources for the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance among bacteria. \n \n \"When you sequence a genome, you never get the whole genome reconstructed in one pass,\" said Rubin. \"You always get gaps in the assembly. This is annoying, expensive, and compels us to close the gaps and finish the puzzle so that we could tell the story behind the sequence. Our breakthrough was in understanding that gaps occur because some genes cannot be transferred to E. coli-because they are lethal.\" \n \n So Rubin and his colleagues sifted through more than nine billion nucleotides to assess gaps in 80 different genomes. They found that the same genes, over and over again, caused these gaps, meaning that they could not be transferred into the E. coli. \n \n \"We use the bits that people usually throw away, the gaps of information keeping us from finishing an assembly,\" Rubin said. \"We identified a set of genes that, if you add another copy or you tweak its expression, the host dies. \n \n \"The genes we categorized, while providing us a lesson in the evolutionary history of the organism, now suggest a short-cut for finishing genomes,\" Rubin said. \"In addition, it offers a new strategy for screening molecules that may represent the next generation of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We expect that many organisms, not just E. coli, are susceptible to being killed if they take up certain genes that are over-expressed. We have strong evidence that most microbes behave like that.\" [all bold mine--ww]\n \n at-- http://www.physorg.com/news111947308.html\n \n IOW, cutting up eubacteria cells and sticking genes in their plasmid dna does not is not the straightford mechanical process that you picture it as being, and that, \"the RM origination of a novel variant gene - which to the organism reading it will inevitably appear to be a readable, understandable 'sentence' of recognisable symbols - [will, must] be decoded into a novel protein, such as the nylonase enzyme\", is simply not the case. BTW, what's with the \"9 billion nucleotides\"?!? Seems to me your number of possible nucleotides was more in the order of '24', or '42', or something like. Although the exact figure you gave escapes me, it was many orders of magnitude fewer than '9,000,000,000'!",

Can you come up with a good reason why it won't?\n\n \n \nFirst, no, it will not. Second, I've told you repeatedly why it will not.\n\n \n I'm really sorry, but in all that's been said over the last few posts I can't seem to find anything that would serve as an explanation. What I mean to say is, no objections you've raised apply in this specific instance.\n \n First of all, your alleged 'universal principle' does not apply. The creation of the nylonase enzyme is not in absolute terms advantageous to the organism: nylon waste products must be present in order for the enzyme's chemical properties to be a net gain for the organism's ability to survive and thrive. So you can't be referring to your 'axiom' as a reason why the enzyme will not be produced.\n \n The other objections you've raised in have concerned 'meaning'. You've asserted that novel traits require novel 'words' to be added to the genetic language, words that would be meaningless if originated via RM. However, the nylonase gene does not require any novel 'words'. Both it, and the gene it is a mutation of, are in the same symbolic language, whose vocabulary is the 64 possible nucleotide triplets (4x4x4 = 64 permutations) which the organism decodes into the various amino acids.\n \n In your last post you've tried to say that not all triplets are decoded into proteins, which indicates I'm not the only one getting confused :) Let's recap:\n \n A triplet or 'codon' is three adjacent nucleotides as read from a strand of DNA by the organism. There are four different nucleotides, and thus 4x4x4 = 64 possible codons. In the standard code used by most organisms, one of those codons (AUG) is used to mean 'start creating a protein' and three others (UAG, UGA, UAA) are interpreted as 'stop'. All the triplets the organism encounters in between are interpreted as instructions to creaute one of the possible amino acids, which it strings together into a protein. There are no meaningless or untranslatable codons.\n \n It's true that a lot of DNA isn't translated into proteins, but that's not for any mysterious reason. The bits that aren't, aren't start/stop terminated, so the developmental apparatus doesn't translate them. Indeed, the disruption of a 'start' codon is one way a gene can be 'turned off'.\n \n Going back to the specific example of the nylonase gene, the frameshift mutation occurs after the 'start' codon, and so does not prevent the organism from creating a protein. And because all possible codons have a pre-established meaning to the organism, the organism can't 'get stuck' or 'not know what they mean'.\n \n So if your axiom cannot object, and no new semiotic meaning is required for the mutated gene to be translated into the nylonase enzyme, what exactly is your objection to RM-origination of the nylonase gene resulting in the production of the nylonase enzyme?\n \n We can go through it step by step if you like, and you can stop me when we reach something you believe 'can't happen'.\n \n 1. A random mutation occurs (say during cell division) resulting in a frameshift within a preexisting protein-encoding gene.\n \n 2. The inheriting organism reads the DNA and hits the 'start' codon, which has not been affected by the mutation.\n \n 3. The organism starts to construct a protein, translating each 'three letter word' in the DNA into an amino acid according to the same language it uses to translate every other protein-encoding gene. Although the frameshift has radically altered the 'sentence' (eg TTTAAAGGG... -< UTTTAAAGGG...) no new codon 'words' have been created: all 64 possible codons are already understood by the organism so it encounters no instructions it cannot follow.\n \n 4. The string of amino acids produced is what we call the nylonase enzyme.\n \n 5. The enzyme chemically breaks down any nylon waste products that happen to be around, liberating the raw materials for the organism to metabolise.\n \n I've scoured our recent correspondence again and again and I cannot find anything you've said that speaks to the impossibility of any of the above. If you believe otherwise, could you please explain, indicating which step in the above process cannot happen, and why?\n \n Thanks :) Sorry for being such a klutz.",

You have never given me any compelling reason to change my opinion.] It simply can't happen, not even is the 'special case' of eubacteria, where the idiosyncrasy of an internal cellular mechanism, i.e., plasmid DNA distinct from chromsomal DNA, allows that particular lifeform to do things wrt generating novel molecular traits [via HGT, duplication, accelerated mutation rates, etc.] that are not accessible to most other organisms, particularly wrt to macro-traits, i.e., extra-cellular organic traits, as contrasted with micro-traits, i.e., intra-cellular chemical/molecular traits.\n \n BTW, why is it that you never, ever, ever, acknowledge the fact that you are trying to build a supporting argument for your universal principle, [i.e., that adaptive traits, strictly coincidental to organismic need/goals, can and do arise unintentionally, by genetic accident], using this clear case of \"special pleading\"?!?! For those who may be unfamiliar with 'special pleading', it is an argument that focuses strictly upon an isolated, favourable aspect or instance of the general issue in question. As per wikipedia--\n \n \"special pleading \n Special pleading is a form of spurious argumentation where a position in a dispute introduces favorable details or excludes unfavorable details by alleging a need to apply additional considerations without proper criticism of these considerations themselves. Essentially, this involves someone attempting to cite something as an exemption to a generally accepted rule, principle, etc. without justifying the exemption.\n \n The lack of criticism may be a simple oversight (e.g., a reference to common sense) or an application of double standard.\n \n A more difficult case is when a possible criticism is made relatively immune to investigation. This immunity may take the forms of:\n \n \"reference to vocabulary that is owned by a distinct community with sole \n rights to assess meaning and application\" [this is not at issue here, but I bold it because darwinists appeal to their own Humpty Dumpty lexicon in every second argument, so I thought I'd bring attention to it--ww]\n \n \"unexplained claims of exemption from principles commonly thought relevant to the subject matter\"[such your claimed exemption from the exemption from the principle, 'ex nihilo, ab nihilo, nihil fit', wrt your 'accidental, random, chemical causation of increased organismic, systemic productivity, i.e.,adaptive traits--ww]\n \n Example: I'm not relying on faith in small probabilities here. These are slot machines, not roulette wheels. They are different.\n \n [quote]claims to data that are inherently unverifiable, perhaps because too remote or impossible to define clearly [/b] [such as RM-<adaptive trait]\n Example: Cocaine use should be legal. Like all drugs, it does have some adverse health effects, but cocaine is different from other drugs. Many have benefited from the effects of cocaine. \n \n [b]\"assertion that the opponent lacks the qualifications necessary to comprehend a point of view\" [typical darwinist argument, although not the case here]\n Example: I know you think that I should be giving my money to the poor, but you've never been rich before. There are things about wealth that you don't understand. \n \n \"assertion that literally nobody has the qualifications necessary to comprehend a point of view \n Example: I know the idea that ball lightning is caused by ghosts makes no sense to you, but that's only because you're human. Humans cannot understand supernatural phenomena.\"\n \n In the classic distinction among material, psychological, and logical fallacies,[1] special pleading most likely falls within the category of psychological fallacy, as it would seem to relate to \"lip service\", rationalization, and diversion (abandonment of discussion). Special pleading also often resembles the \"appeal to\" logical fallacies.\n \n In philosophy it is assumed that where a distinction is claimed a relevant basis for the distinction should exist and be substantiated. Special pleading is a subversion of this assumption.\n \n {I have shown the distinction that must be made between microbial lifeforms and all others. Ignoring this distinction in order to prove a general principle is 'special pleading'. This, and all bold, mine--ww}\n \n Getting back to my reasoning, again, it centres on the principle that nothing additive comes into existence, 'ex nihilo, ab nihilo'. This is prima facie truth. It is your responsibility to show that this not the actual case wrt adaptive traits arising out of accidental, non-systematic changes within a complex, productive system. As pointed out ad infinitum, the sole and only way you have of doing that is by taking an actual, empirically observwed case, and proving a/that the novel trait is additive, i.e., that it increases productivity in the biosystem wrt survival, well-being, and possibly reproduction, and,\n b/that that trait was the determined, mechanical result of a genetic alteration that arose spontaneously, by accident, [insofar as the organism is concerned].\n \n Instead, you focus on the anomalous idiosyncrasy --\n \n \"id\u00b7i\u00b7o\u00b7syn\u00b7cra\u00b7sy (&#301;d'&#275;-&#333;-s&#301;ng'kr&#601;-s&#275;) \n n., pl. -sies.\n A structural or behavioral characteristic peculiar to an individual or group.\n A physiological or temperamental peculiarity.\" [answers.com]\n \n --of eubacterial systems, and the attendent phenomenon of 'gene-splicing'.\n \n WRT to 'the nylon bug', the eubacterium's novel ability to digest nylonase is definitely acceptable as a novel adaptive trait. It fulfills condition a/. But there is absoluteley no reason whatsoever to assume that it fulfills condition b/,as above. Eubacteria have a special mechanism for generating novel chemico/genetic combinations in their plasmid dna, using hypermutation etc., in order to solve molecular problems, by systematically generating new 'genes' that directly generate new proteins, and the new protein IS the new trait/enzyme. This in no way violates the 'ex nihilo', but certainly is no case of 'spontaneous generation' via 'accidental' genetic mutation. In fact, the fact that the poor bacterium had been semi-starving, for many generations, in pools of indigestible nylonase, indicates rationally that the ability to improve their circumstances by altering their plasmid dna, [as eubacteria all do, in several ways], so as to generate a protein/enzyme that would allow metabolic nourishment from the previously indigestible nylon waste, clearly points to systemic endogenous adaptive mutagenesis, where vitality-<intelligence-<volition + chemical components-<novel adaptive trait.\n There is absolutely no rational, reason to accept your proposition i.e., that the absence, lack, lacune, non-existence, of order [i,e., randomness] 'spontaneously' 'just happened' to create it.\n \n Finally, your objection that a local example of an advantageous trait is not the universal principle that governs the generation of novelty in complex productive systems is simply illogical.\n \n \n\n The other objections you've raised in have concerned 'meaning'. You've asserted that novel traits require novel 'words' to be added to the genetic language, words that would be meaningless if originated via RM. However, the nylonase gene does not require any novel 'words'. Both it, and the gene it is a mutation of, are in the same symbolic language, whose vocabulary is the 64 possible nucleotide triplets (4x4x4 = 64 permutations) which the organism decodes into the various amino acids.\n\n \n **\n That's just more prima facie evidence that the generation of 'the nylonase gene' was not an 'accident'.\n \n \n\n In your last post you've tried to say that not all triplets are decoded into proteins, which indicates I'm not the only one getting confused :) Let's recap:\n \n A triplet or 'codon' is three adjacent nucleotides as read from a strand of DNA by the organism.

There are no meaningless or untranslatable codons.\n\n \n **\n Then why do some of them kill the host cell if inserted into the plasmid? See the material I edited into my last post, above. It would seem to me that anything that kills you is 'untranslatable', even if it is already a perfectly acceptable gene in another organism.\n \n \n\n It's true that a lot of DNA isn't translated into proteins, but that's not for any mysterious reason.\n\n \n **\n Who are you accusing of appealing to \"any mysterious reason\"?!?! You claimed that 'genes' mechanically 'translate' into proteins. I pointed out that some do, but most don't. Don't twist my words. If only some do, then their mere chemical conformation is not the key to the process, and all your details about codons and whatnot means nothing wrt the central issue.\n \n \n\n The bits that aren't, aren't start/stop terminated, so the developmental apparatus doesn't translate them. Indeed, the disruption of a 'start' codon is one way a gene can be 'turned off'.\n\n \n **\n The issue is that the chemicals are not what matters, and referring to the organismic intelligence that uses punction marks as well as words in its language as 'developmental apparatus', is just onemore materialist attempt to paint the organism as a mindless machine.\n \n \n\n Going back to the specific example of the nylonase gene, the frameshift mutation occurs after the 'start' codon, and so does not prevent the organism from creating a protein. And because all possible codons have a pre-established meaning to the organism, the organism can't 'get stuck' or 'not know what they mean'.\n\n \n **\n And that's no accident.

   "wabbit, I don't even know how to put this. \"Special pleading\"?! Peeling isn't taking one oddity and inflating it, he's disproving the assertion that you've said \"over and over again\" despite having no evidence to support it. Your model can't explain the nylon bug, and it can't explain the Lederberg experiment results, yet you claim that you have no reason to abandon it. You're full of ####.\n \n Ignore all this nonsense about code and symbols. In trying to come up with analogies and then work with analogies, you're taking the focus away from the actual topic. Maybe that's your intent, but focus on what's going on instead of sweating details of some bastardized simile. If you don't understand what's actually going on, then quit pretending that you do.\n \n Here's what you seem to be missing: We have no realistic way of testing for the arising of a gene besides phenotypic testing. That is, we could do base pair analysis of every single bacterium on a Lederberg experiment-like plate to see which ones have mutated to some sequence, but -- really -- do we have several hundred years to do this? (It would take a damn long time.) In many cases, how would we even know what sequence to look for? But in that instance, why can we discount other new sequences if we don't know their phenotypic effects?\n \n So, ultimately, you could say that there exists a measurement problem. We often can't recognize the mutation without exposing it to the environment. You say that the environment causes the mutations, and evil, close-minded Darwinists say that the environment selects out those unsuited. Of course, when I say that you \"could\" say that there's a measurement problem, that's assuming that there's no way to allow mutations to happen and then test for them.

   "\n 5. The enzyme chemically breaks down any nylon waste products that happen to be around, liberating the raw materials for the organism to metabolise.\n \n \n\n \n And the final outcome makes very good sense considering the similalrity of nylon to a polypeptide.\n \n \nNylons are condensation copolymers formed by reacting equal parts of a diamine and a dicarboxylic acid, so that peptide bonds form at both ends of each monomer in a process analogous to polypeptide biopolymers. The numerical suffix specifies the numbers of carbons donated by the monomers; the diamine first and the diacid second. The most common variant is nylon 6-6 which refers to the fact that the diamine (hexamethylene diamine) and the diacid (adipic acid) each donate 6 carbons to the polymer chain. As with other regular copolymers like polyesters and polyurethanes, the \"repeating unit\" consists of one of each monomer, so that they alternate in the chain. Since each monomer in this copolymer has the same reactive group on both ends, the direction of the amide bond reverses between each monomer, unlike natural polyamide proteins which have overall directionality: C terminal &#8594; N terminal. In the laboratory, nylon 6,6 can also be made using adipoyl chloride instead of adipic It is difficult to get the proportions exactly correct, and deviations can lead to chain termination at molecular weights less than a desirable 10,000 daltons (u). To overcome this problem, a crystalline, solid \"nylon salt\" can be formed at room temperature, using an exact 1:1 ratio of the acid and the base to neutralize each other. Heated to 285 \u00b0C, the salt reacts to form nylon polymer. Above 20,000 daltons, it is impossible to spin the chains into yarn, so to combat this, some acetic acid is added to react with a free amine end group during polymer elongation to limit the molecular weight. In practice, and especially for 6,6, the monomers are often combined in a water solution. The water used to make the solution is evaporated under controlled conditions, and the increasing concentration of \"salt\" is polymerized to the final molecular weight. \n\n \n Modification of the original enzyme to hydrolyze a new substrate is known in other arenas. Notably there is a company which offers bugs with various amino oxidases which provide the ability to remove one of the two enatiomers of various odd amino acids thus leaving the pure enatiomer of interest.",

   "[b]\"assertion that the opponent lacks the qualifications necessary to comprehend a point of view\" [typical darwinist argument, although not the case here]\n\n The assertion is nearly always that the opponent is self-evidently displaying a lack of the basic knowledge that is necessary to understand what they are arguing about. This is hugely different from what you just said. \n \n \n I have shown the distinction that must be made between microbial lifeforms and all others. Ignoring this distinction in order to prove a general principle is 'special pleading'. \n Since bacteria are the largest group on lifeforms on the planet, and the most metabolically diverse, arguing about what they can or cannot do does not seem like special pleading.\n \n \nGetting back to my reasoning, again, it centres on the principle that nothing additive comes into existence, 'ex nihilo, ab nihilo'. This is prima facie truth. It is your responsibility to show that this not the actual case wrt adaptive traits arising out of accidental, non-systematic changes within a complex, productive system. As pointed out ad infinitum, the sole and only way you have of doing that is by taking an actual, empirically observwed case, and proving a/that the novel trait is additive, i.e., that it increases productivity in the biosystem wrt survival, well-being, and possibly reproduction, and, b/that that trait was the determined, mechanical result of a genetic alteration that arose spontaneously, by accident, [insofar as the organism is concerned].\n\n No, he's showing that sposntaneous and accidental changes do in fact happen, and that your claim (which I think you intended to be \"ex nihilo, nihil fit\") does not apply here, at least not in the way that you are attempting to use it.\n \n \nWRT to 'the nylon bug', the eubacterium's novel ability to digest nylonase is definitely acceptable as a novel adaptive trait. It fulfills condition a/. But there is absoluteley no reason whatsoever to assume that it fulfills condition b/,as above. Eubacteria have a special mechanism for generating novel chemico/genetic combinations in their plasmid dna, using hypermutation etc., in order to solve molecular problems, by systematically generating new 'genes' that directly generate new proteins, and the new protein IS the new trait/enzyme. This in no way violates the 'ex nihilo', but certainly is no case of 'spontaneous generation' via 'accidental' genetic mutation. In fact, the fact that the poor bacterium had been semi-starving, for many generations, in pools of indigestible nylonase, indicates rationally that the ability to improve their circumstances by altering their plasmid dna, [as eubacteria all do, in several ways], so as to generate a protein/enzyme that would allow metabolic nourishment from the previously indigestible nylon waste, clearly points to systemic endogenous adaptive mutagenesis, where vitality-<intelligence-<volition + chemical components-<novel adaptive trait.\n There is absolutely no rational, reason to accept your proposition i.e., that the absence, lack, lacune, non-existence, of order [i,e., randomness] 'spontaneously' 'just happened' to create it.\n\n At this point, you have the burden of proof. There's no evident 'vitality force' nor any noncorporeal intelligence. Bacteria do not seem to have anything to think with, nor do they have anything with which to intercept vitality forces or intelligence fields. On the other hand, mutation, recombination, natural selection, and genetic drift are seen (but everyone but you) to exist and to influence both allelle frequencies and phenotypes.\n \n You are unable to show that the bacteria know anything about nylon, or that they have some way of saying, \"if I change my DNA thusly, I can make protein X, which will be able to decompose this molecule (which I have never seen before), and will thus be able to change it into molecules Y and Z, which I will be able to digest.\" Even if you could show all that, it remains clear that essentially all the individual bacteria cannot figure this out, because nearly all bacteria, given a diet of nothing but nylon, will simply die. So even if some bacteria do manage to blindly stummble into a solution, it is evident that the population overall is not doing any better than hit-and-miss, Edison-type, try-everything guesswork, which puts us right back into \"just got lucky\" as an explanation for what happened. All those bacteria are doing with hypermutation is pulling the lever faster on the slot machine - you have not shown that they are doing anything intelligently. They seem to be unconsciously and nonvolitionally relaxing their repair mechanisms. This response quite likely began simply as an occasionally beneficial side-result of the failing or shutting down of their bodies' least critical processes in extremis, and not as a decision to try a 'hail, Mary' solution, let alone as intelligent tinkering. \n \n [When Edison said stuff like \"99% perspiration, 1% inspiration\", he was describing his idiosyncratic work process rather than the way science is supposed to operate. Interestingly, his procedure much more closely resembled happenstance, bricolaged evolution, than intelligently designed scientific investigation.]",

   "**\n FYI wrt the 'gene determined' , 'genetic chemicals = organismic trait', darwinist POV expressed in this thread, see this link--\n \n \"What is Epigenetics?\n Conrad Waddington, originally defined the term epigenetics as 'the interactions of genes with their environment that bring the phenotype into being'. Today, the term is used to describe the study of heritable changes in genome function that occur without a change in DNA sequence. This includes; the study of how patterns of gene expression are passed from one cell to its descendants, how gene expression changes during the differentiation of one cell type into another, and how environmental factors can change the way genes are expressed. There are far-reaching implications of epigenetic research for agriculture and for human biology and disease, including our understanding of stem cells, cancer and ageing.\n \n \n Genomes Vs. EpigenomesIn the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, genomic DNA is highly folded and compacted with histone and non-histone proteins into a dynamic polymer called chromatin. Gene expression, chromosome segregation, DNA replication, repair, and recombination all act, not on DNA alone, but on this chromatin template. The discovery that enzymes can (re)organise chromatin into accessible and inaccessible configurations revealed epigenetic mechanisms that considerably extend the information potential of the genetic code. Thus, one genome can generate many 'epigenomes', as the fertilised egg progresses through development and translates its information into a multitude of cell fates.\n \n Since the early discoveries of Gregor Mendel, Walther Flemming, Theodore Boveri and others, Europe has been a world leader in unravelling the principles of heredity through genetic and chromosome research. Studies of chromosomes and heredity now have added significance, following the complete sequencing of many eukaryotic genomes, including that of humans. These 'genome projects' have shown that although humans may have a much bigger genome than less complex organisms, we do not have that many more protein coding genes. For example, the 140 million base pair (Mb) long genome of the fruit fly contains ~17,000 genes. The human genome is 21x larger (3000Mb), but still contains only ~ 40,000 genes. This suggests that \"We are more than just the sum of our genes\", and that biological complexity depends less on gene number, and more on how those genes are used (expressed), which is largely due to epigenetic mechanisms.\"\n \n at-- http://www.epigenome-noe.net/aboutus/epigenetics.php",

Prove your claim of random, chemical, physical alteration at the 'gene' level leading deterministically, mechanically, to productive, adaptive, traits in complex, productive organisms, or go bother someon else. I'm sick of having to repeat myself ad infinitum, as if I were talking to a brick wall.\n \n \n\n You've said over and over that 'what happens next' is the whole argument.\n\n \n **\n I've never claimed that anything \"happens next\" as a result of a randomly generated, _novel_[original] 'gene', [that is, molecular configuration]. Just the opposite. I've repeatedly said that meaninglessness will lead to nothing, unless it arises out of the destruction of the meaningful, in which case it will only lead to corruption and loss of productivity inthe complex system.\n \n \n\n Thus we come to the nylonase gene. Contradictory to your assumption that 'new gene = new word' the nylonase gene is perfectly legible to the organism for the very, very simple reason that all possible triplets and triplet sequences are legible to the protein synthesising apparatus.\n\n \n **\n If that were true, and your so-called, \"protein synthesizing apparatus\", [whatever that 'little machine thingy' may be], were it mechanically driven to translate your DNA/RNA molecules into protein molecules of a particular kind, would make all 'genes' generate their particular, specific proteins. But they do not. Only a few of them do.\n It would appear that 'legibility' is insufficient. What is discernible must also be meaningful, and your assumption that mere legibility automatically confers significance and meaning is preposterous. Lots of 'messages' are legible, without being readable. Every word you encounter for the first time is, until you establish its meaning, from context or a dictionary, a clear example of that very thing.\n \n However, as has been repeated to you a hundred times, the fact that the bacterium can 'read' a novel molecule in its plasmid DNA, [after generating it by hypermutation in response to chronic semi- starvation], and then directly produce a protein/enzyme that chemically solves the problem of breaking down nylonase into nutrients that can be metabolized by the cell, is no example of your \"random mutation\". Why you refuse to accept that 'systematic generation' is NOT 'spontaneous generation', I'll leave our readers to figure out for themselves. The 'nylon bug' is a classic example of evolution by endogenous adaptive mutagenesis, and is nothing at all like the supposed 'magick', the 'it just happens, that's all', of your 'random genetic mutation'.\n \n \n\n So again I ask you: do you accept that an RM-originated nylonase gene\n\n \n **\n And I'll tell again, and for the very last time, NO. Random accident has nothing to do with the generation of novel, productive traits in any complex, productive system, and 'the nylon bug' is a classic example of darwinists leaping to a false conclusion based on a superstitious assumption about how reality operates.\n \n \n\n would be translated by the bacterium into the nylonase enzyme? And if not, why not? Why would the organism not construct the enzyme, when every codon in the altered gene is perfectly legible?\n\n \n **\n The point is that the process of protein/ehnzyme generation is teleological and systematic. Not, as you assume from your metaphysic, coincidental and accidental. The fact that the cell is able to 'read' the very material it 'writes', is far from astounding.\n \n \n\n Your last post simply asserts \"that's not what happened\". The trouble is, you've already agreed that RM can and does originate genes - create them for the first time ever. So unless you can come up with a reason why the perfectly legible nylonase gene would not be translated, one amino acid at a time, into the nylonase enzyme... what grounds do you have for eliminating RM as a candidate for originating the nylon-digesting trait?\n\n \n **\n For the gazillioneth [and very last] time, the protein/enzyme was generated systematically, via adaptive hypermutation, in response to a chronic stimulus, using a special idiosyncrasy eubacteria have for that very purpose--plasmid dna. There is NO RANDOM, ACCIDENTAL, SPONTANEOUS MUTATION in this case. Get over it.\n \n \n\n It's not a question of what you personally think happened, it's a question of what you can logically prove didn't happen.\n\n \n **\n Since it is a principle of logic that negative propositions are impossible to 'prove', your demand is perfectly illogical. The onus of proof is always on the person making the positive assertion. Therefore it is up to you to prove that, as you claim, the 'nylon bug' became able to metabolize nylon waste thanks to a random, accidental, coincidental, reshuffling of its plasmid dna. Something that, 'just happened, that's all'. \n \n Good luck with that.",

   "Which is entirely applicable to the materialist/mechanist argument mounted by peeling, that bits of stuff, DNA molecules, nucleotide triplets, whatever you want to call them, lead, in mechanically determined fashion, from their spontaneously generated selves, in purely linear fashion, to a novel organismic trait.\n\n Nonsense. Taking the fact that there are often a lot of things going on for which we don't have complete descriptions and inflating that to an argument that there is something psychical at work is the work of quacks and con artists.\n \n \nIf elec thinks my arguments were \"gutted\", he should be able to show how, why, and where, [with quoted material], any rational or empirical material, presented by anyone here, including peeling, actually performed any such deed. He cannot. So he frets and struts his hour, and that's all it amounts to.\n\n I've mentioned the Lederberg experiment repeatedly. You took your feeble shots at it a while back, and they weren't any good then, either. How about you try again?\n \n \nGee folks, what did elec do with that key word, \"randomly\"? Now ya see it, now ya don't, in elec's little shell game.\n\n Great rhetoric, no substance. The omission of the word \"randomly\" was in no way, shape, or form an attempt to pull a fast one. I stand by the statement with the word in question firmly in place: up until this most recent explanation, it seemed to me that wabbit was saying that beneficial random mutations cannot happen, but they can in microbes because microbes are special. (wabbit posted this tangential stuff on epigenetics and then went off about how microbes are different; was I the only one to get this impression?) He insists that the laws of the universe prevent random mutations from being beneficial. He previously appealed to the lousy application of the laws of thermodynamics to information in order to justify his outlandish claims, but it is now clear that his justification is even more ludicrous. Is he appealing to some other law now? Is he misinterpreting yet another scientific paper? No, he's basing this claim on... his own, made-up \"law\" about psychical effects. When all else fails, make up a \"law\" that says you're right.\n \n \nTrying to make the assertion that a bacterium [using billions of cells in hypermutation], that systematically induces a genetic mutation [insertion, duplication, whatever] which immediately produces a different protein molecule which bestows a chemical/molecular trait, is the exact same evolutionary process that produced wings, lungs, eyes, etc., is so logically contorted as to be not only bizarre, but disingenuous and deceitful. You might even say, just plain stupid.\n\n Oh, I completely agree. Trying to make the assertion that bacteria, or any other life, actually psychically induce favorable genetic mutations -- even without drawing any parallels or analogies -- is bizarre, disingenuous, and perhaps just plain stupid. And wabbit does it in quite a deceitful way. So trying to present this idea as the actual cause of evolution really is inanity at its finest.\n \n \nOne of these \"two claims\" is not mine, but elec's. Say that I made a contradictory claim is just another one of his lies. And it is so transparent that it is a truly stupid lie, to boot.\n\n Actually, it was yours. pandion and I both roasted you on thermodynamics before you finally decided that you'd call it something besides thermodynamics. Of course, ridding yourself of the problems that the laws of thermodynamics stuck you with also ridded you of any link to actual laws of the universe, which is why you've resorted to making up your own.\n \n \nHe has focussed this 'gene-centric', 'random generation' argument on 'microbes' , i.e., eubacteria, for at least the past dozen pages. It seems to me that the first mention of microbes and hypermutation appeared on page 5 or 6. It is now page 21. Why does elec keep spouting such stupid lies?!?\n\n I went back page by page for several pages searching for a string that would tell me when anything microbe related came up. I didn't go back to page 5 or 6, but certainly there hasn't been much discussion of microbes after you posted the random article. So now I have. The first reference to anything \"microbial\" is a passing reference on page 14. \"Eubacteria\" comes up on page 19, apparently shortly after you learned about plasmids for the first time and began ranting about them. \n \n \nAs for L&L'51, I showed that peeling, elec, and all the other materialist/darwinists who believe that this 'plating-methodology' paper supported their superstition are wrong to do so. I didn't just claim that they are wrong; as with L&D'43, I showed just how, where, and why they are wrong. No point rehashing that matter; materialists just can't handle the truth it.\n\n Then it should be easy to give a brief synopsis of how, where, and why the Lederberg experiment doesn't show what I say it does. Surely your explanation isn't that \"revertant\" stuff a while back? That's so easy to knock out of the park, I'm surprised Peeling didn't jump on it harder than he did. Are you sticking with that reason, or would you rather concoct another?\n \n \n \n \n \nOnly where 'gene' is defined, _and you have so defined it_, as nothing more than a collection of molecules.\n\n So as soon as you realize that a genes are molecules that are physically manipulated in predictable ways -- completely absent of psychical forces -- in ways that result in other, useful molecules being produced, we'll all be done with this nonsense.\n \n \nNone of this agrees with your key position, i.e., that random, 'spontaneous generation', of a novel molecule means the spontaneous generation of novel, meaningful information. This distinction has been pointed out to you about 50 billion times, and I'm getting really sick of you ignoring it.\n\n We can generate random sequences of DNA or RNA and use them to produce proteins. There is no mystical \"information content\" variable that changes any of the process. We're getting really sick of you ignoring this.\n \n \nYou keep insisting that every 'genetic' molecule possible already 'codes' for a trait. That simply is not true. It isn't even remotely close to the truth, and I'm sure that you know that, so what do you think you're doing?\n\n Says the person who didn't even know what transcription and translation were. Every possible genetic molecule is capable of producing a corresponding protein, regardless of the origin of that genetic molecule or the process by which it arose.\n \n \nFor the gazillioneth [and very last] time, the protein/enzyme was generated systematically, via adaptive hypermutation...\n\n For the gazillionth time: NO, you have no idea what you're talking about. The protein was not generated via adaptive hypermutation, unless you mean indirectly, which I am nowhere near assuming you understand. Have you ever taken biology?",

Time you guys climbed out of your L&D'43 and L&L'51 fantasies, woke up, and smelled the coffee of the 21st century.\n \n \n\n Then all you have to do is explain why an RM-originated nylonase gene could not be translated into a series of amino acids to form the nylonase enzyme.

YOU have to prove your fanciful, but 'positive' claim, that the \"nylonase gene\" was accidentally and spontaneously generated, instead 9of systematically generated by the organism itself, in direct response to a chronic, vital stimulus--a nutritive-poor, 'extreme', exotic, and anomalous man-made environment. And while you're at it, you can explain how other 'extremophiles' 'got lucky'. \n \n \n Quote:\n For the gazillioneth [and very last] time, the protein/enzyme was generated systematically, via adaptive hypermutation, \n \n \n There's no evidence of a hypermutational response, only a relaxation of error-correction protocols,\n\n \n **\n Duh?!?

However, we've agreed that long before that ever happened RM would have originated the variant gene, yes? \n\n \n **\n I am so fed up with your disingenuous dishonesty. I don't think I shall talk to you again until you rediscover your integrity. I agreed that that RM could, and often does, result in many and various molecular combinations. You materialists call these things, 'genes'. So by your definition, yes, a 'gene', strictly as a particular molecular combination, could arise for no reason, by pure accident, ie., 'at random'. Which doesn't matter a damn, since simple molecules are not information, and it is the information _sometimes_ encoded in these molecules, not the molecules themselves, that matters. You claim that each of these chemical combos, these 'genes', in and of its own existence and nothing else, always carries a 'message' that must always be 'read' and 'acted upon' by an organism's 'message-reading machinery' in a certain way. That is simply untrue. We know thatin different organisms, the same \"gene\" can 'code for different traits, and that different \"genes\", in different organisms, can 'code for' the same trait. There is no deterministic 'lock' between 'gene' and 'message'/'trait'.\n \n \n\n So all I need to do is show that such a gene would be translated into the nylonase enzyme and I've proved that the trait - the ability to digest nylon - would have first existed long before nylon was invented.\n\n \n **\n In your dreams! You first have to show that a certain molecule/'gene' MUST determine a certain trait, and that you have completely failed to do. See above.\n \n \n\n I don't need to give a damn what happened in that puddle of factory waste, because those bacteria weren't originating the trait.\n\n \n **\n Oh, I forgot!! It was your 'spontaneous generation' fairy that originated the trait!! Duh!\n \n \n\n By agreeing that RM can originate the gene, you gave me a foot in the door.\n\n \n **\n You wish. Your problem is that you still assume, irrationally and falsly, that the medium [the chemical molecule, the 'gene'] is the message [the information]. But you have defined 'gene' in strictly chemical, molecular terms, divorced and distinct from any information content. So you won't be selling any Fuller brushes or encyclopedias around here.\n \n \n\n After that, your whole argument has been that a nylonase gene thus generated could not be parsed by the organism to create the nylonase enzyme.\n\n \n **\n Not true. I have argued that such a 'gene' would have no 'information' wrt nylonase, or more accurately, that such a 'gene' would be meaningless, unless and until, first, it mechanically and irresistably caused the cell to generate a particular protein/enzyme that broke down the nylonase molecule. But you have nowhere demonstrated that this ever originated because _it had to be the case_; you merely show that _it is now the case_. Once again, see above on the difference between the molecule/'gene' and the meassage/trait. \n \n You leap to the materialist assumption that whatever is now, always had to be what it is now. That's called, 'mechanical determinism'. And you assume that it applies to information in the same mechanical fashion that it applies to molecules and other 'bits of stuff'. Despite all empirical evidence to the contrary.\n Second, you claim that this 'gene' produced this enzyme 'by happy accident', without ever giving an example of this particular 'gene', and this particular protein/enzyme 'product appearing in any eubacterial genome that is not found in that particular kind of \"puddle of factory waste\". So whether or not such a 'gene' might be generated by accident, there is no reason to believe that the enzyme it now generates in the presense of nylonase would ever have been generated, if the organism hadn't needed it.\n In order to prove that this 'gene' must produce this enzyme in any cell in which it is found, you have to find a cell somewhere that possesses the 'gene' and the enzyme, without any past or present or lateral contact with this strain of bacteria, or with nylonase itself. \n \n This should be a very simple and easy task to perform if, as you claim, chemicals are perpetually generating that particular 'gene', spontaneously, and that once they randomly generate the 'gene', 'it' automatically generates the protein that breaks down nylonase, and that this 'just happens' over and over again, even in places and in times where no nylonase has ever existed. All you have to do is set up a bunch of batches of 'nylonase free' eubacteria, make sure that they are perfectly isolated from any 'nylon bugs' or nylonase, and check on them every few million generations to see if your 'gene' and its attendant protein have 'popped up' yet. Call us if they ever do.\n \n \n \n\n But when I ask you why it could not, you just backpedal and say the gene didn't arise via RM. That's not an answer, it's just a contradiction of the agreement you were so emphatic about earlier. We know the gene can arise via RM. So please, explain precisely why that sequence of nucleotides could not be translated by the organism into the nylonase enzyme.\n\n \n **\n That's not \"back-pedalling\". That's a stone fact. And it destroys your entire \"RM\", \"spontaneous generation\" argument. Certain molecules may come into existence by accident, but meaning, i.e., information, never does.\n \n IAC, I'm repeating the same points I've been making since it seems like forever, and you are disingenuously being deliberately obtuse and ignoring them, for the gazillioneth time. This is an irritating and boring waste of time. Unless and until you have something better to offer than your same 'ol same 'ol, I'm taking a break.\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

   "You claim that each of these chemical combos, these 'genes', in and of its own existence and nothing else, always carries a 'message' \n\n \n No, WW, I don't say any such thing. DNA - like any symbolic language - is meaningless without the understanding of the 'reader'. What I am saying is that we empirically know how the protein synthesis apparatus of these organisms parses the DNA-encoded 'symbols', and we know that hasn't changed since the invention of nylon. It's impossible that it could have changed, because every single other gene would also have to change in order for them to continue to decode into the 'right' proteins. Not only is that very unlikely, we can see for a fact that it hasn't happened.\n \n \nNot true. I have argued that such a 'gene' would have no 'information' wrt nylonase, or more accurately, that such a 'gene' would be meaningless, unless and until, first, it mechanically and irresistably caused the cell to generate a particular protein/enzyme that broke down the nylonase molecule. But you have nowhere demonstrated that this ever originated because _it had to be the case_; you merely show that _it is now the case_.\n\n \n Ok, fine. Here's the empirical evidence we have:\n \n 1. The unmutated (non-nylon eating) version of the bacterium employs an empirically verifiable symbolic system of nucleotide triplets for translating DNA into proteins. It's the same, word for word, as the symbolic system used by all manner of other organisms for thousands of years.\n \n 2. The mutated (nylon-eating) version of the bacterium employs exactly the same symbolic system of nucleotide triplets for translating DNA into proteins, including the new nylonase gene.\n \n Nothing about the way the organism synthesises proteins has changed in the process of obtaining the nylon-digesting trait. The same gene, were it to occur at random to that organism a thousand years ago, would therefore have been translated into exactly the same enzyme.\n \n If you have some evidence or logic to suggest otherwise, please, put it on the table. Otherwise, I'd ask you to acknowledge that you have no reason to believe RM-originated nylonase genes would not have been translated into the nylonase enzyme.\n \n \nYou leap to the materialist assumption that whatever is now, always had to be what it is now. \n\n \n Not always, WW, just ever since the organism's symbolic code for translating DNA into proteins has been as it is now. If the language hasn't changed, why would the meaning of a gene? And the protein-encoding language hasn't changed. \n \n Is it really so irrational to conclude that the same instructions, in the same language, would result in the construction of the same end product? Surely that's more reasonable than what you're doing, which is to insist that it's completely impossible for that to happen.\n \n \nSo whether or not such a 'gene' might be generated by accident, there is no reason to believe that the enzyme it now generates in the presense of nylonase would ever have been generated, if the organism hadn't needed it.\n\n \n There are two reasons:\n \n 1. The protein synthesis language is unchanged, so the same gene a thousand years ago, in that organism's ancestors, would still describe the same enzyme.\n \n 2. We see the results of harmful mutations all the time: organisms helplessly producing malformed proteins that are of little or no use to them. Prior to the invention of nylon, nylonase would have been just such a protein. Again, what reason do you have to believe something different would happen in this particular case?\n \n \nCertain molecules may come into existence by accident, but meaning, i.e., information, never does.\n\n \n Except that you've no grounds for saying the organism would find the mutant gene meaningless, since it employs the same language in the synthesis of proteins as it and other organisms have done for thousands of years. The language hasn't changed!\n \n \nIAC, I'm repeating the same points I've been making since it seems like forever, and you are disingenuously being deliberately obtuse and ignoring them, for the gazillioneth time. This is an irritating and boring waste of time. Unless and until you have something better to offer than your same 'ol same 'ol, I'm taking a break.\n\n \n Well, perhaps the information I've given you here, that the protein synthesis language used by the organism has not changed since nylon was invented, will provide food for thought.",

He doesn't actually dispute that the experiments show mutations occurring prior to, or in the absence of, the environmental stimulus to which they are adaptive. Instead, he disputes the standard interpretation of those results, invoking his belief that RM cannot improve a complex system to support an alternative interpretation: that traits like antibacterial resistance are deliberately and systematically returned to the gene pool of a growing colony.\n \n I have pointed out in the past that the statistical pattern of re-emergence of these traits is indistinguishable from what we would expect from random mutation. In response he has said that this is irrelevant because mutated genes do not produce traits. Instead, he asserts that the trait comes first as an organismic response, and is then encoded as a gene. He has gone on to say that the same gene, occurring at random prior to the 'encoding' event, would do nothing because the organism wouldn't know what it meant; it would be a new 'word' to which no meaning has yet been assigned.

WW's contention is that the bacterial 'trait' of being able to digest nylon could not have arisen via RM. Since he acknowledges that the gene itself could have arisen via RM, his last line of defence is to claim that a gene originating via RM could not have been translated into the nylonase enzyme, for the reason he stated above: an RM-nylonase gene would have been a meaningless 'word' the organism could not have understood.\n \n However, the symbolism used to 'decode' the nylonase gene is the same as is employed in every other protein-encoding gene in the bacterium, and that 'language' - 64 possible triplets interpreted as instructions to assemble the various amino acids, plus start/stop punctuation - has not changed in those bacteria since the invention of nylon (and probably not in the last few hundred million years, for that matter).\n \n Right now, I'm saying that it's at least possible for the exact same sequence of DNA, interpreted according to what we know would have been the exact same triplet-<amino acid language, would have resulted in the same synthesised protein, even if it happened a thousand years prior to the invention of nylon. It wouldn't have done the bacterium any good, but it would have been a bona fide trait indistinguishable from that possessed by certain bacteria today.\n \n WW on the other hand says this is flatly impossible, that the nylonase gene could not have been translated into a protein at any time before the bacterium encountered nylon waste products.

   "**\n \n For the sake of any lurkers who might give a twist, I offer corrections to peeling's \"spin\" on my position wrt the evolution [origin] of novel adaptive organismic traits. It is important to point out from the start that I make a qualitative distinction between the ORIGINS of adaptive organismic traits, and the ensuing INHERITANCE of adaptive organismic traits. Darwinist/geneticist/materialists make no such distinction, and do everything in their power to blur and erase and corrupt thatr distinction wherever and whenever it is brought out into open debate.\n \n A case in point. Peeling makes this statement about my position--\n \n \nEarlier he mentioned the seminal '41 and '43 experiments designed to establish if mutation happened in response to environmental stimuli or not. He doesn't actually dispute that the experiments show mutations occurring prior to, or in the absence of, the environmental stimulus to which they are adaptive.\n\n \n What he should have said, truth be told, is this--\"He [ww]doesn't actually dispute that the experiments show mutations occurring prior to, or in the absence of, the environmental stimulus to which they are [ALREADY, INHERENTLY] adaptive.\" Once an organism, a biosystem, such as the e.coli bacterium, has originated an adaptive response to a chronic and vital environmental stimulus, , and incorporated it into its inherited 'bag of tricks', there is no need for it to 're-invent the wheel' every time the need for it re-occurs among its descendents.\n \n WRT the e.coli. resistance to the antibacterial agents [phages] used against it in the L&D'43 and L&L'51 experiments, the fact that the e.coli of that time, and every time for the past many millions of years, inherits a natural, epigenetic cellular mechanism which is generated by the development of the the eusocial colony of cells once that colony achieves a certain size, [i.e., a certain rough number of cells]. The generation of thios mechanism is systematic, and is related to the phenomenon of 'quorum sensing'.\n \n This assertion is easily tested via the scientific method. Simply keep exposing small batches of natural e.coli. to the phage, reserving a few cells from each batch from that exposure, and when a batch is completly wiped out by the phage, make the reaonable assumption that the cell reserved from that batch has no more natural resistance to the phage than its fellow clones had. Then take that cell or cells and allow them to start new 'cultures', and then repeat the process with them. When satisfied that you now have e.coli cells with no inherited resitance to their old and ancient enemy, start new cultures and allow them to develop fully. Then test them for phage resistant cells. You will find that every single 'culture', once it has developed fully into a eusocial colony, i.e., surpassed the requisite population of cells, always\n possesses a certain number of phage resistant cells. This is a systematic phenomenon, a developmental phenomenon, an epigenetic phenomenon, a functional phenomenon, a regular phenomenon, a predictable phenomenon, that darwinist/geneticist/materialists want the world to believe is merely a random, accidental, anomalous genetic phenomenon. There may have been some feeble excuse for this in the 40's and 50's, when our understanding of eubacteria was pathetically thin, but to make that same insistence today borders on outright fraud.\n \n And that is why the missing word, \"ALREADY\", is so key to the distortion of my position presented by peeling, above. Contrary to his own position, mine is that eubacteria do not have to 'reinvent the wheel' each time they develop into a colony, because they epigenetically inherit a system that deals with such molecular problems as phages, with which they have carried on unceasing warfare for millionms, perhaps billions of years. They _systematically_ do what most other organisms, particularly multi-organ systems, simply cannot do. They systematically produce certain codons in their separate 'plasmid dna' system, because aeons have taught them to reserve a few 'resistance bestowing' cells against possible phage attack, or indeed, any molecular attack, by any toxic molecule, be it natural or artificial. \n They do not reserve such an inheritance in their chromosomal dna, because resistance comes at a cost, in terms of energy/productivity. It is necessary that, most of the time, only a few individual cells in all the colony possess that resistance, since for every clone to possess it is maladaptive for the colony as a whole. Of course, darwinist/geneticists refuse to accept the altruistic sacrifice of parts for the sake of wholes in complex productive systems. Which is why cellular apoptosis, a fundamental p[art of developmental biology, flies directly in the face of their 'survival of the fittest' mentality, and also why they refuse to accept the fact that, wrt eubacteria, the colony is the whole, the organism, and each eubacteria cell is not its own organism, but simply one more part of the whole. \n \n The point is, that once this systematic molecular response to molecular attack [and/or molecular opportunity] was ORIGINATED, i.e., EVOLVED, many aeons ago, it does not have to be re-invented, genetically, by a 'random mutation', every time another colony encounters a phage for its own 'first time'. Even though that is exactly what peeling, et al, want you to believe.\n \n [Note also that 'traits' internal to cells are 'molecular'/chemical, and that such molecular traits are qualitatively different from 'organic'/multicellular, extra-cellular traits, such as eyes, wings, flowers, etc. Darwinist/geneticists continually try to blur this distinction, which is why when they try to 'prove' their RMNS 'theory', they always 'go molecular', resort to the special idiosyncrasy of eubacteria, or the anomaly of sickle cell, and then tell the world that their molecular example proves their universal mechanism, that \"RM\" is what accounts for the _origin/evolution_ of all 'traits', be they chemical or morphological or behavioural, adaptive or maladaptive. This is obviously a false claim, and the wonder is that the world has allowed them to get away with it for such a long time. But, finally, developmental biology is starting to show up their mechanical geneticism for what it is--a con game that distorts biology to the service of a materialist/atheist agendum.\n \n \n\n Instead, he disputes the standard interpretation of those results, invoking his belief that RM cannot improve a complex system to support an alternative interpretation: that traits like antibacterial resistance are deliberately and systematically returned to the gene pool of a growing colony.\n\n \n **\n Change the word \"standard\" to 'darwinist', or 'geneticist', or 'materialist', and insert 'plasmid' in front of \"gene pool\", and I'll accept it.",

They are simply saying, \"What we we see is what we expect to see, because once we've seen it, then that's what we expect. Whatever it is. And whatever it is, it happens at random. So whatever we see is whatever we have seen before, and labelled 'random'.\" It's all horsepucky. There are lies, damned lies, and then there are statistics. I think Mark Twain said that first.\n \n \n\n In response he has said that this is irrelevant because mutated genes do not produce traits.\n\n \n **\n First, that is not the reason that I would give for dismissing statistical claims for random causation of adaptive genetic mutations. If you want to know why I dismiss assumptions derived from claims of 'statistical patterns' showing 'random causation of adaptive traits', I've just finished outlining them, above. Statistics are like the bible--you can interpret them anyway you choose, and, to re-phrase an old saying, even satan quotes them to his purposes. \n Second, I actually said that RANDOMLY mutated genes do not produce ADAPTIVE traits. As you can see, this very different from what peeling says I say. I belive that sometimes randomly generated mutations do produce traits. Unfortunately, such traits are always either so trivial as to be inconsequential, or, if they make a difference that actually makes a difference, they are negative, destructive, and maladaptive. They are always subtractive, never additive, as far as the productivity of the organism is concerned. And that goes for sickle cell anemia. The notion that such a destructive genetic malfunction could be termed beneficial to human beings is the kind of voodoo logic that only darwinists, desperate for even meretricious, specious support for their 'random accident is the source of adaptive novelty' notion, would ever stoop to using. In away, it's almost racist.\n \n \n\n Instead, he asserts that the trait comes first as an organismic response, and is then encoded as a gene.\n\n \n **\n I only asserted that opinion while the definition of 'gene' was still undecided. Once peeling opted for the standard chemical definition of a 'gene' as being any aggregation of three nucleotides, coded or uncoded, codon or 'other', then I had to change that statement to say that \"the trait comes first as an organismic response, and is then encoded as a [codon].\"\n codon, n.--A sequence of three adjacent nucleotides constituting the genetic code that determines the insertion of a specific amino acid in a polypeptide chain during protein synthesis or the signal to stop protein synthesis. answers.com\n Not all genes are codons.\n \n Genes, as defined chemically, can be randomly altered. Unless they form codons, or serve some other developmental function, it simply does not matter. Codons, OTH, cannot be altered randomly and remain, or become, adaptive.\n No meaningful, [meaning 'functional', 'productive'], gene, be it a codon or play some other developmental role, can be _randomly_ altered and remain functional, or become more productive in terms of function within the organismic biosystem. The rules of complex productive systems preclude that possibility, and so does the 'ex nihilo'.\n \n \n\n He has gone on to say that the same gene, occurring at random prior to the 'encoding' event, would do nothing because the organism wouldn't know what it meant; it would be a new 'word' to which no meaning has yet been assigned.

If a novel codon is not novel information, an original message, then the codon simply isn't original, by definition. By peeling's definition of 'gene' [as a simple chemical combo of three nucleotides, a 'triplet' which may not be a codon or even have no functional purpose whatsoever, as appears to be quite common], then a 'novel 'gene' is not only not analogous to an English word--it's not analogous to anything at all.

Despite all the arguing over symbols and genes and \"bits of chemicals,\" wabbit still has absolutely, positively no idea what a gene is. Shall I prove it?\n \n \n....

I have argued that such a 'gene' would have no 'information' wrt nylonase, or more accurately, that such a 'gene' would be meaningless, unless and until, first, it mechanically and irresistably caused the cell to generate a particular protein/enzyme that broke down the nylonase molecule.

WW's contention is that the bacterial 'trait' of being able to digest nylon could not have arisen via RM. Since he acknowledges that the gene itself could have arisen via RM, \n\n \n **\n Caveat--Never forgetting that this only applies when using peeling's definition of 'gene' as given for this thread after repeated demands that he define the word in his terms. His definition differs from other people's, simply because the word 'gene' is an amazingly slippery and equivocal one. Other geneticist/darwinists define 'gene' quite differently from peeling, and often from each other, but for purposes of this thread we settled upon his strictly molecular definition of a gene as any triplet of nucleotides. That is, as a physical entity, and not as a semiotic medium. I agreed that 'genes' are, as he defines them, [i.e., as a meaningless chemical entities], subject to random physical change. To distinguish between meaningless chemicals as 'genes', and semiotic, encoded, information-bearing chemicals as media, I have distinguished 'genes' from 'codons'. With this 'information-based', 'function-based distinction in place, 'genes' can be randomly changed, where they are meaningless, because any change in that which is meaningless is itself meaningless unless and until something else attaches some novel meaning to the change.\n \n It should be noted that whenever I speak of 'meaning' wrt organisms, I speak in terms of 'function', and 'function' in terms of 'productivity', and 'productivity' in terms of 'energy consumed relative to goals accomplished', and 'goals', generally, as enhanced survival, well-being, and, usually, self-replication. Therefore, when speaking of novel 'meaning', a new 'message' being encoded in a 'gene', thus turning it from a meaningless 'triplet/dna molecule' into a meaningful 'codon', I speak in terms of novel function and increased productivity.\n \n It is the darwinist/geneticist contention that new 'codons' occur automatically with every novel physical alteration of any dna 'triplet', meaning that 'the medium [dna] _is_ the message [trait information]'. If this were true, all dna would code for 'traits', but that is not the case. More importantly, the same dna can code for different traits, and different dna can code for the same trait. In biology, the medium most definitely is NOT the message. Unfortunately for darwinist/materialists, their worldview only recognises physical media, and denies the reality of psychical information. Their metaphysic asserts that existence is meaningless, absurd, and pointless, and so all we can do is simply observe and measure 'stuff in motion'.\n Which puts them at a terrible disadvantage when it comes to biological information systems, such as the various organismic 'codes', all of which are intrinsically teleological and purposive.\n \n And so, coming back to nylonase, and the famous 'nylon-eating bug', we should clarify a few things, with the help of wikipedia, below--\n \n \"Nylon-eating bacteria \n In 1975 a team of Japanese scientists discovered a strain of Flavobacterium living in ponds containing waste water from a factory producing nylon that was capable of digesting certain byproducts of nylon-6 manufacture, such as, 6-aminohexanoate linear dimer, even though those byproducts had not existed prior to the invention of nylon in 1935. Further study revealed that the three enzymes the bacteria were using to digest the byproducts were novel, significantly different than any other enzymes produced by other Flavobacterium strains (or any other bacteria for that matter), and not effective on any other material other than the man made nylon byproducts.[bold mine-ww] [1] This strain of Flavobacterium, Sp. K172, became popularly known as nylon eating bacteria, and the enzymes were collectively known as nylonase.\"\n \n Let us pause here to 'digest' all this. Not being a geneticist, my poor, ignorant layman's understanding is that each codon can only 'code for' one protein/enzyme, therefore it took not one, not two, but three [3]separate 'random mutations' to create 'nylonase', a chemical that breaks down nylon and and does nothing else. Gee, what do you think of those odds?\n Never mind. In the wonderful, magical world of geneticist 'spontaneous generation', anything and everything is possible, doncha know?!?!\n \n To continue with wiki--\n \n \"Further research\n Scientists were able to induce another species of bacteria, Pseudomonas, to evolve the capability to break down the same nylon byproducts in a laboratory by forcing them to live in an environment with no other source of nutrients.[/quote]\n \n **\n Golly, you mean they resorted to Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis, instead of just waiting around for more 'spontaneously generated', 'random wrt 'fitness'', 'coincidental wrt environment', 'accidental' codon creations?

[To say nothing of the complexity of 'frameshift mutations', per se.] Ain't spontaneous generation wunnerful?\n \n Wiki--\n \"Further analysis has led to speculation that the fact that the frame shift was able to produce a functioning enzyme was related to the absence of stop codons in the duplicate gene.[5] Research has continued in the hope of better understanding the mechanisms involved in the evolution of new enzymes, and because of the possible value of bacteria that can metabolize man made molecules to toxic waste cleanup.\n \n \n Role in creation-evolution controversy\n Nylon eating bacteria have been widely discussed in the context of the creation-evolution controversy. Organizations critical of creationism and intelligent design, such as the National Center for Science Education, and New Mexicans for Science and Reason (NMSR) have made extensive references to this research in postings on their websites, arguing that this research refutes claims made by creationists and intelligent design proponents, specifically, the statement that random mutation and natural selection can never add new information to a genome, and the statement that the odds against a useful new protein such as an enzyme arising through a process of random mutation would be prohibitively high.[6] [7]Creationists have disputed these conclusions, often citing analysis posted on the Answers in Genesis website that says that this phenomenon was evidence that plasmids in bacteria were a designed feature intended to allow bacteria to adapt easily to new food sources or cope with toxic chemicals.[8] NMSR, among others, has responded by saying that gene duplication and frame shift mutations were powerful sources of random mutation.[9] In particular, proof that it was these mutations that gave rise to nylonase, rather than the process based on plasmids suggested by AiG, has been obtained from DNA sequencing.[10][/quote]\n \n **\n IOW, \"New Mexicans for Science and Reason\", whoever they are, have simply voiced their opinion as if it were a matter of fact, which it is not.\n \n It has been my understanding that the ability to digest nylon waste arose under hypermutaion in the plasmid dna of eubacteria. This last swtatement seems to imply that it actually took place, with all its complexity, specificity, and variance [see above], in the chromosomal dna. To my mind, if this is true, then it makes the 'spontaneous generation' explanation even more incredible, fanciful, and bizarre.\n \n BTW, I never read AIG, and had no idea that they are voicing opinions similar to those that I have arrived at strictly from my own reasoning.\n \n Back to peeling--\n \n \"his last line of defence is to claim that a gene originating via RM could not have been translated into the nylonase enzyme, for the reason he stated above: an RM-nylonase gene would have been a meaningless 'word' the organism could not have understood.[/quote]\n \n **\n My \"last line of defence\"?!? Haw! That's cute. If anyone wants to believe with peeling that 'nylonase' means anything without the presence of nylon waste, he/she is free to do so. If s/he wants to believe that 'nylonase' and other nylon digesting enzymes arose spontaneously and coincidentally wrt the presence of nylon waste, [i.e., by random mutation] along with their faith in Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny, The Tooth Fairy, and \"Natural Selection\", well, I can't stop them.\n \n \n\n However, the symbolism used to 'decode' the nylonase gene is the same as is employed in every other protein-encoding gene in the bacterium, and that 'language' - 64 possible triplets interpreted as instructions to assemble the various amino acids, plus start/stop punctuation - has not changed in those bacteria since the invention of nylon (and probably not in the last few hundred million years, for that matter).\n\n \n **\n Which is a red-herring, and, since I never claimed that the system of encoding had to change with every new message encoded, a strawman argument to boot. The issue here is strictly how the system of encoding operates, particularly wrt novel information. Why peeling is trying to assert that it is about anything else is beyond me, but it probably has something to do with smoke and mirrors.\n \n \n\n Right now, I'm saying that it's at least possible for the exact same sequence of DNA, interpreted according to what we know would have been the exact same triplet-<amino acid language, would have resulted in the same synthesised protein, even if it happened a thousand years prior to the invention of nylon. It wouldn't have done the bacterium any good, but it would have been a bona fide trait indistinguishable from that possessed by certain bacteria today.\n\n \n **\n Nonsense. The 'trait' is the ability to metabolize nylon waste. That is its be-all and end-all, its alpha and omega. As wiki [above] points out, there is more than one chemical way of skinning that particular cat, so the chemicals involved are not essential to the trait itself. However, logic says that if the 'trait' is the ability to digest nylon, and there is no nylon present, then there is, ipso facto, no 'trait', either. No matter how many strange, meaningless, functionless chemicals bubble up out of nothing and nowhere.\n \n \n\n WW on the other hand says this is flatly impossible, that the nylonase gene could not have been translated into a protein at any time before the bacterium encountered nylon waste products.\n\n \n **\n Never said any such thing. I'm not concerned with molecules; only with traits, and the codes for them. It would seem to me that the tripartite mutation necessary to 'nylonase' [see wiki, above], beggers belief in the powers of 'random mutation',-- but that is not the point. The point is, as the fact that other mutations can produce the same nylon-metabolizing ability with different enzymes, [wiki, above],establishes, proteins/enzymes are not the 'trait', either. So, ignoring the odds and pretending that the triple simultaneous mutations necessary to 'nylonase' are not mathematically impossible, and so that assemblage of enzymes could have occurred in the past, [or anywhere and at any time where there was no nylon or any need to digest it], there would still not have been any such 'trait'. And that is all that matters.",

   "... therefore it took not one, not two, but three [3]separate 'random mutations' to create 'nylonase', a chemical that breaks down nylon and and does nothing else.\n\n To my knowledge, you are just plain wrong. The frameshift mutation discussed below created the enzyme that makes the major chemical changes. In other words, the \"trait\" of digesting nylon arose after one gene duplication followed (not necessarily immediately) by a frameshift addition. There is no requirement of three mutations for this to arise; there is no requirement of any simultaneous mutations for this to arise. In fact, there is no requirement for the three enzymes to arise simultaneously via simultaneous mutation. Haven't I already told you at least twice to have your emissions checked?\n \n \nSay what?!? Same organismic trait, namely, the ability to digest nylon waste, but using some other novel chemical/protein/enzyme/s than 'nylonase'?!? Meaning different 'codon/s' for the same trait?!?\n\n At the grocery store, if you ask for plastic, and I ask for paper, we both have a way to accomplish our purpose: get our groceries home. Does that mean that plastic and paper are composed of the same thing? No; it's as if you believe that only one possible sequence of amino acids can perform a given function, yet later you state that you know that this is not the case. Deliberate deception, or honest mistake, wabbit? Perhaps the discrepancy lies in your use of the word \"trait\"? Ah, yes,However, logic says that if the 'trait' is the ability to digest nylon, and there is no nylon present, then there is, ipso facto, no 'trait', either. No matter how many strange, meaningless, functionless chemicals bubble up out of nothing and nowhere.\nSo, had the enzyme existed in the bacterium despite the lack of nylon, it lacked the \"trait.\" Then, upon introduction of nylon waste, it gained the \"trait\" with no change in DNA or code or protein? I can't say I've been completely understanding all this nonsense about codes and symbols (again, you should simply focus on the damn chemicals already), but this seems contrary to what you've been pushing.\n \n \nTwo, [2], 'random' mutations in one!! [To say nothing of the complexity of 'frameshift mutations', per se.] Ain't spontaneous generation wunnerful?\n\n Not in one, but one, then later another. From the Ohno paper: \"A simple base change might silence the original coding potential, while giving a chain initiator to that alternative open reading frame, thereby, in a single step, producing a new enzyme sensu stricto with a hitherto nonexistent substrate specificity.\" [bold added]\n \n \n[To say nothing of the complexity of 'frameshift mutations', per se.]\n\n Complexity? Are you daft? Any addition or deletion of a number of bases that isn't divisible by three results in a frameshift mutation. This is obvious to anybody who can count to three. What's next, that duplications and point mutations are each highly improbable?\n \n \nBTW, I never read AIG, and had no idea that they are voicing opinions similar to those that I have arrived at strictly from my own reasoning.\n\n A realization that should trigger your gag reflex and make your skin crawl. We'll give you some time in case you feel the need to stay in the shower for two days straight, curled up in the corner and sucking your thumb.",

   "My \"last line of defence\"?!? Haw! That's cute. If anyone wants to believe with peeling that 'nylonase' means anything without the presence of nylon waste, he/she is free to do so.\n\n And if anyone wants to side with WW, and believe that a fish flopping around on a riverbank doesn't have the ability to breathe water, they are similarly at liberty to do so.\n \nWhich is a red-herring, and, since I never claimed that the system of encoding had to change with every new message encoded, \n\n Yes you did, by saying that new genes equated to new words. A new word entering the language is a change to the encoding system - an addition.\n \nNonsense. The 'trait' is the ability to metabolize nylon waste. That is its be-all and end-all, its alpha and omega.\n\n Precisely - the ability. Not whether it is currently doing it or not, or whether there is nylon waste within 100 yards, or whether nylon waste has ever been produced yet. A bacterium that produces nylonase has the ability to digest nylon waste. It possesses the trait.\n \nHowever, logic says that if the 'trait' is the ability to digest nylon, and there is no nylon present, then there is, ipso facto, no 'trait', either. \n\n See above for why this 'logic' is obviously incorrect.\n \nWW on the other hand says this is flatly impossible, that the nylonase gene could not have been translated into a protein at any time before the bacterium encountered nylon waste products.\n\n \nNever said any such thing.\n\n Sorry, WW, but yes you did:\n \nI have argued that such a 'gene' would have no 'information' wrt nylonase, or more accurately, that such a 'gene' would be meaningless,\n\n \nI've never claimed that anything \"happens next\" as a result of a randomly generated, _novel_[original] 'gene', [that is, molecular configuration]. Just the opposite. I've repeatedly said that meaninglessness will lead to nothing\n\n \nNot only is there a the insurmountable 'ex nihilo' rational argument against your superstitious appeal to the magick of spontaneous generation and lucky coincidence,\n\n And most clearly of all, you said it here:\n \nSo how about it: will the RM origination of a novel variant gene - which to the organism reading it will inevitably appear to be a readable, understandable 'sentence' of recognisable symbols - be decoded into a novel protein, such as the nylonase enzyme? \n\n \nFirst, no, it will not. Second, I've told you repeatedly why it will not.\n\n \n Shall I continue? Over and over again you have said that an RM gene would be meaningless, that the organism would be incapable of reading it because it would be a 'word' to which no meaning had been attached.\n \n But, since you seem to be denying ever having said that, presumably you now accept that an RM-originated nylonase gene would be translated by the organism into nylonase, yes? So now your defence is that such an event wouldn't really count as a trait - that for an organism to be said to have an 'ability' it must be, right at this very moment, exercising that ability - otherwise it doesn't have it.\n \n I'm going to take a break now and temporarily obtain the ability to metabolise caffeine.",
