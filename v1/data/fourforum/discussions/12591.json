   "Thank you for being here and for all your thoughts and prayers...\n \n My name is Myah. I'm 23 years old and a single mom to a very special little girl. \n \n When I was 19 weeks pregnant, I was told that my baby had no brain. This condition is known as \"anencephaly.\" I was told that my baby was only alive because she was attached to me, but that she couldn't survive on her own. The doctor said that I could continue the pregnancy safely, but that my baby would die shortly after being born. Or I could choose to terminate the pregnancy then, which would mean being induced at 20 weeks and letting my baby die without ever seeing or holding her (I don't even want to know what they do with babies in this case). Well, to some people this would be a difficult decision, but it wasn't for me. I knew there was nothing to gain by terminating the pregnancy and I already loved my daughter more than anyone else in the world. Even if she was unconscious like the doctors said and lived for only a few seconds or minutes --even if she was stillborn --it was worth it to me. And so we began our journey...\n\n The story of Faith Hope\n \n \nAnencephaly is a cephalic disorder that results from a neural tube defect that occurs when the cephalic (head) end of the neural tube fails to close, usually between the 23rd and 26th day of pregnancy, resulting in the absence of a major portion of the brain, skull, and scalp[1]. Children with this disorder are born without a forebrain, the largest part of the brain consisting mainly of the cerebral hemispheres (which include the isocortex, which is responsible for higher level cognition, i.e., thinking). The remaining brain tissue is often exposed-not covered by bone or skin.[2]\n ....\n The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) describes the presentation of this condition as follows:\n \n A baby born with anencephaly is usually blind, deaf, unconscious, and unable to feel pain. Although some individuals with anencephaly may be born with a main brain stem, the lack of a functioning cerebrum permanently rules out the possibility of ever gaining consciousness. Reflex actions such as breathing and responses to sound or touch may occur. [2]\n\n Anencephaly - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n This is a horrible disease.\n But at the same time, the mother has a kid that can never \"gain consciousness\".\n I guess it's a mother's choice, but the \"anti-abortion\" side would declare that this baby must be allowed to be born. The kind of impact that would have on a mother?\n emoticon_frazzled\n \n If a person is in a coma they can never wake up from, people can understand \"pulling the plug\".\n But here, this little person was never \"awake\" in the first place...",

   "My first thought upon reading this was that it's a load of ####; a fetus without a brain wouldn't die \"shortly after being born\", they would never have any life to begin with, their heart simply would not beat.\n \n Looking up the details of the condition, it seems the baby has a brain, it is missing *part* of that brain.\n \n \nChildren with this disorder are born without a forebrain, the largest part of the brain consisting mainly of the cerebral hemispheres (which include the isocortex, which is responsible for higher level cognition, i.e., thinking). \n\n \n I agree it is the mothers' choice.\n \n Having a Psychology degree, there is more complexity in this situation than there wold be at first glance.\n \n I would not be surprised if 1,000,000 mothers had children with this condition, that some of them lived with impaired or unusual cognitive functions.\n \n Eg Einstein was missing part of his brain (other parts of it grew to take its place), if we simply aborted because of a misconception that missing part of your brain = death, we would miss one of the greatest minds of history. The chances of survival are probably slim, but a hysterical mothers' reinterpretations of what a doctor told her are probably not the best basis for understanding such a condition.\n \n According to the wiki, such a baby would \"usually\" be born in a coma-like state, I'm sure given sufficient funds they could be kept alive (though to what end?).\n \n Sorry to drag off topic from abortion, but I just don't like the facts being distorted.\n \n \n Based on what I can see about the condition, I also doubt that it is a \"disease\" in any meaningful sense (except in the broad sense that if I break my arm, I have the \"disease\" of broken armitis)",
