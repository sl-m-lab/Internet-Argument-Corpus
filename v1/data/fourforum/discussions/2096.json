   "I am a German living in Germany, and people around me always tell me that I have to stay in an English speaking country, if I really to learn the English language properly. I vehemently disagree with them. I can watch BBCworld and CNN, and I can use the internet as much as I want to, because I have got a flatrate. I just love browsing the net for sites on Chemestry, Biology, History and just about anything. Talking on the phone with somebody in England costs me less than 4 Euros(less than 4$) per h, which is far more inexpensive than going to England or the USA for a long period of time, not to mention what private tutors charge. I am sitting here in front of my computer, my desk is full of text extracted out of the net, I can use hundreds of dictionaries and translation programs without paying a cent (neither Euro Cent nor US Cent:) \n I am also leraning the French and the Dutch language that way. I was in Canada for 4 weeks, and that was the only possibility to practise my language in an English speaking country. Is that English really that poor so that this text here prove them right?",

My sister learned how to speak french and Arabic here in the states and she hasn't really gone anywhere out of the country except for a trip to Canada. I want to learn latin sometime but there isn't really a place to do that except for Rome and Vatican City.\n \n Your English looks fine with me. emoticon_xhoho",

I am learning German in school, and while i am by no means good or serious at it, i know some options to learn more is to read German literature, which is readily available online, browse the Web in German, talk with Germans or German-speakers, even camps and CDs and lessons and many things that would be cheaper and more efficient than actually going to Germany or Austria or somewhere. \n \n While i think that actually visiting a foreign country is valuable as to acually see/experience culture and hear the language more and perhaps explore regional dialects, it is by no means necessary to learn a language :)",

   "though living in the US for a year now, has made me better able to understand smaller nuances, subtleties and humour.\n\n \n I think this pretty much sums the issue up right here. Sure you dont need to live in the country to learn the language, but to really know the language, to understand the subtelties of grammar, pronunciation, humour, slang and evolution of the language, you need to live there. For example, my family has hosted several Japanese exchange students, whose english was impeccable. However, here in Australia, we sometimes say 'rightio' instead of 'ok'. To whit:\n \n 'Could you make me a coffee?'\n 'Rightio'\n \n This word completely threw most of these students, who had no idea what we meant by it. Other examples, such as the use of sarcasm and the like, were abundant. You can learn the language at home, but to really know it, you have to live there.",

   "I agree with Adept. Living in the country where the language you are studying is much more helpful than just learning out of a book. I myself am departing for Beijing to go to school for a year in 14 days, and generally people say that my Chinese is good, but I still don't have the intricacies of humor, grammar, and what have you. And European1979, your English is very good, but tell me, would you be able to detect sarcasm, etc. if you were talking if you had only learned from a book, internet, etc, but not learned from living in that country, immersed in the language?",
