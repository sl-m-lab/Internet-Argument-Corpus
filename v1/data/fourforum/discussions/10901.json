   "Just for the record, Williams has issued a \"clarification\" of his remarks:\n \n What did the Archbishop actually say? \n \n \nThe Archbishop made no proposals for sharia in either the lecture or the interview, and certainly did not call for its introduction as some kind of parallel jurisdiction to the civil law.\n \n Instead, in the interview, rather than proposing a parallel system of law, he observed that \"as a matter of fact certain provisions of sharia are already recognised in our society and under our law\" . When the question was put to him that: \"the application of sharia in certain circumstances - if we want to achieve this cohesion and take seriously peoples' religion - seems unavoidable?\", he indicated his assent. \n \n [...]\n \n He explained that his core aim was to: \"to tease out some of the broader issues around the rights of religious groups within a secular state\" and was using sharia as an example. These include:\n [*]How when the law does not take seriously religious motivation, it fails to engage with the community in question and opens up real issues of power by the majority over the minority, with potentially harmful effects for community cohesion.[*]How the distinction between cultural practices and those arising from genuine religious belief might be managed.[*]How to deal with the possibility that a 'supplementary jurisdiction \"could have the effect of reinforcing in minority communities some of the most repressive or retrograde elements in them, with particularly serious consequences for the role and liberties of women\".\n\n \n Well, frankly, this leaves me even more confused than before. How is secular law supposed to \"take seriously religious motivation\"? Secular law should stick to secular issues, and leave religious opinionation to private citizens and their armies of clerics. \n \n There is nothing preventing Jews or Muslims, or even Christians, for that matter, from taking their religious disputes to religious courts or arbitrators, and voluntarily abiding by their decisions, if that is what they want to do. If they want their marriage, for example, to operate under church, synagogue or Sharia rules, they can already do that, without state sanction. If they are wise, however, they won't allow secular government to stick its nose in their tent. They shouldn't rely on secular law to back up or enforce their theological views and beliefs. It's a bad precedent, and Williams should know it.",

It's giving such courts secular, legal teeth that is objectionable, because it removes all notion of equality before the law if you have one law for one sector of the population, and a different one for another.\n \n Religious courts are perfectly acceptable for religious people who want them, but they shouldn't take the place of secular courts, nor should they be cause to evade any legal obligations a citizen might have to a duly constituted, secular authority. As long as it is understood that religious courts do not replace secular law, but are an additional system voluntarily obeyed by religious believers, the same way they obey the Ten Commandments, for example, then I can't see any objection.",
