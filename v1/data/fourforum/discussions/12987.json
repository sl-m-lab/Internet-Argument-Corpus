   "\n I am not promoting suicide but the right to die when dignity.\n\n \n It's suicide whether or not it's death with dignity. \n \n Otherwise, I agree, though I personally question (without supporting the imposition of a law on anyone) a well-off individual choosing to take their life because they were losing their hearing and vision.\n \n I certainly don't think people should be driven into such decisions for financial reasons. There was a U.S. case where the person's decision rested partly, at least, on the enormous medical bills that would be left behind for his family for the sake of but another 6 months of life, which was going to be life with pure suffering and agony.\n \n Can you imagine if someone (not well off like a famous maestro) were going blind and deaf under the U.S. health care system, with a spouse about to go into a long death by cancer, and with no one to take care of them -- in our Christian nation?\n \n Of course, in France, the state would be sending someone into the home to take care of either of them, if so desired. \n \n \nIt is interesting that so far as I know, only Switzerland a civilized by any definition of the word, country upholds this right.\n\n \n Physician assisted suicide is now legal in at least two states in the U.S. I think those laws are correct. I don't think the Maestro would have qualified here, though. His wife, perhaps.\n \n Whether or not the right to die by one's own hand exists, there's not much to stop a person, is there? If they know what they're doing and make that decision. The law makes it easier, however, and for their families as well.\n \n Which I suppose is where the dignity part comes in.\n \n There was a rather chilling sci fi movie I vaguely recall from childhood, however. The name escapes me. A futuristic society where they consumed food supplements and barely knew what a real tomato or head of lettuce was. There were no sick or elderly people for long, because when one reached a certain age, you just reported in to this beautiful, sterile, modern center -- where they were really nice to you -- gave you a last supper of superb foods you never knew existed -- brought you into this room where you lay on a bed and on a deluxe television screen all over the walls and ceiling, watched a film of your choice -- scenes of nature, your favorite music -- incredible stereophonic sound, etc. -- after being injected with a drug that put you quietly to sleep and death. And people were conditioned, in the society, to look forward to this point and go willingly to their end in this manner.",

You Americans did.\n You use them to dehumanize people who are not Anglos and treat them accordingly.\n\n \n I am an American and I think these are horrible terms. Do not forget either that the recipients of these labels are Americans, too (with the exception of the Iraq example, of course). Americans of all backgrounds have also been pioneers in civil rights, and in a manner that is unsurpassed, internationally. \n \n I am not disagreeing that there is racism or discrimination in the United States, or as to the terrible legacy of slavery and Jim Crow -- as clearly evidenced by Katrina. And how the Bush administration responded (or rather, didn't). Other places you can see institutionalized racism and classism (regardless of race) at work in the U.S. are in the healthcare system (and also, of course, education). But healthcare is extraordinarily segregated in the U.S. And a big secret here that no one wants to talk about. Left or right. Though most agree what the solution should be, across parties (whether or not it's understood that this would also address the segregation of races and classes). (Now everyone knows this exists in education, and I think few would deny that. There's a shared recognition of a problem, though there's disagreement all over the place on solutions.)\n \n \nIn another forum your 'friend' \"baron' called Obama a \"n-i-g-g-er\" and he joked that the White House should change name if Obama was elected.

To register children in public schools, parents generally provide some form of identification, innoculation records, and show proof of what district or area they live in.\n \n When students attend at the university level, they may optionally identify themselves ITO ethnicity for the school's research purposes or scholarship programs. Though many people decline entirely unless it is specifically related to their eligibility for affirmative action or scholarships.\n \n \nI don't know about Central America. In Chile is not like that. Of course we have classes but not along racial lines.\n\n \n I read an article once where the author described horrendous racism in Mexico, along with classism. Peoples who descended from indigenous groups being especially vulnerable. He shared this scene where a family went out to a restaurant with their housekeeper, who was of an indigenous background. The restaurant refused to serve them, and this was reportedly a common and acceptable practice. She was the maid, they knew that, and wasn't supposed to dine there with the family. Unheard of in the U.S. nowadays. As far as my experience is concerned. Another shocking detail, if I recall correctly, was the common sale of these \"sambo\" dolls. Or very racist charicatures on product labels that have long left the States as racist and unacceptable. There was a lot of stuff in this article, I can't remember it fully. But it was pretty disgusting to read about.\n \n \nI don't know about the Canadians, I suppose they are a cross between a Pom and a Yank. I have only been in Saskatoon, Vancouver, Calgary, Banf, Toronto and Quebec and Montreal.\n The French-Canadians were atrocious. They treated us like s*** because we didn't speak French. The Anglo Canadians were OK.\n\n \n I don't know what \"a Pom\" is. But for someone who is talking about how others are prejudiced, Winston, you sure throw these terms around a lot.\n \n I have only had good experiences with French-Canadians as a visitor. In one case, I remember being treated very well because I was making an effort to speak French (that was during the movement to have French established officially as another language). In more recent years, treated in a very warm and friendly way, and I was only speaking English. In general, I've found Canadians quite open-minded and progressive, for example, on social issues like health care and quality of life. They have higher expectations for themselves than Americans, and it shows in their society, as a result.\n \n \nThe US instead is the land of Capitalism and &#8216;every poor man for himself&#8217; but of course the Government take good care of the rich, specially the Wall Street robbers and specially so under a Republican administration.\n\n \n Well, we have little disagreement there, though I still hold out with hope (and perhaps foolishly) for my country. But we're being ruled, squeezed, and sold down the river by the large, greedy and ruthless corporations. Ordinary Americans, and of all kinds of backgrounds, are really getting ********. People are very concerned about what the future has in store for themselves, their children and their grandchildren. The Republicans look worse, but the Democrats are not so great these days, either. I've been lifetime Democrat, and I'm sort of borderline (?) Independent, these days. Perhaps totally, soon. I'm just getting fed up with their ********, too. Healthcare having a lot of influence. Out of my three Congressional representatives, two still have my support, but one, definitely getting the boot. I am so sorry I voted for this individual. And twice. I don't care if a Republican is the only candidate running against him. I wouldn't check off his name on the box any sooner than he would respond to my communications as a constituent. I certainly hope some better people are looking to break in, on the Old Boys' Club, for a change. If not, it's no skin off my nose because they're doing anything for me or mine anyway. So why should I help them have their cozy jobs with nice salaries and deluxe healthcare plans, etc etc? I know a lot of others who are fed up with their Democratic representatives in this same way, and, especially on healthcare. Especially the ones too lazy to respectfully answer their mail. Or do their jobs, for a change.\n \n I hope they're reading. (Though I won't hold my breath. They're probably at the golf course or sitting in the sauna together.) They are the straws that are finally breaking the camel's back. Pour moi. \n \n With the exception of some outstanding men, the Democrats are really nothing without their women representatives. Their entire reputation as anything Democrat is actually based on a very small number of people in office.",

   "&#8226; When people are harassed and bullied for a long time, and the authorities turn a blind eye because of political considerations, then of course when people react, things can get out of hand. But you never saw in the media Arabs harassing women who did not behave or dressed in accordance to the way they are forced to do in Saudi Arabia. You also didn&#8217;t read about the bashing of white Australians and life-savers. Every time the Moslems make the news for reasons such as gang shootings, brawls for control of a Mosque, rape, drive by shootings, the Islamic community produces to the public a sweet Arab girl who is studying at University, but never the hooligans.

I don't expect passage of a sensible bill like H.R. 676, but I am hopeful that President Obama's reform with a public option will go through.\n\n \n \n \n Antonia, here in Australia people often asks you, but not as often as before, the moment they detect your accent is not Australian, or one they can recognize, such as British, where do you come from?\n Even my daughter who was born and raised here is asked the question. And when she answers it, then she is asked \"yes, but where are your parents from?\"\n Europeans are different. Europeans are tribal, and what matters there is the surname, your surname defines you. My surname is German so when I lived in Germany, I was one of them and they treated me accordingly. I am one of them on my father's side. I was in Germany when the Russian tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia, the Americans placed their troops into war footing and the autobahns were crowded with US convoys moving east. I would have joined the German army in case of war. My mother called me and asked me to go back home. I refused. To me Germany was my homeland as much as Chile. It still is. \n There was this Polish guy, who thought I was Jewish. And he disliked me, although many were the times I helped repair equipment he couldn't on his own. He disliked me for being German and for being Jewish. He thought I was smart because I was Jewish. I am not smart and I am not Jewish. I wish I were, for then I would be smart, maybe.\n In Australia, as you can see, there are Australians (Anglos) and there is the rest. I remember a long time ago, an Hungarian guy at work, became naturalised Australian and proudly told at lunch, that he was now an \"Aussie'. An Australian sitting at the table, answered him: \"You are not an Aussie, you are a bloody Hungarian, mate! An Aussie with that accent, no way\".\n The guy was rude but honest.\n Things have changed dramatically now. I don't pretend to be born Australian. But I love Australia, I love this land. I miss it when I am away even for a couple of weeks. To me Sydney is my home. We bought a beautiful house in a nice suburb, we lack nothing. Our children are both professionals, earn good money and are happy in Australia. They are happy we moved here and that they were born here.\n I remember once in the Amsterdam zoo, I saw alone in a cage this lonely Australian kookaburra and I felt so sad for him. I was going back in a few weeks, but s(he) ?\n I always remember it when I see kookaburras, almost daily here. They are my favourite birds. \n I have nothing against Christian Lebanese. I worked for years with an Australian Lebanese engineer and they don't come smarter than him. Our car mechanic is Lebanese, a great guy who has fixed our Volvos when the mechanics at the dealership couldn't. \n I am not racist at all. I treat everyone the same. I think everyone ought to be treated the same and given the same opportunities. I think, I know from experience that intelligence is not a race thing. There are intelligent people everywhere, of all races, men and women of course.\n Society should not be divided along racial fault lines like in the USA and neither along class lines such as in the UK.\n I also think that there ought to be a social safety net for those of us who are poor. People don't want to be poor, nobody does. But sometimes we take a fall and can't recover. Then the state should help.\n That is why I find laudable your interest in universal health care.\n Oh! I forgot to tell you this. My father who was a brilliant (not like me) mechanical engineer, was offered a job at General Motors, in the 1940's during the war years. He was so keen to move to the USA, he learnt English in preparation but the US government denied him a visa for he was German. \n Maybe the US government saved my a** for I was a member of the Vietnam generation since I was born a year after the war ended in Germany. I wouldn't have avoided the draft, and probably the 'gooks' would have made mince meat out of me. emoticon_xkill",

My nationality is Australian. \n Many Chileans who settled in Australia decided to have dual nationality. I didn't, for Australia accepted me and my wife when we most needed it, so I am grateful to Australia and my allegiance lies with this land.

I don't bother to answer baron. \n \n What I find ironic is that your good friend 'baron' whom you defend is German and you have always insulted Germany. Anyone who cares to read your postings at DS will read that you call Germany, \"the land of Goebbels\". Care to deny it? I can prove it.\n \n \n \n \nPrehaps you were projecting your racist views on Baron, after all you were born & raised in Chile which is a racist & class ridden society and it shows in your distaste for minorities which you display in private.\n\n \n why are you lying, mae? you well know it isn't true. \n \n Anyway, that you have adressed me directly is something of a surprise and this is an understatement.\n \n I have no animosity against you, and my actions and words are proof of it. How can I hate someone who loves the poetry of my compatriot Neruda? \n \n Why do you and baron hate me so much?\n \n Peace.",
