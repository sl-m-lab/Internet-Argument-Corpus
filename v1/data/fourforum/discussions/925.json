   "A scenario of how religion might have started\n \n When an animal stays with it's parent, it has the distinct advantage of being able to copy it's parents behaviour. When this happens the animal for the first time doesn't need all the information and tools to survive in its genes. It can learn from it's parent. Now for an animal to learn from it's parent it needs not to be scared. It needs to be able to trust and vice versa for the parent. You need trust to form a bond. Now the brain rewards for trust.

   "The fact that civilizations for thousands and thousands of years have in almost all cases, believed in a god or gods, only reassures me that there must be some sort of \"higher being\" in charge of our orderly universe that has been revealing himself to mankind for thousands of years.\n \n\n \n I suppose you can see it this way if you wish. However, I believe that it only shows how willing we are to accept that there is a God even if there is absolutely no proof of him. Christianity at least can fall back on the theory that Jesus, son of God, has been to Earth and that he performed miracles in the name of God proving that there is a greater power out there. But before those times there was no evidence or any reason to believe in a God at all yet people did it anyways. Also people like David Koresh have proven that people will accept even a common man as a messiah of sorts even if he cannot prove anything. I'm not saying that God doesn't exist simply because we accept higher beings so easily and without proof, but I think that you have to consider this side of human psychology in a debate as to whether God probably does or doesn't exist.\n \n \nNo the answer is not \"clearly no\". You didnt even back yourself up and you claim that it is already proven that your opinion is right. \n \n I have yet to have heard of a religion anywhere in the world that does not include supernatural beings in it. So I cant see how religion could exist without God. And this is irrelevant regardless, because nothing can exist without God.\n\n \n Clearly no as in God doesn't need to exist for us to worship him. Lets pretend that there is no God for a moment yet you believe there is. Since there is no God in this scenario, does that mean that you won't believe he exists? Of course not. There doesn't have to be a God for religion to exist. Religions have formed for thousands of years worshipping Gods that today we don't believe exist. There doesn't have to be any reason behind religion. Thats all I was trying to say.\n \n However, you can have religions without a deity. You may not declare it a religion because it doesn't fall under your definition of a religion, but it could exist.\n \n Edit: I think I thought of an example of this. Take a fiercely patriotic American who salutes the flag every day, folds it up every night and says the pledge of allegiance day in and day out. He would die to protect it and lives his life by what it stands for. He preaches its glory to everyone. Isn't that a religion without a deity? It is a belief the an American flag is more important than life itself and that salvation can be found as long as it still flies. Does this fall under your definition of religion? In my opinion I'd say this can be considered religious although we simply call it patriotic.\n \n Nothing can exist without God assuming God created everything. However, even this idea is based on a poor understanding of God since even creationists will tell you that they have no idea what God is because they cannot possibly understand him.\n \n \nYou almost make naturalistic science seem like a religion here. I disagree, science isnt a religion. But according to your definition it is. Some scientists dont believe in God and are seeking answers for their questions about the origin of life and so forth. Does that make a religion. No.\n\n \n Religion can be a worship of anything. Are Chicago Bulls fanatics part of a religion? Some of them may claim that they are because of their worshipping of the team or the belief in a supernatural power that helps the team. Religion is a loose term in my opinion. If I believed that there was a supernatural power that was encompassed in the body of Michael Jordan in his prime and I worshipped him for it, is that religious? Religion requires only the idea of worshipping a supernatural force, not the actual act of worshipping one. For instance, is the worshipping of Buddha religious? You probably don't believe Allah or Buddha exist just as you may not believe that Michael Jordan is a God, so how do you separate which one is religious and which one isn't? It is simply based on your perception and yours is skewed towards Christianity and larger religious bases while mine may be skewed towards believing in the human capacity to become more than human.\n \n PS I don't think Jordan is a God... I seen him miss those dunks <:(",

   "give me your definition of religion then please fallingupwards :)\n \n on the subject of civilizations beleiving in gods for thousands of years, well yeah your right. but why do they all beleive in gods. and gods from the sun, stars, moon, and mythical gods. all these are an answer to a question that people can't answer.\n \n imagine you are alive 5000 years ago. now all of a sudden the ground near you splits open into a volcano. now if you had never seen a volcano or heard about it, what would you think? you'd probably be pretty scared, and wonder why and what it is. now you've asked yourself a question, and when humans ask themselves questions they want an answer, called closure. who is going to supply that answer, nobody. so that leaves it open to speculation. now a volcano being such a huge thing, it's going to need a big answer.\n \n so translated into english from whatever form of communication early man used.\n \n might go something like this.\n \n \"whats that huge mountain thing with loads of red liquid coming out of it. it doesn't look good lets run. what on earth is it, who or what caused it\" there you go start of speculation, hence maybe why we have so many different religions.\n \n we humans have our instincts. a human being is basically interested in \"Why\". why did that happen why did this happen. the reason we learn about our environment is for our own survival. so eventually it'll get to \"why are we here\", and how many people wonder that, pretty much everyone i would say. whether they answer it with religion or something else, we wonder why we are here.",

In fact you probably got that right out of the dictionary. Here are a couple other definitions found below that definition.\n \n #1: The life or condition of a person in a religious order.\n --Definition of religious: Having or showing belief in and reverence for God or a deity.\n --Definition of deity: The essential nature or condition of being a god.\n --Definition of God: (second definition, not primary) A being of supernatural powers or attributes, believed in and worshiped by a people, especially a male deity thought to control some part of nature or reality.\n --Definition of supernatural: Of or relating to existence outside the natural world. Attributed to a power that seems to violate or go beyond natural forces.\n \n Translation: The life or condition of a person in an order believing in the existence of a being with powers that seem to violate or go beyond natural forces.\n \n Using this string of definitions, the worshiping of Michael Jordan as a God is valid if I believed he was in control of supernatural powers and therefore would be constituted as religion.\n \n For the flag worshipping scenario I'd have to use this definition of God:\n An image of a supernatural being; an idol.\n \n Supernatural in that America is a Godly nation, better than any other nation for supernatural reasons and the flag is the idol. In this case the worshipping of the flag would be religious.\n \n Here are two other definitions of religion.\n #2: A set of beliefs, values, and practices based on the teachings of a spiritual leader.\n \n So if someone claiming to be spiritual were to teach something to people who believed he was spiritual, that would be religious regardless of what the deity was.\n \n #3: A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion.\n \n This alone is ambiguous enough to make anything religious as long as you really wanted it to be.\n \n So there are many definitions of what religion actually is. Since I don't believe in the Christian God anyways, I can step back and look at people that are in my view worshipping something that doesn't exist. This really affects my view of what is religious since I find it hard to believe that people believe in what they are doing so strongly yet as far as I can tell they are simply talking to the wall and calling it religion. You probably see the same thing with other religions such as Muslim and Buddhist since you will see them strongly worshipping something that doesn't even exist meaning they are essentially doing what is equivalent to talking to a wall and hoping something good will come out of it.\n \n That is religion in my opinion. It is the believe that you are accomplishing something because you believe you are regardless if you get any results. If I believe I am helping my team by praying (strongly hoping) for them to no deity in particular, that is religious. If I am praying to the American flag for America to succeed in a war, that is religion. If I am praying to God in hopes that he will come to me, that is religion. You will agree that the first two are not going to have any affect other than prove that I am worshipping a false idol and your God will smite me. Yet it is in my nature to want to believe strongly in the idea that I am helping by believing.

Now an inevitable consequence of learning from the parent is that the offspring will live with the parent for longer and longer, until at some point the offspring outlive their parent...Hence the birth of religion, appease themselves.\n\n \n And when are we to expect the birth of the religion of dogs? and of dolphins? of whales and lions?\n \n \nAnd we know that people thought about their dead relatives, because 160,000 years ago man was carrying around the polished skulls of what are probably dead relatives. Now that pre-dates modern religions by a very long way. all thats happened since then is the story has been created from generation to generation\n\n \n Now the man carrying around skulls pre-dates modern religion but does he pre-date \"primitive religion?\" How do you know that \"primitive\" man did not have religion?",

   "I think that intelligence is a hard thing to mesure reliably. But level of education isn't. It is a fact that has been determined by several polls the higher the level of education the more likely a person is to be an atheist. Well, perhaps I shouldn't say it that way because I've never actually looked at the results from that point of view. The more educated a person is the less likely he is to be a creationist. In spite of what creationists may tell you, to reject creationism is not to be an atheist.\n \n A lot of other findings also correlate with belief in creationism. Income. Creationists tend to make less. Of course, this is obviously not a cause and effect thing since this is probably linked more directly to education.\n \n Generally a creationist is less educated, less affluent, more rural, southern, and black. Understand that is not to say that all creationists are less educated or southern or black. That is most definitely not the case. Even at that, it depends on in what you are educated. Scientists tend to not be creationists, with about 99% of biologists rejecting creationism. Geologists also have a high number who reject creation. The highest number of creationists is among chemists. Overall, some 95% of college graduates in science reject creationism.\n \n But before anyone gets upset and shrilly screams that I haven't \"proved\" anything, let me say this. I haven't proved anything. Those are just statistics - demographics. Gallup does his poll about every two years and several others have been done and they always show the same thing.\n \n But even the above is not to say that some very highly educated scientists cannot believe in God. A well known biology professor makes no bones about his belief in God. He even wrote a book about it (which makes him a best selling author too). He doesn't presume to dictate to God how He must do his work. He teaches evolutionary biology at a major univesity and has written several biology text books.",

You will have a lot more questions that are answered using logic than you will those which are answered based on your belief although you will have some of both. Plus religion is kept out of a lot of schools which may tend to change ones view on religion in a social environment.

Your link shows that some scientists do not believe in God. I would be interested to know the limitations of the studies. It seems to be a small sample size for one thing (1000 in the 1914 study, only 400 \"great scientists\" were sent surveys with a return rate of 70% so this means that he had 280 responders, the most recent study Nature  cited that they performed included 517 \"great scientists\" with a 50% return rate meaning they ended up with 258 scientists) . The other question I have is if this population of scientists can be generalized to the entire population of scientists. Are they a diverse sample? That is, are they heavily weighted in biology, chemistry, medicine, genetics, etc. They mention scientists from several fields but I wonder how they are proportionally represented. Can this group of NAS scientists of the latest survey be generalized to the population of scientists in the world or in the U.S. even? What about other variables that might affect the person's beliefs? Could this scientist have had a bad experience with religion as a child? Are there family, emotional, cultural issues involved. My point being, can the survey truly isolate educational level as the sole factor of disbelief? You do have evidence to support your assertion. I'm just not quite sure how strong the evidence is.\n \n Your definition of education also seems to be limited to the scientific realm--and particularly scientists (I understand your reasoning for this). But what if one is highly \"educated\" in literature or art and forms his beliefs due to his intimacy with the creative work of man. What about medical doctors who are not in research but see the intricacy of the body in their daily patient interactions? Perhaps an engineer may appreciate the incidence of design in the world and relate it to his work and education. \n \n I agree that it is difficult and time-consuming to educate oneself. But you are looking at only one perspective of religion. Often religion requires following a difficult moral code. Sometimes it would be easier to relinquish the faith rather than follow it. It requires time, effort, and sacrifice to do charitable works, including dangerous missionary work, participating in church activities, learning the faith, etc. You may not have been implying this. But I want to make the point that the religious are not couch potatoes hanging out doing nothing. Sometimes religion is an easy, lazy road. Sometimes it is the difficult one. Sometimes atheism is the easy, lazy road. Sometimes it is the difficult one.\n \n Peace.",

Such a great saint as Augustine swears that he saw: a blind child restored to sight by the relics of Saint Gervaise and Saint Protasius at Milan; a woman in Carthage cured of a cancer by the sign of the cross made by a woman who had just been baptised; his close friend Hesperius driving off devils (who were infesting his house) by using a little soil taken from the sepulchre of our Lord, and that same soil, borne into the Church, suddenly curing a paralytic; a woman who, having touched the reliquary of Saint Stephen with a posy of flowers during a procession, rubbed her eyes with them afterwards and recovered her sight which she had recently lost...
