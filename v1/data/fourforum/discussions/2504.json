I am not sure of the prestige among researchers of that particular journal.\n \n \nHeterosexual men, on a rate of violence scale, do treat women better than lesbians treat each other.\n\n \n I don't see how you have made that assumption.\n \n \nIf the number of violent actions is greatest against women, and women have an increased rate of violence in lesbian relationships that doesn't speak too well of how lesbians treat each other.\n\n \n I don't believe you have proven that lesbians have a greater rate of violence.

That would seem to not say good things about men in intimate relationships. \n \n \nYou can't get away from the Bureau of Justice Statistic, Jake.\n\n \n I am not trying to get away from anything. I gave a detailed examination of the study. I explained why \"married women\" is not the only category that applies to heterosexual women with \"intimates\".
