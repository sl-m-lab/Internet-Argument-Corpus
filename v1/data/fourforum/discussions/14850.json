   "Uh oh. The Navy dude dared have an anti-gay slur and now the PC police media are drumming it up!\n Navy investigates raunchy videos; some at odds over future of captain - CNN.com\n\n \n ..... You fail to see or realize the standard the US Navy holds at the very foundation for it's Officer Corps. You would not see the likes of George Patton, Or Admiral Mullen making such videos.\n \n Regardless of the reasoning behind it these men are held to stricter codes of conduct than regular enlisted men. And the higher the rank, the greater the responsibility and ethical manner involved.\n \n I am not stating this because of the nature of the video. it is because this XO should have had far better judgment to for see that this conduct would be seen as inappropriate in light of his duties on the Enterprise.",

   "Should the commander be relived of duty over something like this? The troops loved the videos, apparently. I think if this were over anything else but the the gay issue, the media wouldn't be calling for this guy's head. As usual, the PC nutters in this country are over-reacting. This country is turning into an orwellian mess where we try to sanitize having to hear anything that offends peoples' fragile sensitivities ...",

   "USS Enterprise Capt. Owen Honors Navy Video\n \n Apparently CNN got in a hurry to make the news.. This report says they did not remove him of his command.\n \n Although I don't agree with the content of the Videos I do think the media is blowing this way out of proportion. The videos were only meant to boost the moral and taken out of context. Bad form on the Captains part but He shouldn't be stripped of his command . Not to mention these Videos are 3 years old , it seems someone is trying to cause a stir now that DADT has been repealed. Why else would they wait this long to bring these videos forward.",

Acatully they are a little bit funny. If I take anything from them Honors is a closet case. They did have several men showering together soaping each other up but I did not see an anti gay response, more like ok boys let me have some too.",

So lets let the people in charge of the XO do their job and sit back. If you want my opinion of should he be relived of his command?\n \n Honestly I do not know. I do not know where this video exactly violates the UCMJ so I couldn't even begin to form an educated opinion.",
