   "TV channel \"Kanal 5\" of Macedonia reports that radical Islam is spreading in this country. \n According to Macedonian police, numerous fundamental groups mainly consisting of Chechen insurgents from Republic of Ichkeria are arriving in Macedonia through the territory of Ukraine, Poland, BiH and Kosovo where they had arrived to from Georgia. There are already too many of them, Macedonian police official said, and they have already penetrated Lipkovski and Veles regions, form contacts with local Moslems and entice them to join their radical movements. \n It is interesting how European analytics explain the fact that all of a sudden Chechens started to arrive in numbers into Macedonia. According to them, there is a whole department in Georgia dedicated to denizing of foreigners (namely Chechens) that was headed by Irakli Chubinishvili in 2004 who actively lobbied concerns of Chechen insurgents who in their turn had an ultimate aim of migration to Europe, Turkey or the US. At the present day, this committee is headed by Chubinishvili's brother - Nick Chubinishvili - but still Irakli indirectly curates Chechen matters as well as trade in arms and people and drug trafficking. Besides, similar committees for European fusion were opened under the auspices of Irakli Chubinishvili in Poland, Ukraine and Kosovo that also help Chechen militants to migrate to Eastern Europe.",
