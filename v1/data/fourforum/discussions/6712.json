When a media reporter asked about Fox's \"dominance,\" Parsons probably wished that he was stomping grapes in Italy instead of fielding questions.\n \n But company-man that he is, Parsons managed to issue what sounded (to me) like an emphatically lukewarm review. \"'Dominance' is a strong word,\" Parsons began cautiously, measuring his words like the corporate lawyer he used to be.\n \n Parsons then said he \"can foresee\" a day when CNN takes back the ratings lead from Fox -- but tactfully declined to specify in what year (or decade -- or century) that might occur.\n\n \n More of the same from the CNN heads...FNC is dominating them, we know it, Fox knows it, and CNN knows it.",

   "It's refreshing to hear I'm not the only one who thinks CNN and it's reporters tend to be slanted.\nAlmost all reporters are slanted. The only way to get news today without the additional slant of the station or the reporter is to subscribe to UPI or AP and get it directly from them. That's where most of the news you read in the papers comes from. Even they will be slanted a bit because there's always human involvement in making up the text. BBC has been known to have a liberal slant now and then, too. Jim Lehrer is close to untainted but...like I said, there's a slant to everything produced by \"journalists\". The best and most truthful news facts usually come from the nitwits that get interviewed at the scene on TV, or from the police reports, written and verbal.",
