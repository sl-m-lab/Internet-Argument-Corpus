   "White House Indicates it Has No Intention of Repealing 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' This Year - Towleroad, More than gay news. More gay men\n \n At a White House press briefing today, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs indicated that the President is committed to waiting for the Pentagon to finish its \"study\" on \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" before actively pushing for repeal, effectively pushing it into 2011.\n \n So, while the repeal could conceivably be attached to a Department of Defense authorization bill to be considered next month, in line with the President's promise made in the State of the Union address, this is the clearest indication yet that no support will be coming from the White House on that.\n \n Transcript, and video, AFTER THE JUMP...\n \n The hopeful news is that there are a growing number of Democrats in Congress who say they are unwilling to wait for the lengthy military study, as evidenced by Senator Udall's statement I posted earlier today. \n \n David Mixner reports: \"I have spent the day visiting on the phone with extremely reliable sources on Capitol Hill in both the Senate and House. With over twenty calls, I have been able to determine that the revolt is perhaps much larger than the media realizes. There is a sense of total frustration with the administration. They just don't understand why the White House won't move on this issue. Many of persons on the Hill that I spoke too are from states with large urban populations, including in the South. They feel the failure to vote this year on DADT will have a 'chilling effect' regarding voter turn out in the Fall elections. Those interviewed think that not only will many LGBT citizens stay home but also other progressives.\"\n \n TRANSCRIPT:\n \n Q Let me get back to the question. So there was the heckling on Monday night, there's the veterans yesterday at the White House gates handcuffing themselves to the fence. All of these actions are aimed at getting repeal this year, something the White House has sort of declined to commit to since the State of the Union address. Has the White House misjudged the level of patience among LGBT and grassroots activists on this?\n \n MR. GIBBS: No. Again, I would remind anybody on this issue -- look, first of all, I will say this. Obviously the President made a commitment in the presidential campaign, and understands the passion that people hold the belief that all should be able to serve. The President holds that belief too.\n \n But I would remind folks that wasn't a belief that the President held in 2007 -- that's a belief that the President held in running for the Senate as far back as 2003.\n \n The President has made and is committed to making this changed law. I don't think he's underestimated the -- as you said, the patience of some. The President wants to see this law changed, just as you've heard the Chair of the Joint Chiefs and others in the military say that it's time for that change to happen. \n \n Q But he's committed to them letting the Pentagon work through its working group process until December 1st, is that true? He's committed to that?\n \n MR. GIBBS: Yes. The President has set forward a process with the Joint -- the Chair of the Joint Chiefs and with the Secretary of Defense to work through this issue.\n \n Q Before any legislative action is taken -- that rules out legislative action this year?\n \n MR. GIBBS: Well, again -- the House and the Senate are obviously a different branch of government. The President has a process and a proposal I think that he believes is the best way forward to seeing, again, the commitment that he's made for many years in trying to -- changing that law.",

   "I have to disagree with you on this one. \n \n Personally, I dont care if a person is gay, straight, or likes to perform sexual acts with a slightly warm melon. I just cant get up the energy to care even a little bit. Unless they are doing it with me, it has nothing to do with me and therefore is none of my business. \n \n That said, I dont think that a dont ask dont tell policy in combat units is a bad idea. I would go so far as to say that removing gays from combat units should probably be acceptable. \n \n A LOT of people DO care about an individuals sexual orientation. For some reason that I am really completely unable to fathom, they care very deeply about it. In almost all cases I would say \"they can get over it\". When you are talking a front line combat unit you are talking about a unit that must act as a close team every minute of every day. You are also talking about a unit that can be wiped out completely because some half retarded redneck is paying more attention to hating the XXXXX next to him than he is to where he is going and what he is doing. \n \n This is the same reason I have advocated barring ipods and video games on combat patrols.\n \n Is it fair? No. Does it victimize gays? You betcha. Is it likely to save lives? Absolutely. \n \n If we could weed out all the half retarded rednecks instead, I would be all for it. Unfortunately that would leave us with a SEVERE manpower shortage in the military. We may as well just scrap the marine corps on day one.\n \n I did discuss this with some of my old friends from the military and we came up with another solution. Form a gay combat corps. Gay men can join right up, but allow straight men to volunteer for the unit. We pretty much came to the conclusion that it would either be the best unit in the entire military or the absolute worst because for a gay guy to decide to enlist he has to be either extremely dedicated and extremely brave, or he has to be extremely stupid.",

Imbeciles.\n \n Revisiting Liberal Myths &#8211; Reagan and the Deficit\n \n President Reagan entered the White House with an attitude of working honest deals with the Congress on spending.

However, despite getting concessions on taxes, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives never once cut spending, and the actual budgets were higher than what Reagan asked for 7 out of 8 years.

In addition, income tax revenues increased during this period and the share of taxes paid by the rich increased also! In other words, the liberals have been lying to you. \n \n The Reagan Information Page:The Tax Cuts\n \n The smallest amount by which a Reagan budget was increased by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives was $50 billion. The government shut down on numerous occasions because of budget battles between Reagan and Congress. Interestingly, back then no one blamed the Speaker of the House for shutting down the government. They blamed the President. \n \n When Reagan&#8217;s tax plan was passed in 1982, there were supposed to be two dollars in spending cuts for every dollar of tax cuts. But spending never got cut. In the end, for every new dollar of tax revenue, the Democrats spent $1.80.
