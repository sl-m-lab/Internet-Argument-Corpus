   "War general: gay, straight should be OK to serve | News Story on 365gay.com\n \n \n By The Associated Press\n 02.22.2010 3:34pm EST\n \n (Washington) The top commanding general in Iraq says he thinks everyone - gay and straight - should be allowed to serve in the military \"as long as we are still able to fight our wars.\"\n \n \n The comment by Gen. Raymond Odierno (Oh-dee-AIR-no) is among the first to come from a senior military leader currently leading troops in battle since the Pentagon announced earlier this month that it will study the issue.\n \n Odierno helped lead a troop buildup in Iraq that reduced violence and has paved the way for a planned reduction of U.S. forces.\n \n Odierno told reporters Monday that he hadn't had much time to think about whether gays should be allowed to serve openly. He said the policy of \"don't ask, don't tell\" has been a \"non-issue\" to him.",
