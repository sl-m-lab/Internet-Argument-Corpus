Very enlightening. I personally have met several intellectual types with the same condescending attitude. My question is, if these people are so enlightened and intellectually superior to the rest of us, how come none of them do anything productive that generates revenue, helps grow the economy, makes the world a better place or builds something that will last for the next hundred years? They all seem to teach as some high school or university, sucking at the national nipple when they could be our amassing huge fortunes, couldn't they?\n \n http://www.gospelcom.net/chi/pastwords/chl183.shtml\n That good angels have appeared, is certain; though that instance of those to Abraham may admit of a various construction; some divines supposing them to be the Trinity; others, that they were men-messengers, as Judges ii. 1, and others, that they were angels. But though this, as I said, might admit of a debate, yet I see no question of the angel Gabriel's appearance, particularly to the blessed virgin; for though the angels are spirits, and so not perceptible by our bodily eyes without the appointment of the Most High, yet he, who made all things by his word in the creation, can with a word speak things into being.\n \n http://www.rickross.com/reference/wicca/wicca44.html\n I'm a hedge witch, I make healing potions and small charms,\" Richardson said from \"Castle Pook,\" his 18th century cottage nestling on a \"coven\" of 13 acres in county Cork. Salvaged and rebuilt by Richardson and his wife Del using plenty of recycled materials, including old supermarket fridge doors for windows, from the outside, Castle Pook does not look like a witch's pad. \n Inside, however, the house is adorned with hand-carved wands, crystal balls, magic charms, and potions, the bookshelves are stuffed with tomes on mystics and fairies and at night, bats hover overhead. \n \n A stone's throw away is the real Castle Pook, an imposing 12th century stronghold, whose fairy legends are believed to have inspired the character Puck in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. \n \n To celebrate festivals such as Halloween and the Pagan New Year referred to as Samhain, Richardson swaps his jeans for his ceremonial white-hooded gown and goes barefoot into the forest for a \"circle\" ceremony of prayer. The Richardsons have developed Castle Pook into a kind of magic conference centre where Pagans gather to celebrate festivals, discuss their spirituality or, increasingly, take part in witchcraft workshops. \n There might not be instruction in broomstick navigation or levitation, but outside of a J.K. Rowling novel this is probably as close as you'll get to Harry Potter's Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Last month, more than 50 wizards, witches and druids congregated at Castle Pook for a weekend of ceremony and demonstrations. Spurred on by the success of these gatherings, which have attracted witches and wizards from California to Croatia, the Richardsons hope to establish a full-time witchcraft school. \n Unlike Harry Potter, Richardson's witchcraft centres around preparing herb-based healing potions and organising spiritual ceremonies for other pagans. Visitors who take part in circle ceremonies at Castle Pook have sometimes remarked on their religious flavour. Born on the Isle of Man, Richardson has been a witch since his teens, when he was attracted to the teachings of Gerald Gardiner, the late founder of the Wicca movement, which is a nature-based religion. He never uses the term \"warlock\" to describe himself as it is considered a religious slur in the Pagan community. He does not indulge in spells and has a straight forward message for anyone looking for a love potion: \"Get a life.\" \n \n \n \n What a Moot!\n \n -Mach",

   "Saying \"a bunch of religions, like, oppose this, so therefore it is, like, totallly wrong,\" is very, very fallacious. So what if Islam, Judaism, Chrisitanity, and Hinduism mandates the deprivation of civil liberties? Islam also mandates polygamy. You see, dogmatic authorities do nothing but shout assumptions.\n\n First off I'll ignore your straw-man about them depriving people of civil-liberties and address the 'shouting of assumptions'.\n \n So...\n That's not the point I was making. For argument's sake, all these religious views could be wrong. What I was arguing against was the fallacy that when one person earlier stated a view; the respondent tried to brush this aside by saying they were ONLY HIS VIEWS.\n \n It's such a big error to make, and dishonest.\n \n Now to your re-working of my argument. You seem to protest that a large number of people must pander to a minority who feel that their own sinful manners should be accepted. How's this then, would you support a minority of people who favour beastiality (which doesn't 'harm' anyone; they could say)?",

We give God room to come in and set us free from it, and this gives us the room to pour out the same love and grace upon others just as God did for us.\n \n Gods heart goes out to this lad that is haveing trouble with his mum and i hope and prey that he will look passed his mothers religiosity (if there is such a word, if not there is now) and know that there is still a God that loves him and is willing to recieve him!\n STORMY",

   "Yes homosexuallity is a sin, however I am a sinner that struggles with differant types of sin\n\n \n Thank you. What so many Christians fail to realize when they read things like the first chapter of Romans is that the accusing finger isn't being pointed somewhere else, it's being pointed at them, at all of us. There isn't a single one of us worthy of God's kingdom on his or her own merits, but we can get there through Christ. \n \n All the gay-hating Christians are doing is bothering about that speck in their brother's eye. It is not anyone's place to judge for God. You can try to guide and instruct, but the minute you ad hate you are missing the whole point of Christ.\n \n He told us love comes first and that every other law hinges on that. You act in contradiction with that and you are acting in contradiction to his will. This mother is NOT following the example of Christ. I hope she sees that some day and I hope her son finds the support he needs.",
