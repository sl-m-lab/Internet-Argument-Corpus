   "I remember reading somewhere about Lucifer and how he was God's most favortie angle. Which this is common knowledge about the whole Satan falling from heaven bit, but I think it's really interesting to simply know about Satan, not that I'm a satanist, but because I think it is wise to know your enemy. Lucifer in Greek I believe in it's original context is Hayle-lal or something to that affect, and that is very similar to the meaning of the world Halleleujeah...jeeze I can't spell....you know what I mean though. Satan was God's leader of Worship in heaven and was one of the most beutiful creations of God. As we know he fell to earth, I just think it is ironic because how popular and influential music is on earth. Music stars have more power than most people and are some of the richest people around, they can creat their own fantasy land because they are so rich, i.e. Micheal Jackson. So anyways, what are your thoughts of music today?\n \n Mudvayne, Disturbed, Lamb of God, Slipknot, and all those bands are pretty heavy and demonic, but any music can influence one's mood. My question is how much can music affect one's mental state do you think?",

   "If your final question was purely the thing you wanted to discuss than you could have just put that up there without all the stuff about Satan. So obviously you are wanting to get your idea across that Satan is trying to influence people through music. To this I say no (I guess I would have to believe in Satan first to believe that--but that's a topic for another thread).\n But to answer your final question- yes, of course, music can definitely affect one's \"mental state.\" If it didn't (and if art as a whole didn't) it wouldn't be so important to us.\n I guess other people can chime in, cuz I know I'll have more to say about this later--music is a huge passion for me.",

   "I grew up in a household where rock and roll was not allowed to be listened to. Imagine that, the early to late 60's, the most dynamic period in the history of music, and being told it was evil. The Beatles were long-haired maggots direct from Beezlebub, according to my father. Instead we listened to Country, with the drinking and cheating and all-around psychosis. Go figure. Yet when he left the house my three sisters and I would quickly change the radio dial and take in the wonderful sounds of Motown and the English invasion and all the other varieties of that period of time, my mother (may she rest in peace) allowing it and being a part of the conspiracy to rebel against authority. It remains a sore spot to this day in my relation with my father, I must honestly and sadly admit.\n \n The premise of this thread, though poorly posited, was immediately recognized by me as coming from that same well. May I only say that of all the things in life to worry about, to teach your loving children, to steer clear of, music is not one of them. Further, let your children have their own music, as you had yours.",
