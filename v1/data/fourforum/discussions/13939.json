   "His murderer, Andrew Joseph Stack III, a privileged white Texan who flew his $.25 million Piper Cherokee PA-28-236 into the building where Hunter worked and murdered him.\n \n Andrew Joseph Stack III was a whining moral coward who never served in the military.\n \nVernon Hunter, a 67-year-old IRS worker, was killed in the crash.\n \n When Ken Hunter first heard about a plane crashing into his father's office building in Austin, he said he hoped his dad, Vernon Hunter, wasn't there.\n \n \"I saw the building and that was my dad's office building. So I called maybe eight times or more,\" Ken said.\n \n But his dad never picked up the phone. A few hours later, he learned his dad was missing.\n \n \"There was just too much going on about what the guy did and what he believed in, and enough's enough,\" he said. \"They don't need to talk about him. Talk about my dad. You know, some people are trying to make this guy out to be a hero, a patriot. My dad served two terms in Vietnam. This guy never served at all. My dad wasn't responsible for his tax problems.\" \n \n Foster said Vernon Hunter was a proud Vietnam Vet and a great neighbor.\n \n \"He was just a real tender man,\" he said. \"It was always good to talk to him. He was just a nice guy.\"\n \n Now, as cars gather in front of the Hunter residence, a neighborhood braces itself and offers support.\n \n Vernon Hunter leaves behind a wife, a son and daughter and six grandchildren.\n\n Daily Kos: Son Speaks Out {UpDated w/Video and 2nd & 3rd UpDate}",
