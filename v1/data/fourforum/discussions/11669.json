   "I hear women all the time say its my body so its my choice, but shouldn the father have a say in it. If I slept with my girlfriend and she turned up pregnant, and she wanted to abort, but I want my child to raise and love, I have virtually no legal say in it. This is wrong no matter how you look at it, and yes, I do oppose abortions. Laws should be passed where the abortion can only be performed without the fathers ok if it endangers the life of the mother.\n\n You know, men abort babies all the time without even thinking about it.\n \n If a man impregnates a woman, if he doesn't want to take responsibility for his impregnation of that woman, all he has to do is walk. That's how a man does abortion -- all the time. It is very difficult to legally get a father to take responsibility for children he has fathered. \n \n As a matter of fact, there are a number of really ugly customers in men, a great number of extremely hateful men:\n \nLegal Aid for Duped Dads\n A three-step plan for protecting your name and your financial interests\n \n So you've had the paternal wool pulled over your eyes, and now you want out--of the relationship with your partner and her child. First, make sure this is really what you want and you aren't just acting out of anger, justified as it may be. If you're set on severing all ties, hire a family-law attorney. (Go to abanet.org/lawyer locator/searchlawyer.html and click on \"Location/Area of Practice.\") Then follow these court-tested tips for taking back your life.\n \n Step 1. Check the birth certificate. Every state has its own window of time during which a married man can dispute paternity. For example, in North Dakota it's 1 year from the signing of the birth certificate, while in Tennessee it's 5 years. (The exception: If the child is born out of wedlock, men usually get just 60 days.) See chart below, for the law in your state. If you're within the time frame, your lawyer will want to file an affidavit that includes paternity-test results. Time expired? Read on.\n \n Step 2. File for divorce. Untying the knot gives you a legal opening to dispute paternity, even when state law says you missed the deadline. The catch is that now an affidavit and test results aren't enough--you need to sue for fraud. \"If she's found to have committed fraud, the verdict can relieve you of custody payments,\" says attorney Michelle Kelly, a paternity expert in Michigan. Caution: You can win the suit and still be ordered to pay child support if your soon-to-be-ex isn't financially stable. In that case, go to Step 3.\n \n Step 3. Identify the real dad. Now's your chance to make the jerk pay. \"The real biological dad could be forced to pay support, but only if he is named,\" says Kelly, adding that it's often difficult to ID the guy. Hire a private detective, specifically a \"certified legal investigator\"; they specialize in gathering information for court cases.\n\n http://menstuff.org/issues/byissue/dupeddads.html\n \n Certainly, a man shouldn't be obliged to support a child that isn't his, but these so-called men are totally hysterical. And, it's all about their precious financial assets. They don't give a damn about children -- or fetuses.\n \n So, come off your hypocritical high horse.",

Weird.\n \n Now onto something a little more credible than your googling skills or comic book propaganda.\n \n Research indicates that relief is the most common emotional response following abortion, and that psychological distress appears to be greatest before, rather than after, an abortion.\n \n In 1989, the American Psychological Association (APA) convened a panel of psychologists with extensive experience in this field to review the data. \n \n The panel concluded that \"research with diverse samples, different measures of response, and different times of assessment have come to similar conclusions. The time of greatest distress is likely to be before the abortion. Severe negative reactions after abortions are rare and can best be understood in the framework of coping with normal life stress.\" While a few women may experience sensations of regret, sadness or guilt after an abortion, the overwhelming responses are relief and happiness. (ref: Adler NE, et al. \"Psychological factors in abortion: a review.\" American Psychologist, 1992, 47(10): 1194-1204).\n \n In another study (Russo NF, Zierk KL. \"Abortion, childbearing, and women's well-being.\" Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, 1992, 23: 269-280.) researchers surveyed a national sample of over 5,295 women, many of whom had abortions between 1979 and 1987, the time they were involved in the study. The researchers were able to learn about women's emotional well-being both before and after they had abortions. They concluded at the end of the eight-year study that the most important predictor of emotional well-being in post-abortion women was their well-being before the abortion. Women who had high self-esteem before an abortion would be most likely to have high self-esteem after an abortion, regardless of how many years passed since the abortion.\n \n In a commentary in the Journal of the American Medical Association (you've heard of them haven't you Galactababe) Nada Stotland, M.D., former president of the Association of Women Psychiatrists, stated:\n \n \"Significant psychiatric sequelae after abortion are rare, as documented in numerous methodologically sound prospective studies in the United States and in European countries. Comprehensive reviews of this literature have recently been performed and confirm this conclusion. The incidence of diagnosed psychiatric illness and hospitalization is considerably lower following abortion than following childbirth\"\n \n In other words Galactababe, more woman are happy after an abortion then after having a baby. Put that in your biased pipe and smoke it emoticon_xgood\n \n Further more, Doctor Nada Stotland stated \"Significant psychiatric illness following abortion occurs most commonly in women who were psychiatrically ill before pregnancy, in those who decided to undergo abortion under external pressure, and in those who underwent abortion in aversive circumstances, for example, abandonment.\"\n \n Henry P. David, PhD, an internationally known scholar in this area of research, reported the following at an international conference.\n \n \"Severe psychological reactions after abortion are infrequent. The number of such cases is very small, and has been characterized by former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop as 'minuscule from a public health perspective'...For the vast majority of women, an abortion will be followed by a mixture of emotions, with a predominance of positive feelings. This holds immediately after abortion and for some time afterward...The positive picture reported up to eight years after abortion makes it unlikely that more negative responses will emerge later.\"\n \n Russo and Dabul reported their conclusions of an eight-year study in Professional Psychology:\n \n \"Although an intensive examination of the data was conducted, controlling for numerous variables and including comparisons of Black women versus White women, Catholic women versus non-Catholic women, and women who had abortions versus other women, the findings are consistent: The experience of having an abortion plays a negligible, if any, independent role in women's well-being over time, regardless of race or religion. The major predictor of a woman's well-being after an abortion, regardless of race or religion, is level of well-being before becoming pregnant...Our findings are congruent with those of others, including the National Academy of Sciences (1975), and the conclusion is worth repeating. Despite a concerted effort to convince the public of the existence of a widespread and severe postabortion trauma, there is no scientific evidence for the existence of such trauma, even though abortion occurs in the highly stressful context of an unwanted pregnancy.\"\n \n Gee Galactababe... it appears that study after study from the worlds most renowned medical institutions bear out exactly what I stated - and go against the propaganda that your right winged rhetoric burdened religious web sites said. Wierd huh? emoticon_xgood\n \n emoticon_xbye",

   "Planned Parenthood's internal report (\"Department of Education's 3-year Plan and Long Range Goals, 1990-93\")\n\n There is no such report. Funny how only anti-choice web sites have conjured one up. Instead of acting like a parrot and repeating everything that you read on your anti-choice web sites, I challange you to post a link to the ACTUAL un-edited supposed report from the Planned Parenthood site. If it exists then you will be able to do this, but I think everyone here will find that instead of posting a link to any report, you will be posting an EXCUSE for why you couldn't find one emoticon_xgood\n \n \n its own research organization, the Alan Guttmacher Institute, estimates that as much as 91% of all women undergoing abortions may suffer from physical and psychological \"post-procedural trauma.\n\n Not true! Did you even bother to go to the SOURCE (the Alan Guttmacher Institute) and see if such a thing was true? Nope! You only went as far as repeating what your biased anti-choice web sites said, so let's all take this time and go to the ACTUAL Alan Guttmacher Institute website and see what they ACTUALLY said about this matter shall we? ...and I quote:\n \n \nMost antiabortion activists oppose abortion for moral and religious reasons. In their effort to win broader public support and legitimacy, however, antiabortion leaders frequently assert that abortion is not only wrong, but that it harms women physically and psychologically. Such charges have been made repeatedly for years, but repetition and even acceptance by members of Congress and other high-ranking political officials do not make them true.\n \n Likely because the science attesting to the physical safety of the abortion procedure is so clear, abortion foes have long focused on what they allege are its negative mental health consequences. For decades, they have charged that having an abortion causes mental instability and even may lead to suicide, and despite consistent repudiations from the major professional mental health associations, they remain undeterred. For example, the \"postabortion traumatic stress syndrome\" that they say is widespread is not recognized by either the American Psychological Association (APA) or the American Psychiatric Association.\n\n \n \nTo defend their positions, these activists often cite studies that have serious methodological flaws or draw inappropriate conclusions from more rigorous studies. Admittedly, the body of sound research in this area is relatively sparse because establishing or conclusively disproving a causal relationship between abortion and subsequent behavior is an extremely difficult proposition. Still, it is fair to say that neither the weight of the scientific evidence to date nor the observable reality of 33 years of legal abortion in the United States comports with the idea that having an abortion is any more dangerous to a woman's long-term mental health than delivering and parenting a child that she did not intend to have or placing a baby for adoption.\n \n\n \n \nDespite years of trying, antiabortion activists failed to gain any traction with the nation's major medical groups in alleging that abortion posed a direct threat to women's health, especially their mental health, so they turned to the political process to legitimize their claims. In 1987, they convinced President Reagan to direct U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop to analyze the health effects of abortion and submit a report to the president. As Koop had been appointed to his position in no small part because of his anti-abortion views, both prochoice and antiabortion factions believed the outcome to be preordained. (An eminent pediatric surgeon as well as an outspoken abortion foe, Koop had no prior experience or background in public health; both public health and prochoice advocates in Congress vehemently opposed his appointment, delaying his confirmation by several months.)\n \n Koop reviewed the scientific and medical literature and consulted with a wide range of experts and advocacy groups on both sides of the issue. Yet, after 15 months, no report was forthcoming. Rather, on January 9, 1989, Koop wrote a letter to the president explaining that he would not be issuing a report at all because \"the scientific studies do not provide conclusive data about the health effects of abortion on women.\" Koop apparently was referring to the effects of abortion on mental health, because his letter essentially dismissed any doubts about the physical safety of the procedure.\n\n \n \nAs to the mental health issue, Koop described anecdotal evidence going in both directions, but emphasized that \"individual cases cannot be used to reach scientifically sound conclusions.\" He discussed the methodological flaws pervading most of the research on this subject, and for this reason, he explained, he could reach no definitive conclusion about the mental health impact of having an abortion. Importantly, however, Koop did state that it was clear to him that the psychological effects of abortion are \"minuscule\" from a public health perspective.\n \n\n \n \nRepresenting the APA at the hearing, Nancy Adler, professor of psychology at the University of California, San Francisco, testified that \"severe negative reactions are rare and are in line with those following other normal life stresses.\" While acknowledging that there were flaws in much of the research, she testified nonetheless that the weight of the evidence persuasively showed that \"abortion is usually psychologically benign.\" Echoing Koop's point about the public health implications, Adler said that given the millions of women who had had abortions, \"if severe reaction were common, there would be an epidemic of women seeking treatment. There is no evidence of such an epidemic.\"\n\n \n Unlike you Galactababe I am willing to post a direct link to the report because I am not afraid of the truth or the facts of the matter. You are free to post more propaganda from your anti-choice web sites, and everyone else here will consider the source emoticon_xgood\n \n \n...the U.S. Senate passed an amendment...\n\n LOL emoticon_smile Is that all you have? emoticon_rolleyes Here's a news flash for you Galactababe, the US Senate is not a medical institution emoticon_xgood\n \n Here's another news flash for you Galactababe, your supposed \"post-abortion stress syndrome\" is a anti-choice MADE UP term, and is NOT recognized by either the American Psychological Association (APA) or the American Psychiatric Association! Read 'em and weep emoticon_idea\n \n \nin March the British Royal College of Psychiatrists announced a major shift in its position on the psychological impact of abortion. It acknowledged, for the first time, that women could face mental health problems after they had had abortions.\n\n I have read this entire report, but you apparently rely on your anti-choice web sites interpretations of it. What they said was, and I quote \"180 women each year are in need of support\". That's 180 women out of the total number of women involved (only) in Norfolk, England. When you factor in all of the women involved (in Norfolk, England) it shows that less than 10% of them were involved, and most of those 10% had external pressure or underwent their abortion in aversive circumstances. This is nothing new and only reinforces what I've been saying all along, that by far the MAJORITY of women find the overwhelming response to an abortion is relief and happiness. THANK YOU for proving my point emoticon_xgood\n \n OH, by the way, the same report also said \"Women who need abortions need to have them as early, safely and cheaply as possible. By cutting out time wasting bureaucracy the whole process can be speeded up, and with the money saved, birth control services can be improved.\" \n \n \"if the woman's health is taken as the most important factor when performing an induced abortion then it is wrong to link it to viability.\"\n \n In other words, just because a woman is pregnant, doesn't mean she should be forced to have a baby. I couldn't agree more emoticon_smile",

   "Regarding the credentials of the Elliot Institute: Its founder is David C. Reardon who holds a degree in electrical engineering\n\n Reardon is a known anti-choice activist, and was described in the New York Times Magazine as the \"Moses\" of the \"post-abortion movement\". The reason why Galactababe can't post any credible sources is because none exist ;)\n \n The same New York Times article stated \"Academic experts continue to stress that the psychological risks posed by abortion are no greater than the risks of carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term.\" A study of 13,000 women, conducted in Britain over 11 years, compared those who chose to end an unwanted pregnancy with those who chose to give birth, controlling for psychological history, age, marital status and education level. The researchers found that there was \"equivalent rates of psychological disorders among the two groups.\"\n \n Brenda Major, a psychology professor at the University of California followed hundreds of women ages 15 to 35 from the day they had their abortion. \n \n LESS THAN 1% of them had any stress from the abortion. The rate of clinical depression among women who had an abortion was the same as the national rate for all women ages 15 to 35. \n \n Another researcher, Nancy Adler, found that less than 10 percent of women have symptoms of depression or other psychological distress after an abortion - this is the same exact rate experienced by women after childbirth. There is no secret that pregnant women have a rush of hormones. Every year seemingly normal women commit neonaticide. The research indicates that it is these hormones from the act of being pregnant that causes stress in some women, and NOT any 'decision' about terminating said pregnancy.\n \n Anyone who has ever studied hormones knows that they are the single most powerful reaction in the human body. They control our very existence, and if you tried to remove any hormones from your body you would die within minutes. When a woman is going through the reproduction cycle, one hormone can regulate the production and release of other types of hormones. It is this \"hormone cocktail\" which some women are susceptible to which controls their feelings after they become pregnant, after an abortion or after childbirth.",

They don't give a damn about children -- or fetuses.\n \n So, come off your hypocritical high horse.\n\n \n In my opinion, any man who walks away from his child because he doesnt want the responsibility he helped to create, is not a real man in my book. I just simply feel like if I got a woman pregnant, unless she is in eminant danger from the pregnancy, that I should have just as much of a legal right as she does pertaining to an abortion. I personally would love to have some kids, so i would never walk away from my child.",

   "As usual, history, and public record PROVES you wrong archangel emoticon_xbye\n\n \n As usual, cheap lip service with evidence of nothing. And still no proof that an unborn child is a parasite. If history and public record proves me wrong, then post them for all to see if they exist. But wait, you're spreading your delusions again, so you can post nothing more to substantiate than you empty insistence that you are right. emoticon_xdonno\n \n Here is an abstract by a law Professor which attempts to restructure the debate of fetal homicide laws due to the glaring hypocrisy and inconsistent double standards which so obviously exist due to the existing right for a single individual female to have the power of life and death over her own CHILD. \n \n This article exposes the The worst problems with the fetal homicide laws that have proliferated around the nation, and are quite different than the existing scholarship suggests. Critics often argue that the statutes, which criminalize the killing of a fetus by a third party other than an abortion provider, contradict the laws which empower the abortion provider to do exactly that under the assumption that the same fetus is less than human.\n \n If in fact, her child is a non person in the womb and not worthy of civil rights which justifies her right to kill it, then why all of the outrage when a purposely pregnant woman is broad sided by a drunk, and both she and her unborn child are killed? Surely holding him responsible for just her death is enough if the abortion laws are Just, and morally right. And if only the fetus dies, then no harm, no foul according to the pro-abortion ethics, so the car accident should be treated as nothing more than a property loss due to drunk driving. Not that I agree with that belief, but at least it would be consistent with the pro-abortion morality which marginalizes the unborn to the status of non living clumps of cells.\n \n \nThe only ignorance being perpetrated around here is from you and yours ingus.

   "To all the men on here i believe you will make wonderful fathers, your passion for this topic highlights your sincere love of children. But, you may find it hard to find a mother for these children (outside of religious circles) with such belligerent attitudes. I would never let a male tell me i had to breastfeed let alone tell me i had to give birth. \n Would you let someone circumcise you without your consent, or perhaps have someone decide you should have a vasectomy?? No way, we cant even chemically castrate pedophiles so why would you ever be able to make a women give birth.\n I do understand how helpless this situation is for men, especially those who truly want the child. I really hope your never in this situation, but there will never be a law that allows your opinion to dictate a womens actions regarding her body. \n Laws are moving toward pro-choice, not pro-life. In Australia last week the law was reformed to allow legal abortion up to 24 weeks without medical reasoning. (No i dont agree with how late the term extends to) It was a fairly unanimous vote from both the upper and lower house, men and women alike.\n So yes, i can say quiet confidently in my country a man will never have the right to dictate what a women does with her body.",
