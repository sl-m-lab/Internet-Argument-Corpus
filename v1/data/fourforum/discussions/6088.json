   "I heard an interview with John Shadegg today, and this plan made a lot of sense, so thought I would see what you all think of it. Buy low cost insurance from another State provider.\n \n \nNew York requires every insurance policy sold there to cover podiatry. Acupuncture coverage is mandated in 11 states, massage therapy in four, osteopathy in 24, and chiropractors in 47. There are an estimated 1,800 or so such insurance \"mandates\" across the country, and the costs add up. \"It is always the providers asking for the mandate; it is never the consumer,\" says health policy guru John Goodman, who has testified before legislatures considering such rules. \n \n What's more, states like New Jersey and New York add two more ultra-expensive requirements: \"Guaranteed issue\" allows people to wait till they are sick and then buy insurance; \"community rating\" prevents insurers from charging different prices to people of different ages and health status. These may sound like compassionate ideas, until you realize they make insurance so expensive that millions of people are exposed to financial ruin because they aren't allowed to buy basic policies focused on catastrophic costs. \n \n How expensive? A 2004 study by eHealthInsurance.com found that a typical insurance policy ($2,000 deductible, 20% co-insurance) for a family of four could be had for as little in as $172 per month in a reasonably regulated locality like Kansas City, Missouri. But in New York that family's only option -- managed care -- would run $840 per month, and in New Jersey family policies run a whopping $1,200-plus. We bet Democratic Representative Frank Pallone's constituents in New Jersey would be interested in his view that insurance in his state is only \"slightly\" more expensive than elsewhere.\n\n Source",

   "Looks like a great idea to me. Just reading his proposal should help make it clear to just about anyone why health care costs continue to rise. State's meddling isn't the only reason for increased costs, but they seem to be one significant reason. \n \n I don't have much hope for his proposal though. I wonder what his re-election chances will be after insurance companies and health \"providers\" fund his opponent.",

   "This is a serious problem that government caused, not the greedy capitalist pigs they would like us to believe. I can't imagine an insurance company would agree to coverage of a person who found out he had cancer yesterday and applied for insurance today. They had mandates forcing this on them. Anyone who buys insurance has to make up the loss. There has to be another way to solve the problem.",

Shandag's comments show that they both can have common interests (State mandates) that result in wins for both of them and a loss for the general public.",
