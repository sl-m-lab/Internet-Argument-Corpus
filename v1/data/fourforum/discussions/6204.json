   "Now I'm sure after looking at the title you think I'm crazy (and I probably am) but this is really a valid point.\n \n I was watching this sports show, I have no idea what it was, it was just on and they had some guests, Charles Barkley, Al Leiter, and Jon Stewart. Now the host brought up the topic of steroids, and they talked about it a little and then Jon Steward brought something up. Why don't they treat the steroid topic like creationists want the origin of the universe taught. Both sides present their case. A scientist can come in and talk about how steroids can harm your body and give you an edge, then you can bring in a sports player to tell of how it only helps their recovery time, and there is no concrete proof that steroids damages the body. Why don't we do that? The thought that steroids doesn't harm anyone is just as valid as creationism or ID. There is no concrete evidence against it. There's absolutely no evidence for it, and there is plenty of evidence against it, none of which has been disproven. Stewart said it better and it was really funny when he said it, but hey that's why I'm not a commedian.",
