I think if you talk to anybody, it's not choice. I've met people who've struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it. And I've met wives who are supportive of their husbands, or vice versa, when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them. I think we have to respect that. \n \n The President and I share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. I believe that. I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. But I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people,  that you can't discriminate in the workplace, you can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people.

   "\n \n The bill of rights merely recognises pre-existing, natural rights and gives, to some extent, the government the responsibility of protecting those rights.\n\n \n Good citation. However, I have to ask where these natural rights were for the Jews in Nazi Germany? Or the dissidents in Soviet Russia? I will agree that there are certain rights that any government would have to grant in order to be considered a decent government, but history has shown us that being decent is not always a high priority for some governments. \n \n The founders of our country didn't just invent the Constitution from scratch. They were highly educated men, and took the best that the saw from other governments and used it to form our bill of rights. I suppose one could argue that some sort of social evolution would weed out any governement that didn't grant these rights. The dissolution of the Nazis and the Soviets could be cited as an example. That doesn't mean, however, that these rights have some sort of existence outside of a government framework. As your quote says, it \"derives its source from those laws whose authority is acknowledged by civilized man throughout the world.\" The reason we know these rights to be good is not solely because they are in the Constitution, but because these rights have been granted by numerous other governments around the world, down through the ages, and we've seen them to be good.\n \n And by the way, having checked, your quote isn't actually very relevant, is it? The \"it\" refered to was commerce between states, and not any of the rights granted in the bill of rights. Here's the full quote, for the curious:\n \n \"In pursuing this inquiry at the bar, it has been said, that the constitution does not confer the right of intercourse between State and State. That right derives its source from those laws whose authority is acknowledged by civilized man throughout the world. This is true. The constitution found it an existing right, and agve to Congress the power to regulate it. In the exercise of this power, Congress has passed 'an act for enrolling or licensing ships or vessels to be employed in the coasting trade and fisheries, and for regulating the same.'\"\n \n Do you have any quotes from the supreme court that actually deal with human rights, and not commerce?

If the government didn't feel obligated to honor the right to freedom of speech, for example, they could take it from you very easily by locking you in solitary for the rest of your life. You might keep yourself warm at night telling yourself that your \"inalienable\" right hadn't been taken away, but that harsh fact would be that it was. Kerry, apparently, understands this. It's not the inalienabliity of your rights that keeps you safe, it's the fact that those rights are spelled out in the Constitution, and the government feels beholden to follow it. If that weren't the case then you could harp on the inalienability of your rights all you like, but the government would still disenfranchise you, censor you, incarcerate you, do whatever they liked. A right you have no ability to excercise is no right at all.\nLearned men seem to differ with you.\n \n ....",

We all may have been born with these unalienable rights, but our government is responsible for protecting and preserving them from those that would deny us. Take Iraq for instance, Iraqis were born with those same rights, but their government chose to deny them.\n\n \n That is the difference between America and other countries. Our government does not have the option of choosing to deny them, and it was obviously strongly felt by our founding fathers that responsibility for protecting these rights was the governments, but failing that it ultimatly fell to the people to do so. \n \n \nGood citation. However, I have to ask where these natural rights were for the Jews in Nazi Germany? Or the dissidents in Soviet Russia? I will agree that there are certain rights that any government would have to grant in order to be considered a decent government, but history has shown us that being decent is not always a high priority for some governments. \n \n \n They were present, as they are for every person on the planet, some have simply been unsucessful in defending them. This is one thing that really irks me about the US government. Our governemnt long ago decided that the constitution was irrelivent when dealing with foreing policy, which allowed us to do business with evil dictators (Hussein, Noriega, etc....) without causing uncomfortable legal problems at home. to my mind, the bill of rights IS a restriction on our government even when acting abroad. While we cannot run around forcing every nation on the planet to ensure those basic human rights to their population, we certainly should not allow our leaders to support dictators or oppressive goverenments who fail to do so. If we had not been doing this fo rhte last 50 years, the world would be a muych different place, with fewer brutal dictators.\n \n \nThe founders of our country didn't just invent the Constitution from scratch. They were highly educated men, and took the best that the saw from other governments and used it to form our bill of rights. I suppose one could argue that some sort of social evolution would weed out any governement that didn't grant these rights. The dissolution of the Nazis and the Soviets could be cited as an example. That doesn't mean, however, that these rights have some sort of existence outside of a government framework. As your quote says, it \"derives its source from those laws whose authority is acknowledged by civilized man throughout the world.\" The reason we know these rights to be good is not solely because they are in the Constitution, but because these rights have been granted by numerous other governments around the world, down through the ages, and we've seen them to be good.\n\n \n The founders did more than just hodgepodge a government together based on the best they saw in other nations. One of the most radical things they did was introduce the concept of natural rights, and to ensure them right from the getgo. Our nation was founded on the idea of natural rights, and it has been a driving force behind our legal system for many years. This is why many people get upset when these rights are threatened. If you truly love america, how can you possibly suggest that one or more of these natural rights, rights that our people have fought and died defending throughout the years, are invalid?\n \n \nAnd by the way, having checked, your quote isn't actually very relevant, is it? The \"it\" refered to was commerce between states, and not any of the rights granted in the bill of rights. Here's the full quote, for the curious:\n\n \n Actually,m you just managed to find yet another example of the supreme court discussing natural rights, or rights which existed prior to teh writing of the constitution. that isn't where my quote came from.\n \n \nDo you have any quotes from the supreme court that actually deal with human rights, and not commerce? Or, alternatively, can you give the full citation for the Cruikshank case that you quote? I'd really like to see it in full. , and couldn't track it down\n\n \n Again, that quote has nothing to do with commerce. The full case is available at:\n \n http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=92&invol=542\n \n For those who are curious but don't want to see the whole thing, here is the complaint:\n \n \nThe first count was for banding together, with intent 'unlawfully and feloniously to injure, oppress, threaten, and intimidate' two citizens of the United States, 'of African descent and persons of color,' 'with the unlawful and felonious intent thereby' them 'to hinder and prevent in their respective free [92 U.S. 542, 545] exercise and enjoyment of their lawful right and privilege to peaceably assemble together with each other and with other citizens of the said United States for a peaceable and lawful purpose.' \n \n The second avers an intent to hinder and prevent the exercise by the same persons of the 'right to keep and bear arms for a lawful purpose.' \n \n The third avers an intent to deprive the same persons 'of their respective several lives and liberty of person, without due process of law.' \n \n The fourth avers an intent to deprive the same persons of the 'free exercise and enjoyment of the right and privilege to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property' enjoyed by white citizens. \n \n The fifth avers an intent to hinder and prevent the same persons 'in the exercise and enjoyment of the rights, privileges, immunities, and protection granted and secured to them respectively as citizens of the said United States, and as citizens of the said State of Louisiana, by reason of and for and on account of the race and color' of the said persons. \n \n The sixth avers an intent to hinder and prevent the same persons in 'the free exercise and enjoyment of the several and respective right and privilege to vote at any election to be thereafter by law had and held by the people in and of the said State of Louisiana.' \n \n The seventh avers an intent 'to put in great fear of bodily harm, injure, and oppress' the same persons, 'because and for the reason' that, having the right to vote, they had voted. \n \n The eighth avers an intent 'to prevent and hinder' the same persons 'in their several and respective free exercise and enjoyment of every, each, all, and singular and several rights and privileges granted and secured' to them 'by the constitution and laws of the United States.' \n \n The next eight counts are a repetition of the first eight, except that, instead of the words 'band together,' the words 'combine, conspire, and confederate together' are used. Three of the defendants were found guilty under the first sixteen counts, and not guilty under the remaining counts. [92 U.S. 542, 546] The parties thus convicted moved in arrest of judgment on the following grounds:-- \n \n \n It was a civil rights case, and the third time that the supreme court declared that the rights enshrined in the bill of rights were not granted by the governement in the bill of rights but merely recognised there. The two that came before this one did not specifically state that those rights were pre-existing, they both stated merely that they were \"natural rights\" and one court pointed out that the rights within the bill of rights could not be repealed without repealing the entire bill of rights, essentially removing the concept of natural rights from american governemt (think about that real hard before you advocate modifying the bill of rights, you can't just remove one, they all have to go).",
