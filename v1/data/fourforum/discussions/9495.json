   "http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,247458,00.html\n \n And the exact same story at it's source:\n \n http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/01/27/nvirgin27.xml\n \n I found this to be an interesting article. I have two major thoughts about it. One is that it is another good example of how religious groups don't always impose their morality and do bad things as some here portray them as being. This is a case where the religious-based group absolutely put the feelings of this man over their morality, because they knew their call was to help him, not be his moral guide. That's a great example for all Christians, I think, and the way I think Christianity shold aspire to. So I applaud this Christian hospice group. But it also flies in the face of some of Christianity's critics--particularly those who tend to paint it all by it's fundamentalist elements and don't bother to make the distinction (probably on purpose). I imagine this sort of thing must really cause haters of Christianity frustration, since it pretty much goes against generalizations they sometimes make about Christians.\n \n Second, it saddens me to some extent that our culture views raw sex (particularly losing virginity) in such an elevated way that someone would feel it was something they couldn't die without experiencing. I think this touches on so many issues in society these days, and fuels so much of peoples' views. I got the impression that, in the end, it left the young man only longing for a relationship that was truly meaningful rather than solely sexual--he still would have rather had a girlfriend. This truth is so often left out in society's hyper-sexual focus. And I think some of those who oppose abstinence and its proponents could stand to realize that this very issue has a lot to do with why abstinence proponents believe that sex within the context of meaningful committed relationship (marriage) is the right thing to do. It's a monkey wrench in the gears of the hyper-sexual system we live in. So I think this event is a commentary on our society and the expectations it places on people (that they have to lose that virginity at some point, even if with a prostitute).",

   "I think those who oppose abstinence represent a tiny minority.

The truth is that I and many others take a pragmatic attitude - we know that most young people don't share our religious or social views, so we try to mitigate the effects of the poor decisions they make.",

You make it all sound so horrid and sleazy. Your attitude is pretty cold. Having sex one time is hardly \"hypersexual\"; this isolated incident doesn't seem to warrant an indictment of the ills of our permissive society.",

My 2nd comment, which you quote here, is commentary on society, not the guy in hospice or the hospice organization. Nor was it about the guy getting to experience something before he died. Furthermore, if the event was no \"big deal\" then it wouldn't have made the news, now would it? But I never said it WAS a \"big deal\"--those are your words. \n \n \n\"Raw\" sex, indeed. Sounds a little prudish.\n\n \n ??? It was paid-for sex with a prostitute. So yeah, it was raw sex--no love and no relationship there. That's not a value judgement on it, it's simply stating the fact of what it was. Nor did I say anything about anyone being \"hypersexual\" (as you put it).",
