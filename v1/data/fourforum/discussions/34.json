   "Global Warming is not a Threat\n by Jeff Hall\n March 7, 2002\n Global Warming does not threaten the existence of life on earth. For most of earth's history, glaciers did not exist anywhere. The average temperature of the planet was sometimes up to seven to fifteen degrees' Celsius warmer than at the present, and life was still abundant such as during the era of dinosaurs, which lasted for 170 million years. \n \n The average temperature of earth has also been two to three degrees' Celsius warmer at certain times since the last time glaciers retreated from North America ten thousand years ago. One such time was around one thousand years ago when the Vikings established settlements in Greenland, Newfoundland, and Maine. \n \n Regardless of the cause, or causes of global warming, and cooling is that the climate is not static, and normally tends to change over time. Climatic change shouldn't come as a surprise, but instead it should be expected. Small variations are normal and may happen within a human lifetime. Larger changes would probably take longer. Perhaps 1000 years or more, such as when continental glaciers retreated from North America ten to eleven thousand years ago. \n \n As today's climate seems to be warming, it's not a big change so far. It is also not known whether the changes in climate taking place are a long or short-term trend. Thirty years ago some scientists thought that the earth was experiencing a cooling trend, and now it is seen to be warming. Whatever changes that do take place all life has to cope with it the best they can. Some species may not be able to adapt and become extinct. Others might do very well and flourish due to advantageous conditions created by the change in climate. \n \n People also have to cope with climate change, and they should be able to afford the ability to adjust to it. For that to happen, government needs to stay out of their way and treat people like responsible adults. Letting the populace become dependant on government for its needs renders them helpless in tough situations, because they will not know what to do if one occurs. \n \n In order for people to successfully adjust to climate changes that adversely affect their livelihoods, government needs to drastically cut taxes in order to allow the average man make the necessary changes on his own. Government is very poor at managing people's lives, and should have nothing to do with any attempts to preside over how people live. People are much better at helping each other when in need than socialist governments where everyone works for the common good of society. Collective forms of government where everyone has all of their eggs in one basket don't work because it denies individual freedom. Therefore, innovation, creativity, and a desire to excel are quelled. \n \n The truth is that the global warming issue is being used by disgruntled socialists/communists masquerading as environmentalists to take full control of the U.S. government, and implement their marxist agenda upon all, while naive liberals gleefully fall in line. Leftists blame capitalism for society's problems, and see the U.S. as the chief culprit. Global Warming is just one way of achieving their goal by scaring people into submission that global warming is a threat to civilization, and life. It's not. Life will continue, and if the climate warmed enough to shorten winter by two months from Maine to Montana, a lot people would welcome it because the winters in the northern tier of the United States can last from November to April with temperatures as cold as -30OF and colder. \n \n The winter of 2001/2002 has been unusually warm, but it still is not that big of a change when compared to changes that have happened before. There could be a cool summer ahead, and no one knows for sure what the climate on earth will be 10, or 100 years from now. Even forecasting weather more than a week or two in advance is the limit in predicting what the weather is on each given day. It's not that the meteorologist doesn't \"know anything\" if he forecasts the wrong weather only a day or two in advance. It's because weather is very difficult to predict due to its chaotic patterns. When it comes to predicting climate that is more difficult still, and no successful forecast has been made yet.",
