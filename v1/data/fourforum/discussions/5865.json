She invents new legal principles just as much as any \"activist judge\" on the liberal side, e.g. in Lungren where her decision was based on \"societal values\" that do not appear anywhere in the constitution or supporting documents. She makes stuff up, all right - it's just stuff that is more appealing to a certain constituency so it's apparently OK. I actually think it's good that we're talking about her, because it helps to reveal how the right's use of phrases like \"strict construction\" has absolutely nothing to do with any kind of coherent or consistently applied principle. They'll abandon principle in a heartbeat if it gets them a judge who agrees with the way they want to rewrite the constitution.",

What will the republicans do then that they shot themselves in the foot?\n \n \n BTW VOR why do you hate people so much that you are against programs to help the most needy in society?\n Have you ever been homeless? Let me tell you it sucks. Thats what you conservatives don't understand is that your decisions effect real people not just faceless numbers.\n \n About the supreme court nomination what you also fail to realise is that if ROE V WADE goes down cross the border abortion clinics will spring up in Canada. In Michigan where I live certain kinds of fireworks are illegal, but not in Indiana. Guess what is right across the border? A fireworks stand selling the very same fireworks that are illegal in Michigan. I can tell you now that Windsor is only a 1 1/2 hour drive from where I live. As well as many Canadian cities are well within a couple hours drive from many parts of the upper USA. Have you ever thought though that there are still ways for women to get abortions.",
