   "FORT HOOD, Texas - A soldier opened fire at a U.S. Army base in Fort Hood, Texas on Thursday, unleashing a stream of gunfire that left 12 people dead and 31 wounded. Authorities killed the gunman, and apprehended two other soldiers suspected in what appears to be the worst mass shooting at a U.S. military base.\n \n The shooting began around 1:30 p.m., Lt. Gen. Bob Cone said at a news conference. He said all the casualties took place at the base's Soldier Readiness Center, where soldiers who are about to be deployed or who are returning undergo medical screening.\n \n \"It's a terrible tragedy. It's stunning,\" Cone said.\n \n A law enforcement official identified the shooting suspect as Army Maj. Malik Nadal Hasan. The official said Hasan, believed to be in his late 30s, was killed after opening fire at the base. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case publicly.\n \n The official says investigators are trying to determine if Hasan was his birth name, or if he changed his name and converted to Islam at some point in his life.\n \n Cone said the soldier used two handguns in the attack. It was not clear if the gunman had stopped to reload.\n \n A graduation ceremony for soldiers who finished college courses while deployed was going on in an auditorium at the Readiness Center at the time of the shooting, said Sgt. Rebekah Lampam, a Fort Hood spokeswoman.\n \n Army: 12 die in dual shootings at Fort Hood, Texas - Yahoo! News",

   "12 dead, 31 wounded in Fort Hood shooting\n Slain suspect at Texas base reportedly identified as Maj. Malik Nadal Hasan\n \u00a9 2009 WorldNetDaily\n An Army soldier opened fire at Fort Hood in Texas, killing 11 soldiers and wounding 31, before he was killed by a local police officer. \n \n The Army identified the suspected gunman as Maj. Malik Nadal Hasan. A local radio reporter said Hasan is a Muslim convert.\n \n Retired Maj. Gen. Robert Scales told Fox News the massacre did not appear to be the act of a mentally ill or extremely stressed person. \n \n \"This was a deliberate act of execution,\" he said. \n \n The shooter was immediately killed, according to Lt. Gen. Bob Cone, a base spokesman, and two additional suspects, also soldiers, have been apprehended.\n \n One incident, at about 1:30 p.m. Central Time, took place at a medical processing center, a second took place at a theater on the base, Lt Col Nathan Banks at the Pentagon told the Associated Press. \n \n The base, about 60 miles from Austin, and two area school districts are on lockdown. \n \n Greg Schannep, an aide to U.S. Rep. John Carter, said he was on the Army post to attend a graduation service, the Austin American-Statesman newspaper reported. As he neared the entrance of a building where the service was being held, he said, a soldier with blood on his uniform ran past him and said a man was shooting. \n \n Schannep told the paper the shootings appeared to have occurred in a complex near the theater where the service was scheduled. \n \n CNN reported President Obama has been advised of the shooting. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the president is being kept updated. CNN said staffers have gathered in the situation room, possibly as a precautionary measure since details are still emerging. \n \n The FBI reportedly was en route. \n \n Sgt. Major Jamie Posten of the Fort Hood public affairs office said shooting took place \"near the soldier readiness processing center, where soldiers cycle through as they prepare to deploy.\" \n \n Posten said soldiers go to the center up to 60 days before deployment to begin the process of vaccinations and other preparation. \n \n \"It's still developing. We're trying to figure out what took place on the ground,\" he said. \n \n Fort Hood, home to at least 4,929 active duty officers and 45,414 enlisted, is the largest U.S. military complex in the world. Another 9,000 civilians work on the base. \n \n More to come ...\n \n 12 dead, 31 wounded in Fort Hood shooting",

   "Tragic events can bring out the best in people. They can also serve as a catalyst to bring out the worst in people-those whose only care or contact with a tragic event is to calculate how it can be adopted and spun to fit their social agenda. Simone was a good example of this behavior when the Va Tech shooting happened. This Fort Hood tragedy is proving no different. Islamaphobes are already pointing out the suspected shooter's alleged religious faith and are trying to spin this tragedy to into a weapon to attack Islam. Hoplophobes are already rushing in to adopt this tragedy and spin it into an indictment of firearms. I guess they have adopted the motto that says \"never let a good crisis go to waste.\" \n \n Come on, everyone. Have we really so little humanity and compassion that we are unable to set aside our differences for even a moment, or must everything in life be seized upon and weighed in the selfish balance of \"how much does this help or hurt my political blogging agenda\"? \n \n Now is the time to pause and mourn what has happened-to await the answers law enforcement can bring us for how and why this event happened-and to start building a solid information base about this event so we can have a rational discussion of this tragedy.\n \n I know there are some people who are not capable of this. They are already showing up here. But I would be ashamed to be thought of as one of them. You want to blame the gun for the hand that wielded it? Fine. We can have that debate-after we know all the facts. \n \n Look. I am a realist. I know that not everyone feels this way.

So I say to them go head-elbow the mourners aside and charge on in with microphone, pen, or keyboard at the ready. I won't stand in your way to be trampled in your rush to blame the things you already fear-and for which you have been impatiently waiting to take advantage of another tragedy to blame them for.

Along with the rest of the country, we wish the Fort Hood community a return to a secure and safe environment.\n \n \"When I heard of the tragedy yesterday, we were in the midst of planning a response to the latest dangerous legislative proposal from the gun lobby in the United States Senate - language to automatically restore access to guns to veterans designated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Justice Department as 'mentally incapacitated' or 'mentally incompetent.' In light of what happened yesterday - a violent attack by an emotionally unstable soldier - it is even clearer that the proposal being pushed by Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina should be rejected.\n \n \"America has seen an epidemic of horrific gun violence at churches and synagogues, workplaces, health clubs, high schools, universities, police stations and now Army bases.

   "\"Between the convulsive emotional response to a single murder and an elusive general theory of murder lies another kind of contemplation: the study of the murderousness of nations. The United States has the highest homicide rate of any affluent democracy, nearly four times that of France and the United Kingdom, and six times that of Germany. Why? Historians haven't often asked this question. Even historians who like to try to solve cold cases usually cede to sociologists and other social scientists the study of what makes murder rates rise and fall, or what might account for why one country is more murderous than another. Only in the nineteen-seventies did historians begin studying homicide in any systematic way. In the United States, that effort was led by Eric Monkkonen, who died in 2005, his promising work unfinished. Monkkonen's research has been taken up by Randolph Roth, whose book \"American Homicide\" (Harvard; $45) offers a vast investigation of murder, in the aggregate, and over time. Roth's argument is profoundly unsettling. There is and always has been, he claims, an American way of murder. It is the price of our politics.... \" \n \n \n Murder in America : The New Yorker",

   "Besides the Yang Mr. Smith is trying to throw, there is the truth. You know. Actual causes of crime and murder! \n \n 17 April 2002 article.\n \n   Physiology, sociology and murder: a scientist looks at violence in America \n Only about 6 percent of the population causes about 70 percent of violent crime, according to current statistics. Pincus's medical colleagues routinely label such people \"sociopaths\" or having \"antisocial personality disorder.\" But Pincus believes that such descriptions are useless tautologies that do not explain why someone would commit an antisocial act. Diagnostic labels and understanding the issue are very different.\n \n Pincus and his colleague Dr. Dorothy Lewis, a child psychiatrist, developed the view that murderers, and especially the most notorious kind, such as serial killers, are the product of the combination of child abuse with neurological damage and psychiatric illness. The three factors interact, as childhood abuse creates enormous anger, while neurologic and psychiatric diseases of the brain damage the capacity to stop urges to violence. A supplementary disinhibiting factor is the abuse of alcohol and drugs, involved in an estimated 70 percent of violent crimes.\n \n Their theory does not at all suppose a mechanical or automatic correlation between any of these conditions separately and violent behavior. As Pincus emphasizes repeatedly, most people who suffer from brain damage do not exhibit violent behavior. Nor do most people who suffer from mental illness or who were abused as children. It is the combination of all three factors that correlates very highly with violent behavior.\n \n It is widely accepted that child abuse has terrible psychological consequences for the victims both as children and as adults. What is still being researched is how the abuse affects the working and even the physical structure of the brain, altering its developmental anatomy, physiology and functioning.\n \n ....\n What emerges from the study is an overall picture of families and society in disintegration. Some of the figures show the relationship between abuse and the deteriorating social and economic circumstances confronting the vast majority of Americans, and affecting with special force the most vulnerable in society, children. The frequency of physical abuse, sexual abuse and neglect doubled between 1986 and 1993. Child abuse is the fourth leading cause of death for all children aged one to four in the US and the second leading cause for African-American children in that age bracket. It is also much more common for both whites and blacks in the Southern states. Children from families with incomes of less than $15,000 per year suffered more than twice the rate of physical abuse as children in families with incomes of $15,000 to $30,000. Population studies show that poverty, large families, single-parent families and illicit drug use are all associated with the likelihood of child abuse.\n\n \n   From the USDOJ Violent Felons in Large Urban Counties July 2006, NCJ 205289 \n\n * Seventy percent of violent felons had a prior arrest \n record, and 57% had at least one prior arrest for a \n felony. Sixty-seven percent of murderers and 73% of \n those convicted of robbery or assault had an arrest \n record.\n \n A BJS analysis of felony convictions in \n the 75 most populous counties found that a majority \n of those committing violent felonies had--\n * multiple prior arrests\n * at least 1 prior felony arrest\n * at least 1 prior conviction.\n \n .... Half of convicted murderers were younger than 25; \n .... Blacks (46%) comprised a higher \n percentage of murderers than Hispanics (27%) or \n whites (23%).\n \n ... Prior arrests\n \n An estimated 70% of violent felons in the 75 \n largest counties had been arrested previously. \n Seventy-three percent of those convicted of robbery \n or assault had an arrest record, as did 67% of \n murderers, and 53% of rapists. \n\n \n   Murder in Families \n Seventy-four percent of murder defendants had a prior criminal record of arrest\n\n Yes the report is about murder in families but the above quoted is talking about murder in general. The study then goes on to explore murder and their victims in families. \n   Murder in Families \n ... 77% of other murder defendants, had a prior record.\n\n All of this agrees with the University of Tennessee Med school study done in 1991.\n  Study done by the University of Tennessee Med school \nLooking only to official criminal records, data over the past thirty years consistently show that the mythology of murderers as ordinary citizens does not hold true. Studies have found that approximately 75% of murderers have adult criminal records, and that murderers average a prior adult criminal career of six years, including four major adult felony arrests. These studies also found that when the murder occurred [a]bout 11% of murder arrestees [were] actually on pre-trial release--that is, they were awaiting trial for another offense. \n \n The fact that only 75% of murderers have adult crime records should not be misunderstood as implying that the remaining 25% of murderers are non-criminals. The reason over half of those 25% of murderers don't have adult records is that they are juveniles. Thus, by definition they cannot have an adult criminal record. Juvenile criminal records might well show these murderers to have extensive serious criminal records. \n\n The above data also agrees with this 2001 article and the number of violent crime statistics shown here.\n Gun Violence and Constitutional Issues \n The FBI statistics reveal that 75 percent of all violent crimes for any locality are committed by six percent of hardened criminals and repeat offenders.18 Violent crimes continue to be a problem in the inner cities with gangs involved in the drug trade.\n",

   "The United States has the highest homicide rate of any affluent democracy, nearly four times that of France and the United Kingdom, and six times that of Germany. Why? Historians haven't often asked this question. Even historians who like to try to solve cold cases usually cede to sociologists and other social scientists the study of what makes murder rates rise and fall, or what might account for why one country is more murderous than another. Only in the nineteen-seventies did historians begin studying homicide in any systematic way. In the United States, that effort was led by Eric Monkkonen, who died in 2005, his promising work unfinished. Monkkonen's research has been taken up by Randolph Roth, whose book \"American Homicide\" (Harvard; $45) offers a vast investigation of murder, in the aggregate, and over time. Roth's argument is profoundly unsettling. There is and always has been, he claims, an American way of murder. It is the price of our politics....\n \n In Europe, homicide rates, conventionally represented as the number of murder victims per hundred thousand people in the population per year, have been falling for centuries......\n \n \n In the United States, the picture could hardly be more different. The American homicide rate has been higher than Europe's from the start, and higher at just about every stage since. It has also fluctuated, sometimes wildly. During the Colonial period, the homicide rate fell, but in the nineteenth century, while Europe's kept sinking, the U.S. rate went up and up. In the twentieth century, the rate in the United States dropped to about five during the years following the Second World War, but then rose, reaching about eleven in 1991. It has since fallen once again, to just above five, a rate that is, nevertheless, twice that of any other affluent democracy.\n \n What accounts for this remarkable difference? Guns leap to mind: in 2008, firearms were involved in two-thirds of all murders in the United States. Yet Roth, who supports gun control, insists that the prevalence of guns in America, and our lax gun laws, can't account for the whole spread, and a few scholars have argued that laws allowing concealed weapons actually lower the murder rate, by deterring assaults. Some Europeans suspect that Americans haven't undergone the same \"civilizing process,\" as if, unmoored from Europe, Colonial Americans went murderously adrift. Spierenburg speculates that democracy came too soon to the United States. By the time European states became democracies, the populace had accepted the authority of the state. But the American Revolution happened before Americans had got used to the idea of a state monopoly on force.

It has been described as a \"proactive\" response to the 17 per cent increase in gun crime over the past six months.\n\n \n Or this:\n \n http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1034621/Revealed-The-truth-knife-crime--soared-35-cent-parts-Britain.html\n \n \nThe full scale of Britain&#8217;s growing knife crime menace is today exposed by The Mail on Sunday.\n \n Our new figures show that almost every major city is facing soaring levels of stabbings and knifepoint muggings &#8211; casting doubt on Home Secretary Jacqui Smith&#8217;s reassurances about the safety of our streets.\n\n \n Or this:\n \n http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-381799/Let-burglars-caution-police-told.html\n \n \nBurglars will be allowed to escape without punishment under new instructions sent to all police forces. Police have been told they can let them off the threat of a court appearance and instead allow them to go with a caution.\n \n The same leniency will be shown to criminals responsible for more than 60 other different offences, ranging from arson through vandalism to sex with underage girls.\n \n New rules sent to police chiefs by the Home Office set out how seriously various crimes should be regarded, and when offenders who admit to them should be sent home with a caution.\n \n A caution counts as a criminal record but means the offender does not face a court appearance which would be likely to end in a fine, a community punishment or jail.\n \n Some serious offences - including burglary of a shop or office, threatening to kill, actual bodily harm, and possession of Class A drugs such as heroin or cocaine - may now be dealt with by caution if police decide that would be the best approach.\n \n And a string of crimes including common assault, threatening behaviour, sex with an underage girl or boy, and taking a car without its owner's consent, should normally be dealt with by a caution, the circular said.\n",

   "The United States has the highest homicide rate of any affluent democracy, nearly four times that of France and the United Kingdom, and six times that of Germany. Why? Historians haven&#8217;t often asked this question. Even historians who like to try to solve cold cases usually cede to sociologists and other social scientists the study of what makes murder rates rise and fall, or what might account for why one country is more murderous than another. Only in the nineteen-seventies did historians begin studying homicide in any systematic way. In the United States, that effort was led by Eric Monkkonen, who died in 2005, his promising work unfinished. Monkkonen&#8217;s research has been taken up by Randolph Roth, whose book &#8220;American Homicide&#8221; (Harvard; $45) offers a vast investigation of murder, in the aggregate, and over time. Roth&#8217;s argument is profoundly unsettling. There is and always has been, he claims, an American way of murder. It is the price of our politics....\n \n In Europe, homicide rates, conventionally represented as the number of murder victims per hundred thousand people in the population per year, have been falling for centuries......\n \n \n In the United States, the picture could hardly be more different. The American homicide rate has been higher than Europe&#8217;s from the start, and higher at just about every stage since. It has also fluctuated, sometimes wildly. During the Colonial period, the homicide rate fell, but in the nineteenth century, while Europe&#8217;s kept sinking, the U.S. rate went up and up. In the twentieth century, the rate in the United States dropped to about five during the years following the Second World War, but then rose, reaching about eleven in 1991. It has since fallen once again, to just above five, a rate that is, nevertheless, twice that of any other affluent democracy.\n What accounts for this remarkable difference? Guns leap to mind: in 2008, firearms were involved in two-thirds of all murders in the United States. Yet Roth, who supports gun control, insists that the prevalence of guns in America, and our lax gun laws, can&#8217;t account for the whole spread, and a few scholars have argued that laws allowing concealed weapons actually lower the murder rate, by deterring assaults. Some Europeans suspect that Americans haven&#8217;t undergone the same &#8220;civilizing process,&#8221; as if, unmoored from Europe, Colonial Americans went murderously adrift. Spierenburg speculates that democracy came too soon to the United States. By the time European states became democracies, the populace had accepted the authority of the state.

   "Let soldiers pack heat on post\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Posted: November 10, 2009\n 1:00 am Eastern\n \n \n By Gerard Valentino\n \u00a9 2009 \n \n As a veteran of the U.S. Army, I was brought to tears by the horrific massacre at Fort Hood, Texas. Seeing coverage of my former comrades brutally murdered at my former duty station was almost too much to take. The news that it was allegedly the act of a fellow soldier remains unfathomable. \n \n While stationed there a few years back, we knew were sitting ducks for a terrorist attack and that only the appearance of security kept it from happening. Anyone on the inside, like the alleged gunman in this case, knew he could easily pull off such a massacre. \n \n The military rightly protects stealth bombers and intelligence assets so a successful attack at such a post is highly unlikely. They keep the number of personnel at such facilities lower so tighter security measures can be used without disrupting day to day life. Admitting that publicly at this point isn't giving terrorists a helpful tip - the massacre at Fort Hood gave them a great road map for similar attacks in the future. \n \n What most people don't realize is the huge difference in how individual posts handle security and access to the post itself. To be fair, in most cases it isn't a failing of the administration but instead simple logistics that create an opening for an attack similar to what happened at Fort Hood. The huge number of soldiers and civilians that work on post make it impossible to check every ID and every car. \n \n Looking at the Fort Hood attack in more general terms exposes that it followed the same pattern as nearly every killing spree in America, with the exception of the fact that it occurred on a military installation. \n \n First on the list of similarities is that the victims were in a place where legal concealed carry is prohibited. The soldiers were disarmed in the same manner as the students at Columbine, or the students at Virginia Tech. The sad fact is that regardless of whether you go to a victim zone in a military uniform or dressed in ill-fitting clothes of the average college student, you are at an undue risk because the criminal will be the only one with a gun when the shooting starts. \n \n Other similarities include that in nearly every other attack it took a good guy, or girl, with a gun to stop the alleged gunman, and that in nearly all workplace massacres, the murderer knew his victims were unarmed and therefore easy targets. \n \n Had the two police officers credited with stopping the rampage not arrived in such short order there is no telling how many more heroic Americans could have had their lives snuffed out on the killing fields at Fort Hood. \n \n The media coverage follows the same pattern in nearly every killing spree as well. As usual, a lot of time is being spent on covering why the alleged gunman chose to kill co-workers. \n \n To be honest, I don't think that issue should shape the debate once the full investigation is complete. Despite the evolution of mental health readiness in America, predicting who might go on a murderous rampage is very difficult. For every person that fits the pattern of a spree killer and acts on his or her rage, there are thousands who are simply lost souls in need of help, but are not a threat to anyone. \n \n The real question is why soldiers trained to carry a gun in combat are disarmed while going about their daily business when they are one of the prime targets of terrorism. While nobody wants fully armed soldiers marching down Main Street, USA, allowing them the same right to carry civilians are afforded is morally and legally just. \n \n Leaving any American without a means of self-defense while a spree killer plies his trade is simply wrong, whether the victim is a civilian or soldier. \n \n In states where legal concealed carry is an accepted practice, American service members need to be allowed to carry a gun for self-defense - on post and off - because the global war on terror has changed the risk level they live with each and every day. \n \n The global war on terror has changed the way America fights our wars and has changed the risk level our service members are forced to endure. Letting soldiers have the same rights afforded to civilians when it comes to carrying a concealed handgun is a reform that is well past due. \n \n Reforms to labor laws to allow employees to carry guns for self-defense at work or that force employers to truly care for worker safety are needed in America today so that the next active shooter in a workplace, whether military or civilian, is met with incoming live rounds instead of screaming and cowering workers. \n \n Let soldiers pack heat on post",

Hood was designated a \"gun free zone\"?\n \n Yet he wound up shot.\n\n \n Let soldiers pack heat on post\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Posted: November 10, 2009\n 1:00 am Eastern\n \n \n By Gerard Valentino\n \u00a9 2009 \n \n As a veteran of the U.S. Army, I was brought to tears by the horrific massacre at Fort Hood, Texas. Seeing coverage of my former comrades brutally murdered at my former duty station was almost too much to take. The news that it was allegedly the act of a fellow soldier remains unfathomable. \n \n While stationed there a few years back, we knew were sitting ducks for a terrorist attack and that only the appearance of security kept it from happening. Anyone on the inside, like the alleged gunman in this case, knew he could easily pull off such a massacre. \n \n The military rightly protects stealth bombers and intelligence assets so a successful attack at such a post is highly unlikely. They keep the number of personnel at such facilities lower so tighter security measures can be used without disrupting day to day life. Admitting that publicly at this point isn't giving terrorists a helpful tip - the massacre at Fort Hood gave them a great road map for similar attacks in the future. \n \n What most people don't realize is the huge difference in how individual posts handle security and access to the post itself. To be fair, in most cases it isn't a failing of the administration but instead simple logistics that create an opening for an attack similar to what happened at Fort Hood. The huge number of soldiers and civilians that work on post make it impossible to check every ID and every car. \n \n Looking at the Fort Hood attack in more general terms exposes that it followed the same pattern as nearly every killing spree in America, with the exception of the fact that it occurred on a military installation. \n \n First on the list of similarities is that the victims were in a place where legal concealed carry is prohibited. The soldiers were disarmed in the same manner as the students at Columbine, or the students at Virginia Tech. The sad fact is that regardless of whether you go to a victim zone in a military uniform or dressed in ill-fitting clothes of the average college student, you are at an undue risk because the criminal will be the only one with a gun when the shooting starts. \n \n Other similarities include that in nearly every other attack it took a good guy, or girl, with a gun to stop the alleged gunman, and that in nearly all workplace massacres, the murderer knew his victims were unarmed and therefore easy targets. \n \n Had the two police officers credited with stopping the rampage not arrived in such short order there is no telling how many more heroic Americans could have had their lives snuffed out on the killing fields at Fort Hood. \n \n The media coverage follows the same pattern in nearly every killing spree as well. As usual, a lot of time is being spent on covering why the alleged gunman chose to kill co-workers. \n \n To be honest, I don't think that issue should shape the debate once the full investigation is complete. Despite the evolution of mental health readiness in America, predicting who might go on a murderous rampage is very difficult. For every person that fits the pattern of a spree killer and acts on his or her rage, there are thousands who are simply lost souls in need of help, but are not a threat to anyone. \n \n The real question is why soldiers trained to carry a gun in combat are disarmed while going about their daily business when they are one of the prime targets of terrorism. While nobody wants fully armed soldiers marching down Main Street, USA, allowing them the same right to carry civilians are afforded is morally and legally just. \n \n Leaving any American without a means of self-defense while a spree killer plies his trade is simply wrong, whether the victim is a civilian or soldier. \n \n In states where legal concealed carry is an accepted practice, American service members need to be allowed to carry a gun for self-defense - on post and off - because the global war on terror has changed the risk level they live with each and every day. \n \n The global war on terror has changed the way America fights our wars and has changed the risk level our service members are forced to endure. Letting soldiers have the same rights afforded to civilians when it comes to carrying a concealed handgun is a reform that is well past due. \n \n Reforms to labor laws to allow employees to carry guns for self-defense at work or that force employers to truly care for worker safety are needed in America today so that the next active shooter in a workplace, whether military or civilian, is met with incoming live rounds instead of screaming and cowering workers. \n \n Let soldiers pack heat on post\n Did you miss that post?

   "Let's start at the beginning.\n Let us imagine a nice little town where there are no guns.\n OK there are stabbings sometimes, brawls of course just like in any nice little town, but of course no cases of one crazy loony going on killing rampage using a knife and people waiting in line while the knife wielding killer finishes carving up person after person after person\n \n One day, strangers come to town introducing guns into the system, soon the guns are used in robberies, domestic murders etc until one day some loony decides to take it out on fellow employees after being fired (pardon the pun) by going back to his old place employment, packing his favourite personal defensive weapon: a Madsen machine gun that fires 500 rounds per minute, by the time security guards react it is too late. He kills a dozen or so of his formers co-workers and then shoots himself dead.\n \n Horrified, the people of the town ban all guns even fake guns, normality resumes.\n This is what happened in Australia after the killing spree in Tasmania.\n \n Similar laws have been enacted in the rest of the world outside Asylum America, where instead the answer to mass killings, murders etc, given by the loon brigade is to supply guns to every man, woman, child and toddler to defend themselves from every gun packing man, woman, child and toddler.\n \n Even the guy who proposed that all servicemen pack guns at all time said :\n \n \n \n So in the USA we have the situation where the gun crazies want that everybody be armed to the teeth to protect themselves of everybody equally armed to the teeth, for no one knows who is a spree killer and who is a 'lost soul'. The price of paranoia is constant vigilance.\n \n Question:\n \n where there is a higher risk of a being shot ?\n \n a) in a place where there are no guns or \n \n b) in a place where everybody packs a gun?\n \n I know it is a hard question hm... let me see how the was question again ? \n \n I think the problem in America is two fold : not only guns are readily available but the American character is violent, barbaric, murderous, uncivilized. The 'there is nothing that a gun can't fix' mentality is reflected in the warmongering they are infamous for such as these examples: their civil war, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan and who knows maybe one day they will also attack Iran.\n And let us not forget the powerful gun manufactures and dealers lobby. \n \n BTW who replaced Charlton Heston as the figure head for the gun lobby?\n Was he buried with his favourite guns or were they taken away from his dead body?\n\n \n Congrats winnie the poo you have replaced pinhead at the top of the comic relief list. You might ask your silly question of the late mayor of Hiroshima but then he's dead by gunfire in your wet dream of a gun free nation. You forgot the WWI &WWII but then you'd be speaking Japanese to your master if we weren't so efficient at war. Silly liberal thinks its a wit. Only half right tho!",

Beginning in March 1993, under the Clinton administration, the army forbids military personnel from carrying their own personal firearms and mandates that \"a credible and specific threat against [Department of the Army] personnel [exist] in that region\" before military personnel \"may be authorized to carry firearms for personal protection.\" Indeed, most military bases have relatively few military police as they are in heavy demand to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n \n The unarmed soldiers could do little more than cower as Major Nidal Malik Hasan stood on a desk and shot down into the cubicles in which his victims were trapped. Some behaved heroically, such as private first class Marquest Smith who repeatedly risked his life removing five soldiers and a civilian from the carnage. But, being unarmed, these soldiers were unable to stop Hasan's attack.\n \n The wife of one of the soldiers shot at Ft. Hood understood this all too well. Mandy Foster's husband had been shot but was fortunate enough not to be seriously injured. In an interview on CNN on Monday night, Mrs. Foster was asked by anchor John Roberts how she felt about her husband \"still scheduled for deployment in January\" to Afghanistan. Ms. Foster responded: \"At least he's safe there and he can fire back, right?\" -- It is hard to believe that we don't trust soldiers with guns on an army base when we trust these very same men in Iraq and Afghanistan. Unfortunately, most of CNN's listeners probably didn't understand the rules that Ms. Foster was referring to.\n \n The law-abiding, not the criminals, are the ones who obey the ban on guns. Instead of making areas safe for victims, the bans make it safe for the criminal. Hasan not only violated the army's ban on carrying a gun, he also apparently violated the rules that require soldiers to register privately owned guns at the post.\n \n Research shows that allowing individuals to defend themselves dramatically reduces the rates of multiple victim public shootings. Even if attacks still occur, having civilians with permitted concealed handguns limits the damage. A major factor in determining how many people are harmed by these killers is the amount of time that elapses between when the attack starts and someone is able to arrive on the scene with a gun. Ten minutes must have seemed like an eternity to those trapped in the attack at Ft. Hood. All the multiple victim public shootings in the U.S. -- in which more than three people have been killed -- have all occurred in places where concealed handguns have been banned.\n \n For several days now, some in the media and various gun control groups have focused on a so-called \"cop killer\" gun that Hasan used. The five-seven is a conventional semi-automatic pistol. In fact, the bullets that it fires are relatively small, only being in the .22 caliber class. Unlike rifles, even higher caliber handguns don't fire publicly available ammunition at sufficient velocity to penetrate a police officer's vest. There is a special type of handgun ammunition that can penetrate some types of body armor, but under federal law it is not legal to manufacture or import that ammunition for sale to the public.\n \n For the safety of our soldiers and citizens, we hope that this simple fact about the Ft. Hood attack and the role that gun-free zones played in allowing yet another multiple victim public shooting becomes part of the news coverage itself. The political debate about guns would be quite different if even once in a while a news story clearly explained that there has been another multiple victim public shooting in a gun-free zone.\n",

   "EDITORIAL: End Clinton-era military base gun ban - Washington Times\n \n \nTime after time, public murder sprees occur in \"gun-free zones\" - public places where citizens are not legally able to carry guns. The list is long, including massacres at Virginia Tech and Columbine High School along with many less deadly attacks. Last week's slaughter at Fort Hood Army base in Texas was no different - except that one man bears responsibility for the ugly reality that the men and women charged with defending America were deliberately left defenseless when a terrorist opened fire.\n \n Among President Clinton's first acts upon taking office in 1993 was to disarm U.S. soldiers on military bases. In March 1993, the Army imposed regulations forbidding military personnel from carrying their personal firearms and making it almost impossible for commanders to issue firearms to soldiers in the U.S. for personal protection. For the most part, only military police regularly carry firearms on base, and their presence is stretched thin by high demand for MPs in war zones.\n \n Because of Mr. Clinton, terrorists would face more return fire if they attacked a Texas Wal-Mart than the gunman faced at Fort Hood, home of the heavily armed and feared 1st Cavalry Division. That's why a civilian policewoman from off base was the one whose marksmanship ended Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan's rampage.\n \n Everyone wants to keep people safe - and no one denies Mr. Clinton's good intentions. The problem is that law-abiding good citizens, not criminals, are the ones who obey those laws. Bans end up disarming potential victims and not criminals. Rather than making places safe for victims, we unintentionally make them safe for the criminal - or in this case, the terrorist.\n \n The wife of one of the soldiers shot at Fort Hood understands all too well. In an interview on CNN Monday night, Anchor John Roberts asked Mandy Foster how she felt about her husband's upcoming deployment to Afghanistan. Ms. Foster responded: \"At least he's safe there and he can fire back, right?\"\n \n It is hard to believe that we don't trust soldiers with guns on an Army base when we trust these very same men in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr. Clinton's deadly rules even disarmed officers, the most trusted members of the military charged with leading enlisted soldiers in combat. Six of the dead and wounded had commissions.\n \n Most people understand that guns deter criminals. Research also shows that the presence of more guns limits the damage mass murderers can unleash. A major factor in determining how many people are harmed by these killers is the time that elapses between the launch of an attack and when someone - soldier, civilian or law enforcement - arrives on the scene with a gun to end the attack. All the public shootings in the United States in which more than three people have been killed have occurred in places where concealed handguns have been banned.\n \n Thirteen dead bodies in a Texas morgue are the ultimate fruit of gun-control illogic - in which guns are so feared that government regulation even tries to keep them out of the hands of trained soldiers. With the stroke of a pen, President Obama can end Mr. Clinton's folly and allow U.S. soldiers to protect themselves. Because we clearly cannot protect our soldiers from harm, the least we owe them is the right to protect themselves.\n",

   "Surprise! Disarming victims ends badly :: CHICAGO SUN-TIMES :: Other Views\n \n \nWhen Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan started shooting up the Soldier Readiness Processing Center at Fort Hood, Pfc. Marquest Smith dove under a desk. The Associated Press reported that \"he lay low for several minutes, waiting for the shooter to run out of ammunition and wishing he, too, had a gun.\"\n \n Neither Smith nor the other victims of Hasan's assault had guns because soldiers on military bases within the United States generally are not allowed to carry them. Last week's shootings, which killed 13 people and wounded more than 30, demonstrated once again the folly of \"gun-free zones,\" which attract and assist people bent on mass murder instead of deterring them.\n \n Judging from the comments of those who support this policy of victim disarmament, Smith's desire for a gun was irrational. According to Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, \"This latest tragedy, at a heavily fortified Army base, ought to convince more Americans to reject the argument that the solution to gun violence is to arm more people with more guns in more places.\"\n \n Note how the reference to \"a heavily fortified Army base\" obscures the crucial point that the people attacked by Hasan were unarmed as a matter of policy. Also note the breathtaking inanity of Helmke's assurance that \"more guns\" are not \"the solution to gun violence.\" In this case, they assuredly were.\n \n The first people with guns to confront Hasan, two local police officers, were the ones who put a stop to his rampage. And while Sgt. Kim Munley and Sgt. Mark Todd acted heroically, they did not arrive on the scene until a crucial 10 minutes or so had elapsed and Hasan had fired more than 100 rounds.\n \n If someone else at the processing center had had a gun when Hasan started shooting, it seems likely that fewer people would have been killed or injured. Furthermore, the knowledge that some of his victims would be armed might have led him to choose a different, softer target in order to maximize the impact of his attack.\n \n There would have been plenty of targets to choose from: any of the locations in Texas, including schools and shopping malls, that advertise their prohibition of gun possession. The problem is that crazed killers tend not to follow such rules.\n \n That problem was vividly illustrated by the second deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, which occurred in Killeen, Texas, a stone's throw from Fort Hood. In 1991, George Jo Hennard drove his pickup truck through the window of a Luby's cafeteria in Killeen, jumped out and began firing two pistols at the defenseless customers and employees inside, killing 23 of them.\n \n One customer, Suzanna Hupp, saw Hennard gun down her parents.\n \n Hupp later testified that she had brought a handgun with her that day but, to her bitter regret, left it in her car, as required by state law. The massacre led the Texas legislature to approve a \"shall issue\" law that allows any resident who meets certain objective criteria to obtain a concealed carry permit.\n \n But people with such permits are still barred from bringing their weapons into areas designated as gun-free zones. And when a killer fires on people he knows will be unarmed, it matters little whether he has 20-round or 10-round magazines, a detail emphasized in press coverage of the Fort Hood massacre. The second or two it takes to switch magazines is a minor nuisance when the people you are shooting at cannot shoot back.\n \n Even less relevant is the allegation that Hasan used illegal armor-piercing ammunition. The Brady campaign bizarrely chose to highlight that claim even though there was no indication that any of Hasan's victims were wearing bulletproof vests, let alone that his bullets penetrated them.\n \n Perhaps the group hoped that such puzzling illogic would distract people from the plain fact that having a gun is better than not having one when you are confronted by a homicidal maniac.\n",

   "Guns in the US - The Irish Times - Sat, Nov 07, 2009\n \n THE TRAGIC shootings in Fort Hood, Texas, have drawn attention again to the frightening availability of guns in the US - a staggering 97 guns for every 100 people. Although the killings took place on an army base, neither of the pistols used were army-issue. And the state of Texas, ranked 27th by a gun control lobby group in terms of the ease with which guns can be bought, has no requirement that handgun buyers obtain a licence or undergo any type of safety training. Police do not know how many guns are in the state or where they are.\n \n US domestic firearm sales are likely be about $3 billion in 2009, two to three times the usual amount. The dramatic surge in demand coincided with the election of President Obama, partly - observers say - out of concerns that he would move to tighten controls despite his conservatism on the issue, and partly in response to fears of economic calamity.\n \n Chillingly, at a number of anti-Obama demonstrations over the summer, protesters openly flaunted weapons. In Pittsburgh one strutted through the crowd with an AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle over his shoulder. Such weapons were banned for a time until a bipartisan retreat following pressure from the gun-lobby.\n \n The Fort Hood massacre recalled other mass shootings in the US, including 13 killed at a centre for immigrants in upstate New York last April, the deaths of 10 during a gunman's rampage in Alabama in March and 32 people killed at Virginia Tech in 2007.\n \n But such episodes and the country's 12,000 gun homicides a year - three-quarters of them with handguns - have only had a peripheral impact in recent years on legislative or judicial attempts at control. The Senate in July narrowly voted down a provision to allow gun owners with valid permits from one state to carry concealed weapons in other states. But in May, Congress allowed gun owners with proper permits to carry loaded and concealed weapons in national parks.\n \n The Supreme Court in September agreed to consider whether states are bound by an important ruling last year when it decided, in a case restricted to federal application, that the constitution protects an individual right to own firearms rather than just a collective right tied to state militias. The decision struck down parts of gun control law in the District of Columbia, a federal enclave. Precedent suggests the court will allow individual states to exercise their own discretion. Unfortunately, in most cases, that will not mean greater gun control.",

   "Critics Point to 'Terror Gap' in Gun-Control Laws - Declassified Blog - Newsweek.com\n \n New details about the case of accused Fort Hood shooter Nidal Malik Hasan is refocusing attention on what critics call a glaring \"terror gap\" in federal firearms laws that has allowed hundreds of suspected terrorists to purchase weapons in recent years. \n \n A General Accounting Office study last summer found 963 instances in which individuals on the FBI's terrorist watch lists sought to purchase guns between February 2004 and February 2009.\n \n In 90 percent of those cases, or 865 times, the terror suspect was permitted to buy the gun because. under the rules governing a federally mandated background check, they did not fall within a number of prohibited categories, such as being a convicted felon, an illegal immigrant, or a fugitive from justice.\n \n The Hasan case is bringing a new focus on those figures-and what they say about federal firearms laws. Senior federal investigators have declined to say whether Hasan, the suspect in the Fort Hood shooting, was ever on the FBI's terror watch list, but all indications so far are that he probably wasn't.\n \n Still, officials have confirmed that the bureau conducted \"an assessment\" of Hasan earlier this year after discovering that he had between 10 and 20 e-mail communications with Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical imam now living in Yemen who had been vigorously investigated by the bureau for years because of his association with two of the 9/11 hijackers.\n \n But even while an FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force was reviewing Hasan and his activities to determine if he might pose a threat, the bureau's counterterrorism officials were never informed about another arguably relevant piece of information that had popped up in a separate FBI computer database last summer: on August 1, Hasan had bought a high-powered semiautomatic FN 5.7 handgun.\n \n (It turns out that Hasan in 1996 also had gotten a \"concealed\" gun permit in Virginia that would haven been transferable to Texas. When he submitted his Virginia application, he submitted a certificate showing he had taken an NRA gun-safety course.)\n \n Not only was the information about Hasan's August 2009 handgun purchase not shared with the Joint Terrorism Task Force that was monitoring Hasan's communications with Awlaki, the records would have been immediately destroyed under a provision known as the Tiahrt Amendment.\n \n Named for Rep. Todd Tiahrt, a Kansas Republican and a staunch backer of gun ownership, the amendment requires the Justice Department to destroy all records of a gun purchase within 24 hours after the buyer's purchase once it has been approved by a computerized background check run by the FBI's National Instant Check System.\n \n \"This shows the huge gap\" in federal firearms laws, said Kristen Rand, legislative director for the Violence Policy Center, a group that has campaigned for tighter restrictions on gun purchases. \"He's buying a gun that is known as a cop killer and which is used by Mexican drug cartels. That should have set off alarm bells.\"\n \n For the past several years, gun-control groups have pushed legislation, sponsored by Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Democratic Rep. Carolyn McCarthy of New York, that would deny gun purchases to individuals on the FBI's terrorist watch list. The argument of Lautenberg and others is that if somebody is deemed too dangerous or suspicious to board an airplane, they shouldn't be permitted to buy a weapon. Lautenberg's bill would go even further, permitting the attorney general to use his or her discretionary authority to deny a gun to anybody \"suspected\" of providing \"aid\" or \"material support\" to terrorism.\n \n But the provision has run into resistance from the NRA-and gone nowhere in Congress. Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, says it is the NRA and its friends in Congress such as Tiahrt, that restrict basic information sharing among federal agencies about gun purchases. \"It's the paranoia of the gun lobby,\" he said. \"They don't want anybody sharing any information about who is buying guns.\"\n \n But NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said there's nothing about the Hasan case so far that argues for changing any laws or federal procedures. \"We believe there's no reason for any government agency to keep records on any law-abiding citizen who buys a gun,\" he said.",

But so are our handgun laws -- or lack of them.\n \n You'd think you might have heard a bit more about our heedless national pistolero mentality in the wall-to-wall TV coverage of the tragic shootings at Fort Hood this week. But no such luck. How many times have we seen this movie before? It's only the locations that change.\n \n There was only scant mention in all the coverage that suspected mass murderer Nidal Hasan had bought his lethal cop-killer handgun at \"Guns Galore\" in nearby Killeen, Texas. How charming.\n \n Why is it that comic Stephen Colbert seems to be the only one on national TV who regularly reminds us about this country's twisted love of handguns? (Colbert keeps his piece, \"Sweetness,\" under his anchor desk, occasionally taking it out to smooch its barrel).\n \n Something I've written in my newspaper columns about for years bears repeating here:\n \n Any country with as many mentally ill people as the U.S. that allows virtually unlimited access to handguns is on a suicide mission.\n \n Gun sickness is our most pressing national illness.\n \n I live within sight of the Canadian border, and Americans who visit Canada are often surprised at how serious Canadian customs officials regard guns -- specifically, bringing them into relatively handgun-free Canada. Where are these people's priorities, they seem to be saying?\n \n (Note: Canadian customs can -- and does -- turn people back at the border who have a DUI conviction. Again, different national priorities).\n \n Canadians recognize handguns as a direct threat to civilized society, unlike here, where the NRA and the gun-toters evidently believe we're living in Tombstone, Ariz., circa 1885.\n \n How many more mass shootings and troubled-loner gun sprees (what the New York Post calls \"Slayfests\") can we afford before we finally get serious about gun control? How much longer will network TV news continue to soft-peddle and play down this most basic issue?\n \n I don't really care that much about what drove Hasan to apparently murder all those soldiers, which has been the prime focus of nonstop cable news. The fact is, he did. What I DO care about is how easy it was for him to get the means -- a lethal gun -- to do it.\n \n Not to belabor the Canadian issue -- we Americans are, after all, the noisy, gun-toting downstairs neighbors -- but re-entering the U.S. after living in Canada for several years (which we did) was a maddening experience.\n \n We lived a major metropolitan area, Montreal, for seven years. And even in the more disadvantaged parts of that city, you feel safe. You never feel you might get shot, either by a handgun-toting robber or a troubled loner.\n \n Coming back into the United States you lose that peace of mind. It's like a slap in the face.\n \n Don't believe me? Ask anyone else who's lived in a developed country in which handguns are restricted and can't be bought as easily as cigarettes.\n \n We have millions of sick Americans who need health insurance. But there are even more of us who live in danger of being shot by an easy-to-obtain weapon. It's way past time for the media to pay attention to THIS life and death issue.",

   "Bill Mann: Handgun Crowd Returns Fire Post Fort Hood -- No Surprise Here\n \n A radio talk-show host once confided: \"If you want to light up the phones, just talk about abortion or gun control.\"\n \n It works for blogging, too. My piece here earlier this week, saying that the key issue, handgun control, has been largely neglected in cable's saturation coverage of the Fort Hood murders, brought out the gun-nut crowd, big time.\n \n (This reminds me of that darkly apt joke: Two nuts were walking down the street. One was a salted).\n \n Little has changed with the handgun groupies. Certainly not their point of view (summary: \"The Second Amendment is the revealed word of God\"), no matter how many lone-gunman shooting sprees we have.\n \n And the anti-handgun control arguments posted here? Staler than last year's Christmas fruitcake (an apt metaphor for a lot of these pious pistoleros).\n \n C'mon, NRA and its acolytes: Time to freshen the material.\n \n Here are some of the golden oldies trotted out to explain (justify?) the latest handgun bloodbath. I paraphrase at times:\n \n 1. \"Nidal Hasan used the Internet. Should we also ban the internet?\"\n No, Einstein, just doorknobs like those that got him into that building. Doorknobs can be as lethal as handguns. I think Chairman Wayne (Lapierre) said that.\n \n 2. \"Many of MY guns are bought for historical significance.\"\n You mean, like the ones that killed Garfield, McKinley, and Kennedy? Ever thought of collecting coins instead?\n \n 3. \"You cite Canada as being anti-handgun. Did you know it's about to repeal its gun ban?\"\n Yes, I did. But that repeal movement is directed at the Rifle and Shotgun Registry, not handguns. And it's probably not gonna happen. Try reading actual news stories, Baretta Boy.\n \n 4. One anti-gun Commenter asked: \"Can anyone could name another mass murder that DIDN'T include guns?\" The NRA crowd was all over this one instantly: The Oklahoma City bombings, they fired off notes en masse.\n OK, you got us on that one. Now, how about the other 50 or so, committed with guns and handguns?\n \n 5. \"The gun didn't kill anyone. A person killed them.\"\n I'll let Commenter kcdrew field this oldie: \"You're right. Guns don't kill people. People WITH guns kill people.\"\n \n 6. \"Guns -- on an Army base? What a surprise,\" said one pro-gun jokester, whom we'll call \"Shecky.\"\n Hey Shecky, I can answer this one from personal experience: My father was a career U.S. Army officer; I grew up on Army bases. The only way you can obtain a gun on a base is to sign one out at the armory, and only then for a good reason Ironically, U.S. military bases are often far safer than the cities outside them - because this part of the government, anyway, has stricter gun-control laws. That is, unless a soldier has visited Guns Galore in Killeen...\n \n 7. \"Guns are banned in the U.K., but they're having knife crisis.\"\n Hmmm. Google News doesn't turn up any instance of recent mass murders in the U.K. with knives.\n \n 8 \"For gun laws to work, you have to assume people will follow them.\"\n No, you don't. You do, however, start arresting those who break handgun laws (which should be felonies.). It's not perfect by any means, but you have to start somewhere.\n \n 9. \"If the students at Virginia Tech had been allowed to carry guns, the death toll would have been a lot lower.\"\n Yes, allowing untrained, gun-toting and hormone-driven young males to pack heat on campus sounds like a great idea. I told this one to a cop I know, and he started laughing.\n \n And finally, the inevitable fallback position:\n \n \"Owning a gun is a constitutional right.\"\n OK, so how's that well-regulated militia unit you're part of working out for you?",

   "Is the NRA partly responsible for the Fort Hood Shooting?\n \n Is the NRA partly responsible for the Fort Hood Shooting?\n \n Yes, I'm afraid so.\n \n The Gun Nut Lobby (GNL) did a very good job at eviscerating the gun-check law. When US Army Major Nidal Hasan purchased a super powerful pistol for the purpose of killing several of his fellow soldiers, the law required a background check which was processed by one part of the FBI as per usual. That information ... that there was a purchase of a deadly weapon ... could not be made available in any other way, so the other part of the FBI, which was busy looking into Hasan as a possible security threat, was not allowed to know about it.\n This doesn't even make sense even for you.\n Gun Nuts: You owe the family members of those slain at Fort Hood an apology, and you should not expect them to accept it. Your misguided paranoid libertarian fears and your inappropriate political meddling have made real and effective gun control legislation impossible. That really has to stop, and perhaps the formation of a \"Fort Hood commission\" will help bring some sense to this issue.\n\n \n Sorry Brady with your nutjob reasoning. You don't have the power to define the situation. Since you don't its false. Tell us among your other activities beyond lighting fires and torturing small animals would you be stalking?",

   "THE TRAGIC shootings in Fort Hood, Texas, have drawn attention\n\n \n To the fact that soldiers are banned from carrying guns on base.\n \n \nagain to the frightening availability of guns in the US -\n\n \n If you're frightened by mere inanimate objects, seek professional psychological help.\n \n \na staggering 97 guns for every 100 people.\n\n \n Good. A constitutional right should be widespread in the nation, it shouldn't be restricted to the select few who have political connections.\n \n \nAlthough the killings took place on an army base, neither of the pistols used were army-issue. And the state of Texas, ranked 27th by a gun control lobby group in terms of the ease with which guns can be bought, has no requirement that handgun buyers obtain a licence or undergo any type of safety training.\n\n \n So the fact that the shooter was a major in the United States army means nothing? You're so wrapped up in the notion that mandatory training is necessary, the fact that he was military is beside the point? You don't trust the government to educate its employees in proper procedure?\n \n \nPolice do not know how many guns are in the state or where they are.\n\n \n What business do the police have in knowing military affairs?\n \n \nUS domestic firearm sales are likely be about $3 billion in 2009, two to three times the usual amount. The dramatic surge in demand coincided with the election of President Obama, partly - observers say - out of concerns that he would move to tighten controls despite his conservatism on the issue, and partly in response to fears of economic calamity.\n\n \n Two words for you: President. Clinton. Look at the mess we got when the last democratic president was in office. People have a right to be concerned.\n \n \nChillingly, at a number of anti-Obama demonstrations over the summer, protesters openly flaunted weapons.\n\n \n Anti-Obama demonstrations?\n \n \nIn Pittsburgh one strutted through the crowd with an AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle over his shoulder.\n\n \n Yeah and he was a black man. Are you saying even black people hate Obama?\n \n \nSuch weapons were banned for a time until a bipartisan retreat following pressure from the gun-lobby.\n\n \n Nope, never happened. They were never banned in any way, shape, or form in a national level.\n \n \nThe Fort Hood massacre recalled other mass shootings in the US, including 13 killed at a centre for immigrants in upstate New York last April, the deaths of 10 during a gunman's rampage in Alabama in March and 32 people killed at Virginia Tech in 2007.\n\n \n Every last single one of them, took place in a gun free zone.\n \n How many times do you have to burn your hand in the fire before you realize that's not a good idea?\n \n \nBut such episodes and the country's 12,000 gun homicides a year - three-quarters of them with handguns - have only had a peripheral impact in recent years on legislative or judicial attempts at control. The Senate in July narrowly voted down a provision to allow gun owners with valid permits from one state to carry concealed weapons in other states.\n\n \n Next time there will be success. We came within spitting distance of stomping separatists out for good.\n \n \nBut in May, Congress allowed gun owners with proper permits to carry loaded and concealed weapons in national parks.\n\n \n Good. Drug cartel members are growing marijuana in our parks, they're no longer safe havens.\n \n \nThe Supreme Court in September agreed to consider whether states are bound by an important ruling last year when it decided, in a case restricted to federal application, that the constitution protects an individual right to own firearms rather than just a collective right tied to state militias. The decision struck down parts of gun control law in the District of Columbia, a federal enclave. Precedent suggests the court will allow individual states to exercise their own discretion. Unfortunately, in most cases, that will not mean greater gun control.\n\n \n Mumbai slaughter. Did greater gun control save them?\n \n I didn't think so.",

   "New details about the case of accused Fort Hood shooter Nidal Malik Hasan is refocusing attention on what critics call a glaring \"terror gap\" in federal firearms laws that has allowed hundreds of suspected terrorists to purchase weapons in recent years. \n \n A General Accounting Office study last summer found 963 instances in which individuals on the FBI's terrorist watch lists sought to purchase guns between February 2004 and February 2009.\n \n In 90 percent of those cases, or 865 times, the terror suspect was permitted to buy the gun because. under the rules governing a federally mandated background check, they did not fall within a number of prohibited categories, such as being a convicted felon, an illegal immigrant, or a fugitive from justice.\n\n \n If the government has enough information on these people to call them terrorists, why haven't they been arrested and shipped off the Guantanomo Bay for indefinite detention without legal council?\n \n If they've done nothing wrong, they don't deserve to be subjected to meaningless restrictions.\n \n \nThe Hasan case is bringing a new focus on those figures-and what they say about federal firearms laws. Senior federal investigators have declined to say whether Hasan, the suspect in the Fort Hood shooting, was ever on the FBI's terror watch list, but all indications so far are that he probably wasn't.\n\n \n If he wasn't on the watch list, then what good would your proposals do do deny a firearms purchase to \"terrorist suspects\"?\n \n \nStill, officials have confirmed that the bureau conducted \"an assessment\" of Hasan earlier this year after discovering that he had between 10 and 20 e-mail communications with Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical imam now living in Yemen who had been vigorously investigated by the bureau for years because of his association with two of the 9/11 hijackers.\n\n \n So?\n \n \nBut even while an FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force was reviewing Hasan and his activities to determine if he might pose a threat, the bureau's counterterrorism officials were never informed about another arguably relevant piece of information that had popped up in a separate FBI computer database last summer: on August 1, Hasan had bought a high-powered semiautomatic FN 5.7 handgun.\n\n \n \n First, the FN 5.7 isn't anywhere near high-powered. Second, if there's a gap in information sharing, blame the ATF. Or better yet, blame the FBI since that's who the background checks are called into.\n \n \n(It turns out that Hasan in 1996 also had gotten a \"concealed\" gun permit in Virginia that would haven been transferable to Texas. When he submitted his Virginia application, he submitted a certificate showing he had taken an NRA gun-safety course.)\n\n \n And he was a military soldier.\n \n \nNot only was the information about Hasan's August 2009 handgun purchase not shared with the Joint Terrorism Task Force that was monitoring Hasan's communications with Awlaki, the records would have been immediately destroyed under a provision known as the Tiahrt Amendment.\n\n \n Unlike you I've actually read the Tiahrt Amendment. There's no provision for destroying records, only for marking them \"for law enforcement use only\".\n \n \nNamed for Rep. Todd Tiahrt, a Kansas Republican and a staunch backer of gun ownership, the amendment requires the Justice Department to destroy all records of a gun purchase within 24 hours after the buyer's purchase once it has been approved by a computerized background check run by the FBI's National Instant Check System.\n\n \n Actually this has been the law 1986.\n \n \n\"This shows the huge gap\" in federal firearms laws, said Kristen Rand, legislative director for the Violence Policy Center, a group that has campaigned for tighter restrictions on gun purchases. \"He's buying a gun that is known as a cop killer and which is used by Mexican drug cartels. That should have set off alarm bells.\"\n\n \n What good will the gun do without the penatrator rounds? Does the gun somehow magically supercharge ordinary ammunition and turn it into a ballistic missile that'll punch a hole through an engine block front to back?\n \n \nFor the past several years, gun-control groups have pushed legislation, sponsored by Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Democratic Rep. Carolyn McCarthy of New York, that would deny gun purchases to individuals on the FBI's terrorist watch list.\n\n \n And as you said Hasan wasn't on the watch list.\n \n \nThe argument of Lautenberg and others is that if somebody is deemed too dangerous or suspicious to board an airplane, they shouldn't be permitted to buy a weapon.\n\n \n Wouldn't it be better to just arrest them instead of letting them roam freely?\n \n \nLautenberg's bill would go even further, permitting the attorney general to use his or her discretionary authority to deny a gun to anybody \"suspected\" of providing \"aid\" or \"material support\" to terrorism.\n\n \n What's the qualifications for being marked as a suspected terrorist? List them.\n \n \nBut the provision has run into resistance from the NRA-and gone nowhere in Congress.\n\n \n And it shouldn't either.\n \n \nPaul Helmke, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, says it is the NRA and its friends in Congress such as Tiahrt, that restrict basic information sharing among federal agencies about gun purchases. \"It's the paranoia of the gun lobby,\" he said. \"They don't want anybody sharing any information about who is buying guns.\"\n\n \n There are no laws preventing one federal agency from sharing information with another.\n \n \nBut NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said there's nothing about the Hasan case so far that argues for changing any laws or federal procedures. \"We believe there's no reason for any government agency to keep records on any law-abiding citizen who buys a gun,\" he said.\n\n \n Shouldn't we be seeing how many terrorists are occupying the various branches of the government?",

Nidal Malik Hasan walked into the Guns Galore gun store in Killeen, Texas, and legally purchased the FN Herstal tactical pistol that authorities believe was used to massacre soldiers at Fort Hood.\n\n \n Don't give a damn.\n \n \nAn FBI background check under the National Instant Background Check System was done when Hasan purchased the pistol -- but that information was never shared with the Joint Terrorism Task Force in Washington, which was aware that Hasan had repeatedly contacted a radical imam suspected of having ties to al Qaeda.\n \n The FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force ran down intelligence leads relating to Hasan late last year but closed the inquiry sometime in early 2009.\n\n \n So now the FBI isn't sharing information with the FBI?\n \n \n\"The piece of information about the gun could have been critical,\" said former FBI Special Agent Brad Garrett. \"One of the problems is that the law sometimes restricts you in what you can do.\"\n\n \n And suppose Hasan had gone suicide bomber instead.

But no such luck. How many times have we seen this movie before? It's only the locations that change.\n \n There was only scant mention in all the coverage that suspected mass murderer Nidal Hasan had bought his lethal cop-killer handgun at \"Guns Galore\" in nearby Killeen, Texas. How charming.\n \n Why is it that comic Stephen Colbert seems to be the only one on national TV who regularly reminds us about this country's twisted love of handguns? (Colbert keeps his piece, \"Sweetness,\" under his anchor desk, occasionally taking it out to smooch its barrel).\n \n Something I've written in my newspaper columns about for years bears repeating here:\n \n Any country with as many mentally ill people as the U.S. that allows virtually unlimited access to handguns is on a suicide mission.\n \n Gun sickness is our most pressing national illness.\n \n I live within sight of the Canadian border, and Americans who visit Canada are often surprised at how serious Canadian customs officials regard guns -- specifically, bringing them into relatively handgun-free Canada. Where are these people's priorities, they seem to be saying?\n \n (Note: Canadian customs can -- and does -- turn people back at the border who have a DUI conviction. Again, different national priorities).\n \n Canadians recognize handguns as a direct threat to civilized society, unlike here, where the NRA and the gun-toters evidently believe we're living in Tombstone, Ariz., circa 1885.\n \n How many more mass shootings and troubled-loner gun sprees (what the New York Post calls \"Slayfests\") can we afford before we finally get serious about gun control?

I see I was wrong about that.\n \n You have a spare tire just in case? Just in case of a car accident? In case your engine explodes? In case someone hijacks your car?\n \n Congratulations, Winston. You have made by far the most asinine post I have ever seen. And you are the most asinine person I have ever seen.\n \n \nthey are cowards, simply cowards who s*h*t in their pants if they are not hiding behind the skirts of their moms of stroking a gun under their beds.\n Ironically the more they lobby to own more and more guns the easier they make it for loonies and criminals to acquire guns.\n\n \n Such ignorance. Once again, you have no proof that gun owners are not ordinary people. We have continually refuted this point with mere logic and common sense, yet you continue to stand by it.\n \n Whoever told you this about gun owners was feeding you a warm, steaming pile of horse s###.\n \n \nBut only a mentally retarded person can feel at less risk of being shot in a place where guns abound than in a place where they are none.\n\n \n If you ever visited the U.S., in a nice, quiet, peaceful town like I live in when you learned that CCWs are issued here, you'd p### yourself. The only reason you fear a typical gun owner is because you're so paranoid that you actually believe that there's a reason to be afraid. There isn't. If I met you in person and knew it was you, I would not shoot you. In fact I'd try to be friendly. I don't know if you would though, seeing that your unreasonable hatred for gun owners is equivalent to racism.\n \n \nThey just repeat the mantra: \"guns don't kill, guns don't kill .... \"\n \n They are crazy, they are nuts, and as Billy Joel sang: \" you should never argue with a crazy man\" specially one packing an arsenal.\n\n \n You're the one who isn't in your right mind, your perception of a gun owner makes me wonder if you need professional help.",

   "wrong again\n \n The Tiahrt Amendments also mandate the destruction of certain gun background check data after only 24 hours.\n\n \n The full text of the Tiahrt Amendment, down to the last comma:\n \n \"AMENDMENT TO THE COMMERCE, JUSTICE, STATE, AND JUDICIARY APPROPRIATIONS BILL, 2005\n \n OFFERED BY MR. TIAHRT\n \n Page 16, strike the proviso beginning on line 17 and insert ''Provided further, That no funds appropriated under this or any other Act with respect to any fiscal year may be used to disclose part or all of the contents of the Firearms Trace System database maintained by the National Trace Center of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives or any information required to be kept by licensees pursuant to section 923(g) of title 18, United States Code, or required to be reported pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (7) of such section 923(g), to anyone other than a Federal, State or local law enforcement agency or a prosecutor solely in connection with and for use in a bona fide criminal investigation or prosecution and then only such information as pertains to the geographic jurisdiction of the law enforcement agency requesting the disclosure and not for use in any civil action or proceeding other than an action or proceeding commenced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, or a review of such an action or proceeding, to enforce the provisions of chapter 44 of such title, and all such data shall be immune from legal process and shall not be subject to subpoena or other discovery in any civil action in a State or Federal court or in any administrative proceeding other than a proceeding commenced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to enforce the provisions of that chapter, or a review of such an action or proceeding; except that this proviso shall not be construed to prevent the disclosure of statistical information concerning total production, importation, and exportation by each licensed importer (as defined in section 921(a)(9) of such title) and licensed manufacturer (as defined in section 921(a)(10) of such title):''.\n \n Conform page 29 of the Committee Report by striking clause (6) of the 4th undesignated paragraph under the heading ''Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives-salaries and expenses'', and inserting at the appropriate place the following:\n \n 1. In the last two fiscal years the Committee has expressed serious concern that, contrary to provisions of the 2 Gun Control Act, as amended, and Congress' intent, certain sensitive law enforcement information contained in 4 databases maintained by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) have been subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and through court action to the public, including civil litigants, firearm manufacturers and distributors, public interest groups and governmental entities, for use other than in bona fide criminal investigations and prosecutions. The Committee concern is not related to budgetary considerations. The intent has been to enforce existing Federal\n law limiting disclosure of this sensitive law enforcement information solely to law enforcement, and, to the extent current Federal law does not already so restrict disclosure to so provide now.\n \n It is of great concern that releases have occurred, and if repeated, may result in wide-spread disclosure of this information to the public at large. This holds the potential of endangering law enforcement officers and witnesses,\n jeopardizing on-going criminal investigations and homeland security. The need to maintain these sensitive law enforcement databases on a restricted, confidential basis in accordance with the law and ATF disclosure practices\n in place for years derives from the sensitive and long-term nature of criminal investigations. In addition, such information, once released, might easily be disseminated through the Internet. This would endanger law enforcement and homeland security, and violate the privacy of innocent citizens and businesses.\n \n The Committee is concerned by recent actions in Federal courts in which litigants have tried to nullify the effect of the language that was enacted to ensure the confidentiality of this information. The Committee therefore includes language (Section -----) to make clear that ATF shall not make these law enforcement records available to anyone other than to law enforcement agencies for a bona fide criminal investigation. The language makes clear that applicable law enforcement records may be used by ATF in civil enforcement proceedings (such as license revocations) authorized by the Gun Control Act (chapter44 of title 18, United States Code).\n \n At the same time, the Committee is concerned that the previous language has been interpreted to prevent publication of a long-running series of statistical reports on products regulated by ATF. This was never the intention of the Committee, and the new language should also make clear that those reports may continue to be published in their usual form as they pose none of the concerns associated with law enforcement sensitive information.\"\n \n Kindly show where in the text it states that records must be destroyed within 24 hours.\n \n \nLicensed gun dealers conduct background checks before they sell guns to customers. The background checks are conducted using the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). When the sale is permissible, the dealer receives a \"proceed\" message. The NICS system creates a log of its search. But the Tiahrt Amendments provide that the NICS log must be destroyed within 24 hours of this \"proceed\" message, allowing only non-identifying information to be maintained. For example, the purchaser's name and social security number are purged from the system, precluding future searches using identifying information. This can be particularly problematic in cases where a gun's serial number has been obliterated, making it impossible to trace the gun.\n\n \n And what about Form 4463 records that dealers are required to keep for a period of 20 years? Are these useless and serve no purpose, even though the include all the information about the buyer and the gun itself?\n \n If they're useless then why is it a federal offense to lie on them?\n \n \nBut even while an FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force was reviewing Hasan and his activities to determine if he might pose a threat, the bureau's counterterrorism officials were never informed about another arguably relevant piece of information that had popped up in a separate FBI computer database last summer: on August 1, Hasan had bought a high-powered semiautomatic FN 5.7 handgun.\n\n \n No matter how many times you say it, the FN 5.7 isn't a \"high powered handgun\", the civilian legal ammo can't penetrate body armor, and Hasan's purchasing of it is irrelevant.\n \n \nso the part of the FBI that does background checks couldnt let the part of the FBI that investigates terrorists know about the gun purchase of the deadly FN 5.7 thanks to the law you support!\n\n \n If the FBI is keeping secrets from itself then that's not the fault of us. It's their fault for being too large to run efficiently.\n \n The simple solution, and the best, is to downsize all levels of government until they can't screw up any further.",

Brady knows very well that when I lose patience with someone I am not above expressing it through ridicule, but it was not my intention to set up such a situation with the offer expressed in my last post.\n\n \n Bryan I must say that you are the closest to being a saint that I have come across. I wish I could emulate you but unfortunately I am way to mortal. Colored as it were by my own past experiences and prejudices I don't do arrogance and stupidity very well. You are correct in the amount of poison here. Myself being guilty as any. I think it is a normal response to respond in kind to poison with poison. Perhaps the only ones who might respond are Gallileo and Sinjin. At least they do try on occasion to have sources and debate. The rest of the control side are one line poison pills. ",

   "Time to revisit firearms policies on military posts | The Barr Code\n \n \nThis month's tragic - and probably preventable - mass shooting at Ft. Hood, Texas, certainly raises questions about why a lone shooter was able to unload not one but several magazines of ammunition over a several minute period - shooting and wounding more than 30 soldiers and killing 13, at a heavily restricted US Army base. Just as legitimate questions were raised following the mass killings on the Virginia Tech campus in 2007, both military personnel and civilian citizens alike ought now to be asking of themselves and our elected and appointed leaders, not only whether the perpetrators of such carnage could reasonably and appropriately have been identified in advance and prevented from carrying out their obviously well-planned mass murders; but also, whether it makes sense to disarm a captive group of citizens (at Virginia Tech, the student body; at Ft. Hood, the military personnel assigned to the base).\n \n In the case of Ft. Hood, it is important to bear in mind that since 1993, thanks to a policy ordered by then-President Bill Clinton, it has been essentially unlawful for individuals on military bases to carry firearms unless they are military police, or are training in firearms at a firing range. Many of those who support this gun-free military base policy have reacted to calls to review it, by simply echoing the standard refrain of gun-control advocates that, \"we don't want everyone on a military base running around with a gun on their hip.\" (Of course, had this been the case at Ft. Hood, it is doubtful Maj. Hasan could have squeezed off more than a couple of rounds before being himself felled by an armed soldier.) It is a false dichotomy that we either allow no one (except MPs) or everyone on military bases to possess firearms. Rather, the debate should center on why is it made virtually impossible for any soldier on a military base to carry arms, even if they have in fact been properly vetted and trained in their use? \n \n Why, after all, should a citizen be forced to surrender his or her right to keep and bear arms, simply because they have entered military service; service expressly supposed to teach the proper and safe use of firearms? \n \n In the case of the students at Virginia Tech two years ago, it was Virginia legislators who decided to disarm them and make them sitting ducks for a single crazed gunman, Seung-Hui Cho. For the military victims at Ft. Hood this Fall, it was three commanders-in-chief (Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama), and a series of politically-correct base commanders, who rendered those who serve under them vulnerable to an apparent religious zealot bent on killing as many of his fellow service men and women as he could. Continuing to stick our heads in the sand and refuse to even reconsider amending such policies as those that apply to campuses in Virginia (and other states across the country) and at Ft. Hood (and virtually every other military post across the country), vastly improves the chances that our students and our military personnel will be victims of other deranged individuals in the future.\n",

   "Federal Bureau of Investigation - Press Release\n \n \nThe FBI continues to work closely with the Department of the Army in the joint, ongoing investigation into the tragic events that occurred last Thursday at Fort Hood. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the victims and their families.\n \n With respect to the investigation-the Army Criminal Investigative Division is leading a coordinated criminal investigation with the support of the FBI and other components of the Department of Justice and the Texas Rangers. The investigation is in its early stages, and the information we can provide now is limited.\n \n With respect to what the FBI is doing-personnel from the Counterterrorism Division, Laboratory Division, and the Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG) are on site in support of the tragedy. The personnel deployed by the Laboratory and CIRG are specialists in crime scene analysis, evidence collection, and shooting incident reconstruction. Our victim assistance teams are working closely with their counterpart Department of Defense specialists, and we will continue to provide whatever resources are necessary to support the investigation.\n \n At this point, there is no information to indicate Major Nidal Malik Hasan had any co-conspirators or was part of a broader terrorist plot. The investigation to date has not identified a motive, and a number of possibilities remain under consideration. We are working with the military to obtain, review, and analyze all information relating to Major Hasan in order to allow for a better understanding of the facts and circumstances that led to the Fort Hood shooting. Understandably, there is a large volume of information in various forms, and it will take us some time to complete this work.\n \n There has been and continues to be a great deal of reported information about what was or might have been known to the government about Major Hasan prior to the shooting.\n \n Major Hasan came to the attention of the FBI in December 2008 as part of an unrelated investigation being conducted by one of our Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs). JTTFs are FBI-led, multi-agency teams made up of FBI agents, other federal investigators, including those from the Department of Defense, and state and local law enforcement officers. Such task forces are designed to bring investigators and analysts into a collaborative, information-sharing environment in order to maximize the collective impact of the respective agencies. \n \n In this case, the JTTF included investigators and analysts from, among other agencies, the FBI and the Department of Defense's Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS). Investigators on the JTTF reviewed certain communications between Major Hasan and the subject of that investigation and assessed that the content of those communications was consistent with research being conducted by Major Hasan in his position as a psychiatrist at the Walter Reed Medical Center. Because the content of the communications was explainable by his research and nothing else derogatory was found, the JTTF concluded that Major Hasan was not involved in terrorist activities or terrorist planning. Other communications that the FBI was aware of were similar to the ones reviewed by the JTTF.\n \n Standard protocols-based on federal law, regulations, and policy, including the Privacy and Freedom of Information Acts-govern information handling in federal task force settings, including JTTFs. JTTF-generated information may only be disseminated outside the structure of the JTTF (including to a member's home agency) with the approval of the JTTF FBI supervisor. In this case, following the review and analysis conducted by investigators, there was a conclusion made by the investigator and the supervisor that Major Hasan was not involved in terrorist activities or planning. Further dissemination of the information regarding Major Hasan was neither sought nor authorized.\n \n Our top priority is to ensure that the person responsible for the Fort Hood shooting is held accountable. The ongoing investigation includes forensic examinations of Major Hasan's computers and any Internet activity in hopes of gaining insight into his motivation. But the investigation to date indicates that the alleged gunman acted alone and was not part of a broader terrorist plot.\n \n After meeting with the President, FBI Director Robert Mueller ordered a review of this matter to determine all of the facts and circumstances related to this tragedy and whether, with the benefit of hindsight, any policies or practices should change based on what we learn.\n \n Again, this is a joint, ongoing criminal investigation that continues to move forward on many fronts. There is still much to learn. As a pending criminal case, the government remains limited in what information can be disclosed publicly about a U.S. citizen under investigation. As with any criminal investigation, all suspects are presumed innocent unless and until they are proven guilty of a crime in a court of law.\n\n \n So obviously the FBI felt that Hasan wasn't a threat. Obviously there was no reason to deny the purchase, nor would the purchase itself be suggestive that he might be planning to go out and murder people.\n \n So pushers of the \"closing the terrorist loophole\" agenda just shut the **** up!",
