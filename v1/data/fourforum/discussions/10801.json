   "Simple psychology.\n \n When things are good, we can afford to care about others.\n When things are bad, we can only afford to care about ourselves.\n \n The war, IMO, was just an excuse by many to vent hate at Bush (right or wrongly) and the Republicans who 'stole the election'. People, unless they are directly involved (such as via family members and freinds in Iraq), don't have the inbuilt psychology to really care about others unless it also serves them somehow. There are a few exceptions to this hardwiring but in general it holds true. \n It's why we won't bat an eye over conflicts and catastrophies in foreign countries that don't impact our lives or aren't shoved down our throats by someone elses media campaign.\n \n Yep, 9 soldiers died recently in Iraq. People who mostly volunteered to be there. *yawn*. Almost as tragic as the recent car pile ups in the US that resulted in more deaths.\n So, while you may see a distinction, it's still people I don't know nor care about. \n My more pressing concerns happen when it affects my life. Is the spending of untold trillions on these wars good for me at any point in my life?\n Will the economy work out well and my job be secure or will it become a luxury task I perform and I be out...and possibly join those who are loosing their homes to foreclosures...",

   "Look, we all know that the war was started to, in some ways, sure up our energy market. We thought if we had a bargaining chip in between Iran and Saudi Arabia, we would have more influence over their policies and Governing bodies. Oh so wrong we were. There is never going to be a chance to leave Iraq as a peaceful, secure, and stable country, therefore winning is in the eye of the beholder. Furthermore, regardless of whether or not we leave earlier or later, there will still be an abundance of broader regional interest in Iraq. Any of Iraq's neighboring countries will attempt to assert their ideals within the secular groups of Iraq which will create a prime setting for the rise of a new Iraqi Dictator (can anyone say Al Sadr). We can't be Isreals older protective brother forever and we sure as hell can't change the ideals of the middle eastern nations. Maybe we should just pull-out, regroup, and resupply so we are actually ready for the next Iraq war. Neither the Demoncrats nor the Retardicans have a clue on what to do and we as a Country are way overdo for a true Revolution. As for me, I'll have the soup de jour, you know the coup d'etat. Sounds tasty =)!!!",
