   "New FASB rule 125 is coming into effect. What this essentially does is forces banks to assign actual values to their level 3 assets, brings them fully on the balance sheet, and holds thier auditors responsible for the numbers they generate in relation to these assets.\n \n Level three assets are also known as \"MArk to make believe\". They are thinly traded securities that banks more or less jsut assign a value to. In the past auditors have let them get away with this because the banks indemnified them in the event of an error. No more. Now those level 3 assets have to be included in the audits and the auditors cannot jsut take whatever number the bank gives them and write it down. \n \n I jsut saw this really interesting interview with a a guy from merrilll lynch who was warning that because of this move there is a greater than 50% chance of a total economic collapse in the US. The funny thing is that he then went on to say that right now our economy is pretty strong and that even though we are seeing a downturn, there is still a great deal of inherint strenght...as long as they can do somethig to stop credit agencies from downgrading bonds and keep the current system where auditors jsut report what banks tell them to report.\n \n I don't know about you, but personally I have to question the \"strength\" of an economy that is basically based on a bunch of people lying about how much money they have. That does not exactly scream \"house made of brick\" to me. \n \n In other news, Paulson has pretty much announced the failure of the super SIV bailout fund. IT has not even opened yet, but apparently they have realized that repacking repackaged junk is not going to make people want to buy it. I would wager a bet that even if you put a bow on those big streaming piles of dog ####, they still would not be flying off the shelf. Paulsons reasoning for trying anything so desperate at all? \"Anything is worth trying\"\n \n At least we get to see a good train wreck.",

   "Meh,\n \n I can add on to what you said I suppose. Your concerns are probably not that big of a deal. I believe you object to the fair valuing of something that is hard to fair value or has no observable means to fair value. The standard really doesn't say these have to be on or off the balance sheet but rather clarifies how you account for them. Below is a quote from the actual statement about Level 3 inputs:\n \n \nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, that is, an exit price from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability. Therefore, unobservable inputs shall reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (including assumptions about risk). Unobservable inputs shall be developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which might include the reporting entity's own data. In developing unobservable inputs, the reporting entity need not undertake all possible efforts to obtain information about market participant assumptions. However, the reporting entity shall not ignore information about market participant assumptions that is reasonably available without undue cost and effort. Therefore, the reporting entity's own data used to develop unobservable inputs shall be adjusted if information is reasonably available without undue cost and effort that indicates that market participants would use different assumptions.\n\n \n I don't think that is as bad as you think....then again I don't like fair value :)",

Up until now these were all (as I understand it) either intermixed with all other assets or off the balance sheet. \n \n The problems here are two fold. First of all, most of the stuff that is thinly traded is thinly traded because it is toxic, so we are now going to be able to tell exactly how much of a financial entities holdings are made of of toxic garbage that they invented values for.

Also, as I understand it, they are no longer allowed to autmatically mark to model thinly traded assets and that the conditions for doing so have changed.\n\n \n I hope we are talking about the same thing (although not many standard came out recently) and if this is the case it really doesn't break assets into 3 tiers for banks only but rather any asset for any company is broken up into three different ways to \"value\" i guess you could say. Essentially this standard is a set up for 159 which makes fair value allowable and, if I had to bet, fair value will be required in the not too far off future. \n \n As for banks those assets might be considered \"level 3\" assets because you really can't value them accurately as they are not sold in the open market. The level 3 assets were (prior to this standard) generally either valued at 0 (thus off the balance sheet) or valued at whatever the company felt like it should be because no one can dispute this. In reality nothing really changed and this rule only solidified what has been common practice. I think some got scared because they felt they might have to prove more what the value is and they have no idea how they will value it. I don't think this will happen but the bigger worry is companies using level 3 assets to their advantage to pay with the asset number to achieve the ratios they want. I suppose they could do this before but now its a rule.\n \n Here is a good example of what level 3 assets do: http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&sid=aY8m0nta94GA&refer=columnist_weil\n \n Now, as I stated, I don't like fair value and the reasoning behind that hatred is that the numbers can be played with too easily.....and the proof is in the pudding.",
