   "I recently heard someone complaining about a religious studies class being in public schools in the gay rights forum so I thought I'd bring up that topic here. So far in my high school experience it has been far from separated from religion. I'm actually not complaining I just want to know what others think about it. I think as long as it is taught in an objective tone it's fine. In English class last year we read \"The Chosen\" which was about a fight between 2 branches of the Jewish culture and how 2 kids struggled to be friends despite their fathers being complete enemies in the Jewish comunity. It goes through everything. It quotes the Torah, talks about an experience at a religious meeting. I personally don't mind. It can't hurt to learn more, even if it's about religion, but some seem to disagree. When we studied the Native Americans we studied their view on creation vs. Christianity's view (7 days theory). This is a little closer to teaching religion in schools but again it was a \"Christians believed the world was created in 7 days, contrast that to the Native American's beliefs\". Now this year in French class we are learning about holidays including religious ones. We would be given sentences for example (it would be in French though) \"This was the holiday Jesus Christ was born\" and we would answer Noel (Christmas). These are all in required courses to graduate (9th grade English, 9th grade US History) except for French which is pretty much required to get into a good college and never said anything about religions, just learning French. that course is French 3. Would other people have problems with something like that? I personally don't have that much of a problem since no one is trying to tell me any belief is right, but I can see how some people could take offense to it.",

This makes no sense. I hope that's not what you mean, but it sounds like you're saying it's fine to teach Christianity but we must moderate in case the teacher extends to teaching other religions such as Islam, etc.",

I think pnac has a good idea to offer an alternative theological study in schools where you could choose to study. Although believe in the Christian doctrine, I still find other religions' take on creation, morals, and so forth.",

Legally I don't think schools should be able to sponsor clubs but they could still meet on school grounds. But this is not so now. Every morning we have \"infoflow\" where they give us information about clubs, announcements, etc. Many times there has been an advertisement for Christian club. I don't personally have an objection, but only school-sponsored activities are allowed to put their announcements on so that means the Christian club is school-sponsored. I don't know I really don't have a problem with that kind of thing, why is that bad?",

Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state. And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts, records, and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect thereof.\n \n Section 2. The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.\n \n A person charged in any state with treason, felony, or other crime, who shall flee from justice, and be found in another state, shall on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime.\n \n No person held to service or labor in one state, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.\n \n Section 3. New states may be admitted by the Congress into this union; but no new states shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states, or parts of states, without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the Congress.\n \n The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States, or of any particular state.\n \n Section 4. The United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be convened) against domestic violence. \n\n I guess that everyone in every state is guaranteed the rights in the bill of rights and that only a republican form of govt is allowed in each state, so that rules out a regime led by high priests.\n \n But, that doesn't mean that congress had to make any law establishing or restricting. The congress of the republican govt of a state can make such laws, then. Or, a municipality may make such laws, depending on the state constitution. They could say that all city public schools will have 5 prayer times each day where every student is required to pray toward Mecca with some guy singing \"Allahu akbar.\"\n \n All the constitution says is that the US congress shall make no law.\n It doesn't mention state or municipal laws.",
