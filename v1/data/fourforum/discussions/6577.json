   "Anyone? I am hard pressed to see the difference between organized religion and cultism. I mean, the general definition of a cult would be, what, something like, \"Has a charismatic leader, followers blindly support it,\" type thing? Dictionary.com defines it as:\n --A religion or religious sect generally considered to be extremist or false, with its followers often living in an unconventional manner under the guidance of an authoritarian, charismatic leader. \n --The followers of such a religion or sect. \n --A system or community of religious worship and ritual. \n --The formal means of expressing religious reverence; religious ceremony and ritual. \n --A usually nonscientific method or regimen claimed by its originator to have exclusive or exceptional power in curing a particular disease. \n \n --Obsessive, especially faddish, devotion to or veneration for a person, principle, or thing. \n --The object of such devotion. \n --An exclusive group of persons sharing an esoteric, usually artistic or intellectual interest. \n \n Its definition for religion is as follows: \n --Belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers regarded as creator and governor of the universe. \n --A personal or institutionalized system grounded in such belief and worship. \n --The life or condition of a person in a religious order. \n --A set of beliefs, values, and practices based on the teachings of a spiritual leader. \n --A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion. \n \n So, what do you all define them as?",

   "Gosh, there are people that 'go to church' that deny reason, logic, have an anti-science stance, and are bigoted and hateful. Why would anybody \"go to church\" to learn that behavior?\n\n \n \n 2 reasons. First, the only other place that excells quite so well at teaching those lessons is the big white supremacist compound in Idaho. Idaho is too far to drive for most people. The local baptist chirch is much closer. The white supremacist amke more sense than any of the evangelical christians you are likely to find there, but very few people can afford the drive to Idaho every weekend.\n \n Second, and maybe you have missed this one. There is an invisible man who lives in the sky who is all knowing and all seeing. If you do his bidding (which apparently includes being stupid, bigotted, and hateful), he will reward you with many camels and sheep and wives. And he needs money (though what an invisible man in the sky needs your money for I will never understand). If you do not give him money (apparently the priests pass it on), you will not get your camels and sheep and wives.\n \n On second thought, it may be cheaper to save your money and get your own camels and sheep, then use what is left to hire prostitutes.",

Cults carry the perception of being slightly dodgy, insular and so on but technically I see little difference. I suppose back in less secular times a cult would be any religion that wasn't the official State sponsored one and often forced to worship in secret. Today I'd say a cult is a minority religion, one that isn't generally accepted or known of.",
