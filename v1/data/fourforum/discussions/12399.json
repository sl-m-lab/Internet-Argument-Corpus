   "The following is from \"The End Of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason\" by Sam Harris.\n \nThe young man boards the bus as it leaves the terminal. He wears an overcoat. Beneath his overcoat, he is wearing a bomb. His pockets are filled with nails, ball bearings, and rat poison.\n \n The bus is crowded and headed for the heart of the city. The young man takes his seat beside a middle-aged couple. He will wait for the bus to reach its next stop...The next stop comes into view. The bus doors swing...New passengers have taken the last remaining seats and begun gathering in the aisle. The bus is now full. The young man smiles. With the press of a button he destroys himself, the couple at his side, and twenty others on the bus. The nails, ball bearings, and rat poison ensure further casualties on the street and in the surrounding cars. All has gone according to plan.\n \n The young man's parents soon learn of his fate. Although saddened to have lost a son, they feel tremendous pride at his accomplishment. They know that he has gone to heaven and prepared the way for them to follow. He has also sent his victims to hell for eternity. It is a double victory. The neighbors find the event a great cause for celebration and honor the young man's parents by giving them gifts of food and money.\n \n These are the facts. This is all we know for certain about the young man. Is there anything else that we can infer about him on the basis of his behavior? Was he popular in school? Was he rich or was he poor? Was he of low or high intelligence? His actions leave no clue at all. Did he have a college education? Did he have a bright future as a mechanical engineer? His behavior is simply mute on questions of this sort, and hundreds like them. Why is it so easy then, so trivially easy--you-could-almost-bet-your-life-on-it easy--to guess the young man's religion?\nHowever, as Harris points out, such suicidal terrorism is not limited to members of Islam. There is an Hindu cult in Sri Lanka that also engages in similar suicidal terrorism. Although it claims secular motivation, this cult is characterized by martyr worship and influenced by certain beliefs about the nature of life and death common to Hinduism. Other Hindu sects do not engage in such practices.",

   "In comparison to Arab culture prior to Islam, Islamic treatment of women was revolutionary. Certainly some of the laws look outdated in the light of western feminism, but Islam now looks a darn sight more pro-women than western society did 100 years ago.\n\n \n Really? Got any evidence for this beyond your unfounded opinion? Were western women required to walk 10 steps behind their husbands a hundred years ago? Or considered property with absolutely no human or civil rights as they still are today in islam, just as was instituted by Mohamed 1500 years ago? \n \n You inconsistent hypocrites constantly claim how America was run by religious bigots in the 18th and 19th centuries, yet you go on to imply that men could murder their wives without legal consequences as still happens in islam as we speak by making such a ridiculous comparison. So please show evidence of how islam improved the rights and freedoms of women over what they had in 500 AD before islam existed. \n \n Until then, read this link about Wahabiism, which is a 19th century sect of islam which promotes following the literal values which moahamed promoted in the Quran. http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS21695.pdf&ei=hiSpSYP_OaKBtwfRqcDrDw&sa=X&oi=spellmeleon_result&resnum=2&ct=result&cd=1&usg=AFQjCNGCOV5bKYiUF6LiYEbPV3OFbEXRAA \n \n In other words, Wahab set the move for women's rights in islam back 1500 years, rather than forwarding them. And that is the basis for the violent fundamentalist islamic ethic which we see in modern islamic terrorism today.\n \n \nThe \"raw material\" a religion provides can be applied in most varied ways. Just like Christianity can be a religion of peace, so can any religion. Of course, it can also be used to justify atrocities.\n\n \n This is nothing more than personal opinion which is incorrect in two fundamental and obvious areas. \n \n ONE: Show where the original, and still existing fundamental Gospel of Jesus followed by believers like me was violent or oppressive in any way since it preached peace and loving ones enemies from the outset? It also gave women dignity and respect which was greater than what they had under traditional Judaism of the day.\n \n \nJust compare JoBennet and Archangel, for example.\n\n \n TWO: Please do compare Jo with me. Jo claims a form of religiosity but denies the power there of by rejecting the biblical/moral principles of the Gospel which Jesus promoted, endorsed and defended. Jo will reject OT principles even though Jesus quoted many of them in His teachings. What Jesus rejected of the Pharisees was their legalistic interpretation of the OT which held people in bondage to dietary laws, being slaves to the Sabbath and making unfair demands on the poor etc. etc. \n \n I on the other hand defend and promote the original and yes, I dare say it, the fundamental Gospel of Christ and His Apostles which holds to His teachings which endorses loving ones neighbor, praying for ones enemies and never compromising the word of God in order to be accepted or respected by those who live according to the lies promoted by this world. This passage is speaking directly to people like Jo who claims to believe yet denies the truth of God and His word. \n 1Ti 6:3 If anyone teaches otherwise and does not consent to wholesome words, [even] the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which accords with godliness,\n \n 1Ti 6:4 he is proud, knowing nothing, but is obsessed with disputes and arguments over words, from which come envy, strife, reviling, evil suspicions,\n \n 1Ti 6:5 useless wranglings [fn] of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a [means of] gain. From such withdraw yourself. [fn]\n Now tell me again iuris, how does an accurate comparison between me and Jo stack up based on the fact that we both claim to be christians who follow Christ? Which of us is the religious hypocrite? \n \n this passage below is what the word of God tells christians to honor with their lives and the truths they represent. Note the bolded. That is what I live by here on 4forums and in life. I don't give my personal opinions which would be based on my very flawed personal preferences and character but I promote rebuke and exhort according to Gods word.\n 2Ti 4:1 I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at [fn] His appearing and His kingdom:\n \n 2Ti 4:2 Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.\n But here below is what Jo represents in his every post as he claims to be a bible believing christian. Yet he represent only his personal perspectives regarding the things of God, never ever defending the truth of Gods moral value system at all.\n 2Ti 4:3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers;\n \n 2Ti 4:4 and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.\n \nIslam simply hasn't gone through a proper mellowing period that would properly soften it like most christianity has. Yet.\n\n \n I have proven just the opposite is true above by showing that the rise of wahabiism has led to the growth of the fundamentalist version of islam which existed under Mohammed himself 1500 years ago. So rather than getting enlightened over the centuries, islam continues to wallow in the original barbarism which it originally was built upon. \n \n You may find my statement harsh, but that is often the way of the truth which ultimately hurts much less than denying it does for those who ignore in favor of the convenient lie or the self delusion which you apologists constantly do regarding the very real dangers of what radical islam represents in the world today.\n \n \nAlso note that terrorism has little to do with any religion. It's more of a political thing that is a part of reacting to perceived external threat in which religion is simply the point around which people concentrate.\n\n \n More balderdash where islam is concerned. Haven't you heard of Sharia Law? And aren't you aware that the Governments of islam are controlled by their interpretation and application of the laws through Sharia and the Hadith within the Quran? After decades of dealing with the realities of what radical islam truly represents, my only question is how can you leftists continue to be deceived and deluded about what this extremist religion of darkness truly represents for the world today through its radical element?",

The west has nothing to do with the principles upon which Christianity is based. Just as islam can't be judged by the east. It is what the followers of the faith endorse and commit in the name of their God that is worthy of being judged. \n \n And the true followers of Christ believe in the same tenets which He taught 2000 years ago, and those are love for ones neighbors, praying for ones enemies and unbelievers, not killing them as religious infidels.\n \n What you have conveniently ignored once again is that radical islam lives by the tenets of Wahabiism which promotes a fundamentalist enforcement and submission to the tenets of what mohammed's version of islam. And every rational person can see that to translates to oppressive forced submission of the commoner; condemnation for free thought by moslems, the execution via beheading for perceived infidels and unbelievers in islam, the right and responsibility to lie and deceive to any opponent in order to gain time to regroup and destroy that perceived enemy. \n \n That you either ignore or deny these realities speaks volumes regarding your lack of common sense in discerning good from evil, and the fact that religiously speaking, the prophet mohammeds version of Islam is the exact opposite of what true, Jesus based Christianity stands for. \n http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS21695.pdf&ei=hiSpSYP_OaKBtwfRqcDrDw&sa=X&oi=spellmeleon_result&resnum=2&ct=result&cd=1&usg=AFQjCNGCOV5bKYiUF6LiYEbPV3OFbEXRAA\n 4 \n Michaela Prokop, \"Saudi Arabia: The Politics of Education,\" Int. Affairs, 79, no. 1, pp. 77-89. \n 5 \n Approximately two million Shiites are citizens of Saudi Arabia. Report available online at \n []Page not found. \n 6 \n Ahmad Dallal, \"Appropriating the Past: Twentieth-Century Reconstruction of Pre-Modern \n Islamic Thought,\" Islamic Law and Society 7, no. 1 (Leiden, 2000): 347. \n 7 \n Jihad literally means \"striving\" or \"struggle.\" It is frequently used to refer to a \"holy war,\" \n although this term does not appear in the Quran but in a number of hadith or recorded sayings \n of the Prophet Mohammed and his companions. \n Political and Religious Factors \n What Is Salafiyya? As noted above, among adherents in general, preference is \n given to the term \"Salafiyya\" over \"Wahhabism.\" These terms have distinct historical \n roots, but they have been used interchangeably in recent years, especially in the West. \n Wahhabism is considered by some Muslims as the Saudi form of Salafiyya. Unlike the \n eighteenth-century Saudi roots of Wahhabism, however, modern Salafi beliefs grew from \n a reform-oriented movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, which \n developed in various parts of the Islamic world and progressively grew more \n conservative. In line with other puritanical Islamic teachings, Salafis generally believe \n that the Quran and the Prophet's practices (hadith) are the ultimate religious authority in \n Islam, rather than the subsequent commentaries produced by Islamic scholars that \n interpret these sources.6 Salafiyya is not a unified movement, and there exists no single \n Salafi \"sect.\" However, Salafi interpretations of Islam appeal to a large number of \n Muslims worldwide who seek religious renewal in the face of modern challenges. \n The Use of Violence. According to a number of scholars, the waging of violent \n jihad7 is not inherently associated with puritanical Islamic beliefs. Among certain \n puritanical Muslims - be they self-described Salafis or Wahhabis - advocacy of jihad\n CRS-4 \n 8 \n See CRS Report RS21654, Islamic Religious Schools, Madrasas: Background. \n 9 \n See Council on Foreign Relations Independent Task Force on Terrorist Financing, \"Update on \n the Global Campaign Against Terrorist Financing,\" June 15, 2004, p. 20. \n is a relatively recent phenomenon and remains highly disputed within these groups. \n Although Wahhabi clerics and converts have advocated religiously motivated violence \n and played military roles at key moments in Saudi history, most scholars date the \n ascendancy of militancy within the wider Salafi community to the war of resistance \n against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan during the 1980s. The war against the \n Soviets gained wide support throughout the Muslim world and mobilized thousands of \n volunteer fighters. Radical beliefs spread rapidly through select groups of mosques and \n madrasas (Islamic religious schools),8 located on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, which \n were created to support the Afghan resistance and funded primarily by Saudi Arabia. \n Similar U.S. and European funding provided to Pakistan to aid the Afghan mujahideen \n also may have been diverted to fund the construction and maintenance of madrasas. \n Following the war, militant Salafis with ties to the Afghan resistance denounced leaders \n of countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt as \"apostates\" and as vehicles for facilitating \n Western imperialism. The Taliban movement also emerged from this network of \n institutions. \n Violent Salafist-inspired groups such as Al Qaeda continue to advocate the \n overthrow of the Saudi government and other regimes and the establishment of states that \n will sustain puritanical Islamic doctrine enforced under a strict application of shari'a or \n Islamic law. Although the majority of Salafi adherents do not advocate the violence \n enshrined in Bin Laden's message, violent Salafist ideology has attracted a number of \n followers throughout the Muslim world. Analysts note that some receptive groups are \n drawn to the anti-U.S. political messages preached by Bin Laden and his supporters, \n despite the fact that these groups may hold different religious beliefs. \n Recent Allegations against Wahhabism and Responses \n There have been two major allegations against Wahhabism and against the Saudi \n Arabian government, which is viewed as its principal proponent: \n \"Wahhabism Spreads Terrorism\"? It is widely acknowledged that the Saudi \n government, as well as wealthy Saudi individuals, have supported the spread of the \n Wahhabist ideas in several Muslim countries and in the United States and Europe. Some \n have argued that this proselyting has promoted terrorism and has spawned Islamic \n militancy throughout the world.9 Saudi funding of mosques, madrasas, and charities, \n some of which have been linked to terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda, has raised concern \n that Wahhabi Islam has been used by militants who tailor this ideology to suit their \n political goals and who rely on Saudi donations to support their aspirations. \n \"Wahhabism Spreads Intolerance\"? Some reports suggest that teachings \n within Saudi domestic schools may foster intolerance of other religions and cultures. A \n 2002 study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) indicates that \n \"some Saudi textbooks taught Islamic tolerance while others viciously condemned Jews\n CRS-5 \n and Christians...[and] use rhetoric that was little more than hate literature.\"10 Others also \n have argued that the global spread of Wahhabist teachings threatens the existence of more \n moderate Islamic beliefs and practices in other parts of the world, including the United \n States.11 A 2005 report from Freedom House's Center for Religious Freedom cites \n examples of what its authors calls \"hate ideology\" taken from a number of Saudi \n government publications that have been distributed in U.S. mosques and Islamic centers.12 \n Recent attention to Wahhabi clerics in Saudi Arabia has focused on harsh sectarian \n rhetoric accusing Shiite Muslims in Iraq and elsewhere of religious apostasy and political \n disloyalty worthy of punishment. An October 2006 petition signed by 38 prominent Saudi \n religious figures called on Sunnis everywhere to oppose a joint \"crusader [U.S.], Safavid \n [Iranian] and Rafidi [derogatory term for Shiite] scheme\" to target Iraq's Sunni Arab \n population.13 \n ",

I have also shown in this same post which you redacted with nothing more than a sarcastic quip that Gods relationship with the jewish people through whom Messiah came to the world goes back to Abraham who lived around 2000 BC. 2000 years later Jesus came to die for the sins of Man.

I have also shown in this same post which you redacted with nothing more than a sarcastic quip that Gods relationship with the jewish people through whom Messiah came to the world goes back to Abraham who lived around 2000 BC. 2000 years later Jesus came to die for the sins of Man. That was 2000 years ago. So Gods relationship with the Jew goes back 4000 years ago from the present. \n \n If our acceptance of Messiah is a natural progression of that event, it is illogical to then claim it is a cult.\n\n 1) Prove I am wrong.\n 2) How on earth can you talk about logic with a straight face?\n \n \nNo need to as you rip a memory of an exchange out of context. I believe we were discussing murderers whom I wanted to have live the same miserable lives in prison which they imposed on their victims and their families. Beside, I am not the definition of Christ's holiness, grace or mercy, so holding me up as an example of it is a strawman argument and is far different than further victimizing the Jewish people who are innocent victims of terrorist and rocket attacks by a people who refuse to make peace with them under any circumstances.\n\n Actually you were just wishing the prisoners the same misery as those who languish in italian prisons. Either way it is not a christian attitude to take. But then you're not really a christian, you just profess to be.\n \n \nActually smiley, this is another strawman. I haven't ever claimed that Israel is above reproach and hasn't made any mistakes at all. All I am saying is that God has a covenant with Israel which is everlasting in spite of the fact that God also knows the sins of His people. \n\n So your thread on only hamas being to blame for the war was just a slip was it?\n \n \nNot at all. I just expect you to see the hypocrisy of those who claim to be christians while never defending or standing up for the principles it represents, and to realize that a true conversion can happen to anyone who accepts the Lord as their savior rather than being something one is born into. That's all.\n\n I do see hypocrisy in those who claim to be christians. You are a prime candidate.\n \n \nTell me smiley, in what way is this section of my post which you redacted self aggrandizing at all? Doesn't the bolded statement below speak to exactly the opposite of self aggrandizement?  \n To summarize, many call themselves christians but they live only according to their own personal agenda and sense of justice. Believers and followers of Christ like me abandon our personal opinions and adopt what God says is right according to His word/the bible, and based on the prodding of the Holy Spirit which indwells us. I am not my own anymore but am Christ's who indwells me. I'm a new creature in Christ and even though I haven't yet attained perfection in this flesh OBVIOUSLY; I live my personal life with the goal that I must decrease and He must increase within me. That is what being a true christian means.\n Jhn 3:30 He must increase, but I [must] decrease.\n Jhn 3:31 He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth is earthly and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.\n Jhn 3:32 And what He has seen and heard, that He testifies; and no one receives His testimony.\n Jhn 3:33 He who has received His testimony has certified that God is true.\n Jhn 3:34 For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure.\n Jhn 3:35 The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into His hand.\n Jhn 3:36 He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.\"\n These words are faithful and true. I can attest to them from personal experiences in my own life. Christianity isn't the act of living vicariously through others who tell us what to think or believe, it is the personal revelation by way of the Holy Spirit that what we know is true. So when I say that islam is a cult and a false religion, I don't just think or hope I am right. I know it and have committed my eternal soul on that fact. As for God's covenant with the Jew and Israel?\n Gen 17:5 No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you a father of many nations.\n Gen 17:6 I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come from you.\n Gen 17:7 And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and your descendants after you.\n Gen 17:8 Also I give to you and your descendants after you the land in which you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.\"\n Gen 17:9 And God said to Abraham: \"As for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations.\n And to this day, even though the Jew has denied Messiah, even after 1900 years as a dispersed people, they never lost touch with their culture as Jews, their traditions as Jews via this covenant God made with their Patriarch Abraham, nor have they ever given up on repossessing their God given homeland which God promised to them and gave to them so many thousands of years ago. I realize I gave more info than required, but you should rest in the knowledge that I could have kept going and decided this was already overkill. emoticon_frazzled\n\n I can tell you one thing about the bolded statement, you seem to be going in the wrong direction. If at some point you were less christian that you appear to be right now, then I find that hard to believe.",

   "Unbelievably incorrect!\n \n Do these seem like instructions to prepare yourself for attack?\n \n \n \n Are you aware of who has carried out the deadly attacks all over the world lately? Have you been reading the news lately?\n \n Radical Muslim groups (a small percentage of all Muslims) have been proudly claiming responsibility and encouraging more terrorism than all the Christians put together.\n \n I think one of you best argument techniques is to misrepresent the truth by presenting what sounds good for your argument as truth. Radical Muslims have been killing people for fun for hundreds of years...not in self defense, but in surprise attacks on innocent people. I'd like to see your statistics on similar killings by Christians outside of declared war.\n\n \n So declared war makes killing civilians ok? You disgust me.",

Thus, if you repent, it would be better for you. But if you turn away, then know that you can never escape from GOD. Promise those who disbelieve a painful retribution.\n \n [9:4] If the idol worshipers sign a peace treaty with you, and do not violate it, nor band together with others against you, you shall fulfill your treaty with them until the expiration date. GOD loves the righteous.\n \n [9:5] Once the Sacred Months are past, (and they refuse to make peace) you may kill the idol worshipers when you encounter them, punish them, and resist every move they make. If they repent and observe the Contact Prayers (Salat) and give the obligatory charity (Zakat), you shall let them go. GOD is Forgiver, Most Merciful.\n \n [9:6] If one of the idol worshipers sought safe passage with you, you shall grant him safe passage, so that he can hear the word of GOD, then send him back to his place of security.
