   "I have never seen Obama this intent on passing health care. He laid out the problem, but never bothered to actually look at the problems with his solution. He made sure to clearly state, plenty of Americans are uninsured, and going bankrupt because of medical bills. Right, because that totally gives us a really good reason to bankrupt the country even though less than one percent of americans, (roughly 3 million people) file for bankruptcy each year.\n Less than half of that (1.3 million people) files for bankruptcy because of medical debt. I know, it sucks that so many people are uninsured, but it is not like we have not had this problem before. The quick solution is to create jobs, so people can get health insurance, but no. Obama is more concerned with bankrupting the country. Think about it, 876 billion dollar stimulus, 2.4 trillion dollar health bill, not to mention the many pork barrel spending bills he has gotten through, or is about to. The republicans told him that it would cost more to implement this healthcare bill, than for the government to pay for all the uninsured people health bills. It was true, while health care is expensive, this bill is even more costly. It also is filled with god knows what pork, earmarks, and unconstitutional garbage that it would be insane to even try to pass! If Obama really wanted to be bipartasan, he would start over with the bill, or quit altogether and focus on what the american people want: Jobs. Is this really the bill you want? Do you think Obama is working in our best interests? I know he is owned by a corporation, but he is the president now with a supermajority. If he really cared, he would listen to the American people, come up with effective, common sense bills, and then implement them while trying to be as fiscally responsible as possible. He clearly is not doing that. So why should we be even trying to pass something that will bankrupt our country, when they are othe better, cheaper solutions?emoticon_confused",
