Creation theory is not taught in public schools, not by chance, but because...*gasp* it's RELIGIOUS MUMBO JUMBO. There is no evidence to support it. Creation fiction has made no progress with it's \"faith-based\" (lackofevidence) with rational people. \n \n And I'll also say that I'd welcome ad hominem over irrational thinking any day. Ad hominem is just a lack of patience, or someone who doesn't care to hide their emotion or opinion. Irrational thinking on the other hand is often only cured by death. Someone guilty of ad hominem can still hold a rational debate. The irrational..well, why bother? \n \n -Mach",

   "Montalban\n \n Your obsession with your lost debates isn't mentally healthy. Actually, you didn't debate - you just made assertions and then didn't seem to understand when your errors were explained.\n\n Yes, this is the exact same argument Waxy makes. Somewhere, someone else already made such an argument about such and such - you go one better by not even specifying which of the things I raised was retorted! This is amusing, I suppose 'all of them' would be your response. Touch\u00e9!\n \n \nWhy don't you tell everyone why \"on\" and \"the\" are both nouns. Don't be shy. You based an argument on that claim once before. Enlighten everyone.\n\n \n What do you mean that I based an argument. It was Lurch - most likely yourself in another guise - who raised it in the first place because he was upset with the use of a word I'd coined (see reference below - you should give credit where credit is due) :)\n \n That was the point in me stating my post above. I am interested in meanings of words, but as for 'word-games', I am not the sole player.\n \n Fortunately I keep accurate references (mainly spurred on by you raise the same retorts over and over again*)\n Post 80 of \"How does a new species come about?\"\n \nHey monty\n Are you not aware that the word \"evolutionary\" is an adjective? It only displays ignorance to try to use it as a noun.\n You must have a point in such intentional gramatical (sic) ignorance. Would you care to explain?\n When you say \"evolutionaries\" are you referring to evolutionary biologists? Not everyone on these boards is a biologist. Why do you insist on showing such ignorance?\n\n \n Later, same thread...\n \nMy point is that the word \"evolutionary\" is an adjective and you are using it incorrectly as a noun. You need to think before you write.\n\n \n \nWhy do you keep harping on about this. I used the term evolutionaries, a noun I have coined as in 'revolutionaries'. I've been using it now for months, and you just catch on, now?\n Evolutionary is not the same word.\n Evolution is the word TheoMorphic used. It is a noun. Just because you decide to talk past the point and say \"Evolutionary is an adjective\"\n In other words, why'd you even bother interjecting this really stupid point into the conversation?\n\n In other words, the 'word-game' was begun by the opposition, based on a misunderstanding as to which word I used. Very funny that this same poster would return countless times to the same mistake!\n \n I have a word document containing the bulk of what was said then. It's also easy enough to find it searching. If you want to start a new thread and take up where you left off, please do. :)\n \n Note, back then you posted no evidences to support your statements then, and I posted heaps (see posts 99, 104 etc of same thread). Your retort was 'no it isn't', even when I posted references on Functional Grammar from textbooks such as ), \"Using Functional Grammar: An Explorer's Guide\", and you'd repeat 'no it's not', very amusing. Then you left that argument, only to re-raise it again later on another thread, then I had to re-post my sources (you posted nil), and I posted new sources, and then realised I should keep a record under subject headings. This one is under \"Is it a Noun(?)\"\n \n But as I said, you're welcome to start a thread (though I'd suggest on under a different subject than this).\n \n \n * - they are, in no order of popularity\n a) the 'noun' debate\n b) a general attack over the understanding of English\n c) \n i) an attack over the lack of understanding of Biology\n ii) my failure in High School Biology (the only one of these arguments I have no problem with)\n d) an attack over not understanding Darwin\n e) questions over words; if they're actually insulting\n f) questions relating to something refuted somewhere else by someone else\n g) other word-games\n h) my arguments for one thing equals an argument for religion\n i) other sundry 'just-so' argument\n \n I may have missed some. :)",

   "Addendum:\n Some time ago a poster, Lurch, raised a specific debate on 'noun' twice (twice is all that I can recall that we actually 'debated' this) on these threads. Once on the \"How does a new species come about?\" thread, (see above), and then on the \"Grudgingly conceding some points\". In neither instance did he present any evidence to back up his claim, other than to make statements that I was wrong. And even refuted himself on the later thread...\n Post 303\n \nAnd, of course, there is the fact that the word \"evolutionary\" is an adjective, and no amount of insult or wishful thinking will change that. Even if \"evolutionary\" is used in the title of a book, it is still an adjective.\n It is sometimes difficult to deal with the semi-literate high school drop outs.\n\n then ....\n Post 317 \n \n\n Just like \"The Great Sandy Desert\" or the \"Grand Canyon\". Grand by itself functions as an adjective. Grand in Grand Canyon is part of the name. Names of things are nouns!\n\n Right. The whole title is a proper noun.\n\n Like the other thread, he dropped the subject after his fualt was pointed out. Since then he has raised the issue in his various Usernames, BUT only so far as to say that we had an argument somewhere else, and he successfully refuted my statement then, OR to say that I don't understand the difference between a noun and a verb. The funny thing is he did no such successful refutation; even as just shown, refuting his own argument. However it is typical to say that somewhere, some other time, someone else has already dealt with this subject. He is the master of this type of non-debate. It's sole purpose is to attempt to discredit someone using ad hominem. He doesn't actually bother to draw up a debate.\n Even here Accipitridae makes suggestions that I don't understand particular words, and when I asked him to present his version of 'chance', he just repeats that I don't understand the word. Again, the non-debate method is used.\n His other favourite revolves around Darwin's preference for a tautology, which most recently Waxy introduced in much the same manner - just repeating that I'd beenr refuted somewhere else, by someone else, at some other time. It is a great shame that such tactics would be used by my opposition. That they would continue to repeat such non-debate is no credit to them.\n And whilst where on the 'word-games' issue, I also draw your attention to this list that I had started to compile of such games raised by the opposition.\n Post 234\n \"Grudgingly conceding some points\" thread\n \n\n Meanings of words seem to dominate these debates, not just by me. As you have I'm sure seen, there has been intense debate over the following words\n science (in relation to maths)\n maths (in relation to math)\n circle (in relation to sphere)\n circular (in relation to sphere)\n spherical (in relation to round)\n and\n evolutionary and evolutionaries\n and\n species\n\n Thus I call on the opposition to understand 'insight'.",
