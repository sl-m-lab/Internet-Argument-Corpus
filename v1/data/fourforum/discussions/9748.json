And it has to - you know, the buck has to stop somewhere, and I'm assuming it's the attorney general and his immediate team,\" Gingrich said.\n \n \"How could you have so totally mishandled what was a slam-dunk?\" he said. \n\n \n He is 100% correct. This should have been a non issue, and it was turned into a major scandel by the bush administrations bumbling, and it seems that Gonzales had a lot to do with that. \n \n \n I don't know, or care, if he did anything wrong to begin with or not. His lack of judgement in how the mess has handled is, IMO, incompatible with his office. You simply do not want somebody with judgement that poor acting in a cabinet level position.",

   "The brownshirts are starting to distance themselves from the Bush administration like rats abandoning a sinking ship.\n \n This whole attorney scandal is nothing more than a smokescreen though since it's about as trivial as it gets compared to other things like GITMO, illegal wiretaps etc. I mean, it's perfectly normal for a President to get rid of \"disloyal\" attorneys. Bill Clinton fired 90+ attorneys when he came into office. \n The only difference between Bush and Clinton is that the attorneys usually get kicked out when a new President comes into office and not when he has been in office for a couple of years.",
