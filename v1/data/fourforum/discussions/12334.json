   "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) - Two Florida high school students on Tuesday sued their school board because they were not allowed to form a club that promotes the tolerance of gays.\n \n The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida filed the suit Tuesday in federal court on behalf of Yulee High School students Hannah Page, a freshman, and Jacob Brock, a junior.\n \n The lawsuit claims violations of the First Amendment and the Federal Equal Access Act. The act requires schools to grant access and recognition to a Gay-Straight Alliance and other groups if the school allows any extracurricular group to meet on campus, said ACLU attorney Robert F. Rosenwald.\n \n The lawsuit seeks a preliminary injunction to allow the club to meet at Yulee High while the case makes it way to trial.\n \n Page said the group just wants to meet like others do.\n \n \"We just want the club so that straight and gay kids can get together to talk about harassment and discrimination against gay kids in an open environment. The school is discriminating against us and that's exactly the kind of thing we want to prevent,\" she said.\n \n John L. Ruis, the school district's superintendent, said in a letter to Rosenwald that \"a club highlighting sexual orientations will not be permitted as it would violate school board policy.\" The Nassau County School Board was served with the lawsuit.\n \n The ACLU recently won a similar case in Okeechobee. A judge there ruled schools must provide for the well-being of gay students and cannot discriminate against the Gay-Straight Alliance.The Associated Press: Fla. school sued over refusing gay-straight club\n \n When will people learn?\n :xbanghead\n The Florida school will lose the case. They'll be left with a scenario of either choosing to end ALL extra-curricular clubs (a move that demonstrates extreme prejudice) or allowing the gay club and getting over not being able to impose their morality.\n \n Prom and other school dances encourage \"heterosexual\" orientation.\n Should we stop those as well?\n :xbanghead",
