I've only got a couple of pieces of heroic gear to grab then I'm ready to hit ICC 10 man and I can already do ToC 10 and 25 man in my current gear.\n \n Whats funny is that even though my gearscore is around 4800 and the other fury warrior in the guild has a gearscore of 5200 I do about double the dps he does easily.\n \n Just cause I know how to play my class emoticon_cool",
