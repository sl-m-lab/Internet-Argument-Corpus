   "http://www.rense.com/general14/brother.htm\n \n By Bud Kennedy\n budk@star-telegram.com\n Ft Worth Star-Telegram\n 9-27-1\n \n SCHERTZ - One chapter in the enigmatic story of Osama bin Laden might lead to a Texas pasture, where his oldest brother died 13 years ago in an accident that is still something of a mystery.\n \n What we do know is that Salem bin Laden, 42, and the oldest of Saudi Arabia's bin Laden brothers, was on one of his frequent visits to Texas when he and friends went out for a Sunday afternoon of fun - flying low-power ultralight aircraft at an air park north of San Antonio.\n \n What we don't know is why Salem bin Laden took off in the tiny aircraft and turned toward a nearby row of high-power electrical towers. He climbed, but not high enough to clear the upper power line. The Sprint ultralight got tangled and crashed into the ground 115 feet below.\n \n \"Of everybody who was there, nobody could figure out why he tried to fly over the power lines,\" said Gerry Auerbach, 77, of New Braunfels, a retired pilot for Saudi Arabian Airlines and for the bin Laden brothers, multimillionaire builders who long ago disowned Osama.\n \n \"It was kind of a weird deal,\" said Schertz police Lt. Stephen Starr, at the time the city's acting police chief. \"He just drifted up into the wires.\"\n \n It has been turned into an even weirder deal by conspiracy theorists - with the unlikely help of the Public Broadcasting Service.\n \n In the 2000 PBS Frontline special report, Hunting bin Laden, PBS reported that Salem bin Laden died in a 1988 Texas plane crash - not in a hobby-kit-type, one-man ultralight, but in a full-size British Aerospace BAC 1-11. The death \"revived some speculation that he might have been 'eliminated,' \" PBS reported, adding that an accident report was \"never divulged.\"\n \n That's news to Starr. He and officer Lori Flowers, now an officer in nearby Windcrest, wrote a report that remains public record.\n \n On May 29, 1988, they were called to the Kitty Hawk Field of Dreams Ultra-Lite Flying Field on the edge of Schertz, a San Antonio suburb. Bin Laden had already been taken by ambulance to an Army hospital in San Antonio, according to the police report. Officers found the crumpled remains of a crashed ultralight.\n \n No federal investigators came to the scene, Starr said. Federal investigators do not review ultralight or glider crashes.\n \n Salem bin Laden was not wearing a helmet and died of head injuries from the fall, the Bexar County medical examiner concluded. The wind was blowing about 30 mph, usually too strong to fly an ultralight.\n \n The Schertz officers interviewed several witnesses. Their report concludes simply: \"Freak accident.\"\n \n Now armed with the PBS misreport, some conspiracy writers think Osama bin Laden blames the United States for the death of his oldest brother, the family's leader throughout most of the 1970s and '80s after their father's death in 1967.\n \n \"I don't think so,\" Auerbach said. \"I flew Salem everywhere, and I never met Osama. I think I saw him once.\"\n \n That was in the 1970s. Osama bin Laden would have been a teen-ager. \"He walked through the room,\" Auerbach said.\n \n \"Salem said: 'Oh, that's my brother. He's probably going to pray.' \"\n \n Several of the bin Laden brothers - not Osama - owned a fleet of aircraft and visited Texas often in the 1980s, Auerbach said. He chartered a Texas company named Binladen Aviation to manage part of the family fleet.\n \n On that particular 1988 Sunday - over a drizzly and windy Memorial Day weekend - Salem bin Laden was visiting as a guest at the wedding of Auerbach's son, he said. Bin Laden had also planned to ask about having an older BAC 1-11 refurbished in San Antonio, Auerbach said. But he was simply out for fun with friends at the ultralight park that afternoon.\n \n \"He was outgoing, a little bit flamboyant - a nice guy,\" Auerbach said.\n \n He was expecting bin Laden to come by the house later that day.\n \n Now, Auerbach said he's \"like everybody else in America - I'm shocked.\"\n \n \"The fact that one of his brothers might be involved doesn't make any difference,\" Auerbach said. \"What matters is - there's a nut case out there somewhere on the loose.\"\n \n Things are weird enough.\n \n There's no reason to make a weirder story out of a tragic accident in Texas.",

   "to Billionaire bin Laden Brood\n \n http://www.americanfreepress.net/10_07_01/Bush___Bin_Laden_-_George_W__B/bush___bin_laden_-_george_w__b.html\n \n The unexplained death of Salem, Osama bin Laden's oldest brother, in 1988, brought to an abrupt end a long and intriguing relationship between President Bush and the head of the bin Laden family fortune. \n \n By Roger Miller\n \n The world now associates the bin Laden name with Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect be hind the terror atrocities of Sept. 11. As President George W. Bush leads an intense international manhunt for Osama, few Americans realize that Osama's eldest brother, Salem, was one of Bush's first business partners.\n \n A photograph from 1971 has surfaced and been printed in English papers showing Osama, age 14, and his brother Salem, age 19, enjoying a summer holiday at the Astoria Hotel in Falun, Sweden. Christina Akerblad, the hotel owner, told the Daily Mail, \"They were beautiful boys, so elegantly dressed. Everybody loved them.\"\n \n Osama embraced Islamic fundamentalism and is now the world's most wanted man. \"Salem went on to become a business partner of the man who is leading the hunt for his brother,\" the Daily Mail's Peter Allen said. \"In the 1970s, he and George W. Bush were founders of the Arbusto Energy oil company in Mr. Bush's home state of Texas.\"\n \n President Bush and the bin Laden family have been connected through dubious business deals since 1977, when Salem, the head of the bin Laden family business, one of the biggest construction companies in the world, invested in Bush's start-up oil company, Arbusto Energy, Inc.\n \n James R. Bath, a friend and neighbor, was used to funnel money from Osama bin Laden's brother, Salem bin Laden, to set up George W. Bush in the oil business, according to The Wall Street Journal and other reputable sources.\n \n Through a tangled web of Saudi multi-millionaires, Texas oilmen, and the infamous Bank of Credit and Commerce International, Bush was financially linked with the bin Laden family until Salem met an untimely end in a freak flying accident near San Antonio in 1988.\n \n The infamous BCCI was shut down in 1991 with some $10 billion in losses.\n \n In June 1977, George W. Bush formed his own oil drilling company, Arbusto Energy, in Midland, Tex. \n \n \"Arbusto\" actually means \"shrub\" in Spanish, but the Bush family interpreted it as \"bush\".\n Salem bin Laden, a close friend of the Saudi King Fahd had \"invested heavily in Bush's first business venture,\" according to The Daily Mail (U.K.).\n \n Arbusto later became Bush Exploration, when Bush's father became vice president. As the company neared financial collapse in September 1984, it was merged with Spectrum 7 Energy Corp. in an effort to stay afloat. \n \n The 50 investors who propped up the Bush company with $4.7 million were \"mainly friends of my uncle\" who \"did pretty good\" in Bush's words, although they lost most of the money they invested in the company. Jon Bush, George's uncle, raised money for Arbusto from political supporters of the Reagan-Bush administration. \n \n \"These were all the Bushs' pals,\" family friend Russell Reynolds told the Dallas Morning News in 1998. \"This is the A-Team.\" \n \n The \"A-Team\" limited partners contributed $4.67 million to various Bush funds through 1984 but got only $1.55 million back in profit distributions, and $3.9 million in tax write-offs. \n \n William DeWitt and Mercer Reynolds, two staunch Reagan-Bush supporters, owned Spectrum 7. \n \n Despite his poor track record, the owners made Bush president of the company and gave him 13.6 percent of the parent company's stock.\n surprise deal\n \n As the hard times continued, Spectrum merged with Harken Energy in 1986. In 1990, Harken received a contract from the government of Bahrain to drill for offshore oil although Harken Energy had never drilled a well overseas or anywhere in water. \n \n \"Knowledgeable oil company sources believe that the Bahrain oil concession was indeed an oblique favor to the president of the United States but say that Saudi Arabia (home of bin Laden) was behind the decision,\" according to The Outlaw Bank: A Wild Ride Into the Secret Heart of the BCCI, by Jonathan Beaty and S.C. Gwynne. \n \n It raised oil-industry eyebrows when the Persian Gulf state announced it had chosen tiny Harken to explore an offshore site for gas and oil. Bahrain officials said they had no idea President Bush's son was associated with Harken, a claim oil-industry sources ridicule. \n The Bahrain deal was brokered in part by Arkansas investment banker David Edwards, one of Bill Clinton's closest friends. The Bahrain oil project resulted in two dry holes and Harken energy abandoned the project.\n \n Two months before Iraq invaded Kuwait, on June 20, 1990, the younger Bush sold two-thirds of his Harken stock, 212,140 shares at $4 a share-for a total of $848,560. \n \"That was $318,430 more than it was worth,\" Dr. Arthur F. Ide, author of George W. Bush: Portrait of a Compassionate Conservative, said. \"George W. broke the law to do this since the transaction was an insider stock sale.\"\n \n Eight days later, Harken finished the second quarter with losses of $23 million and the stock went \"into a nosedive\" losing 75 percent of its value, finishing the year at a little over $1 a share.\n \n \"Like his father who made his fortune in the oil business with the money of others, George W. founded Arbusto with the financial backing of investors, including James R. Bath,\" said the late James Howard Hatfield, author of a \"controversial biography,\" Fortunate Son: George W. Bush and the Mak ing of an American President. \n \n Hatfield, 43, was found dead of an apparent prescription drug overdose in a hotel room in Springdale, Ark. on July 18, 2001. Police declined to investigate.\n \n (More)",

   "Bath became friends with George W. during their days together in the Texas Air National Guard. Bath \"confided that he was an original investor in George Bush Jr.'s oil exploration company,\" according to The Outlaw Bank. \n \n Bath found investors for Arbusto and \"made his fortune\" by investing the money of two BCCI-connected Saudi sheiks, Khalid bin Mahfouz and Salem bin Laden. Mahfouz was one of the richest men in the world and a controlling shareholder in BCCI.\n \n Bill White, a former real estate business partner of Bath, said: \"He had put up $50,000 to help George, Jr., get started in oil business\" at a time when \"Bath had no substantial money of his own,\" according to The Outlaw Bank.\n \n Bath received a 5 percent interest in two Arbusto-related limited partnerships controlled by Bush, although Bush told The Houston Post in 1990 that he had \"never done any business\" with Bath. However, Bush said Bath was \"a lot of fun.\"\n \n Bath told White that he was in the CIA and that \"he had been recruited by George Bush himself in 1976 when Bush was director of the agency . . . he said Bush wanted him involved with the Arabs, and to get into the aviation business.\"\n \n White contends that the Saudis were using Bath and their huge financial resources to influence U.S. policy during the Reagan and Bush administrations, according to the Houston Chronicle of June 4, 1992. Such representation by Bath would require that he be registered as a foreign agent with the Department of Justice, which he was not.\n \n Shortly after Bush's father was appointed director of the CIA, Salem bin Laden appointed Bath as his business representative in Texas. According to The Houston Chronicle, Salem bin Laden, heir to one of the largest building companies in the Middle East, signed a trust agreement appointing Bath as his Houston representative in 1976.\n \n In 1978 Bath purchased Houston Gulf Airport on behalf of Salem bin Laden. When bin Laden died in 1988, his interest in the airfield passed to bin Mahfouz.\n \n There was also a political aspect to Salem bin Laden's financial activities, which played a role in U.S. operations in the Middle East and Central America during the 1980s, \n according to Public Broadcasting's Frontline report.\n \n As head of Binladen Brothers Construction (now the Binladen Group), a company that later helped build U.S. airfields during Operation Desert Storm, bin Laden was close to King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and \"a good friend of the U.S. government,\" a San Antonio attorney, Wayne Fagan, who represented Salem bin Laden from 1982 to 1988, told the San Antonio Express-News.\n \n When the family patriarch, Sheik Mohammed bin Laden, died in 1968, he left an industrial and financial empire and a progeny of 54 sons and daughters, the fruit of a number of wives. In 1972, Salem bin Laden, the oldest son, took over the estate as his father's successor, with the assistance of several brothers.\n \n With over 40,000 employees, the Bin Laden Group is represented in the major cities of Saudi Arabia and the Arab capitals of Beirut, Cairo, Amman, and Dubai. The company builds highways, housing units, factories, hangars, and military bases, some of which are part of the U.S.-Saudi \"Peace Shield\" agreement.\n \n The story of the Bush involvement with bin Laden and the BCCI scandal involves \"trails that branched, crossed one another, or came to unexpected dead ends,\" according to The Outlaw Bank. \n \n FREAK ACCIDENT\n \n Salem bin Laden came to an \"unexpected dead end\" in a Texas pasture, 11 years after investing in Arbusto, when the ultralight aircraft he was flying crashed into power lines near San Antonio on Memorial Day, 1988. \n \n On the morning of May 29, 1988, almost immediately after takeoff, Salem bin Laden's aircraft struck and became entangled in power lines 150 feet high before plunging to the ground.\n \n \"He was a very experienced pilot. He was a good pilot. We just can't understand why he decided to go right instead of left,\" recalled airstrip owner and former Marine Earl May field, who cradled bin Laden, bleeding from the ears.\n \n That day, bin Laden took off in a southeasterly direction into the wind. He surprised onlookers by turning west to ward power lines less than a quarter-mile away.\n \n \"Nobody could figure out why he tried to fly over the power lines,\" said Gerry Auerbach, 77, of New Braunfels, a retired pilot. \n \n Bin Laden had more than 15,000 hours of flight experience.\n \n The police report concluded \"freak accident.\" H",

   "to Billionaire bin Laden Brood\n \n http://www.americanfreepress.net/10_07_01/Bush___Bin_Laden_-_George_W__B/bush___bin_laden_-_george_w__b.html\n \n The unexplained death of Salem, Osama bin Laden's oldest brother, in 1988, brought to an abrupt end a long and intriguing relationship between President Bush and the head of the bin Laden family fortune. \n \n By Roger Miller\n \n The world now associates the bin Laden name with Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect be hind the terror atrocities of Sept. 11. As President George W. Bush leads an intense international manhunt for Osama, few Americans realize that Osama's eldest brother, Salem, was one of Bush's first business partners.\n \n A photograph from 1971 has surfaced and been printed in English papers showing Osama, age 14, and his brother Salem, age 19, enjoying a summer holiday at the Astoria Hotel in Falun, Sweden. Christina Akerblad, the hotel owner, told the Daily Mail, \"They were beautiful boys, so elegantly dressed. Everybody loved them.\"\n \n Osama embraced Islamic fundamentalism and is now the world's most wanted man. \"Salem went on to become a business partner of the man who is leading the hunt for his brother,\" the Daily Mail's Peter Allen said. \"In the 1970s, he and George W. Bush were founders of the Arbusto Energy oil company in Mr. Bush's home state of Texas.\"\n \n President Bush and the bin Laden family have been connected through dubious business deals since 1977, when Salem, the head of the bin Laden family business, one of the biggest construction companies in the world, invested in Bush's start-up oil company, Arbusto Energy, Inc.\n \n James R. Bath, a friend and neighbor, was used to funnel money from Osama bin Laden's brother, Salem bin Laden, to set up George W. Bush in the oil business, according to The Wall Street Journal and other reputable sources.\n \n Through a tangled web of Saudi multi-millionaires, Texas oilmen, and the infamous Bank of Credit and Commerce International, Bush was financially linked with the bin Laden family until Salem met an untimely end in a freak flying accident near San Antonio in 1988.\n \n The infamous BCCI was shut down in 1991 with some $10 billion in losses.\n \n In June 1977, George W. Bush formed his own oil drilling company, Arbusto Energy, in Midland, Tex. \n \n \"Arbusto\" actually means \"shrub\" in Spanish, but the Bush family interpreted it as \"bush\".\n Salem bin Laden, a close friend of the Saudi King Fahd had \"invested heavily in Bush's first business venture,\" according to The Daily Mail (U.K.).\n \n Arbusto later became Bush Exploration, when Bush's father became vice president. As the company neared financial collapse in September 1984, it was merged with Spectrum 7 Energy Corp. in an effort to stay afloat. \n \n The 50 investors who propped up the Bush company with $4.7 million were \"mainly friends of my uncle\" who \"did pretty good\" in Bush's words, although they lost most of the money they invested in the company. Jon Bush, George's uncle, raised money for Arbusto from political supporters of the Reagan-Bush administration. \n \n \"These were all the Bushs' pals,\" family friend Russell Reynolds told the Dallas Morning News in 1998. \"This is the A-Team.\" \n \n The \"A-Team\" limited partners contributed $4.67 million to various Bush funds through 1984 but got only $1.55 million back in profit distributions, and $3.9 million in tax write-offs. \n \n William DeWitt and Mercer Reynolds, two staunch Reagan-Bush supporters, owned Spectrum 7. \n \n Despite his poor track record, the owners made Bush president of the company and gave him 13.6 percent of the parent company's stock.\n surprise deal\n \n As the hard times continued, Spectrum merged with Harken Energy in 1986. In 1990, Harken received a contract from the government of Bahrain to drill for offshore oil although Harken Energy had never drilled a well overseas or anywhere in water. \n \n \"Knowledgeable oil company sources believe that the Bahrain oil concession was indeed an oblique favor to the president of the United States but say that Saudi Arabia (home of bin Laden) was behind the decision,\" according to The Outlaw Bank: A Wild Ride Into the Secret Heart of the BCCI, by Jonathan Beaty and S.C. Gwynne. \n \n It raised oil-industry eyebrows when the Persian Gulf state announced it had chosen tiny Harken to explore an offshore site for gas and oil. Bahrain officials said they had no idea President Bush's son was associated with Harken, a claim oil-industry sources ridicule. \n The Bahrain deal was brokered in part by Arkansas investment banker David Edwards, one of Bill Clinton's closest friends. The Bahrain oil project resulted in two dry holes and Harken energy abandoned the project.\n \n Two months before Iraq invaded Kuwait, on June 20, 1990, the younger Bush sold two-thirds of his Harken stock, 212,140 shares at $4 a share-for a total of $848,560. \n \"That was $318,430 more than it was worth,\" Dr. Arthur F. Ide, author of George W. Bush: Portrait of a Compassionate Conservative, said. \"George W. broke the law to do this since the transaction was an insider stock sale.\"\n \n Eight days later, Harken finished the second quarter with losses of $23 million and the stock went \"into a nosedive\" losing 75 percent of its value, finishing the year at a little over $1 a share.\n \n \"Like his father who made his fortune in the oil business with the money of others, George W. founded Arbusto with the financial backing of investors, including James R. Bath,\" said the late James Howard Hatfield, author of a \"controversial biography,\" Fortunate Son: George W. Bush and the Mak ing of an American President. \n \n Hatfield, 43, was found dead of an apparent prescription drug overdose in a hotel room in Springdale, Ark. on July 18, 2001. Police declined to investigate.\n \n (More)\n\n \n \n \n \n Thats right its not the crime that counts for your types its simply the accusation.....",

In other words, the enemy is calling somebody and we want to know who they're calling and why\"\n \n That can't be much clearer. People are calling from outside the US, to people here in America. The law doesn't make exceptions just because we know that one person on the phone is a bad guy. Any call that involves someone in the US cannot be tapped without a warrant. As specified by FISA, a warrant is required unless, among other things, \"there is no substantial likelihood that the surveillance will acquire the contents of any communication to which a United States person is a party;\". Obviously a call into the US is likely to involve a US person. Thus, FISA requires warrants for this sort of wiretap. Bush has admitted to authorizing these taps without getting warrants. Bush has admitted to breaking federal law.\n\n \n \n \n You are missing a key word..\n \n \n CITIZEN......",

   "And you're missing, well, an entire argument.\n \n What are you trying to say? Spit it out, don't make me guess.\n\n \n \n \n From the speech:\n \n \n So, consistent with U.S. law and the Constitution, I authorized the interception of international communications of people with known links to al Qaeda and related terrorist organizations. This program is carefully reviewed approximately every 45 days to ensure it is being used properly. Leaders in the United States Congress have been briefed more than a dozen times on this program. And it has been effective in disrupting the enemy, while safeguarding our civil liberties. \n \n This program has targeted those with known links to al Qaeda. I've reauthorized this program more than 30 times since the September the 11th attacks, and I intend to do so for so long as our nation is -- for so long as the nation faces the continuing threat of an enemy that wants to kill American citizens. \n \n \n \n I see NO WHERE WERE IT SAYS US CITIZENS DO YOU?!?!?!?\n \n \n \n Here is some more interesting #### from the speech:\n \n Q It was, why did you skip the basic safeguards of asking courts for permission for the intercepts? \n \n THE PRESIDENT: First of all, I -- right after September the 11th, I knew we were fighting a different kind of war. And so I asked people in my administration to analyze how best for me and our government to do the job people expect us to do, which is to detect and prevent a possible attack. That's what the American people want. We looked at the possible scenarios. And the people responsible for helping us protect and defend came forth with the current program, because it enables us to move faster and quicker. And that's important. We've got to be fast on our feet, quick to detect and prevent. \n \n We use FISA still -- you're referring to the FISA court in your question -- of course, we use FISAs. But FISA is for long-term monitoring. What is needed in order to protect the American people is the ability to move quickly to detect. \n \n Now, having suggested this idea, I then, obviously, went to the question, is it legal to do so? I am -- I swore to uphold the laws. Do I have the legal authority to do this? And the answer is, absolutely. As I mentioned in my remarks, the legal authority is derived from the Constitution, as well as the authorization of force by the United States Congress. \n \n \n \n \n Meat\n \n \n Q -- why, in the four years since 9/11, has your administration not sought to get changes in the law instead of bypassing it, as some of your critics have said? \n \n THE PRESIDENT: I appreciate that. First, I want to make clear to the people listening that this program is limited in nature to those that are known al Qaeda ties and/or affiliates. That's important. So it's a program that's limited, and you brought up something that I want to stress, and that is, is that these calls are not intercepted within the country. They are from outside the country to in the country, or vice versa. So in other words, this is not a -- if you're calling from Houston to L.A., that call is not monitored. And if there was ever any need to monitor, there would be a process to do that. \n \n \n That means COURT ORDER for US citizens\n \n \n \n \n And the potatoes\n \n \n \n Q Thank you, Mr. President. You say you have an obligation to protect us. Then why not monitor those calls between Houston and L.A.? If the threat is so great, and you use the same logic, why not monitor those calls? Americans thought they weren't being spied on in calls overseas -- why not within the country, if the threat is so great? \n \n THE PRESIDENT: We will, under current law, if we have to. We will monitor those calls. And that's why there is a FISA law. We will apply for the right to do so. And there's a difference -- let me finish -- there is a difference between detecting so we can prevent, and monitoring. And it's important to know the distinction between the two. \n \n Q But preventing is one thing, and you said the FISA laws essentially don't work because of the speed in monitoring calls overseas. \n \n THE PRESIDENT: I said we use the FISA courts to monitor calls. It's a very important tool, and we do use it. I just want to make sure we've got all tools at our disposal. This is an enemy which is quick and it's lethal. And sometimes we have to move very, very quickly. But if there is a need, based upon evidence, we will take that evidence to a court, in order to be able to monitor calls within the United States. \n \n \n I think this scandal is now officially......

   "\n I see NO WHERE WERE IT SAYS US CITIZENS DO YOU?!?!?!?\n \n I think this scandal is now officially...... OVER....... emoticon_xgood \n \n \n\n \n I'm sure Bush would like it to be so. And if Bush wanted it to be over all he would have to do is say one simple sentence, one lacking in everything you just quoted. Something along these lines:\n \n 'No US citizen's phones were tapped without a warrant'\n \n If he said that, this would all be over. But he hasn't said it, because it isn't true. Instead he's trying all sorts of dodges to make it look like what he's doing is necessary. One side of the call was from outside the US, we believe that those involved have terrorists links, blah blah blah. None of those things are relevant, there's only one consideration. Were US citizens involved? The NSA said yes, and Bush has all but said it. If it weren't true, than why doesn't he come out and say it? That's the charge leveled against him, that's what FISA's about. Whenever he's been accused of this, his reply has been something along the lines of \"It's necessary\", never \"It's not true\". If you're waiting for him to utter the phrase \"I tapped US citizen's phones\" we'll be in for a long wait, granted. While we're waiting, try to find where he's said \"I haven't tapped US citizen's phones\". Everything Bush has said, everything you cited, sounds like an excuse for why it was ok for him to break the law, none of it is a denial.",
