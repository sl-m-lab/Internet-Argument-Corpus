   "Funny that no one has mentioned 9/11, not one word in this forum. It seems to me that they just don't find it important enough to mention. Or perhaps they are ashamed of the catastrophic consequences for the Iraqis and Afghanis. \n The evil master mind of the invasion of Iraq, the Guant\u00e1namo Gulag and other lesser achievements, Mr Dick Cheney, is proud of his actions. Have you ever seen a former Nazi recant ?\n --------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n The Cheney Legacy \n \n Humiliation can be an overwhelming impulse when 3,000 people die. Humiliation cries out for revenge, for retaliation. But, then, a country like the United States allowed itself to have totalitarian islands within its legal system, such as the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, where torture was practiced. This cannot simply be swept under the rug. This wound, too, is bleeding. Obama will presumably not be able to avoid having criminal charges pressed against some of those found responsible. And, often enough, the chain of command ended with Dick Cheney.\n \n The war on terror was the consequence of 9/11; it shaped America's foreign policy after that point. It is based on the fear that history will repeat itself. But even if dictatorships can be permanently ruled by fear, democracies cannot. Democracies are based on optimism, on the hope that -- despite all the crises -- things will get better. And they're also based on the expectation that measures can be taken to counter threats like terrorism, even if a high risk remains.\n \n True democracies can only be temporarily ruled by fear and humiliation. And they learn from their mistakes. But this is precisely where Cheney has failed. His theory is based on a \"what if\" question looking toward the future. What if, he asks, terrorists attack with the bomb? \n \n But the fact is that every government in every country must take precautions, and then it's up to institutions -- such as the police, customs agents, border guards, the coast guard and, above all, the intelligence agencies -- to enforce these measures. Following the general state of cluelessness that reigned before 9/11, it would have made sense to shake up these government agencies, to reorganize them and to prepare them for all contingencies.\n \n The bureaucratic structures of power are the right place to take the measures that the attacks from eight years ago made necessary. This is where the fear of history's repeating itself should lead to enhanced efficiency -- within the scope of the rule of law.\n \n In his memoirs, Cheney defends his creation. But, in the real world, it has crumbled. We know what began after 9/11. But the real question is, where will it end -- for America, for the world and for Dick Cheney?\n \n Eight Years after 9/11: The Bloody Legacy of Cheney's Failures - SPIEGEL ONLINE - News - International",

   "The racism and latent fascism of the Americans is being watched attentively by the rest of the world from Europe in the northern hemisphere to Australia in the south.\n Unrestrained patriotism of the worst kind, right wing extremism, racism, religious fundamentalism, fear of the stranger in any form, makes America a dangerous beast. The weekend march against Obama showed the racists and fascists to be in top form. Soon they will be advocating to kill the 'boy':\n Margaret Dowd's Op-Ed column described the atmosphere perfectly:\n \n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n The normally nonchalant Barack Obama looked nonplussed, as Nancy Pelosi glowered behind.\n \n Surrounded by middle-aged white guys - a sepia snapshot of the days when such pols ran Washington like their own men's club - Joe Wilson yelled \"You lie!\" at a president who didn't.\n \n But, fair or not, what I heard was an unspoken word in the air: You lie, boy! \n \n The outburst was unexpected from a milquetoast Republican backbencher from South Carolina who had attracted little media attention. Now it has made him an overnight right-wing hero, inspiring \"You lie!\" bumper stickers and T-shirts.\n \n The congressman, we learned, belonged to the Sons of Confederate Veterans, led a 2000 campaign to keep the Confederate flag waving above South Carolina's state Capitol and denounced as a \"smear\" the true claim of a black woman that she was the daughter of Strom Thurmond, the '48 segregationist candidate for president. Wilson clearly did not like being lectured and even rebuked by the brainy black president presiding over the majestic chamber.\n \n I've been loath to admit that the shrieking lunacy of the summer - the frantic efforts to paint our first black president as the Other, a foreigner, socialist, fascist, Marxist, racist, Commie, Nazi; a cad who would snuff old people; a snake who would indoctrinate kids - had much to do with race.\n \n I tended to agree with some Obama advisers that Democratic presidents typically have provoked a frothing response from paranoids - from Father Coughlin against F.D.R. to Joe McCarthy against Truman to the John Birchers against J.F.K. and the vast right-wing conspiracy against Bill Clinton.\n \n But Wilson's shocking disrespect for the office of the president - no Democrat ever shouted \"liar\" at W. when he was hawking a fake case for war in Iraq - convinced me: Some people just can't believe a black man is president and will never accept it.\n \n \"A lot of these outbursts have to do with delegitimizing him as a president,\" said Congressman Jim Clyburn, a senior member of the South Carolina delegation. Clyburn, the man who called out Bill Clinton on his racially tinged attacks on Obama in the primary, pushed Pelosi to pursue a formal resolution chastising Wilson.\n \n \"In South Carolina politics, I learned that the olive branch works very seldom,\" he said. \"You have to come at these things from a position of strength. My father used to say, 'Son, always remember that silence gives consent.' \"\n \n Barry Obama of the post-'60s Hawaiian 'hood did not live through the major racial struggles in American history. Maybe he had a problem relating to his white basketball coach or catching a cab in New York, but he never got beaten up for being black.\n \n Now he's at the center of a period of racial turbulence sparked by his ascension. Even if he and the coterie of white male advisers around him don't choose to openly acknowledge it, this president is the ultimate civil rights figure - a black man whose legitimacy is constantly challenged by a loco fringe. \n \n For two centuries, the South has feared a takeover by blacks or the feds. In Obama, they have both.\n \n The state that fired the first shot of the Civil War has now given us this: Senator Jim DeMint exhorted conservatives to \"break\" the president by upending his health care plan. Rusty DePass, a G.O.P. activist, said that a gorilla that escaped from a zoo was \"just one of Michelle's ancestors.\" Lovelorn Mark Sanford tried to refuse the president's stimulus money. And now Joe Wilson.\n \n \"A good many people in South Carolina really reject the notion that we're part of the union,\" said Don Fowler, the former Democratic Party chief who teaches politics at the University of South Carolina. He observed that when slavery was destroyed by outside forces and segregation was undone by civil rights leaders and Congress, it bred xenophobia.\n \n \"We have a lot of people who really think that the world's against us,\" Fowler said, \"so when things don't happen the way we like them to, we blame outsiders.\" He said a state legislator not long ago tried to pass a bill to nullify any federal legislation with which South Carolinians didn't agree. Shades of John C. Calhoun!\n \n It may be President Obama's very air of elegance and erudition that raises hackles in some. \"My father used to say to me, 'Boy, don't get above your raising,' \" Fowler said. \"Some people are prejudiced anyway, and then they look at his education and mannerisms and get more angry at him.\"\n \n Clyburn had a warning for Obama advisers who want to forgive Wilson, ignore the ignorant outbursts and move on: \"They're going to have to develop ways in this White House to deal with things and not let them fester out there. Otherwise, they'll see numbers moving in the wrong direction.\" \n \n \n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/opinion/13dowd.html?_r=1&em",

   "This year, 9-11 was memorialized with a national call-in day for single payer health care. Why? Read the following and see who didn't get health care after this crisis.\n \n You can still use the phone system they have set up and call in to your representatives if you missed it. Health care for ALL Americans is national security issue, a decency issue, and an issue supported by all true patriots. IMO, only the ignorant, the misled, and the morally bankrupt oppose health care reform. As they themselves keep making so clear with their tea parties.\n \n -----------------\n \n When the towers fell on September 11, 2001, more than 50,000 people responded to the call to action to help with recovery at the World Trade Center. 8 years later, these same heroes feel great betrayal as more are dying from 9/11 related injuries and illnesses without proper health care or financial security.\n \n A recent article in the New York Post cited more than 800 World Trade Center rescue and recovery workers have died since 9/11 -- and cancer has killed at least 270 people (data is still being collected and the number is likely much higher).\n \n 9/11 responders have been plagued with respiratory problems, cancer, financial, and emotional problems, while 90% of 9/11 responders dont have proper medical care.\n \n Responders are still being turned down for benefits, despite the mounting evidence that they were exposed to unsafe conditions during the recovery process.\n \n \"Many responders and their families and friends feel betrayed by Congress and are appalled by the callous indifference, lack of support and meager financial resources provided by the US government,\" says Steve Centore, author of One of Them.\n \n As all Americans who face a health care crisis whether insured or not, the 9/11 responders are at higher risk of foreclosures and bankruptcies.\n \n \"Once we are unable to work, we lose our health care and so does our family thus placing us into catastrophically financial ruin which no one can return from. If the heroes from 9/11 after saving thousands of lives are placed at the bottom of society and left to die, so can any citizen,\" says Reggie Cervantes, 9/11 responder featured in Michael Moores film, SiCKO.\n \n We need to remember those who died and those who are dying as a result of contamination at the World Trade Center. The best way to guarantee immediate help to the 9/11 responders and to ensure that no one is ever faced with such neglect after making great sacrifices for this county is to implement a national single-payer health care system. We are all together in the same boat. It shouldnt take devastation on the magnitude of 9/11 to remind us that the only way a health care system can work is if everybody is in, and nobody is left out.\n \n Please make your call today for single-payer health care reform and say:\n \n 1) Support Congressman Weiners single-payer amendment&#8232;\n 2) Retain Congressman Kucinichs amendment for state single-payer options in HR 3200&#8232;\n 3) Support S. 703\n \n All you have to do is go here, [ Healthcare-NOW! - Medicare for All! ] even if you don't know your Rep. Fill out your address and phone number, you will receive a call script, then you will be connected to your Rep. FREE of charge.\n \n In peace and health,&#8232;Healthcare-NOW!
