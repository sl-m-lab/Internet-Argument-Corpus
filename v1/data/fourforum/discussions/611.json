But I am not talking about pre 9/11, I am talking post 9/11. See my post in \"democrats need to stop the lies\" (Politics forum) and/or the New Republic article \"The 9/10 President\" for more on this.\n \n \nSo he hasn't been the most environmental-friendly president. It doesn't mean that he's decimated the environment.\n \n There's a reason Christy Todf Whitman resigned.\n \n Keep in mind, this is a campaign strategy. Of course it will be exaggerated. Personally, in all truthfulness, I feel\n 1) Bush didn't cause the recession, but he made it worse\n 2) Bush had the right foreign policy ideas, but took the wrong approach getting there.\n 3) Bush messed up the environment, but not as much as the greenies would have you believe\n 4) Bush did ruin HS.
