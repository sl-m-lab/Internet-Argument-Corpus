   "I think it's a given that many posters are tied at the hip to their favorite media sources, in particular TV and talk radio, for opinion formulation and current administration claims to ignore polls. Here's a article where even the WSJ, one of administration's staunchest supporters, suggests elected Republicans will be distancing themselves from the president due to his growing unpopularity:\n \n http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/GI17Aa02.html \n \n The upcoming three years could prove to be one of the longest periods of political dissension in US political history.",
