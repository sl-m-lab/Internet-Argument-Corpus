OK? emoticon_rolleyes\n Stumbling toward Eurabia\n \n 29 April 2008 | 18:08 | FOCUS News Agency\n \n By Alex Alexiev\n \n In the summer of 2004, in an interview little noticed outside the country, the prominent academic scholar of Islam Bassam Tibi predicted a future for Germany that many decried as provocative nonsense at the time. In ten years, Tibi said, Germany will be the scene of large running battles between police and gangs of marginalized Muslim youth, bringing cities like Berlin, Cologne and Frankfurt to the brink of chaos. This will be the inevitable result, according to him, of a trend that is already visible. Muslims are not interested in integration. They are, in fact, obligated not to integrate by the radical Islamic ideology dominant in their communities, and live increasingly segregated in parallel societies. The main difference between 2004 and 2014, Tibi believed, would be that the highly marginalized Muslim population would have more than doubled to 10 million, sharia would have been gradually introduced in Germany and the Islam preached there would be even more radical and resemble Nazi totalitarianism.\n Today, more than three and a half years later, a new study of attitudes among young Muslims by the German interior ministry would seem to confirm Tibi's fears. According to the survey, 44 percent of respondents have fundamentalist Islamic beliefs, 50 percent believe that \"Muslims who die in the armed struggle for the faith (Jihad) go to paradise,\" and one in four is ready to engage in violence against non-Muslims.\n Nor is such troubling evidence unique to Germany. At about the time the German study was being released, the Bishop of Rochester, Michael Nazir-Ali, spoke of the existence of Muslim no-go zones in Britain, described as areas dominated by radical Islamic ideology where people of different faiths reportedly face physical attacks. This phenomenon has been likened by Tory shadow Home Secretary David Davis to \"voluntary apartheid\" by Muslims, \"shutting themselves in closed society, demanding immunity from criticism.\" And just a month earlier, in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, young Muslim rioters for the first time used firearms and Molotov cocktails to battle police in what was described by some in the media as an \"urban guerilla war.\"\n Are these troubling developments part of an inexorable slide toward the Islamization of Europe that will make Tibi's dire predictions reality? Or are they, as many have argued, the predictable result of the long-term socio-economic neglect, racism and discrimination against Europe's Muslims that could be easily fixed with the proper policies? The answer to this question is of existential importance for the future of Europe, the Atlantic Alliance and, indeed, Western civilization itself.\n \n The demographics of twilight\n \n The crisis now engulfing Europe is euphemistically referred to in scholarly papers as the \"second demographic transition.\" What this innocuous term conceals is a phenomenon unprecedented in human history, namely the implicit refusal of large societies in times of peace to produce babies in numbers sufficient to guarantee their long-term survival.\n While this trend seems to characterize the entire developed industrial world to one extent or another, it is especially pronounced in Europe, where it has become a continent-wide phenomenon. Stated simply, European birth rates (known as \"total fertility rate,\" or TFR) have collapsed to approximately 1.5 children per woman in 1995 from nearly twice that rate three decades earlier.6 What this means, in practical terms, is that a sustained fertility rate of 1.5 in a society leads to the yearly loss of one-half percent of its population. The cataclysmic long-term repercussions of such a development in Europe may be too far in the future to worry us here, but there are immediate and medium-term consequences to this phenomenon that should be of grave concern.\n With a fertility rate of just under 1.5 percent for the past ten years, and no realistic prospect of any improvement in the foreseeable future, Europe has an annual deficit of over two million births to reach replacement levels. To the extent that the continent's population is increasing at all, it is mostly on account of legal and illegal immigration. As the smaller post-baby boom cohorts reach childbearing age, this deficit will widen still further, contracting the native European population by anywhere between 100 and 150 million-or a quarter to a third of today's EU-25 450 million-by mid-century. This historically unprecedented population implosion will shrink Europe's share of the world population to barely four percent in 2050 from 12 percent in 1950.\n Unfortunately, the dire implications of this trend will not wait until mid-century to manifest themselves, but will start wreaking havoc with Europe's socio-economic prospects in the immediate future. This is because, long before significant depopulation begins to take place, low fertility ushers in a pervasive ageing process that ultimately renders the expensive but unfunded pay-as-you-go welfare systems of modern western societies unsustainable. Demographers refer to this key dependency as the \"potential support ratio\" (PSR), usually expressed in the ratio of individuals of working age (15-64) to the number of people of retirement age (65 and over) in a given society. A more accurate measure is the actual number of working individuals available to support each retired or disabled individual through their taxes.\n Until the late decades of the 20th century, these ratios were traditionally very high even in western societies, where the average age of the population remained under 30. But this is changing dramatically. By 2010, the number of elders (65 and over) in France and most other EU countries will outnumber people aged 0 to 14-a development that has never happened before in recorded history. By 2015, the 60-and-over cohort will represent more than a quarter of the population, and a decade or so later it will become twice as large as the group aged 0 to 24. It is beyond question that with a projected nominal PSR of between 1.5 and 2 in 2030 and even earlier none of the EU countries would be able to sustain levels of prosperity anywhere near the ones they enjoy today unless their welfare systems are drastically reformed or dismantled.FOCUS Information Agency",

Here's one very applicable prophecy which speaks to this generation.\n Mat 24:3 As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, \"Tell us, when will these things happen, and what {will be} the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?\"\n Mat 24:4 And Jesus answered and said to them, \"See to it that no one misleads you.\n Mat 24:5 \"For many will come in My name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will mislead many.\n Mat 24:6 \"You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not frightened, for {those things} must take place, but {that} is not yet the end.\n Mat 24:7 \"For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and in various places there will be famines and earthquakes.\n Mat 24:8 \"But all these things are {merely} the beginning of birth pangs.\n Mat 24:9 \"Then they will deliver you to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name.\n Mat 24:10 \"At that time many will fall away and will betray one another and hate one another.\n Mat 24:11 \"Many false prophets will arise and will mislead many. \n Mat 24:12 \"Because lawlessness is increased, most people's love will grow cold.\n Mat 24:13 \"But the one who endures to the end, he will be saved.\n Mat 24:14 \"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.\n Mat 24:15 \"Therefore when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),\n Mat 24:16 then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains.\n Mat 24:17 \"Whoever is on the housetop must not go down to get the things out that are in his house.\n Mat 24:18 \"Whoever is in the field must not turn back to get his cloak.\n Mat 24:19 \"But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!\n Mat 24:20 \"But pray that your flight will not be in the winter, or on a Sabbath.\n Mat 24:21 \"For then there will be a great tribulation, such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will.\n Mat 24:22 \"Unless those days had been cut short, no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short.\n Mat 24:23 \"Then if anyone says to you, 'Behold, here is the Christ,' or 'There {He is,}' do not believe {him.}\n Mat 24:24 \"For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect.\n Mat 24:25 \"Behold, I have told you in advance.\n Mat 24:26 \"So if they say to you, 'Behold, He is in the wilderness,' \n do not go out, {or,} 'Behold, He is in the inner rooms,' do not believe {them.Mat 24:27 \"For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes even to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.\n Mat 24:28 \"Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.\n Mat 24:29 \"But immediately after the tribulation of those days THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL FALL from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.\n Mat 24:30 \"And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the SON OF MAN COMING ON THE CLOUDS OF THE SKY with power and great glory.\n Mat 24:31 \"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n Mat 24:32 \"Now learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near;\n Mat 24:33 so, you too, when you see all these things, recognize that He is near, {right} at the door.\n Mat 24:34 \"Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.\n Mat 24:35 \"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.\n Mat 24:36 \"But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.\n Mat 24:37 \"For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days of Noah.\n Mat 24:38 \"For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark,\n Mat 24:39 and they did not understand until the flood came and took them all away; so will the coming of the Son of Man be.\n Mat 24:40 \"Then there will be two men in the field; one will be taken and one will be left.\n Mat 24:41 \"Two women {will be} grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one will be left.\n Mat 24:42 \"Therefore be on the alert, for you do not know which day your Lord is coming.\n Mat 24:43 \"But be sure of this, that if the head of the house had known at what time of the night the thief was coming, he would have been on the alert and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.\n Mat 24:44 \"For this reason you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not think {He will.}\n \nAs far as the Muslims becoming the dominant religion in America I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing, they can't be much worse then you guys.\n\n \n Right, this problem of christian gangs going around and beheading anyone who rejects Christ is the scourge of this generation, isn't it. That belief that murdering any and all who refuse to submit to worship Yawheh makes followers of Christ a larger threat to freedom than islam ever represented. emoticon_rolleyes Oh wait, christians only pray for those whom they perceive to be lost and in need of salvation.
