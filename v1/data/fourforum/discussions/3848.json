   "10 Reasons the US has Lost the War in Iraq\n \n by Brendan Shea\n \n \n 1) 100,000 dead Iraqis\n \n A stomach-churning study by the Lancet medical journal released in late October concluded that 100,000 Iraqi civilians have died since the US invaded Iraq in March, 2003.\n \n \n 2) Iraqis view US as Occupiers\n \n Last April, 3,500 Iraqis from all of Iraq's ethnic groups were polled on whether they viewed US forces as occupiers or liberators. 71% said the US is an occupying force (81% if the Kurds are discounted). The poll was conducted before Abu Ghraib and before the US slaughtered 600+ civilians in Fallujah in April, 2003.\n \n \n 3) High-Profile Murders\n \n The latest atrocity at the hands of US forces in Iraq is the cold-blooded murder of an unarmed, wounded \"insurgent\" in a Fallujah mosque. If Muslims are offended by people failing to take their shoes off in a mosque, then I'm guessing brain matter and skull fragments might be a tad more objectionable.\n \n \n 4) Saddam Planned for Guerrilla War\n \n \"Had we to do it over again, we would look at the consequences of catastrophic success - being so successful, so fast, that an enemy that should have surrendered or been done in, escaped and lived to fight another day.\"-George W. Bush.\n \n Saddam understood this, which is why in July, 2002 he sent out a memo to his Baath Party officials that said \"Iraq will be defeated militarily due to the imbalance in forces.\" Thus the only way to fight the US, Saddam concluded, would be by \"dragging the US military into Iraqi cities, villages and the desert and resorting to resistance tactics.\"\n \n \n 5) Abu Ghraib\n \n The event that will haunt America for at least a generation. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was wrong when he said that the invasion of Iraq would \"create 100 bin Ladens.\" In the aftermath of Abu Ghraib, perhaps he should've said \"1,000,000 bin Ladens.\"\n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article7348.htm\n \n \n Video Puts the Hunt for Weapons of Mass Destruction in a Different Perspective:\n \n http://video.buzzflash.com/04/10/Bushs_Big_Joke.wmv\n \n \n Related Threads:\n \n Top 10 Lessons from Gulf War II\n \n Bush Admin's Lies, Treason Documented in Online Video\n \n Interventionism: Suicide for the American Republic\n \n \n \n .",

   "I read an article this morning about eight military personnel who are suing the government for extending their enlistments, claiming a violation of their enlistment contracts .... it will be interesting to see how that plays out. 60 Minutes had a segment on reservists being recalled to duty, not \"Ready\" reservists that meet, train and are assigned to a unit, but standby reservists who have not worn a uniform in decades. Also, officers who served their time and were discharged are being called back because they did not resign their commissions ... something they claim they weren't told they had to do. Seems to me that the term \"All Volunteer Army\" should be changed to \"Volunteers and a whole bunch that just want out\". I received my discharge from the Marines Reserves in 1955, from the Army in 1957, from the Army Reserves in 1965 .... will my recall be in today's mail? Another article this morning, \"Rumsfield predicts Iraq exit in 4 years\" is bad news for reservests serving on their second extension .... as they wait for an additional 30,000 to arrive. What are the chances the President will put on his flight suit, have himself flown out to the carrier Abraham Lincoln, and personally take down that banner that reads \"MISSION ACCOMPLISHED\"?\n Dono\n Dono",

Volunteer cannon fodder will hopefully take notice of the ruling. In almost any other civil case, non-disclosure would have won the case if that clause had not been specifically reviewed with the enlistee when the contract was signed. At War covers a lot of ground for federal litigators.\n \n Bush's handlers have been very careful to explain that the 'Mission Accomplished' bravado referred only to the invasion.",
