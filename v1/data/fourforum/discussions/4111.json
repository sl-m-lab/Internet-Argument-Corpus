More on that later, but in the meanwhile the only thing that really matters is the law. gays will have or not have gay marriage based on the law. All of these other debates are cute, but I am not sure they matter. The constitution does. Both state and federal. How law is and how it is applied will determine what will be eventually.

Not once did I see the word \"marriage\" or any derivative of it. On that basis,\n \n \n Amendment IX \n The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. \n\n \n Seems to say to me that just because the Constitution outlines certain specific rights, it doesn't deny other rights not specifically stated in the Constitution, to the people; in this case, the right of individuals to marry and any rights obtained through marriage, same-sex or opposite-sex.\n \n Further,\n \n \n Amendment X \n The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. \n\n \n Seems to say that if the power is not specifically granted to the federal government by the Constitution, or specifically denied to states by the Constitution, those power are given to the states. If the power is not exercised by the state, then that power falls to the people. Since the Constitution does not specifically bar same-sex marriage, the states must specifically bar it, or it is a right of the people. Some state have specifically barred same-sex marriage, therefore such a ban is legal, within those particular states. In states where it is not barred, it \"should\" be legal.\n \n Moving onward,\n \n \n Amendment XIV. \n Section. 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n \n \n Is same-sex marriage a \"liberty\" ? Unless it is specifically denied to be a liberty by law within the given state, then I would argue that it is. This would depend on each individual state's constitution and laws.\n \n As I see it, there is nothing in the U. S. Constitution that says it is illegal, so therefore, it should be legal now, except in those states where it is legally (????) barred.",

I'm not sure these four years can go fast enough. Hopefully gay folks will still be around when this oaf is done.\n\n \n \n Have no fear there. We aren't all defecting to Canada. Some of us believe so fervently in our country we are willing to sacrifice our momentary discomfort towards a greater good. \n Speaking for myself, I intend to stay here, in the land where I was born, for which I swore on oath to protect this nation, and believe in the ongoing experiment called Democracy. Four years/ or in this case eight years, is but a small price to pay in the fight for civil equality for future generations. \n \n {OH btw, dubya isn't really an oaf, he's just a turd...the real oaf is Dennis \"Do-Nothing\" {B}-Hasteret. Speaker of the House, the guy with no oppinion of his own, who ALWAYS votes \"Speaker\" but is the perfect \"YES-MAN\" to his Prez.}\n Dubya is simply a puppet, B/Hastert is the Oaf.",
