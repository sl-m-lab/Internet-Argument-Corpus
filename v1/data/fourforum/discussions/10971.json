I must also add that satans greatest trick in defeating people is to get them to believe he doesn't even exist in reality. It's impossible to stand against, or defeat an enemy one doesn't even believe exists.\n \n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu6pTIfVHgBsAXZlXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTBzdTNjcXU5BHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMTAEY29sbwNhYzIEdnRpZAM-/SIG=11vsiigfu/EXP=1207333587/**http%3a//www.bible.org/page.php%3fpage_id=388\n \n The Doctrine of Satan\n \n I. The Existence of Satan\n \n A. Seven Old Testament books and every New Testament writer refer to Satan.\n \n B. Jesus referred to Satan (Matt.13:39; Luke 10:18; 11:18).\n \n II. The Personality and Names of Satan\n \n A. Personality &#8211; He has intellect (2 Cor.11:3), emotions (Rev.12:17) and will (2 Tim.2:26.\n \n B. Names &#8211; He is called Satan, the Devil (slanderer), Lucifer (son of the morning), Beelzebub (Lord of the flies &#8211; Matt.12:24), and Belial (lawless &#8211; 2 Cor.6:15), the evil one (1 John 5:19), the tempter (1 Thess.3:5), the prince of this world (John 12:31), the god of this age (2 Cor.4:4), the prince of the power of the air (Eph.2:2), the accuser of the brethren (Rev.12:10), and angel of light (false light &#8211; 2 Cor.11:14), a serpent (Rev.12:9), and a dragon (Rev.12:3).\n \n III. The Nature of Satan\n \n A. He is a created angelic being. He was created as part of the angelic realm (Eph.6:11,12; Ezek.24:18) and was the highest in rank of them all (Ezek.28:12-14).\n \n B. He is an enemy of righteousness. He is a murderer (John 8:44), a liar (John 8:44), and accuser (Rev.12:10) and our adversary (1 Pet.5:8).\n \n C. He is a limited creature. He is limited by God (Job.1:12). He is not God&#8217;s equal (1 John 4:4). He is not omniscient, omnipotent or infinite in any way. Believers with God&#8217;s help can resist him (James 4:7).\n \n IV. The Fall of Satan\n \n Key Passages &#8211; Ezekiel 28; Isaiah 14\n A. Ezekiel 28:11-19 is a prophetic lamentation over the &#8220;King of Tyre&#8221; who is described in language that fits Satan&#8217;s fall and not a mere human king. Satan is distinguished form the human ruler of Tyre in 28:2 (&#8220;prince/ruler&#8221;) and called a &#8220;king&#8221; in 28:12 (Not even Israel&#8217;s rulers were called &#8220;King&#8221;). Though Tyre had a human &#8220;ruler&#8221;, Satan was the real &#8220;King&#8221; behind that wicked kingdom.\n \n B. His attributes &#8211; Moral perfection (v.12) Sinless at his creation until his fall (v.15)\n \n C. His appearance &#8211; Perfect in beauty (v.12b,13)\n \n 1. His privileges &#8211; Free access to the garden of Eden (v.12) and to God&#8217;s holy mountain (= God&#8217;s presence &#8211; v.14)\n \n 2. His rank &#8211; &#8220;Cherub&#8221; (vs.14,16)\n \n 3. His judgment &#8211;\n \n a. Cast out of the mountain of God (v.16, cf. Rev12:4)\n \n b. Cast to the ground (v.17)\n \n c. Consumed by fire (v.18, cf. Rev.20:10)\n \n D. Isaiah 14:12-15 also seems to describe Satan&#8217;s fall. Satan is manifest here by the king of Babylon. As in Ezekiel 28, Satan is pictured here as the real &#8220;king&#8221; behind the wicked human kingdom of Babylon.\n \n 1. The imagery of a &#8220;star&#8221; and &#8220;falling from heaven&#8221; (v.12) suggests a supernatural fulfillment. &#8220;Stars&#8221; (v.12,13) are symbolic of the angelic realm elsewhere (Job 38:6,7; Rev.12:4).\n \n 2. The five &#8220;I will&#8217;s&#8221; of vss. 13 & 14 are literally true of Satan and only metaphorically true of Babylon&#8217;s king. This ultimate form of pride (&#8220;I will be like the Most High&#8221; &#8211; v.14) fits the New Testament description of Satan&#8217;s fall 1 Tim.3:6.\n \n V. The Activity of Satan\n \n Satan is seeking to oppose God&#8217;s plan by promoting evil in every way possible.\n \n A. Indirect Activity &#8211; He works indirectly through the world (in which he has great freedom and power &#8211; John 12:31; 1 John 5:19) and the flesh (Gal.5:19-21). The world, the flesh and the devil are not three separate enemies of the Christian. Rather Satan works through the evil world system (1 John 2:13-15) to exploit the fleshly nature that still wars within us (Rom.7:18; Gal.5:19-21).\n \n \n \n Diagram: Norm Geisler\n \n B. Direct Activity &#8211; He works directly by deception, temptation, attack and possession.\n \n 1. In Christ&#8217;s ministry\n \n a. He tempted Christ (Matt.4:1-11).\n \n b. He attempted to thwart Christ&#8217;s work (John 8:44; Matt.16:23; Luke 22:31).\n \n c. He possessed Judas to accomplish the betrayal (John 13:27).\n \n 2. In unbelievers\n \n a. He blinds their minds to hinder their understanding of the gospel (2 Cor.4:4).\n \n b. When the gospel is heard or understood, he tries to hinder its effect (Luke 8:12).\n \n c. He uses persecution (Rev.2:10) and false religions (Rev.2:13) to hinder the effect of the gospel.\n \n 3. In believers\n \n a. He tempts believers (to pride &#8211; 1 Chron.21:1-8; to materialism &#8211; John 2:15; James 5:1-7; to immorality &#8211; 1 Cor.7:5; to lie &#8211; Acts 5:3; to discouragement &#8211; 1 Pet.5:6-10; to be unforgiving &#8211; 2 Cor.2:10,11 etc.).\n \n b. He hinders the ministries of believers (1 Thess.2:18; Rev.2:10).\n \n c. He promotes false teaching among believers (1 John 4:1-4).\n \n d. He promotes anger, bitterness and division (Eph.4:26,27; 2 Cor.2:5-11). Note: See the supplement &#8211; &#8220;Satanic Activity and Spiritual Warfare&#8221; for more information on how Satan and his demons work and how we must respond.",

Ever since then we have been in a spiritual battle against this creature. Although he has many powers we don't have, he is limited by God of what he is able to do to us. The link I posted explains all of your questions regarding what satan can and can't do in tempting mankind.\n \n Eph 6:10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might.\n Eph 6:11 Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.\n Eph 6:12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual {forces} of wickedness in the heavenly {places.}\n\n I do understand that your belief comes from scripture. However, do you never look at our experienced world and do any direct analysis? That was what I was getting at with my questions, which I will repeat below:\n \n 1) Can you give examples of evil acts that we know of in our history in which Satan had to have played a role. (Examples might include the Holocaust, specific wars, etc.)\n \n 2) Do you think that all evil acts are influenced by Satan? \n \n 3) What role do you think is played by men's weaknesses? \n \n 4) Do you think that weak people lack the imagination to think up cruel acts and that it is only Satan that can inspire them to those deeds?\n \n Even given your belief, you should be able to answer these questions in a way that is consistent with your beliefs. I am mainly curious how your belief interprets our observed reality. After all, if the words of scripture are true, then they should have a direct applicability to the world we all experience today - not just to the ancient stories of the Bible.",

(Examples might include the Holocaust, specific wars, etc.)\n \n I can think of many examples of satanic influence on World events and on personal human sins. But it is impossible to prove their source so discussing them is pointless as nobody here would believe it anyway. suffice it to say, he is very active in shaping World events and as the prince of the air also has power over weather and the natural World.\n \n 2) Do you think that all evil acts are influenced by Satan? \n \n Most definitely, but not exclusively. It isn't as though Man plays no part in our own rebellion against God. \n \n 3) What role do you think is played by men's weaknesses? \n \n The natural man has absolutely no defenses against the wiles of the devil. They are nothing more than ignorant pawns to be picked off in the War against God. It's like fighting a war and a large part of the population is caught sleeping by the enemy and killed without ever knowing they were in a battle for their lives. Such is the outcome for the Natural Man in this spiritual battle humanity is in with the demonic forces which seek to destroy us all. \n \n 4) Do you think that weak people lack the imagination to think up cruel acts and that it is only Satan that can inspire them to those deeds?\n \n History has shown that there is no end to the limits of mans ability to think up cruel acts. But whether mans heart and soul could naturally be so dark and corrupted as to do some of the atrocities that have been documented is another question altogether. Sin is a cancer that eats away at the unsaved mans soul, and the result of those sins is the carnage it leaves behind, and satan plays as big a part in tempting that person as he is allowed to play by that person who has no defenses against him at all.

You've since shown that you have no interest in logic, so I just have fun beating you to a pulp with the Truth Stick of No Mercy\u0099.\n \n \nYou see, spiritual insight isn't something people just know about, it's a quality one either has or doesn't have. And you don't have it or you would understand the nature of God and what He did to redeem humanity.\n\n I love this. You have to be a cult member in order to want to be a cult member. Outsiders just don't understand... It's like saying, \"You have to drink the poisoned kool-aid if you want to know why you should drink the poisoned kool-aid, but if you don't know why you should drink the poisoned kool-aid, you're a closed-minded jackass; if I can't defend my position based on the rules of logic, it must be because logic is wrong!\"\n \n More importantly, why didn't you address anything from my more recent post instead of quoting an older one?\n \n \nAny spiritual insights I have come from the Holy Spirit which indwells me and not of myself at all.\n\n Which is essentially the same thing many of the people locked up in your local loony bin and those pleading insanity say, too.\n \n \nBut what I do know for certain based on what he believes in and say's is that electrolyte is no deeper than a puddle of dirty sludge in a grease pit. And that's a fact jack.\n\n Oh, look, an insulting assertion. Care to back up this assertion? I mean, you stated it in no uncertain terms, yet you show no reasoning or argumentation. Par for the Archie course.\n On the other hand, why make the argument that the person who repeatedly beats your XXX senseless on these forums is so shallow? What does that say about you?\n \n \nWhat is arrogant is that a finite being like lyte and these other atheists, claim to speak of, and define eternal subjects which they have no real understanding of. That is the epitome of arrogance.\n\n But you say the same things about the Flying Spaghetti Monster. How dare you?! You clearly don't understand the wonder of His Noodly Appendage. What arrogance! emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Archie, a few tips.\n \n 1) It's ridiculous to try to give proclamations on \"truth\" when you can't even be trusted to accept simple definitions of words.\n When you try to add to or redefine words, you lose all hope of being able to maintain a \"truth\" claim.\n \n 2) Your BELIEF does not equate to \"truth\".\n Other people who have competing beliefs are not \"ignorant\" because they do not share your BELIEFS.\n It would be helpful if you would stop trying to insert words like \"truth\" or \"ignorant\" in your responses when we are talking about your PERSONAL BELIEFS which you have no real independent evidence for.\n \n 3) The whole stance of \"you can't understand unless you believe\" is absurd. It's an attempt to beg the question by assuming the answer is true before you even can approach the question.\n I don't understand why you continue with that approach, and how you can't see that it is inherently doomed to fail.\n If that scenario (\"you can't understand unless you believe\") is real, then HOW is it possible to convert anybody to the belief in the first place? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n 4) Your arguments are not difficult to understand. \n I repeat, your arguments are not difficult to understand.\n They are difficult to accept as credible or worthy of belief.\n \n I think the real problem here is that you either cannot comprehend or refuse to address the problems others have with your statements.\n Smiley's question is excellent for getting at the heart of why some of us are having problems with your \"free will\" approach.\n Smiley: \"Do you not agree that the ability to be forgiven is in fact grace rather than free will?\"\n \n If you had any real interest in \"converting\" anybody, you would do well to honestly and openly address that question.",
