   "\"Being in a serious relationship is not enough to protect young gay men from infection with HIV, new research suggests.\n \n In fact, a study by researchers at Northwestern University found that young gay couples are six times more likely to have unprotected sex than casual partners.\n \n The researchers noted that gay men account for nearly 70 percent of all new HIV/AIDS diagnoses among adolescents and young adults in the United States. A recent study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also found that the majority of new HIV infections occur within committed relationships.\"\n\n More at For Gay Men, Serious Relationships Still Harbor Risks for HIV - Yahoo!
