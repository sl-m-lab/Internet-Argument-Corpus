   "Abortion can be very wrong in some cases. But what about the case of rape? Should it be allowed. In my opinion I think that it is a necessary evil. As long as its in the earliest stages, but if the person is against it, but doesnt wanna keep the kid at leas give the child up for adoption. This subject has crossed my mind on many occasions, but I havent had a chance to voice my opinion until I came to this site.

Truly told, you want the fetus to have greater importance than the woman. The woman's rights are immaterial to you in comparison to the fetus' rights.\n \n Which do you support, the fetus' right to the woman's body or the woman's right to her own body? The answer is which you think is more important in the pregnancy relationship. They cannot be equal, because in the pregnancy relationship the woman's rights are in constant conflict with the fetus' (currently non-existant) right to use her body to live.\n \n \n\n ....I believe it is a life which is whole point. But once I believe that it is a life...then a women not wanting her body resources used becomes irrelevant because there is no greater devalueing then killing someone.\n\n \n Yes there is. A patriot once said: Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!\n \n Freedom and personal choice are the cornerstone of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Whatever you believe is happening to the fetus, you are visiting tenfold upon the woman because she is concious of what is happening to her and you know she is a citizen, a person and is deserving of rights. To denigrate her and make her less important than what is growing inside her, which, I remind you, does not have a brain at the stage many abortions are done, is incredibly insensitive and a horrible perversion of the \"respect for life\" that pro-life people spout. True respect would not force the woman to give birth against her will.\n \n \n\n I take it you thought I was only referring to women...no, I was talking about depression and things like that....I think they are **** reasons to have an abortion, lay off of work, get outta class...this applies to anyone.

Where is your responsibility in all of this? Didn't YOU chose to marry him? Didn't YOU have a baby with him? Or did he rape you and force you to conceive? You're all fired up against men who respect motherhood and women who chose to be mothers. Don't you see something wrong with that picture? \n You continuously use rape as a justification for abortion despite knowing that rape victims rarely become pregnant as a result of being attacked. I've cited the statistics to you before.\n You say that the woman has friends, family, job, education, etc., but none of these are justification for taking a life, IMO. They are all just excuses, false justification for committing a heinous act upon an innocent. here are some stats for you to consider:\n \n\n 60% of abortions are performed on women who already have one or more children.\n 47% of abortions are performed on women who have already had one or more abortions.\n 43% of women will have had at least one abortion by the time they are 45 years old.\n \n Abortion Statistics - Decisions to Have an Abortion (U.S.)\n 25.5% of women deciding to have an abortion want to postpone childbearing.\n 21.3% of women cannot afford a baby.\n 14.1% of women have a relationship issue or their partner does not want a child.\n 12.2% of women are too young (their parents or others object to the pregnancy.)\n 10.8% of women feel a child will disrupt their education or career.\n 7.9% of women want no (more) children.\n 3.3% of women have an abortion due to a risk to fetal health.\n 2.8% of women have an abortion due to a risk to maternal health.\n http://womensissues.about.com/cs/abortionstats/a/aaabortionstats.htm\n \n\n \n Now, from the above statistics, only 6% of abortions have possible medical reasons, the remaining 94% of US abortions can be summed up with one word \"SELFISHNESS\".

   "If you truly believed that, then the fetus would still have no right to live off the woman against her will and without her consent. Truly told, you want the fetus to have greater importance than the woman. The woman's rights are immaterial to you in comparison to the fetus' rights.\n \n Which do you support, the fetus' right to the woman's body or the woman's right to her own body? The answer is which you think is more important in the pregnancy relationship. They cannot be equal, because in the pregnancy relationship the woman's rights are in constant conflict with the fetus' (currently non-existant) right to use her body to live. \n\n \n What? I support the fetus' (human life) right to live. Even if you claim that a women has her right to her own body the kid still has a right to life. I believe that one can't deny this right. If you you deny that right and grant your so called right to her own body then you still make it unequal. So who do you go with? Well, why would the right to live be under what someone wants to do with his/her own body.\n \n \n \n\n Yes there is. A patriot once said: Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!\n \n Freedom and personal choice are the cornerstone of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Whatever you believe is happening to the fetus, you are visiting tenfold upon the woman because she is concious of what is happening to her and you know she is a citizen, a person and is deserving of rights. To denigrate her and make her less important than what is growing inside her, which, I remind you, does not have a brain at the stage many abortions are done, is incredibly insensitive and a horrible perversion of the \"respect for life\" that pro-life people spout. True respect would not force the woman to give birth against her will.\n \n \n \n Are you one of those pricks who refuse to believe post-partum depression exists? Hormonal imbalances cause very real mood disturbances, and this is what clinical depression is all about. To force a woman who has clinical depression to give birth and have a child when even the most stable women has moderate to severe emotional turmoil... I have no words. I have seen so few pro-life people show any consideration for the women they so casually disregard, and you are no different.\n\n \n Way to misrepresent that quote....The thought was there, if you don't value him as a human being to give him liberty then he is just as good as dead.\n \n As for the depression thing...I didn't say anything about post-partum depression. I am saying that depression is overdone today. My dad is a pyschologist and can testify to this. Unless we have other Doctors here I don't think they would trump the credibility of a psychologist.

This is much more than depression that you or I think of. Someone of clinical depression would most likely need SSRIs in order to be ok, however, some therapy could work too. This makes up around 10% (or so) of the amount of SSRIs that are being used today for depression. Take some studies that my dad has done.... He found that people on the Prozac pill would get better from \"depression\" some 70% of them, but at the same time the people on the sugar pill that had \"depression\" would get better 60% of the time. My dad has also stated that in the past 10 years he went from seeing 1 outta every 10 or so patients would be on an SSRI...now it is odd to see them without one. The point is, most depression is normal. If you are depressed over 1yr, then you might wanna get some help. Don't for a minute though think depression is like Autism or something like that....those are mental illnesses.

First, the fetus is not a recognized individual (indeed not an individual at all) and second the fetus' right to live ends where it interferes with the woman's rights.\n\n Not true. Many states, including California, have fetal right laws. Scott Peterson was convicted of killing Laci's fetus in addition to killing Laci.\n \n\n You ask So who do you go with? The woman is the most important participant in the pregnancy relationship. Any conflict in rights are resolved in her favor. Always.\n\n Again, not true. In order to have a late-term abortion, for example, there has to be a medical justification to kill the fetus. The whims of the pregnant woman don't cut it.\n \n\n No, the thought was that he would rather be dead than have his rights taken away. There are worse things than death, and stripping one of their rights is one of those things.\n\n You are correct in your interpretation, but not in its applicability to abortion.\n \n\n Perhaps depression is over done, and perhaps not. That does not change the fact that emotional issues are very real and very important for a pregnant woman, sometimes more important than physical issues. To trivialize them as you are doing shows little compassion and denegrates women in general and mothers in particular\n\n IMO, claiming that an abortion is justifiable for \"emotional well-being\" reasons is a farce.

Cutting the ambilical cord takes an overt action on your part nd can actually get you arrested for murder.\n\n \n I agree it is not a passive \"inaction\", just as me removing your teeth from my neck if you were sucking my blood to live is not a passive act. Preventing would be a passive act. Once it is already there you should still be able to withdraw (an active act) support you do not want to be a part of.\n \n \n\n Agreed. It is an incremental attempt to reverse Roe v Wade. And you're right about presidents and Congress (I'd add the SCOTUS in the mix too) being able to make laws that were unconstitutional. Just look at all of the anti-Second Amendment Laws. emoticon_mad \n\n \n Except that SCOTUS determines what is Constitutional or not (even if we the citizens don't agree with it).

Of course, if one party, or ideaology, controls all three we're pretty much screwed.\n \n \n\n Equating not being able to have an abortion and life under the tyranny of King George III isn't exactly equivalent, IMO. \n\n \n No, but the concept of life without rights being worse than death is.\n \n \n\n I didn't say that it didn't happen. I've been \"up close and personal\" to postpartum depression. That's why I said it wasn't life-threatening.\n\n \n However, each case of postpartum is different and each woman can handle different levels of stress. I agree that it by itself isn't life-threatening, but certainly severe cases can have a woman being suicidal.\n \n \n\n What we're disputing is the gravity of the depression, not it's existence.\n\n \n Ah, well Steve thinks they're BS.

However I do feel that emotional issues, especially during a period when a woman's hormones are extremely out of wack, should be given serious consideration.\n \n \n\n Hum...that was my argument AGAINST abortion. emoticon_cry \n I don't think it should be eliminated, just tightened up considerably to remove the big loophole.\n\n \n Tightened up in what manner? A woman's health is damaged simply by being pregnant. Any 'tightening up' would then start the politicians deciding whether a woman's pregnancy is difficult or not.
