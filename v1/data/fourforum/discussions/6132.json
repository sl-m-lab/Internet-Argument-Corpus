   "i see your point...does this mean america is doom in its intellectual development as a nation and country?\n\n \n Post WW2 US, and Europe, went through the most prosperous economic cycle in history. Prior to that cycle education (and public money) through 12th grade level (US) was concentrated on providing a rounded, useful curriculum for students with a much smaller percentage being university bound. It was not uncommon for students to be held back a grade, or two, until dropping out or fulfilling standards. There were two levels, college prep and general education. Little public money was available for higher education and generally limited to scholastically superior individuals. \n \n As the middle class expanded its ranks, equality and perceived opportunity became a well-used political governing tool offering expanded education at public expense. Without delving too deeply into that, college became available to almost anyone with the desire. Public costs became substantial as the inefficent federal government began footing the bill for college educations and lower education, which allowed political control over textbooks, standards, etc. Churn 'em out mentality quickly followed to where college grads without a a recognized profession in a vary narrow band (public service demand aside) were standing in line at service companies. Soon fast food servers will have MBAs. \n \n Will the US swing back to a two-tiered society including education? The politician who cuts school funding is dead meat in the voter market. While I believe the economy and shrinking middle-class is forcing us into a division of haves and have-nots, I don't forsee any reduction in public funding for education. Political sense says that age group needs to be occupied rather than looking for scarce jobs, and I do believe the quality of formal education will continue its decline as the feds become more and more involved with producing citizens.",
