They often disagree with each other about what that relationship is. I know a lot of people who claim there are miracles. However, there is no objective evidence that any 'Miracle' that is beyond natural occurances happen. I have heard the many claims, but you know what?? The people who make teh claims are unable to come up with any verification of it. \n \n Our bodies heal. Eventually,they don't.. but they often will, all by themselves. No need for a god. This abilty to heal is a survivial characteristic brought about by random variation followed by the filter of natural selection.",
