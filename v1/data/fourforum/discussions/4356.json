   "Sounds like another carrot and stick talk, begging Europe to help with our Iraqi mess, threats to Syria and Iran, tsk tsk to Russia and again the wonders of spreading democracy in the ME. Alliance, US/Europe, used 12 times in his speech. Beating the democracy in the ME thing to death isn't going to sway Europe when we're doing it with guns and stating that's still an option with Iran. \n \n http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=519033",

   "It seems a little premature of Mr Bush to speak of \"democratic Iraq\" as a beacon of freedom and a source of stability that can depended on in the fight against \"terror\". (Wishful thinking here ?)\n \n The political future of Iraq remains opaque at present: there's no reason to suppose that once even a nominally \"democratic\" regime is installed, that Western interests will be served by it. There are reasons to suspect that the pull of Moslem solidarity will prove more powerful than the wish to please (or perhaps appease) America. Gratitude for being given the \"present\" of liberty etc., seems most unlikely.",

   "I found a number of his points to be sugar-coated assumptions followed by thinly veiled threats. If he truly is seeking alliance and equality with Europe I think he needs some lessons in diplomacy or a larger military. He did skip the UK, offering Blair some slack during his difficult times. \n \n A few minutes of his speech on radio offered no signs of improvement on the flat, monologue delivery style, definitely a sleep inducer.",
