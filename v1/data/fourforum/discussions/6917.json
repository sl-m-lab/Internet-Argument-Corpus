What I was commenting on was that DamEtel said that the Christian faith stands that Jesus IS God. My saying that he is considered the \"Son of\" God was that he wasn't God but in part was a part of God. However, my original point was that the three religions have the same creation story because the core religion comes from the same place. In fact, many of the early leaders of the Christian church insisted that you had to be Jewish before you could be Christian. Then when the Islamic faith got started (around 611 AD) it was a mixture of the two and the Arabian religions turned monotheistic. In many respects, (many more than some are willing to say) the 3 religions parallel the others in some ways.",
