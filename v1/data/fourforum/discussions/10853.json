   "look at this picture of this adorable kitten and notice the look of fear on his face. In 54 years of life I don't remember ever seeing an animal look afraid of anything. I've seen what appears to be joy and anger, but never fear. But this kitten looks afraid to me. Or is it just stress? Is there a difference between the two emotions for animals? Any personal stories of observations you have made in your experiences with animals, either first hand or as observations?\n \n http://news.yahoo.com/nphotos/Most-Emailed-Photos-Amman/ss/1756/im:/080123/photos_od/2008_01_23t113101_450x349_us_kitten/;_ylt=AlLA8ksfATYm29oQA95tyUXmWMcF",
