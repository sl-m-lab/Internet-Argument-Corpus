   "Teen's abortion at issue\n \n \n \n UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL \n PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Authorities say a Florida woman allowed her 17-year-old daughter to have an abortion to protect the girl's stepfather from sexual battery charges. \n Police said they needed to examine the unborn child to determine whether the 17-year-old had been impregnated by her stepfather, as she had told Palm Beach County Sheriff Department officials, the Palm Beach Post reported. \n The opportunity to prove that the stepfather had impregnated the girl was lost, authorities told the newspaper, when the mother took the teenager to a Broward County abortion clinic without notifying authorities.\n \n The 40-year-old stepfather was arrested May 20 on charges of familial or custodial sexual battery related to a reported sexual act in April with the 17-year-old, the newspaper reported. The mother, 33, has been charged with tampering with physical evidence and with child neglect. Both are free on $5,000 bond. \n The 17-year-old and her sister have been placed with the Florida Department of Children and Families, the Post said. \n \n http://washingtontimes.com/culture/20050530-111121-1238r.htm \n \n opinions",
