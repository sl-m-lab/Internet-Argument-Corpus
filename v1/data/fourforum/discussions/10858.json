Now, please read this chapter IN CONTEXT and tell me where God is approving of anyone eating dung and drinking pee. Notice in verse 2 who sent Rabshakeh. It was the King of Assyria. Rabshakeh was the Kings messenger who was speaking threats of destruction to King hezekiah. In verse 12 it is this Pagan spewing threats that the jews on the Wall will eat dung and drink pee if Hezekiah refuses his demands. \n \n No where does this say or imply that God is condoning or even suggesting that anyone eat dung or drink pee. I posted a modern language translation below for easier understanding of what the chapter say's.\n Isa 36:2 And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army.

If the Isaiah verse is talking about eating poo and drinking pee and the bible is the word of God then God approves of eating eating poo and drinking pee. If you say it is out of context and God doesn't approve of eating poo and drinking pee then the bible is not the word of God.\n\n \n I've never heard anything so ridiculous in my life Matthew. Firstly because you yourself set the whole premise of this attack on the bible up by stating this, and I quote: Why is it ok in one instance to take a bible verse out of context but not in all cases. And secondly, the verse in Isaiah is reporting threats that an Assyrian Kings Messenger made against the people of Israel and Israel's King. They are the words of a Pagan, not a prophet of God.\n \n It also needs to be noted that the threat was empty and the people of Israel were never made to actually have to do such a thing. So the God of Israel protected His children from this threat and it was nothing more than empty lip service by a God hating Pagan, very much like yourself Matthew. How you can deduce from this statement that God somehow approves of eating poo and drinking pee shows just how willing you are to twist His truth into a lie that feeds your hate. And as for this statement:\n \n \nIf you say it is out of context and God doesn't approve of eating poo and drinking pee then the bible is not the word of God.\n\n \n Actually it say's just the opposite as it shows conclusively that the bible doesn't soft soap Israel's history but reports the good, the bad and the ugly, thereby allowing people like you to pick and choose attacks just like this that are based on nothing more than your desire to condemn and demonize Gods Holy Word.",

You have gone off the edge, Matt. This sort of ridiculousness will d nothing but allow anti-gay and creationists to point here when they are accused of quote mining.\n \n What you have done here is tantamount to an Anti-gay bigot taking a statement by a gay rights organization out of context: for example a part where the gay rights organization quotes someone they disagree with (on incest, for example) and proceeds to argue against that person - then the antigay quoteminer takes that quote and says that that is what Gay-rights activists support.\n \n \nIf the Isaiah verse is talking about eating poo and drinking pee and the bible is the word of God then God approves of eating eating poo and drinking pee. If you say it is out of context and God doesn't approve of eating poo and drinking pee then the bible is not the word of God.\n\n \n I've never read something so absurd - it is quite obvious that the Bible is dhowing a supposed conversation between two men - nothing in here is \"God\" saying anything.",

   "And if Christianity is in fact too absurd to believe, and too impossible to practice or convince others of, then isn't that solid evidence of the supernatural experience that is the salvation of one from unbelief to belief in God through Christ? Think about it samiinh. It could save your soul.\n\n Then what of belief to unbelief? You can say reason x, and whatever that reason you think that may be (stupidity, mental illness, delusion), the same can apply to your question of \"Why do people believe?\".\n \n Think about it, Archie boy. It could open your eyes.\n But it won't, probably because of your x.",
