   "My favorite band of all time is the political punk rock group Bad Religion. In the song \"News From the Front\", the second verse begins with lyrics that have been permanently seared onto my brain:\n \"Ignorance is the root of fear, and fear is the kindling of anger.\"\n From this verse you can extrapolate the logical conclusion that ignorance leads to anger through the vehicle of fear. But a recent event unfolding in my life has lead me to the conclusion that fear is much more complex than this and can come from many places other than simple ignorance. In the first place, people are not always afraid of things that are bad. For example, some people are afraid of success. Others become afraid when they feel strong romantic feelings for another person. This seems to spit in the face of logic. Why would a person spend their whole life lamenting their lonely life, only to run in fear when they finally find somebody to love? But at the same time, anybody who has been hopelessly in love can understand. When you love somebody that much, they have power over you, and that is scary. In my opinion, these feelings don't really boil down to ignorance, but I suppose I could be wrong. Sometimes I wish that love really was enough. It seems in today's society, that simply is not the case. Thank you for reading my rant. Happy Holidays!",
