   "Here is what he said in context. And as you can see, he also rejected giving marriage rights/benefits to unmarried straight couples also, not just to gay couples.\n Pope slams \"dismal\" theories on gay marriage rights\n \n By Reuters\n \n ROME (Reuters) - Pope Benedict spoke out on Friday against legal recognition for unmarried couples and \"dismal theories\" on the rights of gays to marry which he said stripped men and women of their innate sexual identity.\n \"I cannot hide my concern about legislation on de facto couples,\" the Pope said in a Christmas address to the Rome clergy, weighing into a raging debate in Italy over what legal rights should be given to unmarried and gay couples.\n Tensions have been rising in recent months between the Vatican and left-wing parties in Prime Minister Romano Prodi's ruling coalition, which has pledged to grant some kind of legal recognition to unmarried couples.\n Some centre-left politicians have scorned the Vatican for speaking out against the initiative, but the Pope said the Church had the right to be heard.\n \"If they say the Church shouldn't interfere in these matters, then we can only reply: should mankind perhaps not interest us?\" he said.\n The Pope said granting legal recognition to unwed couples was a threat to traditional marriage, which required a higher level of commitment.\n But he saved his strongest words for those who suggest gay couples should be put on the same level as a husband and wife.\n \"This tacitly accredits those dismal theories that strip all relevance from the masculinity and femininity of the human being as though it were a purely biological issue,\" the Pope said.\n Theories \"according to which man should be able to decide autonomously what he is and what he isn't,\" end up with mankind destroying its own identity, he said.\n Two parliamentarians in the ruling coalition this week outraged fellow lawmakers by placing four dolls representing homosexual couples near the baby Jesus in the official nativity scene in Italy's parliament.\n They said their gesture was to promote legal recognition for unmarried couples and the legalisation of gay marriage.\n ",

It was written by man, simple. It is a collecton of books over time, stories chaned over time. It has even ben altered in modern times. THere are many versions of it.\n \n How is gay marriage not accepted? Does not god cadone Slavery and allow it? It is the word of the bible. Yet why do we find it not a moral thing in this society? How can you as a christian not practice or cadoen slavery, yet stand up agianst gay rights? The bible speaks of a man to serve her husband, even allowing him to stone her to death for adultry. WHy do we not start stonign woman he cheat on their husbands (and there are such a hudge ammount who do)? Why is a man less punished?\n \n During the times those boosk were written, slavery was an accepted part of society, therefore it was written into those books and claimed to be the owrd of god, when demed fit. Wake up people. The evidence to that is pretty darn clear.\n \n How can Catholics find it acceptable to alter and change the bible? Why was the name of god removed? Removed in ways so the scrptures actually no longer make since? You find this acceptable?\n \n PLain and simple. We do not need altered religious groups supporting us. Nor do we want these churches performing unity/marriages. It is a bond sacred to two people. I don't want a religion allowign slavery to perform it.",
