Still an empty tank. There is an objective reality.\n\n \n A physical reality can be easily proven or disproven to be true assuming our senses or tools are gathering the information correctly. We can show that a tank is either full or empty because it is physical. The tank being full or empty lines up with reality therefore it is truth, as you stated earlier. However, if truth is only judged based on whether it lines up with reality or not then can we find the truth as to whether democracy or communism is better? In reality we may be free, happy, and wealthy because of what democracy has allowed us to accomplish and democracy has defeated all but a handful of the communist supporters. Does reality dictate that freedom, happiness, and wealth are better than not having them? I don't think reality can show that as it can show that a tank is full rather than empty.\n \n \nThe nature of that reality is up for debate. My argument would be that testing those \"realities\" and how they line up with my observations will give me a basis for a reality over another reality.\n\n \n I believe using reality to determine truth only works for physical tests and logical information. X = 2 + 3. It is true that X is 5. The tank is full so it is true that the tank is not empty. I feel hungry. Is it true that I am hungry? Truth cannot be determined here as in reality there is no criteria for determining the answer. I believe driving a car is better than taking a bus. Is it true that taking a car is better than taking a bus? There is again no criteria in reality to determine whether this is true or not. All these things should have answers but much more information is required to determine them and of course human needs as well as society, cultural, historical, and future needs will become the center focus of this information gathering.\n \n Can we really determine the truth only through lining ideas up with reality? As long as human needs enter the mix and will often conflict with reality, I don't think you can use reality to determine the truthfulness of feelings and ideas.",

   "Why Bother With Truth?\n \n How can we know the world around us? \n \n How can we know God? \n \n How can we know anything at all? \n \n These are some of the questions of epistemology, the study of theories of knowledge. \n \n Epistemology has two main goals. First, we want to find as much truth as possible. And second, we want to avoid as much falsehood as possible. These two goals stand in tension with each other. I can easily acquire very large amounts of truth. If I were totally gullible, I&#8217;d believe just everything I hear. That would give me the largest number of true beliefs possible. But the problem is that along with all the true beliefs I&#8217;d acquire, I&#8217;d also obtain many false beliefs. So I&#8217;d have some needles of truth hidden in a very large haystack of error. That wouldn&#8217;t help me much.\n \n Similarly, I could easily avoid as much error as possible. If I were completely skeptical, I&#8217;d disbelieve everything. That would safeguard me against every falsehood. But the problem is that I&#8217;d miss out on all truth whatsoever&#8212;and some truth might be very important. So that wouldn&#8217;t help me much either.\n \n No one urges us to believe absolutely everything. But some very important and influential thinkers do advise us to believe nothing (or very little)&#8212;or at least they recommend that we believe only when an idea is incredibly well supported. This is skepticism. \n \n Skepticism puts most of its energies into avoiding error, and very little effort into finding truth. So how can we develop an understanding of epistemology that goes beyond skepticism? How can we balance our desire for truth with our need to avoid error?\n \n Truth and Knowledge\n \n It&#8217;s critical to distinguish truth and knowledge. Too many people equate these two concepts, with chaotic results. But truth and knowledge are different concepts. Put simply, true affirmations are those that correspond to reality. So truth is a characteristic of statements that properly describe aspects of the real world. This is called the correspondence view of truth.\n \n The correspondence view of truth isn&#8217;t a method for testing truth claims or discovering knowledge. It&#8217;s a definition of what we mean when we say that a statement &#8220;is true.&#8221; According to the correspondence view, what makes a statement true is reality itself.\n \n A Brief Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge - Click Here",

   "Quote:\n \n Very simply stated, truth is the judgment expressed when we use the word \"is.\"\n \n The verb \"is\" asserts some-thing about reality to which the statement conforms. \n \n In other words, the statement \"This is so,\" expresses a state of existence that is real, and not dependent on belief in it in order to make it true. The reality being represented is objective, universal, and transcendent. This is precisely the logic by which we operate, and the logic by which we either make statements about reality or make denials about what is not real. \n \n \"The logic of truth is the same for all exclusionary claims to truth\"\n \n (Mortimer Adler, Truth in Religion, p. 10).\n \n Truth by definition is exclusive. If truth were all-inclusive, nothing would be false. And if nothing were false, what would be the meaning of true? Furthermore, if nothing were false, would it be true to say that everything is false? It quickly becomes evident that nonsense would follow. In short, therefore, truth boils down to two tests: Statements must correspond to reality, and any system of thought that is developed as a result must be coherent. The correspondence and coherence tests are applied by all of us in matters that affect us.\n \n Therefore, when Jesus said, \"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No man comes to the Father except through me,\" He was making a very reasonable statement by affirming truth's exclusivity. \n \n The question one may legitimately ask is whether He demonstrated that claim rather than just stating it.\n \n The Inextinguishable Light",

Truth, as we've established, is a human construct made up of Meaning and Value, which this argument has nothing to do with.\n\n \n Your deconstruction of that particular definition is interesting. It does not deny that stating \"there is no absolute truth\" is indeed an absolute truth. It equivocates the meaning as stated. An absolute truth is something that is always true. Absolute meaning without exception. Truth meaning the lining up of what is real with what is stated. Something is either true or false. Truth is not a construct. The expression of truth may be a construct (I say may be) but something is either true or false. To say nothing is ever true is a fallacy. It is like saying \"everything I say is a lie\". It is a fallacious argument.",

No, because we'd already know where it falls in the Ultimate Right/Wrong equation. We disagree about it because our respective internal concepts of it are in conflict. \n \n Let's look at the brain-bashing example you give. You bash in my head, unprovoked, because in your concept of right and wrong, it is absolutely the right thing to do. Except for the fact that I wind up dead, this is conceptually okay with me.

Because unless everyone else in the world has also inverted their notions on murder, you're still gonna get the chair for a cold-blooded killing (well, actually, probably life in prison and a lot of psychotherapy).

Your statement is basically \"if there were an objective right or wrong to an issue, people would still disagree with it because they wouldn't necessarily believe it.\" I have two things to say to this: 1) If it were an objective truth, it should be demonstrateable as such, and as science has shown us, given enough time, people will come around to the truth. 2) This argument still doesn't get you any closer to proving me wrong, or yourself right. You haven't explained how any truth about Right or Wrong could be objective. Your arguments so far have only amounted to emotional objections to the implications of my arguments. You have not demonstrated how your Abortion is Ultimately Wrong statement (as an example) could in fact be a reality.\n \n \nRelative to a group is a problem as one heads into issues of war at that point.\n\n \n You want to talk about who is proving whose points? You are right on the nose with this statement! Look around you! Do you not see war? Blood feuds? Disputes over land and ideas? All because two or more groups are in disagreement over what is Right. History is full of this, yet we have endured, and the quality of life continues to improve for (almost) everyone. That these conflicts continue is evidence to me that there is no Ultimate Right & Wrong and that it's up to us to simply agree on how to make the most of our time on this planet and not blow ourselves to smitherines.\n \n Oh, and please don't call me Tastyfish.
