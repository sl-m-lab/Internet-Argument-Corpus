   "Peter Arnett, a reporter for National Geographic and NBC, has put himself in a position where he has become a propagandist for the enemy. He appeared on Iraqi T.V. on Sunday night, and told the Iraqi regime that the U.S war plan has been an utter failure, and he also complimented the Iraqi forces for their sheer determination.\n \n Unfortunately, for those on the left, this action taken by Arnett, will have consequences for the antiwar movement. Serious fallout over the comments that Arnett made in an official interview with Iraqi officials will hit the Beltway tomorrow. It has become necessary to start charging those who deliberately sabotage the antiwar movement. It seems that the Justice Department is going to have to issue a number of arrests to demonstrate that this kind of activity is no longer tolerable in a time of war.\n \n There are three different crimes that people like Arnet can be charged with.\n \n 1.) Article 3 of the United States Constitution\n \n Section 3. Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.\n \n It will be no problem finding two witnesses, as this interview is currently airing all over the world.\n \n 2.) The U.S. Sedition Act of 1918\n \n SECTION 3. Whoever, when the United States is at war, shall willfully make or convey false reports or false statements with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces of the United States, or to promote the success of its enemies, or shall willfully make or convey false reports, or false statements, . . . or incite insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty, in the military or naval forces of the United States, or shall willfully obstruct . . . the recruiting or enlistment service of the United States, or . . . shall willfully utter, print, write, or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language about the form of government of the United States, or the Constitution of the United States, or the military or naval forces of the United States . . . or shall willfully display the flag of any foreign enemy, or shall willfully . . . urge, incite, or advocate any curtailment of production . . . or advocate, teach, defend, or suggest the doing of any of the acts or things in this section enumerated and whoever shall by word or act support or favor the cause of any country with which the United States is at war or by word or act oppose the cause of the United States therein, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or both....\n \n Obviously, his remarks were meant for those purposes in bold print.\n \n 3.) Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 105, Section 2153. - Destruction of war material, war premises, or war utilities\n \n (a) Whoever, when the United States is at war, or in times of national emergency as declared by the President or by the Congress, with intent to injure, interfere with, or obstruct the United States or any associate nation in preparing for or carrying on the war or defense activities, or, with reason to believe that his act may injure, interfere with, or obstruct the United States or any associate nation in preparing for or carrying on the war or defense activities, willfully injures, destroys, contaminates or infects, or attempts to so injure, destroy, contaminate or infect any war material, war premises, or war utilities, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than thirty years, or both. \n \n (b) If two or more persons conspire to violate this section, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each of the parties to such conspiracy shall be punished as provided in subsection (a) of this section.\n \n I don't think it would be too hard to prove the conspiracy charge on the part of the news agency that gave him the go ahead to do the interview and then released it for public consumption.\n \n Things are about to get tough for those antiwar proponents, as they have put themselves in direct violation of these laws in many cases. Unfortunately, your free speech is going to suffer as a result of a few irresponsible journalists. I assume the ramifications of the Arnett interview will be felt for years, as another chilling effect will occur because of the need to crack down on enemy propaganda. If our news networks are going to produce propaganda for the enemy, then they should be subject to these laws. \n \n source: CNN",

No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.\n Giving aid and comfort to the enemy refers to material assistance not lip service.\n \n \nInterfere with, or obstruct the United States or any associate nation in preparing for or carrying on the war or defense activities, willfully injures, destroys, contaminates or infects, or attempts to so injure, destroy, contaminate or infect any war material, war premises, or war utilities\n What material, premises, or utilities were damaged by one mans opinion?\n \n \n2.) The U.S. Sedition Act of 1918 SECTION 3. Whoever, when the United States is at war, shall willfully make or convey false reports or false statements with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces of the United States, or to promote the success of its enemies, or shall willfully make or convey false reports, or false statements\n When did congress declare war, with out congress there is no war.\n \n Is the 1st amendment on hold because the news calls it a war? Peter Arnett should be covered by the 1st. I think Theodore Roosevelt said it best,\" To announce that there must be no criticism of the president, or that we are to stand by the president, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public\"",
