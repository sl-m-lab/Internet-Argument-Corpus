   "By 365gay Newscenter Staff\n 04.15.2009 11:35am EDT\n \n (Gloucester, Massachusetts) Two brothers have been charged in a beating that left a gay Massachusetts man with a shattered jaw, broken eye socket, broken nose and broken cheek bone.\n \n Justin Goodwin, 36, of Salem, underwent nine hours of surgery following the weekend attack. His jaw is wired shut and he lost vision in one eye as a result of bruising. His vision has returned but family members say more surgery will be scheduled when Goodwin's condition is stabilized.\n \n Goodwin was attacked by up to six people on Saturday in an alley next to a bar in Gloucester.\n \n Two of the attackers were identified by witnesses.\n \n William J. Chadwick, 21, was picked up by police and Jonathan Chadwick, 23, turned himself in after learning an arrest warrant had been issued.\n \n Both have been charged with aggravated assault and battery and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.\n \n Police say they are continuing to investigate and more charges may follow.\n \n Goodwin's family believe he was attacked because he is gay. They want hate crime charges added.\n \n Police reports obtained by The Gloucester Times show that under police questioning, Jonathan Chadwick said he witnessed the beating but was not involved.\n \n His brother has denied any involvement, but The Times reports that he went to a Gloucester pizza shop on Monday to apologize to Goodwin's sister's boyfriend, who witnessed the beating and works at the pizza shop.\n \n Both brothers have criminal records. Jonathan Chadwick had been given a suspended sentence for larceny, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon stemming from an incident in August 2006.\n \n In a court appearance in connection with the attack on Goodwin, the 2006 sentence was reinstated and he was ordered to spend a year behind bars.\n \n William Chadwick was given an 18-month suspended sentence for a separate 2006 arrest for marijuana possession, marijuana possession with intent to distribute and carrying a dangerous weapon.",
