   "Gods own team - DA BEARZZZ - will be punishing the San Freekcisco 69...errr...49ers this sunday in Chicago.\n \n Thomas Jones re-bruised his ribs last sunday so look for the rookie, Cedric Benson from Texas, to bust loose for 200+ running yards. The kid ain't the brightest bulb but he's a horse and he's ready to bust out of the corral.\n \n Kyle Orton (QB) is developing nicely for a rookie. He is showing patience. He is making a minimum of rookie mistakes and is finally running out of the tackle-box/pocket and throwing the ball away when no one is open. He has a really crappy beard however...it actually makes him look even YOUNGER! \n \n The spread is Bears by 12 1/2 as of today. It might be a good bet. Ex-Bear Mike Singeltary is a defensive coach for San Fran. \n \n BEARZZZ 35 San Freekcisco 14",

   "Of course, he was off on the closeness of the game. But I think his prediction was made before one of the players of the Chiefs had to retire because of a lump on his spine. Now, I'm don't usually pay attention to the Chiefs but since I do live in a KC suburb, that's most of the sports news I get. And I study Journalism and so I try to pay attention to the news. But if I understand it correctly, the player I'm mentioning was one of the star players. If he had been able to play, Bassman would have had a better chance at the accurate final score.",
