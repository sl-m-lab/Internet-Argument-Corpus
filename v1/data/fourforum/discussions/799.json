   "Guns are banned, now what?\n \n 1) Gun confiscation? \n \n The government just takes them away? That is property confiscation and unconstitutional. You may call it confiscation. I call it stealing. The government just takes your property and gives you no compensation? Yep that is stealing. It is never a good idea to let the government take the property of good people. Especially since I have broken no law, committed no crime. You may argue that I broke the law by just keeping my guns, but the government manufactured me into a criminal. I was not a criminal before the ban, now I am retroactive criminal? Maybe you agree with criminalizing firearm ownership, well this is what happens: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/england/2248511.stm . Good men get locked up with rapist and murders, and are ruined. \n \n \n 2) Gun buy back?\n \n A well made personal defense handgun starts at about $300. Custom rifles can be more than $3000. I have only one .22 that starts at $225. My other firearms are between $800 and $1500. Granted junk Saturday night specials can be between $50-150. Collectable firearms are priceless.\n \n There are 230 million firearms in this country. If the government just pays an average of $100 for every firearm, that is 23 BILLION dollars. You will never get Congress to allocate 23 billion dollars. They back stab each other for 10 million dollars.\n \n Both ideas are just dumb.",
