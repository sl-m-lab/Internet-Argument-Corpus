Eight states have already placed restrictions on salvia, and 16 others, including Florida, are considering a ban or have previously.\n \n \"As soon as we make one drug illegal, kids start looking around for other drugs they can buy legally. This is just the next one,\" said Florida state Rep. Mary Brandenburg, who has introduced a bill to make possession of salvia a felony punishable by up to five years in prison.\n \n Some say legislators are overreacting to a minor problem, but no one disputes that the plant impairs judgment and the ability to drive.\n \n Native to Mexico and still grown there, Salvia divinorum is generally smoked but can also be chewed or made into a tea and drunk.\n \n Called nicknames like Sally-D, Magic Mint and Diviner's Sage, salvia is a hallucinogen that gives users an out-of-body sense of traveling through time and space or merging with inanimate objects. Unlike hallucinogens like LSD or PCP, however, salvia's effects last for a shorter time, generally up to an hour.\n \n Salvia divinorum is not one of the several varieties of common ornamental garden plants known as Salvia.\n \n No known deaths have been attributed to salvia's use, but it was listed as a factor in one Delaware teen's suicide two years ago.\n \n \"Parents, I would say, are pretty clueless,\" said Jonathan Appel, an assistant professor of psychology and criminal justice at Tiffin University in Ohio who has studied the emergence of the substance. \"It's much more powerful than marijuana.\"\n \n Salvia's short-lasting effects and the fact that it is currently legal may make it seem more appealing to teens, lawmakers say. In the Delaware suicide, the boy's mother told reporters that salvia made his mood darker but he justified its use by citing its legality. According to reports, the autopsy found no traces of the drug in his system, but the medical examiner listed it as a contributing cause.\n \n Mike Strain, Louisiana's Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner and former legislator, helped his state in 2005 become the first to make salvia illegal, along with a number of other plants. He said the response has been largely positive.\n \n \"I got some hostile e-mails from people who sold these products,\" Strain said. \"You don't make everybody happy when you outlaw drugs. You save one child and it's worth it.\"\n \n An ounce of salvia leaves sells for around $30 on the Internet. A liquid extract from the plant, salvinorin A, is also sold in various strengths labeled \"5x\" through \"60x.\" A gram of the 5x strength, about the weight of a plastic pen cap, is about $12 while 60x strength is around $65. And in some cases the extract comes in flavors including apple, strawberry and spearmint.\n \n Web sites such as Salviadragon.com tout the product with images like a waterfall and rainbow and include testimonials like \"It might sound far fetched, but I experience immortality.\"\n \n Among those who believe the commotion over the drug is overblown is Rick Doblin of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, a nonprofit group that does research on psychedelic drugs and whose goal is to develop psychedelics and marijuana into prescription medication.\n \n \"I think the move to criminalize is a misguided response to a very minimal problem,\" Doblin said.\n \n Doblin said salvia isn't \"a party drug,\" \"tastes terrible\" and is \"not going to be extremely popular.\" He disputes the fact teens are its main users and says older users are more likely.\n \n \"It's a minor drug in the world of psychedelics,\" he said.\n \n It's hard to say how widespread the use of salvia is. Because it is legal in most states, law enforcement officials don't compile statistics.\n \n A study of released last month by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services found just under 2 percent of people age 18 to 25 surveyed in 2006 reported using salvia in the past year. A 2007 survey of more than 1,500 San Diego State University students found that 4 percent of participants reported using salvia in the past year.\n \n Brandenburg's bill would make salvia and its extract controlled substances in the same class as marijuana and LSD.\n \n Florida state Sen. Evelyn Lynn, whose committee unanimously passed the salvia bill on Tuesday, said the drug should be criminalized.\n \n \"I'd rather be at the front edge of preventing the dangers of the drug than waiting until we are the 40th or more,\" she said.\n\n \n Anyone here who has actually tried Salvia should be able to tell you that it has an extremely low potential for abuse. The problem say many lawmakers, is that this is a dangerous drug with unknown future effects on health that can impair motor skills and judgement. I have seen other articles claiming that Salvia can lead to cardiovascular collapse, suicide, and death. Isn't this the same way they turned public opinion to make Marijuana illegal? Shameful. It is clear that the people claiming these dangers really don't have a clue what they are talking about. Salvia is far less dangerous (as is Marijuana for that matter) than is alcohol, the LEGAL substance that both millions of teens and adults use to excess. Alcohol poses many immediate and known long term threats to health, siginificant impairment of motor skills and judgement. Alcohols effects last on average 8-10 hours following significant consumption, the effects of Salvia last approximately 45-60 minutes. \n \n So why the push to make Salvia illegal while I can watch 45 beer commercials and 30 alcohol commercials on television during a sunday afternoon of Nascar or football? Isn't this an extreme example of blatent hypocrisy by our lawmakers? They operate under the guise of wanting to protect our children against minimal to non-existent dangers of Salvia, yet alcohol is left completely untouched? If they really cared about the health and wellbeing of Americans, they would push for prohibition again. \n \n It's the economy stupid! Plain and simple, it is the economy.",

   "Alright, I've just ordered some from Bouncing Bear. We'll see what all the hoopla's about.\n\n \n Thank you for proving another point. Salvia has been up until recently relatively unknown. It has been the screaming of lawmakers and undue attention of the controversy hungry media that has brought Salvia into the spotlight. Until recently, very few people even really knew of it's existence. Quotes from lawmakers reported in the media have spoken about how dangerous this \"marijuana substitute\" is, and how it can lead to \"cardiovascular collapse\" and death. Nothing could really be farther from the truth. There is no evidence of anyone ever dying from ingestion of Salvia. \n \n This is how our lawmakers work. Take an unknown substance that the public knows very little about, rant about non-existent dangers to scare the ignorant public and make them fear for the lives of their children, turn public opinion against it, and then push to make it illegal. This makes our lawmakers look like the hero out to protect our children, and in turn secures votes. It's a rediculous waste of time and money that will accomplish nothing in the way of actually protecting children. If our lawmakers actually cared about our children, they would be working on important issues like improving education, making post secondary education affordable, providing healthcare, shelter, and food to poor children, and locking up dangerous predators. Doesn't it shock anyone to realize that it takes a show like Dateline to bring internet predators into the spotlight in this country? \n \n But instead, our politicians will him and haw about this \"dangerous drug\" until they sufficiently turn public opinion against it, and finally make it one more reason to lock people up in our overcrowded prisons. They make a big deal out of it, the media makes a huge deal out of it, and millions of people who have never heard about it suddenly think it is the greatest danger facing our children since Chinese toys. In fact, the constant attention from the media only causes countless children to do exactly what you did...suddenly go out and purchase a substance that they know little about, and use it without fully understanding what it is or what it does. Soon, every time a teen commits suicide, it will be due to their horrible addiction to this killer drug. The lawmakers will scream about how the usage of Salvia has gone up exponentially over the last 6 months, and how this scourge against public safety needs to be addressed now. It's rediculous...but the wheels are now turning. \n \n Some points on Salvia:\n 1. It is a type of Sage.\n 2. It has been used by the Mazatec natives of southern Mexico for thousands of years in ritual ceremonies.\n 3. Smoking of Salvia is not the traditional method, and produces often intense but short lived experiences. (5-10 minutes) Salvia has traditionally been used by a wad of leaves being chewed.",

   "You've got it right about grandstanding politicians. There's no risk and all reward. It makes them look like they're 'doing something' to help society, when all they are doing is taking the focus off of important issues. Hell, even the whole drug issue could be helped immensely with 5% or so of what they spend to lock people up spent on treatment. But 'treatment' doesn't sound 'tough' enough so they've got to put on a song and dance. Why would you expect any of them to do what's right over what's best at getting them elected?",

   "It's kind of ironic that you include \"internet predators\" in the list of serious risks to children. The chances of a child being abused by a stranger are remote, and with regard to the internet can be minimised by parents having a clue.\n\n \n The point was (and if you noticed, I said both \"dangerous predators\" and \"internet predators\") that there is far more action by private organizations to fight victimization of children than there is from the government. The Dateline reference was merely and example. As a citizen who helps fund local, state, and federal law enforcement through my taxes, I find it simply unacceptable that our government wastes time scaring the population about things which pose little to no threat to our children rather than focusing efforts on more prevelant dangers. \n \n As to statistics, there are more than enough places to find them. You are correct that children are most often abused by someone they know, actually to the tune of ~80%. But that means that ~20% of children are victims of strangers. 20% does not sounds \"remote\" to me, considering ~900,000 children are victims of abuse or neglect. Being that it is difficult to be neglected by strangers, it stands to reason that ~180,000 children are victims of \"abuse\" by strangers. Abuse by a stranger is often more likely to be rooted in sexual predation. \n \n And yes, it is important for parents to control what their children see and do while on the internet, but it is not always possible. Statistics show that parents are becoming more internet savy and are making improvements in safeguarding children, but there is a long way to go. \n \n The overall point, and please don't miss it, is that our government chooses to waste it's time and our taxpayer dollars scaring the population about a \"dangerous drug\" that has no known deaths attributed to it in the guise of protecting children, yet ignore or don't do enough in the face of the real threats which plague and kill children every day.",

Did you get the regular dried leaf or one of the concentrated versions? \n \n If you have never tried Salvia, you are probably in for quite a shock. Many people who buy it online from the myriad of websites are college kids. They like to think \"it can't be too powerful, it's legal\". They think that the more potent the extract they buy the better. They think that if the regular leaf is enough to do something, then the 30X leaf will be 30x better. Wrong. Ingestion of regular Salvia leaf can produce quite intense experiences. Ingestion of the concentrated leaf can produce downright scary experiences. Many college kids who try Salvia use way too much, and it is often an experience that they never want to try again. Using the proper dose, especially by chewing on a desired amount of leaves is much more conducive to a wonderful experience. Start small, trust me.",
