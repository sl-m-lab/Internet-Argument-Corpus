   "The quad 50 full automatic anti-aircraft gun is designed to oscillate on it's mount. This is so that the bullets will come out in a pattern. This pattern along with tracer rounds helps the shooter guide the blizzard of bullets at the aircraft. Even this only works at low altitudes. Modern planes typically fly at ~30K feet. That's more than 5 miles high! A perfect bullet, or one that is fired in a vaccum with an initial velocity of 2800 fps will only go ~25k feet before gravity alone will have reduced it's velocity to 0 fps. The odds of hitting something that is moving at ~900 fps at any distance with a bullet traveling at ~2800fps are slim to none. That is why anti-aircraft guns are full auto, not a semiauto or anything that a citizen has access to legally.",

You are talking about something that is moving in the air REALLY fast and throwing something at it? Think about it. Also most of the freight cargo trains that carry those gas tanks, etc are bullet proof. When I say that I mean that it would take at least a couple of shots to penetrate the armor around it, in the same place (that means you'd have to shoot the tank in the same exact place to penetrate it.) Even then the tank would no explode like you see in movies, that's just, well, plain bs. It doesn't happen. It would take a specific round and specific location to ignite a tank like that. People need to realize bullets are not magic and penetrate everything you shoot at. Also it depends on the shot place as well. I can tell you now, very, very VERY, few people can shoot and hit their target half a mile away. It takes a lot of practice, time, and skill to shoot that far. Besides, if a terrorist would want to bring down a plane the best way to do that would be using RPG's or simply hijacking the plane and crashing it like they did on 911.",

   "Well yeah, we can buy the older models, but what're the chances of the modern navy still using the old models instead of trading up to the modern versions?\n\n \n The only difference between the old 50s and newer are the new have welded receivers instead of riveted and the barrel has a handle for changing a hot barrel. I believe that is the only real difference. Oh and they are a few pounds lighter. \n \n Here is where I have an issue with the banning of the 50 cal round it is unnecessary 50's are not used in crimes. What those who want to ban 50's is about potential. The potential of a 50 is why they want it banned is this not correct? Not that they are used to commit crimes but that they have the potential to be devastating right. So does a tractor-trailer have the potential to be devastating. Is this what it's about?\n \n Then you best look at men because they have a penis they have the potential to become a rapist. Don't forget the women too they have vaginas so there is a potential for prostitution, or home wrecking they are devastating to families are they not?\n \n Is this any less ridiculous as trying to ban guns that are black because you can't see them at night? They should be painted bright colors I actually had someone say this to me. I said you know your right but don't stop at guns lets paint the black people bright colors too since they are black and you can't see them at night either right?",

   "This discussion came up on another forum, with what appear to be some of the same participants. Here is a copy of the post I made on the subject.\n \n Before ripping the original post to shreds, I must say that the gun control folks make it way to easy to counter their emotional remarks... While the .50BMG is capable of impressive accuracy at long range, it is not simply a matter of putting the cross hairs on a target and pulling the trigger. To understand this, we have to look at the nature of projectiles in free flight, more commonly know as the study of ballistics. A bullet in flight is constantly slowing down and being drawn by gravity towards the earth. The farther it travels, the slower it goes, the more profound the effect of gravity is. Thus the arc of a bullet in flight is a parabolic arc rather than a linear arc. This is why you have to either adjust sights or aim higher as you increase the distance to the target. Let's look at the trajectory of a typical military loading. The following data aplies to the M-2 military ball weighing 709 grains with a muzzle velocity of 2,850fps. Distances are listed in yards and bullet drop is listed in inches.\n \n Distance to target / Bullet drop\n \n 100/ 0- this is the distance at which we have zeroed our sights meaning that point of aim=point of impact\n 200/ -4.8\n 300/ -14.6\n 400/ -30.2\n 500/ -52.2\n 600/ -81.2\n 700/ -118\n 800/ -162\n 900/ -218\n 1000/ -284\n \n Now for wind...Just like distance to the target, any effects from wind drift will result in a parabolic arc as well, because the wind has a longer period of time to act on the bullet within a given distance as the bullet slows down. A 10mph crosswind requires 56 inches of correction for a target that is at 1000 yards. This is if the 10mph wind remains constant throughout the distance to the target, which is seldom the case. Everything from wind shifts to geographic features will cause the effect of wind to vary from the time the bullet is launched, to the time that it arrives at the target.\n \n Moving targets...unfortunately bullets do not arrive at the target the instant we pull the trigger. The time of flight allows for a target to move out of the path of bullet. Let's assume a human target at walking speed of 2mph. A target at 1000 yards moving at 2mph would require you to lead the target by about 48 inches, or four feet. If we increase the speed of the target to 6mph our lead jumps to 144 inches! That's twelve feet!! And this is just for a target moving 6mph.\n \n Using this new found knowledge, let's look at the possibility of hitting a moving commercial aircraft. A 737 on approach for landing travels at about 150mph. This is slower than climb out speed so I chose this scenario to give the best possible chances of actually hitting it. At this speed we would have to lead the target by more than 300 feet. We would also have to constantly calculate and update the distance to the plane during the time leading up to the shot and adjust our aiming point to accommodate the distance. Oh, and don't forget that the plane is also moving in the vertical plane at a rate of 700 to 1000 feet per minute to stay on the glide slope for landing, so we have to account for that too. And don't forget the effect of wind, once again acting to shape our trajectory in a parabolic arc that increases or decreases in radius relative to distance. Wow!!! THAT\"S A LOT OF ON THE FLY CALCULATIONS!!!! What super computer did you say we were using to aim this thing?? Oh yea, this is also assuming that you could get within 1000 yards of the aircraft carrying a gun that is 5 feet long and weighs between 20 and forty pounds. Any doubt as to how ridiculous this claim is???\n \n One round could tear an arm of a man even if the round was 3 feet away from him.\n \n \n For this to be a possibility, it would have to be caused by the disruption of air around the bullet as a result of it's velocity. The simplest answer to this one is...If this were true, why does the same bullet at the same velocity punch nice clean holes in paper targets without tearing it to shreds?\n \n It could put holes in destroyers hulls and shred people in a manner of seconds. \n \n Even with armor piecing ammunition, the .50BMG penetrates only 1 inch of homogeneous armor plating from a distance of 200 yards. Having spent fiver years in the Navy, I can assure you that the armor plating on a destroyer is MUCH thicker than this.\n \n \n well its still dangerous enough to kill people especially children \n \n As was stated by others, any gun can be used to kill. The .50BMG less of a threat to chldren than many other things. The FBI Uniform crime reports show that in 2006, 126 infants under the age of 1 were murdered by what they term personal weapons (hands, feet, fists, ect.) I am only aware of one instance in which a .50 was used to murder someone in the U.S. That is not one time in 2006...That is one time period!!\n \n The argument of \"no legitimate sporting purpose\" holds no water either. The .50 BMG is frequently used for both hunting and target applications. On top of that, our second amendment makes no stipulation that the right to keep and bear arms is dependent on \"Sporting purpose\". On the contrary, the second amendment was intended to insure that the people of this nation had the means to resist a tyranical government. Based on that premise, the .50BMG is perfectly legitimate.\n \n By the way, I legally own three .50BMG guns...Two custom built target rifles and one belt fed, full auto M-2 (affectionately referred to as the Ma-duece).\n \n Have a nice day...\n \n JW",

I flinched when I read that a Destroyer had a half inch thick hull, but said nothing because I had no facts to rely on as evidence. Beside, it wasn't the issue of the debate.

   "Omegamon, \n \n I have been to Knob Creek, but not in several years. I typically do not have the time with all that I have on my plate. \n \n Ethmi, \n \n While it may seem odd, the typical naval vessel is not terribly well armored. The heaviest armor runs from the deepest draft point on the hull (this varies by ship mass due to loading, so the armor is extended above the point at which the ship would sit lowest in the water) down to the keel. This is to protect against torpedo attack. the upper levels of the hull are actually much thinner to conserve weight. The hull is a double wall arrangement stiffened with strut structures called frames, and are even partitioned for storage of fuel oil, potable water, chill water and waste, as well as other commodities. The 'superstructure\", those decks above the main weather deck or flight deck in the case of a carrier, are constructed from mild steel typically 3/16\" thick. Armor is less necessary on the upper decks, because the threat is more likely to be a missile than bullets. I am pretty sure that all modern Naval vessels, with the exception of submarines, employ the CWIS defense system. This is a six barreled 20mm Gatling cannon that is aimed and fired through a radar fire control system. When a threat (missile, plane, ect.) is identified as a threat, the fire control system tracks the target, measuring mass, range, speed and rate of closure. When a firing solution is derived, the system fires 11mm depleted uranium sabot rounds driven by aluminum \"pushers\" at a rate of 4000 rounds per minute. The fire control system continues to fire until the mass of the target is reduced by a specific percentage, sorry, but I don't recall all of the particulars. Typically there are at least two CWIS mounts on board ship and the tracking system has the ability to track many inbound threats and engage them with blazing speed and deadly accuracy. Did I mention that my Primary rating in the Navy was as a Gunner's Mate? LOL\n \n JW",
