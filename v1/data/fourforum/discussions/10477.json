   "Ex-Mexico Prez: Racists Stop Immigration\n NEW YORK (AP) - Former Mexican President Vicente Fox said Monday that the United States is letting racism dictate its policies, especially when it comes to immigration. \n \"The xenophobics, the racists, those who feel they are a superior race ... they are deciding the future of this nation,\" he said, without naming names, in an interview with The Associated Press. \n\n It's racist to want others to follow our laws when immigrating to our country?\n \n Guess I'm a racist.....though I don't feel superior just yet.",

It is unfortunate that the emotional power of the term \"racism\" overrides the LAW.\n \n The US has laws concerning immigration and they are not being followed.

After the election of the Marxist government in Chile, I like thousands of other people tried to emigrate rather than to live under a Marxist dictatorship similar to the one in Cuba. The US government refused us even tourist visas and in order to obtain a permanent visa or a work permit visa we were told we needed a job offer. Now, how could you find a job in the USA if you were in Chile? But that is not all, to be offered a job you needed a visa. How about that for a catch 22?\n Canada did one better, it closed its Embassy to visa applicants and to apply for a visa one needed to write to a postal box. I did so and my application was rejected for although I was an Electronic Engineer working at the NASA Satellite Tracking Station I was told that I would be unable to find a job in Canada.\n Years later when settled in Australia and having become an Australian citizen , just to check I applied for a permanent visa to Canada and was accepted in no time, why? Because I was not a greasy Latino anymore but an Aussie. Of course I said thanks but no thanks.\n Racism is rampant in the USA and also Canada specially against Latinos and my surname is a German one not Speedy Gonzales.",

   "While I do not think it's racism to arrest someone for breaking immigration laws, I do think our immigration laws are too strict. We are right in trying to reinforce border security, but we're doing it the wrong way. Our laws are restricting legal immigration to the US, but they're hardly helping solve the illegal immigrant problem. Out of the several million who apply for a green card annually, only about 50,000 actually get one. And try telling me these laws are helping when three border guards got thrown in prison for doing their job. The story that I find of particular interest, is this: one of those three guards was firing at a truck full of Mexican drug dealers; the driver was trying to run him over. One of his bullets grazed the upper lip of one of them, and for that, he got thrown in prison. The drug dealers recieved no punishment. In other words: THEY GOT AWAY SCOTT-FREE FOR ATTEMPTED HOMICIDE. After hearing this, I knew that the laws weren't stopping illegal immigrants. Legal immigrants on the other hand: unless a Mexican has a close friend or family member who is a US citizen, then he/she would have to get a degree in Engineering. Otherwise, there's no legal way for a Mexican to apply for a visa to the US, except as a tourist. If laws were always as strict as they are, very few of our ancestors would be able to immigrate to the US. Our laws are only keeping law abiding citizens out, while they don't have much effect on illegal immigration.
