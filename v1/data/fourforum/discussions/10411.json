I don't care how \"sacred\" (whatever that means) or important a ludicrous belief is to you, it doesn't make it any less ludicrous. \n\n \n Ok. But when it comes to THIS particular case, you're very much in the minority (in this country anyway) in terms of opinion that it's a goofy idea. Christianity is only considered a \"goofy\" idea by atheists, typically, and even then there are some atheists who see value in religion even then. As much as you'd like to consider Christianity in the same league as things MOST people consider goofy, most people don't. (Simply on the basis that most people in this country are, in fact, religious.) What determines whether an idea is goofy in society is whether society views it that way, and the most that can be said here is that YOU think it's goofy. \n \n Personally, I just don't understand why you can't respect someone's beliefs even when it's religion. You take any opportunity you can to call it things like \"goofy\" and \"magic\" knowing full well it's a sensitive issue for many people. I can think of no other reason someone would take that approach (rather than a civil and less disrespectful one) other than prejudice. Or maybe saying such things allow you to see it get a rise out of people. Every attempt I've made here, via analogy, to get you to see that this is a very dear and deeply important issue to people you just swipe away ('as a one-trick pony comeback') refusing to get it. You just don't care that it's dear to people, do you?\n \n \nIf you are a Christian and you object to someone mocking Christianity, you oughta be complaining to the guy asking for $1000 \"seed money\" that guarantees your earthly and eternal security, rather than some self-admitted D-list comedian. \n\n \n Well, honestly I'd hope that someone as reasoned as yourself would be able to make the distinction between religion and huckstering. Is that not the case? In other words, unless someone isn't even willing to do the least bit of critical thinking and know that Christianity doesn't equal huckstering (requiring barely cracking open Jesus' teachings to determine), I shouldn't have to. Unless of course, you're out to connect dots that aren't even there.\n \n (By the way, sorry that I've sounded rather cynical here. I've just run into so many people who don't even entertain the possibility (let alone realise) they are operating from their prejudices in their criticism of religion that it gets tough sometimes measuring up the the very civility I'm calling for here. So for that, sorry.)",

In the middle of the program when when the arc is supposed to have risen up and floated on the waves, they darkened the set and lowered this tiny movie screen 10 by 10 and showed a cartoon of the arc in the water.

The comment would never even been known about. It was made in some off-the-air special version of the Emmy's. It was only made very public by the ad.\n \n Now that I think about it, the Miracle Theater company probably took out the ad as a calculated move to increase their own publicity. They bill themselves as wholesome family entertainment. It would not do to rant against the fake preachers on TV, because the sheep that send the hucksters money are likely the Miracle Theater's best customers. They bill themselves as the answer to the evil entertainment of godless Hollywood, so they need to find a suitable godless enemy to attack. The $100K was probably a drop in the bucket of their advertising budget. It was just another maneuver to prey on the credulous.

   "Regarding your last statement there, yes it does. It doesn't to you personally, but in the grand scheme of things in terms of whether something is \"goofy\" or unbelievable in society, it makes all the difference in the world how many hold these beliefs. YOUR opinion is that it's \"goofy\". Many see it differently. But my point is that even if you DO think it's \"goofy\", you should still show respect toward people when something is very dear and sacred to them. Again, one might think it's \"goofy\" for a grieving person to think their deceased relative is in heaven. You should still show respect.\n\n \n Once again, I am not talking to grieving relatives, now am I? Please drop that. A preposterous idea is still preposterous even if you (or many, many others) hold it sacred. I am in a forum discussing whether believing in god is rational or not. I am not in someone's parlor attacking them as they pray. I do not need to show respect for irrational ideas. I say it is not rational based upon the definition of the word rational. You may disagree. \n \n The reasons for belief in your deity are not adequately explained rationally. To quote Sam Harris, :\n\"It is perfectly absurd for religious moderates to suggest that a rational human being can believe in God simply because this belief makes him happy, relieves his fear of death or gives his life meaning. The absurdity becomes obvious the moment we swap the notion of God for some other consoling proposition: Imagine, for instance, that a man wants to believe that there is a diamond buried somewhere in his yard that is the size of a refrigerator. No doubt it would feel uncommonly good to believe this. Just imagine what would happen if he then followed the example of religious moderates and maintained this belief along pragmatic lines: When asked why he thinks that there is a diamond in his yard that is thousands of times larger than any yet discovered, he says things like, \"This belief gives my life meaning,\" or \"My family and I enjoy digging for it on Sundays,\" or \"I wouldn't want to live in a universe where there wasn't a diamond buried in my backyard that is the size of a refrigerator.\" Clearly these responses are inadequate. But they are worse than that. They are the responses of a madman or an idiot.\"\n \n\n \n Whether religious beliefs are important, held as sacred, provide emotional support or are widely held has no bearing on whether they are any more or less true. You are sidestepping the true issue once again.",

The \"revealed\" religionists have erected a strong wall to keep God-given reason out. Unfortunately, at the same time they're trying to keep reason out of their world. They're trying to make those of us who do not suffer from the irrational thinking of \"revealed\" religion behave as if we do.\n\n Not having read the entire ad (do you have a link?), I will comment only on the quoted statement: \"Hollingsworth asserts that slandering God should no longer be treated with tolerance or protected with the 'freedom of speech'\".\n \n Ridiculous!

Mencken, in American Mercury (March, 1930) \n \n\n \n and\n \n \nThe way to deal with superstition is not to be polite to it, but to tackle it with all arms, and so rout it, cripple it, and make it forever infamous and ridiculous. Is it, perchance, cherished by persons who should know better? Then their folly should be brought out into the light of day, and exhibited there in all its hideousness until they flee from it, hiding their heads in shame. \n True enough, even a superstitious man has certain inalienable rights. He has a right to harbor and indulge his imbecilities as long as he pleases, provided only he does not try to inflict them upon other men by force. He has a right to argue for them as eloquently as he can, in season and out of season. He has a right to teach them to his children. But certainly he has no right to be protected against the free criticism of those who do not hold them. He has no right to demand that they be treated as sacred. He has no right to preach them without challenge. \n -- H. L. Mencken, \"Aftermath\" (coverage of the Scopes Trial) The Baltimore Evening Sun, (September 14, 1925) \n \n",

   "... good does come out of religion sometimes, and enormous good at that...\n\n \n Well, it's a matter of looking at swings and roundabouts. I wouldn't argue that there are no positive aspects to religion. The issue to my mind is whether once all the accounts are rendered, once all the pluses and minuses are totted up, does religion end up in the black or the red with respect to its contribution to humanity. Would we on the whole be better off with it or without it? Is it beneficial, or is it and its encrusted institutions parasitical?\n \n Cui bono? Priests or laity? My money is on priests, and they are a minority. Religious, or rather spiritual belief may be beneficial to an individual, if they are inclined to it. Once it has become institutionalised, and priests are telling the laity what they can or cannot believe, who really benefits? The laity? I don't think so. Once you fit priests into the equation, we are talking parasitism.\n \n So it's a matter of swings and roundabouts, it's also a matter of how you define religion. If we are talking one person's deep spirituality, then yes, i can see the argument that religion might be beneficial. If we are talking Christian or Muslim religious institutions, I rather doubt it.\n \n Maybe we need to try and return religion to earlier and simpler roots, and turn our backs on the parasitic institutions that have throttled it.",
