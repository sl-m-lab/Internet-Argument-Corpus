   "Obvious to whom? More than half the world's Christians hold to the doctrine of transubstantiation.\n\n \n Another false Catholic doctrine.\n \n In his text, Systematic Theology, author Wayne Grudem addresses the Roman Catholic view of 'Transubstantiation:'\n \n \"According to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, the bread and wine actually become the body and blood of Christ. This happens at the moment the priest says, 'This is my body' during the celebration of the mass....When this happens, according to Roman Catholic teaching, grace is imparted to those present ex opere operato, that is, 'by the work performed,' but the amount of grace dispensed is in proportion to the subjective disposition of the recipient of grace.\" (Grudem 991)\n \n In addressing the supposed credibility of the Roman Catholic doctrine, Grudem goes on to say:\n \n \"In response to the Roman Catholic teaching on the Lord's Supper, it must be said that it first fails to recognize the symbolic character of Jesus' statements when he declared, 'This is my body,' or, 'This is my blood.' Jesus spoke in symbolic ways many times when speaking of himself. He said, for example, 'I am the true vine' (John 15:1), or 'I am the door' (John 10:9). In a similar way, when Jesus says, 'This is my body,' he means it in a symbolic way, not in an actual, literal, physical way.\" (Grudem 992)\n \n Also, paraphrasing Grudem, he notes that the view of transubstantiation would have the body of Christ being offered time and time again, contrary to what Hebrews teaches, \"Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly....Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many\" (Hebrews 9:25ff).\n \n Finally, if Transubstantion is supposed to occur at \"the moment the priest says, 'This is my body' during the celebration of the mass....,\" ask any one of the individuals chewing or drinking the non-symbolic body / blood of Christ to open their mouths and see if they have a pound of flesh or the wafer / wine they originally ate. It should be quite obvious then.",

   "Paul's instructions in 1 Corinthians 11 shed even more light on this matter: \n \n \"For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.\" 1 Corinthians 11:23-24 \n \n When Jesus said, \"Take, eat: this is my body,\" He was not suggesting that they reach out and begin eating His literal body.

Tell me why, if transubstantiation is so implausible, it was such a widely held belief in the early church and continues to be the majority belief amnog Christians.\n \n \n There's no evidence for the Catholic view of the eucharist in scripture, but there is some evidence against it. In Matthew 26:29, Jesus refers to the contents of the cup as \"this fruit of the vine\". It couldn't be wine, though, if transubstantiation had occurred. And Jesus refers to drinking the contents of the cup with His followers again in the kingdom to come. Yet, the eucharist apparently is to be practiced only until Jesus returns (1 Corinthians 11:26). If the cup in Matthew 26:29 contained transubstantiated blood, then why would Jesus refer to drinking that substance with His followers in the future, at a time when there would be no eucharist?\n \n Clement of Alexandria wrote the following about John 6 (emphasis added):\n \n Elsewhere the Lord, in the Gospel according to John, brought this out by symbols, when He said: \"Eat ye my flesh, and drink my blood,\" describing distinctly by metaphor the drinkable properties of faith and the promise, by means of which the Church, like a human being consisting of many members, is refreshed and grows, is welded together and compacted of both,--of faith, which is the body, and of hope, which is the soul; as also the Lord of flesh and blood. For in reality the blood of faith is hope, in which faith is held as by a vital principle. (The Instructor, 1:6)\n \n In another passage, Clement contradicts transubstantiation. He writes the following about how Christians should conduct themselves when drinking alcohol (emphasis added):\n \n In what manner do you think the Lord drank when He became man for our sakes? As shamelessly as we? Was it not with decorum and propriety? Was it not deliberately? For rest assured, He Himself also partook of wine; for He, too, was man. And He blessed the wine, saying, \"Take, drink: this is my blood\"--the blood of the vine. He figuratively calls the Word \"shed for many, for the remission of sins\"--the holy stream of gladness. And that he who drinks ought to observe moderation, He clearly showed by what He taught at feasts. For He did not teach affected by wine. And that it was wine which was the thing blessed, He showed again, when He said to His disciples, \"I will not drink of the fruit of this vine, till I drink it with you in the kingdom of my Father.\" [Matthew 26:29] But that it was wine which was drunk by the Lord, He tells us again, when He spake concerning Himself, reproaching the Jews for their hardness of heart: \"For the Son of man,\" He says, \"came, and they say, Behold a glutton and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans.\" (The Instructor, 2:2)\n \n http://members.aol.com/jasonte3/rceuch.htm",

The manifold and continual experience of the world in all ages, shows this is no evidence, that a man is not on the very brink of eternity, and that the next step will not be into another world. The unseen, unthought-of ways and means of persons going suddenly out of the world are innumerable and inconceivable. Unconverted men walk over the pit of hell on a rotten covering, and there are innumerable places in this covering so weak that they will not bear their weight, and these places are not seen. The arrows of death fly unseen at noon-day; the sharpest sight cannot discern them. God has so many different unsearchable ways of taking wicked men out of the world and sending them to hell, that there is nothing to make it appear, that God had need to be at the expense of a miracle, or go out of the ordinary course of his providence, to destroy any wicked man, at any moment. All the means that there are of sinners going out of the world, are so in God's hands, and so universally and absolutely subject to his power and determination, that it does not depend at all the less on the mere will of God, whether sinners shall at any moment go to hell, than if means were never made use of, or at all concerned in the case.\n \n \n Recommend you read the whole sermon.

   "Another false Catholic doctrine.\n\n Bizarrely, I'm going to have to say that you should have said \"Another false doctrine adhered to by Catholics, Orthodox and Copts\" (insofar as we all believe in the Body and Blood as real). It's just your criticism is itself flawed in being Western-centric, and thus a gross misunderstanding of teachings of the foundation church. Many Protestants naturally enough think only of a disagreement between Catholicism and themselves; Protestantism itself being a reaction against Catholicism.\n \n And then I'd argue against that. (see below).\n \n \nIn his text, Systematic Theology, author Wayne Grudem addresses the Roman Catholic view of 'Transubstantiation:'\n \n \"According to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, the bread and wine actually become the body and blood of Christ. This happens at the moment the priest says, 'This is my body' during the celebration of the mass....When this happens, according to Roman Catholic teaching, grace is imparted to those present ex opere operato, that is, 'by the work performed,' but the amount of grace dispensed is in proportion to the subjective disposition of the recipient of grace.\" (Grudem 991)\n \n In addressing the supposed credibility of the Roman Catholic doctrine, Grudem goes on to say:\n \n \"In response to the Roman Catholic teaching on the Lord's Supper, it must be said that it first fails to recognize the symbolic character of Jesus' statements when he declared, 'This is my body,' or, 'This is my blood.' Jesus spoke in symbolic ways many times when speaking of himself. He said, for example, 'I am the true vine' (John 15:1), or 'I am the door' (John 10:9). In a similar way, when Jesus says, 'This is my body,' he means it in a symbolic way, not in an actual, literal, physical way.\" (Grudem 992)\n \n Also, paraphrasing Grudem, he notes that the view of transubstantiation would have the body of Christ being offered time and time again, contrary to what Hebrews teaches, \"Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly....Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many\" (Hebrews 9:25ff).\n \n Finally, if Transubstantion is supposed to occur at \"the moment the priest says, 'This is my body' during the celebration of the mass....,\" ask any one of the individuals chewing or drinking the non-symbolic body / blood of Christ to open their mouths and see if they have a pound of flesh or the wafer / wine they originally ate. It should be quite obvious then.\n\n \n Orthodox don't have a 'formula' approach to this as Catholics do. We believe 'it is so'.\n \n I'll deal however with your mistakes one at a time\n \n Context in the Bible\n Jesus Himself said that He was real food. When questioned on this as in 'surely you must be joking' He reconfirmed the literalness of it...\n read...\n 6: 50 But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not die. 51I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If\n anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.\"\n 52Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, \"How can this man give us his flesh to eat?\" \n 53 Jesus said to them, \"I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in\n you. 54Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. 55For my flesh is real food\n and my blood is real drink. 56Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him. 57Just as the living Father sent me\n and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me.\n \n Note again the Jews took Him to mean a literal eating of His flesh, verse 52. Jesus confirms this interpretation. He says in truth. He says (55) &#8220;My\n flesh is real food and my blood is real drink&#8221;\n \n Paul reaffirms this in 1 Corinthians 11:17ff, where he specifies the difference between a &#8216;communal meal&#8217; and the Lord&#8217;s Supper.\n \n 1 Corinthians 11\n \n The Lord's Supper \n 17 In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. 18 In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. 19 No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval. 20 When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat, 21 for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk. 22 Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not! \n \n 23 For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, 24 and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.\" 25 In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.\" 26 For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. \n \n 27 Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. 28 A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. 29 For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself. 30 That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. 31 But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment. 32 When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world. \n \n 33 So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other. 34 If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. \n And when I come I will give further directions.\n \n \n \n Specifically you missed St. Paul saying it's not just a 'meal'\n \n 20 When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat\n \n \n \n It is NOT the \"Lord's Supper\". If you want to 'eat' a meal, do so at home...\n \n \n \n 21 for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk. 22 Don't you have homes to eat and drink in?\n \n \n \n He repeats that this was 'received' from Jesus\n \n 23 For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: \n \n \n \n Then in the same passage he repeats Jesus' words (having already said that it is NOT a 'combative meal'; the Lord's Supper)\n \n \n \n The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, 24 and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.\" 25 In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.\" \n \n \n \n And it has a sacred purpose...\n \n 26 For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. \n \n \n \n And He again associates it with the actual body and blood of Christ\n \n 27 Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. \n \n To sin against the body and blood you drink and eat is to sin against the very body and blood of Christ; they are alike. To sin against one is the same as to sin against the other...\n \n \n \n Most telling of all he says you must recognise this when you partake of them...\n \n 29 For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself. \n \n If you don't recognise that it's the body and blood of the Lord, you bring judgment upon yourself.\n \n \n \n And, he repeats again that it's not just a communal meal...\n \n 33 So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other. 34 If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. \n \n \n \n Context in the early church\n The earliest of Church writings repeat this\n St. Ignatius of Antioch wrote in his Epistle to the Smyrnaeans\n \n 6:2 But mark ye those who hold strange doctrine touching the grace of Jesus Christ which came to us, how that they are contrary to the mind of God. They have no care for love, none for the widow, none for the orphan, none for the afflicted, none for the prisoner, none for the hungry or thirsty.

Assemble yourselves together in common, every one of you severally, man by man, in grace, in one faith and one Jesus Christ, who after the flesh was of David's race, who is Son of Man and Son of God, to the end that ye may obey the bishop and presbytery without distraction of mind; breaking one bread, which is the medicine of immortality and the antidote that we should not die but live for ever in Jesus Christ.\n \n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/ignatius-ephesians-lightfoot.html\n \n \n \n Justin Martyr wrote in his First Apology...\n \n \"CHAPTER LXVI -- OF THE EUCHARIST. \n \n And this food is called among us Eukaristia [the Eucharist], of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are true, and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins, and unto regeneration, and who is so living as Christ has enjoined. For not as common bread and common drink do we receive these; but in like manner as Jesus Christ our Saviour, having been made flesh by the Word of God, had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh. For the apostles, in the memoirs composed by them, which are called Gospels, have thus delivered unto us what was enjoined upon them; that Jesus took bread, and when He had given thanks, said, \"This do ye in remembrance of Me, this is My body;\" and that, after the same manner, having taken the cup and given thanks, He said, \"This is My blood;\" and gave it to them alone. Which the wicked devils have imitated in the mysteries of Mithras, commanding the same thing to be done. For, that bread and a cup of water are placed with certain incantations in the mystic rites of one who is being initiated, you either know or can learn.\"\n \n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-firstapology.html\n \n \n \n See also CHAP. VIII of\n \n TERTULLIAN \n \n ON THE RESURRECTION OF THE FLESH.\n \n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian16.html\n \n \n \n As noted already, the early church was observed by pagans who thought that the Christian church were practicing cannibalism BECAUSE the Christians were partaking of the real flesh and blood of Christ...\n \n (see the article \"Why Early Christians Were So Despised\" at http://www.gospelcom.net/chi/GLIMPSEF/Glimpses/glmps139.shtml). It was a criticism of the pagans BECAUSE Christians explained that they were eating Christ's real Body!\n \n Miracles that are not apparently miracles....\n Creation. The world was created without clear signs (as yet) that it was created.\n \n Jesus Christ Himself showed no outward appearence of being God, yet He is/was fully God (For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form -Colossians 2:9)",

Through the activity of natural causes, God causes to arise those conditions required for the emergence and support of living organisms, and, furthermore, for their reproduction and differentiation. Although there is scientific debate about the degree of purposiveness or design operative and empirically observable in these developments, they have de facto favored the emergence and flourishing of life. Catholic theologians can see in such reasoning support for the affirmation entailed by faith in divine creation and divine providence. In the providential design of creation, the triune God intended not only to make a place for human beings in the universe but also, and ultimately, to make room for them in his own trinitarian life. Furthermore, operating as real, though secondary causes, human beings contribute to the reshaping and transformation of the universe.\" (paragraph 68)\n fom \"Communion and Stewardship: Human Persons Created in the Image of God,\" plenary sessions held in Rome 2000-2002, published July 2004\n cited at\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_and_the_Roman_Catholic_Church\n \n This is at odds with the 'offical' version which claims it can account for the rise of all species; through 'natural selection'... ie. no 'purposeful hand' was working there at all.\n \n \n And Catholics are told that there's no conflict between the 'theory of evolution' that is not based on materialism, i.e. the 'official theory'.\n \n For reference, have a look at\n Papal summit to debate Darwinian evolution\n http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2006/08/30/345032-papal-summit-to-debate-darwinian-evolution\n \n \n *-who not only created the universe, but the first creatures.",

   "First of all it is inaccurate to say that \"all those christians who believe every word in the bible is literal truth\" believe in transubstantiation (sp?). Catholics are the ones who believe in this, most of whom are not literalists. I assume you are speaking of the christians that you are refferring to most of the time which would be evangelical literalists, and none of these people believe in transubstantiation.\n But lets accept your premise. What exactly is your point Matthew?\n\n \n \n \n We have some biblical literalists that post on this site. My point is that if you believe the Bible to be literal. You know the creation story, the literal flood, that all humans are decended insestally from 2 people.There are sects of christians out there that believe that the Bible is litteral truth and every word is truth and historically literal. If this is so how can the same people believe that the bible is literal and yet believe that the body and blood are only symbolic especially when Jesus Himself said it was his actual body and blood that people are consuming?\n \n Besides on a side note if they can accuse gay people of being pediphiles then I can accuse them of being cannibals and unlike them I can use their beliefs and bible to back up my claim.",

   "Originally posted by Easyrider\n There's no evidence for the Catholic view of the eucharist in scripture, but there is some evidence against it. In Matthew 26:29, Jesus refers to the contents of the cup as \"this fruit of the vine\". It couldn't be wine, though, if transubstantiation had occurred. And Jesus refers to drinking the contents of the cup with His followers again in the kingdom to come. Yet, the eucharist apparently is to be practiced only until Jesus returns (1 Corinthians 11:26). If the cup in Matthew 26:29 contained transubstantiated blood, then why would Jesus refer to drinking that substance with His followers in the future, at a time when there would be no eucharist?\n\n \n \nPaul's instructions in 1 Corinthians 11 shed even more light on this matter: \n \n \"For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.\" 1 Corinthians 11:23-24 \n \n When Jesus said, \"Take, eat: this is my body,\" He was not suggesting that they reach out and begin eating His literal body. To even suggest such is ridiculous. He was speaking spiritually about what He was about to accomplish on the cross. \n \n Notice how that verse ends: \"...this do in remembrance of me.\" Observing the Lord's Supper is a remembrance of Christ's work at Calvary, not a reenactment. The same is true of Christ's blood: \n \n \"After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.\" 1 Corinthians 11:25 \n \n Jesus Himself taught the same lesson to his disciples at the Last Supper: \n \n \"And he (Jesus) took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.\" Luke 22:19 (chick.com)\n\n Ahh, but there is scriptural evidence of the Real Presence of Jesus' body, blood, soul, and divinity in scripture. John 6 is a major proof as Jo Bennett attests--see more comments below. But there is also evidence in 1 Corinthians 11. It is too bad that you and Jack Chick have been so selective and left out some very important verses. Right after your quotes above there is a very significant statement by Paul. Let's look at the verses in context:\n \n 1 Corinthians 11:23-30 \"For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that he Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, 'This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.\" In the same way also the cup, after supper, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.' For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For any one who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself. That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died.\"\n \n Paul knew that Jesus was bodily present in the Eucharist although he did not or may not have been able to precisely describe it. He knew that Jesus was more than just symbolically or spiritually present. He knew that a defilement of the Eucharist was a defilement of Jesus' body, a defilement incurring serious judgement. How does one \"profane the body and blood\" of the Lord in a symbol? How does one \"discern the body\" in a symbol? Can one eat and drink judgment upon himself in a symbolic act? Jesus instituted the Eucharistic meal as the New Covenant. It is more significant than a symbol.\n \n This is a very important topic for all Christians. The Eucharist is perhaps the strongest and most intimate uniting factor of Christians. Paul knew that unity came from sharing one bread: \n 1 Corinthians 10:16-17 \"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body for we all partake of the one bread.\"\n \n Perhaps when Jesus said that he would dwell in us and we in him, that he meant it in a very special way.\n \n \nThe fact is that transubstantiation isn't found in scripture. When Jesus said, \"Eat my flesh and drink my blood\" in John, no one was getting out their carving knives or taking that literally.\n\n Was there no controversy in John over the literal meaning of Jesus' words? I'm not sure if you have read the whole passage.\n \n 1.Why then did the Jews dispute among themselves concerning Jesus' words??? John 6: 52-Why would there be a dispute if they understood Jesus, if they understood him to be speaking symbolically?\n \n 2.If it was understood that Jesus was attempting to convey a symbolic teaching then why do his disciples say it is a \"hard saying?\" (John 6:60) If it is only symbolic/figurative language and especially symbolic/figurative language that was common and widely understood among Jews then what would be hard about it? \n \n 3.Why does he ask if it \"offends\" them? (John 6:61) What offense would a well understood figurative term be to those who understood it? \n \n 4.Finally, why do some leave him? (John 6:66)These people were already disciples of Jesus. They were already following many of his teachings. Yet, they left over a figurative assertion? \n \n 5. \"It is the Spirit that gives life, the flesh is of no avail; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life\" (John 6:63). If this is a confirmation by Jesus that he was speaking figuratively then why did the disciples still leave him after he said this (their leaving is described in verse 6:66)? It doesn't make sense that if he was clearing things up and affirming a figurative meaning that they would take offense and still leave? And the other clarification he makes also puts a puzzling spin on things. He clears up a misunderstanding on a well understood figure of speech by saying, \"truly, truly, my body is food indeed and my blood is drink indeed?\" Jesus clarifies this then disciples leave???\n \nClement of Alexandria wrote the following about John 6 (emphasis added):\n \n Elsewhere the Lord, in the Gospel according to John, brought this out by symbols, when He said: \"Eat ye my flesh, and drink my blood,\" describing distinctly by metaphor the drinkable properties of faith and the promise, by means of which the Church, like a human being consisting of many members, is refreshed and grows, is welded together and compacted of both,--of faith, which is the body, and of hope, which is the soul; as also the Lord of flesh and blood. For in reality the blood of faith is hope, in which faith is held as by a vital principle. (The Instructor, 1:6)\n \n In another passage, Clement contradicts transubstantiation. He writes the following about how Christians should conduct themselves when drinking alcohol (emphasis added):\n \n In what manner do you think the Lord drank when He became man for our sakes? As shamelessly as we? Was it not with decorum and propriety? Was it not deliberately? For rest assured, He Himself also partook of wine; for He, too, was man. And He blessed the wine, saying, \"Take, drink: this is my blood\"--the blood of the vine. He figuratively calls the Word \"shed for many, for the remission of sins\"--the holy stream of gladness. And that he who drinks ought to observe moderation, He clearly showed by what He taught at feasts. For He did not teach affected by wine. And that it was wine which was the thing blessed, He showed again, when He said to His disciples, \"I will not drink of the fruit of this vine, till I drink it with you in the kingdom of my Father.\" [Matthew 26:29] But that it was wine which was drunk by the Lord, He tells us again, when He spake concerning Himself, reproaching the Jews for their hardness of heart: \"For the Son of man,\" He says, \"came, and they say, Behold a glutton and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans.\" (The Instructor, 2:2)\n\n History is against you. The earliest Christians believed in the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist:\n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Real_Presence.asp\n \n \nFinally, if Transubstantion is supposed to occur at \"the moment the priest says, 'This is my body' during the celebration of the mass....,\" ask any one of the individuals chewing or drinking the non-symbolic body / blood of Christ to open their mouths and see if they have a pound of flesh or the wafer / wine they originally ate. It should be quite obvious then.\n\n Do not forget that there were many who did not recognize Jesus as Divine when he lived. So too, there are many who do not recognize Jesus' Real Presence in the Eucharist today. The Apostles recognized him after his Resurrection in the breaking of the bread and so should we--Luke 24:30 \"When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to them. And their eyes were opened and they recognized him...\" If God cannot perform this miracle today then he is and always has been powerless. \n \n New Testament miracles are often fulfillments of Old Testament typology. That is, there are real events and items in the Old Testament that foreshadow the coming of Jesus and are fulfilled in Jesus. As we know, he said he came to fulfill the law, not abolish it. In the treating the events of the Last Supper figuratively, there are two problems with Old Testament typology finding its fulfillment in New Testament events/items/miracles (as Rosalind Moss explains well in her tapes describing her Jewish conversion to Christianity, A Day of Grace):\n \n 1.For the first time ever, the Old testament type would point to a symbol and not to Jesus--that is, the manna as a type would point to another bread, which is a symbol of the bread from heaven, which then points to Jesus\n \n 2.The Old testament type would be greater than the new testament parallel fulfillment of that type. Manna was bread from heaven that gave the Jews life and sustenance by fulfilling the requirements of regular food. In your interpretation, the bread of the last supper would simply be a symbol instituted by Jesus, it would be regular bread, and again simple nutrition. It would not be something greater than the manna of old. It would actually be less than the manna of old for it would not even be bread coming from heaven directly from God. It would simply be earthly bread used as a symbol. So we see that the manna of the Old Testament cannot be greater than the Bread of Life of the New Testament. The Passover meal of the New Testament must be greater than the Passover meal of the Old Testament--a symbolic meal would not. Contrast this to the idea that Jesus fulfills the Old Testament type of the Lamb of God in becoming the ultimate and final sacrifice. Jesus became the Word of God living and inscribed in flesh, greater than the word of God inanimate and inscribed in the stone of the Commandments. Compare it to Jesus becoming the ultimate priest, prophet, and king. Jesus became the fulfillment of Adam (who was the first sinless man that gave life to all men and then fell) to being the only sinless man to live who gave eternal life to all men. Other examples of OT typology being fulfilled in a greater manifestation are the nation of Israel being transformed into the Church, Eve being fulfilled in Mary, etc.",

   "Are christians practicing Cannibalism? Are they teaching children Cannibalism?\n In communion you are being offered the body and blood of Jesus and they do teach this to children.\n\n From www.catholic.com:\n \n If we took Jesus' words literally, wouldn't that imply cannibalism? \n \n Cannibalism is when one individual physically eats the human flesh off of another's body. Catholic or not, the words in John 6 do sound cannibalistic. Even a Fundamentalist would have to say that he eats the flesh of Christ and drinks his blood in a symbolic manner so as to concur with the passage. By the same allowance, Catholics eat the flesh of Christ and drink his blood in a sacramental way. Neither the Protestant nor the Catholic appears to be doing anything cannibalistic, though.\n \n It would have been cannibalism is if a disciple two thousand years ago had tried literally to eat Jesus by sinking his teeth into his arm. Now that our Lord is in heaven with a glorified body and made present under the appearance of bread in the Eucharist, cannibalism is not possible. \n \n Catholics don't believe Jesus' presence in the Eucharist is such that the consumption of the Host entails cannibalism. Christ's body and blood aren't present naturally, but supernaturally, under the appearances of bread and wine. This mode of presence rules out cannibalism. \n \n It's accurate to say that while Christ's presence is real and substantial, the mode of consumption, the way in which we eat his body and drink his blood, is, in a sense, spiritual (though not merely symbolic). When the host is consumed, the physical process of eating affects only the accidents of bread, not the substance of Christ's body and blood, which are beyond our power to injure. \n \n Catholics, then, truly unite themselves spiritually to Christ who is really, substantially present, and they do so in a way which involves the bodily act of eating, even though the physical aspects of this process affect only the sign or accidents of bread.",
