Again, these women do not have a free choice in the matter.\n\n \n Just to provide some evidence of how incredibly shallow your liberal justifications and imaginings are, here's some light reading for you simone. It's from something called a book. emoticon_xdonno\n CHAPTER 9\n \n HEALTH\n \n MORE SPECIFICALLY, MENTAL HEALTH\n \n In discussing abortion, and abortion for the mother's health, it is absolutely crucial to know what \"health\" means, legally and in practice, regarding abortion. \"Health\" was defined in detail by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court said that abortion could be performed: \". . . in the light of all factors - physical, emotion-al, psychological, familial, and the woman's age - relevant to the well being of the patient. All these factors may relate to health.\" Roe vs. Wade, January 22, 1973\n \n And in its companion decision, \"Maternity or additional offspring may force upon the woman a distressful life and future. Psychological harm may be imminent. Mental and physical health may be taxed by childcare. There is also the distress for all concerned associated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically or otherwise, to care for it.\" Doe vs. Bolton, January 22, 1973 44\n \n In a concurring opinion, Justice Douglas further elaborated what \"health\" meant when, in law, it related to abortion. He detailed if she had to: \"endure the discomforts of pregnancy; to incur the pain, higher mortality rate, and aftereffects of childbirth; to abandon educational plans; to sustain loss of income; to forego the satisfactions of careers; to tax further mental and physical health in providing childcare, and in some cases, to bear the lifelong stigma of unwed motherhood.\" Roe vs. Wade, January 22, 1973\n \n This definition of \"health\" has been adopted internationally. As a result, in any nation, if abortion is al-lowed for the woman's \"health,\" that country permits abortion on demand unless other aspects of its laws add restrictions.\n \n The World Health Organization of the United Nations defined it as including social, emotional and economic well being of the woman as defined by the woman herself.\n \n Let's narrow it down to mental health, in the psychological sense, and ask-are there mental health reasons for abortion?\n \n No! The woman with mental health problems is far more likely to experience post-abortion emotional and psychological problems than a more stable woman.\n \n Four classic references here are these: \"Women with a history of psychiatric disturbance were three times as likely to have some psychiatric disturbance\" after an abortion as others who had no such history.\" E. Greenglass, \"Abortion & Psychiatric Disturbance,\" Canadian Psych. Assn. Jour., vol. 21, no. 7, Nov. 1976, pp. 453-459\n \n Dr. Charles Ford and his associates at UCLA reported the same finding. \"The more serious the psychiatric diagnosis, the less beneficial was the abortion.\" C. Ford et al., \"Abortion, Is It a Therapeutic Procedure in Psychiatry?\" JAMA, vol. 218, no. 8, Nov. 22, 1971, pp. 1173-1178\n \n \"The more severely ill the psychiatric patient, the worse is her post-abortion psychiatric state.\" E. Sandberg, \"Psychology of Abortion\" In Comprehensive Handbook of Psychiatry, 3rd ed. Kaplan & Friedman Publishers, 1980\n \n All of these support the original official statement of the World Health Organization in 1970: \"Serious mental disorders arise more often in women with previous mental problems. Thus, the very women for whom legal abortion is considered justified on psychiatric grounds are the ones who have the highest risk of post-abortion psychiatric disorders.\"\n \n Then \"mental illness\" as a reason for abortion is just an excuse?\n \n Precisely.\n \n What about psychological problems after abortion?\n \n When your authors wrote Handbook on Abortion in 1971, there were a few murmurings about post-abortion problems, but little was known. We then saw the negatives as mostly physical.\n \n When we wrote Abortion: Questions & Answers in 1985, physical damage, while still a major problem, was given less emphasis, and negative psychological aftermath was being seriously investigated. With the publication of this book, far more is known about what is now called Post Abortion Syndrome which clearly is a post traumatic stress syndrome.\n \n A Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome?\n \n Yes. This type of problem was first seen in large numbers in Vietnam veterans, but did not manifest it-self until a decade after they returned. The same ten-year delay has been evident with abortion. T. Keane, Vietnam Vets Trauma disorder level at 15%, Am. Med. News, L. Abraham, Dec. 2, 1988, p. 2\n \n What is Post Abortion Syndrome (PAS)?\n \n Many women are very ambivalent about getting aborted but do go ahead. Those around her told her (and she told herself) that it wouldn't bother her. When symptoms occur, she tells herself it can't be the abortion causing them, and then into play come her two major psychological defense mechanisms:\n \n Repression and Denial.\n \n For some this works successfully. For others it shades off to manageable distress, to severe and life-changing upset and even to suicide.\n \n There is a delay?\n \n Yes! Her initial response in most cases is a feeling of relief. Then, with repression and denial, she avoids the problem, usually for years -5 years is common, 10 or 20 not unusual.\n \n But then, for some, the negative feelings bubble up and break through. Often the precipitating event is: she has a baby, or a close friend or relative has a baby that she has close contact with. She finds out she is sterile, or other life-changing events.\n \n What are the symptoms of PAS?\n \n Guilt is ever present in many guises, along with regret, remorse, shame, lowered self-esteem, insomnia, dreams and nightmares, flash backs, anniversary reactions. There often is hostility, and even hatred, toward men. This can include her husband, and she may be-come sexually dysfunctional. Crying, despair and depression are usual, even at times with suicide attempts.\n \n Recourse to alcohol or drugs to mask the pain is frequent, sometimes leading to sexual promiscuity. There is also a numbing and coldness in place of more normal warmth and maternal tenderness.\n \n Is this due to religious guilt feelings?\n \n Perhaps in some it is a factor, but most women re-ported on in the early studies were unchurched at the time.\n \n Perhaps they had seen pictures of fetuses?\n \n Again, not most. Most did not know \"it\" was a \"baby\" when they aborted.\n \n But I've heard that the American Psychological Association says that PAS doesn't exist.\n \n This group has been strongly pro-abortion, and this definitely colors its thinking. But during the past decade or more, there have been dozens of national conferences on PAS. There are many professional articles and about 15 books adding more and more authentication to its existence and knowledge about it. Further, every one of the almost 4,000 pro-life pregnancy help centers in the U.S. now has found that an increasing percentage of their time is now devoted to treating PAS women.\n \n But so many studies deny PAS.\n \n True, and most are invalid for two reasons:\n \n (1) Timing: Most studies have investigated feelings for only a few weeks or months post abortion when she is still feeling relief that her problem is gone. Since the delay before PAS symptoms intrude is often 5 years or more, these studies are invalid.\n \n (2) Superficiality: Her repression and denial push this deep into her subconsciousness. If the survey is done by questionnaire or single interview, she routinely denies problems. These studies are invalid. Only by lengthy psychological testing and counseling can she often admit to some symptoms, much less tie them to the abortion she so desperately wants to forget.\n \n You mean most studies miss PAS?\n \n But most polls show few emotional problems - only a sense of relief! Yes, but \"What women really feel at the deepest level about abortion is very different from what they say in reply to questionnaires.\" A Canadian study polled a group of women who had previously completed a questionnaire in which they denied having problems from an abortion. One half of this group was randomly chosen for in-depth psychotherapy.\" What emerged from psychotherapy was in sharp contrast [to the questionnaires], even when the woman had rationally considered abortion to be inevitable, the only course of action.\" It was demonstrated that the conscious, rationalized decision for an abortion can co-exist with profound rejection of it at the deepest level. Despite surface appearances, abortion leaves behind deeper feelings \"invariably of intense pain, involving bereavement and a sense of identification with the foetus.\" I. Kent et al., \"Emotional Sequelae of Elective Abortion,\" British College of Med. Jour., vol. 20, no. 4, April 1978 I. Kent, \"Abortion Has Profound Impact,\" Family Practice News, June 1980, p. 80\n \n Are there valid studies?\n \n Yes, and two meta-analyses: James Rogers, who carefully examined over 400 published studies, pointed to the almost universal use of \"poor methodology and research design\" and \"grossly substandard power characteristics.\" He concluded that \"the question of psychological sequelae of abortion is not closed.\" J. Rogers et al., \"Validity of Existing Controlled Studies Examining the Psychological Sequelae of Abortion,\" Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith, vol. 39, no. 1, Mar. 1987, pp. 20-29 49\n \n Another concurred that existing research is methodologically flawed and that women who abort show more negative outcomes than those who deliver their babies. E. Posavac et al., \"Some Problems . . . Psychological Effects of Abortion,\" Psychology & Health, 5, 13-23\n \n How about specific studies?\n \n An excellent study thoroughly explaining and documenting PAS by the team that named this entity is:\n \n A. Speckhard & V. Rue, Post. Ab. Syndrome: An Emerging Public Health Concern, J. of Soc. Issues, vol. 48, no. 3, 1992 and E.J. Angelo, Psych. Sequelae of Abortion, Linacre Quart. vol. 59:2, May 1992 and P. Ney et al., Mental Health & Abortion, Psychiat. Jour., U. of Ottawa, vol. 14, no. 4, 1989 and L. DeVeber et al., Post Abortion Grief, Psychol. Sequel. of Ab., Humane Med., Vol. 7, no. 3, Aug. '91, p. 203\n \n Two excellent monographs are:\n \n J. Brende, Post-Trauma Sequelae..Abortion.., Trauma Rec. Pub., 458 Morning Glory Dr., Sparta, GA 31087\n \n V. Rue, Post Abortion Trauma, Life Dynamics, 1994, P.O. Box 185, Lewisville, TX 75067\n \n Also a quarterly newsletter from the Association for Interdisciplinary Research in Values & Social Change available from NRLC, 419 7th St. NW, Washington, DC 20004.\n \n Does it ever lead to suicide?\n \n Suicide is rare among pregnant women, but much more common after induced abortion. It is never re-ported under maternal mortality from abortion, of course, even though it is causative.\n \n \"The suicide rate after an abortion was three times the general suicide rate and six times that associated with birth.... the rate for women following a live birth was 5.9 per 100,000; following miscarriage 18.1; following abortion 34.7.\" They note that women frequently get short term \"post-natal blues after having a baby, but that this rarely translates into suicide, and that the initial stress of having a child is transitional, the over-all effect having a positive effect on women's health.\" M. Gissler, Abortion/Suicide Link,Br. Med. J., Dec. 6, 1996\n \n Then it is rare among pregnant women?\n \n In Abortion: Questions & Answers your authors de-tail 5 studies clearly showing this. One comment may suffice: \"The fetus in utero must be a protective mechanism. Perhaps women are reluctant to take another life with them when they do this.\"\n \n How about after abortion?\n \n In the above book your authors also give the findings of Suiciders Anonymous, and that: suicide post-abortion is several times more common than post-delivery. British Medical Jour., 1996\n \n What of Psychosis afterwards?\n \n This has not changed since Dr. M. Sims' original paper. He stated that, compared to post-delivery disturbances, post-abortion psychoses are much more serious, last longer, and are more likely to recur. They are more often the \"hard\" cases. M. Sim, \"Abortion and the Psychiatrist,\" British Med. Jour., vol. 2, 1963, pp. 145-148\n \n How about an example from a non-Christian culture?\n \n In Japan, where abortion has been legal and accepted for over four decades, a common custom is to conduct Mizuyo Kuyo services in honor of the god Jizo. This god has been made the patron saint of infants who died of starvation, abortion, or infanticide. Small baby statues, in his honor, are bought and dressed. Then, in a Buddhist Temple, rites of sorrow and reconciliation are carried out.\n \n Does abortion have any negative effects on her other children?\n \n In some cases a definite \"Survivor Syndrome\" has been demonstrated. Children usually know that mother is pregnant. They also know when she \"gets unpregnant.\" This may cause Survivor's Syndrome, similar to that of Jews who survived the holocaust. It is an irrational but real guilt at \"why was I saved and why were they killed.\" Dr. Ney has written about this. Dr. Edward Sheridan of Georgetown University has observed also a fear and mistrust of the mother. Originally, a small child, sensing a sibling's arrival, doesn't welcome it. \"When the baby suddenly disappears, the frightened child may get a warped sense of his own power to 'will people away.' Or, if he knows that his mother was an active agent in doing away with the sibling, he begins to fear her.\" A simple explanation of this was published in: L. Bond, \"The Surviving Sibling,\" Nat'l RTL News, Sept. 25, 1986.\n \n It is also closely associated with child abuse: Dr. Phillip Ney, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Christ Church, New Zealand, and of later at\n \n the University of Calgary, Canada, while still at the University of British Columbia, published a widely read study of this. His analysis clearly pointed to the fact that abortion (and its acceptance of the violence of killing the unborn) lowered a parent's psychic resistance to violence and abuse of the born. P. Ney, \"Relationship Between Abortion & Child Abuse,\" Canada Jour. Psychiatry, vol. 24, 1979, pp. 610-620\n \n Is there treatment for PAS?\n \n Yes, but it is not easy. We first must note that only a few doctors are sensitized to the necessary dynamics of treatment. Specifically, most psychiatrists and psychologists aren't much help, nor are psychotropic drugs. This requires a gradual healing process, and during it she must have ongoing close emotional support from one or several people who do not have to be trained professionals.\n \n As of the late 1990s, the place to start is your pro-life pregnancy help center. They can either work with her themselves and/or will know who can.\n \n Basically, there are five steps to the healing process:\n \n (1) Counter the denial. Bring this back into her consciousness and admit she was a party to killing her own baby.\n \n She must grieve over her lost child - tears, mourning as for another loved one.\n (3) Seek Divine forgiveness. This was not expected but seems essential for almost every woman.\n \n (4) Forgive others. Difficult, again, but some of this is needed to complete the healing and get rid of her long repressed anger.\n \n (5) Forgive herself. Not many get this far, but those who do have real inner peace. What is absolutely crucial at every step in the above is compassionate empathy, support and understanding from one or more persons around her. J. Willke, P.A.S.

   "APA report: Abortion is not a threat to women's mental health - Broadsheet - Salon.com\n APA report: Abortion is not a threat to women's mental health\n Can't say the same for all the quackery to the contrary. \n Lynn Harris\n \n Aug. 13, 2008 | This just in from the American Psychological Association: \"'Post-abortion syndrome,' post-smashmortion schmyndrome.\" \n \n According to the latest draft of its new report -- a comprehensive analysis of published English-language, peer-reviewed studies on the topic since 1989 -- abortion does not in and of itself pose a threat to women's mental health. \n \n Specifically: \"The most methodologically sound research indicates that among women who have a single, legal, first-trimester abortion of an unplanned pregnancy for nontherapeutic reasons, the relative risks of mental health problems are no greater than the risks among women who deliver an unplanned pregnancy.\" (\"Nontherapeutic\" as in elective; see Page 11 of the draft.) And: The prevalence of mental health problems observed among those women \"was consistent with normative rates of comparable mental health problems in the general population of women in the United States.\" (Note: The report draft was the most up-to-date version available at press time. APA associate executive director of communications Kim Mills told Broadsheet that the APA's governing body is expected to vote to accept a final draft later Wednesday morning.) \n \n Yes, the report acknowledges, some women may experience grief and sadness, even \"clinically significant ... depression and anxiety\" following an abortion. Of course some do. But, it notes, \"following an\" does not equal \"caused by.\" No smoking-gun study found more than correlation or persuasively separated abortion's emotional aftermath, such as it may be, from other co-occurring risk factors including poverty, exposure to violence and history of substance use. What does seem to predispose women to some degree of emotional fallout? Termination (for medical reasons, say) of a wanted pregnancy, pressure from others to end the pregnancy, and the perceived need to keep a termination secret because, ahem, of the stigma associated with abortion. \n \n Speaking of which, the report comes at a time when -- as noted in Tuesday's Wall Street Journal -- the focus of the abortion battle is shifting from \"what goes on inside a woman's womb\" to \"what goes on inside her head.\" Result: The prevailing \"abortion hurts women\" view now peddled by antiabortion advocates. WSJ paraphrase thereof: \"A woman may think she wants to end a pregnancy, may even feel relief when she does, but she will suffer for it later. So the state has a duty to stop her.\" (By the same reasoning, it has been noted, women -- what with the postpartum depression and all -- should be prevented from giving birth altogether.) \n \n This new approach is not just P.R. Studies (and \"studies\") of post-abortion psychological fallout have had serious legal impact of late. They helped abortion opponents, and the Supreme Court make the case (\"case\") that, as the WSJ puts it, \"the state must restrict abortion to protect women's mental health.\" State, as in South Dakota, for one, where a spanking-, and punishing, new mandate requires doctors to inform a woman seeking an abortion that she has \"an existing relationship\" with the fetus that is protected by the U.S. Constitution (this did not come up on \"Schoolhouse Rock\"!), that \"her existing constitutional rights with regard to that relationship will be terminated,\" and, fingers crossed behind back, that \"abortion increases the risk of suicide ideation and suicide.\" Antiabortion activists there are using the same view to drum up support for a broad abortion ban slated for the ballot in the fall. \n \n No abortion advocate will say that every woman who has an abortion does a jig and throws a party. (Nor, do I think, should anyone be cornered into solemn, self-evident, politically driven proclamations that abortion is a serious emotional decision, that women have feelings, etc., etc.) But interestingly, the WSJ notes that in 35 years of providing abortions, Susan Hill, a clinic director based in Raleigh, N.C., said \"she has noticed that 'women today need less counseling, less psychological care than they did in 1973,' when abortion was legalized but still carried an enormous stigma. Ms. Hill, who runs clinics in five southern states, has tried offering postprocedure counseling sessions -- but very few women show up, she said. 'They want to get past it and move on with their lives.'\" \n \n In any regard, there's something both repellent and dimly heartening about the abortion-hurts-women gambit and its perceived traction. Over under \"repellent\": #### you and your \"studies\" and all your contemptuous, contemptible -- and utterly transparent -- \"we care about WOMEN\" sanctimony. You were so much more convincing, sympathetic, even remotely defensible (at least on an individual level) when it was about saving babies. Over under \"dimly heartening\": We're the ones who've been on the rhetorical defensive ever since you guys trademarked the term \"life.\" But did you notice that you are the ones using our language now? Much as we've been criticized for \"making it about women\" when a potential human life hangs in the balance, well, as far as this shift in message is concerned, looks to me like we made it about women. \n \n \n -- Lynn Harris",

   "Even pro-abortion advocates have admitted the problem. To just disregard this syndrome out of hand is an attempt to be blatantly deceptive.\n Pro-choice Researchers Acknowledge Existence of Post Abortion Syndrome (AGP,8/2000) \n Researchers writing in the Archives of General Psychiatry [Aug 2000] have acknowledged that some women experience post-abortion syndrome (PASS). The research team, led by Dr. Brenda Major, diagnosed PASS among 1.4 percent of a sample of women who had abortions two years previously.\n \n \"Even at the low rate identified in this study, the impact is tremendous,\" said Dr. Vincent Rue, who first proposed PASS as a variant of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 1981.\n \n \"With 40 million abortions since 1972,\n \n this would translate into 560,000 cases of PASS.\" \n \n [581,000 cases as of 1/2004]\n \n Rue also notes that many women in the study reported psychiatric disorders that are less severe than full-blown PAS. Twenty percent of the women in the Majors study experienced clinical depression.\n \n When asked if they would do it all over again, 31 percent reported that they would not have chosen abortion or were uncertain. \"Since ambivalence is a good predictor of post-abortion problems, \" said Rue, \"it is likely that many of these women are having post-abortion symptoms that simply fall short of full-blown PAS.\"\n \n Dr. David Reardon, who directs a post-abortion research & education organization, the Elliot Institute, notes: \"Clearly, this study shows that abortionists should be screening for a history of depression,\" he said.\n \n \"It also confirms a large body of earlier research that shows that prior psychological problems are more likely to be made worse by abortion, not better...The biggest shortcomings of this study are the high dropout and refusal rates,\" he said.\n \n \"Even though women were offered payment to participate, 15 percent of the women who were initially approached refused to participate, and 50 percent of those who originally participated refused to participate in follow-up interviews. Research has found that those women who are most likely to experience negative post-abortion reactions are also least likely to participate in post-abortion research.\"\n \n This criticism is supported by a recent study which found that women who declined to participate in post-abortion follow-up interviews most closely matched the characteristics of those women who experienced the most post-abortion distress.\n \n Dr. Hanna S\u00f6derberg, the lead author of that study, reported that \"for many of the women, the reason for non-participation seemed to be a sense of guilt and remorse that they did not wish to discuss. An answer very often given was: 'I do not want to talk about it. I just want to forget'.\"\n \n Conducting interviews one year after the abortions, S\u00f6derberg's research team found that approximately 60 percent of the women in their sample of 854 women had experienced emotional distress after their abortions. This distress was classified as \"severe,\" warranting professional psychiatric attention, among 16 percent of the women.\n \n In addition, S\u00f6derberg's research team noted that over 70 percent stated that they would never consider an abortion again if they faced an unwanted pregnancy.\n \n Majors found that negative feelings and dissatisfaction with the abortion decision increased with time - even among her final, lower-risk population.\n \n In addition, only a minority of women reported positive emotions, and on average the women reported no beneficial effect from their abortions. This general ambivalence about their abortions, combined with a trend toward increasing negative reactions, contradicts the claim that abortion is generally beneficial to women.\" \n \n Though Major and her colleagues focused mostly on the psychological effects of abortion, they also found that 17 percent of women experienced physical problems such as bleeding or pelvic infection associated with the abortion. \"This rate is much higher than abortion providers admit,\" Rue said. \"Clinic counselors rarely inform women of this rate of physical complications.\"\n \n (August 24, 2000) Contacts:\n a) Dr. David C.

   "APA report: Abortion is not a threat to women's mental health - Broadsheet - Salon.com\n APA report: Abortion is not a threat to women's mental health\n Can't say the same for all the quackery to the contrary. \n Lynn Harris\n \n Aug. 13, 2008 | This just in from the American Psychological Association: \"'Post-abortion syndrome,' post-smashmortion schmyndrome.\" \n \n According to the latest draft of its new report -- a comprehensive analysis of published English-language, peer-reviewed studies on the topic since 1989 -- abortion does not in and of itself pose a threat to women's mental health. \n \n Specifically: \"The most methodologically sound research indicates that among women who have a single, legal, first-trimester abortion of an unplanned pregnancy for nontherapeutic reasons, the relative risks of mental health problems are no greater than the risks among women who deliver an unplanned pregnancy.\" (\"Nontherapeutic\" as in elective; see Page 11 of the draft.) And: The prevalence of mental health problems observed among those women \"was consistent with normative rates of comparable mental health problems in the general population of women in the United States.\" (Note: The report draft was the most up-to-date version available at press time. APA associate executive director of communications Kim Mills told Broadsheet that the APA's governing body is expected to vote to accept a final draft later Wednesday morning.) \n \n Yes, the report acknowledges, some women may experience grief and sadness, even \"clinically significant ... depression and anxiety\" following an abortion. Of course some do. But, it notes, \"following an\" does not equal \"caused by.\" No smoking-gun study found more than correlation or persuasively separated abortion's emotional aftermath, such as it may be, from other co-occurring risk factors including poverty, exposure to violence and history of substance use. What does seem to predispose women to some degree of emotional fallout? Termination (for medical reasons, say) of a wanted pregnancy, pressure from others to end the pregnancy, and the perceived need to keep a termination secret because, ahem, of the stigma associated with abortion. \n \n Speaking of which, the report comes at a time when -- as noted in Tuesday's Wall Street Journal -- the focus of the abortion battle is shifting from \"what goes on inside a woman's womb\" to \"what goes on inside her head.\" Result: The prevailing \"abortion hurts women\" view now peddled by antiabortion advocates. WSJ paraphrase thereof: \"A woman may think she wants to end a pregnancy, may even feel relief when she does, but she will suffer for it later. So the state has a duty to stop her.\" (By the same reasoning, it has been noted, women -- what with the postpartum depression and all -- should be prevented from giving birth altogether.) \n \n This new approach is not just P.R. Studies (and \"studies\") of post-abortion psychological fallout have had serious legal impact of late. They helped abortion opponents, and the Supreme Court make the case (\"case\") that, as the WSJ puts it, \"the state must restrict abortion to protect women's mental health.\" State, as in South Dakota, for one, where a spanking-, and punishing, new mandate requires doctors to inform a woman seeking an abortion that she has \"an existing relationship\" with the fetus that is protected by the U.S. Constitution (this did not come up on \"Schoolhouse Rock\"!), that \"her existing constitutional rights with regard to that relationship will be terminated,\" and, fingers crossed behind back, that \"abortion increases the risk of suicide ideation and suicide.\" Antiabortion activists there are using the same view to drum up support for a broad abortion ban slated for the ballot in the fall. \n \n No abortion advocate will say that every woman who has an abortion does a jig and throws a party. (Nor, do I think, should anyone be cornered into solemn, self-evident, politically driven proclamations that abortion is a serious emotional decision, that women have feelings, etc., etc.) But interestingly, the WSJ notes that in 35 years of providing abortions, Susan Hill, a clinic director based in Raleigh, N.C., said \"she has noticed that 'women today need less counseling, less psychological care than they did in 1973,' when abortion was legalized but still carried an enormous stigma. Ms. Hill, who runs clinics in five southern states, has tried offering postprocedure counseling sessions -- but very few women show up, she said. 'They want to get past it and move on with their lives.'\" \n \n In any regard, there's something both repellent and dimly heartening about the abortion-hurts-women gambit and its perceived traction. Over under \"repellent\": #### you and your \"studies\" and all your contemptuous, contemptible -- and utterly transparent -- \"we care about WOMEN\" sanctimony. You were so much more convincing, sympathetic, even remotely defensible (at least on an individual level) when it was about saving babies. Over under \"dimly heartening\": We're the ones who've been on the rhetorical defensive ever since you guys trademarked the term \"life.\" But did you notice that you are the ones using our language now? Much as we've been criticized for \"making it about women\" when a potential human life hangs in the balance, well, as far as this shift in message is concerned, looks to me like we made it about women. \n \n \n -- Lynn Harris\n\n \n When shibboleths and sanctimony is all you have, it's hard to go with anything like contemporary research. Good post.",

   "WS, have you ever spoken with a woman who has had an abortion?\n \n I should think that almost all women would regard choosing an abortion as a very grave decision. that they would carefully weigh the pros and cons of choosing such a thing.\n \n Most women are greatly troubled by the NECESSITY  of making such a decision, the necessity of poverty, a career (women are gravely injured professionally if their career progress is interrupted by pregnancy, childbirth and family responsibilities, more on this later), health considerations, other family responsibilities which cannot be jeopardized by a pregnancy, the risk of childbirth, and the responsibilities of another child.\n \n In regard to the career options for women, women are highly penalized in the United States, a nation which is not all family friendly. Family unfriendliness has been the trend from during and since the Reagan administration, which was particularly hateful to the American family.\n \n I can remember from before Reagan, when it was possible for American families to have only one breadwinner in a family, when Americans were not having their jobs outsourced to another nations, when health care was more affordable before the health insurance industry and the pharma industry got their claws into America and created health care for profit, extreme profit.\n \n I saw many Americans becoming jobless and homeless as a result of Reagan's economic policies.",

Men And Abortion : Home\n \n \nEven pro-abortion advocates have admitted the problem. To just disregard this syndrome out of hand is an attempt to be blatantly deceptive.\n Pro-choice Researchers Acknowledge Existence of Post Abortion Syndrome (AGP,8/2000) \n Researchers writing in the Archives of General Psychiatry [Aug 2000] have acknowledged that some women experience post-abortion syndrome (PASS). The research team, led by Dr. Brenda Major, diagnosed PASS among 1.4 percent of a sample of women who had abortions two years previously.\n \n \"Even at the low rate identified in this study, the impact is tremendous,\" said Dr. Vincent Rue, who first proposed PASS as a variant of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 1981.\n \n \"With 40 million abortions since 1972,\n \n this would translate into 560,000 cases of PASS.\" \n \n [581,000 cases as of 1/2004]\n \n Rue also notes that many women in the study reported psychiatric disorders that are less severe than full-blown PAS. Twenty percent of the women in the Majors study experienced clinical depression.\n \n When asked if they would do it all over again, 31 percent reported that they would not have chosen abortion or were uncertain. \"Since ambivalence is a good predictor of post-abortion problems, \" said Rue, \"it is likely that many of these women are having post-abortion symptoms that simply fall short of full-blown PAS.\"\n \n Dr. David Reardon, who directs a post-abortion research & education organization, the Elliot Institute, notes: \"Clearly, this study shows that abortionists should be screening for a history of depression,\" he said.\n \n \"It also confirms a large body of earlier research that shows that prior psychological problems are more likely to be made worse by abortion, not better...The biggest shortcomings of this study are the high dropout and refusal rates,\" he said.\n \n \"Even though women were offered payment to participate, 15 percent of the women who were initially approached refused to participate, and 50 percent of those who originally participated refused to participate in follow-up interviews. Research has found that those women who are most likely to experience negative post-abortion reactions are also least likely to participate in post-abortion research.\"\n \n This criticism is supported by a recent study which found that women who declined to participate in post-abortion follow-up interviews most closely matched the characteristics of those women who experienced the most post-abortion distress.\n \n Dr. Hanna S\u00f6derberg, the lead author of that study, reported that \"for many of the women, the reason for non-participation seemed to be a sense of guilt and remorse that they did not wish to discuss. An answer very often given was: 'I do not want to talk about it. I just want to forget'.\"\n \n Conducting interviews one year after the abortions, S\u00f6derberg's research team found that approximately 60 percent of the women in their sample of 854 women had experienced emotional distress after their abortions. This distress was classified as \"severe,\" warranting professional psychiatric attention, among 16 percent of the women.\n \n In addition, S\u00f6derberg's research team noted that over 70 percent stated that they would never consider an abortion again if they faced an unwanted pregnancy.\n \n Majors found that negative feelings and dissatisfaction with the abortion decision increased with time - even among her final, lower-risk population.\n \n In addition, only a minority of women reported positive emotions, and on average the women reported no beneficial effect from their abortions. This general ambivalence about their abortions, combined with a trend toward increasing negative reactions, contradicts the claim that abortion is generally beneficial to women.\" \n \n Though Major and her colleagues focused mostly on the psychological effects of abortion, they also found that 17 percent of women experienced physical problems such as bleeding or pelvic infection associated with the abortion. \"This rate is much higher than abortion providers admit,\" Rue said. \"Clinic counselors rarely inform women of this rate of physical complications.\"\n \n (August 24, 2000) Contacts:\n a) Dr. David C.

A similar discriminatory policy was John Howard's contribution to Australia's foreign aid in 1996.\n Last year, with encouragement from a cross-parliamentary committee the Labor government nearly conceded lifting the ban on Australian aid, but with typical decisiveness and clear-mindedness, the matter was referred to a government committee for resolution. \n Just to demonstrate how stupid our policy is, it applies even in countries where abortion is legal. So if a pregnant woman wants a legally available abortion, the health clinics can't help her at risk of losing funding they receive from Australia. \n However, she can receive Australian aid funded assistance if she has had an unsafe abortion.\n This policy contradicts the WHO reproductive health guidelines , and also contradicts an international comittment Australia has signed up to that says \"in circumstances where abortion is not against the law, health systems should train and equip health service providers and should take other measures to ensure that abortion is safe and accessible\". \n Now Australia is the only country in the world that imposes this harsh restriction on its overseas aid funding.",

So we are talking about a human being playing God (Goddess?) with another human being (in gestation).\n We are not talking about a woman wanting to get a limb amputated, which is part of her body, but killing a separate human being (in gestation).\n \n Why is not a crime to kill someone when she/he is on the inside of the birth canal but it is a crime to kill her/him when he/she is on the outside?",
