   "An acceptance of YEC IS NOT A SALVATION ISSUE WHICH DETERMINES IF ONE ACTUALLY KNOWS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST ON A PERSONAL BASIS IN ANY WAY.\nThis surprised me a bit. I'll post why.\n \n [NB: In anticipation of Archie accusing me of 'ripping his posts out of context to meet my personal secularist/humanist agenda', I'd just say this: I honestly believed that Archie assumed all 'true' Christians must, by necessity, be YEC-ers. Not necessarily from these particular quotes - they're just examples (the problem with boasting '8000+ posts' is that finding something specific is increasingly needle-in-haystack), but from his general attitude. If you feel I'm taking posts 'out of context' - feel free to provide some!]\n \n Without further ado... From this post, we have:\n \n \n[to Matthew, a Christian 'evolutionist']\n But you know that your positions are unsupportable according to the bible you claim to accept on the one hand but oppose in every debate in which you support whatever view opposes the scriptural perspective. And what I find so sad is that you seem blind to the fact that if you're not for God, then you are against Him. \nAnd from the same post (separated for emphasis):\n[still talking to Matthew]You just posted on another thread that even if evolution was proven wrong, that doesn't mean that another natural method for our existence apart from creation isn't how we got here.\n \n I find that opinion incredible coming from a believer who say's he has a personal relationship with the God of the Genesis account in the bible. But you can't even see the hypocrisy in your inconsistent position.\n\n \n Elsewhere, is this post. To quote again:\n \nIsn't it possible that evolution is a system created by god?\nI don't believe it is DrNo, because by its very definition evolution claims that Man evolved from the lower animals. It relegates us to nothing more than a biological organism with no more value than an viral bacteria.\n \n Another problem you run into regarding Genesis is the spiritual relationship Man has with God and Adams fall from grace. Evolution erases that relationship which erases the need for the need for being reunited with God through the shed blood of Christ on the Cross.\n \n Also, you must redefine what evolution teaches altogether in order to credit God with original creation and then assume evolution is His plan for humanity. That's why the evolutionists are rejecting your premise out of hand. Your version of it is a sacrilege because it goes from being Natural to Supernatural if God is credited with original Creation.\n\n \n Elsewhere again, this post:\n \nI personally know my God is alive and well and is not a liar. Therefore, even though I never personally observed what He say's about the 6 day creation event, I know He is trustworthy in His word and deed. Can you say the same about the men who's science you follow? I think not.\n\n \n I could go on (simply do a search for posts by Archangel in the Creationism forum containing the term 'relationship'), but I think this makes the point sufficiently. Archie thinks:\n 'Evolution' is directly contradicted by the bible.\n By having a personal relationship with God, you know intrinsically that the Bible is totally true.\n To say that there is a third alternative (other than evo or YEC) is ridiculous if you have a 'personal relationship with God'.\n \n I'm finding it hard to see how Archie thinks that a 'true' Christian can not be a YEC-er.\n \n EDIT: One more, from this post. Quotes nested for context.\nSo Christianity isn't a religion my friend, it's a relationship with a living God who created us in His image, with free will for willing fellowship with Him as His children who have the choice, but choose to be with Him.\nMaybe so, but what does that relationship have to do with literalism in the interpretation of the Biblical creation story?\nEverything. If the Genesis account is false then the whole bible is a mythical story with no real relevance to humanities fall from grace and eventual redemption through Jesus sacrifice on the Cross. If you really understood the consistency of the bible, you would understand this.\n ...\n So if evolution is correct, no matter how pseudo christians attempt to marry the two belief systems, if Christ did not rise from the dead, the gospel is useless and our faith is in vain as Paul put it so eloquently.\n\n To summarise, then. Archie thinks:\n 1. It is impossible to be an 'evolutionist' and a 'true' Christian.\n 2. It is impossible for a 'true' Christian to believe that there is a third option (other than YEC or evolution).\n \n 3. (From 1 and 2) All 'true' Christians must believe in YEC - or have no opinion on the matter (never thought about it).",

From this post, we have:\n \n And from the same post (separated for emphasis):\n \n Elsewhere, is this post. To quote again:\n \n \n Elsewhere again, this post:\n \n \n I could go on (simply do a search for posts by Archangel in the Creationism forum containing the term 'relationship'), but I think this makes the point sufficiently. Archie thinks:\n 'Evolution' is directly contradicted by the bible.\n By having a personal relationship with God, you know intrinsically that the Bible is totally true.\n To say that there is a third alternative (other than evo or YEC) is ridiculous if you have a 'personal relationship with God'.\n \n I'm finding it hard to see how Archie thinks that a 'true' Christian can not be a YEC-er.\n \n EDIT: One more, from this post. Quotes nested for context.\n To summarise, then. Archie thinks:\n 1. It is impossible to be an 'evolutionist' and a 'true' Christian.\n 2. It is impossible for a 'true' Christian to believe that there is a third option (other than YEC or evolution).\n \n 3. (From 1 and 2) All 'true' Christians must believe in YEC - or have no opinion on the matter (never thought about it).\n\n \n Good post ian, you captured some good exchanges and some very important distinctions I made between believers and non-believers. Regarding the bolded sentence above though, And your whole opinion for that matter, please show where we were even discussing YEC rather than the Genesis account in general? I was having a discussion with Matthew regarding his defense of secular humanism in every debate as he simultaneously claimed to be a bible believing christian. \n \n This wasn't a debate about evolution at all. It was referred to only as an example of how he is on the other side of everything the bible stands for. I never said anywhere in that or any other thread that a person must be a YECer in order to be saved, and I notice you never posted me saying that. My debate on that thread was all about trusting the word of God rather than Man. I invite all observers to click on the thread titles on the top right hand corner of any links you posted after opening them, and reading the debates in context.",

How can two 'true' Christians disagree on YEC, given that both are guided by their 'personal relationship with God'? How might such a disagreement be resolved?\n\n \n It's as I said above ian, believing or not believing in YEC is a matter of personal faith and not a salvation issue. Here is how the bible puts it, which is the ruler by which we measure issues of doctrine and individual enlightenment.\n \n Eph 4:6 one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.\n Eph 4:7 But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gift.\n Eph 4:8 Therefore it says, \"WHEN HE ASCENDED ON HIGH, HE LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF CAPTIVES, AND HE GAVE GIFTS TO MEN.\"\n \n Rom 12:3 For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.\n You see? God gives us all a measure of faith and light which becomes stronger with growth in him hopefully, if a believer continues to grow spiritually that is. When I was newly born again, I didn't have the understanding I do now, but I still believed by faith that Gods word was true. But not all new believers have that degree of faith from the outset as I did.\n \n What is relevant though regarding the issue of salvation is that a believer is eternally tied to God via that crimson chord of Christ's shed blood which is unbreakable unless the believer himself commands Gods Holy Spirit out of him. \n \n Your belief that God is a brutal taskmaster who demands that we understand, comprehend and accept every aspect of the bible simultaneously at the moment of our rebirth is not accurate at all. God understands our limited vision and understanding regarding the unprovable things in the bible, and the deceptions which this world creates in order to draw us away from Him.\n \n My issues with Matthew were all about him siding with the secular humanists against what the bible states in every single religious debate he commented on. I don't expect every believer in Christ to agree with my perspective on every spiritual issue in the bible. And I don't declare them unsaved for believing in the pre trib rapture or even Old Earth Creationism. But the quotes you are relying on are about a poster claiming to be a christian when he never once agreed with or sided with me on any spiritual issue at all. He didn't even agree on how to be saved. \n \n So my disagreements with Matthew weren't about him opposing me at every turn, they were about Him opposing Gods word which he claimed to believe and comprehend at every turn. The bottom line is that nobody who possesses the Holy Spirit within them can reject every single major spiritual principle out of hand as Matthew does.",

   " To accept the secular humanist explanation for our origins is truly grasping at straws and every believer will grasp the shallowness of that with maturity and spiritual growth, but at their own time of course.\n\n \n Largely because you do not understand the basics of why people think that way. Accepting YEC equates to a liar God. An educated Christian would understand this and see how YEC requires God either to have lied in the Bible or to be lying to us every second of our lives as we live them in the natural world. You yourself are living a lie. You rejected radiometric dating on its very principles yet you likely use nuclear power which relies on the same principles. That kind of thinking makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.\n \n Is Young Earth Creationism a Heresy?\n \n \n When confronted with three solid reasons why the Earth is old, young-Earth creationists will say \"That's just how God made it\", but therein lies a problem - a very big problem. If the Earth was, indeed, made in a single, supernatural act 10,000 years ago, then God, for some reason, left behind as part of the record of His creation these isotopic abundances, measurable rates of the movement of the Pacific and Atlantic Plates, and two valid methods of age determination, all of which show beyond any doubt that it was not created in a supernatural act some 10,000 years ago.\n \n Ask yourself, \"Why would God leave evidence that speaks against the actual record?\" We may say that God can do things in anyway that He desires. God chose to be self-limiting. He is the God of order and laws such as gravity. God is good, just and truthful. This allows humans to trust a world that makes sense.\n \n The final determination that must be made is that the record of nature, being God's record, is trustworthy as God has chosen not to lie to us. To say that He would lie would impart a most profound deviousness to God, which would be heresy. Therefore the only possible conclusion we can reach is that the Earth is old - very old.\n \n All the \"appearance of age\" arguments made by young-Earth creationists to try to explain away the evidences of an old Earth are equally heretical. God did not put false clues under our feet to trick us. He gave us clues to show us His true creation and the way He did it. If God took 4.5 billion years to create the Earth, then so be it. It is far more in line with a firm faith to believe in a God-created old Earth than to believe that a devious god is trying to trick us into not believing in a supernatural creation.\n\n \n YEC requires a liar God. How can someone be a Christian when their origin belief mandates that their God is deceptive? Is that not a trait of Satan, not God?",
