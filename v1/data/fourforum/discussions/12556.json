   "In November 1993, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 (Brady Act), Public Law 103-159, was signed into law requiring Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) to request background checks on prospective firearm transferees. The permanent provisions of the Brady Act, which went into effect on November 30, 1998, required the U.S. Attorney General to establish the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) so that any FFL may contact by telephone, or by other electronic means, for information to be supplied immediately, on whether the transfer of a firearm would violate Section 922 (g) or (n) of Title 18, United States Code (U.S.C.), or state law. \n \n Search Results - THOMAS (Library of Congress)\n \n Firearms and Explosives | Business.gov",

   "I just read the cited rawstory.com article by someone named John Byrne. In that article I read the following:\n \n &#8220;Seven million people have applied for criminal background checks since November in an effort to buy guns, according to the FBI. That figure doesn't include Virginia, whose gun shows don't require any background checks.&#8221;\n \n This is a false statement. Mr. Byrne is either ignorant of the law, or he is attempting to deliberately mislead the reader. \n \n Federal law applies in the Commonwealth of Virginia just as it does in other states, and every law regulating guns applies equally, whether or not at a gun show. There simply is no &#8220;gun show loophole&#8221; (in either the Federal Code or the Code of Virginia). I have previously posted Virginia law on this topic. Here now is the federal law and how it applies (items in italics are from the actual code&#8212;all else is my comment):\n \n Firearms &#8220;dealers&#8221; defined:\n \n 18 U.S. C. 921: The term \"dealer\" means (A) any person engaged in the business of selling firearms at wholesale or retail, (B) any person engaged in the business of repairing firearms or of making or fitting special barrels, stocks, or trigger mechanisms to firearms, or (C) any person who is a pawnbroker. The term \"licensed dealer\" means any dealer who is licensed under the provisions of this chapter. The term \"pawnbroker\" means any person whose business or occupation includes the taking or receiving, by way of pledge or pawn, of any firearm as security for the payment or repayment of money.\n \n 18 U. S. C. 922: No person shall engage in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in firearms, or importing or manufacturing ammunition, until he has filed an application with and received a license to do so from the Secretary. Therefore, every person who is a &#8220;dealer&#8221; of firearms must first obtain a Federal Firearms License (FFL). \n \n 18 U.S.C. 922 further contains a requirement that all FFL dealers are primarily required to conduct business at a specific location described in their permit application. \n \n 18 U.S.C. 924: Regardless of location (ie. whether or not at a gun show), acting as a firearms &#8220;dealer&#8221; without being licensed is a felony offense punished by up to 5 years imprisonment. \n \n Authority for licensed dealers to sell at gun shows:\n \n 18 U.S.C. 922: A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer may, under rules or regulations prescribed by the Secretary, conduct business temporarily at a location other than the location specified on the license if such temporary location is the location for a gun show or event sponsored by any national, State, or local organization, or any affiliate of any such organization devoted to the collection, competitive use, or other sporting use of firearms in the community, and such location is in the State which is specified on the license. Records of receipt and disposition of firearms transactions conducted at such temporary location shall include the location of the sale or other disposition and shall be entered in the permanent records of the licensee and retained on the location specified on the license. Nothing in this subsection shall authorize any licensee to conduct business in or from any motorized or towed vehicle.\n \n Licensed dealers are required to conduct background checks for all sales&#8212;regardless of where the guns are sold:\n \n 18 U.S.C. 922: Beginning on the date that is 30 days after the Attorney General notifies licensees under section 103(d) of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act that the national instant criminal background check system is established (that date was December 30, 1998&#8212;and proved a rare occurrence of the Brady Campaign and the NRA agreeing on a piece of legislation&#8212;Bryan), a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer shall not transfer a firearm without first conducting a background check and receiving authorization to sell or transfer the firearm. This applies no matter whether the dealer is selling from his business location or at a gun show. A violation of this provision is a felony punished by up to 10 years imprisonment.\n \n Who cannot have guns under federal law:\n \n 18 U.S.C. 922: A person is prohibited from purchasing, possessing, or transporting firearms if he: (1) is under indictment for, or has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; (2) is a fugitive from justice; (3) is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802)); (4) has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution; (5) who, being an alien - (A) is illegally or unlawfully in the United States; or (B) except as provided in subsection (y)(2), has been admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant visa (as that term is defined in section 101(a)(26) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(26))); (6) has been discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions; (7) who, having been a citizen of the United States, has renounced his citizenship; (8) is subject to a court order that restrains such person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner of such person or child of such intimate partner or person, or engaging in other conduct that would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or child, except that this paragraph shall only apply to a court order that - (A) was issued after a hearing of which such person received actual notice, and at which such person had the opportunity to participate; and (B)(i) includes a finding that such person represents a credible threat to the physical safety of such intimate partner or child; or (ii) by its terms explicitly prohibits the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against such intimate partner or child that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury; or (9) has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. \n \n No person fitting one of the 9 categories above may purchase, possess, or transport a firearm:\n \n 18 U.S. C. 922 It shall be unlawful for any person (who fits into one of the 9 categories described earlier) to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. This law applies everywhere, and prohibited persons have no more legal right to purchase or possess firearms at a gun show than they do anywhere else. A violation of this provision is a felony punished by up to 10 years imprisonment.\n \n No person, dealer or otherwise, may transfer any firearm to a person prohibited from having a firearm: \n \n 18 U.S.C. 922 It shall be unlawful for any person to sell or otherwise dispose of any firearm or ammunition to any person knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such person (fits into one of the 9 categories above). This applies to everyone&#8212;both dealers and private citizens&#8212;and it apples no matter where the gun is sold, given, or transferred. It applies on the floor of the gun show, in the bathroom at the gun show, in the parking lot of the gun show, in the basement of your home, or anywhere else. A violation of this provision is a felony punished by up to 10 years imprisonment.\n \n Simply put, there is no &#8220;gun show loophole&#8221; within the federal code. Additionally, there is nothing in the Code of Virginia which creates a gun show &#8220;loophole.&#8221; \n \n Here is the real issue we need to talk about. Notice that under federal (and Virginia) law, only FFL dealers are required to conduct background checks. As a private citizen with a gun I can sell it without being required to conduct a background check. I can advertise it for sale in my local newspaper, over the internet, or by word of mouth. I can sell it in my basement, out of the back of my car, or at someone&#8217;s place of work. I can also go to a gun show and try to sell it. I have never done this, but I know a gun show is a good place to privately sell firearms because they advertise and draw together a bunch of people who may be looking to buy a gun. Go to any gun show and you can see people offering their own guns for sale. They can make a sale on the floor of the arena without conducting a background check because they are not &#8220;dealers,&#8221; and it is all perfectly legal. However, as a private seller I still bear the responsibility for not selling to someone I either know or have reasonable cause to believe was prohibited from having the gun. \n \n What &#8220;gun show loophole&#8221; legislation seeks to do is&#8212;to put it simply&#8212;require a background check for any person, whether dealer or private citizen, who shows up and sells a gun at a gun show. Presumably the private buyer and seller would have to go to a FFL dealer at the show and get him to run the check for them (undoubtedly for a fee since the dealer would be required to create and maintain the record of the sale while not making any profit from the sale). It sounds good in theory, but there are a number of obvious problems with its enforcement. \n \n What happens when people meet at a car trunk in the parking lot to avoid paying the extra fee or the &#8220;hassle&#8221; of a background check? If you patrol the parking lot to prevent this, how do you stop a verbal agreement, or a wink and a nod, between the seller and the purchaser to meet later that afternoon at someone&#8217;s house to make the sale? For that matter, how does this law prevent such a sale in someone&#8217;s home year round? \n \n The proponents of the &#8220;gun show loophole&#8221; must know that by itself the proposed law will not stop the evil it seeks to prevent. The Brady Campaign loudly supports &#8220;gun show loophole&#8221; legislation, but notice how it will not acknowledge any of the obvious shortcomings in the legislation. Quite frankly, I believe organizations like the BC want the law to pass and then prove to be a failure. This is because, in my opinion, the failure of a &#8220;gun show loophole&#8221; law would provide the springboard to reach for a long cherished goal of that organization: Universal registration and background checks for everyone. \n \n Here is how it would happen. A &#8220;gun show loophole&#8221; law passes, and its only effect is to force a change in the location of the sales it seeks to prevent&#8212;that is&#8212;it drives these private sales out of the floor of the civic center and back out into streets and homes. This then provides the justification for the next claim: Closing the &#8220;gun show loophole&#8221; wasn&#8217;t enough. We now need to finish the job by regulating (what the BC has already called) the &#8220;kitchen table gun dealers.&#8221; We need a law to require everyone, everywhere, for every transaction (including gifts to family members), to first conduct a background check, and we need universal registration to track all firearms so we can enforce it.\n \n I believe you can never get at the perceived problem behind the non-existent &#8220;gun show loophole&#8221; without taking the extra step of mandatory firearm registration and mandatory background checks for every private sale, gift, or transfer of firearms. I do not favor such a law and I do not believe it could be enforced. The BC believes otherwise, but it recognizes there presently is simply no political will for this drastic step, and so the strategy must by design be one of incremental steps&#8212;starting with a partial gun show location based ban that is doomed to fail. \n \n Now as I said I do not favor this legislation. But I don&#8217;t mind debating and talking about it. I just wish we could do it in an intellectually honest fashion. So let me ask it this way:\n \n What does anyone else think will be the effect of the proposed &#8220;gun show loophole&#8221; law? If you feel that it would not be enough, then would you propose universal background checks for every private sale, gift, or transfer? If so, then do you believe universal registration of firearms is needed to ensure no hidden transfers occur? How would you enforce any of this?",

I haven't read or heard of any of that type legislation to close the \"gun show loop hole.\" Mainly its close the gun shows period. Personally I would love to be able to tap into the background check system if I was to sell a firearm. But as you mention it is never enough for the gun control freaks. It could be some thing as simple as having the gun show host (who ever is putting on the event) having a dealer to use his or her license to tap into the background check system. The fee to paid for by the host. Most shows charge an admittance fee any way. this should cover any fees for the checks. \n \n I am totally against any registration as the only reason for it is to know where they are when its time to go get them. No crimes are solved by registration and certainly none are prevented. ",
