At least that's the take on today's news that home mortgage foreclosures in May rose a sharp 90 percent as more of the low-down/no-down adjustable rate mortgages raised rates to the point of homeowners becoming unable to pay as Allen Greenspan and his predecessor Ben Bernanke both said would happen.\n \n According to RealtyTrac, a site that monitors the home-loan market, there were 176,137 notices of default, scheduled auctions and bank repossessions last month with California leading the pack, followed closely by Florida and Ohio.\n \n Last week, Freddie Mac (NYSE: FRE) reported that the rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loan rose to 6.53 percent, compared to 6.42 percent the prior week. The fixed-rate 30-year mortgage has not been this high since August, 2006, Freddie Mac reports.\n \n Five-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) averaged 6.24 percent this week, with an average 0.6 point, up from last week when it averaged 6.19 percent. A year ago, the 5-year ARM averaged 6.20 percent. The 5-year ARM has not been higher since the week ending August 3, 2006, when it averaged 6.27 percent.\n \n Fueling these higher mortgage rates are U.S. Treasury bonds, with the 10-year bond now trading at highs they haven't seen in five years. That's pushed mortgage lenders to raise rates, which in turn have forced many homeowners to the brink of foreclosure, as indicated by the sharp rise in the number of mortgage defaults last month.\n\n \n Screwed is putting it likely. Foreclosure numbers are FAR worse than even the most pessimistic projections. Even if we count last month as an outlier, the increase in foreclosures has still been over 20% higher (for this time period) than any projection I ever saw even just 3 months ago. \n \n I read several articles on the jump, and one thing that I found interesting is that several states that have seen significant increases in foreclosures were not \"bubble states\". In examining recent home price drops you see the same thing...prices falling in state where supposedly no real estate bubble existed.\n \n There are, I think, two theories about why this is. One is essentially \"herd mentality\". People read in the paper about RE bubbles popping and prices decreasing and it leads to price decreases in areas that were never included in the bubble to begin with. I have seen several well argued cases made to support this, but those who advocate the herd mentality theory seem to believe (for whatever reason) that while a herd mentality on the way down is axiomatic, no herd mentality existed as the market rose.\n \n The other theory that seems prevelant is based more on macroeconomic theory. Essentially the argument is that home prices should not have been rising at all the last several years and basically that they only have been because deficit spending and economic activity from the housing boom has fueled false growth. Typically home prices do not increase during a recession and have been known to decline during such times. Essentially what the advocates of this argument claim is that in order to accurately predict future housing market movements, you need to subtract bubble related and deficit spending for the last half decade since that is not real growth.\n \n Ultimatly I think that reality lies somewhere between the 2 arguments. The one thing that seems to be a certainty is that the declie of the housing market is far from over. On the contrary, it has just started. What we have seen up to this point is just the slowdown leading up to the decline.",

Wall street, though, has massive exposure. It was the generation of new credit derivatives that financed the bubble. Brokers originated the loans for countries like countrywide who then made the loans and then packaged them as bonds and sold them. The real villian in that ponzi scheme is wall street and federal regualtors who allowed the bond issuers to mix standard mortgage paper and sub prime mortgage paper and still market them as AAA bonds.\n \n When the fed crashed interest rates, they were not trying to create a RE bubble and I don't think anybody predicted that is what would happen. What the fed was trying to do was spur carry trade. At the time they made that move, the EU and Great Britain had not yet crashed their rates and at the time they indicated that they would not. By crashing our rates while theirs remaind high, it was possible for institutional investors to borrow USD at the low rate and pull an excellent return through euro zone investments. Essentially the end result would have been that we would have spread the misery of the dot com crash to them. \n \n Essentially, we were trying to be Japan where ultra low rates attract currency investors. Instead the EU and the British said \"screw you, we are not taking part of your hit\" and they crashed rates as well.\n \n So, we had rates at 1% and our scheme to spread our problems to others failed. At the time there was a lot of debate about where they liquidity would go. Conventional wisdom said there was no single market large enough to absorb the kind of cash influx needed. \n \n \nThe idea that \"real estate always goes up\" or \"IT is the future\" is a post-hoc explanation for remarkable rises, it attracts latecomers (suckers) but is insufficient in itself to sustain the boom, and we don't see these explanations emerge until the boom is already well underway.\n\n \n Wrong. I was hearing that on a large scale before the stock market had finished its downhill run. Individual investors were put off by their losses in the tech markets and were looking for a safer place for their money. The RE market had been performing for a couple of years and became a haven for risk adverse investors. \n \n It was not until nearly a year later that we started seeing credit derivatives being created to fund the buying spree. At one time mortgage denials were running in excess of 30% and there were whispers that even with interest rates as low as they were, we may face a liquidity crisis. Banks had no problem with financing homes within reason to prime borrowers with a reasonable down payment and an ability to repay. That was not good enough for the market. What the market demanded was speculative lending and wall street stepped up to provide it. The demand was there long before the supply and it was a herd mentality that generated the demand.",

   "When to buy?\n\n \n Certainly not this year and probably not next year.\n \n There are a lot of factors that will be coming into play in the RE market that will continue to drive it down. The sub prime problems have really just started. If you look at sub prime reset schedules what we have seen so far as far as resets go is actually just the tip of the iceberg. \n \n The sub prime problems have created an entirely different nightmare as well. New lending standards have been created that essentially remove 20% of potential buyers from the market. The increase in foreclosures (which will accelerate) ensure that we will see an increase in properties for sale, many at rock bottom foreclosure prices with a major simultaneous decrease in demand (since your demand base there is not just people who WANT a house but people who both WANT and can FINANCE that house).\n \n The ultimate result of that kind of increase in supply, especially with that supply being at bargain basement prices, coupled with that kind of decrease in demand will be lower prices. It is axiomatic. The 1.3% decrease that the NAR is predicting is absolutely laughable. Personally, I think that it is offensive to Americans that their new economics (whom, incidentally, they had to bring in because the old one had lost ALL credibility) believes that they are stupid enough to buy that.\n \n With peoples equity in their homes at record lows, any reasonable decrease in home values leads to some serious problems in the prime market. Banks, which seemed to understand from day one that there were some serious problems on the horizon, started including protectionist measures in their prime mortgages. These can be virtually anything, but none of them are good if you end up in a negative equity situation. A friend of mine who is a VP at a national bank told me (proudly) that their protectionist clause is one of the friendliest in the business. If you end up in a negative equity situation in your prime mortgage through that bank, your payment increases by a measly 70% until you are in an equity neutral position again, at which point your original payment is resumed. \n \n While reviewing a mortgage contract for a friend of my wife, I noted that their contract stipulated that in the event that they ended up in a negative equity situation they had 30 days to pay the difference or they faced immediate foreclosure. Similar measures seem to be present in about 70% of prime mortgages issued in the last 5 years. To middle class prime purchasers, this could be disasterous. How many middle class people do you know who could afford a 70% increase in their home payment, or could come up with 20-50K without the option of borrowing it, in 30 days?? Half...maybe??\n \n There are also wider economic issues that will keep the RE market down. We keep hearing about the RE slowdown \"not leaking into the wider economy\". While its effects have been limited, that does NOT mean that they are not coming. Look at Lowes and Home Depot. These are companies that are DIRECTLY tied to the RE market. The market started falling last year, but it was not until the first quarter of this year that they started reporting market related slowdown. So, it took a year for the effects to flow through to DIRECTLY RELATED industries. How long do you think it will take to see wider economic effects? I will save you some research....18-24 months is typical. \n \n So, basically, we are talking about RE related slowdowns spreading to the wider economy during a time when 20% of RE market demand has been destroyed, and supply has not only been increased, but the increase is in units priced for a fire sale. How long will this take to shake out?? Who knows?",

I was hearing that on a large scale (when) the RE market had been performing for a couple of years.\n\n \n Real estate has always been considered a \"safe investment\" that \"alwasy goes up\". I havebeen hearing that for 20 years. Usually it is followed by some idiot interjecting \"they don't make land anymore....\". While that statement is true, there is typically a limited supply of XXXXXX willing ot pay outrageously for it. The RE bubble is essentially a case where there were 2 supply side curves. \n \n \nSo again, the herd mentality never explains the origins of a boom. It always follows a boom, reinforces it, but once underlying conditions change the herd mentality can not sustain it.\n\n \n The herd mentality nearly always explains market bubbles. The first real bubble under modern economic systems was the tulip bubble. There were no underlying economic conditions, natural or induced, that led to that. It basically boiled down to a breakdown in rational market behavior. As LT points out, markets are typically efficient in the long term but often are not in the short term.\n \n Virtually every bubble I have studied has had its roots in an incredibly simplistic economic view that passes into \"convention wisdom\" and increases the available supply of stupid people. Some examples:\n \n The Ag bubble was spurred by XXXXXX wandering around saying \"people will always have to eat\". They used that and an expanding population argument to justify massive investments in agricultural production, which drove prices through the roof. Their simplistic analysis failed.\n \n The motto of the biotech bubble was \"people will pay anything to be healty\", Our current healthcare system proves that they were right about that, but they failed to take into account the fact that you actually needed to provide some product that will make them healthy. When the R&D from the biotech firms (especially the startups) failed to provide timely returns, the bubble burst.\n \n Really, with the housing bubble, there were 3 bits of CW that drove the market, all of which appealed to investors following the stock market failure.\n \n 1: Real estate always goes up. I remember seeing this on adds for real estate investment courses when I was in grade school. The idea that RE is a safe harbor investment is probably more firmly rooted in the American investors psyche than any other concept. This is why past RE failures have been so catastrophic.\n \n 2: A home has intrinsic value because you live in it. This is an argument based in emotion. While your home may carry some intrinisic value to YOU, to anybody else it is just a house.\n \n 3: The value of RE can not fall to zero. Barring some apocalyptic event resulting in the end of the world as we know it, this one is probably true. The problem is that it is a VAST oversimplification. While the value of the RE may not fall to zero, your equity can not only fall to zero, you can end up in a negative equity situaiton where zero looks pretty damn good. \n \n Considering the events of the time...millions of investors seeing their life savings reduced to zero as their beloved dot come stocks turned worthless, it is easy to see why people latched onto the age old myths of the RE market.",

   "http://www.axcessnews.com/index.php/articles/show/id/11275\n \n \n \n Screwed is putting it likely. Foreclosure numbers are FAR worse than even the most pessimistic projections. Even if we count last month as an outlier, the increase in foreclosures has still been over 20% higher (for this time period) than any projection I ever saw even just 3 months ago. \n \n I read several articles on the jump, and one thing that I found interesting is that several states that have seen significant increases in foreclosures were not \"bubble states\". In examining recent home price drops you see the same thing...prices falling in state where supposedly no real estate bubble existed.\n \n There are, I think, two theories about why this is. One is essentially \"herd mentality\". People read in the paper about RE bubbles popping and prices decreasing and it leads to price decreases in areas that were never included in the bubble to begin with. I have seen several well argued cases made to support this, but those who advocate the herd mentality theory seem to believe (for whatever reason) that while a herd mentality on the way down is axiomatic, no herd mentality existed as the market rose.\n \n The other theory that seems prevelant is based more on macroeconomic theory. Essentially the argument is that home prices should not have been rising at all the last several years and basically that they only have been because deficit spending and economic activity from the housing boom has fueled false growth. Typically home prices do not increase during a recession and have been known to decline during such times. Essentially what the advocates of this argument claim is that in order to accurately predict future housing market movements, you need to subtract bubble related and deficit spending for the last half decade since that is not real growth.\n \n Ultimatly I think that reality lies somewhere between the 2 arguments. The one thing that seems to be a certainty is that the declie of the housing market is far from over. On the contrary, it has just started. What we have seen up to this point is just the slowdown leading up to the decline.\n\n \n Should only get worse...should be good for us looking for property in 1-2yrs. The only sad part will be that I'll have to level the McMansion that sites on the lot where I want my home. No one wants a pre-designed home with 2,000 2ft small rooms in it.",

   "Incidentally (and I cannot believe that I didn't post this here), the washington post announced hte crash of the wider US economy last week. On June 13 they published an article by Steven Pearlstein about our credit bubble and the recent takeover boom that has been driving the stock market. \n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/12/AR2007061201801.html\n \n \nTo understand why there's a credit bubble, how it's inflating the price of stocks and what it will mean for you when it bursts, let's consider the acquisition of Avaya, a large telecommunications equipment maker, announced last week by two private-equity firms, Texas Pacific Group and Silver Lake Partners.\n\n \n \nCan the company handle that? Well, consider that only three years ago, Standard & Poor's calculated that operating profits for companies involved in leveraged buyouts were typically 3.4 times debt service. Last year, the number fell to 2.4. So far this year, it is 1.7.\n \n And the Avaya deal? It's 1.3 to 1, which, if you think about it, isn't much of a cushion if revenue suddenly falls or expenses rise more than expected. Nor would there be much cash left over for the company to increase its investment in research or pay for new plant and equipment.\n \n In other words, a deal like this would never get financed in normal times. Bank lenders and bondholders would demand that the new owners use more of their own money and take on less debt. Or they would demand interest rates so high that the company, as presently configured, wouldn't be able to generate enough cash to cover debt service. Either way, the buyers would never have agreed to pay $8.2 billion.\n \n But these are not normal times, and overpriced and over-leveraged deals like Avaya have been getting financed in record numbers. Back in 2004, about $275 billion in loans were issued for such highly leveraged transactions. By last year, that had risen to $490 billion. And in just the first five months of 2007, that record was broken.\n \n At some point sanity will be restored, triggered by any number of events. A high-profile acquisition could collapse because the new owners could not secure financing. Or a deal could blow up after it is discovered that there's really not enough cash to meet the debt payments. Or interest rates could suddenly rise from their current low level, threatening the viability of recently acquired companies and making it unlikely that the new owners will be able to sell for anything close to what they paid.\n \n In fact, over the past several weeks, all those things have begun to happen.\n\n \n \nOn the bond market, yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bill have increased from just under 4.5 percent to more than 5.25 percent -- a three-quarters-of-a-point jump without any action by the Federal Reserve.\n \n And just last week, William Gross, one of the country's leading bond investors, recanted on his prediction that interest rates were headed down, warning instead that yields on 10-year Treasurys could reach 6.5 percent over the next several years.\n \n Syndicated loans used to finance the recent purchases of the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Linens 'n Things and Freescale, a semiconductor maker, are trading at significant discounts only months after the deals were closed, after the companies reported disappointing earnings or cash flow.\n\n \n \n The washington post is WELL known for not publishing negative economic commentary until it is so obvious that it is unavoidable. This is so well known in the business world that it is a cliche (\"If you read about it in the post you are already screwed\"). \n \n An interesting and related article in businessweek just today:\n \n http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/jun2007/pi20070620_062980.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_top+story\n \n Stocks Swoon on Subprime Fears\n Worries that a broader bond shakeout could tighten credit sent equities reeling\n \n \nThe tight trading ranges and muted market activity of the past couple of sessions gave way to a full-scale sell-off on Wednesday. Stocks fell sharply as subprime mortgage fallout fears were fanned by the uncertain fate of two major hedge funds managed by Bear Stearns Cos. (BCS). \n\n \n \nAfter the market close, CNBC Business News reported that Merrill Lynch had seized $850 million in assets that were backing the two hedge funds and had begun to auction them off.\n\n \n This is related to the real estate bubble because the bubble has not burst yet, what we have seen thus far is just the slow down leading up to the puncture of the bubble. The bubble will nto have actually burst until a whole lot of people loose a whole lot of money. That \"equity\" implosion is what people refer to when they talk about a bubble bursting. \n \n So, we have millions of people who are set to loose their butts and don't even realize it. They have been investing in RE and RE related industries for the last several year and now are pulling their money out of those investments and looking to put it elsewhere. This is causing other parts of the markets to boom. That mini boom is starting to implode because the market cannot logically take that infusion of capital.",

The Federal Reserve pumped the funny money out into the market knowing this is where we would be.\n\n \n From what has been released so far, the bailout is non existant. What he is basically proposing is stuff that is already in the system and has been for 30 years.\n \n http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=aN.IOmnqhS04&refer=us\n \n \nBush will let the Federal Housing Administration, which insures mortgages for low- and middle-income borrowers, guarantee loans for delinquent borrowers, allowing them to avoid foreclosure and refinance at more favorable rates, according to an administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \n\n \n The only change here is actually the removal of a waiver requirement. Before you had to apply for the FHA mortgage insurance before you were 90 days behind. IF you were already 90 days past due, you could apply for a waiver based on extingent circumstances. Now you don't need the waiver, which means that everybody who is 90 days past due can get their mortgage insured. Yea....thats going to do a hell of a lot of good. By the time you are 90 days past due, foreclsure has begun. You cannot refi out of the mess.\n \n \nAmong the plans Bush will announce is a joint initiative of the Treasury and Housing and Urban Development departments to identify people who are at risk of defaulting on their mortgages, the official said. \n\n \n This is a step backward. Currently FHA identifies and works with people who are at risk of loosing thier homes. Don't know if you haev ever dealt with HUD, but you do NOT want hud involved unless they have to be.\n \n \nBush wants the government to work with lenders, insurers and others to develop more favorable loan products for those borrowers, the administration official said. \n\n \n Been doing this for 30 years. That is the entire point of the FHA.\n \n So, basically the Bush plan is to do nothing and change nothing. This is actually one of the few smart decisions Bush has made the entire time he has been in office. The market needs to correct, and we need to let it.\n \n There seems to be a perception that if we can just get people into fixed rate mortgages thigns will be OK. Not so. The spread betweem ARMS and fixed rate paper right now is razor thin. What is killing people is the fact that they bought houses based on what they could afford on the 2% teaser rates being offered. A jump to 6% on a fixed rate mortgage or a jump to 6.42% on an ARM is the same thing to them...a house payment they can't make.",

Not a fan at all. Markets that overshoot have to correct. If not, you end up with a total cluster####.\n \n The only thing that would help those people now is a cash bailout anyway. Nobody is going to finance them without mortgage insurance at that point, and mortgage insurance is not cheap.\n \n If you look at Bushs plan, he wants to expand the FHA mortgage insurance program to help those folks. He wants to make the rate for it variable (currently it is fixed at 1.5%) so it can float between 1.5 and 2.2% depending on the level of risk involved. FHA mortgage insurance also required a 3% cash surety (cash down).\n \n So, you have somebody with a $200,000 mortgage on an Alt-A arm (because I know those numbers off the top of my head). They have been paying at the teaser rate of 1.5% for the last 2 years and now it is going to reset. Assuming they have decent credit, their new rate is going to be right about 6.14%.\n \n Lets say they can't make the payments that come with that, and are behind, so they decide to take advantage of Bushs neat new program. They go down to the FHA, fill out the paperwork. First, they have to come up with $6000 which may or may not be a problem (though I think that $6000 in cash is likely to be a problem for somebody behind on their mortgage payments).\n \n So, they get their mortgage insurance and get a fixed rate mortgage. Since the loan is now insured, they can get a better rate. Currently they could probably get 5.8%. BUT, their mortgage insurance is costing them 1.5% on top of that, so they are at 7.3%. Not a real moneysaver there.\n \n The problems in the RE market are structural problems. There is not a whole lot that can be done to help. Mortgage rates are still relatively low. If people cannot afford their current rates, moving to another type of mortgage is probably not going to do them much good. It is time for a little tough love and a little economics 101. If you can't afford it, you CANT HAVE IT.\n \n In one of the stupidest comments I have ever heard from any politician, Bush said:\n \n \nI plan to help homeowners, the government's got a role to play,'' Bush said in a statement at the White House. ``But it's not the government's job to bail out speculators or those who made the decision to buy a home they couldn't afford.'' \n\n \n People who did not buy homes that can't afford DONT NEED A BAILOUT. They never will. The entire problem in the industry is that a WHOLE LOT of people bought homes they could not afford. If we limit it to people who did not buy homes that they could not afford, nobody will be getting bailed out, which is a good thing.\n \n Markets rise and fall. The longer you put off contraction, the worse it is going to be. It is like borrowing money to pay overhead. It is a policy that is destined for complete and utter failure. Fractional banking makes it even worse since that excess equity that should have been wiped out in market contractions is leveraged. \n \n I am actually very happy with what we have seen of Bushs plan thus far. Do nothign and let the market correct, but make a speach where you announce as new the programs that have been in place for 30 years to keep the voters complacent.\n \n I also find myself agreeing with Bernanke for the first time ever.\n \n http://www.investmentnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070831/REG/70831012\n \n \n\"It is not the responsibility of the Federal Reserve - nor would it be appropriate - to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions,\" remarked Fed chairman Ben Bernanke at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's Economic Symposium today in Jackson Hole, Wyo.\n\n \n Apparently he DID learn the lesson of the Greenspan fed, which was that if you continually bail out markets, it will eventually come back to bite you in the butt. I actually feel kind of sorry for him because the mess he is dealing with now...the mess that will define his legacy...was made by Greenspan and there are a lot of people out there who are not going to understand the situation well enough to assign credit where it is due on this one. \n \n I also feel kind of sorry for him because the FED seems to have lost control. They lowered the discount rate to inject liquidity and made changes to the way the discount window operates (like 30 day rollover loans) and even went to the trouble of arranging with 4 of the biggest banks in the country to each set an example by taking $500,000 from the discount window. Last weeks discount window action....1.1 billion. they expected 40 times that. Nobody is willing to lend...they are afraid of what will happen...and nobody is willing to borrow right now because the crappy economic fundamentals that we have been dodging for so long seem to be looming pretty big and may be unavoidable this time around.",

Only thing I can think is that people took the same policy of spending as the country did which reminds me of what the GAO has said every year for at least the past 3 years (and I'm sure further back) which is you can't sustain a level of spending that you can't remotely afford.

I actually feel kind of sorry for him because the mess he is dealing with now...the mess that will define his legacy...was made by Greenspan and there are a lot of people out there who are not going to understand the situation well enough to assign credit where it is due on this one. \n \n I also feel kind of sorry for him because the FED seems to have lost control. They lowered the discount rate to inject liquidity and made changes to the way the discount window operates (like 30 day rollover loans) and even went to the trouble of arranging with 4 of the biggest banks in the country to each set an example by taking $500,000 from the discount window. Last weeks discount window action....1.1 billion. they expected 40 times that. Nobody is willing to lend...they are afraid of what will happen...and nobody is willing to borrow right now because the crappy economic fundamentals that we have been dodging for so long seem to be looming pretty big and may be unavoidable this time around.\nAnd yet it seems this was as predictable as the sun rising. I remember my dad telling me when he went into a bank they were telling him the housing market was going to be going up and up forever. Who in their right mind would think that? Has no one taken a basic history class?",

   "I agree 100% and it really didn't take a Mensa meeting to see where the housing market was going. Only thing I can think is that people took the same policy of spending as the country did which reminds me of what the GAO has said every year for at least the past 3 years (and I'm sure further back) which is you can't sustain a level of spending that you can't remotely afford. Seems people should have taken the same advice. \n \n Now you got banks in a panic and even those banks that didn't do a lot of home mortgages are in a panic. I'm not positive but Gateway bank here in Virginia has had their stock tank even when they have really done mostly business financing. \n\n \n I think that in the end,traditional banks will do fine (in fact I have picked up some stock in several banks lately) because there is a lot of collateral damage out there...as you say...banks with zero exposure taking major hits. \n \n IMO we are rapidly reaching the point where this is coming to a head. Your parrallel between out of control government spending and out of control personal spending is, IMO, entirely valid. Consumers, without the ability to print money, are going to suffer from the problems created by living on debt first, and then the government will suffer. \n \n \nI believe I said earlier that I am not fretting over this since I was smart to rent for awhile until things settled down (although I can easily afford a house...seems better to wait for some POS house on nice land to be auctioned off by the bank). I don't advocate renting very often though.\n\n \n Smart man. As far as POS houses...any McMansion nuilt in the last 5-8 years should work :) \n \n \n \nHa, it seems like you almost have to do this if you want to be a good president....tell the people something and do something that works and is right while disguising it for what people want to hear. Probably a sad and true reality.\n\n \n In this case I think he did well. It boosted consumer confidence, which will allow for an orderly correction (still a terrible, painful nasty correction that will leave millions wihtout their homes...but orderly). The only thing the government could actually do would be cash grants, which means printing debt backed money, and that is not a real hot idea right now.\n \n \nAnd yet it seems this was as predictable as the sun rising. I remember my dad telling me when he went into a bank they were telling him the housing market was going to be going up and up forever. Who in their right mind would think that? Has no one taken a basic history class?\n\n \n There are 2 phrases that people should always listen for:\n \n 1. \"It will always go up\"\n 2. \"It is a whole new market...the old rules don't apply anymore\"\n \n Any time you hear either of those, it is time to start thinking about getting out.",
