   "The following statement from the APA was provided to The Advocate in response to a request related to the story \"Brainwashed No More\" in the August 30, 2005, issue:  \n \n The term \"reparative therapy\" refers to psychotherapy aimed at eliminating homosexual desires and is used by people who do not think homosexuality is one variation within human sexual orientation, but rather still believe homosexuality is a mental disorder. \n \n The most important fact about \"reparative therapy,\" also sometimes known as \"conversion\" therapy, is that it is based on an understanding of homosexuality that has been rejected by all the major health and mental health professions. \n \n The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Counseling Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the National Association of School Psychologists, and the National Association of Social Workers, together representing more than 477,000 health and mental health professionals, have all taken the position that homosexuality is not a mental disorder, and thus there is no need for a \"cure.\" \n \n The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association and defining the standard of the field, does not include homosexuality as a mental disorder. All other major health professional organizations have supported the American Psychiatric Association in its declassification of homosexuality in 1973 as a mental disorder. Thus, the idea that homosexuality is a mental disorder, or that the emergence of same-gender sexual desires among some adolescents is in any way abnormal or mentally unhealthy, has no support among health and mental health professional organizations. \n \n Despite the unanimity of the health and mental health professions on the normality of homosexuality, the idea of \"reparative therapy\" has recently been adopted by conservative organizations and aggressively promoted in the media. Because of this aggressive promotion of \"reparative therapy,\" a number of the health and mental health professional organizations have recently issued public statements about \"reparative therapy\" as well. \n \n The American Psychological Association, in its Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation, which is also endorsed by the National Association of School Psychologists, states: \"The American Psychological Association opposes portrayals of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth and adults as mentally ill due to their sexual orientation and supports the dissemination of accurate information about sexual orientation, and mental health, and appropriate interventions in order to counteract bias that is based in ignorance or unfounded beliefs about sexual orientation.\" \n \n As these statements make clear, health and mental health professional organizations do not support efforts to change young people's sexual orientation through \"reparative therapy\" and have raised serious concerns about its potential to do harm. Many professional associations are able to provide helpful information and local contacts to assist school administrators, health and mental health professionals, educators, teachers, and parents in dealing with school controversies in their communities. \n \n \"Transformational ministry\" is a term used to describe the use of religion to eliminate homosexual desires. While \"reparative therapy\" relies on secular approaches, \"transformational ministry\" takes the approach that \"freedom from homosexuality is possible through repentance and faith in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord.\" While there is some diversity within the movement, most \"transformational ministries\" adhere to a belief that \"upholds heterosexuality as God's creative intent for humanity, and subsequently views homosexual expression as outside God's will.\" \n \n The \"transformational ministry\" movement, which began in the early 1970s, has gained more visibility in the media recently through the efforts of Christian publishers and conservative political organizations. \n \n The most important fact about \"transformational ministry\" is that its view of homosexuality is not representative of the views of all people of faith. Many deeply religious people, and a number of religious congregations and denominations, are supportive and accepting of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people and their right to be protected from the discriminatory acts of others. For example, the following [religious] organizations have endorsed passage of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation: \n American Ethical UnionAmerican Friends Service CommitteeAmerican Jewish CommitteeAmerican Jewish CongressChurch of the BrethrenChurch Women UnitedDignity/USAEpiscopal ChurchEvangelical Lutheran Church in AmericaHadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of AmericaThe Interfaith AllianceJewish Women InternationalNational Council of the Churches of Christ USANational Council of Jewish WomenNorth Georgia United Methodist ConferencePresbyterian Church (USA)Religious Action Center of Reform JudaismUnitarian Universalist AssociationUnited Church of ChristUnited Methodist ChurchWomen of Reform JudaismYoung Women's Christian Association\n Although \"transformational ministry\" promotes the message that religious faith and acceptance of gay, lesbian, and bisexual sexuality are incompatible, that message is countered by the large number of outspoken clergy and people of faith who promote love and acceptance.\n http://www.advocate.com/exclusive_detail_ektid19739.asp",

After all, you're essentially talking about taking peoples' freedoms away at that point.\n\n \n This isn't actually true; the government has the power to ban anything it wants without any reason for banning it (see same-sex marriage, or interracial marriage if you prefer).\n \n However, I agree that it would be morally wrong to ban reparative therapy; I think an individual should be free to try to change his sexual orientation if he wants to, just as someone should be free to try to change his hair color if he wants. I've even thought about going to a reparative therapy place, just out of curiosity over whether their techniques are effective, but I do not know of any reparative therapy place that accepts people who don't particularly want to change and who aren't particularly religious.\n \n If reparative therapy is harmful, it may be a good idea to prevent parents from sending their children to get reparative therapy, or only allowing it if the child also wants to go. But even then I'm not so certain... That is still an attack on the freedom of parents to raise their children as they see fit.\n \n So I mostly agree with Jyoshu.

   "While its supporters cite success stories from their clinical practices as well as a recent and much debated study showing that conversion therapy can work, the treatment is opposed by virtually every medical and mental health organization, including the American Medical Association, the U.S. Surgeon General and the American Psychiatric Association (APA), which removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973.\n \n Until the early 1990s the treatment, also known as reorientation therapy, was largely relegated to religious groups or to the fringes of mental health. Mainstream therapists have been taught to help patients distressed about their homosexuality work toward self-acceptance, to overcome the internalized homophobia thought to be the cause of much emotional turmoil.\n \n Reparative therapists reject the views held by an overwhelming majority of mental health practitioners. They regard homosexuality as a pathological preference forged in the crucible of a troubled childhood and not, as most scientists believe, an inborn orientation significantly influenced by biological factors such as genetics and exposure to hormones in the womb.\n \n \"I don't think sexual orientation is genetically determined, but like a lot of preferences we have in life is a complicated and idiosyncratic mix of temperament and experience,\" said Warren Throckmorton, a supporter of reparative therapy who is an associate professor of psychology at Grove City College in Pennsylvania and former president of the American Mental Health Counselors Association. \"The other reason I think change is possible is that I've worked with a lot of clients who've done it.\"\n \n In the past decade, the growing influence of religious conservatives and the national debate over gay rights, especially gay marriage, has revived interest in the therapy, significantly raising its public profile, spawning new practitioners and igniting debate about a matter that had been considered settled, supporters and critics agree.\n \n \"Reparative therapy is the laetrile of mental health,\" said New York psychiatrist Jack Drescher, referring to the quack cancer cure banned in the United States in the 1970s.\n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/15/AR2005081501022.html",

   "Lets really take a look at the therapy itself, not the groups invovled......here is a list of one type of tatic or method used to \"treat\" homosexuals....This method is being used by both the \"Reparative\" groups and the \"Ministry\" groups. I think the ministry groups would fall under the \"SHAME AVERSION\" therapy method....consider barbaric if you ask me....\n \n read on....there are also some other methods listed on the link below.....equally as disturbing and still in use by groups like NARTH, EXODUS and Courage to Change.......just to name a few....\n \n Aversion therapy \n This method was first used in 1935 in an effort to eliminate homosexuality. It attempts to associate in the patient's mind a previously attractive sexual stimulus or behavior with an unpleasant sensation, such as pain, nausea, or fear. The therapist presents the patient with a deviant stimulus (such as a photograph of a nude child, or an audiotape of a child in a sexual context), while simultaneously presenting him with an unpleasant (aversive) stimulus.27 \n \n Aversive stimuli have included the following:28 \n \n vomit-inducing and paralysis-inducing substances - discontinued due to risk of gastric rupture, salt depletion, cardiovascular problems, fever, and delerium \n electric shock - commonly used in the past, now considered unethical by many \n substances producing noxious odors, such as ammonia - commonly used today29 (One treatment specialist has recommended the use of putrifying tissue, such as human placenta inoculated with bacteria, perhaps \"doped\" with meat, fish, urine, or feces.30) \n Covert sensitization is a physically safer variation that has also been used with homosexuals and sexual deviants.31 \n \n \n Both the deviant stimulus and the aversive stimulus are to be imagined and described aloud by the patient, rather than actually experienced. \n The described aversive situation is required to be an extremely noxious or nauseating scene, feelings of intense shame and guilt, or severe legal consequences. \n The method is sometimes supplemented with actual aversive stimuli such as noxious odors. \n Another variation, shame aversion therapy, involves subjecting the patient to public shame or humiliation in conjunction with his deviant behavior.32 \n \n Evaluations of the effectiveness of these methods have been uncontrolled case studies, involving very small numbers of subjects, and have found inconsistent results.33 \n \n Some studies have found that homosexual and deviant arousal patterns decreased, but then returned to original levels when treatment was stopped. \n Researchers say aversion therapy seems not to interfere with normal sexual functioning. \n No studies of side-effects have been conducted. \n Some doctors have claimed that in the case of homosexual men, aversion therapy has resulted in serious long-term psychological effects, including feelings of despair and depression.34 \n Only a few cases of shame therapy are reported in the literature; one reported that a transvestite attempted suicide after a treatment session.35 \n http://www.mhamic.org/treatment/treatment_print.htm",

   "Beverly A. Grubb said she went to a Brentwood therapist to be cured of homosexuality but instead ended up in an intimate relationship with the therapist.\n \n Grubb, 59, is now suing her former therapist-turned-domestic-partner and TrueHope for the Best Alternative, the Brentwood counseling center she went to for treatment.\n \n Grubb alleges that Phyllis Garrison, a licensed clinical social worker at TrueHope, manipulated her into an intimate domestic living arrangement that ended three months ago. Grubb had gone to TrueHope hoping to be reoriented to heterosexuality in 1997.\n \n The lawsuit was filed last month in Williamson County Circuit Court. Grubb is seeking unspecified damages for breach of confidentiality, emotional distress, lost wages and humiliation.\n \n The case raises a question that continues to be debated nationwide: Is homosexuality a condition that can be cured? It also calls into question therapist-client ethics.\n \n A poll conducted in 2003 by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life showed that Americans are evenly split on opinions about whether they think gay people could change. The survey of 1,515 adults indicated that 42% said homosexuals could change their orientation, 42% said they couldn't and 16% had no opinion.\n \n \"I went to TrueHope for the cure and, while they didn't cure me, I believe you can be cured,\" Grubb said in a telephone interview yesterday. \"I'm a devout Christian. This isn't real easy for me.\"\n \n Grubb, who has two adult children and was once married, said she recently overcame her attraction to the same sex by going to church, studying the Bible and praying. \"I was able to help myself,\" she said. \"I think TrueHope hurt me tremendously.\"\n \n Garrison declined to comment about the case or her thoughts on homosexuality.\n \n TrueHope's attorney, James D. Kay Jr., said his client believes Grubbs' claims are \"outrageous\" and said the counseling center will defend itself. Kay said TrueHope, a nonprofit organization funded by local churches and private donors, is a faith-based ministry that counsels people with sexual issues.\n \n The lawsuit charges that Garrison abused her authority as a therapist by preying on Grubb's desire to cease being homosexual. Grubb claims that she and Garrison purchased a home together and discussed confidential information about other TrueHope clients.\n \n \"Shortly after I went to them, Phyllis Garrison became my friend and said she couldn't be my friend and therapist both,\" Grubb said. \"We became friends, and I moved in with her. You never imagine you will be friends with your therapist. I went to her for professional help.\"\n \n TrueHope is one of two places listed on Exodus International's Web site as offering counseling to homosexuals in Middle Tennessee. Exodus International is a nonprofit, interdenominational Christian organization devoted to freeing people from homosexuality \"through the power of Jesus.\"\n \n Chris Sanders, director of development and alumni relations at the Vanderbilt Divinity School, said the notion that there is a cure for homosexuality creates confusion among the public.\n \n \"What's at stake there is if they can make a case that it can be cured, then they can make the case that it should be. And if it should be, then why grant (homosexuals) equal rights?\" Sanders asked. \"There's a real political element to this.\"\n \n Sanders said there is no place for reparative therapy in mainstream psychology.\n \n Richard Holloman, executive director of the Nashville-based Sight Ministry, the other program listed on the Exodus Web site, said his organization doesn't believe homosexuality is a disease treatable with medication, but an addiction that can be controlled.\n \n \"It requires a long-term process of dealing with issues from one's early childhood issues or the developmental years,\" Holloman said. \"It's a process that involves dealing with past hurts, wounds and trauma and seeking a deeper walk spiritually with God. It's not something that happens overnight or even in a year or two. The process is different for a lot of people.\"\n \n Holloman said Sight Ministry believes in reparative therapy to heal emotional wounds that may have driven a person to same-sex attraction.\n\n http://www.gallatinnewsexaminer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050901/NEWS01/509010434/1006/MTCN04",

   "Anne Heche has a message for her mother: \"Stop calling me an ex-gay.\" \n \n She is lashing out at her mother for being part of Focus on the Family's 'ex-gay' speaking tour. Nancy Heche frequently tells audiences that the power of prayer made her daughter dump Ellen DeGeneres and go straight. \n \n \"Ellen and I had a three and a half year relationship that ended sadly, not because we were both women, but because we both wanted different things for our lives,\" Heche says in a posting on her official website. \n \n \"This Nonsense about my mother praying for me is really making me angry. My mother never approved of my relationship with Ellen. Her hatred for our relationship is one of the many things that ultimately led to my breaking off all communication with her. (My mother, that is, not Ellen.)\" \n \n The actress also attacks the so-called 'ex-gay' movement. \n \n \"The \"Ex-gay\" events that are going on right now make me sick,\" she writes on her site. \n \n \"The fact that my mother is using my name to promote this movement makes me even sicker. I could not disagree more adamantly with what she and her group of unloving, unaccepting, Bible preaching hate mongers are doing. I do not believe that homosexuality is something that should be brainwashed out of someone. I do not believe that homosexuality should be anything but celebrated if that is the thing that makes an individual feel good about their life. I believe, as I have always said, that people should love who they want to love.\" \n \n After her breakup with DeGeneres Heche married a man, but she repeats on her site that the split had nothing to do with lesbianism. \n \n \"And for anyone who ever thought that Ellen and I broke it off because of sexuality, you couldn't be more mistaken. And for anyone who thought my mother's prayers had anything to do with me marrying a man, forget it. I can safely say that my mother has nothing to do with any decision I make. It has always disturbed me the way religion can twist something to make people feel badly about themselves. Isn't a loving heart an accepting, caring heart? Certainly my mother has never been \"loving.\" But that's just my humble opinion.\" \n \n FOC's 'Love Won Out' conferences have been held across the country. Nancy Heche is regularly a featured speaker. The organization's website says Heche is \"a single parent who experienced the international media rush during her daughter Anne Heche's highly visible relationship with Ellen DeGeneres, and a widow who endured her husband's diagnosis of and subsequent death from AIDS.\" \n \n Nancy Heche frequently tells audiences that homosexuality can be cured with prayer and points to Anne as an example of this.\n http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/09/092105heche.htm",
