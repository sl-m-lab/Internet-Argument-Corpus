   "The fact is that the tendency of Turkey seizure into the ring of unstable countries (Iraq, Georgia, Iran and Syria) is becoming noticeable. The situation with Iran, Iraq and Syria is clear, Americans are trying to get new oilfields under the mask of totalitarian regimes annihilation and controlling over nuclear nonproliferation.\n But the question with Georgia has been open. Americans hoped to get territories for their military bases deployment to carry the war against Iran when they organized velvet revolution in Georgia. And now in spite of all troubles which Saakashvili is bringing to US, Americans don't want to do anything for situation stabilization in the Caucasus. Such instability must be advantageous for the US. 'Democratic' regime of inadequate Saakashvili is needed by the USA for they are going to use it against Turkey which became intractable too much last time. Well, first of all Americans want to get control over oil pipeline Baku-Tbilisi-Djeihan; this is best lever of pressure. Because of with civil war in Georgia beginning Americans with protract the launch of the oilpipe as long as they like blackmailing Turks by it. The traffic of Asian goods through Iran to Turkey will be stopped with start of war against Iran and most part of freight will get to Turkey via Georgia controlled by Americans J. And one more reason is the American wish to create an independent Kurdish on part of territory belonging to Iraq, Iran, Syria, Armenia and Turkey, which will be under full US control. Look, Turkey will have to take appropriate steps for destabilization spilling over the borders the restless neighbor. Moreover Turkey will nave to search for compromise in the questions of home and foreign policy under the pressure of the US.",
