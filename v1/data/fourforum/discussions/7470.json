They will point out that the pharyngeal pouches never break through to become true \"gill slits\" in human embryos. They will also give you a lecture about Haeckel's \"faked drawings\", and explain that all of the evolutionary stages are NOT recapitulated in ontogeny as Haeckel's Law states. They will do this in order to give the impression that there is absolutely no evidence for evolution in embryology.\n \n But there is plenty of evidence, and this fact can be pointed out by explaining how modified versions of embryonic stages are recapitulated, rather than an idealized, unmodified recapitulation of the adult ancestors. There is still a lot that can be explained, however, such as the exaptation of the first pharyngeal arch for the jaw, or the reduction of the 6 Aortic arches to be fashioned into three pair of arteries (Aorta / Pulmonary / Carotid), or the long course of the Recurrent Laryngeal nerve. I have yet to see a creationist refute the evolutionary implications of these developments.",

   "I hope everyone knows that human embryos have gills for a time.\nNo they don't. Where did you ever hear that? All mammalian embryos, humans included, have pharyngeal pouches for a time. They are separated by aortic arches. These structures develop into the gill arches in fish, but in other organisms they never do. They have been called \"gill slits\" because of their similiarity to the structures in fish embryos that develop into gills. But they never, ever form gills in mammals.\n \nIs that an intelligent design?\nI think that the question is moot.\n \nOntogeny Recapitulates Phylogeny!!\nAh!

You are also astute to point out the undergrad embryo class as the I heard the phrase. Again, the edification is appreciated.",
