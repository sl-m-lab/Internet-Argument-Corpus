   "Christ!That chip on your shoulder must really be heavy.\n Lets hate success say the losersemoticon_idea\n\n \n Success? Based on bending the rules, subterfuge, cheating, embezzling, character assassination, and greed?\n Please!\n \n Conservatism: The Politics Of Ignorance and Self-Interest\n The reason that the conservative doesn't nurture those values and instititutions of freedom for all, is that the concept of freedom to a conservative is a deeply personal one. It generally stems from personal experience or from personal history in which the conservative or someone close to him has had a negative experience with government or the intervention, perceived or real, of government in his life. Therefore, the language used by conservatives in relation to freedom is personal. It is replete with personal examples, such as personal forms of taxation, stories of government regulations or bureaucrats gone bad. In relation to the rest of society, it is always vague generalizations, such as \"getting government off the backs of the people.\" The disparity in the language reflects the personal nature of conservatism.\n \n I like to say that conservatism is the politics of the middle and upper class, adult, white, Anglo-Saxon, male, heterosexual, Protestant Republicans. Of course, the ranks of conservatives include many people who don't fit all of those labels, but a look at the delegates who attended the 1996 Republican National Convention in San Diego was quite revealing. Fully 94 percent of the delegates were white, more than three-quarters male, and only four out of the thousands attending were openly homosexual. Most were from upper-class backgrounds or from the management of corporations. The presence of large numbers of religious fundamentalists was made clear by the frequent appearances in the media by Ralph Reed, the director of the Christian Coalition, who spent over $1 million coordinating his troops there. The people who were present at that convention said more about the agenda than the rhetoric from the platform did.\n \n The other large group of conservatives are middle class (mostly) men of limited education who feel alienated and victimized by liberal policies which they feel have not been to their benefit. These men often come from poor and working class backgrounds and fail to realize that their upward mobility was often made possible by the very liberal policies, such as the fostering of the labor movement, they now angrily denounce.\n \n Why is it that conservatives come from these two very different groups? Well, just consider for a moment: getting \"government off the backs of the people\" benefits the upper-class who run corporations which can increase their personal wealth and the companies can externalize their costs by shifting them to the taxpayer through the avoidance of taxes and \"burdensome\" regulations, such as pollution laws, securities regulations, etc. The middle-class males benefit by discouraging Affirmative Action and similar liberal policies they view, wrongly as it turns out, as a threat to their economic status. Adults of limited parenting skills benefit by the conservative obstruction of government efforts to protect children from child abuse and neglect. Whites like conservative policies because it means they don't have to support and protect racial minorities or suffer from economic competition from them. Males tend to like conservative policies because they would allow the continuation of the presumed right of males to discriminate against women simply because they think they have a natural right to. Heterosexuals who don't like the idea of gay men and lesbians having the same right to marry are drawn to conservative politics because they presume the conservative emphasis on \"traditional values\" give them the right to deny marriage and other civil rights to homosexuals. Conservatives tend to be Republican because that party has adopted conservative ideology since its earliest days, while the Democratic party, since the founding of the American republic, has always been far more liberal.\n \n Conservatism has a commonality of philosophy amongst its members simply because there is a commonality of experience that has brought these people to their political views. You're far more likely to find yourself agreeing with someone whose life has paralleled your own, because he is much more likely to have arrived at the same conclusions you have. This is why the gatherings of conservatives produce crowds that all tend to look alike.\n \n This leads to an obvious question: If conservative economics is so harmful to the economic interests of the lower and middle classes, why are so many of them conservative?\n \n The answer to that can be only described as a combination of deception and shallow thinking. The deception is on the part of the rich and powerful who see a keen self interest in convincing the lower and middle classes that a simplistic, \"free enterprise\" model of economics is in their interests. The shallow thinking is on the part of the lower and middle classes who simply accept it without question, because it comes from those who've \"made it\" and who \"obviously\" know more than they do, and have limited educational experience with which to understand the rhetoric.\n \n A classic example is Ronald Reagan's so-called \"trickle down\" theory. In it, he claimed that if the rich were allowed to keep more of what the poor and middle class were producing, more of it would then \"trickle down\" to those below, and they would end up richer. No one ever thought to ask whether giving someone else more of the wealth you produce really would actually make you richer. Of course it doesn't, but that didn't stop the conservatives from accepting the notion no matter how silly it was. They simply accepted it because it was handed down by their opinion leaders, who had a vested interest in their accepting it.",

Well who thought to ask this:\n \n \"Who is asking you to give money to rich people? A moral person claims that your money is yours and that you may give it to who ever you wish.\"",
