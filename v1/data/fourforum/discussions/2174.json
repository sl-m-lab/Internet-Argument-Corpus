   "Dear Pro-lifer's, Pro-choicer's\n Why not stop the back and forth arguing and galvanize your efforts toward stopping unwanted pregnancies in the first place? This is a point that is missed and I really do not understand how. If both sides of the issue would make a concerted effort to educate young men and women on the crucial importance of birth control and/or abstinence, the whole abortion issue could be rendered practically moot.  It is such a waste of energy as both sides are polarized by complete stubborness. I admonish both sides:\n \n Pro-Choice people: Try to understand that a pro-life person dosen't (neccessarily) want to control you, many simply believe in the sanctity of human life at conception. You believe in sanctity of life, but they believe it starts earlier than you do. You must admit that you do not have the answer to the issue of when a fetus converts from just a fetus with human properties to a full fledged human. This is why women that do not want to get pregnant MUST insist on taking the full responsibility of contraception with utmost respect and seriousness. The friends of mine that had abortions were not systematic with their routine as they should have been. More often than not (but not always) it is a big case of \"OOPS.\" The risk of pregnancy demands staunch discipline.\n \n \n Pro-life people, \n I understand your view on the premis of the fetus being a human life. But you have a bigger problem to address than just the suffering of fetuses. Do you not understand that millions upon millions of children around the world at this very moment in time do not have enough to eat, suffer from disease and are left orphans? An abortion ends the human existence in the womb in a moment, a starving childs suffering can go on for years. (A crisis in Africa right now-- some 1 million orphaned children.) If you happen be a Pro-lifer who is Christian, Jesus said nothing on abortion to my knowledge (ironically he did say woe to pregnant women who are nursing during the end times, LUKE 21:23), however, he was very clear on feeding the hungry and poor MAT 25:35-46: \"I was hungry and you did not take me in...Inasmuch as you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.\" Ask yourself, \"What have I done today to follow Jesus' teaching on feeding the hungry?\" Please do all you can do to alleviate the pain and suffering of children that are in the world before you expend your energies to champion the cause of unborn children in the womb. \n \n So thats all. Please remember, Pro-life, pro-choice, we are all dumb humans trying to figure this thing called life. Bury the hatchet and work together to eliminate unwanted pregnancy's, (therefore reducing any need for abortion)and work together to give food, shelter and love to all in need everywhere.",
