   "Hillary Clinton has made records of her stint in the White House off limits until after the 2008 election. The keeper of the Clinton White House Archives has locked the public out of any documents that deal with Hillary (until after the 2008 election). There must be some skeletons in her many closets.\n \n It appears we'll just have to remember things like the Rose Law Firm dishonesty and the finding in her living quarters of some long missing documents...and we'll just have to wonder what she's hiding...not to mention her list of questions that are \"off limits\" at to journalists. She doesn't want to be pressured by things she can't explain in a vote-getting manner.\n \n Makes you wonder....just why does this woman fear being exposed for what she is.\n \n Perhaps it's that she realizes that she is indeed a sorry, dishonest POS...just like her \"husband\", Slick Willy.\n \n \n http://www.dailyindia.com/show/165629.php/Hillary-archives-locked-till-post-election",

It's expected that past behavior should be thoroughly scrutinized. \"I don't want to go there\" is NOT a good excuse.\n \n The more that comes out about Obama, the less I like him. Hillary likely understands that more things coming out about her past (in other words...THE TRUTH OF THER MATTER) will likely have the same effect on some of the people she's already got folled into thinking she's worthy of the office.\n \n Unfortunately, I think we can count on seeing a Hillary/Obama ticket from the dems.

With as many dupes and vote-for-a-living people we have here, they'll be hard to beat.\n\n \n Personally, my prediction is that in the end neither Hillary NOR Obama will get the nomination.
