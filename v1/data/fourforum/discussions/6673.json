Gold or diamonds?\n\n \n I don't know either, but I think we are going to find out. Consumer prices are up 4.7% over the last year, 1.2% in the last month alone. The fed has been making increasingly distressing statements regarding inflation (any thinking person saw inflation as a foregone conclusion months ago) which almost certainly forehadows increased interest rates, and likely means that the 4.5% previously estimated by many is not anywher near the top end from the feds perspective.\n \n I think that there is a serious problem in the fact that the old raise interest rates to stave off inflation formula does not seem to be working well anymore due to the flat demand for expansion capital. If it was still working, the increases we have already seen in interest rates would almost certianly have had effect. As is, they havv not and we have seen inflation steadily increaing over the last year. At 4.5%, the housimg market will be in serious trouble. Anything above that, and it signals the end of the housing bubble regardless of where consumer confidence sits, there is simply not enoggh money floating around to keep it up. \n \n Probably won't be an issue, since the way consumer confidence numbers have been droppoign the end of the housing bubble will almost certainly burst regardless of interest rates.\n \n Gold or diamonds? I would say gold and small caliber ammunition.

As such, I prefer to put it in my safe as opposed to buying it on paper (archaic, I know). Uranium has storage problems, like you need a really heavy safe and I am sure there is a permit process. I generally just play the currency market to protect against inflation. I have been told that there is a lot fo danger in that because if all the worlds currencies crash at once, you are screwed. In the real world, if all the worlds currency crashes at once, you are going to have one hell of a time getting whoever is holding your paper gold to redeem it anyway, so I figure 6 one half dozen the other.\n \n Personally, I llike god and silver because if you are buying physical product and it it either ungraded or below 99.9% pure, it is cheaper than dirt. I dabble in my lab with various methods of purifying/extracting pure gold or silver. One of my favorites is (simplified) to disolve the item in Hg, then boil the HG off (vacuum, not heat) and what you are left with is pure Silver, or gold. For my last experiment, I started with 70 oz of silver that I bought on Ebay. It was old chinese stuff of unknown purity. Total cost was $184. After putting it through my little refining process, I ended up with 61 OZ of pure silver. Market value=$688 minus a $15 fee to have it assayed.\n \n Not something that you are going to make a lot of money doing, but if you have the equipment (my equipment was left over from an electrohydrodynamic drive experiment I was working on), it is a cheap, and kind of fun way, to increase your emergency cash supply. It works with gold, too, but there is an additonal step involved. The up side of doing gold is that you can get nuggets for $20/oz, and often the profit margin on gold is higher.\n \n Take the finished product, toss it in your safe (mine is actually just stacked on a shelf in my lab) and you have a pretty comfortable cushion for a rainy day before long. \n \n I always get mine assayed and stamped, but I have never sold any of it.

Naturally they don't want all that paper to become worthless overnight, so they keep buying dollars to keep it from falling and to prevent their dollars from literally becoming worthless paper.\n Well at least they did that untill recently.

Basically the US is monetizing it's own debt.\n \n Another explanation is that the world as a whole cannot allow the dollar to collapse. If it were to happen it would mean the total collapse of the world monetary system. The dollar is still the worlds reserve currency and eventhough the Euro is gaining in strenght there is no real replacement for the dollar.

The first step in that determination is an assessment of financial statement reliability and validity. Borrowing from the social security public trust for general operating expenses would put corporate officers and directors in the slammer, that's the equivalent of using 941 withholding taxes to pay operating expenses. That said, politicians have learned to easily manipulate the public.\n \n There are two generally accepted definitions of insolvency, liabilities exceeding assets or balance sheet insolvency, and inability to pay debts, equitable insolvency.\n \n Governments generally accept annual GDP as a country's assets and existing national debt as liabilities. Government accountants are prone to use double speak for the liability side, public debt, national debt, etc. (the political influence), but in the real world debt is debt. With a 2004 GDP of $11.4-trillion and national debt of $8-trillion, the US is not balance sheet insolvent. \n Several countries are technically balance sheet insolvent, but in global economics equitable insolvency is the determining factor, can the country service its debt.\n \n The US is servicing our debt by expanding credit to make debt payments. In the business world creditors long ago would have forced us into bankruptcy reorganization, more likely dissolution to recover assets. The fact remains that we're important to the economies of other nations (not nearly as important as many would like to believe) and calling our debt is an impossibility as GDP can not be converted to tangible assets. So they make do with our bond interest and failing currency.\n \n Pretty basic scenario, as our creditworthiness deteriorates due to decreasing tax revenues and abnormal deficit spending, creditors demand higher interest rates to accept our debt. As monetary inflation through expanded debt decreases USD value, even higher interest rates are demanded to offset USD loses. The criterion for US solvency is how high can our interest rates go to service debt using available tax revenue and available debt without crashing the domestic, transaction oriented GDP. \n \n We've stepped on our you know what. There's no easy fix, or any fix other than an eventual general economic depression as our leadership has maneuvered us into a corner. The only question is how long other countries will support our binge to maintain our impossibly high standard of living using personal and public debt, and that's dependent on how long our currency retains enough value to service debt that becomes more and more expensive. Government lingo is now focused on the elasticity of debt, using military aggression and global threats to drive GDP, but the simple fact exists that we're a debtor nation using a majority of the world's available natural resources with no hope of endless perpetuation of our circumstances. When is the only question of insolvency and the USD fate.",

   "The thing is that Asian countries hold vast amounts of dollars (hundreds of billions). Naturally they don't want all that paper to become worthless overnight, so they keep buying dollars to keep it from falling and to prevent their dollars from literally becoming worthless paper.\n Well at least they did that untill recently. These days the biggest buyers of US Treasuries are Carribean banking centers and the Bank of England. This sends all kinds of alarm signals going off in my head. Rumour has it that they are just front men buying up the Treasuries for the Federal Reserve. I refuse to believe that Cocaine Carlos, Poppy Pablo and the Brits suddenly have taken\n an interest in buying up devaluating paper. Basically the US is monetizing it's own debt.\n \n \n\n \n The bank of england is understandable. The UK is closely enough tied to the US that there is no chance they will survive a devaluation of the dollar and the decline of th US. Their own economy is in pretty bad shape from a realistic standpoint, largely being driven by their own housing bubble. \n \n The caribean banking centers are indeed suspicions. Nobody banks in the caribean unless their primary motivation is anonymous trading/money warehousing. While I suppose it is possible that there is an incredibly rich drug lord out there somewhere who is buying up fistfulls of dollars, I kind of doubt it. \n \n I know the asians are trying to manipulate the dollar. That is pretty obvious just watching trade volume while the asian markets are open, and the trades being made. It seems like several folks in the ME are doing the same (most notably the sauds) . The chinese are playing a rather dangerous game of pumping the dollart then turning around and trying to unload them without dropping the value significantly. \n \n There are a LOT of dollars out there, and people holding those dollars do not want to take a 70% hit on them. The time ill come, though,t hat the dollar will have to be allowed to fall. You just cannot keep it artificially high forever. With the increased buying of oil in Euros, the Sadus loose their incentive to bleed for the dollar. The chinese have switched to a basket of currencies for their reserve (like many other nations) and are slowly loosing thier incentive to keep the dollar up.",

Americans would not handle it well. \n \n \n \n You are describing America as well. Gas prices went up, and credit card debt mirrored the increase. XXXXXX are using their credit cards to buy gas, then carrying the balance! What kind of XXXXX do you have to be to charge, and carry a balance, on consumables????\n\n \n Wait until many of them discover their home equity could also be labeled a consumable.",

   "Personally, when I am looking at gold and silver, I am generally considering \"currency of last resort\". As such, I prefer to put it in my safe as opposed to buying it on paper (archaic, I know). Uranium has storage problems, like you need a really heavy safe and I am sure there is a permit process. I generally just play the currency market to protect against inflation. I have been told that there is a lot fo danger in that because if all the worlds currencies crash at once, you are screwed. In the real world, if all the worlds currency crashes at once, you are going to have one hell of a time getting whoever is holding your paper gold to redeem it anyway, so I figure 6 one half dozen the other.\n \n Personally, I llike god and silver because if you are buying physical product and it it either ungraded or below 99.9% pure, it is cheaper than dirt. I dabble in my lab with various methods of purifying/extracting pure gold or silver. One of my favorites is (simplified) to disolve the item in Hg, then boil the HG off (vacuum, not heat) and what you are left with is pure Silver, or gold. For my last experiment, I started with 70 oz of silver that I bought on Ebay. It was old chinese stuff of unknown purity. Total cost was $184. After putting it through my little refining process, I ended up with 61 OZ of pure silver. Market value=$688 minus a $15 fee to have it assayed.\n \n Not something that you are going to make a lot of money doing, but if you have the equipment (my equipment was left over from an electrohydrodynamic drive experiment I was working on), it is a cheap, and kind of fun way, to increase your emergency cash supply. It works with gold, too, but there is an additonal step involved. The up side of doing gold is that you can get nuggets for $20/oz, and often the profit margin on gold is higher.\n \n Take the finished product, toss it in your safe (mine is actually just stacked on a shelf in my lab) and you have a pretty comfortable cushion for a rainy day before long. \n \n I always get mine assayed and stamped, but I have never sold any of it. It is more a hobby than anything else.\n\n \n Hum, you purify Au and AG in your home with Hg. Ever heard of the mad hatter? He played with Hg too. :)",

Those are not pretty numbers.\n \n Personally, I think they need to throw in whole heartedly with the EU. Sure, they don't want to be ruled by Germany, but at this point there is not a whole lot of choice in the matter, let the krauts rule you or watch your country sink.\n \n I think what puts the british in a worse situation than the Us is their currency. While other nations are willing to take at least moderate steps to ensure the dollar does not crash and burn, nobody has enough of a stake in the pound to care one way or the other. If you watch the pound, it pretty mcuh moves wit the euro, very rarely do you see any significant movement. This seems largely to be based on the fatc that most of the world already sees the British as wholly in the EU. \n \n Based on some of the recent stuff we have seen, and on my conversations with some of my British friends, it seems this may not be the case. Without the EU, the UK is nothing on the world stage as far as an economic power goes. Whereas the dolalr has at least some resiliancy built in by nature of the fact that it is the worlds reserve currency, the pound could crash and burn tommorow and nobody would mourne its death, except perhaps for the british.",
