   "I was just wondering why some people have to seek people out and tell them stuff about religion? I mean, it would be one thing if people asked, but about those other people who have to come to your door and threaten you...\n\n I&#8217;ll take a shot at the threatening part first, Ladywolf &#8211; it&#8217;s wrong, no matter what belief they hold. Shut the door in their face and call the cops.\n Now, if any form of religion turns you off, then that could be your feelings telling you that they are threatening you. Your not wrong, but neither are they &#8211; it&#8217;s just that you see it as a threat; they see it as doing their duty. The literal threatening, however, should never be tolerated under any circumstances.\n \nI don't believe in the devil. I don't believe there is a hell. I don't believe I will be \"judged\" by some invisible God aftere I die. After I die, my body will be donated to science and the remains will be placed in a box to decompose.\n\n That&#8217;s your choice, and your freedom to tell them that the moment you answer the door. It should be a signal to even the most honest, sincere person that you have no intentions of listening to them. Again, after you tell them your point of view, they should go or stay and be carted off.\n \nI also don't like it when people try and \"convert\" me from what I am now, to something they think is better.\n\n That&#8217;s the same scenario as above, but a little deeper in the woods. If you allow them to start their spiel (or variety of conversion) then that&#8217;s your first mistake (or blessing depending on one&#8217;s view). To a Christian it&#8217;s their job to &#8220;seek and save&#8221; &#8211; even though they know that only Jesus is able to do the saving. So-called Christians seem to want to carry the card, but appear to have forgotten Scripture when it comes time to leave &#8211; they just keep babbling. If you tell a Christian that you don&#8217;t care to hear about the Gospel, then they leave right away.\n You might want to mention Mathew 10 : 16 &#8211; just that, not the scripture itself.\n \nI have a right, just as everyone else has a right to believe what they want, and say what they want, but to be mean spirited and evil by telling someone awful things will happen to them if they don't change their ways is totally immoral.\n\n I agree.\n \nSo why do these people have to do this?\n\n The mean-spirited ones? I guess they have some hidden agenda or need to meet their religious quota. I would put up with mean-spirited people just long enough to let them know who their father is.",

   "Tell them you shoot every third person that comes to the door testifying, and the second guy just left a minute ago, :) \n On a more serious note, Big Orn hit it on the nailhead again, NO one has the right to make you uncomfortable in your own home. For safety reasons, ( more because of all the hideous crimes today against women) , I have convinced my wife to never open the door to ANY male, unless she knows them. If they are that important, they can call on the phone, or send us a letter. Once that door is opened to a stranger, the game is up . Better safe , than sorry,",

What gives you the right to do this?\n \n People with conviction are, I believe, often worthy of respect, especially in this day and age where some might have no real beliefs in anything.\n \n If you really believed you had 'the answer', wouldn't you be remiss not to go and tell other people? Some act out of this belief that they are helping you.\n \n If you don't want to hear them, don't open the door. Personally, I have an AD/DC single \"Thunderstruck\" handy by the old turn-table, and when they come, I play this, and often I don't even have to open the door :)",

Their \"income\" is based on their congregation size, their \"membership\", as is, in many ways, their \"power\".\n \n It's reasonable to assume that an average human in such a position would push to recruit more people to grow their business, increasing their power and wealth, while performing a service that people pay \"willingly\" for. If each person on average tithes X % of their income...well get out their and recruit!!!\n \n In the same way, observe how advertisers of goods and services do the same. You walk into their store, they try to convince you of things. You turn on the TV, they try to make you come to their way of thinking...all because they need to, if they want to survive as a business. Some even go door to door, right? It's all the same. No soliciting goes for anything, it's rude when not done appropriately IMO. If you went TO the chruch, it's more acceptable. If you're just getting hammered on the street, they are being rude, IMO, regardless of what their issue is.\n \n \n -Mach",
