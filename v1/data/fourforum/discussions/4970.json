   "\n So why didn't you call the judge who presided over the Peterson trial a activist judge? \n \n \n Little man I hate to respond to your posts but your always so wrong...........\n \n I will do it this one time though........Try and concentrate like a laser for once in your life.........\n \n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,115825,00.html\n \n Bush Signs 'Laci and Conner's Law'\n Friday, April 02, 2004\n \n WASHINGTON - President Bush on Thursday signed into law a bill that would make it a separate crime to kill or harm an unborn child during an assault on the mother.\n \n \n As of today, the law of our nation will acknowledge the plain fact that crimes of violence against a pregnant woman often have two victims,\" Bush said before the signing of the measure.\n \n \"The death of an innocent unborn child has too often been treated as a detail in one crime but not a crime in itself,\" the president said.\n \n The Unborn Victims of Violence Act (search) makes it a crime to harm a fetus during an assault on a pregnant woman. Bush signed the bill, which took five years to get through Congress, in an elaborate Rose Garden ceremony.\n \n \u0095 Raw Data: Unborn Victims of Violence Act (FindLaw)\n \n The controversial measure, which gained new support following the 2002 murder of a pregnant Laci Peterson (search), is also called \"Laci and Conner's law.\" The California woman was eight months pregnant with a son who was to be named Conner when she disappeared on Christmas Eve. Laci Peterson's husband, Scott Peterson (search), has been charged with murder. California is one of 29 states with fetus protection laws.\n \n \"All who knew Laci Peterson have mourned two deaths and the law cannot look away and pretend there was just one,\" Bush said.\n \n Standing behind Bush in the East Room of the White House were a number of prominent lawmakers and people whose pregnant daughters had been slain. Bush focused on one family in particular: that of Laci Peterson.\n \n \"All who knew Laci Peterson have mourned two deaths and the law cannot look away and pretend there is just one,\" Bush said.\n \n \"They have laid to rest their daughter, Laci, a beautiful young woman who was joyfully awaiting the arrival of a new son ... This little soul never saw light but he is loved and he is remembered and his name is forever enjoined with that of his mother.\"\n \n The bill only applies during commission of federal crimes, such as a terrorist attack or drug-related shooting, and only when it is being committed against the pregnant mother.\n \n The bill defines an \"unborn child\" as a child in utero, which means \"a member of the species homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.\"\n \n That definition angers abortion rights supporters, who say the legislation defines life as starting at the point of conception and therefore confers person-status to the fetus. They add that the law will threaten a woman's right to choose.\n \n \"The bill President Bush has signed into law today is yet another example of the misleading tactics that opponents of a woman's right to choose are willing to employ,\" Vicki Saporta, president of the National Abortion Federation (search), said in a statement.\n \n \"The bill's supporters claim they are trying to protect women from violence, yet they refused to allow any real violence prevention measures, or even aid to victims, into the bill.\"\n \n The bill specifically states that legal abortions are not a crime, but critics fear the way it defines life could provide a legal precedent for those who would outlaw the procedure. The Senate narrowly rejected an amendment by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., that would have imposed the same penalties on assailants without referring to the legal status of a fetus.\n \n \"This law rights a blatant and indefensible wrong by establishing what everyone already knows - that these children were here,\" House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (search), R-Texas, said in a statement. \"With the president's signature, common sense and common decency are finally placed into law.\"\n \n Abortion opponents welcome the law as a step toward more protections for the unborn. Bush said he supported the legislation though he did not think the country was headed toward banning abortions.\n \n Bush has said he opposes abortions except in cases of rape or incest or when pregnancy endangers a woman's life. That position has become a standard line in most of his speeches.\n \n \"We stand for a culture of life",

   "Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson says that \"out-of-control\" federal judges are the greatest threat to national survival in our history, more so than Islamic terrorists, Nazi Germany and the Civil War.\n \n While absorbing that breathtaking claim, it's worth weighing the nature and the sins of Robertson's robed devils.\n \n While Robertson and others on the Christian right have an obsession over \"liberal\" and \"activist\" judges on the federal bench, the facts paint a different picture.\n \n Of 811 active federal judges, according to the Federal Judicial Center, well over half were nominated by Republican presidents. The higher the court, the more likely it is that the nomination originated on the conservative side of American politics.\n \n Of the nine members on the U.S. Supreme Court, seven were nominated by Presidents Ronald Reagan or George H.W. Bush. Only two had Democrat Bill Clinton as their benefactor. \n \n One of those, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the only Jewish member of the court, came in for particular scorn from Robertson. He accused her of consorting with communists because she once represented the American Civil Liberties Union.\n \n No matter where one comes down on that outlandish claim, it's far overrating Ginsburg's influence to suggest that her presence alone adds up to a court dominated by liberal activists.\n \n Moving down a layer to the federal appeals courts, 94 of the present 152 active judges were nominated by Republican presidents, vs. just 68 by Democrats. The appeals courts aren't bastions of liberalism either.\n \n At the lowest rung, Republican nominees dominate as well. Of the current 650 district judges, 348 were nominated by a GOP president, just 302 by a Democrat. \n \n What this makes clear is that Robertson wants more than conservative jurists; he wants a particular brand of conservative jurist. What brand? Robertson's statements suggest several criteria:\n \n - One that would dismantle separation between religion and the state.\n \n - One that would reverse Roe vs. Wade, which affirmed a right of privacy in abortion decisions. \n \n - One that contains homosexuality and stem-cell research and would, as in the Terri Schiavo case, elevate a state interest in the extension of life above private interests. \n \n In sum, what Robertson wants is less a nation freed from activist judges than one committed to evangelical Christian activism. \n \n As currently constituted, the federal judiciary is a fluid, dynamic institution dominated by individuals grounded in mainstream conservatism. What Robertson finds more threatening than Sept. 11 terrorists is the refusal of a judicial majority to bend the Constitution to theological beliefs.\n \n The problem with the federal judiciary in Robertson's world isn't an overabundance of activism. It's a lack of activism of the sort he wants.\n http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=85862&ran=12435",

Close scrutiny of these reports however show several factors that cast doubt on their claims. For example, many of the claims come from organizations with an ideological perspective which condemns homosexuality. Furthermore, their claims are poorly documented. For example, treatment outcome is not followed and reported overtime as would be the standard to test the validity of any mental health intervention.\n \n The American Psychological Association is concerned about such therapies and their potential harm to patients.  In 1997, the Association's Council of Representatives passed a resolution reaffirming psychology's opposition to homophobia in treatment and spelling out a client's right to unbiased treatment and self-determination. Any person who enters into therapy to deal with issues of sexual orientation has a right to expect that such therapy would take place in a professionally neutral environment absent of any social bias. \n",
