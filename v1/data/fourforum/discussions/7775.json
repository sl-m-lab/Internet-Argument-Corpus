It is exactly these type of people, who push thier evil values, that is ruining this country. What theses evagelical nuts don't realize that it is the support for their agenda is why the republicans are in trouble. No one likes to have their lives dictated to them by a small number of evil religious control freaks, such as Tony Perkins, and James Dobson.",

Matthew S says she doens't want our lives run by James Dobson...he would rather it be run by himself and certainly not the constitution. \n \n I wonder if you will ever realize that you are the exactly the same as James Dobson. You should be saying \"no one wants an extremist running our country\"",

I just want the equal right to be as nasty to them as they are to me. If they can do it I should be equally able to also. See you do not understand that I do not care about the right or wrong of a situation. It is equality and only equality first that I care about. Equality first right and wrong second. What part of that do you not understand?",
