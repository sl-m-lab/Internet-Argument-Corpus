   "The reputation of any currency is a matter of opinion.\n \n The value of a currency, (similar to many goods) is somewhat dependent upon buyers&#8217; opinions; we&#8217;re uncomfortable considering the extent of subjectivity that&#8217;s factored into the value of any currency.\n \n If those who pretend to manage governments&#8217; currencies honestly consider the consequences of panic, they must often suffer and are awaken from their nightmares.\n \n Panic is powerful force; a currency can power dive driven by panic. Fearing the repercussions due to legislators&#8217; publicly considering default of U.S. debts is not a foolish consideration.\n \n Brazil&#8217;s experience demonstrates the great extent of opinions effect upon currencies values.\n It&#8217;s a remarkable story. \n How Fake Money Saved Brazil : Planet Money : NPR\n \n Respectfully, Supposn",
