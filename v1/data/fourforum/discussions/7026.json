As for Jo Bennets comment, this is just false. I personally don't believe in flag burning but you have a constitutional right to that. I'm not a huge fan of Larry Flynt saying Jerry Falwell had sex with his mother in a n outhouse but he has a constitutional right to do so... I don't understand why some people don't get that maybe they believe the courts should do something besides force their personal views on others, being as they are not elected...now if they were elected such as a congressman, they can force views on people as that is their job.",
