   "What if a couple got pregnant, and they could not assume financial responsibility? What if that was the major deciding factor in their decision to abort? \n \n Could a program work where the couple went through a process to determine that they were not capable of carrying a child to term in the financial sense, not to mention be able to care properly after birth, and the state/local/federal gov't provided a subsidy for them? A time limit on the subsidy?\n \n Would it make a difference if the couple had been using birth control, and it failed?\n \n Just wanted to know what others think. Thank you.",

VOR is right about something!\n \n There are a pleothra of charitis that will pay the bills to help a woman carry her baby to term. More than enought to handle every abortion carried out in the US each year. Additionally, the number of couples willing to pay all medical bills, room and board for the mother and a monthly stipend in order for a chance to adopt the baby is staggering. \n \n Just in our little town, there are 7 differnet organizations that cater to young women who need help, including footing the bill for pregnancies.

   "Having an abortion really depends on the many factors in a woman's life at that present moment when she finds out she is pregnant. There's the idea of financial stability, yes and I agree that that is why many women do abort; but there are women who do this for different reasons. You can't forget to include maturity and the emotional stabilty of the parent/parents to have a child... is it even possible that they will be able to raise a child properly and in humane conditions? \n Another factor to consider is that there are those out there who use abortion as a terms of contreception. Even if we could say 'let the mother have the child and give it up for adoption', can you really ever part with your own flesh and blood? Having a child growing in your womb for 9 months is very maternal feeling. That feeling can not be taken away or abolished at the drop of a hat to give up a baby for adoption or a foster home or the like. Even with giving the child away these feelings are still inate.\n To have an abortion is purely the choice of the mother of the child; can she live with herself for doing so and if she was to have the baby could she part with afterwards or give it the life it deserves? \n Financial burdens being lessened somehow would make a difference but only in some cases not all. Being pregnant is a really scary thing. Though we all have our 'this is what I would do ideals/ abortions is.... critques' one can never fully have certainty in those feelings unless YOU are placed in that situation. Personal experience changes everything. I don't want to come off as a Pro abortionist because I am not, but one can only make a firm desicion in this matter with intimate exposure to the situation.\n \"Please all, and you will please none.\"-Aesop",
