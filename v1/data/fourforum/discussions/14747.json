   "These are some excerpts from a Ted talk about beauty and evolution.\n \n \nAcheulian hand axes. The oldest stone tools are choppers from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa. They go back about two and a half million years. These crude tools were around for thousands of centuries, until around 1.4 million years ago when Homo erectus started shaping single, thin stone blades, sometimes rounded ovals, but often in, what are to our eyes, an arresting, symmetrical pointed leaf or teardrop form. These Acheulian hand axes -- they're named after St. Acheul in France, where finds were made in 19th century -- have been unearthed in their thousands, scattered across Asia, Europe and Africa, almost everywhere Homo erectus and Homo ergaster roamed.\n \n The Homo erectus that made these objects did not have language. It's hard to grasp, but it's an incredible fact. This object was made by a hominid ancestor -- Homo erectus or Homo ergaster -- between 50 and 100,000 years before language.\n\n The thought of a creature that can not speak, sitting there on a rock on a warm summer day shaping a hand ax, gives me a wonderfully eerie feeling.\n \n The rest of it was pretty good as well.\n \n Denis Dutton: A Darwinian theory of beauty | Video on TED.com",
