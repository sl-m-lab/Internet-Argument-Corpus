(which should be something you'd WANT to hear.) She's the one running for president.\n\n \n \nLast night the Minnesota Republican seemed to contradict herself when it came to gay marriage - saying she wouldn't work to overturn gay marriage in states that have passed it like Iowa and New Hampshire. But she also said she was for a constitutional amendment to reserve marriage to men and women. This morning I asked her to clarify:\n \n Stephanopoulos: Gay marriage - at first you suggested that you don't think that state laws that legalize gay marriage should be overturned. And then there are states, both Iowa and New Hampshire have legalized -\n \n Bachmann: No George, George the question that I was asked was if I was President of the United States would I come into the states that passed that legislation and advocate either for or against a state law. And as President of the United States that would not be my roll to advocate for or against a state law.\n \n Stephanopoulos: Right but you later said you were for a constitutional amendment - a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage would have the affect of overturning state law.\n \n Bachmann: Well in my home state I was the chief author of a constitutional amendment to define marriage as between a man and a woman. That's consistently been my position. And I do support that position at a federal level. But what the questioner asked me is if as President of the United States I would come into a state and advocate either for or against a state law and I said that I would not do that. I believe in the 10th Amendment and I believe in Federalism.\n \n Stephanopoulos: But you believe in a constitutional amendment which would overturn the state law?\n \n Bachmann: I believe in the constitutional amendment, but also one thing I do know on the DOMA law, that's the Defense of Marriage Act, President Obama has said as the President of the United States who swore that he would faithfully execute the laws of the United States, he said he would pick and choose and not select, not enforce laws that are on the books. That's why we are seeing a movement toward a federal marriage Amendment because President Obama won't even stand up for a law that President Clinton signed and passed into law and that's the Defense of Marriage Act which would preserve marriage between one man and one woman.\n Coming Off Strong Debate Michele Bachmann Takes the High Road - George Stephanopoulos' Bottom Line\n \n\n Yes, you are correct that she supports the decisions of states in regards to gay marriage. However, she also supports federal legislation and/or a constitutional amendment bannng gay marriage...which would invalidate the state decisions. Can't get much more contradictory than that. \n \n Bachmann is a lunatic.",

The reality is gay people are forming these bonds, like heterosexuals, sometimes with children. Also, these are sexual orientations, gay and straight(as opposed to paraphilias, yes I know gays were once put in that class but we determined it was wrong to place gays there). They are the fundamental means by which groups of people express their human sexuality(to treat one as lesser on that basis wouldn't be empathetic) . One is the majority, one is the minority. However, we don't discriminate based on a numbers argument alone. The principle that no one could possibly be harmed by the behaviour in and of itself, also comes into play in our reasoning. You can't argue against it without using diversions of incest, only meant to cause greater fear, is not a reason to discriminate, to treat the gay group differently than the heterosexual group. As you see, a series of principles are involved which get us to make a moral determination as to why gay should be treated equal to straight. And that argument of gay being equal to straight is the one we are making. Non-discrimination is also a principle. I'm applying it to the issue of gay straight relations in this society. \n \n \nWhen people go to extremes or ask questions about related cases they are often asking for the principle behind a position, by taking shots in the dark they try to work out the shape of the other's positions and thereby induct a standard.

Even if you accept this as true, there are still good reasons behind why gays are motivated, and some of those reasons would have had to convince the heterosexual majority for gay rights to move forward.

You needn't re-set all standards to accept homosexuality. You just need to show homosexuality has no basis for being wrong. Because it deviates from the majority or tradition acceptance is a flimsy reason. I'm going to copy and paste from a link which states this case quite well. \n \n \nDo you seriously think that answers the question?\n\n \n Yes. It's part of our empirical reasoning on the subject of gays specifically, when we see gays functioning in society at the same level as heterosexuals.\n \n \nAlright then, what differentiates an 'orientation' from a 'paraphilia'? because as far as I can tell it's the size of the political movement behind it.\n\n \n That's totally wrong.

It points to how it is a different issue.\n \n \nThis vision of naturalistic determinism doesn't seem to match reality, once it was thought that heterosexuality was a natural inevitability and they labeled anything else perversion.\n\n \n You're arguing for what traditionally was according to social custom.

It's fundamental sexuality, so it appeals on that level.\n \n \n I don't care about numbers at all.\n \n \n \nBut that's not true even for heterosexual sex.\n\n \n Yes, it doesn't cause any harm in and of itself.\n \n \nYou act as if you understand fear of incest yet you expect that no one should fear homosexuality, why?\n\n \n They know people don't fear homosexuality, which is why they bring up incest.\n \n \n \nA series of princibles?\n It's fundamental\n Don't discriminate.\n Other deviations are distractions (which still implies you don't have a standard to judge sexual behavior by)\n \n It lacks no meaning when you claim it only applies to that particular thing you are defending you need the particular to satisfy the general. It's like if someone claimed it was immoral but wouldn't tell you why.\n\n \n Again, you're looking for one moral absolute, without presenting one. It does avoid why homosexuality should be seen as immoral. We needn't have an entire morality reset to accept one aspect, homosexuality as moral.\n \n \nSex to produce offspring is natural, and the biological function of sex; there can be no argument against that. Deviations off of that are deviation. That does not rely on numbers.\n\n \n It's not always the moral thing, to reproduce, even if it is natural.\n \n \nNo deviation from primary sexual behavior.\n \n \n I know and it's silly, I really despise people who see disagreements as a game in semantics.\n \n \n Basicaly, but more than that other deviations are much less stressful to keep underground for various reasons. Homosexuals don't see a choice though, and it was a chain reaction of less and less fear of social reprise. As soon as there was 10 people willing to claim that they weren't perverted nutcases, that was enough to force psychologist to revise (I am not saying there were only 10 but the point is very few brave people are enough to start the reaction).\n\n \n And homosexuality went through an empirical process of examining social science and reason. The other things haven't gone through that process. So we have no means of comparison to homosexuality which aren't very flimsy or perhaps based on fantasized \"what ifs\".",

   "This link from the American Philosophical Association is discussing the legal test of rational basis, but it deals with the moral issues as well(bolding is mine)--\n \n \nAsserting baldly that the courts must defer to legislatures, given \"widespread moral disapproval of same-sex relations\" (Sunstein, 6), avoids the constitutional inquiry that judges have already made in numerous cases, and are obliged to undertake. Specifically, is the particular morality that the law happens to reflect constitutionally permissible, rational, and humane? As Andrew Koppelman has noted, \"[T]he post-Civil War Southern Black Codes which, for example, made it a crime for a black to be insolent or disrespectful toward a white . . . undeniably rested on powerful moral convictions . . . The trouble was not with the fact that these laws legislated morality, but with the kind of morality that they legislated.\"15\n \n The Court's hands thus are not tied whenever morality is at stake; consequently, a claim of irrationality is justiciable, even if the Court's most common response to it is deference to the democratic process. As such, a thin, rational basis argument, supplemented by the work of Judge Posner and others who attack the empirical bases of anti-gay legislation, may be an especially effective approach to advancing gay rights claims. These empirical arguments help to destabilize many of the dominant legal and moral theories about sex and sexuality. Although they do not necessarily assist in framing a new, authoritative account of sexuality to replace the old one, they do tend to show (and this is sufficient) that many of the arguments commonly advanced in support of official regulation against homosexuality are just too flimsy to support anti-gay regulation, much of which interferes with basic, essentially private, decisions such as whom to love and marry, with whom to have sexual relations, or which religious account of sexuality to embrace.\n \n This approach would emphasize that our constitutional practices demonstrate that a Devlinesque assertion that the state may enforce the majority's conception of morality, taken alone, does not justify any and all anti-gay legislation. Nor does the fact that homosexuals historically have been subject to discrimination and prejudice justify continued discrim-ination, because courts have acknowledged that \"[n]ot all historical practices are good, and prejudices often persist.\"16\n\n \n Thick and Thin Arguments for Gay Constitutional Rights \n \n As the article nearer the end says, it doesn't answer the most pertinent question of why homosexuality is wrong.",

   "The trouble was not with the fact that these laws legislated morality, but with the kind of morality that they legislated.\"15\n\n At least someone has a brain over there :p If any idiot tells you that laws shouldn't legislate morality, ask them to produce a law not based on some one's idea of morality.\n \n \nAlthough they do not necessarily assist in framing a new, authoritative account of sexuality to replace the old one\n\n Ah! here is where my problem lies.\n \n \nThis approach would emphasize that our constitutional practices demonstrate that a Devlinesque assertion that the state may enforce the majority's conception of morality, taken alone, does not justify any and all anti-gay legislation.\n\n I would like to emphasize that the majorities conception of morality is zero justification taken alone or with any number of other factors.\n \n Did you read this part?:\n \nHomosexuality may well be \"like incest\" to the extent that laws often reflect reigning moral intuitions that we do not tend to explore or seek to justify beyond bald assertions of disgust.\n\n We need to start to tend to explore, or the issue in general; including homosexuality will just sit right there on the same notch 'bald assertions of disgust'.\n \n \nLikewise, the abstract claims about neutrality, equality, or liberalism do not tell us what to do, ultimately or precisely, about homosexuality (or, for that matter, about any other question on the margins of what most people would regard as unreasonable official coercion of individual behavior).\n\n (addressing the author) They tell some of us what to do, the rest of you are following the majority and a piece of paper like a bible.\n \n \nThese attacks on the definitional and empirical assumptions that drive the prohibition of same-sex relations, when advanced within a rational basis argument, best expose the relevant question: \"What is wrong with homosexual conduct?\" \n\n Stupid article is looking for some absolute moral answer emoticon_cool\n \n \nThe thick framework thus narrows the relevant legal question to an essentially factual one: Does homosexual identity or conduct present a sufficient, verifiable, and not merely aesthetic (the \"mere offense\" insight of the First Amendment) peril to society, such that government can regulate against it, despite the harms such regulation obviously occasions for the citizens it affects? The thin approach then poses the factual question directly and forces the courts to answer it as objectively as possible.\n\n So, you going for the 'thick' approach? Is your standard of sexual behavior 'whether it present a sufficient verifiable and not merely aesthetic peril to society'?\n \n Or are you going 'thin' in which case you will simply answer the question which I keep asking.\n \n \nRather, he would draw the line between public and private acts quite starkly, such that government could not regulate private consensual acts but could regulate or prohibit \"the advertising or marketing of homosexual services, the maintenance of places of resort for homosexual activity, or the promotion of homosexual <lifestyles' via education and public media of communication, or . . . homosexual <marriages' or . . . the adoption of children by homosexually active people, and so forth\" (Finnis, 1076).\n\n He affords the government rights it does not have, you see it doesn't matter if it's public or private, all that matter is that it's consensual. And trade is consensual.\n \n \n\n As the article nearer the end says, it doesn't answer the most pertinent question of why homosexuality is wrong.\n\n So because of that you feel just fine about not answering the question yourself (positive or negative)?",

   "Just because they aren't of heterosexual status. A flimsy reason in and of itself, also found by one of the judges in the link I posted.\n\n You think you've discovered something? Of course because they aren't heterosexual, that was the problem. By the same token that you think any thing else but homosexuality is a 'distraction' someone could claim that you demanding that their opinion on homosexuality have any kind of general justification (the 'why') is also a distraction.\n \n \n \nThat's pretty weak.\n\n I know but that's your story and you seem to be sticking to it.\n \n \nYou're being too vague here, saying it's dependent on the supporter.

The experts don't say gays are worse as parents.\n\n Take it up with gansao.\n \n \nBecause you connected heterosexuality in some way to rape. \n\n Rape is either homosexual or heterosexual, but more importantly it is sexual. So it belongs in a consideration of sexual morality.\n \n \nI could have used a less polite word to describe your claim, but chose overly broad.\n\n but you still haven't described overly broad like I asked.\n \n \nYes, well I presented standards and principles for the acceptance of gays. \n\n You said fundamental, if you had presented a standard I would have noticed.\n \n \nYou simply want to take us off topic.\n\n I want you to recognize the topic is sexual morality, I didn't make it that way; the mere fact that you appeal to another class of sexualism as support did. On a deeper level though even if there was only homosexuality you would still need to have a moral principle to have it satisfy it.\n \n \nIn terms of the topic at hand, not everything else.\n\n The topic at hand is what sexual behavior is moral.\n \n \nThe gay bonds are not generally less healthy than heterosexual bonds, and function for the individuals and society. These bonds are not disordered or connected with disorders. \n\n So your standard is 'healthy' and 'ordered'?\n \n \nHa! You show me there is this lack of evidence for the specific topic of incest!\n\n Lack of what evidence? and how do I find nothingness?'\n \n Evidence towards what end? We still have the little problem of the standard don't we.\n \n \nWe have gone through the debate and the reasons, which is why homosexuality was declassified\n\n Homosexuality was declassified because some homosexuals proved they were not mentally ill breaking the description of the 'disorder', don't kid yourself psychologist were forced to the admission by political pressure which they could not face without evidence.\n \n \nthat may not necessarily be applied to everything else you can pull out of your lower intestines.\n\n Again I ask if that is your standard.\n \n \nYes.\n\n So in fact we have three biological imperatives here, each causing unchosen attractions in a person. Where do they come from? How many are there?\n \n \nIt's the only one they have, unchosen.\n\n Would you then define an orientation as a type of unchosen sexual attractions?\n \n \nIncestuous etc., may be gay or straight.\n\n That sounds like an arbitrary statement, it's all sex; you define the difference between hetero and homo to be who's having sex with whom. True that one must have sex either with a male or female but one must also have sex with a sibling or non-sibling, many or one, human or not.\n \n \nPart of it. \n\n What the 'rest' then and how do they interact in your theory.\n \n \nNo you didn't present a moral absolute about sexuality. \n\n I presented a absolute moral theory, I believe the point I am making is that that must be step one in a moral defense or offense. If you had read the second link more thoroughly you might have seen I did apply the general to sexuality, and the point of the thread was to evaluate individual sexualities with the general sexuality.\n \n \nDiscussing everything except homosexuality, to determine the morality of gay relationships or gay anything.\n\n I don't wish to avoid talking about an instance of sexuality, I am complaining about not talking about instances.\n \n \nThere are many reasons which I have presented. The fact that it's not inherently harmful, is one, but there are many others specific to each situation or group.\n\n You have different moral standards for different groups?
