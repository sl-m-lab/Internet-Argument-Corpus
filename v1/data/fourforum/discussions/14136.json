   "Before you ask, the Millionaires are some pop group I found out about when some troll posted them to the All Metal Forums. I don't post on AMF anymore but I still read some threads on it. So I watched 45 seconds of a music video of theirs, I read lyrics from one of their songs called \"Alcohol\", and I came out with this rant on them:\n \n I realize that since I'm about the age the pop industry is targeted to, many of you won't take this rant as seriously as you would if I were older. But I don't feel that my age discredits my opinion, and the accuracy of what I say is the same no matter what age I am.\n \n The reason I'm ranting on the Millionaires is because they're one of the few pop groups that actually make me angry. I'll explain why that is throughout this rant. For emphasis, I've bolded the lyrics that I've found to be especially problematic.\n \n \n(M)Hyphy Crunk, spin that XXXX.\n \n (A)yeah\n (D)MILLIONAIRES.\n (D)that's right.\n \n (M)friday night it's time to party\n (D)drop it down and get real naughty\n (A)girls talk XXXX, we don't care\n (A)we'll take off our underwear!\n \n (D)drinking cocktails,\n (M)beers with lime\n (D)all these guys yell \"she's a dime!\"\n (M)i just wink and blow a kiss\n (A)while all these girls just bitch and diss\n \n (chorus) 2x\n (M)come get XXXXed up!\n (D)give me my alcohol\n (A)let's get XXXXed up!\n (A)A-L-C-O-H-O-L\n \n (M)this bitch is trying to take a shot\n (M)she can't down one, what else she got?\n (D)jaeger, vodka, even whiskey\n (A)down that XXXX, don't be a...\n (D)XXXXX\n \n (M)who needs pepsi, juice, or sprite?\n (A)if you do you're weak (thats right)\n (A)i down my shots and gulp my beers\n (D)til' every drop disappears\n \n (chorus) 2x\n \n (bridge)\n (M)everytime i'm at the bar, you wanna pay\n (M)go ahead, buy me a drink...you won't get laid.\n \n (D)everytime i'm at the bar, you wanna pay\n (D)go ahead, buy me a drink...you won't get laid.\n \n (A)everytime i'm at the bar, you wanna pay\n (A)go ahead, buy me a drink...you won't get laid.\n \n (chorus) 2x\n \n (A)all these boys are drinking ale\n (D)and we bust out White Zinfandel!\n (M)yeah we're getting pretty trashed\n (D)but these boys ain't gettin any XXX\n \n (M)drink every drink that could be tasted\n (M)look at us, we're XXXXin wasted\n (A)we stumble, mumble, no one cares\n (D)just cause we're the MILLIONAIRES!\n \n (chorus) 2x\n (A)A-L-C-O-H-O-L\n \n (drunkin mumbling and slurring hahahahaha)\n\n \n Don't get me wrong, I don't think that risque lyrics are bad in and of themselves. But what irritates me is that there's definitely some impressionable fourteen year old girl out there who thinks she's all rebellious and hardcore because she listens to music with these risque kind of lyrics, and she'll probably follow the advice of these pop idols and drink and party away her early years until she realizes that the bills aren't getting paid; at that point she realizes that it's too late. The pop industry is targeted towards a teenage audience; these are not lyrics that kids should be hearing. I'm not saying that kids should only listen to Kids Bop CDs, but the problem with most pop music today is that they're a musical style targeted towards kids with lyrics that are definitely not for kids. \n \n The Millionaires are a prime example of how the pop industry is destroying America's youth, teaching all this BS about how life is just a big party. It advocates drug and alcohol abuse and promotes promiscuous sex, and the problem is that since pop is targeted to a mainstream audience, most kids who listen to it won't be intelligent or mature enough to realize that the \"party lifestyle\" is not a wise way to live.\n \n I also find the lyrics very degrading to women; once again, not because of the sheer content, but because it's made by girls who are willing to sell themselves into the pop industry as \"boy toys\" to bring in the money. They actually promote and supposedly live a promiscuous lifestyle, and they're setting an example that many kids will follow and end up ruining their whole lives. Through their blatant sluttiness and materialism, the Millionaires have effectively degraded the image of women to nothing more than sex toys and they've s*** on everything that women have fought to achieve for the past 130 years.\n \n Their rat-nest scenester hair and their slutty attitude are meant to draw in a male audience, but the sex appeal in this case only works if the male is a complete neanderthal who can't even see their hideous values and their bland, unoriginal \"music\", if you can call it that. The more primitive the guy is, the more appealing a sexy woman is. He doesn't bother to look at her morbid values, the only thing he sees is big tits and a relatively pretty face beckoning him to shovel out money. The masses these days would rather hear a hot girl who sounds like s*** than an ugly girl who can sing beautifully.\n \n As for their music: it's just another pop group. The same repetitive, bland, unoriginal music you hear in every other group. Like Kesha, they don't even sing, they just talk their way through songs. I know I didn't comment much on the music, but then again there's not much bad to say about them that you can't say about any other pop performers. They're as unoriginal as it gets.\n \n Unfortunately I figure the group will inevitably get a record label and publish some albums; as if there aren't enough scenesters running around the mall. emoticon_mad",
