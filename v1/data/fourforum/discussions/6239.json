   "If you've been following the news you've doubtless seen many stories highlighting repulican politicians publicly denouncing the Iraq war. Obviously they're trying to distance themselves from an unpopular war before election time. Here's what I'm wondering. The GOP has, until now, been very tight knit, with everyone doing and saying what they were supposed to say. Now we have senators attacking Bush's postions. Are these defections, sign of cracks showing in the GOP? Or is it all planned by the party higher ups, with the politicians in question being told just how strong an attack to mount? What do people think?",

   "Regardless of public political statements by Bush deeming polls as unreliable in determining what the public actually thinks, both major political party central committees at state and national levels pay close attention to poll results, repeatedly initiating their own, non-publicized polls to gauge the public mood. \n \n I generally don't follow individual politicians not representing my state, but Engel, the Republican senator now making noise about withdrawing from Iraq is not up for reelection in 2006. For a politician not standing for reelection to make statements against affiliated administration policies is most unusual in that the central committee generally rules with an iron fist. I'd have to believe that his current position is condoned by the central committee for whatever reasons. Presidential timbre? He has all the qualifications and has historically been a party dog. \n \n As to other Republicans who are facing reelection, I don't know their constituent feelings. It is an unpopular war and if their state shows a majority of voters being against that war, the central committee would obviously allow them to follow the public mood to retain their congressional majority. \n \n Regardless of how the public reacts to national policy, their political party is god to politicians as it represents power and money, the sole reason most of them are in politics. To go against party policy generally guarantees retribution.",

   "I also think it's important to point out that the Iraq war is not to the point where it is an election-breaking issue, IMO. It was unpopular in the last election, and yet Bush still won. \n \n America just doesn't consider it another Vietnam, no matter how much that term is floated by various people. And it's right that it shouldn't be considered a Vietnam--it's not even remotely close to it in terms of U.S. casualties and public outrage. And there's no draft, either.",

Public debate within the party is preferred to the rubberstamping that Democrats gave Clinton despite his being impeached.
