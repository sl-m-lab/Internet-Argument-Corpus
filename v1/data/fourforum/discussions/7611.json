   "I've been reading Brian Greene's \"The Elegant universe\", and it's given me a much better understanding of how mass warps space to produce the effects of gravity. I was never quite sure if that was supposed to be an analogy or not, and I now understand, and believe, that mass does indeed warp space. And of course warped space would cause things that would otherwise move in a straight line to change their tragectories. If you warp space, you bend what would otherwise be the straight line that was being followed.\n \n What I don't understand, and would like some insight into, is how warped space induces motion. If I hold an object in a region of warped space and let go of it, what is it about that space that causes the object to move? Can anyone explain?",

Think of it this way; instead of a horizontal sheet, use a rubber wall, and push your heavy ball into it. It's exactly the same analogy, you're just looking at the warp in the XZ plane, instead of the XY plane. Now, put your marble touching the sheet under the ball. Warped space should cause the marble to roll towards the heavy ball, but in actuallity it'll just fall to the floor. Likewise, if after putting your heavy ball on the sheet you froze everything so that it would stay stiff even if you move it you could then rotate your sheet so that any point in the warp seemed \"level\" and you could then get your marble to hold still at any point on the warp.\n \n The rubber sheet analogy works great for me for explaining why trajectories change, because you can see the straight lines bending, but it doesn't convince me about why things start moving from rest.",

This speed it C. A photon has all of it's motion through space, and no motion through time. Photons do not get old in the sense that we humans do. They experience no before or after. If we were to travel to deep space and come to rest with respect to the rest of the universe (I know, just pretend and put aside the conceptual problems this causes)... we would have pretty much zero motion through space... and be rocketing through time at approximately C. You can't escape C. Everything has to travel at C. It is this idea that special (and general) relativity is based on.\n \n Now carry this to the hypothetical situation of a ball resting beside a planet. That planet has warped both space and time around it. That ball starts with all motion through time at speed C, and has no motion at all in space (with respect to the planet). The warping of time and space caused by the planet then distorts space-time so that the shortest path through space-time is now not entirely though time alone... but partly through space.... So the ball obediently starts moving to keep to it's eternal motion at C... with some motion now in space, and some in time. As the ball moves, the curvature of space and time changes as it gets closer to the earth... and the path through space-time is also changed... and so that balls motion through space time changes so that even more motion is dedicated to the spatial direction and even less through time. In this way the ball accelerates towards the planet.\n \n As the ball accelerates it is loosing some component of motion through time, to space. In the case of a black hole the ball can end up with almost all of it's motion through space and almost nothing through time.\n \n Now this does not spell out the awnser as to how the planet affects the ball... it just maps the old problem into a new mechanism... instead of magical \"gravity\" pulling on the ball... magical \"gravity\" warps space-time.
