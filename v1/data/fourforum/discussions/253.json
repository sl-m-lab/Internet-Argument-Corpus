   "matter is the central manifestation of a distortion in the universal field. In order to sustain itself in a state of universal entropy matter must draw energy from this universal field. The effect of this is time space curviture. Gravity is the act of stealing time and space. Apples do not fall from trees the timespace between them disapears.\n \n The problem with the dual nature of energy/matter and its given location with in the continueum is the same as the problem of light speed. That is the universe consists of overlaping distortions with in the contiumeum, ergo there is no induvidual point in time space that has the identical properties of time and space dilation. It was Einstiene that postulated properties would only ever be relitive to the observer.\n \n One is therfore left to difine time and space in ones mind. This is why when asked a spesific question regarding its nature energy/matter always answers in which context are you asking. The problem with science is the phylisophical constraints of the absolute and reductionism.",
