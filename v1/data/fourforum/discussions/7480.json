They are properties of mankind, devised from common sense and experiences of nature. (Logic tells me if I stick my hand in fire, I will get burned.) ...and the fact that people contradict each other has no bearing on the absoluteness of the rules of logic. It merely reflects the failure of many to grasp the rules and play by them.[QUOTE]\n \n \nThey are properties of mankind, devised from common sense and experiences of nature.\n\n \n you are confusing the mind with the universe. Define what \"common sense\" is; common sence is subjective, not absolute. If the laws of logic come from experences of nature, then they can change because peoples experences change. Sticking your hand in the fire in not logic. The laws of logic are not actions. They are statements about conceptual patterns of thought. Though one could say that a law of physics (i.e., the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence) is a statement which is conceptual, it is a statement that describes actual physical and observable behavior. But, logical absolutes are not observable and do not describe behavior or actions of things since they reside completely in the mind. \n We do not observe the laws of logic occurring in matter. You don't watch an object NOT bring itself into existence if it doesn't exist. Therefore, no law of logic can be observed by watching nothing. \n \n We discover laws of physics by observing and analyzing the behavior of things around us. The laws of logic are not the result of observable behavior of object or actions. \n For example, we do not see in nature that something is both itself and not itself at the same time. \n Why? Because we can only observe a phenomena that exists, not one that does not exist. If something is not itself, then it doesn't exist. How then can the property of that non-existent thing be observed? It cannot. \n Therefore, we are not discovering a law of logic by observation, but by thought. \n Or, where do we observe in nature that something cannot bring itself into existence if it does not already exist? \n You cannot make an observation about how something does not occur if it does not exist. You would be, in essence, observing nothing at all and how can any laws of logic be applied to or derived from observing nothing at all? \n \n\n ...and this part:I recall many occasions wherein someone said of a third party, quite truthfully, \"He's not himself today.\" Clearly, he was nobody else and he was still alive, so he was physically himself, but emotionally detached.:)\n\n \n i dont get it, he can say he is someone else but that does not mean that he is someone else, again law of logic are conceptual.\n The laws of logic are not dependent upon different peoples minds since people are different. Therefore, they cannot be based on human thinking since human thinking is often contradictory.",

This does not mean He can violate His own nature. If He did something inconsistent with His nature, then He would be self contradictory. If God were self contradictory, He would not be true.

At dictionary.com, a rock is defined as a \"Relatively hard, naturally formed mineral or petrified matter; stone. a) A relatively small piece or fragment of such material. b) A relatively large body of such material, as a cliff or peak. c) A naturally formed aggregate of mineral matter constituting a significant part of the earth's crust.\" A rock, by definition is not infinitely large. So, to say that the rock must be so big that God cannot pick it up is to say that the rock is no longer a rock. \n What the critics are asking is that God become self contradictory as a proof He doesn't exist. Their assertion is illogical from the start. So what they are doing is trying to get God to be illogical. They want to use illogic to prove God doesn't exist instead of logic. It doesn't work and the \"paradox\" is self-refuting and invalid.\n\n \n That is the most blatant, long winded, tongue twister of an example of moving the goalposts I've ever seen. You've simply defined God to fit the occasion. \n \n Since when did God have a \"nature\"?\n \n Since when are you able to define God's nature? \n \n I thought he was infinite and all powerful?\n \n I've lost any respect I might have had for carm.com.\n \n Waxy\n \n P.S. \"Rock\" is in no way limited by size in its definition (the earth or a pebble, they're both rock), and could conceivable be infinite.",

   "the logic works, but we cant verify it in the physical realm. youll never be able to put 2 groups of 2,000,000,000,000,000,000 hamsters together and count them as you would 4 matchsticks. we know that addition works, and that extrapolation (in this case) would work on the same principles of logic. but you could never verify it physically, since it would be physically impossible. yet it would not be necessary to physical prove the sum. i see your point, but the point is that it can be proven without the use of material objects and what not\n\n \n I agree for the most part. However, without the knowledge and absolute certainty of being able to physically test the hypothesis (2+2=4) and prove it true, we would not be able to use the extrapolation of that hypothesis to derive the answer in your scenario with the same degree of certainty.\n \n I would liken it to the difference between a scientic theory - evolution, gravity, etc.... and mathematics. We can prove absolutely that 2+2=4, despite all of the evidence for evolution, gravity, etc..., they cannot be tested physically or derived using logic to provide absolute certainty. \n \n Without absolute physical proof and the ability to physically, and repeatably, \n test something, it cannot be considered absolute.\n \n Anyhoo, I'm so offtrack, I could be arguing against myself at this point. :) \n \n Waxy",

   "As far as I can tell, this \"logic is abstract and beyond the material, and beyond the human mind, so it must come from God\" idea is no different to Intelligent Design or people who ask \"So what caused the Big Bang?\"\n \n The fact that there are \n \n 1) Things which are so complex that we do not yet understand them\n \n 2) Abstract concepts which cannot be quantified\n \n 3) Laws of logic which exist independent of us\n \n are all intriguing subjects worth talking about, but no matter how many billions of arguments I hear on the subject, not one comes anywhere near convincing me that the only explanation is that God must exist in order for these perplexing aspects of existence to exist.\n The opening post:\n \n \n \n How do atheists account for the laws of logic in a universe without God? The Laws of logic are conceptual by nature and absolute. Being absolute they transcend space and time. They are not the properties of the physical universe (since they are conceptual) or of people (since people contradict each other, which would mean they weren't absolute). So, how do they account for them?\n\n \n OK, I agree that the \"laws of logic\" themselves are conceptual by nature. However the rest of this statement is flawed. The laws of logic that we are aware of are concepts which we have noted as we have become more aware of the way in which the universe works.\n Even though these logical truths would exist independently of us, they would not exist independently of the universe. \n While they are not properties of the physical universe, they are properties of the interactions and possibilities which take place within the universe. They do not have to come from anywhere. They exist as a result of the existence of the universe and its physical configuration, not as a result of the existence of God.\n \n \n Examples of logical absolutes are: something cannot be itself and not itself at the same time (Law of non contradiction). A thing is what it is (Law of identity). A statement is either true or false (Law of excluded middle). These are simple, absolute logical absolutes.\n\n \n Both of your examples are simply the product of the fact that on a macroscopic scale, we live in a highly ordered universe where matter and energy ebb and flow in predictable patterns. Objects and phenomena in our universe obey four basic forces which give rise to all physical interactions, and can be measured and tested, hence cannot be more than one thing at once, and can be shown to have happened or not to have happened. One does not need God at this point in the argument.\n (On the quantum scale however, neither of these statements describe experimental data satisfactorily.)\n \n \n How can absolute, conceptual, abstract laws be derived from a universe of matter, energy and motion?\n In other words, how can an atheist with a naturalistic presupposition account for the existence of logical absolutes when logical absolutes are conceptual by nature and not physical, energy, or motion?\n\n \n Absolute, conceptual, abstract laws are derived from the universe of matter, energy and motion through the working of the human mind.\n Before human minds existed, 2 mountains and two mountains were still 4 mountains, planets followed their orbits, entropy increased. The universe does not need God to tell it how to work, it does it on its own as a result of its own configuration.\n These abstract logical concepts existed before us, but it is us who has termed them \"abstract concepts\", otherwise they are just The Way Things Work.\n \n My comparison to other \"big questions\" was relevant to all this because it is a common phenomenon for people to attribute things we do not fully comprehend to the existence of the Divine. \n \n \n I am intrigued by these questions ADW is posing though, just to see where they go. But \"is it safe to say you know things by sense perception?\" seems like a loaded question to me. You asked \"How do you know things?\" and I think unkerpaulie answered fully and satisfactorily. Where do you go from there?",

Changes from person to person? \n \n \nill answer your follow up question right away. 'knowing\" something by faith is different from \"knowing\" something by evidence, in that it is the opposite. faith is considering a statement to be true at the lack of evidence or in the face of contradictory evidence. i may \"know\" that a hot pot will burn me because i have been told, but havent proven this myself. this \"knowledge\" is based on faith, and continues to be based on faith until i have evidence that this is true. as time goes on and i experience being burnt by pots or understand the mechanics of being burnt by hot pots, i no longer rely on the faith i had in being told, because i have enough evidence to know that it is true for myself\n \n \n an atheist \"knows\" things through evidence. specifically concerning things of god and the supernatural, there is simply no evidence of a consistent and reliable condition. \"evidence\" for god's existence is usually very sporadic and unpredictable, and its simply not consistent enough to be considered evidence, so the statements based thereon are considered not true\n\n \n \nthere is simply no evidence\n\n \n carm makes a good point about this:\n \"There is no proof that God exists\"\n To say \"there is no proof for God's existence,\" is illogical because an atheist cannot know all things by which he could state that there is no proof.

   "\"There is no proof that God exists\" is quite accurate. Only the deepest philosophy will come to the point of seriously debating the fault in the statement, which is that as we are posessed of imperfect knowledge we cannot deny the possibility that some as yet undiscovered proof of god might exist. In this case, we'd modify the statement to \"There is no known proof that God exists.\" However, in the context, what you are doing is not deep philosophy, but nitpicking.\n \n As for the laws of logic, once more I shall try to explain from another angle: logic, mathematics and similar are ways in which we describe the universe. Take an apple. Take another apple. Now you have two apples, but you don't actually have two of the same things. You just recognize that apples are similar one to another and that it is reasonable to invent the nonexistent context of an abstract apple.\n \n While this may be somewhat unclear, it is clarified if you take an apple and a pear. You now have two fruits. However, you will notice that there is no fruit in reality, only apples, pears, peaches and so on. Fruit is an abstract concept. That abstract concept exists only as a set of criteria within our minds. Even so, these concepts are not universal, which is immediately obvious once you notice the various things people consider fruit even though they fail to meet some criteria, thus showing their non-universality.\n \n This is how abstract concept can \"exist\" in our minds, without having an existence of their own. And these concepts are something we invented. Until you are introduced to one, you don't have knowledge of them. For example, you have no knowledge of the concept of \"hofflenosh\", which is what this thread is all about, but it is still an abstract concept.\n \n As for science and God, you do have a point, but you are also misrepresenting that point. Science is about studying the natural world, if you define it as the world that we can in some way observe, that has some effect on us. While this does mean that science cannot study that which may exist without affecting our reality, it must also be noted that it is not possible to study anything that has absolutely no effect on us by any means, not even logic and philosophy.\n \n Also, while the purely philosophical argument does hold water, making the position of agnosticism theoretically more accurate than either atheism or religion, one must realize the limits of what this argument means.\n \n First, it does not prove the existence of god.\n \n Second, it does not extend very far when it comes to real life. Religion is not just about philosophical debate, it also makes several demands of real life. Observance of rituals, setting up taboos, establishing morality and similar. In order to accapt these, however, one must be able to substantiate them with arguments based upon reality.\n \n Here, we get into different waters. The arguments proposed by the religious often lack a suitable amount of rational support. In the case of those that don't, science can often offer alternative explanations that turn out to be better supported and more likely. In the case of these arguments, atheism is actually a valid position.\n \n And, just in case:\n \"I declare that I know the existence of an entity of a higher order, beyond the ken of mortals, and that this entity demands that we cease existing immediately, for which it offers to reward us with an eternity of blissful nonexistence. If we do not comply, it threatens to utterly destroy us all.\"\n Just to prevent any tricky ideas about there being only one and such...",

Putting your hand in the fire has everything to do with nerves not logic; saying that A then B does not follow because someone could tie your hand (I know people that will burn themselves) in a fire and then A would not equal B, however the laws of logic cannot be violated.\nThe logic is in knowing beforehand that your hand will be burned if stuck into a fire. This has nothing to do with the physical aspects of heat, nerves and burning skin. \n \n \n \nLogic cannot come from experience because people's experiences change and are different which means that the laws of logic could change. Logic does not come from your mother's teaching because not everyone has a mother and mothers think differently. \nPlease introduce me to someone who has no mother.\n \n The deductions regarding experiments in physics involve logic and logical conclusions based upon repeated observations of things happening around us.\n \n To logically conclude that an apple will fall to the ground if released from any given height above the ground has no dependence whatsoever on whether a god made all this matter that we're part of.\n \n \n \n \nAgain, if the laws of logic are human constructs then how can they be absolute since humans think differently and often contradictorily.\nYou mistakenly imply that if a certain group doesn't understand the logic, then the logic is invalid.\n \n \n \n If they are produced from human minds, and human minds are mutually contradictory, then how can the constructs be absolute? Therefore, the laws of logic are not human constructs.\nThis contradicts the fact that logic is an invention born of brain power. If there were no living beings, there would be no logic. There would be plenty to think about but nobody to do any thinking requiring what we know today as logic. Logic is TOTALLY a human construct.\n \n ...and since it has nothing at all to do with the existence of God, atheists are just as good at it as the Bible Thumpers. As a matter of fact, I know an atheist who is far more logical than anyone else I've heard to date.",

   "\"There is no proof that God exists\" is quite accurate. Only the deepest philosophy will come to the point of seriously debating the fault in the statement, which is that as we are posessed of imperfect knowledge we cannot deny the possibility that some as yet undiscovered proof of god might exist. In this case, we'd modify the statement to \"There is no known proof that God exists.\" However, in the context, what you are doing is not deep philosophy, but nitpicking.\n \n As for the laws of logic, once more I shall try to explain from another angle: logic, mathematics and similar are ways in which we describe the universe. Take an apple. Take another apple. Now you have two apples, but you don't actually have two of the same things. You just recognize that apples are similar one to another and that it is reasonable to invent the nonexistent context of an abstract apple.\n\n \n All you have said is there are two apples. I noticed you said \"describe\", I can describe what a chair is, but that description is not the chair itself. Are the apples the \"law of non-contradiction\"?\n \n \nWhile this may be somewhat unclear, it is clarified if you take an apple and a pear. You now have two fruits. However, you will notice that there is no fruit in reality, only apples, pears, peaches and so on. Fruit is an abstract concept. That abstract concept exists only as a set of criteria within our minds. Even so, these concepts are not universal, which is immediately obvious once you notice the various things people consider fruit even though they fail to meet some criteria, thus showing their non-universality.\n\n \n \"Fruit\" is a name we give to identify a physical object; the laws of logic are not physical.\n When you say \"fruit\" exists you can show its existence in the physical world. If the laws of logic exist, then show me. For one thing, atheism cannot account for a universal concept that is not material, and does not depend on our thinking. In addition to that, I am using the same argument atheist's use against the existence of God to get the atheist to show me the existence of the laws of logic. Atheists say, \"Show me God\" I cannot see him. Theist describe that the universe cannot exist without God by showing the affects of God in the material universal (design) Show me the laws of logic, where is it? I cannot see it. Using apples is describing it is not the law itself. Just like I describe the evidence of Gods existence.\n \n The laws or logic are not universal? Again, you are using matter to show something that is non-material, I can look at fruit until I am blue in the face but that only describes concepts, it is not the laws of logic itself. \n \n \nThis is how abstract concept can \"exist\" in our minds, without having an existence of their own.\n\n \n How can they? If they exist in the mind and not on there own, then I can chose not do think about or believe in these laws (Bivalency, Involution, Idempotency,Identity, (Non-)Contradiction, Excluded Middle, Contraction, Commutatively, DeMorgan's, Associatively, Distributivity) and they stop existing? Or I could say, \"hofflenosh\" is a concept I think is stupid and does not exist, come to think of it, the law of excluded middle is a stupid concept so it does not exist either. If is existed only in the mined, it would not be absolute. It would be your opinion of the law of logic existing against someone that says they do not exist. \n \n \nAnd these concepts are something we invented\n\n \n So before \"we invented\" the laws of logic they did not exist?\n Something could be itself and not itself at the same time, before \"we invented\" the law of non-contradiction?\n \n \nUntil you are introduced to one, you don't have knowledge of them. For example, you have no knowledge of the concept of \"hofflenosh\", which is what this thread is all about, but it is still an abstract concept.\n\n \n Just because we do not know the laws of logic does not mean they do not exist. I could debate someone and violate the laws of logic and claim I don't have any knowledge of them and therefore they don't exist for me.\n \n Attacking the person again, not the argument, I guess atheists can make logical fallacies because it's a concept that they can choose to not exist like the concept of \"hofflenosh\"\n \n \nit is not possible to study anything that has absolutely no effect on us by any means, not even logic and philosophy\n\n \n Hmmm, you cannot study the laws of logic. That's like saying we cannot study math because it as no effect on us. Try violating the law of non-contradiction in a test you take. Say to person that is giving the test, \"The wrong answer can be the right answer at the same time sir, because the law of non-contradiction has no effect and does not exist for me, beside its impossible it study the laws of logic or anything abstract like this test.\" \n \n \nAlso, while the purely philosophical argument does hold water, making the position of agnosticism theoretically more accurate than either atheism or religion, one must realize the limits of what this argument means.\n \n First, it does not prove the existence of god.\n \n Second, it does not extend very far when it comes to real life. Religion is not just about philosophical debate, it also makes several demands of real life. Observance of rituals, setting up taboos, establishing morality and similar. In order to accapt these, however, one must be able to substantiate them with arguments based upon reality.\n \n Here, we get into different waters. The arguments proposed by the religious often lack a suitable amount of rational support. In the case of those that don't, science can often offer alternative explanations that turn out to be better supported and more likely. In the case of these arguments, atheism is actually a valid position.\n \n And, just in case:\n \"I declare that I know the existence of an entity of a higher order, beyond the ken of mortals, and that this entity demands that we cease existing immediately, for which it offers to reward us with an eternity of blissful nonexistence. If we do not comply, it threatens to utterly destroy us all.\"\n Just to prevent any tricky ideas about there being only one and such...\n\n \n \n I can see why people would be drawn to atheism, wow, \"eternity of blissful non-existence\" (\"blissful\" you can enjoy non-existence?) as an atheist it does not matter what you do, life has no meaning, we are atoms banging around at random, you live-you die-you stink-and then you're extinct. Do whatever you want, rape, murder, or be the next Hitler. If you want to be kind and caring like Mother Teresa, that's fine too, because there is no difference between Hitler, Stalin, Lenin, Mao and Mother Teresa; in the end, they all have the same consequences for their actions: non-existences.",

That's not a physical king that you can pick up and move on your chess board: it doesn't have the same mass, height, volume, color, or other physical properties as an actual, physical white king. It is a logical representation of a particular chess piece. \n \n Similarly, a white king in our brain is represented by a particular pattern of brain activation: a specific set of neurons fire when we see or recall a white king. There is no actual physical chess piece inside our brain, but rather a logical representation of it. That representation does not have the same mass, height, volume, color, or other physical properties of the actual object it stand in for.\n \n \nabram: When you make a move on a chess game, it is like turning on the lights in room.

   "your example is good about you can not know your name and know your name at the same time. but again, that example is not the law itself. My question is how do you know that statement is true? you seam to gain knowledge my using your senses (touching the pot)what sensing are you using to know that statement. you are now using abstract things like \"names\" to describ the laws of logic because you know you cannot show the laws of logic in the physical universe. So you know something exists thats universial, not apart of, or dependent on the mind of man, non-material, and can not be show in physical world. Atheists dont believe in God because they cannot see him, eventhrough there are physical evidence of a creator but will believe in the laws of logic when it cannot be sean in the physical universe. I can discribe God just like you can give examples of the laws of logic, but the discription of both are not them. that was my first point. my second point was the laws of logic must come from God because universial, unchanging, non-material, absolute concepts (laws of logic) cannot exist when all there is, is matter.\n\n the issue of non-material is probably the only thing that god and logic have in common. however, it is easy for an atheist to believe in logic and apply logic than to belief in god and apply faith.\n \n logic is consistent and reliable. it cant be rigorously tested and conditioned, and still always produce predictable results. take a look at this: 4, 7, 10, 13... the numbers in this sequence follow a pattern. they increase by 3. our sensory perception and our familiarity with addition helps us determine this. if asked for the 5th number in the sequence, you might say 16, but someone that didnt catch the pattern might say something else. since this is subjective, it may vary from person to person depending on their level of math proficiency. now watch this: 3x + 1. this is a formula to the sequence above. however, if asked to calculate the solution when x=5, then there is no sensory perception involved. you simply apply the substitution and get 16. applying this formula does not require perception or subjective perspective. hence it is 100% reliable and predictable\n \n faith, unfortunately, does not work this way. there is nothing reliable and predictable about applying faith. for example, the bible says \"children obey your parents in the lord, so that it may be well with you and you will live long on the earth\". applying this \"formula\" does not produce reliable and predictable results. obedient children sometimes die young, and disobedient rebelious children sometimes grow to old age. not only that, but the clause \"in the lord\" creates a complication, since what is \"in the lord\" as far as parenting goes varies from church to church in various degrees. because no definite corelation between being obedient to your parents \"in the lord\", and long life, can be established, the \"formula\" is inconsistent and unpredictable and is discarded as false.\n \n most faith-based formulae and conditions wind up the same way for the same reasons",

   "I would like to poke my head in here at this late date. I have read most all posts, but please excuse me if I repeat what has already been said. I just want to comment that the premise of this thread simply makes no sense at all and is easily refutable.\n \n \nHow do atheists account for the laws of logic in a universe without God? The Laws of logic are conceptual by nature and absolute.\n\n \n If something is conceptual, that by definition means it was conceived by the human mind. That's what a concept is. I think that simply ends the discussion. Concepts are of human construction and thinking. Logical constructs are absolute only to the extent that they were designed that way.\n \n \n Being absolute they transcend space and time. \n\n \n I don't even know what that means. Kinda woo-woo but has no meaning. \n \n \nThey are not the properties of the physical universe (since they are conceptual) ... \n\n \n I'll give you that, though there is a whole school of debate about what thoughts are. \n \n \n ...or of people (since people contradict each other, which would mean they weren't absolute). So, how do they account for them? \n\n \n Well they are of people and if logic is followed, contradiction does not occur. \n \n \n Examples of logical absolutes are: something cannot be itself and not itself at the same time (Law of non contradiction). A thing is what it is (Law of identity). A statement is either true or false (Law of excluded middle). These are simple, absolute logical absolutes. \n\n \n Blah, blah. So you looked something up. Adds nothing. \n \n \n How can absolute, conceptual, abstract laws be derived from a universe of matter, energy and motion? \n\n \n Stated above.\n \n \nIn other words, how can an atheist with a naturalistic presupposition account for the existence of logical absolutes when logical absolutes are conceptual by nature and not physical, energy, or motion?\n\n \n This whole thing is simply an epistemological argument, for which there is no answer. What is the nature of knowledge? There are positivists (Abe here) and there are constructivists (what Abe says you have to be if you don't believe in god.) This is a metaphysical debate that is decades old and it simply depends upon your point of view for the purpose of the discussion at hand.",

   "I'm so depressed at having missed this one! I don't suppose anyone will mind if I chip in anyway.\n \n Assume God is required to have 'created' logic (along with everything else). Now imagine there is no God. Without him, according to our assumptions, there is certainly nothing - yet our derivation of that certainty presupposes the validity of logic. With no god to create logic, we cannot exclude the possibility of the universe existing. If the universe can exist without god...\n \n :)\n \n Then there's the part about god's 'own nature'. If god cannot violate his own nature, that implies a form of logic to which he is beholden, and which he therefore did not choose. If one form of logic can exist beyond god, so can ours.\n \n :)\n \n What else...\n \n Oh yes: 1+1 = 2, and its binary and unary equivalents 1+1 = 10 and 1+1 = 11. These expressions operate according to the axioms of a mathematical space - axioms we define. They model our perception of reality; they are not in themselves real.\n \n On no level is the equation 1+1 = 2 expressed outside of human consciousness. A rock with another rock next to it is precisely that; they and everything else in the universe represents a single configuration of matter. Before they can be called \"two rocks\" you need an intelligence capable of conceptually partitioning reality and categorising its perceptions. However, the absence of such an intelligence would in no way impede the rocks' (or the universe's) behaviour as a configuration of matter. Ergo, counting is a human invention.\n \n Finally:\n \nthe laws of logic are non-material, universal, unchanging, and absolute\n\n The logic we use to make statements about reality is derived from the way we observe material things behaving, and that logic is not immutable. Quantum physics demonstrates the fundamentally uncertain nature of reality at very tiny scales: the 'law of excluded middle' in particular taking it firmly in the shorts. Given that logic can vary on such a simple metric as physical scale, your argument is starting to look more than a bit frayed at the edges :)",

   "I have some news for you. The laws of logic existed before you came up with them. The laws of logic by defination are outside the meterial universe because they are concepts. The atheistic worldview cannot account for the laws of logic/absolutes becuse only the meterial universe exists.\n But they did not exist before ANYONE came up with them did they. They are as you I think indicated conceptual. And of course the formal logic of say Aristotle is dependent on the law of the excluded middle which forces all logical operations to be two valued only. This law is subject to attack both from a physical direction (namely quantum mechanics) and on the basis of fuzzy set theory (essentialy a logic of continua). So its possible that some or all of the \"laws\" of logic are not valid! Or at least they may not be the only set of internally consistent logical propositions.\n \n Now one might ask why are the \"laws of logic\" so self-evident to most humans. Well that one is fairly simple - those laws reflect the behavior of the physical world we live in. If our brains did not in effect synchronize with that world we would not have survived and reproduced. The world has molded us as it were by evolution to apply the relevant rules to a large degree. The fact that QM is counter-intuitive reflects the fact that our survival and reproduction was NOT dependent on being able to operate within that domain during our evolution. In effect we come out of the box more or less wired for success, but many of our ancestors likely died before we adapted as well as we have. AND we probably are still not maximally adapted.",

   "I just have to add something to this debate.\n \n I'm not sure on this \"the laws of logic existed before man thought them\" thing. Let us suppose that, purely philosophically, there is this \"law of logic\" that exists that we still have not discovered. Just because we have not yet discovered it does not mean that it does not exist. On a side note, who is to say that it has not been discovered by some other creature (but let's not go there). There have been many truths, or laws of logic, that we have discovered as we developed, but this does not mean that we invented them. Much like gravity, it existed long before we thought, \"Oh, so that's what it is.\"\n \n But does all this mean that these laws/concepts/physical properties were created by some superior being?\n \n There was also the argument that because people disagree, then laws of logic cannot be human constructs. This argument does not make sense. Humans are not particularly logical in their thinking, and some humans get things wrong. But this goes no way to either prove or disprove that the \"laws of logic\" are human constructs.\n \n Abram's repeated assumption that atheists do not believe in things that they cannot touch/eat/hump/whatever is complete rubbish.\n \n In fact, the initial assumption behind this whole thread is complete rubbish.\n \n What is more illogical than to say, \"I do not understand this, so it must have been created by something for which I have no evidence\"?\n \n There was another branch a bit further back that brought up the question, \"Can God create a rock so big that he cannot lift it?\"\n \n If God is omnipotent, then the answer would have to be yes. But then, I here you cry, if he can't lift it, then he can't be omnipotent. To which my answer would be, \"Of course he can, but what makes you think that he is constrained by our extremely limited understanding of logic?\"\n \n Maybe there are absolute laws of logic out there, but we are still far too primative to understand them. I don't see how we can be so presumptuous to think that a concept does not exists yet simply because we have not thought of it. I do understand that a concept by definition has to be created by a mind, but as a concept, let's assume that there is a \"truth/concept\" out there that we have not yet thought of, conceptually speaking anyway.\n \n But I also don't see the argument that if we have not yet thought of or understood something that it must have been created by maaaaaaagic.\n \n Smiley",

   "Logic is an act of reason. Laws of logic are necessary for logical reasoning. Take the law of non-contradiction. You don't need a university degree to know that it would be wrong to say it is raining and it is not raining at the same location at the same time. Logic is built into us because we have been created with the ability to reason logically, because we have been created in the image of God, who is the epitome of logical reasoning.\n\n \n \"Laws of logic are necessary for logical reasoning\" is the only part you got right. \n \n Logic is the identification and conceptualization of reality as it exists. The laws of logic are derived from the way reality works. The ability to identify the rules maybe built into us but the logical concepts themselves are not. If humans did not exist then logic wouldn't exist either, but reality itself and all its constituent rules would remain unaffected. \n \n Your argument boils down to that God is the source of all reality and all its rules. Good luck convincing any atheist of that, especially given that there is no evidence. Since reality is the source of everything that exists, asking for the source of reality is like asking who made God. However, our position is stronger here because we have definite evidence that reality exists but there is no evidence that God does. Besides, a self-contradictory, whimsical God would negate the very idea of logic.\n \n \nSpeak to enough people and you will know that logical reasoning is a universal truth accepted by all. Nobody invented it. No cultural group on the planet invented it. \n\n \n That's because reality, on which logic is based, is itself universal. \n \n \nAll the \"evidence and experience of life\" we have tells us that laws of logic are universal, transcendent truths. \n\n \n Transcend what? Reality itself? You will have to give an example of that because I don't think that the concepts of logic would make any sense outside the context of reality. Take Dante's description of God for example and tell me if it makes any logical sense. \n \n \nYour idea that aliens will not experience the same logic we do is unfounded because it is built on the erroneous assertion that environment determines the outworking of logical reasoning.\n\n \n His idea of aliens was probably a bad analogy. Take reality as we know it exists only in this universe, it might exist in a different way, with different rules in another one. Things such as law of non-contradiction might not be applicable there. Since the reality we live in forms our environment, it can be justifiably said that environment does determine the outcome of logical reasoning. \n \n \nHere on planet earth we are one race and we have much in common. But human beings are incredibly diverse. There are so many different culture groups all around us. Yet logic is universal. To suggest that logic is simply a universal and harmonious tool all people groups on the planet somehow created for all of us to make use and sense of is, well, not logical.\n\n \n Like I explained before, logic is the identification and conceptualization of reality and the way it works. When everyone is looking at and trying to understand the same thing then it is not only unsurprising that all would come to the same conclusions, it is expected.",

   "Logic is definitely a man made tool, nothing more.\n\n I disagree. I dont think humans invented logic, we just invented the means of communicating and expressing it, and even that is giving ourselves too much credit. even animals (and aliens, im sure) can appreciate the reality of cause and effect, conditions, specificity and contradictions, and determine if something makessense or can be accepted as true or not based on an internal model of reality that pervades era and environment. thats what logic is, a set of laws that we can depend on to verify what we observe. we didn't invent these laws at all.",
