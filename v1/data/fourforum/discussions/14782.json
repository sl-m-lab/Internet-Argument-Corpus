   "Why is God (the Christian God, the \"uncaused cause\", etc.) so darned obsessed with BLOOD?\n We are told for example that :\n \n * Transgressions must be paid in spilled blood (ours or amazing his can fulfill the necessary unbending requirement).\n \n * Rituals for blood spillage from the uncaused cause can be quite detailed with a specific number of sprinklings on the alter or even upon people or door posts.\n \n * People can be consecrated and enter into a covenant with him via blood sprinklings.\n \n * Women are unclean when they issue blood during a natural course of events. this results in women being unclean for significant part of their lives unfortunately. Even a man can be ritualistic unclean by touching a women when she issues blood.\n \n * Leprosy can be cleaned via some bizarre specifics involving the blood of doves. Something about dipping one dove into the blood of another and sprinkling it about.\n \n * One can enter into commune with God by drinking God's blood metaphorically, literally, or supernaturally (not sure which as christians can't make up their minds on that).\n \n I can understand why humans might be preoccupied with blood - but God? Hmmmmm..... sounds like he's a little too human to haven ot been created by humans.",

It is Men who are obsessive about blood and when they created God they installed their obsession with blood into his character.",
