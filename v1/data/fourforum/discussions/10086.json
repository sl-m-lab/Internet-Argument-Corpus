   "Master shake: In other words, you can't show in any way how this says anything against Darwinism\n \n This contradicts darwinism because darwinism says that each creature is what it is because of the set of genes it happened to be given by its parents. Survival/ability to reproduce, thus, is directly linked to genes. This is the basic foundation of the theory. No thinking or intelligence needed.\n \n But now that you guys have all admitted that animals have intelligence, it contradicts darwinism because now animals have a built-in ability to analyze their situations and respond intelligently. So, for instance, in a darwinian world, a finch who has a mal-adapted beak would perish. In the real, intelligent world, however, a finch with a mal-adapted beak could use its God-given mental rescources to figure out a way to find food by being creative or by outsmarting his otherwise more fit comrads -- making intelligence a great neutralizer in nature.. This shows that physical abilities (ie..genes) are not the whole story when it comes to fitness....and if genes are not the whole story, then the gene-oriented theory has big holes in it....and what's more likelythen, than genes being responsible for fitness is intelligence being responsible for fitness. Thus, if we are going to start ranking the animal kingdom by intelligence, guess who stands at the top???....it sorta makes what the Bible says true: that man is at the top of the totem pole, created in the image of God and able to outsmart and rule over all the animals.",

Does change happen cumulatively by way of copying errors (ala Dawkins) or does it happen by way of mutations in regulatory genes (ala evo devo)? Answer: both. Who was right, Darwin or Lamarck? Answer: both. Does biological change happen randomly or purposefully? Answer: both. What is the object of selection, gene or phenotype? Answer: both. Does selection select from a pool or random variants or nonrandom variants? Answer: both. Does evolution happen mostly because of changing genes or instead by how genes are expressed? Answer: both. Are mutations random or not really random. Answer: both.\n \n So no matter what the issue is, darwinists can have it both or either way depending on their particular need at the time.",
