   "We see yet another example of Bush and his usual rejection of what the citizens of this country want. Bush has vetoed the stem cell research bill, which was passed by Congress, but I am really not suprised.\n \n Here's one article: AOL News - Associated Press\n \n Here is another from ABCNews - it talks about the actual poll of Americans on embryonic stem-cell research ABCNews - Bush Vetoes Stem Cell Research bill\n \n Here are the stats from the poll: \nThe latest ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 68 percent of the American people back stem cell research. \n\n \n I think it is despicable the way Bush totally ignores the will of the people in cases like this.\n \n Here's a quote about this from the CNN article CNN - Bush vetoes bill aimed at promoting stem cell research\n \nDemocrats, focusing on the potential for cures or treatments of Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and other diseases, made the embryonic stem cell legislation a priority when they took control of the House and Senate in January.\n \n \"President Bush won't listen to the more than 500 leading organizations who support the bill including AARP, the American Medical Association and the American Diabetes Association, just to name a few,\" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said.\n \n \"President Bush won't listen to the 80 Nobel laureates or his own director of the National Institutes of Health, who all support embryonic stem cell research. Most importantly, President Bush won't listen to the overwhelming majority of Americans who call out for stem cell research\n.\"\n \n \n \n There is some slightly good news, however: \nReid said he would schedule an override vote \"very, very quickly,\" but not until Wyoming selects a temporary replacement for Republican Sen. Craig Thomas, who died two weeks ago. Democrats do not have enough votes to override Bush's veto.\n \n\n \n I'll be praying that they get enough votes from Republican members to override the veto. It doesn't look too hopeful, but one can always hope.",

Here is what it says: \n \nThe bipartisan coalition that crafted the deal is keeping the still-tentative list under tight wraps as they scramble to fine-tune it with an eye toward attracting the widest possible swath of converts to the bill. The measure, which would grant as many as 12 million illegal immigrants lawful status while tightening border security, stalled on June 7 when just 45 senators voted to end debate and move to a final vote - well short of the 60 whose backing was needed.\n \n \n\n No, it clearly describes them changing it (following the 51%, and it seems probably the 16%). Also, despite your attempts to attack the Democrats, notice the key words here: BIPARTISAN COALITION.\n \n \n There is also a bit of a difference between immigration and stem cell research as well - or did you not see that he it not only ignoring the american public, he is also ignoring over 500 orgnizations and 80 nobel laureates.",

Because they are both needed to research most efficiently. Now some will say why worry about this, whats the rush?
