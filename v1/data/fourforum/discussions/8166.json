   "university noun an institution where students study for a degree, and where academic research is done.\n \n I regard universities as the repository of human knowledge, where the acquisition of knowledge is ongoing and subjected to rigorous attacks and defenses to keep the acquisition of knowledge relatively pure. However, there appears to be differences between the universities of continental Europe, UK universities and U.S. universities. Those knowledgeable about the universities of other parts of the world may wish to broaden the discussion with their knowledge.\n \n The following is commentary on U.S. universities from the Wall Street Journal:\n \n The Confusion on Campus\n By VINCENT J. CANNATO\n May 24, 2006; Page D12\n Are American universities now in their golden age? Many rank as the leading research institutions in the world. A college education is within reach for more Americans than ever before. Applications continue to rise as colleges attract the best and the brightest from the U.S. and from overseas. And yet it is hard not to get the feeling that there is something amiss at American schools.\n \n Recent headlines certainly suggest troubles at individual universities -- Duke with its lacrosse scandal, Yale with its admission of a former Taliban member, Harvard with its routing of president Lawrence Summers. But Harry Lewis, a former dean at Harvard who still teaches computer science there, thinks the problem is deeper than a handful of alarming anecdotes might suggest. In \"Excellence Without a Soul,\" Mr. Lewis decries the \"hollowness of undergraduate education.\"\n \n He takes Harvard as his case study, but many of his conclusions apply to the rest of American higher education. Mr. Lewis finds American universities \"soulless\" and argues that they rarely speak as \"proponents of high ideals for future American leaders.\" He bluntly states that Harvard \"has lost, indeed willingly surrendered, its moral authority to shape the souls of its students....Harvard articulates no ideals of what it means to be a good person.\"\n \n Arguing that American universities are soulless did not originate with Mr. Lewis, of course. In fact, it is one of the main themes of Allan Bloom's classic (and more entertaining) \"The Closing of the American Mind,\" a book to which Mr. Lewis strangely never refers. Still, \"Excellence Without a Soul\" has some fresh arguments and a few pleasantly maverick views. Mr. Lewis defends the benefits of college athletics, for instance: Far from being an overcommercialized distraction, they are a \"source of joy\" and embody an \"ethos of self-sacrifice, perseverance, drive [and] endurance.\" The much-lamented dangers of date rape, he suggests, result in part from a combustible campus mix of alcohol and sexual liberation. Mr. Lewis even includes a game, if unconvincing, defense of grade inflation: Students are better, he says; teaching is better; and more small courses push up grades deservedly \"because students and faculty get to know each other better.\"\n \n The core of this book, though, is a defense of the idea that universities should be about something. What makes an educated person? Unfortunately, too many professors and administrators, if they ever bother to think about it, would have difficulty answering the question beyond the pabulum found in most university brochures.\n \n So how does Harvard define an educated person? A Harvard education, the university states, \"must provide a broad introduction to the knowledge needed in an increasingly global and connected, yet simultaneously diverse and fragmented world.\" Mr. Lewis, rightfully dismissive, notes that the school never actually says what kind of knowledge is \"needed.\" The words are meaningless blather, he says, proving that \"Harvard no longer knows what a good education is.\"\n \n (More)",

   "Such institutional incoherence has consequences. In his sharpest criticism, Mr. Lewis charges that Harvard now ceases to think of itself as an American institution with any obligation to educate students about liberal democratic ideals. As the school increasingly focuses on \"global competency,\" the U.S. is \"rarely mentioned in anything written recently about Harvard's plans for undergraduate education.\" In the absence of agreement on common values or a core curriculum, anything goes. Echoing Allan Bloom's critique of relativism, Mr. Lewis writes that at Harvard \"all knowledge is equally valued as long as a Harvard professor is teaching it.\"\n \n Mr. Lewis skips past many campus matters that seem ripe for discussion (affirmative action, speech codes, the academic monoculture, the viability of the tenure system). He is less an angry prophet than a genteel provocateur. But the portrait he draws, however limited, is disturbing enough.\n \n There is too little accountability at most schools, Mr. Lewis observes. Trustees often abdicate their responsibilities, while college presidents have become glorified fund-raisers. Most professors are \"narrowly educated experts\" with little experience outside academia. They are \"poorly equipped to help college students sort out\" their lives. Meanwhile, professors teach what they want to teach based on their own interests, not on the needs of their students. At too many schools, Mr. Lewis argues, students pursue an \"\u00e0 la carte\" course schedule that lacks coherence and can leave large gaps in knowledge.\n \n There is little incentive, he adds, for reform among the university's various \"constituencies.\" Students want a high grade-point average and a college degree that is a passport to a well-paying job, but they also want freedom from authority. Tenured professors want to be left alone to conduct research without academic oversight. Administrators who prize stability and consensus are loath to rock the boat.\n \n But one \"constituency\" should be concerned. Parents preparing to shell out a small fortune for their children's education will want to read Mr. Lewis's book as they ask themselves: What exactly are we paying for?\n \n Mr. Cannato teaches history at the University of Massachusetts, Boston.",

   "I would guess that there are a few forces at play in what making our current US universities seem more \"soleless\". The first factor seems to be simply the great competition for professional jobs. It seems to be much harder nowadays for graduates to get a good job with a simple liberal arts college degree than it used to a generation or two ago. Therefore, few students allow themselves the luxury of concentrating a large part of their studies on bettering themselves intellectually / morally, and feel the necessity of concentrating nearly all of their efforts on making themselves marketable in the tighter job market. I would think that a second factor comes into play in that some universities might find themselves in a political nightmare if they tried to promote one view of morality vs. another. They often bow to public protest, which has seemed to have the effect of having universities move away from a more traditional, though cohesive approach, to one that is diverse but not cohesive.",

   "I guess that the only morality left is that the Almighty Dollar--or should it be a Yuan now--is God!\n \n So Republican.\n\n I wouldn't say that money is the only thing that drives people but, unfortunately, in the last few decades, the job market in most fields has been such that many people (the non-rich anyway) are forced to consider it. It would be great if people could spend much of their college career in bettering themselves intellectually and morally. Unfortunately, those good times are no longer with us for most people. That doesn't mean that people cannot spend some of their studies in intellectual pursuits or that they cannot spend time after their studies - that is up to their own interests and motivations. \n \n As a Democrat, I would love to see people learn to think for themselves about politics and other issues and universities would be a good place to learn some of those civic skills. However, I recognize that the great majority of students can no longer afford to spend most of their studies in such pursuits without reducing their chances at getting a more responsible and highly paid job. \n \n There are many poorly paid jobs that can be quite interesting and/or noble. However, most people do want the opportunities to own a house, travel, send their kids to college, etc. and such poorly paid jobs make these aspects of life much more difficult.",
