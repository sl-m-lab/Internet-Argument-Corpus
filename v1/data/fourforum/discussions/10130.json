   "ChristianExodus.org is moving thousands of Christians to South Carolina to reestablish constitutionally limited government founded upon Christian principles. It is evident that the U.S. Constitution has been abandoned under our current federal system, and the efforts of Christian activism to restore our Godly republic have proven futile over the past three decades. The time has come for Christian Constitutionalists to protect our liberties in a State like South Carolina by interposing the State's sovereign authority retained under the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n \n The foundations of the United States of America were laid upon these principles, that the rights of man are God-given and inviolate, that the sole purpose of government is to secure these rights, and that the only just powers of government are those specifically delegated by the people. The federal government is restrained by Constitutional Law, the Sovereign States, and the Citizens of those States, each one made in the image of God, with individual rights to life, liberty, and property.\n \n :: ChristianExodus.org :: Come Out of Her, My People\n emoticon_rolleyes \n \n :rolls",

England has an established church, of which the Queen is supreme governor. Wales has no established church, Scotland has a different established church. Ulster doesn't have an established church as far as I'm aware. I don't grant the premise that states with established churches are necessarily undemocratic or less free, Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Norway all have established churches, I wouldn't say they're less free than, say, France or Turkey.",

   "The Establised Church as a political institution;\n CofE bishops get automatic seats in the House of Lords and are entitled to vote on legislation. The Head of State cannot be a Catholic or marry a Catholic.\n There is potential there for problems, though generally the CofE is not confrontational and Bishops tend to be less controversial members of the Lords than for eg. Former flatmates of the former PM, financial donors to political parties, etc. The House of Lords does have juristiction over Scotland, Wales, Ulster etc. so the facvt that those places don't officially have an established church doesn't mean an established church doesn't have power over them.\n \n I find the second point to be, at best anachronistic and potentially divisive.",

   "Anyone want a clever Oxymoron?\n \n Thank GOD for secularism. Because its secularism alone that allows men to seek God, each in their own way. We can let God decide who found him.\n \n Tibet had a nice God running the place. Course, Walt Disney would have been a nice God too. \n \n The real question the Christians have to ask is; Does the interests of the state mirror the interests of their God? Because under a church state the Country will make such claims, in fact they would have too. \n \n We could become the great Quaker state, maybe a puritan state? Lets turn to some Holy Roller state and make the President speak in tongues. It would be a blast to watch Bush screaming out babel. \n \n It would be a great deal of fun to have the congress Publicly prove they have been circumcised. If that would be sinful, we could just have Pat Robertson walk around checking trousers and giving the camera a thumbs up.\n \n We could modify playboy with a Nuns on Parade and have all our women wear head scarves due the the fact that the New Testament is very clear on what women are allowed to wear.\n \n Oh please! lets get back to the old time Religion!
