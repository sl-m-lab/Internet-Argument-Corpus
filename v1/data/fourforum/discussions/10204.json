The firefighter decides to get back at the city for forcing him into a festival of debauchery by suing them for harrassment.\n\n \n \nThe Thomas More Law Center, a conservative Christian legal organization based in Michigan, is helping represent the plaintiffs.\n \n That&#8217;s all you need to know, of course. If it was really sexual harrassment, they&#8217;d have just hired regular lawyers, not a group committed to the fight against the &#8220;homosexual agenda!&#8221;\n \n [Fire department spokesman Maurice] Luque said the agency&#8217;s engines had participated in San Diego&#8217;s LGBT Pride Festival for the past 15 years and never had any complaints.\n \n In 15 years, no complaints, until the fundie brigade was told to drive.\n\n \n 15 years they have firefighters in the parade. emoticon_rolleyes",

They are talking about stereo-types. The average person in the crowd is NOTHING like they cry about.\n These firefighters are the real drama queens here....",

I hadn't gone in years, I'm not that crazy about them but my friend wanted to go. \n There can be some people that act inappropriately. To be honest, they are an embarrassment to me as I do not behave in that way at all. \n They are the minority however. \n \n On a side note though, I bet if everything described were coming from women, they wouldn't be suing, they would be bragging about it for months.",
