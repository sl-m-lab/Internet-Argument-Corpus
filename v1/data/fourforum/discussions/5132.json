   "Would someone care to post the \"Cliff Notes\" of ID theory?\n \n The entire theory seems like a non-sequitor to me, at least as presented by our friendly neighborhood ID peddler.\n \n In essence, it seems as though the central claim is that nothing \"intelligent\" and no \"information\" can be be created except by a creator, and that the world as we know it could not exist without this information. Further to that, the complexity and \"order\" of the universe is evidence of the work of an intelligent designer.\n \n Is that fair enough?\n \n So if nothing intelligent and no information can be created, how did the creator get created? That's step one, IMHO, and it would seem to me it all falls apart right there, but I'm assuming I'll get some kind of an \"always there\" or other such supernatural explanation. A luxury never afforded to the \"scientist\" side of the debate.\n \n As far as \"information\" (I really don't like that word anymore :p ) and complexity are concerned, it comes down to the available scientific explanations vs. \"you're wrong, the creator did it\" in various forms. In other words, it essentially boils down to an entirely philosophical debate as from what I've seen so far, it can't really be argued on a purely scientific level.\n \n Further to that, it would seem to me to be a very tenous position to hold to agree that micro evolution and perhaps speciation can occur, and that the world functions as it does because of \"intelligent design\", and yet profess belief in a 6000 year old earth.\n \n In other words, I can't see ID theory, which seems to me to be essentially a form of theistic evolution, being compatible with Young Earth Creationism, or for that matter, with any form of literal Creationism.\n \n I look forward to being edumacated on the subject.\n \n Waxy",

It is certainly more cerebral than the blatant YEC pseudoscience but on one level at least (God has had and continues to have a direct hand in shaping the universe and all the is within it) it is just the same.\n \n Oh and:\n \n \nThat's actually slightly unfair.
