   "There have been some bold promises made in the history of religions. The boldest I know of is the one Avalokiteshvara made, it goes way beyond the one made by Jesus (which is also pretty bold) and borders on the insane. Yet, as a buddhist, I find Avalokiteshvara's promise easier to understand and actually believe in. \n \n Avalokiteshvara's promise is that anyone who says his name once will be taken by him at the time of death and brought to \"the Holy Paradise in The West\" from which the path to nirvana is straight and one way. \n \n Now, he never said anything about believing in him (or if he's a she, the sex is a little ambigous), just say the name once and you're in the clear. That means that you can say the name now, once, and then forget about it, pray to Jesus or whomever you like, ask for forgiveness that you for one split second prayed to another God, curse that other God the rest of your life... and if, when you die, the promise made to you by Jesus fails for some reason and if the one made by Avalokiteshvara still stands you're safe anyway. \n \n Avalokiteshvara doesn't mind that you hated him the rest of your life, that you prayed to another all that time, he's above that. You said the name once so you're on the list. Pretty long list by now, but you'll be on it. In fact, it's often described this way in its own tradition \"Pray to everyone else first and if they come to help you then that's good. If they don't, call on me and I'll come!\". To me that sounds more like a higher being talking to us than the idea of God demanding that we believe in Him. \n \n I'm not saying this to be stupid or make fun of it, on a deeper level I can accept this idea. If I explained it you'd think it was really silly so maybe I shouldn't, but let's just say that if you accept a worldview where the individual person does not really exist in the ultimate sense, things like these are easier to accept.",

I said that we, as humans, never have to say, or do, for that matter, anything to have our names written in the Book of Life. \n I know very well that no one can enter into Heaven accept he comes to Christ. \n \n I think the big misconception is: When did we get our names written in that book, since there's nothing we can do or say to have it done?

All those unborn children that die due to complications, due to danger to the mother, and those that are deliberately murdered don't have to worry about calling a name, reading the scriptures, etc. They're already slated for Life. Also those that are born, but are so retarded that they know nothing but what their deformed brains allow them to know - which is almost nothing in the normal world - have that promise of Life. All children that die so young that they didn't have the time to seek God and know Him - they also are saved.\n \nI realize we are debating semantics to something that doesn't amount to much more than a fairy tale (and for that, I do feel rather silly I must admit emoticon_xclown ) but enquiring minds want to know.

Since 2001 he is a professor of environmental medicine at the department of bioscience at Karolinska Institutet, one of Europe's largest medical universities and Sweden's main centre for medical training and research. Beside his academic duties, M\u00f6ller is an active member of Evangeliska Fosterlands-Stiftelsen, founded in 1856, a missionary organization within the Church of Sweden. He has edited and authored books on ethics and Gospels exegesis, and recently a volume on Biblical archaeology, The Exodus Case (2000).\n \n This book is the fruit of extensive travels in the Near East and Egypt. Its stated main purpose is to test a hypothesis: that the biblical texts of Genesis 11:27 through Exodus 40:38 are historically correct (pp. 14, 16). A secondary purpose (p. 13) is to evaluate and expand upon the works of the late Ron Wyatt (1933-1999). The work is presented with an explicitly scientific ambition. M\u00f6ller wishes to subject his hypothesis to an unprejudiced test and encourages the reader to be critical but keep an open mind.\n \n So far, so good, it may appear. But there are disturbing signs already in the book's introduction. First, it is na\u00efve to judge these long texts, preserved through thousands of years of oral and textual tradition, as either true or false in their entirety. Academic historians evaluate discrete factual statements, not entire books at one go. But M\u00f6ller emphasizes that he is neither a theologian, a historian nor an archaeologist. In fact, he underlines that he does not know what these disciplines believe regarding the questions he takes on. M\u00f6ller feels that he can thereby offer a fresh perspective.\n \n Then there are the references to Ron Wyatt. If ever there was a true native of D\u00e4niken Land, it was him. Wyatt's writings on Biblical archaeology are such extreme flights of fancy that even many creationist debaters dismiss them as wild imaginings.\n \n\n \n More at link : :p",
