   "1st Amendment Issue. Also, Religious Freedom Restoration Act\n \n Now, instead of banned book lists, we have acceptable book lists. With anything not making that grade being removed from the library. At least, with regard to religious literature for prison inmates in prison libraries. Is the list even necessary, given the traditional role of clerics screening books for prison libraries (for whether or not they incite violence)? What about the content of the list? What about who even puts the list together? Does the list seem biased? Have your favorite religious theologians or texts been excluded? What about the fact that some inmates can get these books anyway if they have the money to send (so that the list restricts only those who don't have the money to buy it elsewhere)? What about the 1st amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act? A Christian and Jewish inmate are taking it to the courts, on that basis, and as a class action. \n \n What do posters think about this? \n \n -------------\n \n Prisons Purge Books on Faith From Libraries \n By LAURIE GOODSTEIN, NY Times\n Published: September 10, 2007\n \n Behind the walls of federal prisons nationwide, chaplains have been quietly carrying out a systematic purge of religious books and materials that were once available to prisoners in chapel libraries. \n \n The chaplains were directed by the Bureau of Prisons to clear the shelves of any books, tapes, CDs and videos that are not on a list of approved resources. In some prisons, the chaplains have recently dismantled libraries that had thousands of texts collected over decades, bought by the prisons, or donated by churches and religious groups. \n \n Some inmates are outraged. Two of them, a Christian and an Orthodox Jew, in a federal prison camp in upstate New York, filed a class-action lawsuit last month claiming the bureau's actions violate their rights to the free exercise of religion as guaranteed by the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. \n \n Prisons Purge Books on Faith From Libraries \n Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Print Single Page Reprints Share\n DiggFacebookNewsvinePermalink\n \n By LAURIE GOODSTEIN\n Published: September 10, 2007\n Behind the walls of federal prisons nationwide, chaplains have been quietly carrying out a systematic purge of religious books and materials that were once available to prisoners in chapel libraries. \n \n Skip to next paragraph \n Multimedia\n Graphic \n Some Excluded Works The chaplains were directed by the Bureau of Prisons to clear the shelves of any books, tapes, CDs and videos that are not on a list of approved resources. In some prisons, the chaplains have recently dismantled libraries that had thousands of texts collected over decades, bought by the prisons, or donated by churches and religious groups. \n \n Some inmates are outraged. Two of them, a Christian and an Orthodox Jew, in a federal prison camp in upstate New York, filed a class-action lawsuit last month claiming the bureau's actions violate their rights to the free exercise of religion as guaranteed by the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. \n \n Traci Billingsley, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Prisons, said the agency was acting in response to a 2004 report by the Office of the Inspector General in the Justice Department. The report recommended steps that prisons should take, in light of the Sept. 11 attacks, to avoid becoming recruiting grounds for militant Islamic and other religious groups. The bureau, an agency of the Justice Department, defended its effort, which it calls the Standardized Chapel Library Project, as a way of barring access to materials that could, in its words, \"discriminate, disparage, advocate violence or radicalize.\" \n \n Ms. Billingsley said, \"We really wanted consistently available information for all religious groups to assure reliable teachings as determined by reliable subject experts.\" \n \n But prison chaplains, and groups that minister to prisoners, say that an administration that put stock in religion-based approaches to social problems has effectively blocked prisoners' access to religious and spiritual materials - all in the name of preventing terrorism. \n \n \"It's swatting a fly with a sledgehammer,\" said Mark Earley, president of Prison Fellowship, a Christian group. \"There's no need to get rid of literally hundreds of thousands of books that are fine simply because you have a problem with an isolated book or piece of literature that presents extremism.\" \n \n The Bureau of Prisons said it relied on experts to produce lists of up to 150 book titles and 150 multimedia resources for each of 20 religions or religious categories - everything from Bahaism to Yoruba. The lists will be expanded in October, and there will be occasional updates, Ms. Billingsley said. Prayer books and other worship materials are not affected by this process. \n \n The lists are broad, but reveal eccentricities and omissions. There are nine titles by C. S. Lewis, for example, and none from the theologians Reinhold Niebuhr, Karl Barth and Cardinal Avery Dulles, and the influential pastor Robert H. Schuller. \n \n The identities of the bureau's experts have not been made public, Ms. Billingsley said, but they include chaplains and scholars in seminaries and at the American Academy of Religion. Academy staff members said their organization had met with prison chaplains in the past but was not consulted on this effort, though it is possible that scholars who are academy members were involved.\n \n The bureau has not provided additional money to prisons to buy the books on the lists, so in some prisons, after the shelves were cleared of books not on the lists, few remained. \n \n A chaplain who has worked more than 15 years in the prison system, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is a bureau employee, said: \"At some of the penitentiaries, guys have been studying and reading for 20 years, and now they are told that this material doesn't meet some kind of criteria. It doesn't make sense to them. They're asking, 'Why are our tapes being taken, why our books being taken?' \"\n \n Of the lists, he said, \"Many of the chaplains I've spoken to say these are not the things they would have picked.\" \n \n The effort is unnecessary, the chaplain said, because chaplains routinely reject any materials that incite violence or disparage, and donated materials already had to be approved by prison officials. Prisoners can buy religious books, he added, but few have much money to spend. \n \n Religious groups that work with prisoners have privately been writing letters about their concerns to bureau officials. Would it not be simpler, they asked the bureau, to produce a list of forbidden titles? But the bureau did that last year, when it instructed the prisons to remove all materials by nine publishers - some Muslim, some Christian.\n \n The plan to standardize the libraries first became public in May when several inmates, including a Muslim convert, at the Federal Prison Camp in Otisville, N.Y., about 75 miles northwest of Manhattan, filed a lawsuit acting as their own lawyers. Later, lawyers at the New York firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison took on the case pro bono. They refiled it on Aug. 21 in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York. \n \n \"Otisville had a very extensive library of Jewish religious books, many of them donated,\" said David Zwiebel, executive vice president for government and public affairs for Agudath Israel of America, an Orthodox Jewish group. \"It was decimated. Three-quarters of the Jewish books were taken off the shelves.\" \n \n Mr. Zwiebel asked, \"Since when does the government, even with the assistance of chaplains, decide which are the most basic books in terms of religious study and practice?\"\n \n The lawsuit raises serious First Amendment concerns, said Douglas Laycock, a professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, but he added that it was not a slam-dunk case.\n \n \"Government does have a legitimate interest to screen out things that tend to incite violence in prisons,\" Mr. Laycock said. \"But once they say, 'We're going to pick 150 good books for your religion, and that's all you get,' the criteria has become more than just inciting violence. They're picking out what is accessible religious teaching for prisoners, and the government can't do that without a compelling justification. Here the justification is, the government is too busy to look at all the books, so they're going to make their own preferred list to save a little time, a little money.\" \n \n The lists have not been made public by the bureau, but were made available to The Times by a critic of the bureau's project. In some cases, the lists belie their authors' preferences. For example, more than 80 of the 120 titles on the list for Judaism are from the same Orthodox publishing house. A Catholic scholar and an evangelical Christian scholar who looked over some of the lists were baffled at the selections. \n \n Timothy Larsen, who holds the Carolyn and Fred McManis Chair of Christian Thought at Wheaton College, an evangelical school, looked over lists for \"Other Christian\" and \"General Spirituality.\" \n \n \"There are some well-chosen things in here,\" Professor Larsen said. \"I'm particularly glad that Dietrich Bonhoeffer is there. If I was in prison I would want to read Dietrich Bonhoeffer.\" But he continued, \"There's a lot about it that's weird.\" The lists \"show a bias toward evangelical popularism and Calvinism,\" he said, and lacked materials from early church fathers, liberal theologians and major Protestant denominations. \n \n The Rev. Richard P. McBrien, professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame (who edited \"The HarperCollins Encyclopedia of Catholicism,\" which did make the list), said the Catholic list had some glaring omissions, few spiritual classics and many authors he had never heard of. \n \n \"I would be completely sympathetic with Catholic chaplains in federal prisons if they're complaining that this list is inhibiting,\" he said, \"because I know they have useful books that are not on this list.\"\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/10/us/10prison.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin",

   "I have mixed views on this subject. I can understand the motivations behind the move to ban certain books that may support or advocate terrorist action or extreme hatred of the West. It seems that the prisons are trying to be inclusive of a wide range of religions and are trying to make their acceptable books list as large as they can, but I believe that their very approach hampers them. It is an enormous undertaking to read and analyze thousands of books currently available to prisoners, so any \"acceptable books\" list would be automatically limited.\n \n Instead, I would support a different approach. Namely, keep all books legal except for ones that are specifically found to be dangerous. One would not have to analyze all books, just the ones that seem to be loaned out by a reasonable number of prisoners, as well as new books that are requested - thus reducing the list of books that would have to be analyzed. It is a question of balance: balancing security needs after 9/11 with limitations of bureaucracy with the freedom of information for prisoners (where prisoners by definition do not have all the same rights as the rest of us during their incarceration).",

   "I don't support censorship either (with same exceptions - e.g. child pornography), though I think the prison has a legitimate interest in filtering some material that explicitly \"incites violence\" (a kind of vague criteria). In this case, however, according to the article the prison did have a system previously -- chaplans reviewed any material for such issues. And now, in addition to limiting reading to a list, the list appears rather slanted in favor of only a few theological approaches. AND there's no explanation as to why so many books were gotten rid of -- what possible connection they could have to \"inciting violence\"? Plus, the committee membership is anonymous and has been completely unaccountable. \n \n I can't think of anything better for inmates to do than read, get an education, and improve themselves. And isn't religion supposed to be about improving oneself? So why a prison would want to deprive inmates of religious literature by thousands of books is beyond me. The religious books that explicitly \"incite violence,\" I'd think, are few and far between. Unless one wants to start ditching holy bibles because of Leviticus. \n Does Leviticus incite violence?

   "Here, they are not talking about people in general but only prisoners. Prisoners are generally there because they have violent tendencies to begin with and because they have performed some gross violation of the law - meaning that they cannot be trusted with the same freedoms we all have. I think that prisoners should be treated humanely, but I would not give them the same rights as we all have. Part of their punishment is to lose some of those rights (not only the freedom of movement but other rights as well) during the period of their incarceration and, in a more limited extent, parole. \n \n Though I would only limit prisoners rights where necessary, I would agree that certain books supporting violence should be banned from prison libraries. Besides being capable of influencing violent behavior in prisoners to begin with, there is also the consideration that social pressures are generally much stronger in prisons than in the outside world - where one can generally escape ones antagonizers. A vulnerable prisoner might therefore feel that he has no choice other than being recruited to a local violent group, unless he is willing to be victimized. Taking away the useful reading material for recruitment would make it harder to truly convince that prisoner.\n \n Anyway, those are just a few thoughts on the matter. The bottom line is that I differentiate between freedoms of responsible people who have not committed major crimes and prisoners who have lost some of those rights because of their actions and untrustworthiness.",

   "As jitobear stated, censorship is a serious thing. It is especially bothersome to me when the censorship involves religion. If any issue at all is protected by our amended Constitution it is the right to publish and read any religious materials whatsoever. The government cannot force or prohibit the observance of religious thought, be it by censorship or other means.\n \n Then the question to me becomes one of offering constitutional rights to prisoners. Do they deserve them? Of course they do. That is their main protection against inhumane and illegal treatment.\n \n I am curious as to the reasoning behind this proposed censorship. I did not connect the opening post to any specific reasoning. Has it been shown that religious literature is harmful or dangerous to prisoners' health and well being, or dangerous to the guards, or dangerous to society in general.\n \n What is the main purpose of the ban? The only glint I got was about midway through the OP where the supposed reason is (all in the name of) \"prevention of terrorism\". Has anyone determined that terrorism is aided by the presense of religious literature in prisons? Are the powers that be going to deny all manner of religious literature just to keep radical Muslim literature out of our prisoner's minds? (That's what comes to mind when I think of terrorism.)\n \n If that be the case, then why not extend the censorship to areas outside the prison walls? Could it be that this would be IMPOSSIBLE? The only permitting factor in the prison picture is the fact that it can be easily done and someone wants to do it.\n \n I say let prisoners read what they will from the same global library we have. Any published print that is suitable for the general public should be offered in prisons.\n \n I will qualify my statement to say that known terrorists should have no rights at all, including the right to communicate with the outside world in any manner whatsoever.

   "JoB,\n \n I note with interest that no one has seen fit to actually provide an answer to your question.emoticon_xagree\n\n \n Ok, WHY IS RAPING A CHILD WORSE THAN RAPING AN ADULT?\n \n 1. An adult has more maturity and can overcome trauma better than a kid.\n 2. Who'd what their First Time to be RAPE? That's gonna set a great example for healthy sexuality for the rest of their lives.\n 3. It physically hurts more.\n 4. A child is innocent and can't fend for themselves. They are developing and don't understand the world. A rape in the early years is MUCH more likely to cause a life to go off track. (drugs, promiscuity, mental health disorders, suicide, etc...)\n 5. It is horrible to assault anyone, sexually or otherwise. However, there are degrees of assault. Smacking your boyfriend isn't as bad as stabbing him. As a society we've determined that certain crimes are worse than others and we've determined that crimes against children are particularly heinous. Might not be in your world, but in the real world it is!",
