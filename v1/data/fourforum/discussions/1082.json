Slavery in the new United States of America would last another 89 years until the end of the Civil War. But even then, the equality promised in the Declaration of Independence was denied not only to African Americans, but also to other minorities and women. Even today, Americans are still not certain what equality means in such areas as affirmative action, sex discrimination, and gay rights.\"\n http://www.crf-usa.org/Foundation_docs/Foundation_lesson_declaration.htm\n \n RevHellBound, as you support Natural Rights, you must also support the rights of homosexuals in freedom of expression, and for the right for people to have an abortion, and for gay marriages. I would dearly like to see the NRA step forward into the debate in support of homosexual rights.\n \n Anyway, I asked of you 'what are natural rights?' I have been doing some research into these un-Christian ideals.*\n \n \"Natural rights are those which appertain to man in right of his existence. Of this kind are all the intellectual rights, or rights of the mind, and also all those rights of acting as an individual for his own comfort and happiness, which are not injurious to the natural rights of others.\" --Thomas Paine, Rights of Man, 1791.\n \n \"Man [is] a rational animal, endowed by nature with rights.\" --Thomas Jefferson to W. Johnson, 1823\n \n \"Under the law of nature, all men are born free.\" --Thomas Jefferson: Legal Argument, 1770.\n \n But, are there limits on these rights? Are they truly inalienable?\n \n Jefferson was particularly a keen follower of John Locke, who had proposed that the natural state of man was Life, Liberty and Property.\n Natural Rights reflect the zeit geist of the humanism of the Enlightenment \"Jefferson did not invent the ideas that he used to justify the American Revolution. He himself said that he had adopted the \"harmonizing sentiments of the day.\" These ideas were, so to speak, \"in the air\" at the time.\"**\n http://www.crf-usa.org/Foundation_docs/Foundation_lesson_declaration.htm\n \n However, for Locke, these rights did not apply to blacks.\n \"CX: Every freeman of Carolina shall have absolute power and authority over his Negro slaves, of what opinion or religion soever.\"\n (http://users.cyberone.com.au/myers/locke.html) So wrote John Locke who helped draft the \"Fundamental Constitutions for the Government of Carolina\" in 1669\n \n But like many people of the enlightenment, 'natural rights' never extended to women, and black people. \"In Black Odyssey, Nathan Huggins condemns the American Framers for establishing, not freedom, but \"a model totalitarian society.\" Huggins condemns the Framers for refusing to mention the words \"slave\" or \"slavery\" in the Constitution in an effort to \"sanitize their new creation\" and avoid \"the deforming mirror of truth.\" The Founding, he concludes, was simply \"a bad way to start.\" \n http://www.policyreview.org/fall95/thdso.html\n \n Therefore these 'natural rights' are not universal, at least not in the minds of the people who framed the US Constitution. And, did people really want the absolute freedom for the individuals? \"Probably none of the political delusions which have sprung from the \"natural rights\" doctrine has been more mischievous than the assertion that all men have a natural right to freedom, and that those who willingly submit to any restriction of this freedom, beyond the point determined by the deductions of a priori philosophers, deserve the title of slave.\"\n http://www.mathcs.clarku.edu/huxley/CE1/NatR.html\n \n What do gun-owners think?\n Were the 'inalienable rights as proscribed by the constitution as how you believe them to be now? Where are your slaves? Wasn't that a mighty act of the US government to interfere in the private affairs of hard-working white people? Do you denounce the US Civil War?\n \n \n \n *I say un-Christian because for the most part, those in favour of 'natural rights' declare that they are simply derived from nature (not God), or a theistic model of an uncaring creator.\n \n **Further influences come from David Hume who wrote...\n \"In many nations, the female sex are reduced to like slavery, and rendered incapable of all property, in opposition to their lordly masters. But though the males, when united, have in all countries bodily force sufficient to maintain this severe tyranny, yet such are the insinuation, address, and charms of their fair companions, that women are commonly able to break the confederacy, and share with the other sex in all the rights and privileges of society. [Hume, 1751: sec. III, part 1]\"\n Here Hume defends the de facto oppression of women by men on the grounds that women manage to find ways of mitigating their disadvantage to lead fulfilling lives and influence society. In the sentences prior to these, Hume had denied the natural equality of all humans on the evidence of their vastly different levels of civility, while at the same time regretting that European colonists have slaughtered native Americans and impressed Blacks into slavery.\n http://inpress.lib.uiowa.edu/poroi/vol2001/fuller2001.html\n \n \n PS I went to the NRA web-site and did a search on the word 'homosexual'.

   "\"The natural-rights view of the Founders would preclude this. According to it, the very same \"laws of nature and of nature's God\" that allow us to recognize that all human beings are born equal with regard to natural rights, also allow us to see that human beings are born male and female for the purpose of procreation and child-rearing. Therefore, although laws that would deny homosexuals the natural rights to acquire property, vote, speak freely, etc., would be irrational and wrong, laws that prohibit homosexuals from marrying and adopting children are rational and just.\"\n http://www.claremont.org/writings/981105arnn.html\n \n RevHellBound;\n \n You claimed that the US Constitution not so much as delineates rights as protects them; many not proscribed.\n \n You appeal to largely ethereal concepts such as 'natural rights' in order to back up you claim to owning guns. A 'God given right' perhaps.\n \n Rather than just look at this as some kind of deistic obsession of yours; without any real form or definition (as you've failed to explain your ideas of 'natural rights'), I decided to research these natural rights to see what exactly they are.\n \n The founders of your country based their beliefs on ideas such as those stemming from Hume and Locke.\n \n Both Hume and Locke believed in limited rights - to all free white protestant men.\n \n Sigillary the founders of your country did likewise; they allowed slavery, and literally stated that all men are created equal.\n \n Today most people who support these 'natural rights' argue for a small government - or little government interference in personal issues. But do these people really apply these rights universally? No, because most are right-wing religious people who don't support gay marriages! So, most people today in the US don't believe in any universal or absolute rights even in issues of personal choice or morality! You seem to be an exception by supporting gay rights. Congrats!\n \n To make it simple; you're appealing to an idea. No one who formed the tenets of the idea really believed in applying these rights to all individuals (excusing people who were black, Catholic, women, without property). Further, the framers of your Constitution and laws did not perceive of 'natural rights' as you do. Still, most Americans today also don't believe in 'natural rights' when applied to homosexuals! You really seem to be in a minority on this... maybe you've misunderstood 'natural rights' altogether! So for you to start spouting this and trying to apply it to your wish to carry a gun, is an appeal to jingoistic nonsense.\n \n Though you said \"I have a problem with any \"group\" screaming for their groups \"rights\".\" I take it to mean you've no problem with the NRA doing the same.*\n \n So, from the beginning, no one believed in any 'universal' rights at all.\n \n So where then do you base your opinion that these rights are universal to all men?\n \n \"Some gays and lesbians have gone further and demand laws banning discrimination in private employment. But the owners of private property also have natural rights. The basic natural law of property is \"to the creator belongs the creation.\" A person has a natural right to his or her own labor and the creations of one's labor, including goods one has exchanged. The owner of an enterprise has a moral right to do with his produced property what his pleases so long as it is peaceful and honest.\"\n http://www.progress.org/archive/fold151.htm \n So, by 'natural rights' homosexuals can be discriminated against, on the basis of their sexual preference!\n \n Why, in fact RevHellBound do you pay taxes? Can you be compelled to? What right has a government to infringe upon the full enjoyment of your hard earned money?\n \n \n \n \n *The fact that you found one web-site that the NRA has set up as a front does not prove anything.\n \n For the record I don't support homosexuality. My Church doesn't agree with it, and I don't. I am being consistent. However most of the people who are in the NRA seem to be hypocrites for at one hand they are proclaiming universal natural rights, and on the other denying these same rights to one group of people based on their sexual preference. I hate hypocrites, RevHellBound.\n \n \"Rights give rise to obligations between all men, including those who are in power.

Ah but for the selective memory of the hypocrite.*\n \n The same one who backed Kelvin making wild statements about the crime rate in Australia, and then turned around and said I had no right to comment on the USA!**\n \n If you want genuine debate, fine. I've still yet to hear any definition from you of 'what a natural right is' despite several attempts, and why this right of yours as interpreted by you may be different from the interpretation of the founding fathers, who believed such rights only existed to propertied Protestant men.\n \n Why have successive court cases shown that their interpretation of Amendment 2 to mean the defence of rights against outside or internal enemies; NOT personal defence! (thus carrying a concealed knife is illegal).\n \n The choice is yours...\n \n address issues\n \n or\n \n name call\n \n I'm just as happy to do either..\n \n \n \n *Post 2 you said \"also you XXXXX\"\n \n \n **Post 2 \"This post has nothing to do with gun control. I won't continue to address your ignorance of this post. Perhaps we should start talking about you aussies in e. timor? or perhaps I should get all involved in Austrailias (sic) treatment of ITS natives, Or perhaps we should talk about the Aussies RACIST immigration policies or the number of violent crimes against gays???? \"\n The argument here being I have no right to comment because of ills conducted by Australia... however, you've not picked up on a small point, I've conceded in numerous posts the wrongs Australia has done. Only you've been dishonest not to\n a) acknowledge that I've done so\n and\n b) acknowledge that I have a right to comment on international fora",
