The state pays roughly 20% of the costs, with the rest being made up through charitable contributions and out of the coffers of the catholic church.\n \n that is why this is an issue. The ability to arrange adoptions and house orphans is reallynot somethign that is a privelage granted by the state. It is a charitable act that is being carried out at great expense to the catholic church and ultimately the churches members. \n \n The church is not going to fight too hard to retain the ability to take care of orphans.

That includes costs of building new facilities.\n \n If the state really wants to do that, they are welcome, though frankly, given the economic state of massachusetts, it would be an absolutly stupid decision. In the meantime, all the kids that would have been adopted out by the catholic church will remain in the system until the state can get their act together and get some kind of program in place. \n \n This is the problem with allowing charitable organizations to operate at all.

The people doing the charitable work, the people raising the charitable dollars, the people placing the kids are all in favor of adoption by same-sex couples.\n \n Secondly, Catholic Charities is NOT part of the hierarchy of the Church. It is a separate legal entity and raises ALL its money from the community, Catholic and non-Catholic. Not a penny comes from Church coffers. The only connection is that the Archbishop is the Chairman of its Board. Of course there are traditional connections and many of the supporters of the charity are devout Catholics, but they don't support the Archbishop's interference in existing policy.\n \n Lastly, if the group is really spending the amounts you're talking about, maybe someone else SHOULD do it. They've managed to place 700-some kids in 20 years. At 60 million a year, that's awfully inefficient.\n \n It's possible that by conflating the adoption group and the orphanages, you've managed to come up with your analysis.

BUT, if the state wants them to continue doing that work, they are going to have to exempt them, or, more likely, turn a blind eye when they disobey the law. The worchester branch of catholic Charities has already \"solved\" the problem. When a gay couple applies, they simply refer them to another adoption source. \n \n What has happened in other states where this has been an issue is that catholic charities simply tosses applications from gay couples in the trash. Realistically, they could have odne that in Massachusetts with no problem and the state would probably never know.\n \n \n \nIf the church can't follow the law while doing their charity work than yes, the state should take it over. It would be a shame if that was necessary, but the law must be followed. Personally, I would rather pay higher taxes than see the citizens of my state discriminated against. Or, alternatively, Massachusetts could find a charitable organization to take over that doesn't have a problem with following the law.\n\n \n There are already multiple for profit or small charitable organizations in Mass performing the same service. None of them can step up with the startup costs and yearly cash requirements to replace the catholics in this arena IMO, the catholics should simply close down shop. If the people of the commonweath of massachusetts prefer to pay the higher taxes (and we are talking a 20% increase), let them. \n \n \nHow is adoption not a secular activity? Are you trying to say that if a church does anything it's automatically religious, and exempt from normal laws? IANAL, but I'm pretty sure that's not the case.\n\n \n No, I am saying that religous charity is not a secular activity, regardless of what that charity entails. The catholics run a clinic in Kansas City and they refuse to treat homosexuals with STDs. They also refuse to give out prescriptions for birth control or referrals for abortions. When somebody else is footing the bill for something, you loose most of your power to impose conditions on them, if you wish for them to continure footing the bill. That is the real issue here. Massachusetts wants the catholics to continue to foot the lions share ff the bill for their adoption programs, BUT they want to impose conditions. That is not the way the real world works. They were discussing this earlier on MSNBC and they had a guy from the massachusses legislator there. He was sayign that mass could not afford to pick up the slack if the catholics pulled out. His solution? Draft legislation FORCING the catholics to continue offering their services.\n \n \nAgain, I'm pretty sure that's not the case. If it were all a rich person would need to do is start a \"charitable foundation\", donate a chunk of money to it, and then have that foundation act outside the law. Being religious, or rich, or both, doesn't mean you get to act any way you like. The law applies equally to everyone.\n\n \n You are more than welcome to pass laws forcing charitable organizations hands. In the past, this has not been effective. They simply close up shop. Charitable organizations in this country net out nearly a trillion $ in aid each year, and over 80% of them are religously oriented. As long as there are poor people, we need those religous organizations to take care of them becuase frankly the government has shown that it is incapable of doing so. \n \n I think that you will find that if this ever hits the courts, you are incorrect. In 19 states religous charities have been exempted from various civil rights laws regarding discrimination (primarly havign to do with homosexuality). 2 federal courts have also ruled that, as private organizations, it is permissible for charities to refuse service to certain people or certain groups. \n \n You might look for legal opinions on this. Essentially, the state of mass does not have a leg to stand on here. It is important to note that the services the catholic church provides does not include the paperowrk, which is the legal part of the adoption. What catholic charities does is set up screenings and interviews between prospective adoptive parents and people with kids to adopt out. They also take custday of children whose parents want them to do closed adoptions. \n \n Strangley enough, it is the supreme courts decision in Dale Vs Boy Scouts of America that cuts the argument out from under mass. The supreme court ruled that a private organization has the right to discriminate, even if they are publicly funded, or partially publicly funded, or if they perform public services. In fact, the federal education act witholds funds from schools that refuse to allow groups, specifically the boy scouts and military recruiters, from using their facilities based on an anti homosexual bias. \n \n These arwe the services in quesiton here. The paperwork is not even done by the church, it is done by a state appointed social worker. Most of the legal opinions I have seen on this put the catholics refusal to deal with gay clients under the heading of \"right of association\" conveyed in the Dale case.\n \n In the end, it is probably a moot point. In all practicality, the catholics will probably od what they do in other states. Take applcations from gays and circle file them, and never say anything about it. The state will ignroe it, knowing damn well they don't have a legal leg to stand on and that they cannot afford to pick up the slack if the catholics walk away.",

   "First of all, the Church hierarchy is the party that has suddenly developed a problem with adoptions by gay couples. The people doing the charitable work, the people raising the charitable dollars, the people placing the kids are all in favor of adoption by same-sex couples.\n \n Secondly, Catholic Charities is NOT part of the hierarchy of the Church. It is a separate legal entity and raises ALL its money from the community, Catholic and non-Catholic. Not a penny comes from Church coffers. The only connection is that the Archbishop is the Chairman of its Board. Of course there are traditional connections and many of the supporters of the charity are devout Catholics, but they don't support the Archbishop's interference in existing policy.\n\n \n And it will not matter one iota. You need to step back and look at reality here. The church maintains 100% contorl over catholic charities.

   "http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2006/03/14/romneys_retreat/\n \n Excerpt: \nThe underlying problem is clear. The Vatican believes homosexual acts are ''intrinsically disordered.\" Massachusetts Catholic bishops, as a result, have prohibited Catholic Charities from allowing same-sex couples to adopt children the charity wants to place. But state law prohibits discrimination, including that against homosexuals. Since the automatic rejection of same-sex couples would obviously be discriminatory, Catholic Charities has decided to abandon its founding mission of facilitating adoptions, one that it has carried out to the great benefit of the public for over a century.\n \n Romney said yesterday he would seek to exempt Catholic Charities from the law because its members ''should be able to follow the practices of their religion.\" But why, on a matter of public policy, should a religion's practices trump the state's? What if a well-meaning group wanted to discriminate against blacks, or against a religious group such as the Catholic Church? Would Romney file a bill to protect that bias?\n \n Romney is governor, not a Catholic bishop. And he is considering a run for president, not pope. He should be defending the law, not proposing loopholes of discrimination.\n \n A first step would be for Romney to ask Catholic bishops to reconsider whether the Church's own strong position on caring for vulnerable children deserves as much weight as its opposition to homosexuality.\n \n Second, Romney and others could explore whether there is some way to create an arm's-length organization that would handle adoptions with same-sex couples in close association with Catholic Charities, but with enough distance from it to avoid a Church veto.\n \n Failing those, perhaps a new group could be formed outside the Church to take over Catholic Charities adoption work. Perhaps many of the dedicated people performing that work so skillfully for Catholic Charities now would move to the new organization. Perhaps the public would fund it enthusiastically. Perhaps it could even be called catholic charities, with a small ''c,\" restoring the root meaning of the word as ''general, universal, or inclusive in human affairs.\"\n \n Even respecting the Catholic Church's right to its beliefs on Church matters, its position on same-sex parenting is discrimination when applied to public matters.\n",
