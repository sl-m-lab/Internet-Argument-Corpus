Go in, get saddam, and install a puppet government who will be our little lap dogs and let us put up bases all over the place. \n \n Unfortunatly, we underestimated the resistancwe of the Iraqi people (we have managed to do what saddam never did, unite the shia and the sunnis against a common enemy) and overestimated the combat effectiveness of our individual soldiers. We found (many military experts have been saying this for years, so it shouldn't be a great surprise) that while we definatly have the best military in the world, when you take away all the gadgets and gizmos and you are down to a guy int he street with a gun, our soldiers are poorly trained to handle themselves. Now we have been drawn into fighting an urban guerilla war, where those gadgets are of limited or no value, and we are pretty much reduced to men in the streets with guns.",

We went there on a mission to find WMDs and to kill and replace Saddam.\n \n Now that WMDs were not found you guys think Bush is trying to cover something up. He is not. He is simply trying to execute the second half of his plan. If you remember correctly, we had a two fold plan. Find WMDs and overthrow Saddam.

Saddam disobeyed 18 UN resolutions, the cease fire treaty he signed after GW1 and the no fly zones, and you want to give him the benefit of the doubt because we \"dehumanized\" him. \n\n \n The problem with this whole rant is that you are wrong. We had the evidence that he destroyed his WMD's following GW1, and we said \"he's lying\". We sent inspectors to Iraq, who came back and said \"couldn't find any\" and we said \"look again\".\n \n either my previous assesment is correct, or we have to move on to option # 2, which is that the world is full of XXXXXX, and anybody who believed that Saddam had WMD's is one of them. \n \n Even when he violated the no fly zones, we gave him the green light (he was bombing terrorist training camps). Clinton explained that \"he has the right ot keep order in his own coutnry\". Now we see how difficult we can be.\n \n From a practical standpoint, we invaded in gulf I and drove the Iraqi army back inot Iraq. We put a bunch of unreasonable restrictions on them mostly in the name of protecting israel (or at least holding israels places as the regional superpower). \n \n Most of the UN resolutions he was in violation of were regarding WMD's, whcih he kept claiming not to have and we kept disbelieving. Now, since we know he didn;t have them, was he really in violation, or were we simply wrong in finding him in violation?\n \n \n \nNext thing you know he will be out on parole w/time served.\n\n \n Of course not. I say we give him back his country with our humbelest apologies and let him put his house back in order. In addition to getting us out of the mess we have found ourselves in, it is likely that anti US terror would see a huge slump in recruitment. Yes, he tortured people and killed those who disagreed with him. Now, we have taken over, and apparently torture people and kill those who idsagree with us. I think that Americans should take a lesson from this. Saddam was doing a better jop of keeping order in Iraq than we are. Let him do it. \n \n The ME is unlike anywhere on the planet. The people are unli8kely to wish to throw off thousands of years of culture and tradition as far as how they live and their governmental preferences in favor of western values. Tghis may be difficult for Americans to understand, since ofr all intents and purposes we are a nation without a history (we haven't even been around for 300 years, by contrast, the Arabs have social and cultural traditions going back thousands of years). In addition to being entirely incapable of comprehending the impact of traditions which are thousands of years old, Americans als tend to be rather conceited people. We have it stuck in our heads that everybody wants to be just like us. his simply isn't the case. Most of the world hates Americans. We are considered arrogant, ignorant, small minded crybabies who expect instant gratification of our every desire. \n \n Do you have a better explanation for why, despite the evidence given by our own inspectors, our leaders continued to argue for the existance of WMD's in Iraq (pre war that is)?",
