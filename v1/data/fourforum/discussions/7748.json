   "According to recent statements of European Commissioner for Foreign Affairs and EU Neighbourhood Policy, Benita Ferrero-Wandner, a tactile part of EU energy sphere of cooperation is assigned to my native Azerbaijan. Mrs. Ferrero-Wandner has stressed that in 2006 EU is going to accelerate cooperation with our country. And she hopes that Azerbaijan will also take solid advantages of EU market. \n I fully agree with her here. But it is not deniable that the process of our integration with Europe won't be too easy and quick, as Mrs. Ferrero-Wandner tries to present here. \n The matter is that such parasitic countries as Georgia and Ukraine stand in our way of wider energy cooperation with Europe. They profit by their transit location in order to blackmail both Europe and our country. They constantly intimidate Europe by price advance on energy sources. In regard to Azerbaijan they try to bulldoze it by fulfillment of GUAM treaty obligations. \n In this case it will be better for our country to withdraw from this treaty. And it would be proper for Europe to support us here.",
