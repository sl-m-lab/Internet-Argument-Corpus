   "Sheol is only the grave. \n\n \n 20 reasons why sheol is not (necessarily) the grave:\n \n Even if the word sheol did refer to a literal grave so what! The word \"spirit\" sometimes refers to literal wind or breath, but most time the word is used, it cannot refer to wind or breath. So too, the vast majority of uses of Sheol/Hades cannot refer to the grave.\n \n (Death and The Afterlife, Robert Morey, p. 76,77)\n \n While the kabar (to bury) is used in connection with kever it is never used in connection with Sheol. \n \n We can bury someone in a grave but we cannot bury anyone in Sheol (Gen. 23:4, 6, 9,19, 20; 49:30, 31, etc.). \n \n While kever is found in its plural form \"graves\" (Ex. 14:11), the word Sheol is never pluralized.\n \n While a grave is located at a specific site (Ex. 14:11), Sheol is never localized, because it is everywhere accessible at death no matter where the death takes place. No grave is necessary in order to go to Sheol.\n \n While we can purchase or sell a grave (Gen. 23:4-20), Scripture never speaks of Sheol being purchased or sold.\n \n While we can own a grave as personal property (Gen. 23:4-20), nowhere in scripture is Sheol owned by man.\n \n While we can discriminate between graves and pick the \"choicest site\" (Gen. 23:6), nowhere in Scripture is a \"choice\" Sheol pitted against a \"poor\" Sheol. \n \n While we can drop a dead body into a grave (Gen. 50:13), no one can drop anyone into Sheol.\n \n While we can erect a monument over a grave (Gen. 35:20), Sheol is never spoken of as having monuments. \n \n While we can, with ease, open or close a grave (2 Kings 23:16), Sheol is never opened or closed by man.\n \n While we can touch a grave (Num. 19:18), no one is ever said in Scripture to touch Sheol.\n \n While touching a grave brings ceremonial defilement (Num. 19:16), the Scriptures never speak of anyone being defiled by Sheol.\n \n While we can enter and leave a tomb or grave (2 Kings 23:16), no one is ever said to enter and then leave Sheol.\n \n While we can choose the site of our own grave (Gen. 23:4-9), Sheol is never spoken of as something we can pick and choose.\n \n While we can remove or uncover the bodies or bones in a grave (2 Kings 23:16), the Scriptures never speak of man removing or uncovering anything in Sheol.\n \n While we can beautify a grave with ornate carvings or pictures (Gen. 35:20), Sheol is never beautified by man.\n \n While graves can be robbed or defiled (Jer. 8:1,2), Sheol is never spoken of as being robbed or defiled by man.\n \n While a grave can be destroyed by man (Jer. 8:1,2), nowhere in Scripture is man said to be able to destroy Sheol.\n \n While a grave can be full, Sheol is never full (Prov. 27:20). \n \n While we can see a grave, Sheol is always invisible.\n \n While we can visit the graves of loved ones, nowhere in Scripture is man said to visit Sheol.\n \n More on sheol in the link below.\n \n http://www.bible.ca/su-hades.htm",

   "I am in need of edification. There are posters on this forum who frequent the Religion section, for example EZRider and Prototype. They read the Bible and know a lot about it. Their position is that they are utterly certain what the Bible, and hence God Almighty, have to say about certain things, e.g., that which is moral and that which is not. As such, they cannot concede that any position other than theirs, which happens to completely coincide with Lord God Almighty, has any validity whatsoever. \n\n \n Well, a position on a certain subject can vary, but I've been pretty firmly rooted in my beliefs. Nevertheless, I do consider other arguements on this board, and on the (two?) topics I've posted on, I can't see where I was wrong or made a mistake or was closed-minded at all. The people who had different views from my own didn't concede or step-down, but they listened and considered what I said. How am I different?\n \n \nI ask the following. \n Have I got the above correct?\n\n \n You are correct that I read the Bible and know a lot about it. You are correct that I am utterly certain on what the Bible says and means. (I don't know all of it, of course.) But you are wrong in one thing. I am willing to concede that another person's view may be more correct than mine, but I've yet to see someone come up with actual scriptural evidence that refutes what I've said on those two topics.\n \n \nIf so, how can you possibly debate anyone, if you are already completely certain about these religious topics and there is no room for any deviation from your take on the Bible? \n\n \n Because I'm not debating myself. I'm debating other people and would like the chance to try and change their minds about something that I may feel differently about.\n \n \nYou quote the Bible and express your interpretation of it. I would venture to say that \"interpretation\" is the wrong word, because you seem to feel that the meaning of its words are completely obvious, and interpretation is not possible or needed. I have never seen you concede anyone else's interpretation of biblical meaning in the least. I mean, what's the point of discussion if you are already entirely confident that your positions are totally accurate because you are sure that God Almighty feels this way? What is there to debate?\n\n \n I'm not here to change my view. I came to debate others. I'd LIKE someone to try and change my view, but nobody has been successful thus far. \n \n And I don't feel all the Bible's meanings are totally obvious. If you happened to read my posts on the \"Is Bush The Antichrist?\" topic, you will see that I know the Bible is not always blatant and obvious about certain things\n \n \nI am not trying to bait you. \n\n \n Ack! Too Late!:) \n \n \nI want to understand this. Again if I am off base with this assertion,\n\n \n You kind of are.\n \n \n let me know. It sure seems to me that I am not. Please don't comment that I know nothing of the Bible or that I am an atheist, perverted, heathen bound for hell, I already concede that to you. Even so, I think it is a valid question. \n\n \n Of course it is. And I don't make assumptions like that, don't worry.",

(I have the KJV)\n\n \n You seem to have switched from your statement I replied to, to the Bible itself in general: so I will too.\n \n \n \n 1) Contrary to your claim, the Bible does not establish moral absolutes. \n \n That's why all three sides in the American Revolution (the pacifists, the revolutionists, and the loyalists) could all use the same Bible to justify their contradictory positions. \n \n That's why both pro- and anti-slavery people could use the same Bible to justify their contradictory positions. \n \n That's why people could justify killing others using the Bible, while others could use the Bible to condemn it. \n \n Thou shalt not kill? Except if the other person is gay!!!! \n \n (Or if the other person is a witch. Or if the other person has commited adultry. Or if the other person is a woman who isn't a virgin when she gets married. Or if the other person ....)\n \n \n \n 2) If you are asking how the Bible is biased, well, since it seems to be a hot topic around here, how about anti-gay bias (I could also go with anti-female bias, since the Bible is loaded with that too). A man who sleeps with another man has done something that, according to the Bible, is so detestable that that he MUST be killed, and that his blood will be on HIS head: not on the person who's doing the killing. That dehumanizes gays: that's a biased view of them.\n \n How much more biased can it be? It doesn't say, \"Don't talk to gay men because they are different\". It goes further. It doesn't say \"Gay men should be treated as second class citizens\". It goes further. In fact, it goes all the way to \"Gay men must be killed\". Biased? Gee, a tad.",

Or if the other person is a woman who isn't a virgin when she gets married. Or if the other person ....) \n\n \n The Bible does establish moral absolutes. It is men who interperate them to fit their attitudes and beliefs. They are those who have given birth to all these different sects of Christianity. Catholic, Lutheran, Protestants, Baptists and so on. There is a moral absolute, but there are so many different interpertations now that many people are skeptical of what it truly is.\n \n And also, I'd like to see any of the contradictions you claim to exist \n \n \n \n \n2) If you are asking how the Bible is biased, well, since it seems to be a hot topic around here, how about anti-gay bias (I could also go with anti-female bias, since the Bible is loaded with that too). A man who sleeps with another man has done something that, according to the Bible, is so detestable that that he MUST be killed, and that his blood will be on HIS head: not on the person who's doing the killing. That dehumanizes gays: that's a biased view of them. \n\n \n I believe you are thinking of the The Old Testament laws. Let me tell you that although such penalties are still upheld in the New Testament, but God is the one who enforces that sort of thing now. It is not bias in the Bible (I'm sure though, that there are Christians who are truly bias) but it is the law of the Bible that shapes their particular views on this. It is their choice to despise gays and women on purpose. But the Bible is not biased to women. I could show you a large list of women who were given some of the highest honors in the Bible. I don't think they were degraded.\n \n \nHow much more biased can it be? It doesn't say, \"Don't talk to gay men because they are different\". It goes further. It doesn't say \"Gay men should be treated as second class citizens\". It goes further. In fact, it goes all the way to \"Gay men must be killed\". Biased? Gee, a tad. \n\n \n No, it is not baised and is not an opinion either. You're looking at the Bible as something written by a person who had a spontaneous view on these issues. It isn't that all! Look on it as the law of a people. Bias has nothing to do with it. It is the one of the moral absolutes established in the Bible as a sin, and God did not establish these laws as hatred or bias.

   "Speaking of debates...\n \n Jesus' Resurrection: The Debate - Gary Habermas vs. (Atheist) Antony Flew\n \n Gary Habermas is a Distinguished Professor of Apologetics and Philosophy at Liberty University and is known for his fascinating and stimulating lectures. He has authored, co-authored, or edited twenty-two books including The Resurrection of Jesus, The Historical Jesus, Beyond Death, In Defense of Miracles, The Verdict of History, and has published over a hundred articles in top scholarly journals such as Religious Studies, Philosophia Christi, Christian Scholar's Review, Faith and Philosophy, and Biblioteca Sacra. Dr. Habermas holds an M.A. in philosophical theology from the University of Detroit; a D.D. in theology from Emmanuel College, Oxford; and Ph.D. in history and philosophy of religion from Michigan Sate University. \n \n Antony Flew has been among the most influential of atheist thinkers. Initially interested in paranormal research, he soon established himself as a powerful opponent of religious belief. He held teaching positions at the University of Oxford and the University of Aberdeen, and then Professorships at the University of Keele and the University of Reading. Among Flew's most influential works are his essays \"Theology and Falsification\" (in New Essays in Philosophical Theology) and \"The Presumption of Atheism\". In the former, he argued that theological claims should not be taken seriously because they cannot be falsified; in the latter, that atheism ought to be the default position, that the burden of proof on the question of God's existence lies with the theist. \n \n In late 2004 (after this debate), Flew announced that he had changed his mind and accepted the existence of God.

   "No foundation, dog.\n\n \n \n \n Are you calling the bible foundation for your belief? If so, run with it, it's yours to hold and cherish. Are you aware of the fact that the same book serves as the foundation for disbelief for many others? I realize that you truly believe as you say you do. What disturbs me is why you think others have bought into a lie for not believing as you do. When you place physical boundries on spirituality, it becomes as tainted and sinful as all that you are trying to rise above by being spiritual. You've decided that what you believe is the absolute truth, and I can tell you are very confident and content with your decision. Deciding that your belief is what everyone needs to have and should have, is where you fall off the balance beam. You do not know what is right for anyone else but yourself. Maybe you found Jesus because you felt you needed to or wanted to, or whatever. You got what you were seeking, be happy. \n It's one thing to claim that nonbelievers are victims of a big lie, but how do you explain Judaism? For Jews there is no new testament. It is nothing more than an unauthorized sequel to their original sacred scripture. Do they think you have believed a lie? No, they realize that you believe differently because your source of information is not the same as theirs. The same goes for Muslims and Hindus. I believe I am right by not believing in God as you do. But I won't allow myself to believe that you are somehow wrong, or damned, or lost by not sharing my philosophy. Mother Theresa believed that our job as Christians was not to convert the Jew or the Muslim, but to help them be the best Jew or Muslim they are capable of being. The human race is bonded by the human condition, not by the God we choose to believe or not believe in. \n In closing why is being \"right\" to others so important? Is it important enough to insist on telling others who don't agree with you that they are wrong? Right and wrong are used to represent winners and loosers in grade school spelling bees and little league games. Those terms are no longer applicable to adults when discussing the many worlds of invisible Gods. So far no God has come down to claim or disclaim his identity. I'm talking in our lifetime in a way that all human beings would recognize that it was indeed God. I know you'll say Jesus already did, but no he didn't. He confined himself to a very small area of the middle east, leaving out the vast majority of the world's population. Where is something profound being taught when God tells Abraham to sacrifice his son? How is this acceptable in any way shape or form? Because he is God and can do as he pleases with the mortals he created? That is one of many instances I can point out that make the bible a product of man and not the words and actions of an all loving, all knowing, all powerful, and all merciful God. And if it is God, I have no desire to spend eternity or even 5 minutes with such an evil being.\n I am sure you have a different feeling about that incident, but I am not going to say your're wrong if we don't agree. What I will make sure of is that I tell you \"no\" if you ever ask me to hike up a mountain and help you build a sacrificial altar.",

   "Speaking of debates...\n \n Jesus' Resurrection: The Debate - Gary Habermas vs. (Atheist) Antony Flew\n \n Gary Habermas is a Distinguished Professor of Apologetics and Philosophy at Liberty University and is known for his fascinating and stimulating lectures. He has authored, co-authored, or edited twenty-two books including The Resurrection of Jesus, The Historical Jesus, Beyond Death, In Defense of Miracles, The Verdict of History, and has published over a hundred articles in top scholarly journals such as Religious Studies, Philosophia Christi, Christian Scholar's Review, Faith and Philosophy, and Biblioteca Sacra. Dr. Habermas holds an M.A. in philosophical theology from the University of Detroit; a D.D. in theology from Emmanuel College, Oxford; and Ph.D. in history and philosophy of religion from Michigan Sate University. \n \n Antony Flew has been among the most influential of atheist thinkers. Initially interested in paranormal research, he soon established himself as a powerful opponent of religious belief. He held teaching positions at the University of Oxford and the University of Aberdeen, and then Professorships at the University of Keele and the University of Reading. Among Flew's most influential works are his essays \"Theology and Falsification\" (in New Essays in Philosophical Theology) and \"The Presumption of Atheism\". In the former, he argued that theological claims should not be taken seriously because they cannot be falsified; in the latter, that atheism ought to be the default position, that the burden of proof on the question of God's existence lies with the theist. \n \n In late 2004 (after this debate), Flew announced that he had changed his mind and accepted the existence of God. The burden of proof, he decided, can now be met following scientific advances that strengthen the argument to design. He continues, however, to reject all purported divine revelation, along with any possibility of an afterlife, describing himself as a deist rather than as a theist.\n \n http://www.arn.org/arnproducts/videos/veritas/ver72.htm\n \n p.s. It was reported that of the five judges of the Habermas / Flew debate, four had Habermas as the victor and 1 declared a tie.\n\n \n \n Wow for a conservative you sure are pretty liberal with your facts. Maybe next time read more than one slanted version of the events. That is unless your intention was to mislead anyone reading your post. Is this how you defend your ideology? Most of your facts are close but not quite, putting a spin that implies Christianity had gained credibility. Read up on some of what Flew said on why he changed his mind and what he now believes and it without question doesn't put him in the Christian camp. \n \n Here is a question for you\n \n If God came down from heaven and you knew it was God without a doubt, and he told you, commanded you to no longer believe one word of the Bible. He then goes back to Heaven without saying why he wants you to do this.

This attitude makes them unable to react any way BUT emotionally to people who disagree\n\n \n This is nonsense. Dallas Theological Seminary is a well respected seminary in scholarly circles.\n \n Regarding your boy Spong, he is a classical Biblical revisionist, a self-confessed recovering racist, and an apostate (or heretic if you prefer) to the Christian faith. His own diocese declined in numbers under his headship, as are liberal churches in general.\n \n His classic faux-pas is the following:\n \n Reforming Christology: He (Jesus) Did not Die for My Sins\n \n http://www.dioceseofnewark.org/vox30599.html\n \n Spong is also a dishonest con-artist, manipulating scriptures to advance his own failed theology, i.e.\n \n Spong the Greek \"scholar\"\n \n Spong boasts that he spends hours studying the Bible and professes an acquaintance with Koine Greek, the language the NT was first written in. Therefore it is not surprising that in RMR, where he denies Jesus' bodily resurrection, that he turns to an analysis of the Greek text to see what the Bible really means.\n \n In RMR p. 53-55, Spong draws our attention to Gal. 1:15-16a which says:\n \n v15 But when He who had set me apart, even from my mother's womb, called me through His grace, was pleased v16 to reveal His son in me ...\n \n From v. 16, \"to reveal His son in me\", Spong claims:\n \n This was not a physical body recalled from the grave. The word for \"reveal\" in this text is ophthe, the same word used in the Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures to describe the appearances of God (theophanies) or angels of God (angelophanies).... What was the nature of a theophany? Was it really \"physical\"? What was the means of hearing God's voice speak? Was it audible to any ear? Was it capable of being recorded or objectified?\n \n At first, we were impressed by this depth. But on checking a computerised concordance, we found that ophthe is sometimes used of ordinary physical \"seeing\" (Acts 7:26, 1 Tim. 3:16). A logician would also note that Spong commits the fallacy of false alternatives, because he overlooks the possibility that seeing could be both physical and supra-physical, rather that either/or. We thought that it was strange that Spong should ignore this point. However, we decided to check a Greek NT to see if Spong had at least analysed the word correctly in this passage. But we could not find ophthe in the passage. To give Spong a second shot, we checked a NT Greek Interlinear. The word was not there either. Instead, the Greek word for \"reveal\" in Gal. 1:16 is actually apokalupsai, not ophthe! Apokalupsai is often used in the NT in an objective sense.\n \n It is shocking to see that Spong was trying to attack traditional Christian belief by appealing to a mis-translation of a Greek word which is not even in the passage he is explaining. Prof. O'Collins is undoubtedly referring to this blunder when he wrote: \"What is said about a key verb St. Paul uses in Gal. 1:15f. shows that the bishop [Spong] has forgotten any Greek that he knew.\" Spong should heed O'Collins' kindly \"advice for his next book [which] is to let some real experts check it before publication.\"\n \n http://www.christian-apologetics.org/html/Whats_wrong_Spong.htm\n \n I can certainly see why you would defend him. You both believe the same revisionist nonsense. ROTFLOL!\n \n emoticon_xbouncer",

   "Why, it does have bearing on your comment about Homer though. You see, homer's works are not taken as the literal truth... and that is what you were comparing the bible too.\n\n \n Yes, but Homer doesn't claim to be. And there's not a very strong early evidence in the form of writings that demonstrate a succession of apostles, leaders, the journeys of Paul, etc. as there is with the Bible. (I'm talking about the writings of the early church)\n \n Since Homer has pretty much always been regarded as fiction, and there's about 2000 years of tradition of viewing the Bible as, if not true, then at least sacredly respected, then why should we not at least honor those who DO take it very seriously and respect their beliefs? (no one is saying you have to take it literally.) Particularly when you know it's offensive to some to belittle the things they consider very sacred.\n \n I've used this example before here, but I wonder if you'd go into a person's home, and start making belittling remarks about a funeral urn on the mantle, questioning aloud whether it's truly, really the ashes of their beloved grandparent. I wonder if you'd go in and start making claims that it's probably firewood ashes that someone put in there, or that over the years other things got mixed in when transferring the ashes from one urn to another. Would you take the attitude of jumping at any given opportunity to belittle that urn and what it may contain even if you did have reason to believe the contents might not be what the family thought was in there? The problem I have with your crusade to belittle and question Christianity at every given opportunity is that people take religion very sacredly. In my view, the real issue here about your crusade is not whether or not the ashes are real--it's the fact that those ashes are very, very, sacred and deeply important to people. The Bible is of enormous deep importance to them, like the funeral urn on the mantle. When you belittle that, you are being very offensive to them. And it's no wonder that they get defensive and even combative with you and others that do the same thing. And it would be totally different if you treated the matter with respect, carefully and respectfully sharing your opinion that the ashes might not be the real deal. There are only two possibilties here: either you don't realize how offensive it is (and so I'm telling you), or you just simply don't care about people. All I can say is, I would hope it's the former, because the second possibility wouldn't say much for you.\n \n \nAnd, from the evidence, I think the probability that the bible is accurate in a historical sense is near zero percent. \n\n \n Yes, maybe there are some firewood remains mixed in with grandpa's ashes in that urn. Somehow I don't see the value in sharing that opinion with grandma every single chance you can.",

   "Is the whole chapter in error then? Or can you not see the comparision to the Christ?\n \n 6But I [am] a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised by the people. 7All they that see me deride me: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, [saying], 8He trusted on the LORD [that] he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him. 9But thou [art] he that brought me forth into life: thou didst make me hope [when I was] upon my mother's breasts. 10I was cast upon thee from my birth: thou [art] my God from the time I was born. 11Be not far from me; for trouble [is] near; for [there is] none to help. 12Many bulls have compassed me: strong [bulls] of Bashan have beset me round. 13They gaped upon me [with] their mouths, [as] a ravening and a roaring lion. 14I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels. 15My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death. 16For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet. 17I may number all my bones: they look [and] stare upon me. 18They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture. \n \n But let's discount this Psalm altogether if you'd like. \n What do you do with Isaiah 53 or countless other prophecies, prophetic types of wording of the coming Messiah?\n I mean you really do not think you can discount them all?\n I do appreciate proper translation. But what does that really mean? \n There are many words where meaning is debate worthy. For instance the word \"air\", \"forever\",\"hell\" etc. \n They do not carry the same meaning as our english, I do understand the condundrum of mistranslation but I have to take the full context surrounding any biblical passage and with that...the bible is pretty fluid in what it says.\n \n More importantly God is the one who reveals the matter.\n If you take away my bible..so, I trust in being led of the Spirit not the letter of the law or books anyway.\n With no bible men still act out of their hearts.\n \n I personally can find direct contradictions between editions, can't you?\n And it erks me that some group of suppossed scholars cannot get the original greek or hebrew right. But then again people back then had broad meaning to their words at times which allowed for relative interpretation.\n Hell for some meant to be shut out, for others it meant the garbage heap. Hell for others might mean unknown judgment from a Holy God.\n \n What's my point?\n Belief in God, a god or diety was usually never the issue for most people throughout history. Ascribing meaning to God, that god or diety was always an issue. Jesus clarified Old testament law but his meaning went deeper or to the heart where the priest could only see it at a surface level.\n God leaves room for doubt, but a wise man seeks the matter out.\n \n The disciples asked Jesus to speak plainly. Jesus said he spoke so that (the people at large) hearing they would not hear and seeing they would not see.\n \n Now is he just mean? Or cliquish?\n I think he knew you cannot use any language and talk to a group of people and expect them all to translate it, it being his words, into an exact meaning. Different people understand based on their own frame of reference. But he knew that unless they recieved HIS words, HIS meaning they would invariably miss the point.\n \n Enough, I labor too much me thinks.\n Your thoughts?",

   "Hitler a Christian? Horse dung!\n \n Jesus himself provided a number of clues as to what constituted a true Christian. First, he warned his followers about \"Wolves in sheep's clothing\" - an obvious indication that not everyone who will claim to follow Christ would be a Christian. History is full of these wolves and charlatans. But then, Jesus said one more thing that by which people would know who is and who is not a Christian: \"You shall know them by their fruits.\" Obviously, Hitler's \"fruits\" / works were heinous and against almost everything that Jesus taught. Instead of \"Love your neighbor,\" Hitler invaded and murdered his neighbors. He committed almost every despicable crime there was. So, I think anyone who wants to argue that Hitler was a Christian has to take that into consideration. \n \n We also have these quotations from Adolph Hitler that indicate his twisted mentality, and his hatred of true Christianity: \n \n \"Christianity is an invention of sick brains,\" Adolf Hitler, December 13, 1941.\n \"So it's not opportune to hurl ourselves now into a struggle with the Churches. The best thing is to let Christianity die a natural death,\" Adolf Hitler, October 14, 1941.\n \n Night of 11th-12th July, 1941: \n National Socialism and religion cannot exist together.... The heaviest blow that ever struck humanity was the coming of Christianity. Bolshevism is Christianity's illegitimate child. Both are inventions of the Jew. The deliberate lie in the matter of religion was introduced into the world by Christianity.... Let it not be said that Christianity brought man the life of the soul, for that evolution was in the natural order of things. (p 6 & 7) \n \n \n 10th October, 1941, midday: \n Christianity is a rebellion against natural law, a protest against nature. Taken to its logical extreme, Christianity would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure. (p 43)\n \n \n 14th October, 1941, midday: \n The best thing is to let Christianity die a natural death.... When understanding of the universe has become widespread...

   "Hitler a Christian? Horse dung!\n \n Jesus himself provided a number of clues as to what constituted a true Christian. First, he warned his followers about \"Wolves in sheep's clothing\" - an obvious indication that not everyone who will claim to follow Christ would be a Christian. History is full of these wolves and charlatans. But then, Jesus said one more thing that by which people would know who is and who is not a Christian: \"You shall know them by their fruits.\" Obviously, Hitler's \"fruits\" / works were heinous and against almost everything that Jesus taught. Instead of \"Love your neighbor,\" Hitler invaded and murdered his neighbors. He committed almost every despicable crime there was. So, I think anyone who wants to argue that Hitler was a Christian has to take that into consideration. \n \n We also have these quotations from Adolph Hitler that indicate his twisted mentality, and his hatred of true Christianity: \n \n \"Christianity is an invention of sick brains,\" Adolf Hitler, December 13, 1941.\n \"So it's not opportune to hurl ourselves now into a struggle with the Churches. The best thing is to let Christianity die a natural death,\" Adolf Hitler, October 14, 1941.\n \n Night of 11th-12th July, 1941: \n National Socialism and religion cannot exist together.... The heaviest blow that ever struck humanity was the coming of Christianity. Bolshevism is Christianity's illegitimate child. Both are inventions of the Jew. The deliberate lie in the matter of religion was introduced into the world by Christianity.... Let it not be said that Christianity brought man the life of the soul, for that evolution was in the natural order of things. (p 6 & 7) \n \n \n 10th October, 1941, midday: \n Christianity is a rebellion against natural law, a protest against nature. Taken to its logical extreme, Christianity would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure. (p 43)\n \n \n 14th October, 1941, midday: \n The best thing is to let Christianity die a natural death.... When understanding of the universe has become widespread... Christian doctrine will be convicted of absurdity.... Christianity has reached the peak of absurdity....

   "I am in need of edification. There are posters on this forum who frequent the Religion section, for example EZRider and Prototype. They read the Bible and know a lot about it. Their position is that they are utterly certain what the Bible, and hence God Almighty, have to say about certain things, e.g., that which is moral and that which is not. As such, they cannot concede that any position other than theirs, which happens to completely coincide with Lord God Almighty, has any validity whatsoever. \n \n I ask the following. \n Have I got the above correct?\n \n If so, how can you possibly debate anyone, if you are already completely certain about these religious topics and there is no room for any deviation from your take on the Bible?\n \n You quote the Bible and express your interpretation of it. I would venture to say that \"interpretation\" is the wrong word, because you seem to feel that the meaning of its words are completely obvious, and interpretation is not possible or needed. I have never seen you concede anyone else's interpretation of biblical meaning in the least. I mean, what's the point of discussion if you are already entirely confident that your positions are totally accurate because you are sure that God Almighty feels this way? What is there to debate?\n \n I am not trying to bait you. I want to understand this. Again if I am off base with this assertion, let me know. It sure seems to me that I am not. Please don't comment that I know nothing of the Bible or that I am an atheist, perverted, heathen bound for hell, I already concede that to you. Even so, I think it is a valid question.\n\n \n What is different about the fundamentalist believers certainty and literal interpretation of the bible when compared to the unmoving and irrational acceptence of evolution by the humanist ? Have evos just changed their adament defense of it without experiencing some supernatural epiphime ? I think not. At least my dedication to God is based on a personal relationship with Him that has lasted more than 30 years. Unlike the flimsy hope evos have that their belief system turns out to be true, and not some terrible misinterpretation of the available observations Man has made through out our existence.\n \n So debating will never change my beliefs or shake my faith in Christ but debating for believers is our desire to share the greater truths we have learned with people who are where we were at before we were saved.",

You have confirmed that, saying that your 30 relationship with God is all the evidence you need and there is nothing that anyone anytime could tell you that would make you change your mind. \n \n Furthermore, your response is that the same degree of certitude exists for proponents of veracity of evolution. I disagree and would like to explain why.\n \n First, let me state it more generally, that there is nothing in science that could not change a scientist's mind about some accepted fact, given the proper contradictory evidence. I know you don't believe that. When it comes to evolution, it is hard to make it sound credible when I say that if given the right evidence, scientists would deny the idea that evolution explains our diverse biology. That is only because evolution is a really good theory and it would take a LOT of convincing to change one's mind about it, but it isn't impossible. It's a really good theory because it does such an excellent job of explaining all that we observe, without any contradictions. Moreover, it has effectively been predictive of observations that are subsequently found. So a good theory is explanatory and predictive. If enough evidence were found that didn't fit with the theory, it would be debunked. \n \n Conversely, there is no objectively observable evidence for God and all the stuff in the Bible (Creation, Noah, Moses, Virgin births, Resurrections, etc.) None whatsoever. In addition there is a great deal of evidence that confirms that none of that can possibly be true. \n \n If there were enough evidence (or any evidence) to falsify evolution, of course scientists would change their minds. \n \n I know you don't believe this, so let me present two examples, gravity and beta-blockers for heart failure. \n \n If I drop an orange, you can predict it will fall to the ground. If someone states that there is a place in Estonia where the orange will not fall, but will stay suspended, you would not likely believe this. Why? I suggest because all that you know about the way the world works, everything you have observed your entire life is contrary to this. It would take a huge amount of evidence for you to believe that oranges float in Estonia. That is because the \"theory\" that things fall when you drop them is a really good one. All observations to date confirm this and you can predict with certainty the behavior of things when you drop them. This is like evolution.\n \n Now, in medicine, there are these drugs called beta blockers. Among many other things, they cause the heart to beat more slowly and less forcefully. For this reason they are used to treat high blood pressure. In a condition called congestive heart failure, the heart is not pumping effectively. It would seem like a terrible idea to give a person whose heart is not pumping enough, a drug that had been demonstrated in the lab to lower the amount of blood the heart pumps. In fact, 20-30 years ago, it would be malpractice to give beta-blockers to a person with heart failure. It was a fact. \n \n However, somebody looked at the numbers and found that some people with heart failure happened to do OK if they were put on beta blockers, in fact, they did better. As it turns out there is a lot more going on in heart failure than we then knew. Now, one routinely treats patients who have CHF with beta blockers.\n \n Scientists changed their mind. This happens all the time. No one gets upset or hurt or defensive. People were overjoyed, in fact, that there exists another treatment that prolongs people's lives. More facts come to light and our thoughts about how the world worked changed. We were wrong before. Are we right now? Who the hell knows, but this is the best we can do for now. \n \n Not so with religion. You ideas are set in stone. Facts that appears to contradict the religious belief are not even considered. Not even considered!! That is the difference I am talking about.",

I disagree and would like to explain why.\n \n First, let me state it more generally, that there is nothing in science that could not change a scientist's mind about some accepted fact, given the proper contradictory evidence. I know you don't believe that. When it comes to evolution, it is hard to make it sound credible when I say that if given the right evidence, scientists would deny the idea that evolution explains our diverse biology. That is only because evolution is a really good theory and it would take a LOT of convincing to change one's mind about it, but it isn't impossible. It's a really good theory because it does such an excellent job of explaining all that we observe, without any contradictions. Moreover, it has effectively been predictive of observations that are subsequently found. So a good theory is explanatory and predictive. If enough evidence were found that didn't fit with the theory, it would be debunked. \n \n Conversely, there is no objectively observable evidence for God and all the stuff in the Bible (Creation, Noah, Moses, Virgin births, Resurrections, etc.) None whatsoever. In addition there is a great deal of evidence that confirms that none of that can possibly be true. \n \n If there were enough evidence (or any evidence) to falsify evolution, of course scientists would change their minds. \n \n I know you don't believe this, so let me present two examples, gravity and beta-blockers for heart failure. \n \n If I drop an orange, you can predict it will fall to the ground. If someone states that there is a place in Estonia where the orange will not fall, but will stay suspended, you would not likely believe this. Why? I suggest because all that you know about the way the world works, everything you have observed your entire life is contrary to this. It would take a huge amount of evidence for you to believe that oranges float in Estonia. That is because the \"theory\" that things fall when you drop them is a really good one. All observations to date confirm this and you can predict with certainty the behavior of things when you drop them. This is like evolution.\n \n Now, in medicine, there are these drugs called beta blockers. Among many other things, they cause the heart to beat more slowly and less forcefully. For this reason they are used to treat high blood pressure. In a condition called congestive heart failure, the heart is not pumping effectively. It would seem like a terrible idea to give a person whose heart is not pumping enough, a drug that had been demonstrated in the lab to lower the amount of blood the heart pumps. In fact, 20-30 years ago, it would be malpractice to give beta-blockers to a person with heart failure. It was a fact. \n \n However, somebody looked at the numbers and found that some people with heart failure happened to do OK if they were put on beta blockers, in fact, they did better. As it turns out there is a lot more going on in heart failure than we then knew. Now, one routinely treats patients who have CHF with beta blockers.\n \n Scientists changed their mind. This happens all the time. No one gets upset or hurt or defensive. People were overjoyed, in fact, that there exists another treatment that prolongs people's lives. More facts come to light and our thoughts about how the world worked changed. We were wrong before. Are we right now? Who the hell knows, but this is the best we can do for now. \n \n Not so with religion. You ideas are set in stone. Facts that appears to contradict the religious belief are not even considered. Not even considered!! That is the difference I am talking about.\n\n \n \n I understand what you mean and I agree that we are less flexible about our beliefs. My point regarding evo was that even though you will adjust your thinking about certain aspects of it, you will defend evo itself to the death. I just understand that there are more unanswered questions and unknowns about our past that science can never answer given the amount of info we have. Yet people speak to events of millions of years ago with the surety as if it happened within our own lifetime. \n \n As to my belief in the bible as Gods word, I understand how little we actually know about our ancient past. And that it's been impossible to absolutely disprove the bible as much as so many have tried to. I believe Evo is mans attempt to create a history for mans origins without having God in the equation. This is why I refer to it as a false religion. Because even though evolutionists don't define it as a religion, it is a belief system that is intended to define the origins of humanity, a study previously religated to the spiritual side of mans identity rather than the scientific.",

Yet people speak to events of millions of years ago with the surety as if it happened within our own lifetime. \n\n \n I think you are mistaken. No one will \"defend evolution to the death\". The evidence is just so overwhelming that it is hard to budge on it. Also, it makes perfect intuitive sense: If you have some variety in a population that makes some individuals more likely to survive than others, the ones more likely to survive will survive more. It also has been observed to actually occur. \n \n If you told me that you had evidence that gravity doesn't exist, I would be very skeptical. The evidence thus far (I thought) was overwhelming. That is why evolutionary biologists are \"so sure\". The evidence in its favor is enormous and continues every day!! It is by far the best explanation thus far. \n \n It is not true at all that \"people speak to events of millions of years ago with the surety as if it happened within our own lifetime\" Events of long ago, like occurrences gillions of miles from here in space are inferred by indirect means - the only means possible, of course, when direct observation is impossible. The corroboration between multiple observation leads to some confidence that the inferences are correct. That is all. \n \n How is it you can speak of events of the past spoken about in the Bible with such assuredness when there is no corroboration with any observations we make today?\n \n \n \n \n As to my belief in the bible as Gods word, I understand how little we actually know about our ancient past.

Because even though evolutionists don't define it as a religion, it is a belief system that is intended to define the origins of humanity, a study previously religated to the spiritual side of mans identity rather than the scientific. \n\n \n You have this hit on the exact reason you have a problem with evolution. You don't seem to have a problem with any other field of science, however. \n \n Evolution science seeks to understand our origins, as you say, but it doesn't specifically intend to do it without God in the equation. God doesn't enter into it because there is a perfectly plausible explanation without God. The data observed do not lead one to conclude that God had a hand in it. The data do not specifically exclude God or anything else, but there is no reason to suggest there is an additional need for a God when the explanation is sufficient in itself. Scientists never not start out trying to exclude ANY possibility, though I know you can't believe it. \n \n Seeking out our origins was previously relegated to religion as you say. But those explanations are unsatisfactory when examined more closely. And they were the explanations of a people who did not understand what we do now.\n We examine every difficult question in our lives with science. Why should we exclude understanding the origin of life with science when we use science to understand everything else. We don't use religion to understand germ theory or physics or chemistry. Why should it enter into this aspect of biology?",

My point is that according to THE MASSIVE ASSUMPTIONS OF THE ARTICLE POSTED., this massive explosion took place in the outer reaches of Time and Space between 8.8 and 20 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since. To put this as simply as possible, if we are seeing to the edge of our own Universe, which the article doesn't even say. But say's we are viewing Stars within our own Galaxy only. How are they assuming they are seeing stars that were formed at the time of the big Bang and not formed by the shock wave caused by its concussion as it spread through out time and space. It may have taken the Big Bang Shockwave another 5 billion years or so to make it to the place where our Universe/ Galaxy/ Solar System exists within Time and Space in relation to where it started which would be considered Ground Zero of the Big Bang.\n \n My point is that our scientists are attempting to age the Universe based on info that that doesn't even go past our Galaxy is so incomplete it's impossible to make such estimates with any hope of accuracy. Admittedly we have millions, or billions of Universes even. The distance from the beginning of the furthest Universe would represent be the actual age of our Universe as it would represent the actual beginning of Time and Space. But of course this new age comes with 95% certainty that they are right. And you say science isn't full of comedians. emoticon_xgood \n \n Age of Universe Revised, Again \n By Robert Roy Britt\n Senior Science Writer\n posted: 11:22 am ET\n 03 January 2003\n \n We speculated just last week in our Top 10 Space Mysteries [See #8] that the ongoing effort to figure out how hold the universe is would yield at least one more estimate during 2003.\n \n We had no idea it would come so soon.\n \n In a study published today in the journal Science, a team of researchers says the universe is between 11.2 billion and 20 billion years old.\n \n Most estimates in recent years have ranged between 10 billion and 15 billion years. Last year, data supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope led to an apparently refined estimate of 13 billion to 14 billion years.\n \n  The new calculations, by Lawrence Krauss of Case Western Reserve University and Brian Chaboyer at Dartmouth College, involved new information about old star clusters in our galaxy and a better understanding of how stars evolve. It was based on when stars are thought to end the main sequence of their lives, a point at which they've used up the hydrogen that fuels thermonuclear fusion and therefore begin to dim.\n \n The new appraisal comes with a 95 percent level of confidence, which means the door is still open for further revision and that last year's tighter Hubble estimate might prove on track.\n \n The new estimates were made as part of a larger effort to understand how the universe is structured, and they agree with an increasingly solid case suggesting that 95 percent of the universe is controlled by so-called dark energy. Scientists don't know what this mysterious force is, or how it works, but they see evidence of it in the fact that the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate.",

Until we can prove the supernatural then ID is not a Science. I would ask you to look at the evidence for Evolution again, have a look at it with a open mind.\n\n \n I can't believe you dont see how what you wrote in the bolded doesn't fly in the face of reason. When dealing with unknowable, unprovable and unanswerable questions from our perspective, the only right thing to do is to give a perfect and Holy God the benefit of the doubt and take His Word literally until we have reliable evidence to the contrary.",

And I didn't say that our data is limited to just our galaxy but this article from H_I_M states clearly their result is derived from observing Stars in our Galaxy. I didn't assume that, the article say's it. See ?\n \n \nThe new calculations, by Lawrence Krauss of Case Western Reserve University and Brian Chaboyer at Dartmouth College, involved new information about old star clusters in our galaxy and a better understanding of how stars evolve. It was based on when stars are thought to end the main sequence of their lives, a point at which they've used up the hydrogen that fuels thermonuclear fusion and therefore begin to dim.\n \n\n \n Now, as you say and I know that our Galaxy is potentially one of millions within our own Universe, in order to determine the age of the universe by observing stars in our Galaxy, one must assume that the whole complete Universe expanded from the big bang simultaneously and also instantaneously creating all of the Solar Systems, Galaxies and Universes within our Quadrant of Space at the same moment in time. Excuse me for saying it but I think that's presuming a heck of a lot.\n \n Now, why don't you go read up on some basic cosmology before you try defending it ?",

In my simple Christian view of Time and Space, there has never been the slightest doubt that millions of Universes exist that support their own Galaxies and Solar Systems. That would more accurately define eternity and the endlessness of time and Space in my mind. Simply put, our single Universe just isn't big enough to define all of Eternity. And even the finite mind of the natural Worlds scientists consider it a valid question. see ?\n \n http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/generalscience/5mysteries_universes_020205-1.html\n \n To understand why, you have to go back to the Big Bang, that mysterious, mother-of-all-explosions that most astronomers believe spawned our universe. One second, according to theory, there was nothingness. The next, our cosmos sprang into existence. Nature seems to have pulled off the feat of getting something -- in fact, everything -- for nothing. able --<\n \n As unimaginable as that sounds, it comes straight out of the theory of quantum mechanics, a set of mathematical rules that describe how the universe works on the smallest scales, inside atoms. Quantum mechanics says that matter and energy can appear spontaneously out of the vacuum of space, thanks to something called a quantum fluctuation, a sort of hiccup in the energy field thought to pervade the cosmos.\n \n Cosmologists say that a quantum fluctuation gave rise to the Big Bang. And the thing about quantum fluctuations is that they can happen anywhere, any time. And if our universe was born out of a quantum fluctuation, say theorists, then it's possible that other quantum fluctuations could have spawned other universes.\n \n Now tell me again who's lacking an understanding of Cosmology ?",

   "The point is that any other universes that exist by definition cannot be connected to ours, so their existence is entirely hypothetical, if we were able to observe them then they would not be separate universes at all. The observable evidence says nothing about what was around \"before\" (I use the term advisedly because our current understanding is that time is a property of the universe and hence there is no before) the big bang, the explanation from quantum theory is entirely speculative at this point.\n \n As for this universe not being big enough, the evidence suggests that it may well be infinite, in space at least. In time we don't know, certainly it seems there was a beginning, cosmologists are divided on the possibility of an end.\n \n To me, the awesome scale of the cosmos speaks more truly than Genesis could of the power and majesty of God, and the discoveries of science are complementary to the Bible. On the one hand we know that God created us in his image, on the other science reveals to us the scope of the undertaking, the sheer enormity of the lengths God has gone to in order to bring his plan to fruition, in which the sacrifice of his son for us stands not as the lone peak of God's love but as the highest in a mountain range of actions that go beyond \"moving heaven and earth\", but moving galaxies, stars, planets, continents, plants, animals, the works, over the course of 14 billion years, with the object of creating humanity.
