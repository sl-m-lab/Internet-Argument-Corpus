The vote is set in the senate and the Us will change from the United States of America to the United States of Corporations. The senate is about to annoint something we have never had in this country a King. King George; I will be waiting to see his coronation as all three branches of his government will be under his controll. He believes in many things a king of old would do spy on the people, hold people without charge or trial, and torture. I wonder if this is what is was like when the Roman republic died?",

   "This is simply the \"end game.\" It is no secret to anyone what the Presidents conservative agenda is in regard to the supreme court. They avoid coming right out and saying it, but we all know. All the pawns are in place for King George's \"end game.\" \n \n But mark my word, when Roe Vs. Wade gets overturned, and the constitution is amended to oppress gays, there will be violence in the streets. There is going to ba a LOT of unhappy women voters (and gays as well) but as we all have learned by now, voting isn't all it's cracked up to be here in the USA.\n \n Being pro-life myself, you would think I would be rejoicing. But I am not. It's a sad day for all America. The clock of progression will get set back 30 years.\n \n The government will soon be in your bedroom. Get used to it or get tear gassed. Heil Bush.",
