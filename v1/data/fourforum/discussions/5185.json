It would be pretty redundant to take the test as a senior. When the AP tests here were made mandatory, seniors were known to have taken their tests in spanish. I think it's pretty funny myself, but the district definitely does not--- each test costs $85.\n \n Here are the multiple choice essay topics I remember.\n \n Evaluate the economy of the Mass. Bay Colony with that of.. somewhere else that I don't remember.. (I didn't choose that one)\n \n Evaluate the sectional perspectives (North, South, West) of the Mexican-American War and the resulting debate. (I chose this one.. unfortunately I forgot the name of 'The Wilmot Proviso.. so I just referred to it as legislation demanding that the Mexican cessions not be made into slave territory.. I hope my grader doesn't mind)\n \n I think those were the two essay options from the 1st question.\n \n I only remember one of the questions from the second series which went something like this:\n \n Discuss the social impact of the following:\n Choose two of the three\n \n Civil rights movement\n Antiwar movement\n .. and I can't remember the last one.. probably because I didn't do it.\n \n One of the things that I was surprised by was how little the time restriction effected my testing. I was done with the writing portion with about 15 minutes remaining.\n \n The result really won't have much of an impact on myself.. it will probably just be an issue of pride. I also have this theory that with very strong AP test results, schools won't even consider your GPA (not that I have a bad one, I have a 3.88.. but my class rank probably isn't too strong considering my public school is 'one of the best' in the country).\n \n Duo, have you taken the AP Euro or AP Government tests? If so, how hard were they? I'm taking those classes next year.",

The biggest problem I had with them was actually the cost of taking the four of them, it sucked not getting a refund on the latin though. \n As far as the history test went most of the dbq's were pretty easy, with the essays being only a little difficult. As far as the grading thing goes however though they don't spend alot of time on each test, they do know what to look for in a response so don't skim on the details.
