   "The Learning Lag\n July 7, 2006\n From Plato's school of philosophy to the medieval universities of Paris and Bologna to the unrivaled German research institutions of the early 20th century, European higher education has an illustrious history. But in the here and now the Continent is sliding into educational obscurity.\n \n Only two European universities, Cambridge and Oxford, make the top 10 in Shanghai Jiao Tong University's global rating system; the rest are in the U.S. Of the top 50, nine are in Europe. The U.S. isn't the only competition. A list of undergraduate schools attended by the world's top computer scientists includes the Indian Institute of Technology, National Taiwan University and Seoul National University.\n \n A new report from the Center for European Reform, a London think tank, shows how bad things have gotten. There are twice as many European students in the U.S. as there are Americans studying in Europe. And while Yanks tend to take a semester abroad of undergraduate art or history (with a minor in clubbing), European students go to America for full-degree programs, at higher levels, and with a greater emphasis on science and technology, say the report's authors, Richard Lambert, head of the Confederation of British Industry, and Nick Butler, BP Group Vice President.\n \n Their diagnosis of the problem is straightforward. With private universities still unusual, and private funding in the form of either donations or tuition payments uncommon, most European schools are almost entirely dependent on the state.\n \n One result is micromanagement. In Italy, for example, cabinet-level approval can be required to appoint a professor. In some German regions, meanwhile, trivial expenses must be approved by state bureaucrats.\n \n Many European universities can't select their students but have to accept anyone who meets standard criteria, usually minimum exam scores. As education is free, students -- particularly in countries, like France, with high youth unemployment -- tend to take their sweet time to graduate, if they do at all. Drop-out rates are about 40% across the EU, compared with one-third among OECD members.\n \n Universities are also starved of cash. Public funding for higher education, in the EU as in the U.S., represents about 1% of GDP. In the U.S., though, private financing adds another 1.4% of GDP, while in the EU it adds only 0.1%.\n \n Fixing the problem is the tough part. Messrs. Lambert and Butler suggest more independence for universities, as well as better incentives to private giving. Tuition payments would also be a boon, they point out, not least because they would transform students from wards of the state into customers -- and thus make them far less likely to tolerate substandard teaching.\n \n Britain recently raised the ceiling on annual tuition fees, from \u00a31,250 ($2,293) to \u00a33,000 ($5,532). Now the government is considering raising the cap further, while Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown wants to change the tax code to encourage alumni giving. In recent years Germany has allowed schools to hand pick some of their students and pay more competitive salaries. Ideas like these will be on the table later this month when J\u00e1n Figel, the EU education commissioner, hosts a Brussels conference to discuss the Lambert-Butler report.\n \n Addressing the shortcomings will take a change in mindsets as much as anything concrete. Last month, 10,000 Greek students marched in protest, a few hurling gasoline bombs at police. Their grievance? Legislation that would impose a fixed time period to earn a degree, ending the widespread Greek phenomenon of the \"eternal student.\" They also objected to a proposed constitutional amendment (yes, that's what it would take) to allow private universities.\n \n In the meantime, Greece has the largest net outflow of students among all 25 EU members, with some 9% leaving every year. Without change, Greece can probably say good-bye to more of its brightest young people every year. The same can be said for European universities as a whole.\n \n From the Wall Street Journal",

   "There's no methodology attached to those university ratings, if it's the one I'm thinking of then a major component is citations in research papers. It has little to do with assessment of teaching, as the article seems to imply. Given that there are more universities in the US and a clear pyramid as regards their standing, it's hardly surprising they rate higher. It's not an objective measure by any means. A report from the CBI and BP hardly makes for an objective stance either. Incidentally there is already a private university in the UK, and it is not particularly accomplished.\n \n Few of the problems of independence of universities apply to the UK anyway, top-up fees, if anything, have brought in more regulation in their wake. Fees have simply been an attempt by the Thatcherite Blair government for marketise higher education, which was opposed by the majority of students, academics and the population as a whole. The problem British universities have is chronic underfunding, and a government unprepared to make a case for raising taxes.\n \n Ah, just found the methodology link:\n http://ed.sjtu.edu.cn/rank/2005/ARWU2005Methodology.htm\n \n There are huge problems with the methodology, even on its own terms. For example, nobel prizes in physics can only be awarded for practical advances, not advances in theory. So, the general theory of relativity would not be eligible for a nobel prize, penalising departments that specialise in theory. There is no evaluation of teaching quality, no evaluation of employability after graduation, in fact no assessment at all of the student experience, which the article seems to be focussed on.\n \n Incidentally my own university makes it into the top 203-300 according to that.",
