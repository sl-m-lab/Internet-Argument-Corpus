What you say can and will be held against ye.\n\n \n Yes, but to a certain extent. Unless this particular piece of speech is utterly repulsive or a threat, then the First Amendment does apply, and the individual's speech rights should be protected.\n \n \n \n \n \nReductio ad absurdum my good stout fellow!\n\n \n For the record, I had no idea what the whole steryo thing meant.\n \n \n \nCapri states that he should not be subject to random drug testing BECAUSE he is free to do what he will in the privacy of his own home. I noted that there are a number of activities one may conduct in the privacy of one's home that will result in one relocating to a much smaller housing unit complete with bars and a feeding schedule. To recap: If X depends on Y and you disprove Y, you disprove X. Tah Dah! Try it yourself, it's neat!\n\n \n Yes but we're not talking about someone engaging in certain activities in their homes. Were talking about the government barging in and forcing you to be tested, without proof of you even doing anything. The point I'm trying to make is that there is no solid evidence that anyone even did anything, so we are eliminating the whole \"activity\" thing all together.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nIf I were you at this point, I would undoubtedly write \"relevance?\" in response.\n\n \n I was somewhat mocking what you were doing, however I see my attempts were futile emoticon_confused.\n \n \n \n \nAbsodamnlutely. I don't give a whit for your mental condition once you draw down on a member of my family. My wife is no less dead because her murderer was 14 or had the IQ of a rutabaga.\n\n \n I am not debating the state of your wife, I am debating if the murderer can be held accountable, and what holding him/her accountable will accomplish.\n \n \n \n \nNice try at Reductio Ad absurbum. Unfortunately the goal of RAA is to get your oppontent to recognize the absurdity. I see no absurdity in punishing the crime, not the criminal.\n\n \n I was countering your RAA with another RAA. Punishing the mentally ill is absurd, just as throwing a 4 year old on death row is absurd.",

This vaccine has been tested in over 11,000 females (ages 9-26 years) around the world. These studies have shown no serious side effects. The most common side effect is soreness at the injection site. CDC, working with the FDA, will continue to monitor the safety of the vaccine after it is in general use.\n ...\n the vaccine does not protect against all types of HPV, it will not prevent all cases of cervical cancer or genital warts.

Even testing on adults was very limited.\nThe data Merck presented to the FDA were based on some 21,000 test subjects between ages 16 and 26, half of whom received Gardasil and half a placebo. All subjects, followed for up to five years, were found free of pre-cancerous changes from the targeted strains.\n \n Some critics pointed out that the test period was too short to assess long-term effects and efficacy. In fact, the studies on children, who often react differently to drugs, were shorter yet, and smaller. Only 1,184 subjects in the nine to 15 year-old age test group got Gardasil, and they were followed for 18 months, according to New Scientist magazine.

There is simply no justification for making this mandatory and no way I would let my 13-year old get it...\n\n \n i find it interesting that you quote the CDC website but leave out these items on that very same website:\n \nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently licensed this vaccine for use in girls/women, ages 9-26 years. The vaccine is given through a series of three shots over a six-month period.\n \n\n \n\n \n The HPV vaccine is recommended for 11-12 year-old girls, and can be given to girls as young as 9. The vaccine is also recommended for 13-26 year-old girls/women who have not yet received or completed the vaccine series. \n \n These recommendations have been proposed by the ACIP-a national group of experts that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on vaccine issues. These recommendations are now being considered by CDC.\n \n\n \n and\n \nWhy is the HPV vaccine recommended for such young girls?\n Ideally, females should get the vaccine before they are sexually active. This is because the vaccine is most effective in girls/women who have not yet acquired any of the four HPV types covered by the vaccine. Girls/women who have not been infected with any of those four HPV types will get the full benefits of the vaccine. \n \n Will sexually active females benefit from the vaccine?\n Females who are sexually active may also benefit from the vaccine. But they may get less benefit from the vaccine since they may have already acquired one or more HPV type(s) covered by the vaccine. Few young women are infected with all four of these HPV types. So they would still get protection from those types they have not acquired. Currently, there is no test available to tell if a girl/woman has had any or all of these four HPV types.\n \n Why is the HPV vaccine only recommended for girls/women ages 9 to 26? \n The vaccine has been widely tested in 9-to-26 year-old girls/women. But research on the vaccine's safety and efficacy has only recently begun with women older than 26 years of age. The FDA will consider licensing the vaccine for these women when there is research to show that it is safe and effective for them. \n \n\n and\n \nWhat about vaccinating boys?\n We do not yet know if the vaccine is effective in boys or men. It is possible that vaccinating males will have health benefits for them by preventing genital warts and rare cancers, such as penile and anal cancer. It is also possible that vaccinating boys/men will have indirect health benefits for girls/women. Studies are now being done to find out if the vaccine works to prevent HPV infection and disease in males. When more information is available, this vaccine may be licensed and recommended for boys/men as well. \n \n\n \n and\nStudies have found the vaccine to be almost 100% effective in preventing diseases caused by the four HPV types covered by the vaccine- including precancers of the cervix, vulva and vagina, and genital warts. The vaccine has mainly been studied in young women who had not been exposed to any of the four HPV types in the vaccine.\n \n The vaccine was less effective in young women who had already been exposed to one of the HPV types covered by the vaccine. \n \n This vaccine does not treat existing HPV infections, genital warts, precancers or cancers. \n \n \n\n \n So the long and the short of it is:\n \n Girls, because it is most effective for those who are not already sexually active.\n \n Not boys because it is not currently approved for them due to lack of study.\n \n The younger the better.\n \n You cherry picked information on the web and provided poor analysis to boot.\n \n Try again. I think you lose this time.\n \n Huck",

In no way does that show any potential long term affects during child-bearing years of these young girls. \n \n The vaccine will NOT wipe out cervical cancer, as it is only 70% effective at best for girls, and is not given to boys who are carriers of the virus. \n \n The marketing of the vaccine implies that we will wipe out cervical cancer if we force this on our young daughters, and that is simply not the case. The motivation for this, from everything that I have read, is purely for profits and votes.\n \n I will teach my daughter to get pap tests every year to catch and deal with any abnormalities early on. To me, this gives her a better shot at avoiding cervical cancer than a vaccine which only prevents 70% at best.\n\n \n You are entitled to your opinion. You still quoted out of context and did not give all the data and cherry picked to prove your point. This is pretty bad form.",

   "You are entitled to your opinion. You still quoted out of context and did not give all the data and cherry picked to prove your point. This is pretty bad form.\nI quoted what I thought was relevant, and I don't see where I quoted anything out of context - I quoted pieces which addressed specific aspects of this issue. The article is much too long to post in its entirety - that is why I provided the link. \n \n The fact that the FDA licensed the vaccine has nothing to do with forcing in on our pre-teen daughters, and the fact that the company which produces the vaccine recommends it for pre-teen girls does nothing to address the lack of testing for that age group, and I just don't see how they can claim it is 100% effective for certain types of HPV with the limited testing that they have done. \n \n Less than 1200 girls aged 9-15 were tested and followed for 18 months. How many of these girls became sexually active in that 18 month period? And active enough to become exposed to HPV? And how many of them have reached average child-bearing years to check for long term side effects? \n \n If you ask me, they have FAR from proven that this will prevent cancer in girls and TOTALLY NOT proven that it is safe for this age group. They just have no basis to force it on young girls - nothing that shouts out THIS WILL SAVE YOUR DAUGHTER. If people want to give it to their daughters, that is great for them. But don't tell me I have to give it to mine.",
