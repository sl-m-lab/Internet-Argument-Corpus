This is CIA provocation imo! USA is dreaming about unleashing civil war in Iraq. Look, it will be the beast reason for Iraq splitting into 6-7 sectors which will be turn into zone of responsibility when peacekeepers troops will come to Iraq. It's clear; USA understands that it's not enough power for Iraq controlling and that's why only UN and NATO troops will help Americans to keep control over Iraq.

   "And the war goes on and on and on.\n \n And, I'm borrowing some talking points from a couple of letters in today's New York Times but, \"the demise of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi is yet another feel-good moment in the war, like the toppling of the statue of Saddam Hussein, President Bush's \"Mission Accomplished\" speech in May 2003, the capture of Saddam Hussein, the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty, the first democratic elections in January 2005, and the agreement on a new constitution in October 2005.\n \n As the history of the war has shown, the emotions of these feel-good moments fade quickly, and we are forced to confront once again the cold reality of being stuck in an ineptly executed and protracted war based on false premises, with no postwar or exit strategy.\" John Chalmers of Portland.\n \n Then, \"Does the Bush administration honestly believe that displaying gigantic framed photographs of one bloodied, dead terrorist, while prohibiting the photographing of thousands of flag-draped coffins returning with our war dead, will confuse the American public as to the real outcome of this calamitous misstep in American policy?\" Charles Fowler of Exeter, New Hampshire.\n \n Well said, gentlemen.",

Bush had three very compelling chances to eliminate Mr. Z prior to this time. I'm quite surprised that he managed to actually off a relatively high-ranking member of Al-Qaeda if, indeed, that was Mr. Z's status, being the utter klutz that Bush is in warfare. It is quite difficult to find anything that Bush has done right in the occupation of Iraq.\n \n Please, God, don't let Bush start any more wars because he declares himself the \"Divine War President.\" He never listens to anyone who has ever been involved in warfare. He knows nothing of warfare. His only knowledge is of lining the well-padded pockets of his dear friends with American taxpayers' money.",
