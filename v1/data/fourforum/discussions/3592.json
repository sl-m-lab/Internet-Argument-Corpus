   "Hey, \n \n I was reading the Slant, Vanderbilt University's humorous student newspaper and I came across this article. I posted the web version. I think it's pretty good the way they reversed the roles. I doubt it, but maybe if some anti-gay folks were to reverse roles (put the shoe on the other foot) then they might be able to understand the other side a bit better. Again, I doubt it.\n \n http://www.theslant.net/index.php?page=story&story_id=3730&date=20041006\n \n \n 'Gay' Student Hides Girlfriend From Dads\n \n Mar 29, 2004\n \n Bruce Turner, a freshman from San Francisco, had a harrowing Parent's Weekend, being forced to rely on a long series of wacky misadventures in order to shield his relationship with fellow freshman Kathy Brice from his fathers as they came up to check on him.\n \n \"I'm just glad it's all finally over. This past weekend was almost as bad as the fathers-son events we go do back home,\" Said a visibly exhausted Turner, referring to the gay family events his parents take him to in order to bond and - they hope - introduce him to other attractive, upstanding ***** youths in the community.\n \n In order to convince his dads that he is gay, Bruce not only hid his relationship with his girlfriend from his dads over the weekend, but he also managed to talk friend Jake Armstead into pretending to be the \"special someone\" he'd told his parents about. \"At first I was kinda freaked out by the whole thing, but Bruce was so pleading and desperate that I eventually caved after he threw in a hundred bucks and promised we wouldn't have to do any gay ****.\"\n \n Despite the weeks of planning, the weekend did not go completely smoothly. Although Turner had done his best to remove all evidence of Brice's existence from his room, he was unable to fully hide all traces of her. \"Christ, when dad1 and dad2 found one of Kathy's bras under my bed I thought they were gonna freak. They got real silent for a second, but as I started to explain Steve suddenly broke out into the biggest smile and said 'Our little guy's playing dress-up!.' I've never been so relieved in my life.\"\n \n Turner feels torn between wanting to please his fathers by living up their expectations for him and wanting to live his own life, comfortable with being openly straight. \"One of my earliest memories is back when I was about four, and Carl caught me playing 'army men' with my Barbie dolls. I'll never forget that look of disappointment on his face,\" said Turner. \"God, don't even get me started on the time when I was thirteen and they found that Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition when they were dusting my room.\" Turner now regrets ever \"coming out\" five years ago to please his lesbian grandmother. \"I wanted to make Pawpaw happy before she passed away, and my dads couldn't have been prouder of me for making such a 'brave' decision. I can't bear to see the looks on their faces when I tell them I'm straight. I feel like I'll be such a failure in their eyes. Why can't they just accept me for the straight man I am?\"\n \n Although Bruce survived yet another weekend as a half-closeted heterosexual, he sees much larger battles on the horizon. \"When [fathers Steve and Carl] took Jake and me out to eat at Bread & Co. on Saturday, I thought we were pretty safe talking politics, until somehow the issue of gay marriage came up, then Steve started nudging me and winking. Now, I can pretend to have a boyfriend, but a ****ing husband? Not that I'm homophobic or anything, but if Bush actually gets this gay marriage ban passed it's going to be a huge load off my back.\"\n \n Turner's dads headed back to California completley clueless about their son's mainstream lifestyle. \"We were a little worried about sending our little princess off to Vanderbilt, because we weren't sure about the dangerous heterosexual influences there and the pressures that would be on him. But he's handled it really well. I'm so glad those confusing middle school years are behind him\" said Carl Turner.\n \n Steve Turner, however, left with some doubts. \"I'm a little worried about Jake, I don't know if he's right for [Bruce]. He doesn't seem completely comfortable with his sexuality. Hopefully we can get a better feel for him this summer when he comes to our annual Fire Island retreat.\"\n\n The software bleeped out the Q word and the F word.",
