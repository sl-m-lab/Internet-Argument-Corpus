In our legal system, the distinction is that with dire need, the prevented harm must be greater than the inflicted harm.\n \n As example, a starving man could not be punished for stealing food to prevent his own death, if he has not caused the starvation.\n \n \n \n Applying this to abortion is, of course a more complex issue. By the rule, no doctor could be prosecuted for aborting in case the pregnancy threatens the woman's life, for example.",

(Frankly one lacks the ability to intend anything until well after their first birthday.) But that does not mean a pregnancy can't be a threat and that ending it isn't a way to defend oneself against that threat.\n\n I agree that it would make no sense for a law to prevent you from defending yourself from someone who is about to do you major damage, even if he intends no harm. From web searching, I have seen some definitions of self-defense that include a requirement of intent, and others that don't. So, I am not sure of the legal structure.\n \n There are occasional examples in real life of people who can cause harm without intending to. An example I saw from a internet forum was of a man who was being shot at by a hunter who thought, from that far distance, that he was an aniimal. In those cases, one usually can resort to other methods to stop the harm being done. \n \n The case of self defense in abortion in unique for many reasons. First, one cannot exactly warn the fetus to tell it to stop harming you. There are very few options for stopping the threat to the woman's life or health other than abortion. Presumably, in threats that happen at a very late stage of pregnancy, premature birth or ceasarean section would be an option, but often times it is not (loss of blood would be much too risky). So, abortion is the only self-defense choice in many of these situations. Also, in barely any other situation I can think of (except for conjoined twins) is the other being imposing itself in on the life of another in so inextricable a way. \n \n Yes, the late-term potentially-mentally-existing fetus is innocent in that it intends no harm, but that does not mean that it will not cause harm. I think it should be the choice of the woman whether or not to sacrifice her life or major health for the fetus that she is already making the sacrifice in carrying. I can admire those who make major sacrifices of themselves for others, but I don't think that it should be made into law for them to do so.",

   "Jito, of course all of the reasons you mention are the staple excuses that are normally given. But since when are they the real reason that motivates the woman. Last night I got a call from a Political Surveyor who asked me multiple questions regarding this election cycle. One set of questions were about what issues were most important to me regarding the Presidential election. I said that all of them were valid and important issues that I cared about, about 8 in total. She responded that I was allowed to pick as many as 3 issues that I cared about but the program didn't allow for me to pick all of them.\n \n So it is with the questionnaires every woman who gets an abortion must fill out. They have questions about why they are seeking it but not one option is to prevent wide hips, sagging boobs, a ponch stomach or not ready to stop partying, drinking or drugging. Those options aren't even made available to choose as the real reasons why women abort their babies so in your World, they don't even exist. Talk about being told what you must think and buying it hook line and sinker. Get out of that box jito, it has to be awfully tight in there.\n\n \n Saying women get unwanted pregnancies from partying and drugging is like saying black people steal. Even though a large percentage of the prison population is black, it doesn't mean black people in general steal.\n \n That would be a malicious stereotype. Saying that women get unwanted pregnancies from partying and drugging, especially with absolutely no evidence, is stereotypical and sexist.",

   "Have you ever seen an abortion questionnaire sinjin? What I'm trying to show you is common sense, something the left is sorely lacking. It's like when lyte argued that statistically atheists make up less that 1% of our Prison population, and produced \"ACTUAL SO CALLED STATISTICS\", But ask yourself this just for the sake of common sense. How many benefits do atheists get in prison compared to men who want out of their cells for bible studies, church services and worship services. The Christians also have access to special programs that lead to early release and community service points that lead to early release.\n \n And as the coup de graux, how many convicts want to go before the parole board labeled as godless heathens who don't even believe in God? NONE OF THEM, THAT'S HOW MANY. So like typical atheists and the smart criminals they are, they lie like hell and call themselves christians who just made a mistake. Well, you can be sure that if we could get a thousand of these so called christians here for a Poll, they would relate a lot better with you atheists than they would with me.\n \n And so it is with the questionnaires of abortion clinics. The questions on it are designed to manipulate the outcome to appear as innocent and morally right as possible. But we all know that is a blatant lie. It's just that some prefer the lie to the truth which is why such distorted statistics exist in the first place.\n\n \n Again, assumptions, assumptions, assumptions.

Since you don't, I can only assume that you don't like the disinfecting sunlight of truth being shined on the pollution you post here.emoticon_smile\n\n \n Oh great, fall back on the old Leftist stand by, by wanting to prevent unneeded abortions we in fact want to control all women. And my all time favorite, if I hate abortions so much, how many children have i personally adopted? \n \n Why is defending the voiceless innocent who can't defend themselves against murderers who will gladly promote their infanticide while these same abortionists will protest en-masse to prevent the execution of a mass murderer wanting to control all women or all people in your opinion? Why isn't it exactly what it is in that we want to save perfectly healthy, innocent children who who are being carried by perfectly healthy women?\n \n And regarding adoptions, my own sister adopted 2 children, one Amerasian, and that was 21 years ago. But more recently than that young acquaintances have investigated adopting a white baby, because they are white and were told that if one came available at all, it would be at least 5 years before their name worked its way up on the list if they applied right then. And to allow 2 years for a minority child due to the length of the list.\n \n So I'll tell you what is a fact. If your pro-infanticide side would agree to support the banning of all abortions except for the real and true health of the mother, I could get 5 million names of people who would agree to adopt babies if there was an overflow of children after all of those who want to adopt get first dibs.\n \n And the QUOTE]/QUOTE] button is there for ease and clarity.

And if you'll notice the income level of those getting them, it is the higher income women who are getting the most abortions, so poverty isn't the reason for the majority of them. And besides, if you look at the number of teens getting abortions, that number correlates fine with the under 15,000 annual income level because most teenagers (20% statistic) don't even have jobs so of course they statistically would appear to be in poverty. But they aren't at all as they still live at home.\n \n You have accidently defeated yourself jito by actually posting an objective web site. One I didn't think even existed.

Being mentally and/or emotionally unprepared is a \"social reason\"? Being too poor to properly raise a child is a \"social reason\"?\n Out of curiosity, how many of those that actually are bona fide \"social reasons\" are only issues because of hatemongers and religious nutjobs who rail against abortion and lambaste those who simply want to have the best living situations for their families?\n \n I am also not surprised that even your \"objective\" site doesn't support your blustering about bars.

You see Capo, I was there and following the debates before it was even sent to the Supreme Court. I know that the pro abortionists cried and screamed only about the women whos health was threatened by pregnancy and that these women were further risking their lives by getting illegal and unsafe abortion. They also made a huge issue about incest which was almost completely unknown except in families like yours and in the Ozarks, and concerning rape. \n \n Most Americans understood those reasons as valid which brings me back to my original statement which you attacked, which is if abortion remained only and staunchly for the reasons originally stated when it was legalized, then people like me wouldn't be so adamently against the wholesale murder that is taking place in my Country each year. The death of 2 million innocent babies each and every year obviously doesn't bother you, but it does bother me.

I've seen ads for a number of religious organizations (that are presumably pro-life) asking to support a fund for such unfortunate children. However, as we've seen in the past, how much of that money actually goes toward helping those children is substantially less impressive.\n \n What I find reprehensible is that we have these people thumping their Bibles and squealing of righteousness but who would rather donate large sums of money to have a ridiculously swanky and over-the-top place that's empty for all but three hours of the week where they can get together and pat themselves on the back for their righteousness... instead of doing something productive with their money.\n \n I've said it for years, and I'll say it again here: Imagine if all of the money that goes into obligatory Christmas gifts, cards, and decorations, into donations to the already disgustingly and wastefully wealthy faux-charity organizations, and into contributions to unneeded, egotistical projects went toward things like helping the hungry or the homeless, or promoting education.\n \n A scenario I like to use in my class is: if people would just educate themselves about things like basic physics and general biology, then the frauds and quacks that make their livings by hackery (like the \"free energy\" proponents and Kevin Trudeau) wouldn't be getting enough money to continue their bullspitting campaigns that work to get even more of your money.",

I mean, since your earliest memories haven't you watched yourself grow from one stage of development to another? Didn't you go from being a toddler to an adolescent? And from an adolescent to a teen? And on and on? \n \n Did you just go to sleep one night and wake up the next morning in a different stage of life? I think not. You grew and developed and went from stage to stage. So how can you treat the development an unborn child goes from conception to birth is any different a growth and development process than any other stage of growth we experience in life? It makes no sense at all shooter.\n \n Now regarding this charitable giving; talk about a sweeping generalization designed to condemn a whole segment of Society! How unfair and inaccurate you are to boot. Here is some evidence that proves that conservatives out give liberals on all counts with pretty conclusive and sweeping evidence. \n \n http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2682730\n Sioux Falls vs. San Francisco\n We assume the rich give more than the middle class, the middle class more than the poor. I've heard liberals care more about the less fortunate, so we assume they give more than conservatives do. Are these assumptions truth, or myth?\n \n To test what types of people give more, \"20/20\" went to two very different parts of the country, with contrasting populations: Sioux Falls, S.D. and San Francisco, Calif. The Salvation Army set up buckets at the busiest locations in each city -- Macy's in San Francisco and Wal-Mart in Sioux Falls. Which bucket collected more money?\n \n Sioux Falls is rural and religious; half of the population goes to church every week. People in San Francisco make much more money, are predominantly liberal, and just 14 percent of people in San Francisco attend church every week. Liberals are said to care more about helping the poor; so did people in San Francisco give more?\n \n It turns out that this idea that liberals give more...is a myth. Of the top 25 states where people give an above average percent of their income, 24 were red states in the last presidential election.\n And here are some other links, this one below by a liberal who hated to reveal his findings about who gives more in reality.\n \n http://www.beliefnet.com/story/204/story_20419_1.html\n \n http://www.blogsofwar.com/2006/11/17/conservatives-give-more-to-charity/",

Some children are able to swallow, eat, cry, hear, feel vibrations (loud sounds), react to touch and even to light.

The fact that anencephalic children (sometimes) aren't treated like tumors is not an indicator that they are sentient. (Fetuses with genetic or developmental defects are often aborted.) Seriously, you need to look up what sentient means if you're going to keep using the word.\n 8) Stop relying on lies, frauds and hoaxes [and fallacies]\n But the examples in your second citation did have brains, so you cannot reasonably use them as as examples of children with no brains.

   "An excellent question to consider Ao; I believe that life begins at conception, so yes, the soul is present long before self awareness is. Here is evidence that brain activity in fetuses is measurable and testable.\n \n http://www.uams.edu/today/2002/090602/fetal.htm\n \n And this value distinction plays out in life also as coma victims that show measurable brain activity are kept alive long enough for the body to heal and repair itself. They aren't just disconnected as if they are no longer alive.\n\n It is only higher brain activity that shows the potential presence of sentience or a mind, as we understand it. Early fetuses and many coma patients do not show any of the higher brain activity. To clarify this point, I would compare it to a hypothetical computer where one has powered up all the transistors but one has not connected them sufficiently yet to have any real function. Without sufficient electrical connections, that computer may be \"on\" but it is not yet functioning - so measurements would show electrical activity but that electrical activity would not necessarily show actual function. The same goes for the higher level aspects of the brain. The brain develops in stages and neurologists agree that any higher brain function (outside of the basic functioning of the body - controlling heart beat, lung function, etc.) needs the type of neural connections that happen fairly late in the pregnancy in the section of the brain that deals with those higher brain functions. Unless one believes in the presence of a sentient soul, this means that the fetus cannot be sentient or have any level of mind until those later brain developments happen.\n \n I admit that I do find the concept of the soul appealing and haven't completely given up on it. However, I, personally, can have no confidence in an existence of a soul without evidence and the opposing evidence (where so much of our mental function and personality has been attributed to the physical brain) makes it hard to justify many claims one would like to make about the soul. Also, even if I allowed myself the belief in a soul, I would think it a cruel fate for a sentient soul to exist in such an underdeveloped body - something I would not attribute to a hypothetical benevolent God. \n \nWe have learned so much about basic human biology today that it is completely hypocritical for the pro abortionist to then deny that a fetus is alive and anything less than a developing full and complete human being from conception. The moment the egg is fertilized, life is then present and the child is then growing into a unique individual with all of the potential of everyone who will ever read this post. \n \n After all, at one time in each of our very lives, we were all in exactly the same place as that fetus we are now discussing. Talk about irrational hubris and arrogance that it takes to deny that fetus the same respect that we demand for ourselves as sentient beings when we know beyond any doubt at all that we started out exactly as they are now.\n\n I presume that the pro-life definition of the beginnings of life, if one defines it more exactly, would be defined as the first point at which a genetically unique life form exists that, if left to natural processes, will become someone like you and me. Given that definition, I doubt many pro-choice proponents would deny that. However, often, pro-life proponents treat those beginnings of life as a magical event in which something (a person) arises from nothing and they don't analyze in detail what actually happens. The question I so often ask pro-life proponents is: What are the key differences between a newly fertilized zygote and an unfertilized egg? The egg is, after all, alive. However:\n 1) The egg will never grow into you and me (people) without the critical step of fertilization, so it has a far smaller chance of becoming a persom. A zygote, however, has a much greater chance of eventually becoming a full person. It's potential is much larger.\n 2) The egg only has half the DNA.\n 3) If one believes in a soul entering at conception, then one could claim that sentience or a sense of mind exists in the zygote, where it does not exist in the egg.\n \n I suspect that it is the first point and the third point that are most critical for you - i.e. its potential, and a belief that something more than merely biological happens at fertilization that makes that zygote special whether or not it has the chance to grow into a full person. \n \n I think that the anger accompanying so many of the discussions / arguements about abortion does prevent many pro-choice proponents from expressing that many also value the potential of the zygote to become more. I, personally, do value that potential and agree that it is not the same as a non-sentient piece of flesh, mainly because of this potential. However, potential is not the only thing that one can value in contemplating the beginnings of an unwanted pregnancy. I know that you don't place much value in the rights of a woman to her own body, but those of us on the pro-choice side most definitely do, and that value outweighs the value we place on the potential of the zygote. After all, a zygote having potential of becoming like you and me is not the same as it being you and me. For many of us, it is the onset of sentience or some rudimentary sense of mind that determines the point where their value outweighs the value we place on a woman's right to her own body. \n \nI do deny that the brain has anything to do with our sentience as human beings. The brain is necessary to determine the quality of the lives we live in this body, but not that we are alive. For example, children are born with partial brains, or even no brains at all. The family might decide that no extraordinary efforts be made to keep such a baby alive, but if the baby survives once disconnected from life support, Neither the parents nor the hospital have the right to just kill it. \n \n That is evidence that according to our moral and ethical laws, life is not determined by ones ability to think.\n\n I don't think that anyone denies that the zygote is alive. However, most of us would deny that it being alive means that it is sentient or has any mind. There is no biological reason to think that a zygote would have sentience or a mind. The only way one could believe that life means sentience is if one assumed a supernatural component to life beginning at the zygote stage - i.e. a soul.",

My only reason for originally posting info on children born without brains was to show how they were treated by the medical professionals who had to care for them based on the legal and social norms we live by in this Society. I showed that we don't just dispose of brain dead people as we dispose of tumors. That we treat them with respect and don't kill them but allow them to die a natural death. \n \n In response, electrlyte posted a story how an anencephalic child born in a Country I have never even heard of paraded one down the street as if that proves something about how our Society treats them.\n \n \n \nI admit that I do find the concept of the soul appealing and haven't completely given up on it.

My problem here is that for every point i make that proves the unborn are miniatures of us, someone changes the boundaries of the debate and attempts to redefine the arguments being made.\n \n \nI presume that the pro-life definition of the beginnings of life, if one defines it more exactly, would be defined as the first point at which a genetically unique life form exists that, if left to natural processes, will become someone like you and me.\n \n \n Yes, and to be clear; I am saying that takes place at conception. At that moment life is present and the growth process has begun.\n \n \nGiven that definition, I doubt many pro-choice proponents would deny that.

The question I so often ask pro-life proponents is: What are the key differences between a newly fertilized zygote and an unfertilized egg? The egg is, after all, alive. However:\n\n \n Actually, in most debates, it's your side that speaks to a magical event when life begins. It is they who insist that a second trimester fetus is NOT ALIVE, yet a third trimester fetus is miraculously some how all of a sudden ALIVE. That argument is ridiculous.\n \n \n1) The egg will never grow into you and me (people) without the critical step of fertilization, so it has a far smaller chance of becoming a persom. A zygote, however, has a much greater chance of eventually becoming a full person. It's potential is much larger.\n 2) The egg only has half the DNA.\n\n \n Correct. I have never claimed that the egg or the sperm by itself is a living being. It is only a fertilized egg that grows into a person, so that is the only subject I am discussing here. I am clearly saying that a child in the womb that is developing normally has every potential to become what we are and that is a life worth protecting. It is in no way a non living person. And because it has been shown that 25 and 30 week old fetuses have brain activity then they have proven their human potential, and that if allowed to grow to term they will inevitably be just like you and me.\n \n \n3) If one believes in a soul entering at conception, then one could claim that sentience or a sense of mind exists in the zygote, where it does not exist in the egg.\n\n \n I would agree with this statement. If left alone, will the unfertilized egg grow in the womb and become a life? or will it get washed away with the next menstrual cycle? So you see, that question takes care of itself as the egg by itself, never grows into a living being.\n \n \nI think that the anger accompanying so many of the discussions / arguements about abortion does prevent many pro-choice proponents from expressing that many also value the potential of the zygote to become more. I, personally, do value that potential and agree that it is not the same as a non-sentient piece of flesh, mainly because of this potential.

I know that you don't place much value in the rights of a woman to her own body, but those of us on the pro-choice side most definitely do, and that value outweighs the value we place on the potential of the zygote.

For many of us, it is the onset of sentience or some rudimentary sense of mind that determines the point where their value outweighs the value we place on a woman's right to her own body.\n \n \n This paragraph may very well define the crux of the issue separating our two sides from every being able to compromise a solution. The pro-choice side gives credence to the mother's rights as supreme at the baby's expense. The pro-lifers believe that the mother made her choice as an adult by being irresponsible and that the innocent child shouldn't be made to pay for her irresponsibility with his life. I have always said that in the cases of moms health, rape or incest, a choice to abort needs to be available to the mother. But I reject abortion as a form of birth control which makes up the vast majority of them per year in America.\n \n \nI don't think that anyone denies that the zygote is alive. However, most of us would deny that it being alive means that it is sentient or has any mind. There is no biological reason to think that a zygote would have sentience or a mind. The only way one could believe that life means sentience is if one assumed a supernatural component to life beginning at the zygote stage - i.e. a soul.\n\n \n You see I disagree with this summary of what defines a fetus as sentient. If we accept your definition of sentient, it could successfully be argued that if I chose to kill anyone I wanted to kill while they were in REM SLEEP, then it isn't murder because they are unconscious, unaware of their surroundings and lacking an reason or common sense because they have no mind to speak of at all at that time. Of course you would argue that all we must do is wake them up to make them sentient, right? \n \n Well, my argument is that all we must do is allow that fetus to grow to term uninterrupted and he too will be sentient. How can we not respect the human dignity and potential of our most helpless and defenseless demographic simply because they are unable to speak for themselves, and choose in favor of the women who are the reason this so called problem exists in the first place. \n \n Shouldn't the culpable party be given the most responsibility for correcting the problem they caused by their own actions? Why should the new life be sacrificed when its potential is equal to that of every other human being who is allowed to live?",

When posts are written with anger or frustration, on either side of the political spectrum, then it is hard to get a real dialogue going, so I tend to skip the angry or frustrated posts. \n \nRemember that the link I posted in making the point I did regarding the soul and sentience of the child was the link that showed normally developing fetuses that show brain functions and activity that directly refutes the pro-abortionists claims that the unborn children who face abortion are not like us in that they have no brain functions nor can they feel pain. My problem here is that for every point i make that proves the unborn are miniatures of us, someone changes the boundaries of the debate and attempts to redefine the arguments being made.\n\n The fetuses whose brain patterns were measured in that article had gestational ages of 28-36 weeks. That is the end of second trimester / beginning of third trimester. Indeed, I have posted links myself in the past the show that the brain starts getting sufficiently capable of potential mind / sentience at roughly the beginning of the third trimester. As I have mentioned in numerous posts within this forum, I personally would start valuing the fetus's rights over the rights of the woman to her body once the fetus gains the capabilities of having some level of mind - roughly around the beginning of that third trimester - and would therefore place restrictions on third trimester abortions. \n \n We, on the pro-choice side, are a diverse lot. It is only the minority of pro-choice supporters who would give strong value to the fetus only at birth and give absolute priority to a woman's right over her body at all stages. To support this claim, I would quote a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll done in 2003 (the only one I found addressing trimesters, from http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm ) that found that 83% of Americans would generally keep abortion illegal (minus the usual exceptions) in the third trimester of pregnancy. That number tells us that the majority of pro-choice supporters would also strongly restrict third trimester abortions.\n \nActually, in most debates, it's your side that speaks to a magical event when life begins. It is they who insist that a second trimester fetus is NOT ALIVE, yet a third trimester fetus is miraculously some how all of a sudden ALIVE. That argument is ridiculous.\n\n I would agree that if anyone claimed that the second trimester fetus is not alive, then that would be a foolish arguement. However, I haven't personally read any posts by pro-choice proponents that claim that life itself begins at the third trimester. Many, such as myself, would claim that the living being doesn't become a person, whose value might outweight the mothers right to her body, until roughly that third trimester since it is not life alone that we value but some level of mind in that living body - the idea that there is \"someone home\" in the body. \n \nCorrect. I have never claimed that the egg or the sperm by itself is a living being. It is only a fertilized egg that grows into a person, so that is the only subject I am discussing here. I am clearly saying that a child in the womb that is developing normally has every potential to become what we are and that is a life worth protecting. It is in no way a non living person. And because it has been shown that 25 and 30 week old fetuses have brain activity then they have proven their human potential, and that if allowed to grow to term they will inevitably be just like you and me.\n\n Where the roughly 30 week old fetus is concerned, I generally give it the benefit of the doubt and assume that if it could at that point theoretically have some rudimentary mind then it actually does. It is that beginning of a mental self that I find most important in determining the balance of rights (fetus vs mother) in the abortion debate. Prior to the start of a mental existence, it is difficult to call the fetus \"innocent\" or have sympathy with what it is at that point in time since, at that time, it is just a body with \"nobody home\". I can understand that, since you believe in a soul, you would view that there actually IS \"someone home\" at that early stage but you must understand that most of us do not believe in a soul that enters at comception. Essentially, if you take away a soul from a zygote then what is it? It is just a cell at that moment with its worth lying purely in its potential to become more. \n \nThis paragraph may very well define the crux of the issue separating our two sides from every being able to compromise a solution. The pro-choice side gives credence to the mother's rights as supreme at the baby's expense. The pro-lifers believe that the mother made her choice as an adult by being irresponsible and that the innocent child shouldn't be made to pay for her irresponsibility with his life. I have always said that in the cases of moms health, rape or incest, a choice to abort needs to be available to the mother. But I reject abortion as a form of birth control which makes up the vast majority of them per year in America.\n\n There are a wide range of reasons why women find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy. For many, the birth control that they did use simply did not work. For others, they were being irresponsible in not using birth control at all and they deserve to be criticized for their irresponsibility. However, I think that many on the pro-life side think that agreeing to sex in itself is a binding moral contract that obliges a woman to carry any potential child. I would disagree with that view. People need to be wary of the potential risks of sex - including both pregnancies and STDs - and be prepared to face the consequences if anything unwanted does happen. \n \n Where pregnancy is concerned, those options currently include carrying the baby to term and keeping it or giving it up for adoption, or abortion. The decision on whether or not to have an abortion is one that is weighed by pros and cons. It is very difficult for many women to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term. Outside of the physical demands, it is tremendously difficult to keep a child that one is either emotionally or financially unprepared to support, while society is not particularly supportive of women who choose to give up their child. There continues to be some stigma against women who give up their children for adoption. Where abortion is concerned, for those that do not believe that a soul enters at conception, the main arguement against abortion at early stages of pregnancy is that it ends a life that had potential to become a person (like you and me). That moral weight of ending a potential often is not strong enough to counter all the arguements of how carrying the fetus to term would ruin many aspects of the mothers life. I can understand that, if you believe in a soul, then it is not only potential that one denies to a not-yet-existing person, but that you would actually think that an actual person ALREADY exists - sentience and all - that one is killing. However, you must remember that, without that belief in a soul in the early fetus, pro-choice supporters do not share your view that a person already exists - it is just a body with potential that they are aborting, not a person. The perspective is entirely different.\n \nYou see I disagree with this summary of what defines a fetus as sentient. If we accept your definition of sentient, it could successfully be argued that if I chose to kill anyone I wanted to kill while they were in REM SLEEP, then it isn't murder because they are unconscious, unaware of their surroundings and lacking an reason or common sense because they have no mind to speak of at all at that time. Of course you would argue that all we must do is wake them up to make them sentient, right? \n \n Well, my argument is that all we must do is allow that fetus to grow to term uninterrupted and he too will be sentient. How can we not respect the human dignity and potential of our most helpless and defenseless demographic simply because they are unable to speak for themselves, and choose in favor of the women who are the reason this so called problem exists in the first place. \n\n By sentience or mind, I do not mean the level of sentience that we have when we are awake. I just mean some rudimentary semblance of mind. Our minds do not completely turn off when we are asleep - after all, our dreams can be quite animated. Also, some level of mind still exists even in deep levels of coma. Just because someone cannot communicate does not mean that they do not have a mind. Late term fetuses most likely have some level of mind (based on the fact that their brains seem to be capable of such mental existence). Therefore, I take the view that, in their essence, they are not all that different than you or I. The key criteria is a mental existence. Without a mental existence, we are just bodies. Take away my mental existence, and I would no longer exist as a person. \n \n If a loved one suffered such a terrible accident that they would have no higher level mental function left (outside of brain maintaining their heart rate, etc.) but their body was kept alive without that mental function, then I would have no other choice but to accept the fact that they are gone. It would be very hard to agree to \"pull the plug\" since that living body would remind me of the person who is gone, and since grief would probably have me hold on to irrational hope. However, the raw truth would be that the loved one would gone in all ways that matter. Similarly, even though a body has already started to develop, a new person does not come into being until he/she does so mentally. Where I and others might attribute it to various states of the brain, you might attribute it to a soul entering or leaving a body, but the concept is the same.",

   "The fetuses whose brain patterns were measured in that article had gestational ages of 28-36 weeks. That is the end of second trimester / beginning of third trimester. Indeed, I have posted links myself in the past the show that the brain starts getting sufficiently capable of potential mind / sentience at roughly the beginning of the third trimester. As I have mentioned in numerous posts within this forum, I personally would start valuing the fetus's rights over the rights of the woman to her body once the fetus gains the capabilities of having some level of mind - roughly around the beginning of that third trimester - and would therefore place restrictions on third trimester abortions. \n \n\n \n Hi Ao, let me try to explain the inconsistency in what I see as the prochoicers attitude regarding this third trimester acceptance of a fetus value while continuing to deny the inherent value of first and second trimester babies, especially today. I'm sure that you are as aware as I am of the blood tests and fetal monitoring tests that Dr's perform on pregnant women that allow them to determine very early on that the baby being carried is healthy or not. \n \n They are able to determine abnormalities, birth defects and diseases that aren't physically evident at all. So when a baby gets a clean bill of health at as young as 8 to 12 weeks into the pregnancy it is well known at that time that this woman is carrying a healthy viable child. So how is it that we can treat the young fetus as if it is nothing more than a tumor to be removed and discarded prior to the 3rd trimester when as intelligent people who have seen billions of birthing experiences in reality, we know all too well that the outcome of this childs gestation period will end in a beautiful new born child if left to grow to term. \n \n Yet somehow some are able to rationalize that only once the brain waves can be measured does that qualify the child as being worthy of being afforded rights. For me personally, I know that from the very first discovery that my wife was pregnant did I worry about the welfare and health of my unborn daughters. The thought never entered my mind that they weren't worth worrying about until a test could be performed that proved they had testable brain activity.",

Namely, it is not as much what the zygote is AT THAT MOMENT that matters as much as what it will become - a person like you and me. As I mentioned before, I and many other pro-choice propents do value that potential (and I wish that more pro-choice proponents here would admit to it), but not as much as we value the right of the mother to her own body.

If a zygote was conceived without a spiritual soul and the mother's body for whatever reason somehow biologically kept the zygote from growing - so it would remain forever a zygote (or even first trimester fetus for that matter) with no potential of becoming more - would you still value its life over the rights of the mother to her body? If so, then what in that non-developing soul-less zygote or early fetus is it that you would be valuing so much?

This is a proven reality so to place more emphasis on the woman's right to kill her own offspring when it was her irresponsible action that caused the problem. It defies logic that the innocent party can be killed by the party that created the problem in the first place. Where is your sense of justice?\n\n We both agree that the zygote or early fetus will very likely grow into a full person if not prevented from growing. The main difference in our outlook is how we look at what the zygote or early fetus is AT THAT MOMENT, not counting potential for what it will become in the future. I suspect that your belief in a soul residing in the zygote or early fetus makes you automatically attach certain aspects to it without even realising that it is because of the belief in that soul that you attach those aspects. The main aspect is the idea that there is \"somebody home\" in that zygote or early embryo - that it is not just a body, but an early version of a person in there. I think that that is the reason that you use words such as \"innocent\" and \"justice\". Again, you must remember that, for those of us who do not share your belief in a soul residing in the early fetus, it is really just a body at that stage so that the ONLY thing it has going for it is what it will become in the future, not what it is at that point in time. That is a very big difference in outlook. \n \n Presumably, you might think that there is some sense of suffering, fear or loss that the fetus itself might feel if it is aborted and I would think that any such thoughts would have to stem from religious belief in a soul. If the early fetus would have no soul, then you might also agree that, at that early point in time, the biology is not yet ready for it to have any mental existence - no suffering, no fear, no pain, no emotions or thoughts of any kind whatsoever, conscious or subconscious. Without that mental existence, concepts such as \"innocence\" or \"justice\" just cannot apply. \n \n I was trying to think up an analogy for you so that you can understand the point of view but I suspect that, if I presented an analogy of a zygote conceived without a soul, then you might think that it never will achieve sentience - that a soul is necessary for sentience. However, imagine a soul that itself spiritually develops - starting off as only a spark of energy that accompanies life, and only later on gaining some sense of sentience or mind of any kind, conscious or subconscious. In that scenario, you might also agree that the early fetus without any sentience or mind cannot suffer, fear, have any emotions or thoughts or mind of any kind so it can neither be guilty nor innocent, or have any sense of injustice until it gains that sentience. That is equivalent to where we stand in our view. \n \nThis unfertilized egg argument is a red herring Ao, I personally have never even thought about eggs that aren't fertilized being potential people, and don't consider them anything more than what a woman washes out with her menstrual cycle. Life is life, and that occurs when the egg becomes fertilized. At that point it starts to grow into what we are now. It is at a stage that we can both relate to as we ourselves were there once.

That is both denial of reality and hypocrisy at the highest levels. Not to mention hubris and arrogance when we ourselves would deny the same rights to life that we are currently very thankful were afforded to us.\n\n I personally don't view myself as having existed as a person - as \"me\" - until I did so mentally. Before that, there was just a living body with \"nobody home\". It is those first sparks of mentality that determined my beginnings as a person. If, for whatever reason, the progress of my developing body would have been halted at the first trimester, then nothing would have been lost since \"I\" as a person would never have existed. Then, it wouldn't have mattered much to me if I had been aborted at the first trimester or if I had never been conceived - either way \"I\" would never have come into existence. It comes down to the basic idea that I believe that our mental selves are the very core of what makes us exist as people. Every step (from development of the egg, to fertilization of the egg, to carrying to term of the fetus) that comes before the development of mental existence is an important step for my existence to happen - I cannot have discounted any of the steps as necessary for that potential \"me\". \n \nRegarding the bolded: I think you have just described a form of cancer. It has no soul, it will never mature into a baby but will remain within her as a non developing soulless zygote?

Either way it isn't a child which possesses the characteristics of its parents.\n\n So, this establishes that it is indeed a combination of soul and potential that you most value. I think the thing that is most blocking our mutual understanding are the beliefs that automatically get attached to a belief in the soul. I think that your belief in a soul is the equivalent to my stress of a mental existence. How would you view the situation, I would ask, if you were assured that the soul did not enter until the beginning of the third trimester?\n \nSo to summarize, let's not complicate it. A healthy first trimester fetus has the same exact potential as a healthy third trimester fetus which has the same potential as a healthy infant which has the same potential as a toddler, and so on and so forth. The only thing they all need is the opportunity to reach independent life. And that means respecting their right to life from conception onward through the complete gestation period..\n\n In many of our views, the first trimester fetus may have the same potential for becoming a born walking talking person as the third trimester fetus, but the critical difference for me at least is that the thid trimester fetus is already similar enough to us to be called us - a person in the most critical sense. The key ingredient is the beginnings of the mind. Since you view some sense of mind as entering with the soul, you might not think that much happens at the beginning of that third trimester. However, not believing in a soul entering at conception, most of us DO INDEED believe that a very critical thing happens around the beginning of the third trimester - a mental existence begins in the fetus. That is a very important difference in our outlook.",

   "We both agree that the zygote or early fetus will very likely grow into a full person if not prevented from growing. The main difference in our outlook is how we look at what the zygote or early fetus is AT THAT MOMENT, not counting potential for what it will become in the future. I suspect that your belief in a soul residing in the zygote or early fetus makes you automatically attach certain aspects to it without even realising that it is because of the belief in that soul that you attach those aspects. The main aspect is the idea that there is \"somebody home\" in that zygote or early embryo - that it is not just a body, but an early version of a person in there. I think that that is the reason that you use words such as \"innocent\" and \"justice\". Again, you must remember that, for those of us who do not share your belief in a soul residing in the early fetus, it is really just a body at that stage so that the ONLY thing it has going for it is what it will become in the future, not what it is at that point in time. That is a very big difference in outlook.\n \n \n Hi Ao, ok, let's look at this from a purely natural perspective, shall we? Let's take the secular view of life and forget the soul for a moment. Now look in the mirror at who you are, at your intelligence, your sensitivity and the love you feel. All of the attributes that make you special, unique and very valuable as a human being. Now consider that every healthy zygote/fetus in its early stages of development has every bit the same potential as you do, and your evidence of that is the absolute knowledge within your own mind that you, at one time in your own development, you were exactly where they are now. \n \n We don't have to even consider this from a religious perspective or from the vantage point of a soul existing in order to perfectly relate to each and every one of these aborted infants being cut off from life at a stage of development that is precisely where we once were ourselves. And that is whether we believe in the soul or not. \n \n \nPresumably, you might think that there is some sense of suffering, fear or loss that the fetus itself might feel if it is aborted and I would think that any such thoughts would have to stem from religious belief in a soul. If the early fetus would have no soul, then you might also agree that, at that early point in time, the biology is not yet ready for it to have any mental existence - no suffering, no fear, no pain, no emotions or thoughts of any kind whatsoever, conscious or subconscious. Without that mental existence, concepts such as \"innocence\" or \"justice\" just cannot apply.\n\n \n I disagree that my belief that fetuses feel pain is based on religious beliefs, but rather, I submit to you that it is based on common sense as a natural progression in my insistence that the unborn are miniatures of you and me.

It is not much different than trying to relate to an unfertilized egg. Your contention is that fetuses are just miniature versions of ourselves. I might agree with you in the essentials for late term fetuses - since they have the brain development that allows for that essential criteria of mental existence - but would disagree with you when it comes to early fetuses. The brain in just not developed enough to allow for that mental existence. A religious world view may support it but science just does not support it. \n \n There is some uncertainty in that line of when the higher order mental processes could start in the brain - where some studies suggest that it can happen a few weeks prior to the beginning of the third trimester. That is why I mostly try to refer to that point as \"around\" the beginning of the third trimester. I would agree with a point that Steeeeve once brought up that trimesters are too large a unit of measurement to use and that weeks would be better. Once discussions and investigations finalize some consensus among neurologists in their understanding of brain development and when such higher order processes can start, then one could set a dividing line in weeks, after which there is too much of a chance of mental existence to allow unrestricted abortion. Either way, there is no scientific support fot the idea that any such mental existence, pain, etc. can happen in the first trimester - where the great majority of abortions occur. Are you claiming that a first trimester embryo/fetus can suffer, feel pain, emotions, etc. - for reasons other than a belief in a spiritual soul?\n \nI disagree that my belief that fetuses feel pain is based on religious beliefs, but rather, I submit to you that it is based on common sense as a natural progression in my insistence that the unborn are miniatures of you and me.

Even so, neurological studies that I have read summaries of say that early fetuses can experience reflex actions that may look to us like pain but are really just the body's automatic reaction to a stimulus (as disected frogs still might show that stimulus response) but do not reflect that the brain itself is registering that pain. I suspect that the earliest of those fetuses in the study you posted (ex. the 20 week-old fetuses as opposed to the 30 week fetuses) are showing just such reflex response. Unfortunately, you article did not mention whether or not this question was addressed and answered. \n \nWhat is interesting Ao, is that your beliefs are unique to this time in history because you are enlightened enough through technology to know with absolute certainty what the differences between a first and third trimester fetus looks like, even though you are a layman with no medical background, (an assumption on my part). \n \n What is relevant about that though is that you are determining, or allowing others to determine for you the value of an unborn child based totally on its perceived development without knowing for certain, because you have admitted you don't know for certain, what the spiritual ramifications are for our assumptions upon which we are basing our justifications for abortions on. My belief is that we should err on the side of caution if we truly can't answer all of these very valid questions that you have admitted exist, and raised in this debate.\n\n Yes, I cannot say with absolute certainty that there is no soul in a zygote, but I can be equally uncertain that there is no soul in an unfertilized egg, etc. If one takes a belief in a soul into account, which shows no evidence of its existence, then the point at which one can claim that it enters the body can be completely arbitrary. Even the traditional views of Christiantiy, as to when that soul entered the body, varied widely through history - where for much of history, it was viewed to enter the body at \"quickening\" (relatively late in the pregnancy). The idea that the soul enters the body at conception is a relatively recent belief within the Christian tradition. So, even the Church was not clear about this point. Given that uncertainty and the lack of evidence either way of whether or not a soul even exists, I follow the evidence presented by science - evidence that is repeatable and which can be explored in more and more detail.",

It makes no sense to me and the wrong party is being punished. And they are paying with their lives at the tune of 1.2 MILLION infants per year.\n\n I guess that a large part of this is that I don't view the early trimester fetus as \"us\" in the same sense as neither of us view the unfertilized egg as \"us\". Just because something will become a being we can sympathize with doesn't mean that it is that being AT THIS MOMENT. I just don't understand what it is about the fertilized egg/zygote that you sympathize with. You have no sympathy with the unfertilized egg even though we all also started from unfertilized eggs, yet you have sympathy for the fertilized egg. So, something happened during that process of fertilization that suddenly adds sympathy in your eyes. That is what I don't understand. I can understand that, if you believe in the soul, then you would believe that the fertilized egg has some mental sense of \"us\" in it, but you claim that you would hold this sympathy whether or not a soul would enter the zygote at conception.\n \n I guess I just don't see how one can sympathize with something that has no mental existence unless one is artificially attaching a mental existence where there is none. Yes, it will, in the future, gain a mental existence with which one can sympathize but, up to that point, it is just a mindless body - not a being I can sympathize with. I make a clear distinction between what it currently IS and what it WILL BE, perhaps you don't.\n \n Also, I will again mention the point that, for me, it would not have mattered if I had been aborted in the first trimester or whether I had never been conceived - the consequences would have been identical. Since I view mental existence as the core of our existence as people, \"I\" would never have existed either way. I owe my existence not only to the fact that my mother's pregnancy was carried to term, but also to the fact that I was conceived, that my parents even met, etc. I am certainly happy that nothing happened to stop that process but it really wouldn't have mattered at which stage of pregnancy or conception that process was stopped. I would not have experienced any difference since ther was no \"I\" to suffer any consequences before around the beginning of the third trimester.\n \n What difference would it have made to you if you had never been conceived vs. if you had been aborted in the first trimester?",

To quote Billy Joel \"the good old days weren't always good and tomorrow isn't as bad as it seems.\"\n \n \nhow many unwanted pregnancies occurred in America each year? \n\n \n More than you realize I'd bet. It was just a dirty little secret then. (can anyone say unhealthy, puritanical attitude towards sex/pregnancy?).\n \n \nI remember being a teenager and actually being embarrassed when I saw a woman's cleavage. \n\n \n Why? This is the unhealthy hang-up I am talking about. They are BOOBS. There is nothing wrong with them and its completely natural to like them. \n \n \nWomen used to cover their bodies when they left their homes and only street walkers dressed in super tight clothing that accentuated every curve and feature of their form. Today, it is the norm. \n\n \n There was all kind of sexy going on in the 50s - the styles were just different. Marilyn Monroe is still the most revered pin-up girl of all time. How about Bettie Page? Pedal pushers? Tight sweaters? \n \n \nIt is another example of women having it both ways again. They can flaunt themselves and seduce men with their bodies, but then when they get pregnant they can either throw the child away, or if the man has deep pockets they can keep the baby and use it as a meal ticket to hijack a man monetarily. \n\n \n WHOAH! Now I KNOW you are a misogynist. This really doesn't warrant any more repsect than when Siggy gets on the board and talks about the inferiority of blacks or how the Holocaust didn't happen. Straight up pathetic. Do your daughters know that you find women to be predatory and unable to make a decent living for themselves?\n \n \nSo my point is that if you really support measures to reduce unwanted pregnancies, then don't forsake that which used to work. \n\n \n As long as people have sex there will be unwanted pregnancy. It happens to single people, coupled people, and married people. And its not new.\n \n In previous posts to you I told what things I believe will work and backed those things up with stats and evidence. You have not done this - you have just spun a wildly innacurate fairy tale about the 50s.\n \n \nMODESTY \n\n \n This will not make a difference. I wear low-cut tops and glitter out to the bar all the time. I never take trash home (or go home with it). The girl next to me could wear a ankle-length skirt and turtle neck and be nailing everything that moves. \n \n \nAND SELF RESPECT OF ONES BODY AND SEXUAL OPENNESS.\n\n \n Change \"sexual openess\" to \"sexuality\" and this is an excellent statment. (I don't believe responsible adults need to be ashsamed of or hide the fact that they are sexual beings.) \n \n This all ties to how I feel we raise women and how I feel that needs to be changed. They are told all their lives - by popular culture and often by religion that having a man is the end-all, be-all of the universe. A good relationship with a good man is a wonderful thing. But there are women who will stick to a loser like glue over dealing with the stigma of being single. I choose to be single and I get jeers about it all the time. \"Can't catch a man??\" (like its that hard). We need to stop making a relationship with a man the measure of success for a woman. It is my belief that this idea is responsible for more unwanted pregancies than anything else. They can't stand the thought of being alone so they will do anything to hold on to that man - including sex, getting pregnanct, etc. I wish girls today understood that their sisters, eons ago, had little to no rights over their own lives and were given away in marriage by their fathers. A lot of these women became nuns. In part because they found freedom and power in celibacy that they would not have had married.",

And because men don't have a choice in what women do with their bodies, they should think carefully upon the consequences of their actions as consenting partners.\n \n \n Nothing I have said in any argument here has been against fathers taking responsibility for their children, at all. What I am arguing, and you are evading/distorting is the fact that men are held to and limited by what the woman decides to do in all cases, whether the baby lives or is killed in the womb, when they are both equally culpable for the pregnancy existing. Pregnancy is a team venture, activity, responsibility and therefore a team decision. \n \n If the father is willing to keep, love and raise the child, then the woman should have the child but be released of all responsibility for raising it. If the woman wants the baby and the father doesn't, and they're not married, then let her have it and raise it alone, freeing him from any responsibility for raising a child he didn't want. That would take care of the millions of cases of women entrapping men into marriage by using pregnancy as a trap. And you know that is a common practice with women.\n \n So where is the equality of consequences since there is equality of cause? Women don't get pregnant alone yet they alone determine the fate of the child in every possible scenario as the man is forced to submit to whatever the woman decides to do even though he is equally responsible for the pregnancy.\n \n \nWhat happens if their partner gets pregnant? Do they agree about how that will be dealt with? If Dad doesn't want a baby, and she does, he's got a long road ahead of him. If Dad does want a baby, and she doesn't, he may be in for some very painful moments. (And sometimes young people don't know their sentiments on these matters until it's the real thing, with the young women entitled to change her mind from anything she said she believed before.)\n\n \n All you are doing here is reiterating that men are victims of the whims of women who don't necessarily have anyones best interests in mind other than their own personal, selfish self interests. A woman can single handedly manipulate and control 2 lives legally just because she is a woman. With one decision she can force a man into servitude for 18 years. And with another decision she can kill an innocent child even if the real and legitimate father wants, and is willing to raise that child which is his child too.\n \n \nGranted, most couples make these decisions together. But ultimately, if a woman gets pregnant, it's her decision whether or not to follow through on the pregnancy.\n \n \n WHY??? Why is a joint creation, only the woman's domain to determine the outcome? What ever happened to cause and effect or taking responsibility for ones actions? How can the man be castrated of all choice and power when he is half of the relationship and DNA in the life being killed, and yet be forced to stay involved for 18 more years against his will if that is the woman's choice? \n \n \nAnd just personally speaking, I wouldn't want to force someone by law to do something they didn't want to do. Especially in a matter as serious as having a baby and raising that person to adulthood.\n \n I'm just saying that DNA in and of itself is not a valid argument.\n\n \n And yet that is PRECISELY what you are endorsing and proscribing for every man when you give the woman the ultimate power to determine the outcome of her pregnancy without even considering what the man wants when he is an equal part of the child's existence. \n \n Now name for me any other example or scenario in life when one of the parties responsible for creating a problem is allowed to decide the outcome at the expense of all others?

   "Read the thread before jumping in lesz, this argument has been made and refuted by me multiple times already.\n\n \n Unfortunately, your refutation is holier than Swiss cheese.\n \n \nThe woman can act as irresponsibly as she wants to but just because she is the incubator, she has absolute control over life and death, and whether the man is forced into financial servitude whether he agrees with her decision or not.\n\n \n Oh, nonsense. First of all, who says the woman is acting \"irresponsibly\"? You do, but all you have to support this claim is your unfounded opinion. Second, the foetus does not have a right to gestation. Where is this right written, and who by? Most conceptions spontaneously abort, anyway. Third, the man always has the option to keep his sperm to himself. If he can't, then he has a responsibility if the child is born. If he doesn't want that responsibility, then he can enter into a legally binding, pre-coital agreement with the woman absolving him of any responsibility. Or he can keep his pecker in his pants. That's the extent of his choice. \n \n And no, the man has no more right to force a woman to carry his genes to term than the foetus has of gestation. All you argue for here, in essence, is a right to rape.\n \n \nIt has constantly been stressed that my argument is in response to a consensual relationship.\n\n \n Well, lots of relationships that result in pregnancy, sadly, are not consensual, but I don't see you arguing for abortion in such cases. Second, consent is usually to the sexual act only, less frequently to the conception of a child and starting a family. Consent to sex shouldn't be read as consent to pregnancy, where the two can be separated.\n \n \nIf you can't see that a man is much more than a sperm donor but is an equal half of what is referred to as a couple, then you have no concept of what the term equality means.\n \n \n If a man and a woman together agree to start a family, then of course he is more than \"just a sperm donor\" he becomes a parent. People who agree to start a family together aren't going to be wanting abortions, or if forced by medical circumstances into considering one, will probably reach agreement to have it or not. It's situations where consent to raise a family hasn't been involved that the issue of abortions can become real. Two people who have sex together aren't necessarily a couple in the sense of a family; indeed, they may have agreed beforehand NOT to start a family.\n \n And in the end, it is still the final right of the person doing the incubating to decide the disposition of her own body. That is a unique situation, without an external analogy. She is slave to neither the husband, the foetus, the church or the state.\n \n \nLet's carry this perspective over to other parts of the man/woman relationship and test how fair it is. When a woman who never works outside of the home, marries a man and then divorces him, doesn't she get alimony as credit for emotionally supporting him as he earned all the money? Why should she? What makes her worth anything more than the cost of a maid for the time they were married?\n \n \n False analogy. A pregnancy is like no other demand on a woman's body or resources. It's a special case.\n \n \nAnd even if they agree before marriage that they will never have children, if the woman breaks that promise and gets pregnant, in the event of divorce the man is still held financially responsible even though he has been deceived and defrauded by the woman. \n\n \n Well, if they have agreed on paper beforehand that she will carry the entire financial responsibility, then you can certainly argue that the state doesn't have a right to forcibly break that agreement and dun the man for child care. On the other hand, I can understand why the state would look to the father if the mother becomes incapable, for any reason, of looking after the child with her own resources. Why should the public pay for their moment of fun?\n \n His solution, if he fears this will be a problem that will come back to bite him, is to keep his pecker in his pants, unless he wants to adopt responsibility for any potential issue. That can't be difficult to do, can it?\n \n \nMy point is women win from all directions and the man gets screwed. Feel free to outline any scenario you can come up with in reality where the man is treated fairly in the area of reproductive rights.\n\n \n No, dear, it's always the woman who gets screwed. Didn't they teach you basic biology? Life isn't fair. The woman takes the vast share of the risk and burden of pregnancy, and invests far more physical resources into it than any man. That is just an unfair fact of life, unfair for men and women. There is no reproductive equality between men and women, never was, and probably never will be. Not even their genes are all equal, as it turns out. So the argument for \"equal rights\" in deciding the fate of a foetus are specious. Objectively speaking, there is no equality at all.\n \n So that argument is full of holes as well.\n \n If you were making an argument against abortion from an assumption of the \"sanctity of life\", i.e. an assumption that life should be treated with reverence, dignity and respect, then you could make a coherent and seemingly plausible case. It would not be compelling, though, because it would be based on the not-so-obvious assumption that all living things are worthy of equal respect, and few would want to go that far. We do not accord equal respect to all forms of life, or even all stages of human life. We never have and it's not likely we ever will.\n \n However, trying to base an argument against abortion because it \"isn't fair\" to men who would force women to bear their children has to be one of the most flaccid ploys in the anti-abort arsenal. It just doesn't pass the giggle test.",

   "Unfortunately, your refutation is holier than Swiss cheese.\n\n \n Not at all lesz, and just because you reject it doesn't make it so at all.\n \n \nOh, nonsense. First of all, who says the woman is acting \"irresponsibly\"? You do, but all you have to support this claim is your unfounded opinion. Second, the foetus does not have a right to gestation. Where is this right written, and who by? Most conceptions spontaneously abort, anyway. Third, the man always has the option to keep his sperm to himself. If he can't, then he has a responsibility if the child is born. If he doesn't want that responsibility, then he can enter into a legally binding, pre-coital agreement with the woman absolving him of any responsibility. Or he can keep his pecker in his pants. That's the extent of his choice.\n\n \n And everything you have said here is nothing more than your opinion lesz. What makes you believe your opinion is any more valid than mine? Is it because you say it in such a condescending way? That neither intimidates nor adds any credibility to what you say at all for me. You so easily dismiss the gestational rights of the unborn as if that decision is right and moral without considering the life you are snuffing out for, in \"many cases\" the convenience of a woman who conceived through irresponsible sexual promiscuity. \n \n \n no, the man has no more right to force a woman to carry his genes to term than the foetus has of gestation. All you argue for here, in essence, is a right to rape.\n\n \n What typical cr*p to infer that I am arguing for the right to rape. I am not even arguing positions I personally support or agree with. What I am doing here is showing that men have absolutely no reproductive rights at all. That under every and all circumstances, the woman can be as sexually irresponsible as the man and still either profit from the pregnancy or end it if that is what suits her, with no regard or concern at all given to either the unborn child itself, or the father who is fully half responsible for the existence of the unborn child existing in the womb. \n \n So you can minimize the value of the child and the man lesz, and you have done it quite well, but that doesn't validate or justify your bigoted opinion which relegates children and men to nothing more than objects to be abused and/or discarded by the women who are in no way victims here but equal participants in the problem existing. \n \n \n, lots of relationships that result in pregnancy, sadly, are not consensual, but I don't see you arguing for abortion in such cases. Second, consent is usually to the sexual act only, less frequently to the conception of a child and starting a family. Consent to sex shouldn't be read as consent to pregnancy, where the two can be separated.\n\n \n Regarding the bolded: Exactly, and that applies to both parties in the relationship. So why is the man left with no power at all to determine the fate of the pregnancy? You say because she is the incubator, And that is where we disagree. Since they both consented to the sex, and since a very real living being who is part of both of them is at stake, then that decision should also be made jointly. But it isn't, is it. And the only reason you can give is because she is the incubator. Not good enough lesz. \n \n \nAnd in the end, it is still the final right of the person doing the incubating to decide the disposition of her own body. That is a unique situation, without an external analogy. She is slave to neither the husband, the foetus, the church or the state.\n\n \n That is your unfounded opinion and I reject your reasoning as unfair and inequitable to the other two parties involved in her pregnancy. Meaning the FATHER and the CHILD.\n \n \n analogy. A pregnancy is like no other demand on a woman's body or resources. It's a special case.\n\n \n A special case that 1) she caused by her own actions. And 2) that affects two other people also as in the Father and the Child. And in the child's situation, his very life is on the line. Since when doesn't a human life trump the convenience of another person?\n \n \nWell, if they have agreed on paper beforehand that she will carry the entire financial responsibility, then you can certainly argue that the state doesn't have a right to forcibly break that agreement and dun the man for child care. On the other hand, I can understand why the state would look to the father if the mother becomes incapable, for any reason, of looking after the child with her own resources. Why should the public pay for their moment of fun?\n \n\n \n Fat chance that would ever happen in the real World. And that even if such a contract was signed by the woman in advance that it would be enforced in a Court of Law.\n \n \n, dear, it's always the woman who gets screwed. Didn't they teach you basic biology? Life isn't fair. The woman takes the vast share of the risk and burden of pregnancy, and invests far more physical resources into it than any man. That is just an unfair fact of life, unfair for men and women. There is no reproductive equality between men and women, never was, and probably never will be. Not even their genes are all equal, as it turns out. So the argument for \"equal rights\" in deciding the fate of a foetus are specious. Objectively speaking, there is no equality at all.\n \n So that argument is full of holes as well.\n \n If you were making an argument against abortion from an assumption of the \"sanctity of life\", i.e. an assumption that life should be treated with reverence, dignity and respect, then you could make a coherent and seemingly plausible case. It would not be compelling, though, because it would be based on the not-so-obvious assumption that all living things are worthy of equal respect, and few would want to go that far. We do not accord equal respect to all forms of life, or even all stages of human life. We never have and it's not likely we ever will.\n \n However, trying to base an argument against abortion because it \"isn't fair\" to men who would force women to bear their children has to be one of the most flaccid ploys in the anti-abort arsenal. It just doesn't pass the giggle test.\n\n \n Nice obfuscation. I asked you this, and I quote:\n \n \nFeel free to outline any scenario you can come up with in reality where the man is treated fairly in the area of reproductive rights.\n\n \n And the above paragraphs is what I get for a response. If you were even trying to be honest and objective, you would just admit that there is no scenario where men are treated fairly in the area of reproductive rights.",

Women never consent to rape by definition, and they do not always consent to pregnancy. Second, we are not talking about a child; we are talking about a foetus. It can't even think or feel at the time abortion is legal. It isn't a person with the same rights as a person.\n \n \nAnd the above paragraphs is what I get for a response. If you were even trying to be honest and objective, you would just admit that there is no scenario where men are treated fairly in the area of reproductive rights.\n\n \n Sweetums, I've been perfectly honest and direct. I've told you what i believe, and I've explained why I believe it. You haven't even come close to understanding what I've been saying, let alone making an argument against it.

One is that embryos and fetuses are NOT Children. You are blatantly misrepresenting developmental stages here.

Or is it that you are not a dishonest lying anti-choicer but rather are incredibly ignorant and didn't know the meanings of the words you used?\n \nBaby at 7 weeks:\nYou must then mean 7 weeks after birth, right?

You can not possibly refer to the embryo, as it is not a baby.\n \nhttp://www.mttu.com/....\nmttu is not exactly a reliable, honest site to use as a reference. Or didn't you know that you have to be a little bit careful about your sources to retain credibility?\n \n Now, I know this doesn't matter to you, because we already know that anti-choicers go for emotional histrionics rather than reality and honesty, so of course you don't care about your sources.

I said that all of them were valid and important issues that I cared about, about 8 in total. She responded that I was allowed to pick as many as 3 issues that I cared about but the program didn't allow for me to pick all of them.\n \n So it is with the questionnaires every woman who gets an abortion must fill out. They have questions about why they are seeking it but not one option is to prevent wide hips, sagging boobs, a ponch stomach or not ready to stop partying, drinking or drugging. Those options aren't even made available to choose as the real reasons why women abort their babies so in your World, they don't even exist. Talk about being told what you must think and buying it hook line and sinker. Get out of that box jito, it has to be awfully tight in there.\n\n \n I so agree with you!!!

These women who are having abortions are selfish, and if thier lives are in danger of carring a child they should have not gotten preagnant in the first place, we all know what happens when we are having sex, dont we?\n\n \n Good job resurrecting a dead thread - however, if you read the post Archie was responding to, I quoted statistical evidence from pro-life and pro-choice sources to shoot down his assertation that women abort due to vanity. He then, and you now, have provided evidence of nothing but your own misogyny.",

Cyclists, especially here in LA, have a high risk of being hit. Probably the same risk of getting pregnant while using contraception. So if a cyclist gets hit by a car, does he accept the risk of being hit and therefore deserve no medical attention?",
