   "\"Mr. Geldof praised Mr. Bush for his work in delivering billions to fight disease and poverty in Africa, and blasted the U.S. press for ignoring the achievement.\n \n Mr. Bush, said Mr. Geldof, \"has done more than any other president so far.\"\n \n \"This is the triumph of American policy really,\" he said. \"It was probably unexpected of the man. It was expected of the nation, but not of the man, but both rose to the occasion.\"\n \n \"What's in it for [Mr. Bush]? Absolutely nothing,\" Mr. Geldof said.\n \n Mr. Geldof said that the president has failed \"to articulate this to Americans\" but said he is also \"###### off\" at the press for their failure to report on this good news story.\n \n \"You guys didn't pay attention,\" Geldof said to a group of reporters from all the major newspapers.\"\n \n More at http://video1.washingtontimes.com/fishwrap/2008/02/bob_geldof_in_rwanda.html",

The money that is given to other countries is money taxed from the citizens of this country.
