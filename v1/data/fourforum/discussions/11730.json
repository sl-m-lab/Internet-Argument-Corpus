   "Today on the campaign trail in the battleground state of Ohio, Barack Obama focused his message on the economic crisis, calling for a coordinated global response. Obama's campaign also suggested that McCain's discussion of Ayers is a sign of desperation and an attempt to distract the voters from the economy, a weak point for McCain. McCain, on the campaign trail, stated that his experience best qualifies him to be president. Source: Truly Newsworthy, www.TrulyNewsworthy.com.\n \n It is clear that the economy is the number one issue in this election. It is also clear that Obama is polling ahead of McCain on the economy. With those two facts combined I find it difficult to see McCain winning this election. We can throw in Ayers and Keating and Bush and racism, but the economic issue simply overrules all of it.",
