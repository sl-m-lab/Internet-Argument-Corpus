   "in my opinion, the education system is the status quo because a country (or society) benefits when everybody is productive in an orderly manner. education gives you knowledge, although its strongly argued that the knowledge you get in school doesnt apply to real-life success. i think the two most important things education accomplishes for society are 1. it produces knowledgeable people that are dependant on the system for their own survival, and 2. its gives you knowledge that WONT make you successful in real life. the reason these two things combined are beneficial for society is because the way the social system is designed, it needs more people on the lower end of the heirarchy than on the higher end. it creates a pyramid scheme (much like those which are illegal) so that those at the base of the pyramid make those on the higher levels richer, while the lowest level participants never recover their losses. and the reason why this is important is that the system cannot survive if nobody is dependent upon it. it needs manpower to feed itself and continue. if everyone was taught in school how to be independently wealthy, then everybody would have to cut their own 6 acre lawns themselves, for example. so, thanks to the education system, in ensures that the majority of people in society stay somewhere on the low end of the pyramid, and dependent on the orderly production system which it needs to maintain the status quo\n \n i think your professor seems like a cool guy",

Formulas are always the same, they don't change because one person has a different creative understanding.

   "Today's responses, so far, seem to be much more serious and thought out than those from earlier on, and I'm glad of that. So far they touch on curriculum, and , lightly, pedagogy. I would like to go deeper and seek a basic philosophy of education. What, really, is education for; that is, who does the system serve?\n \n It seems to me that since the 60's education the basic philosophy of education is that it is supposed to serve the students and their supposed needs. That is one core assumption of one philosophy of education.\n \n Authoritarian regimes with a fascist underpinning, even where nominally 'socialist', say the basic purpose of an education system is to serve the 'the state', by which they mean themselves, the ruling class, the cadres of corporate and political power brokers. \n \n Another philosophy is the conservative approach, wherebye the parents, viewed as having 'property rights' to their own children, insist that they have the right to order the system to do exactly what they tell it to do. IOW, that curriculum, pedagogy, methods, materials, and all else be their decision, and no-one else's. Most particularly, not the responsibility of either professional educators, the state, the society as a whole, or, above all else, the children themselves.\n \n The last philosophical premise of education I can think of off the top of my head, (doubtless there are others), is that public education should not be centred upon, nor directed to the advantage of, any particular segment of society, (such as the ruling elites, the parents, the children involved, or the bureaucrats/public servants who run it, or the teachers who actually carry out the duties involved), but to the 'summum bono' of the entire society, as a single, whole, intergrated community, no matter how demographically pluralistic it may be.
