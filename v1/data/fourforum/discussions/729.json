   "From what I've understood from reading the pro-gun control messages posted on this board, I believe that gun control works under the following ideals:\n \n 1) Everyone will give up their right to own a gun for the good of society.\n 2) Because everyone is giving up their gun, then there will be no murder using guns because no one will have access to them.\n 3) Since there will be no murder using guns, then society will be better off.\n \n Basically, this reminds me of Marx's ideas of communism, which work under the following ideals:\n \n 1) Everyone gives up some of their right to free choice for the good of society.\n 2) Because everyone gives up part of their free choice, the government can then distribute jobs which everyone will perform to better society.\n 3) Since everyone is working towards building a better society, then society will be better off.\n \n In a utopia, both communism and gun control would work to their maximum potential. Everyone would give up their guns, and without them, society is better off.\n \n However, we do not live in a utopia. Unfortunately, with communism, we learned that although most people went along with the idea, there were still a few who wanted to screw everyone else over. In the end, society was worse off with communism than it was before communism was implemented.\n \n Gun control will fall apart the same way communism did. The criminals will be the group that trys to screw everyone. They will see law-abiding citizens, now unarmed, and they will realize that their gun means power. And don't try to tell me that they won't be able to get guns. If they don't already have them, they can get them on the black market. Illegalizing alcohol didn't keep people from drinking it. Illegalizing marijuana didn't keep the people at my high school from getting it (and I doubt it does anywhere else either). Illegalizing guns won't keep those who want guns away from getting them. All it will do is give criminals more power and put more money in the hands of those that sell guns (the same way that it happened with alcohol and marijuana).\n \n Thus, the criminals now have guns; the law-abiding citizens do not. Now, we have just given the criminals an advantage in the fight against crime. Now, they have guns, and those they take from do not. Now, they can kill even easier than they could before, because they can be relatively sure that those they take from do not have a weapon.\n \n Marx eventually denounced communism as an idea that looked good on paper, but failed in practice. Gun control will work the same way. It will look like a great idea on paper, but in the end, it will fail if we ever put it into practice. Why should America put something into practice when we are relatively confident that it will fail?",

   "It's emotion over logic. The emotional response of \"but it would be all warm and fuzzy if we got rid of guns\" overrides the logical argument that says that if guns were illegal only criminals would own them. Keep in mind the marxist/communist agenda begs on the emotional knee jerk reaction of emotion over logic. They are searching for the Utopia society, which cannot and will never exist because humanity is flawed. Humans are not perfect. \n Emotion overrides logic often in the political arena, because the warm fuzzies sound better than reality which is rather cold and harsh.",
