   "The Congregational Church in my boyhood home that I grew up in Northern Minnesota has closed for good. It was an integral part of the small town of 500 people where I was raised, located one block off Main Street. It was an unassuming rectangular building, with none of the outlandish spires and steeples common in some other churches; it was well-kept in fresh white paint and a manicured lawn. The only way one could identify it as a church was by the dignified sign along the street.\n \n I knew nothing of Congregationalism in my youthful years. I didn't know, for instance, that it was the religion of the Pilgrims who landed at Plymouth Rock in 1620. I was unaware of the significance of its name in understanding this particular religion-the importance placed in the sovereignty of each individual church with no outside interference, with each member's vote counting equally; in other words, the democracy and primacy of the congregation--not the hierarchy--in deciding church affairs and direction. \n \n Congregationalism was born in England, in spite of the Church of England's monopoly. Many of its ideas were closely in step with Presbyterianism, a conservative brand of Protestantism, but distinguished itself by rejecting all outside authority. Their motto: \"No pope, prelate, presbyter, prince, or parliament.\" Each church recognized only their pastor, elders, and deacons (pastor's aides) as authority, all of whom were duly elected by the church members, who were also voted in as members if they could demonstrate an understanding of basic church dogma and fellowship. \n \n This fierce independence is what caused the Pilgrims to flee to America when they felt threatened by the Anglican Church, which was attempting to bring the followers of Robert Browne, the father of Congregationalism, back into the fold. Unfortunately, once established in the colonies, it became more intolerant than the church it wished to escape persecution from. A form of theocracy was implemented, wherein the local church instructed the town what the law was by its interpretation of the Bible, while the town's police and legal system enforced the laws. This dangerous form of governance was still in practice in Massachusetts as late as 1834. Dissent was stifled, and laws were written proscribing punishments including scourging, exile, and even death in certain cases.\n \n Yet paradoxically, a seed planted in early Congregationalism began to mature and bear fruit in the States. An emphasis was placed on education, and on discovering the truths inherent in nature. It is no accident that Harvard and Yale were both founded by Congregationalists. A curiosity about the here and now, unknown to most sects, was another distinguishing feature of this religion. The object of Congregationalism, as expressed in their charter states, \"...Congregationalists seek democratic life and organization, simplicity and vitality of faith, intellectual freedom to follow the dictates of conscience enlightened by the Holy Spirit, educational quality...\"\n \n A dynamism began to take hold in the members on a national scale. Unfettered by any outside authority telling them what to think, along with a healthy pursuit of knowledge, combined to bring degrees of liberalism and rationalism to the various churches. Some conservative members, fearful of these developments, attempted to bring the churches under more central control. They succeeded in carving out various districts which sought to instill more uniformity to issues of polity, and instituted tight controls in pastor certification. \n \n Too late! Membership began to decline proportionally as early as the 19th century. The liberal drift was unstoppable. By the 1950's, a huge portion of the churches voted to merge into the Unitarian Church, a church I believe even I could join without much trepidation. Only about 70,000 Congregationalists remained, spread throughout America.\n \n And so, in 2001, the Congregational Church in my old hometown closed its doors for good. The old-timers were dead, and the newer generations were not too interested in keeping a once-proud and democratic church tradition alive. The well-kept church I recall from years ago is showing its neglect now, and the city mows the grass when time and resources allow. It gives me hope that people, when left to their own devices and common sense, free to pursue knowledge and truth beyond the reach of pronouncing popes and meddling presbyters, can overcome the stultifying, fearful grip of religion.",

   "Correction:\n \n I have been unable to verify the Unitarian/Congregational merger I mentioned above. It appears to be in error. Rather, a large percentage of Congregationalists in the late 1950's instead merged with the Evangelical Synod and Reformed churches, two like-minded, progressive bodies. Together, the three formed the United Church of Christ, attempting to bring closer fellowship and communion to members of the impossibly fractured Protestant movement.\n \n The effect of the merger remains the same: it bled off nearly all its liberal and moderate elements, leaving only a small (70,000) core of conservatives to carry on the Congregational tradition, be it in name only.",
