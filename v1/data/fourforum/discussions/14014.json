It is a mindset that needed to be changed. It took several incidents, that finally made our mostly Anti-gun Attorney General issue a memorandum to all Ohio police departments.\n \n   Open carry of firearms is a legal activity in Ohio \n \n Although my link to the memo has expired, we do have this. \n   Ohio's attorney General informs that Open Carry legal activity in ohio \n Atorney General's office has made available to new Concealed Carry Law publication through their website. This publication is required reading for all CHL applicants, and is available free of charge. \n \n This edition of the publication also includes notice of the legality of open carry on page 18. \n \n Open Carry\n Ohio's concealed carry laws do not regulate \"open\" carry of firearms. If you openly carry, use caution. The open carry of firearms is a legal activity in Ohio. \n\n There needs to be some education in order for Antis, cops or anyone else to make the distinction between criminal and Lawful activities.\n \n Ignorance is NO EXCUSE IN THE LAW! Or that is what the policemen always said when I was growing up. emoticon_smile\n \n We need everyone to obey the law and respect lawful activities. Violating my rights is a crime. That is a Fact!",

   "First, I'd like to thank the powers that be, for Michigan being an OPEN CARRY state. Hope TX jumps on-board soon. I'm just going to post a couple of CPL (/CCW/LTCH/etc) rules from the Great Lakes State. For one, if you're a CPL holder, upon being pulled over, you must immediately disclose to the officer that you're armed and licensed. At that point, the officer will have you do whatever he/she feels will ensure his/her safety, which could include: taking posession of the firearm for the duration of the stop; proning you out on a vehicle; or perhaps nothing at all. It's left to the officer's discretion. Be compliant. No biggy. While this is law here, it's a good idea ANYWHERE.\n \n True, that if an officer runs my plate, it will show that I have a CPL. However, I could be driving my wife's car. No flags would pop up from her plate, and the officer would have no way of knowing that I could be legally armed. Again, immediately disclose. Cops don't like surprises and normally you wouldn't want to be the one to surprise them. There are two cops you don't want to have to interact with: 1) a XXXXXX off cop, and 2) a nervous cop.\n \n STAY IN YOUR CAR, DON'T MAKE BIG MOVEMENTS, AND KEEP YOUR HANDS IN PLAIN SIGHT!!! ...Yes, whether you're armed or NOT!\n \n I thought this to be common sense by now but apparently maybe not all THAT common.
