   "Twenty-one years ago a group of prominent Japanese veterans funded by wealthy, ultra-conservative descendants of World War II era military families attempted to enact official legislation that would provide all Japanese schools with new History books that completely re-wrote the factual record of WWII. The new history intended to be taught to all Japanese children included twisted but skillfully written revisions that described the \"retributive\" Japanese \"strike\" on Pearl Harbor as a totally \"defensive\" response that \"necessarily\" followed a series of unprovoked, brutal and merciless air and naval attacks by the United States on Japanese territory.\" The new textbooks would also state that Japanese Intelligence had uncovered \"a massive plot\" by the United States to launch a \"horrific invasion on the Japanese homeland which the Pearl Harbor strike thwarted by four years.\" Needless to say, this revised history intended to whitewash and justify the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was fictitious. International pressure convinced the Japanese government to condemn the lies and cancel publication of these textbooks. \n \n What the well-funded group of Japanese revisionists attempted to do in Japan twenty-one years ago is now being attempted by a group of American veterans here in the United States. And like the veteran's organization in Japan that wanted to rewrite Japanese history, a group of American veterans funded by wealthy ultra-conservatives is attempting to make Americans march to the beat of their drum and subscribe to their version of history... a revised history that has been proven completely false according to irrefutable military documents and previous statements made by some in the group now attempting to rewrite American military history for the benefit of their political candidate. \n \n This small group of highly partisan veterans funded by political party loyalists want all Americans to ignore established, fully documented history and replace undisputed facts with a newly written version they have adopted to suit their political goals. If the \"Swift Boat\" vets opposing their former fellow unit member had their way they would have every medal lawfully awarded to John Kerry rescinded and wiped from every military record. And if they had the power to do so, they would viciously strip John Kerry of his Honorable Discharge and replace it with a discharge of dishonor... and therefore render him unelectable. Any witness to the level of partisan hatred the \"Swift Boat\" vets have vehemently expressed for John Kerry would undoubtedly come to this conclusion. And this is why every American veteran, regardless of our political affiliation, must decisively reject and oppose the partisan campaign of the \"Swift Boat\" vets. \n \n To support the \"Swift Boat\" vets in their wholly un-American effort to falsely and maliciously revise factual history solely for the purpose of gaining more votes for their political candidate would be to put at risk the personal military history of every American veteran who chose not to agree with a political candidate who had immensely deep pockets to fund a vindictive, personal campaign of destructive hate. Twice in recent history we have seen the same well-funded partisan program at work to decimate the patriotism and history of an American veteran who chose to disagree with George W. Bush. \n \n Back in 2000... to portray George W. Bush -- who never flew in combat or against an enemy target -- as a superior pilot compared to John McCain, the same partisan machine produced reams of factless propaganda alleging that John McCain became a prisoner of war solely because of \"pilot incompetence\" and \"political ambitions\" To denigrate and devaluate John McCain's record of courage and determination as a Prisoner of War the well-financed machine that contributed heavily to George Bush's campaign claimed that John McCain cooperated with his captors to the degree of betraying his fellow captives. Sadly, there were a few former POWs to be found and bought who would come forward with completely unsubstantiated statements agreeing to John McCain's \"disservice\" to his fellow POW's and to our flag. By the time the Bush Family machine was done with John McCain a large number of Americans were in no doubt that John McCain had purposely staged his own capture solely for the purpose of using his POW experience in later years to seek high political office. Not surprisingly, the \"Swift Boat\" vets are making similarly false accusations against John Kerry. \n \n Of course, the slanderous lies spread about John McCain were eventually proven false... but only long after John McCain was forced to abandon his campaign for the presidency in favor of the man whom the malicious propaganda was intended to benefit. Today that same well-funded partisan machine is at work once again to divide the American veteran community with a false history of John Kerry based on doctored memories, a brief opportunity for fame, upcoming personal or profitable enrichment, and a jealous desire to have their names written in history with equal mention of a man who would be president. \n \n The danger the \"Swift Boat\" vets pose for all American veterans is unmistakably similar to the evils American military men and women fought against in all of our wars: totalitarian, dictatorial, partisan domination. The new 'military code' the \"Swift Boat\" vets want to impose on both the American veteran and military community is this: \"If you challenge our candidate or oppose our political Party we will do everything in our power to destroy you. We will revise history, we will twist facts and we will buy witnesses against you.\" \n \n Earlier I said that if the \"Swift Boat\" vets were given official power they would no doubt rewrite John Kerry's military records to suit their hatred and political desires. They would cancel his medals and insert cowardice. This sadistic and vengeful power should frighten every American veteran lawfully awarded a military medal... and this is why.... in 2002 George W. Bush issued an Executive Order re-writing the National Defense Service Medal Act to actively and retro-actively award this medal to individuals whom the creators of the original Act determined should not be included based on type of service, not character of service. Deliberately, the new version of the NDSM Act approved by George W. Bush enabled his own non-active military service to become eligible for this medal. Obviously, if a president finds it in his desire to re-write the eligibility rules of a long-standing military medal regulation to make his own military service eligible he can or might do the same for other medals... that is, to make himself eligible or remove the eligibility of others. No previous president in American history prior to George W. Bush has ever rewritten a military medal regulation that automatically rendered him eligible for. \n \n Today, millions of aging American veterans are now deeply concerned about the future legitimacy of their medals. Frightened veterans are making the decision to change their support from John Kerry to George Bush because they fear the unsympathetic power of the monolithic Department of Veteran Affairs and the possibility that one day they might find themselves hated and victimized by those who have the power to harm their benefits, question the validity of or rescind their medals and or VA eligibility to deprive them of needed services. \n \n Fear, threat and persecution of all American veterans accompany the attack of the \"Swift Boat\" vets on the honorable military record of John Kerry. Through the \"Swift Boat\" vets vicious and slanderous attack on John Kerry every American veteran is being forewarned by the \"Swift Boat\" vets and their powerfully rich backers that if you publicly oppose George W. Bush in person, or in polls traced to your telephone number, you risk terrible revenge should George Bush be re-elected and those who support him... the \"Swift Boat\" vets... are rewarded with high positions of influence over the VA benefits or employability of those who served in our Armed Forces. All veterans, and particularly those who served during the Vietnam War era, well understand how monolithic and totalitarian influence can harm their rightful and earned access to military benefits. To this day, many Vietnam Era veterans fearfully refuse to seek VA assistance because they well remember how an influential group of ultra-conservative veterans blocked their access to VA reception and services in the 1960's, 70's and 80's. \n \n Americans have always gone to war to oppose Orwellian dictators and their well-funded henchmen who twist facts, rewrite history, reverse their previously documented statements, launch destructive personal attacks, and sway public opinion against anyone who fails to swear their votes and show public support for those who have the power to make their lives miserable. \n \n George W. Bush has repeatedly made the threatening statement: \"You are either with us or against us!\" Which means if you choose not to swear loyalty to George W. Bush you will be considered an expendable enemy of George W. Bush... who also said... \"I reject the politics of personal destruction.\" George Bush now rejects that latter statement by his refusal to condemn the \"Swift Boat\" vet's \"politics of personal destruction.\" Through the \"Swift Boat\" vets George W. Bush and his wealthy funders are communicating a subliminal threat of personal destruction to any American veteran who supports John Kerry. The \"Swift Boat\" vets are letting all veterans know if they can successfully go after a veteran who is highly visible they can easily come after us who don't have John Kerry's money, visibility or media access. \n \n American veterans must remember that in previous wars when facing similar threats from dictators we made the courageous and correct decision that if we permanently remove the dictator we permanently remove the dictator's threats. By rejecting the lies and partisan propaganda of the \"Swift Boat\" vets American veterans will send a patriotic and determined signal to future dictatorial and totalitarian wannabes that they cannot and will not succeed. \n \n -- 30 -- \n \n \n -- The above was submitted for publication by an Identity Redacted Vietnam veteran and is not copyrighted. \n \n -- Otis Willie, \n Associate Librarian \n The American War Library \n http://www.amervets.com \n 16907 Brighton Avenue \n Gardena CA 90247-5420 \n (310) 532-0634",

   "Duo,\n Your post makes a few good points, but mainly focuses on scare tactics. Let me say this: John Kerry&#8217;s &#8220;war&#8221; record is not the best &#8211; he knows it, we know it, probably the whole world knows it. But he did volunteer for combat. That&#8217;s enough said on that. No one will ever know the whole truth, but let the medals speak for themselves. He got them, they are his and it&#8217;s documented. How he got them and exactly why is moot, really.\n \n What is a major factor to his campaign is what he did after his tour of duty. Despite all the hype, all the innuendos, all the mudslinging, his behavior was inappropriate. Now, if he did not use his war record, as a platform, then this would be a non-issue, would it not? I don&#8217;t agree with the tactics attacking his service &#8211; that&#8217;s un-American, IMO, but he dug this hole himself --- (1) denouncing his military service, (2) part of the anti-war movement &#8211; which was his right, I might add, (3) called for and embraced draft-dodging, etc. \n Of course, if I ran for president, the list would be longer on something else, but the facts remain &#8211; he did those things.\n \n And as far as Bush being a part of this? It&#8217;s hearsay.\n \n BTW &#8211; Did GW volunteer for combat? No. Kerry did. Think about that.\n \n This little political playground is as bad as the Peterson double-murder trial &#8211; a fiasco, IMHO.",

   "I saw a video clip on TV that I cannot find online. It shows Adrian Lonsdale praising Kerry during his 1996 Senate Campaign.\n \n He said:\n \n 'He and I and others used to have long discussions at the officers club,' said Mr. Lonsdale of Mattapoisett, a former Coast Guard officer who commanded a division in which the Massachusetts senator was attached back in 1969. 'They were very spirited discussions about the war and the politics back home.' \n \n \"'He was opposed to the war but it didn't make any difference in his performance,' said the former owner and still instructor at Northeast Maritime Institute in New Bedford. 'He was a very good officer.' \n\n http://www.disinfopedia.org/wiki.phtml?title=Adrian_Lonsdale\n http://nomoreapples.blogspot.com/2004/08/repost-swift-boat-veterans-for-truth.html\n \n \n\"He earned his medals, he did what he was supposed to do in Vietnam,\" said retired Coast Guard Captain Adrian Lonsdale.\n\n http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2004/05/04/25m_ad_campaign_showcaes_kerrys_career/\n \n How about George Elliot:\n \nGeorge Elliot, \"John Kerry has not been honest about what happened in Vietnam.\"\n \n Reality\n George Elliott was NOT a crewmate of John Kerry's\n \n Was Elliott Honest in 1996 When He Said This of Kerry?\n \"The fact that he chased an armed enemy down is not something not to be looked down upon but it was an act of courage. And the whole outfit served with honor...\"[T]here was no question that it was above and beyond anything that we had seen down there in that case at that time frame...It just so happened that this one was so outstanding that the Silver Star was eventually awarded.\" [Kerry Press Conference, 10/27/96] \n \n In 1969, Elliott Wrote This to Describe John Kerry's Fitness as a SWIFT Boat Commander\n \"In a combat environment often requiring independent, decisive action, LTJG Kerry was unsurpassed. He constantly reviewed tactics and lessons learned in river operations and applied his experience at every opportunity. On one occasion, while in tactical command of a three boat operation his units were taken under fire from ambush. LTJG Kerry rapidly assessed the situation and ordered his units to turn directly into the ambush. This decision resulted in routing the attackers with several KIA. LTJG Kerry emerges as the acknowledged leader in his peer group. His bearing and appearance are above reproach. He has of his own volition learned the Vietnamese language and is instrumental in the successful Vietnamese training program. During the period of this report LTJG Kerry has been awarded the Silver Star medal, the Bronze Star medal, the Purple Heart medal (2nd and 3rd awards).\"[U.S. Navy, Officer Fitness Report signed by George Elliott; 18, Dec 1969]\n\n http://boards.historychannel.com/threaded.jsp?forum=30046&thread=300020092&start=4&msgSeq=4.1.2.1.2\n \n \nAdmiral Elmo Zumwalt (deceased, represented at SwiftVets by his son, Lt. Col. James Zumwalt): ...the fabled and distinguished chief of naval operations (CNO), Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, told me -- 30 years ago when he was still CNO -- that during his own command of US naval forces in Vietnam...young Kerry had created great problems for him and the other top brass, by killing so many non-combatant civilians and going after other non-military targets. \"We had virtually to straight[sic]-jacket him to keep him under control,\" the admiral said.\n \n [Boston Globe, June 16, 2003:] Under Zumwalt's command, swift boats would aggressively engage the enemy. Zumwalt, who died in 2000, calculated in his autobiography that these men under his command had a 75% chance of being killed or wounded during a typical year. ...\n \n Oh yeah, Kerry ranked up there with Calley and the My Lai massacre, but it's OK to put our men in the kind of danger referred to above for \"no better reason than showing the flag.\"\n \n Veterans who can't forgive John Kerry for his anti-war activities might want to give that a closer look -- looks like he was thinking of the troops' welfare even before he left the service. Certainly more than you can say for our current leadership.\n\n http://nomoreapples.blogspot.com/2004/08/repost-swift-boat-veterans-for-truth.html",
