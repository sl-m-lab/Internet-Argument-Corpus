   "My furry white friend has made the statement that Young Earth Creationists make no predictions. I wanted to kick off a thread with some.\n \n Creationist Predictions\n \n Creationism has been criticized for not making testable predictions. Therefore I will make some predictions based on creationism. If these are refuted, it will not necessarily mean that creationism is false, but that the theory needs revision. If these are confirmed, it will not necessarily mean that creationism is true, but it will tend to support it.\n First, I assume that in the original creation, organisms were created for a variety of different environments. Since there is a continuum of environments, we should also expect to see a continuum of organisms. However, since there were only a finite number of different kinds of organisms at the creation, this continuum should be composed of a finite set of discrete organisms.\n \n So we should expect to find reptiles and amphibians, each adapted for a different environment. Since there are environments in between, we should also expect to find organisms having some characteristics of reptiles and some characteristics of amphibians. Thus we should expect to find sequences of organisms A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H where A is a reptile and H is an amphibian, and the characteristics of the organisms gradually become more amphibian-like and less reptile-like. However, there will not be any links between A and B, or between B and C, et cetera, because these are a finite set of discrete organisms.\n \n In addition, since these organisms were all created at about the same time, and did not evolve from one another, we should not expect to find any clear ancestor-descendent relationship between different organisms in the fossil record. In fact, it should be very difficult to construct reasonable and convincing phylogenies of organisms. Furthermore, we should not expect living creatures to have a clear hierarchical relationship, in most respects, since they were created for a continuum of environments.\n \n Now, since the basic organisms were created recently, we should expect all of the descendents of a created kind to be very similar. They should generally have the same number of chromosomes, and the same genes at the same locations on corresponding chromosomes. They also should often be able to interbreed, which should make tracing their evolutionary relationships fairly complex. In addition, their nuclear and mitochondrial DNA should be fairly similar. However, between different created kinds, we should generally expect to find greater differences in the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA.\n \n In fact, we should be able to quantify how much genetic diversity there is within a species. The genetic diversity measures the probability that a corresponding base pair of DNA will differ between two randomly chosen individuals. If the genetic diversity is 1/100, this means that two randomly chosen individuals will differ in about 1/100 of their DNA. We predict that the amount of genetic diversity should be consistent with the theory of neutral evolution and an origin about 6,000 years ago. We choose the theory of neutral evolution because one would expect created beings to be optimal in some sense, so that very few mutations would be beneficial. Thus the great majority of mutations should be neutral or slightly harmful.\n \n Thus if we know the rate r of mutation per generation, which is the percent change in DNA per generation, and the generation time g in years, then the genetic (nucleotide) diversity should be about 2(6000/g)r, since there will be 6000/g generations since the creation and each one will tend to contribute 2r to the genetic diversity. Or it could be less, for species originating more recently. This means that for organisms with similar rates of mutation, we should expect the genetic diversity to be inversely proportional to the generation time. It is reasonable to assume, for example, that most of the mammals have similar rates of mutation, since many of the mammals are very similar genetically. This implies that the genetic diversity of mammal species should generally be inversely proportional to their generation times. Similar comments apply to the amount of genetic difference between species that have diverged from a created kind since the creation.\n \n The hypervariable parts of the mitochondrial DNA control regions appear to mutate at a rate of about one percent every 200 to 300 generations in humans, and this seems to be a reasonable figure for any organism having about the same number of cell divisions in the female germ line (24) as man. So for this part of the mitochondrial DNA, we can let r be about 1/20,000, and our above formula gives a genetic diversity of 2(6000/g)(1/20,000) or 0.6/g. Thus with a generation time of 20 years for humans we should expect a diversity of 0.6/20 or 0.03 in the hypervariable regions of the mitochondrial DNA. For organisms with a one year generation time, and about 20 cell divisions in the female germ line, we should expect a diversity of about 60 percent. Of course, as one approaches the limit of 75 percent, these estimates of genetic diversity have to be reduced to some extent, because there will be many repeated mutations at the same base pair.\n \n A similar calculation can be done on the nuclear DNA, assuming that most of it is non-functional. However, this calculation should be based on mutation rates that are directly observed as differences in DNA sequences from one generation to the next, and not based on evolutionary assumptions.\n \n \n The original author David A. Plaisted deserves credit for his work .",

   "Thus we should expect to find sequences of organisms A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H where A is a reptile and H is an amphibian, and the characteristics of the organisms gradually become more amphibian-like and less reptile-like.\n\n Why would creationists predict this? I understand why they might, with some suitable assumptions about the creator, predict that the niches would be filled by some sort of creature; but how does creationism predict the actual form of the species?\n \n Let me give you an example. There are mammals that are completely terrestrial, like weasels, and mammals that are completely aquatic, like whales. Does creationism predict that there should be animals in niches in between? Well, sure, there are: sea otters are mammals with a basic terrestrial design that live primarily in the sea; seals are even more aquatic, must spend some of their time on land; manatees are entirely aquatic, but could be much more streamlined; and finally whales are completely aquatic. So we do see a sequence of form from completely terrestrial to completely aquatic.\n \n However, these are not a single evolutionary line. These animals all belong to different branches on the Linnaean classification. Now whales are already known to share some subtle characteristics with ancient animals related to artiodactyls; however, seals have nothing to do with artiodactyls -- they evolved from a completely different ancestor. Nor do seals have anything in common with whales (other than basic mammalness). No evolutionist has ever proposed that seals are related to the line that gave rise to whales.\n \n What evolution predicts, though, is that there should be fossils that do bridge the gap between the ancestral species and modern whales - fossils that have been found. Now these aren't just any old seal-like or manatee-like animal that can be place on a different branch in the Linnean system -- in all respects, in most of their characteristic, they show definite traits of the ancient artiodactyl ancestor changing into definite whale traits.\n \n Now, we have terrestrial mammals, and we have whales. Why didn't the creator simply make seals and sea otters and manatees and be done with it? Why did she also make these animals that are in between whales and the ancient ancestor?\n \n Now go back to the amphibian/reptile example. Why didn't the creator just make animals, like seal and manatees, that are in between amphibians and reptiles in superficial form and be done with it? Why did she make these animals, in shape of the skull, in shape of the limbs, in the shape of the shoulder blades, teeth, and so forth intermediate between the amphibians and reptiles?\n \n Now be careful of my point: if the creator wanted to make mammals in a land-to-sea series, she could just make a series of animals with no clear relation -- in fact, she did: the otter/seal/manatee/whale series. Yet she also decided to make a pakicetus/ambulocetus/basilosaurus/whale series that shows clear transitional features. Why?\n \n If she wants to make species sea-to-land, why doesn't she just create a bunch of species that are between amphibians and reptiles, but with no real connection between them except for habitat? Why did she create species that show clear transitionsal features?",

   " ... Why did she also make ... If she wants to make species ...\n\n \n OOoooOoOooh! You're one of 'those' people. All the revisioning of history makes so much more sense now. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n PB, this simply states that God created a continuum of environments and continuum of animals suited for those environments. I think you, The Barbarian, and Close_slave_can are basically asking the same question. The problem is, you are all trying to look at these predictions through the lense of the evolutionary paradigm. \n \n In order for this to be understood, you have to think outside the evolutionary paradigm - think outside the box that your minds have been forced into for so long. You have to take off those evolutionary lenses - or goggles - and look at this from a different perspective. \n \n The biblical (YEC) model doesn't work under the framework of molecules to man. In our model, the Bible says that man and animals were created separately and reproduce after their own kind. So in this model, animals were created as fully functioning creatures without ancestors, long periods of time, or building up from one classification to another (IE - no going from reptiles to mammals). There were mammals created for a continuum of environments... there were reptiles created for a continuum of environments... there were birds created for a continuum of environments. While a bird is free to reproduce and drift within it's own kind, it will never turn into a reptile, and vice versa. Furthermore, in science we see that mutation does not give rise to an increase of information in an organism (information is basically 'specified complexity'). Therefore, the changes (mutations) we see in organisms will always be a neutral re-arrangement or a loss of information. This is determined by selection and isolation. \n \n For example - there are many varieties and species of dog - but they are all still dogs. Through selective breeding we see isolation of specific characteristics. This occurs through isolation of specific genes. The predecessor dog species (or master dog 'kind') from Noah's Ark or at creation would have had all the information necessary to speciate into the many varieties we see today. Contrasted with evolution, this is an almost de-evoltion - we go from HIGH information/LOW specificity to LOW information/HIGH specificity. As mutation occurs, some information is lost, thereby increasing the expression of specific genes and traits present in the original created ancestor. As natural selection and isolation pressures are applied, we see specific species forming from the original 'master' kind. While some mutations may be beneficial, none are an increase of information. It is either neutral or a loss. Therefore we see species accross the spectrum of environments suited to their environment by natural selection. We would also expect to see a large number of extinctions of specific species in an area where the environment underwent a dramatic change - as creatures who had lost the information necessary for survial outside their specific environment died out. Clearly, they would not be able to increase their information content thorugh mutation, therefore they would have to re-combine their DNA through breeding with like kinds. If their speciation had made this impossible, they would certainly be at a severe disadvantage outside the environment they had speciated to. Natural selection has a way of destroying these animals if environmental changes occur. So the fossil record should show a large number of fossils during environmental changes, and we should see extinctions happing regularly with overspeciated kinds. We might also expect to see the populations of a particular species of kind explode into the dominant variety of that kind in the area after an environmental change as the environment moved to natually select that species over previous species. We could also expect species no longer suited to a changing environment begin migrating to areas where the environment was still suited to them. Along with this migration we would expect to see new species form as animals moved out of the isolation in intermixed with the greater population of species decendent under that kind. These new species, now endowed with the best of both their ancestors might have a much higher probability for survival in a variety of environments (rather than being solely suited to a particular environment). We might expect these animals to be more hardy and robust than either of the more speciated parents as the information content would be higher than either individual parent. However, even through specific breeding to try to reach the maximum information level, the information content of the originally created individuals of that kind would be the 'highest' level of information that creature could obtain. Also, as it pertains to people, the Bible shows that Adam was created in the image of God and was pronounced 'good'. Also, we see that immediately after being created Adam and Eve had the ability to speak, to communicate with God, to think critically, and creatively. It stands to reason, then that God created Adam and Eve with their intellect intact and that given what we have already described about informaton content, the early humans had a vastly superior capability for intellect and knowledge. We can see this demonstrated in ancient engineering marvels such as the Ark, the pyramids, etc. They would have also been far healthier with far less genetic defects leading to disease... and a much higher capacity to fight illness. Life spans would probably be quite longer than we see today. \n \n While this is mostly off the top of my head, it does tend to follow (albeit my own interpretation) the YEC line of reasoning. It goes from creation of discreet individuals with the maximum information content to the present where we have less information containing derrivitives of the originals, speciated and selected to their environments. This includes people. \n \n The Bible shares several mechanisms for the isolation and 'speciation' of human beings as well. Firstly, during the flood tectonic plates began moving which led to the continents forming (the mother of all isolating environments). Secondly, the event of the Tower of Babel - where God separated and isolated people into groups by language. This would have had a significant effect on people forming into groups thereby isolating their gene pools and creating the 'races' we see today. \n \n Contasting the Bible with Darwin's book \"Origins of species and preservation of favored races\" we see that the Bible paints a very clear picture that Racism is rediculous. We are all direct decendents of Adam - we are all the same race. Evolution paints a very different picture (at least in Darwin's book) - claiming that it is possible for particular races to be more evolved than others. For the sake of Political Correctness many evolutionists reject this notion - however it is non-the-less possible of the evolutionary paradigm. \n \n Keep in mind that I am not a geneticist - so I wouldn't have the raw data you requested, C_s_c. I am merely stating a layman's observations of what we should expect to see.",

Do you have a reason for this opinion? Do you know what it means to falsify a prediction?\n \n \n \n \nThese are not a series of transitions, but rather continuum of discreet animals built for a continuum of environments.\n\n Which is exactly what the theory of evolution predicts. The theory of evolution if true (of course you have to assume the theory is true to make the predictions) then each of today's species arose from earlier species through a gradual transformation over a long period of time. This means that there should be what is called transitional fossils. That is, we should find fossils that show characteristics intermediate between modern species and ancient ancestors. For example, it was known that birds share a lot of characteristics with reptiles. It was hypothesized that birds evolved from a reptile ancestor. It was predicted that a species should have existed in the past that mix characteristics of birds and reptiles -- it should have had characteristics that reptiles have but no modern bird has, and it should have characteristics that birds have but no ancient reptile has. Archeaopterix was discovered, which does in fact mix the characteristics between birds and reptiles (in this case, the reptiles were actually theropod dinosaurs). This is an example of a prediction being confirmed. To falsify this prediction, you must demonstrate that archeaopterix has no reptile characteristics whatsoever, or that it has no bird characterisics whatsoever.\n \n \n \n \nLets assume the Bible is true.\n\n Fine. You need to make this assumption to make a prediction. Let us assume that Genesis is literally true. Proceed.\n \n \n \nLets assume that there are no heirarchical relationships,\n\n Wha...?

Assuming that Genesis is literally true, what can we predict that we will see in the fossil record?\n \n \n \nWow - it looks like God created a continuum of distinct, discreet, yet similar creatures to habitate a continuum of environments.\n\n Wha...? How is this a prediction of a literal Genesis? How does this conclusion follow logically from a literal reading of Genesis? If I did not already know anything about the fossil record, how could I know, just from creationist theory, that a continuum of distinct creatures should exist to inhabit a continuum of ecological niches? Your prediction must follow logically from your assumptions. You have failed to demostrate that your prediction follows necessarily from your premises. I'm afraid that you have still not offered a prediction based on creationism.\n \n \n \nIt was discussed that Sir Fred Hoyle calculated the probability of the simplest forms of life coming about by chance at 10^40,000. 10^50 is generally considered the range of mathmatical impossibility.\n\n Off topic. You are already very confused with the topic at hand -- I would advise against increasing the number of topics until we get the ones we are discussing settled.",

   "Hello Gup20 \n As far as I can the link you gave does not really support your claims about different species in different enviroments looking at this link \n http://www.cs.unc.edu/~plaisted/ce/humanity.html \n it provides an argument that humanity and other organisms have only been reproducing for 6000 years. Has anyone got anything that would dipute (or support) his claims.\n\n \n I had a quick read over that article and noticed a couple of things.\n \n It makes only one assertion that homo sapiens is ~6000 years old, based upon mutation rates in mitochondrial DNA:\n \n \nRecently, mitochondrial DNA mutation rates were measured directly (Parsons, Thomas J., et al., A high observed substitution rate in the human mitochondrial DNA control region, Nature Genetics vol. 15, April 1997, pp. 363-367). The mutation rate in a segment of the control region of mitochondrial DNA was directly measured by comparing mitochondrial DNA from siblings and from parents and their offspring. Mitochondrial DNA was found to mutate about 20 times faster than previously thought, at a rate of one mutation (substitution) every 33 generations, approximately. In this section of the control region, which has about 610 base pairs, humans typically differ from one another by about 18 mutations. By simple mathematics, it follows that the human race is about 300 generations old. If one assumes a typical generation is about 20 years, this gives an age of about 6000 years.\n \n This calculation is done in the following way. Let us consider two randomly chosen human beings, assuming all human beings initially have identical mitochondrial DNA. After 33 generations, two such random humans will probably differ by two mutations, since there will be two separate lines of inheritance and probably one mutation along each line. After 66 generations, two randomly chosen humans will differ by about four mutations. After 100 generations, they will differ by about six mutations. After 300 generations, they will differ by about 18 mutations, which is about the observed value.\n\n \n Note the bold I added. Without this assumption, the house of cards this arguement is collapses. We don't know that all humans 6000 years ago had identical mitochondrial DNA. Its an Adam and Eve arguement in everything but name.\n \n The only other hard data they offer is regarding \"uniformity among human males in the Y chromosome\". They state the age inferences here suggest an age for our species of 20000-40000 years. What? thats out about an order of magnitude on their 6000 years from their previous \"calculation\".",

   "Has anyone got anything that would dipute (or support) his claims.\n\n Hello, Close_slave_can.\n \n I did find one answer to this claim. This claim is based on a single paper that finds that the mutation rate of a control region of the mitochondrial DNA is much higher than is expected. However, other studies show that the mutation rate is highly variable among various populations -- I didn't look at any of the references to see how variable it is. At any rate, it would appear to be a bit dodgy to use this particular gene for timing the molecular clock.\n \n I should also add that trying to use just a single gene for this kind of study seems to beg for inaccuracies. It is always better to use a much large data set, and see the use of several genes presents a consistent picture.",

Strangely, we were all brainwash victims, seeing everything through evilutionist goggles, yet we were by and large able to answer all questions put to us. Gup, well, didn't. Rather than answer questions put to him and admit his arguments were faulty, he jumped over here.\n \n It looks like Waxy has figured this out already",
