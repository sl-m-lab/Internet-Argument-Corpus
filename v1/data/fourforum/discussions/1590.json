Nothing that the Mars rovers find will ever contradict God's account of history.\"\n \n \n Does this guy have the same bible as me? Don't answer that better question does he have a telescope?

It defies everything. Including the bible. Genesis 1:1 in almost every bible starts with this sentence \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\"(KJV) \n \n How can anyone figure the earth was created first?
