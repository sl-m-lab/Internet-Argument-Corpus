   "This forum has been created to help you find an opponent to debate formally. Simply advertise your willingness to debate an issue. If you find a willing opponent, notify me by PM and I, as a moderator, will be happy to help both of you hammer out the parameters of the proposed debate (actual resolution wording, number of posts, etc.). I maintain a current list of your peers who frequent this forum who have expressed a willingness to judge a formal debate also. If agreement is reached on all issues, then I'll set up your thread in the Debate Room below and let the fireworks begin.\n \n Go ahead, give it a try! It is a wonderful way to put your convictions to the ultimate test.\n \n Also, if you're interested in being a judge, PM me.",
