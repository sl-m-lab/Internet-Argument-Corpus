   "The word assumption gets hurled around a lot in evolution/creation debates, rarely justifiably.\n \n First of all, it is not an assumption to interpret new evidence that correlates with a well-established theory as if it were explained by that theory.\n \n Example: the ongoing recovery and classification of hominid fossil remains. \n \n Common descent has proved itself beyond any reasonable doubt as far as pretty much all contemporary scientists are concerned. So when a new fossil is found which - yet again - correlates with the ToE by virtue of its appearance, geographical location and date, it is not an assumption to interpret that fossil as being explained by the ToE - eg, interpreting it as being related in some fashion to other extinct hominids. It is a well-founded conclusion.\n \n Analogy: There's a convicted serial killer whose MO was to bury the bodies of his victims in his garden, wrapped in newspaper. Years later the police track down some more previous addresses of his, dig up the gardens and find more bodies, each wrapped in newspapers bearing dates that correlate with the killer's residence in that domicile. Despite the lack of any forensic evidence directly linking the killer to those bodies, the authorities announce that he was responsible for their deaths. Is that an assumption, or a well-founded conclusion?\n \n What if all the bodies had been found in the communal gardens of shared accommodation, where the killer's was the only name that appeared on every tenant agreement? Would it be an assumption to pin the deaths on him, or a well-founded conclusion based on the extreme unlikelihood of an innocent man happening to share a series of houses with a series of killers who each independently employed the same MO and who each, without fail, began and ended their killing sprees to coincide with his arrival and departure?\n \n It doesn't matter if you disbelieve evolution, and it doesn't even matter if you're right: scientists are not making an assumption when they classify fossils. For them to be doing that, they would have to be arbitrarily choosing one interpretation from a range of interpretations that are equally likely given their understanding of the accumulated evidence. They aren't.\n \n Secondly, the pursuit of naturalistic explanations for phenomena does not require an assumption of the non-existence of god.\n \n Take the following equation: E = N + S\n \n Any (E)xplanation consists of (N)aturalistic and (S)upernatural components.\n \n N consists of anything that is amenable to the scientific method: testable, repeatable etc. Note that it is nothing to do with tangibility (eg gravity, inertia, statistics) nothing to do with how complete our understanding is, and nothing to do with its origin. Nothing explicitly excludes god from N. He might, for instance, be personally responsible for moving all matter in the universe as if it was subject to the force we perceive as gravity. It is the testability and consistency of observed gravitational phenomena which makes it part of N, not an assumption of non-divine origin.\n \n S contains explanations or part-explanations that are untestable. By definition, we cannot verify an explanation in S; we cannot ever know if we are right to employ it. Miraculous explanations fall into S.\n \n N is therefore the interesting part of any given explanation. If we can show that the contents of N are sufficient to explain a phenomenon to a high degree of plausibility, we have shown S to be empty, without ever, at any point, assuming it to be empty. Nor have we excluded the divine; we have merely shown that if god exists and is involved he is being consistent.",

   "I agree. Why is there a double standard? Why is it that claims of a flood can be tested, yet claims of design cannot be tested?\n\n A double standard would be the application of a different methodology to different problems. What you're questioning is the application of the same methodology to two different problems.\n \n We can test claims of a global flood because we can use our understanding of fluid dynamics, geology and so forth to make positive predictions about what we ought to see if there had been a global flood, and compare that with what we actually see - which is that there's no way a global flood could have occurred.\n \n So what about design? What positive predictions and comparisons can we make? Answer: none. This is because all possible observations could be explicable via design, especially once you factor in the 'unknowable mind of god'.\n \n Imagine a pile of sand. Is the position and shape of each grain a result of design? It could be. We can't exclude the possibility, particularly if we posit an omnipotent entity to whom such a feat would be negligable.\n \n Design is, in the end, selection from within a pool of alternatives. Whether those options all have physical presence, or some are mental abstractions with only the chosen option being realised, whether the design is evaluated as a whole or via its components or iteratively, in the end a design is just a selection of one option from many. \n \n It therefore doesn't make sense to ask whether any given thing was designed. It only makes sense to ask what was involved in its selection. At that point, it's always possible to suggest 'god', because 'god' is the catch-all. God could have been responsible for the pile of sand. Of course, that's overkill: there are simpler, more specific explanations involving wind and gravity. But what about (sigh) a pocket-watch?\n \n Paley almost had a point. We infer a watchmaker from seeing a watch not because the watch 'looks designed' but because there's no evidence that alternatives from which the watch was selected ever existed in reality to be discriminated between by non-intelligent agents. Volcanos don't spew out prototype watches; hydrodynamic sorting doesn't bring the most accurate timepieces to the surface.\n \n I realise that's a bit of a headful, but stay with it; it's important. If most of the selection process occurs in the abstract, with only the final result being reified, then we won't see evidence of 'natural' processes generating and filtering alternatives. That's why the watchmaker analogy is wrong: there's no evidence of natural processes producing alternative watch configurations and selecting between them, so we're justified in inferring that much of the process must have occurred in the abstract - hence a designer. But there's ample evidence of natural processes producing and discriminating between alternative 'designs' of living creatures. Bolting on a designer is overkill.\n \n \nScience pigeonholes God into a constrictive box, not me. Where have I ever attributed to God a limitation?

Such confusion is due in large part to the inability of scientists to communicate effectively to the general public and also to confusion among scientists themselves about how to define such an important term. When discussing evolution it is important to distinguish between the existence of evolution and various theories about the mechanism of evolution. And when referring to the existence of evolution it is important to have a clear definition in mind. What exactly do biologists mean when they say that they have observed evolution or that humans and chimps have evolved from a common ancestor?\n \n One of the most respected evolutionary biologists has defined biological evolution as follows:\n \n \"In the broadest sense, evolution is merely change, and so is all-pervasive; galaxies, languages, and political systems all evolve. Biological evolution ... is change in the properties of populations of organisms that transcend the lifetime of a single individual. The ontogeny of an individual is not considered evolution; individual organisms do not evolve. The changes in populations that are considered evolutionary are those that are inheritable via the genetic material from one generation to the next. Biological evolution may be slight or substantial; it embraces everything from slight changes in the proportion of different alleles within a population (such as those determining blood types) to the successive alterations that led from the earliest protoorganism to snails, bees, giraffes, and dandelions.\"\n \n - Douglas J.

   "Do any of these definitions of evolution credit any deities at all with the process of evolution or how man came into being?\n\n \n That's a bad question and you know it. Science cannot test the supernatural. Science, if you understood it, which has already proven to be untrue, is the study of the natural world. Deities are by definition supernatural and reside outside of the natural world. Science cannot disprove nor prove what lies outside its jurisdiction and realm of study. In the same fashion that you would not ask a psychologist to determine if the financial EVA projections are correct as that is clearly outside of their jurisdiction and realm of study, asking science to do the same thing is ridiculous. \n \n What science can disprove is the claims about what Gods have done in the natural world. The flood for example has been utterly refuted in the literal sense. That does not prove that the Abrahamic God does not exist. It just proves that the flood didn't happen in a literal way. \n \n And your logic dictates that if one does not credit, one is attempting to disprove someone else. Since Darwin in \"Origin of Species\" did not credit Wallace who actually came up with much of the theory before Darwin, your logic dictates that Darwin was trying to disprove Wallace even though they had essentially the same argument.\n \n How about for once since you joined you deal with your bad logic instead of blaming others for your failures?\n \n I'd love to see an explanation about how the study of the natural world disproves the existence of all Deities.\n \n I see you, like Marc9000 won't answer this.",

   "A double standard would be the application of a different methodology to different problems. \n\n \n I can't agree with that, that would be two completely unrelated applications. Dictionary.com says this about a double standard;\n \n \nan ethical or moral code that applies more strictly to one group than to another \n\n \n It says ~an~ ethical or moral (or scientific) code - not plural. So a double standard would be the same methodology, applied with different strictness, to different problems. Claims of the flood, claims of design, they're both from the past, and they should be compared with an identical strictness, concerning testablilty. Historical writings should mean something, science shouldn't be so arrogant that it can call for anything historical to be put on our present day table, all written history thrown out, and allow nothing but present day experimentation to determine if it's true or false. There seem to be a few claims out there that the WW2 holocaust never happened. Should we let nothing but present day scientific experimentation determine whether it did or didn't, and completely disregard what was written about it? Has science assumed a position of divinity, standing alone, and disregarding everything else? \n \n \nWhat you're questioning is the application of the same methodology to two different problems. \n\n \n No, different methodology to two very related problems, since they both happened in the past, and we can't go back and observe either one. \n \n \nWe can test claims of a global flood because we can use our understanding of fluid dynamics, geology and so forth to make positive predictions about what we ought to see if there had been a global flood, and compare that with what we actually see - which is that there's no way a global flood could have occurred. \n\n \n Why is it that we can't test the claims of evolution the same way? If we've made advances in fluid dynamics and geology that allows us to more critically examine the possibility of a worldwide flood, why can't we use the recently discovered complexities of the simplest forms of life, complete with all their associated probabilistic complexities, conditionally independent patterns, specified complexities, and mathematical odds, to more critically examine the possibility of purposelessness, godless evolution? I know the reason we don't - because atheists don't WANT to! Is that a good enough reason? \n \n \nSo what about design? What positive predictions and comparisons can we make? Answer: none. This is because all possible observations could be explicable via design, especially once you factor in the 'unknowable mind of god'. \n\n \n Equally, all possible observations can be explicable via mindless natural selection and random chance, especially once you factor in the atheist worldview. They're not kept on equal terms, as they should be. You and the others here imply that science is independent of God. That people like Stenger on the one side, and....Michael Behe for example, on the other side both include their personal opinions in their work, with actual science falling somewhere in the middle. Yet if we go to talkorigins, you know, that neutral \"mainstream scientific\" site, and search those two names, why can't we find them both referred to somewhat equally, praised somewhat equally, attacked somewhat equally? Here's what we find, 8 references to Stenger (8 lovefests with Stenger, maybe?) to 154 references to Behe. Do you think all 154 references to Behe were lovefests? Do you think ONE of them was? Or were most of them personal put-downs? \n \n \nImagine a pile of sand. Is the position and shape of each grain a result of design? It could be. We can't exclude the possibility, particularly if we posit an omnipotent entity to whom such a feat would be negligable.\n \n Design is, in the end, selection from within a pool of alternatives. Whether those options all have physical presence, or some are mental abstractions with only the chosen option being realised, whether the design is evaluated as a whole or via its components or iteratively, in the end a design is just a selection of one option from many. \n \n It therefore doesn't make sense to ask whether any given thing was designed. It only makes sense to ask what was involved in its selection. At that point, it's always possible to suggest 'god', because 'god' is the catch-all. God could have been responsible for the pile of sand. Of course, that's overkill: there are simpler, more specific explanations involving wind and gravity. But what about (sigh) a pocket-watch?\n \n Paley almost had a point. We infer a watchmaker from seeing a watch not because the watch 'looks designed' but because there's no evidence that alternatives from which the watch was selected ever existed in reality to be discriminated between by non-intelligent agents. Volcanos don't spew out prototype watches; hydrodynamic sorting doesn't bring the most accurate timepieces to the surface.\n \n I realise that's a bit of a headful, but stay with it; it's important. If most of the selection process occurs in the abstract, with only the final result being reified, then we won't see evidence of 'natural' processes generating and filtering alternatives. That's why the watchmaker analogy is wrong: there's no evidence of natural processes producing alternative watch configurations and selecting between them, so we're justified in inferring that much of the process must have occurred in the abstract - hence a designer. But there's ample evidence of natural processes producing and discriminating between alternative 'designs' of living creatures. Bolting on a designer is overkill. \n\n \n Ruling out a designer is also overkill, but it seems like you're drifting off the topic a little. I agree that the watchmaker analogy, as well as the \"tornado building a 747 from a junkyard\" are not good analogies - non living matter behaves differently than does living matter, when it comes to random processes. But when it comes to complexity, to several units working together to perform one function, there are similarities between living and non living complex units, those that are made up of a series of simpler units. \n \n But all that's not really what your OP was about. It was about the innocence of science, how it does not address, or rule out the supernatural. I want to know why the MANY best selling books like Stenger's don't anger you, or anyone else in science, enough to make you or someone take a serious, detailed exception to them? Why do posters like Electrolyte get mad at ME, when I point out the title of Stenger's book? Shouldn't he be getting mad at Stenger? Why is there NO conflict between naturalistic science & atheism? \n \n \nEvery time you say god must have done what the bible says, you limit him.\n\n \n Explain that one to me. You limit him more when you say he didn't do what the Bible says.",

   "Do any of these definitions of evolution credit any deities at all with the process of evolution or how man came into being?\n\n Yeah, any definition that says it's a scientific theory.\n \n Just how thick does a skull have to be to prevent the fact that science is incapable of making proclamations about the existence of supernatural entities from sinking in?\n \n \nI can't agree with that, that would be two completely unrelated applications.\n\n It's a double standard when different methodologies are applied to two different cases that fall into the same category. However, this doesn't apply when the only category the two different cases have in common is ridiculously broad. The \"They happened in the past!\" line is old, tired, and just plain dumb; it's a category that's not just stupidly huge, it's all inclusive.\n \n \nDictionary.com says this about a double standard; ...\n \n It says ~an~ ethical or moral (or scientific) code - not plural.\n\n I like how we use the dictionary to try to prove our point, and then change the dictionary definition at will.\n \n \n... why can't we use the recently discovered complexities of the simplest forms of life, complete with all their associated probabilistic complexities, conditionally independent patterns, specified complexities, and mathematical odds, to more critically examine the possibility of purposelessness, godless evolution? I know the reason we don't - because atheists don't WANT to! Is that a good enough reason?\n \n You lie. My degree is in biochemistry. Do you think I just overlooked the complexities? Within the complexities lies some great evidence for evolution... like, say, homology of the TTSS and the bacterial flagellum, which is the poster child for ID.\n \n \nYet if we go to talkorigins, you know, that neutral \"mainstream scientific\" site, and search those two names, why can't we find them both referred to somewhat equally, praised somewhat equally, attacked somewhat equally? Here's what we find, 8 references to Stenger (8 lovefests with Stenger, maybe?) to 154 references to Behe. Do you think all 154 references to Behe were lovefests?\n\n Hey marc, how about you post those eight \"lovefests\"? Or are you just lying again?\n \n \nRuling out a designer is also overkill\n\n But there's no evidence for a designer. Why should we believe in one? Have you come up with any test for design that will not produce false positives? Well? We're waiting, marc...\n \n \nWhy do posters like Electrolyte get mad at ME, when I point out the title of Stenger's book?\n\n I nailed you for misrepresenting his book, Holmes. You said that Stenger argued against all concepts of God when he doesn't. Another way to look at this is that you lied.\n \n \nWhy is there NO conflict between naturalistic science & atheism?\n\n Why is there NO conflict between science and Buddhism? science and Taoism? Is it because there's an evil Taoist conspiracy that's out to exterminate Christianity on this planet? You've totally convinced me, marc. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nYou limit him more when you say he didn't do what the Bible says.\n\n So when I make no claims whatsoever, I'm limiting God? Explain that one to me.\n \n \nAnd I posted multiple definitions of the biological science of evolution from a source you can't refute or reject as accurate and you say, and I quote, That's a bad question and you know it.\n\n Hey, Archie?

Well that is a totally fallacious argument.\n\n Yeah? Which fallacy does it commit?\n \n \nEspecially since every atheist alive can neither prove nor disprove God exists, yet they insist He doesn't exist as a life mission just about.\n\n Then they're not using a scientific argument but a philosophical one. Frankly, I don't believe in gremlins because there's no evidence for them, but you don't accuse me of being a hateful heathen for that.\n We're both atheists, Professor QM. You disbelieve tens of thousands of gods. I just believe in one fewer than you do.\n \n \nEvolution rejects that God played any part in our creation at every level of what it teaches.\n\n I think we've made it clear that you don't know a damn thing about what evolutionary theory actually says. So, here's yet another \"take your pick moment\": either you don't know that the theory says nothing of the sort, or you do know and are purposely lying about it.\n \n \nThe very term NATURAL SELECTION denies a CREATOR played any part in our origins.\n\n No, Sherlock, it doesn't.\n \n \nWhat is it about THE PROCESS OF NATURAL SELECTION THROUGH RANDOM MUTATION THAT PROMOTES, OR ALLOWS FOR THE BELIEF OF AN INTELLIGENT CREATOR AT ALL IN YOUR OPINION?\n\n The lack of any scientific claim to the contrary? The lack of any contradictory evidence? The lack of incoherency caused by the existence of such a being?\n \n Of course, basic logic says that if there's no evidence for gremlins, don't believe in them.

   "It says ~an~ ethical or moral (or scientific) code - not plural. So a double standard would be the same methodology, applied with different strictness, to different problems.\n\n Ok, I can go along with that. It's pretty much what I was aiming at anyway.\n \n \nClaims of the flood, claims of design, they're both from the past,\n\n Ye-esss... but one tenuous and very general similarity regarding the period of time to which they speak does not make them equivalent logical claims.\n \nand they should be compared with an identical strictness, concerning testablilty. Historical writings should mean something, science shouldn't be so arrogant that it can call for anything historical to be put on our present day table, all written history thrown out, and allow nothing but present day experimentation to determine if it's true or false.\n\n I prefer the term old to historical :)\n \n But seriously, biblical descriptions of the flood do mean something and they are on the table; they're the only reason anyone's even bothering to investigate the possibility. And they don't remotely tally with any physical evidence. So now we have a choice: is the biblical story accurate and all our carefully-checked and laboriously-constructed scientific understanding about what ought to happen in a global flood wrong, or is the biblical story over-egging the pudding a bit? \n \n \nThere seem to be a few claims out there that the WW2 holocaust never happened. Should we let nothing but present day scientific experimentation determine whether it did or didn't, and completely disregard what was written about it?\n\n An emotive but irrelevant question. Since there are no scientific tests I'm aware of that could even in principle evaluate the truth of the matter one way or the other, what are your grounds for suggesting such a contretemps might come to pass?\n \n \nNo, different methodology to two very related problems, since they both happened in the past, and we can't go back and observe either one. \n\n And there, from a logical perspective, the similarity ends. It's very, very simple: one statement is positive (a flood happened) while the other is negative (evolution can't have happened via natural processes)\n \n You are, understandably, going to protest that we can phrase both claims positively: \"life was designed\". However, if you go back and read my little discourse on design further up, you can see that to claim life was designed is effectively to assert that some of the selection process occurred in the abstract rather than via natural processes. And since our definition of 'natural processes' includes anything testable, anything amenable to science, it follows that this 'abstract' or 'god' cannot be directly tested. We cannot check to see if god exists (positive claim) we can only test to see whether naturalistic explanations are insufficient (negative claim).\n That, we are already doing. All creation science does is jog alongside yelling \"We still don't know everything!\" It can't, by its own definition, contribute anything positive.\n \nWhy is it that we can't test the claims of evolution the same way? If we've made advances in fluid dynamics and geology that allows us to more critically examine the possibility of a worldwide flood, why can't we use the recently discovered complexities of the simplest forms of life, complete with all their associated probabilistic complexities, conditionally independent patterns, specified complexities, and mathematical odds, to more critically examine the possibility of purposelessness, godless evolution?\n\n We can and do, because we're interested in understanding what's really going on.\n \n Look at it this way for a moment: science looks for naturalistic explanations for phenomena, right? And it has peer review and a requirement for reproducible results to ensure those explanations aren't just made up, right?\n \n So if the creation hypothesis is correct, we'll hit something we can't find an explanation for, no matter how hard we try, right?\n \n Ok, now let's see what Creation Science buys us. Here we have some guys dilligently trying not to find naturalistic explanations for phenomena. They can be right, or they can be wrong. If they're right, then regular science won't find an answer even if we aren't listening to them. If they're wrong and we do listen to them, we won't find an answer even though one exists.\n \n The only way we can lose is to listen to them.\n \nI know the reason we don't - because atheists don't WANT to! Is that a good enough reason? \n\n It seems to be good enough for you :)\n \n \nEqually, all possible observations can be explicable via mindless natural selection and random chance,\n\n No, they can't. Any number of observations could falsify evolutionary theory, and we haven't seen any of them yet.\n \n \nYet if we go to talkorigins, you know, that neutral \"mainstream scientific\" site, and search those two names, why can't we find them both referred to somewhat equally, praised somewhat equally, attacked somewhat equally? Here's what we find, 8 references to Stenger (8 lovefests with Stenger, maybe?) to 154 references to Behe. Do you think all 154 references to Behe were lovefests? Do you think ONE of them was? Or were most of them personal put-downs? \n\n I still don't understand the relevance of this book by Stenger - describing his conclusions - in a thread concerning assumptions.\n \n \nRuling out a designer is also overkill,\n\n You can't rule out a designer, that's the whole point. All you can do is show that one isn't necessary.\n \nBut all that's not really what your OP was about. It was about the innocence of science, how it does not address, or rule out the supernatural.\n\n It doesn't. If something is amenable to science, it's natural. Like I said, any phenomenon could in reality be directly divine - so long as god's consistent, the phenomenon is classed as natural.\n \nWhy is there NO conflict between naturalistic science & atheism? \n\n Same reason there's no conflict beween naturalistic science and theism - they don't overlap.\n \n What you're confusing, Marc - what every theistic opponent of what science has to say regarding evolution confuses - is the existence of god with you being right. God can exist and you can still be wrong about all the little details you believe are tied up with him. Here, let me show you what I mean:\n \n I'm an atheist. Still, I'm prepared to admit I might be completely wrong about the existence of a god, a supreme being.\n You're a Christian. Are you prepared to admit that you might be right about the existence of god, but wrong about evolution?\n \n See? The existence or non-existence of god isn't the issue at all. What you care about is being right.\n \n That's both the strength and weakness of religious dogma: it's strong and durable because it proclaims itself to be the word of god, but it's also vulnerable because once you've made that claim, you're exposed on a lot of fronts concerning which ancient people were pretty ignorant. You find yourself having to defend something preposterous like six day creation because you've bet the farm on everything being true. More than that, you constantly compound your own inflexibility by vocally deriding science for changing its mind so much in the light of new evidence - so now you can't backpedal and do the same. You end up trying to swim with millstones around your neck.\n \n \nExplain that one to me. You limit him more when you say he didn't do what the Bible says.\n\n You think?\n \n How many possibilities for god's actions in the past do you eliminate if you insist the bible is true? And how many do you eliminate if you show it to be false? If I say I went out for a meal last night and then to the cinema, do I limit my historical actions more or less than if I say I didn't go out for a meal and then to the cinema?

So, I challenge you to support your claim with evidence.\n \n \nIf so refute it with facts rather than just continuing to insist that I am wrong and you are right.\n\n How can I prove a negative? Do you want me to list the textbooks I have that discuss evolution but say nothing about any necessary disconnect with supernatural intervention? You are making the positive claim against an authority on this subject, so you need to produce the evidence.\n \n \nIt denies the participation of a SUPREME BEING in any way of being responsible for the existence of any life on Earth at all, be it plant or animal.\n\n This seems to be the loop we're stuck in:Archie: Two plus two is green!\n elec: No, two plus two is four. Arithmetic says nothing about color.\n Archie: Two plus two is green!\n elec: No, two plus two is four. Arithmetic says nothing about color.\n Archie: Two plus two is green!\n elec: No, two plus two is four. Arithmetic says nothing about color.\n Archie: Look, I can't say it any more clearly! Two plus two is green!\n elec: No, two plus two is four. Arithmetic says nothing about color.\n \nHere's the definition of Natural Selection and Random Mutation. Do they allow for an intelligent designer or creator at all? Or for all life to exist through NATURAL PROCESSES. Evolution doesn't have to actually SAY that God doesn't exist in order to imply and teach it according to its very definition. ...\n \n Now show me where God is allowed for in the description of the process by which evolution defines itself?\n\n Here's the definition for gravity:(1): the gravitational attraction of the mass of the earth, the moon, or a planet for bodies at or near its surface (2): a fundamental physical force that is responsible for interactions which occur because of mass between particles, between aggregations of matter (as stars and planets), and between particles (as photons) and aggregations of matter, that is 10^-39 times the strength of the strong force, and that extends over infinite distances but is dominant over macroscopic distances especially between aggregations of matter -called also gravitation, gravitational force\nNow, how does a \"fundamental\" force allow for a God? Clearly, it doesn't. The ploy to teach gravity in schools is an evil, anti-theistic push to eliminate Christianity and oppress the righteous. We must quell this tragedy before too many innocent children are corrupted by this crooked agenda. Soon, our brothers will be introducing Intelligent Falling bills in the state legislatures so that we can return science education in this country to the Stone Age. Viva la ignorancia!\n \n \nThat is all I'm saying and what i am saying is undeniable to any objective observer.\n\n Seriously now, Professor QM, this is the same thing. I love parody, because it can be an incredibly effective counterargument. And what I am saying is undeniable to any objective observer... emoticon_rolleyes",

   "An emotive but irrelevant question. Since there are no scientific tests I'm aware of that could even in principle evaluate the truth of the matter one way or the other, what are your grounds for suggesting such a contretemps might come to pass? \n\n \n There are all kinds of tests that could be performed to present evidence, both for and against claims of the holocaust, archeological testing in the areas where it was described to have taken place, genealogical testing of the people involved, etc. If there is no scientific way to test that, there certainly couldn't be any scientific way to test if there was a flood thousands of years ago. My grounds for suggesting that coming to pass is that it would have political and philosophical applications, just like the Biblical flood or other Biblical events. \n \n \n \nAnd there, from a logical perspective, the similarity ends. It's very, very simple: one statement is positive (a flood happened) while the other is negative (evolution can't have happened via natural processes)\n \n You are, understandably, going to protest that we can phrase both claims positively: \"life was designed\". However, if you go back and read my little discourse on design further up, you can see that to claim life was designed is effectively to assert that some of the selection process occurred in the abstract rather than via natural processes. And since our definition of 'natural processes' includes anything testable, anything amenable to science, it follows that this 'abstract' or 'god' cannot be directly tested. We cannot check to see if god exists (positive claim) we can only test to see whether naturalistic explanations are insufficient (negative claim).\n That, we are already doing. All creation science does is jog alongside yelling \"We still don't know everything!\" It can't, by its own definition, contribute anything positive. \n\n \n But since naturalism can't fill all the gaps, it does what it you're accusing ID of - it makes abstract assumptions, that life arose from non-living substances naturally. It does exactly what you accuse creation science of doing, it yells \"We still don't know everything\". The contributions are equal, from both worldviews. Searching for LACK of desigh contributes equally to a society as does searching FOR design. \n \n \n \nWe can and do, because we're interested in understanding what's really going on.\n \n Look at it this way for a moment: science looks for naturalistic explanations for phenomena, right? And it has peer review and a requirement for reproducible results to ensure those explanations aren't just made up, right?[\n \n So if the creation hypothesis is correct, we'll hit something we can't find an explanation for, no matter how hard we try, right? \n\n \n Yes, and you have, you can't find an explanation for the beginning of life. \n \n \nOk, now let's see what Creation Science buys us. Here we have some guys dilligently trying not to find naturalistic explanations for phenomena. \n\n \n It's not fair to classify them that way. They are trying to study, with natural human limitations, how naturalism and the supernatural can be seen together. When it comes to guys dilligently trying NOT to find something, that designation goes to evolutionists, who refuse to consider ID. ID is not a designer search, it is a design search. There is a big difference. \n \n \n \nThey can be right, or they can be wrong. If they're right, then regular science won't find an answer even if we aren't listening to them. \n\n \n Check, so far that ones paning out pretty predictibly. \n \n \nIf they're wrong and we do listen to them, we won't find an answer even though one exists. \n\n \n Listening to them doesn't mean abandoning other ideas. It doesn't mean that godless evolution studies will be forbidden by the courts, in the public arena concerning funding and education. \n \n \nI still don't understand the relevance of this book by Stenger - describing his conclusions - in a thread concerning assumptions. \n\n \n His conclusions are a result of his assumptions. He's shouting his very opinionated conclusions from the rooftops, and millions of impressionable minds are listening. Mainstream science winks and nods - it doesn't take exception to THIS side of scientific assumption, but it takes strong exception to the OTHER SIDE of scientific assumption, that there may be evidence for design. \n \n \nYou can't rule out a designer, that's the whole point. All you can do is show that one isn't necessary. \n\n \n Why is there a desire to show that one isn't necessary? \n \n \nSame reason there's no conflict beween naturalistic science and theism - they don't overlap. \n\n \n Not according to Stenger and Dawkins. If there's no conflict between naturalistic science and theism, then there should be plenty of conflict between naturalistic science and Stenger/Dawkins. We don't see it. We just see winks and nods. \n \n \nWhat you're confusing, Marc - what every theistic opponent of what science has to say regarding evolution confuses - is the existence of god with you being right. God can exist and you can still be wrong about all the little details you believe are tied up with him. Here, let me show you what I mean:\n \n I'm an atheist. Still, I'm prepared to admit I might be completely wrong about the existence of a god, a supreme being.\n You're a Christian. Are you prepared to admit that you might be right about the existence of god, but wrong about evolution?\n \n See? The existence or non-existence of god isn't the issue at all. What you care about is being right.\n\n \n Those were two different questions. But I'm not as concerned about being right myself as I am with people in authority being wrong, and falsely teaching future generations to be wrong. I know you'll say that goes both ways. The difference is, mainstream science seeks to block ID legally. Representatives of ID don't indicate that they intend to legally block mainstream scientific evolution studies. Future generations should have a choice. \n \n \nThat's both the strength and weakness of religious dogma: it's strong and durable because it proclaims itself to be the word of god, but it's also vulnerable because once you've made that claim, you're exposed on a lot of fronts concerning which ancient people were pretty ignorant. You find yourself having to defend something preposterous like six day creation because you've bet the farm on everything being true. More than that, you constantly compound your own inflexibility by vocally deriding science for changing its mind so much in the light of new evidence - so now you can't backpedal and do the same. You end up trying to swim with millstones around your neck. \n\n \n Science changes it's mind in small ways, but its millstones, its inflexibility always shows up in its constant adoration of Darwin. \n \n \n \nYou think?\n \n How many possibilities for god's actions in the past do you eliminate if you insist the bible is true? And how many do you eliminate if you show it to be false? If I say I went out for a meal last night and then to the cinema, do I limit my historical actions more or less than if I say I didn't go out for a meal and then to the cinema? Think about that for a bit.\n\n \n You may have a point if all we were concerned with were God's actions of the past. But Christianity is largely about the present, and the future. The Bible says that God is eternal, unchangeable, omnipresent, omniscient, perfect, incomprehensible, holy, and good. If that's true, then the possiblities for his actions in the future would be pretty impressive, wouldn't they? Yet if what he said about his creation is false, maybe it would imply that his other attributes I referred to above could also be called into question.",

   "If He did then why does Genesis give a completely different account of how we got here?\n\n \n For the same reason that Genesis gives a different account of everything else. Explaining how things actually worked to people who don't understand the basics of it is stupid. I already gave examples of this before. You don't start explaining things to people who don't understand at a complex level. You are proof of this. We have failed because we tried to discuss evolution and science with you, who can't even figure out what theory actually means. In the same fashion, trying to explain an old Earth to nomads is idiotic and futile. \n \n \nOne that claims He personally created us in His image? You never considered that one huh?\n\n \n Not a problem. Your logical skills are bad and hence you didn't think I already had an answer. Unfortunately I already had the answer to this problem at least two years ago, maybe longer. God is assumed and believed to exist out side of time. Therefore God knows what will be and what has happened before it created matter. Therefore, God knows what species will arise. Furthermore, since God is inherently incorporeal and has the ability to assume any form it so wishes, having the mechanism it created to produce species that it could fathom before creation doesn't result in any contradiction. \n \n \nAnd what is at all similar about the ToE and the Creation account?\n\n \n Which Creation account? Literal? Figurative? Which story? \n \n \nHow do they mesh in any way?\n\n \n If you take them figuratively, I don't see any problems. Literal you start running into a huge problems, and not just with evolution. Basic hydrology that is used by the Army Corp of Engineers and local water municipalities in managing water aquifers for use must be thrown out despite it being proven to be true for at least a hundred years. While it is true that some of radiology is based on assumptions, and these assumptions are based on a very old Earth and Universe, the same radiology is used to power nuclear reactors. If such assumptions were indeed false, that creates a problem of how such a field of study could have such massive problems yet use the same problem riddled methods to produce practical, tangible results. Pragmatism and commercial application largely prove much of the science based on old earth assumptions to be true. One of the major failings of creationists claims in my opinion is that there are no practical applications based on the so called 'science' of creation. If something was indeed true, one would be able to apply it to real world settings. Old Earth Geology is used by the oil industry. Old Earth hydrology by local municipalities. Evolutionary biology by big pharmaceuticals. The same methods used by biologists studying evolution are the same used in criminal forensics cases. As opposed to nothing by YEC 'science.' \n \n \nDoesn't the 4 billion year old Earth that evolution rests its hat on conflict with the Creation account also?\n\n \n Evolution and the old Earth, (which are not dependent by the way) has relatively little to do with literal Creationism on its own. The existence of creation has no impact upon the actual truth of evolution. Evolution is never argued to be true on the basis of Creationism's wrongness, where Creationism is rarely argued to be true on the basis of its merits. \n \n \nSo in what way again was this all Gods idea?\n\n \n I don't speak for God and neither should you. However, it is possible that evolution is merely a tool of God. Deism actually requires evolution (or something similar) as the Deistic set of Gods are not present and do not interfere.",

Pathetic.\n \n \nIf there is no scientific way to test that, there certainly couldn't be any scientific way to test if there was a flood thousands of years ago.\n\n Non-sequitur. There are plenty of ways to test claims of a global flood. My personal favorite is the pressure and temperature changes that would occur upon the removal of that much water from the atmosphere.

   "Originally Posted by Stenger's book's front flap \n In God: The Failed Hypothesis, Stenger argues that science has advanced sufficiently to make a definitive statement on the existence -- or nonexistence -- of the traditional Judeo-Christian-Islamic God. \n Quite frankly, I think THIS is part of the problem that some Christians really have with science.\n If you take the ENTIRE bible literally, and it's an \"all or nothing\" deal where all of the bible has to be true or there is no god, then science has destroyed those specific religions.\n \n 1) Those religions make explicit claims regarding the age of the earth and life upon it, which are definitively (and incontrovertibly to anybody who doesn't act blind and deaf) wrong.\n \n 2) Those religions make explicit claims regarding some historic events, like the flood or god \"stopping the sun in the sky\". Also proven wrong by science.\n (And amusingly enough, the issue came up when religion attempted to USE science to prove them right...)\n \n And instead of addressing the ISSUES INVOLVED, typically what we see is a pointless attempt to attack science itself.\n \n =========================================================\n \n Furthermore Archie, I noticed that you completely dropped discussion on my points showing evolution does not preclude the existence of A god.\n You tried to misrepresent other people's positions, but in the end you were left with nothing.\n \n But you're STILL going to run around claiming that evolution precludes the existence of God, aren't you... emoticon_rolleyes",

Here it is: http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=304089&postcount=77 And here is your response to mine. http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=304124&postcount=78 So the question is; why so defensive lyte? Why the attacks and insults, the attempt at degradation and mockery when I posted my argument in such a non aggressive, low key way? What deep intellectual insecurity are you over compensating for? Maybe it's time for some serious introspection on your part.\n \n And are you so insecure in your own intelligence that you must attempt to intimidate the opposition by trying to make them feel inadequate? Well let me tell you; it doesn't work with me. It just perpetuates the bad blood that you so consistently nurture with your hateful and denigrating responses.\n \n \nRight on the front flap, found in the link you posted yourself to try to show that your buddy marc was right, is the proof that he is wrong.It can't be much more clear.\n A reviewer who read the book says that it only addresses the Judeo-Christian God.\n trebor pointed out that it doesn't aim to disprove an all-inclusive concept of a deity.\n The book jacket itself explains that it addresses only the Judeo-Christian God.\n\n \n Just 2 points to make in response to this drivel. \n \n 1) It isn't a reviewer who writes what's on the inside flaps of the book jacket, it's the Publisher outlining what the book promises to deliver. I would expect a College Graduate and an alleged school teacher to know such an obvious thing. \n \n And 2) In your debate with marc about your denial that this book attempted to disprove the existence of God, your claim that the concept of the Judeo Christian God being the sole focus of Stengler was wrong, as was Trebors claim. Only now that I have proven you wrong are you getting picky as to any particular God being referenced. In other words moving the goal posts and redefining the debate in order to try to save yourself. And beside that, this statement in the book flap which I posted in my last post refers to any creator, not just the Judeo Christian God, see? Stenger's book description say's, and I quote: Human endeavors fail to demonstrate the existence of a divine creator. He convincingly shows that not only is there no evidence for God, but scientific observations actually point to His nonexistence. \n \n So your claim that the Judeo Christian God is his only target is fallacious. Because right here where the statement is made, http://www.amazon.com/gp/sitbv3/reader?ie=UTF8&p=S00N&asin=1591024811 he say's, and I quote: or, at least, some being with supernatural powers. So could his intentions be any more generic as to his belief in no supreme being of any name at all?\n \n So you go on and keep boasting and proclaiming victory as you redefine the debate to try to disguise your errors. I just have to post the truth and the links that support it and those who read these debates can make up their own minds. No matter how many times you try to cover your personal insecurities by implying my ignorance.\n \n FRONT FLAP: http://www.amazon.com/gp/sitbv3/reader?ie=UTF8&p=S002&asin=1591024811\n \n BACK FLAP: http://www.amazon.com/gp/sitbv3/reader?ie=UTF8&p=S089&asin=1591024811\n Now for electrolytes original claim which he is now redefining which some would call totally dishonest.\n  [electrolyte post #74]\n Stenger and Dawkins use science to argue against specific conceptualizations of gods. \n You know what else is very interesting electrolyte?

Zannelli (Ocala FL USA) - See all my reviewsStenger's book is a devastating critique of the historical and current attempts to justify the existence of the traditional Judeo-Christian-Islamic God.\nsource\n \nAnd 2) In your debate with marc about your denial that this book attempted to disprove the existence of God, your claim that the concept of the Judeo Christian God being the sole focus of Stengler was wrong, as was Trebors claim. ... Stenger's book description say's, and I quote: Human endeavors fail to demonstrate the existence of a divine creator. He convincingly shows that not only is there no evidence for God, but scientific observations actually point to His nonexistence.\n\n If I worded my statement as if the Judeo-Christian God was the \"sole\" conceptualization, I should not have. It is accurate, however, to say that Stenger's claim is that science disproves the specific version of God espoused by Judeo-Christian beliefs.Right on the front flap, found in the link you posted yourself to try to show that your buddy marc was right, is the proof that he is wrong.\n In God: The Failed Hypothesis, Stenger argues that science has advanced sufficiently to make a definitive statement on the existence -- or nonexistence -- of the traditional Judeo-Christian-Islamic God. [bold added]\n\n It can't be much more clear.\n\n In doing so, Stenger also uses other more inclusive counters against generic arguments for the existence of a god. This in no way disproves the existence of all Gods. See below.\n \n \nBecause right here where the statement is made, ([link]) he say's, and I quote: or, at least, some being with supernatural powers. So could his intentions be any more generic as to his belief in no supreme being of any name at all?\n\n How about you stop with the quote mining? You didn't even get through one paragraph. Look at the next page. He specifically uses traditionally Christian conceptualizations of God in order to refute specific arguments. Go ahead, look on the next page. You can read, can't you, Archie? So why do you refuse to acknowledge what it says right there in black and white? Here, I'll help:... However, as he and others have pointed out, such a deity would not be a perfectly loving God and the very existence of nonbelievers in the world who have not resisted such belief is evidence against his existence. The problem of divine hiddenness is one that has taxed the abilities of theologians over the years -- almost as much as the problem of evil, which questions how an onmibenevolent, omnipotent, and omniscient God can allow so much unnecessary suffering among the planet's humans and animals. [bold added]\nThese characteristics are commonly attributed to some gods but are consistently attributed to the Judeo-Christian God. In fact, some of the counterarguments do not work without assuming these traditionally Judeo-Christian characteristics apply.\n \n \nSo you go on and keep boasting and proclaiming victory as you redefine the debate to try to disguise your errors. I just have to post the truth and the links that support it and those who read these debates can make up their own minds. No matter how many times you try to cover your personal insecurities by implying my ignorance.\n\n One will note that I just used Archie's links to show that his own links show him to be dead wrong and me to be vindicated. The main aim of Stenger's book is to deny the existence of the Judeo-Christian God. He uses characteristics of the Judeo-Christian God to counter arguments for the existence of such a deity and to forward arguments against the existence of such a deity. And all of this information was readily available had Archie chosen to finish reading anything but the tiniest snippet of the book. Despite the fact that Archie has repeated his assertion that the book jacket supports his claim, I have now posted multiple times the quote from the very same link that Archie had to read in order to find his citation that shows that he is wrong.\n You're right, Archie. I don't have to highlight your ignorance. You do it yourself more effectively than I possibly can. \n \n \nMy front and back flap links work perfectly in my original post that I used them in; and we all know that when one uses the quote button to forward a post to respond to, that all links also forward perfectly. Yet, if anyone clicks on this link of your post which quoted my links to the front and back flaps of Stenglers book, strangely enough, the links don't work.\n [copy of broken link] Why is that, electrolyte? If you trust what you contend to be true with such confidence, why would you disable, yet post the links so they appear to be available as evidence but are actually useless for the readers confirmation of what you claim? I will leave it up to the readers to decide what makes more sense, what you say, or what you do.\n\n Well, it could be part of some huge conspiracy to discredit you, Archie. Perhaps I was planning to draw out this debate, then come back and stupidly claim that your link didn't work (even though I clearly followed it in order to find the very sentence you still claim doesn't exist) so that I could open the door to you calling me a liar all over again. After all, that's the m.o. of the evil atheist conspiracy when it's not plotting to murder you and your children as you sit peacefully in church praying for peace. Really, I just couldn't resist giving you fodder to impeach my integrity on extremely flimsy evidence and go nuts about how dishonest and backhanded my tactics are.\n Or, I copied and pasted directly from the thread display, kind of like I've done here, knowing that the original links in your posts exist for all to see and follow. I'll let the readers decide which they think is more likely. emoticon_rolleyes",

I just thought you might take the advice to stop arguing a point that is clearly and indisputably false. You somewhat have, in part at least because I made it so painfully clear to you.

But if that is acceptable to you, in order to feel good about yourself, then that's fine with me. I'll let the objective observer decide who's telling the truth and who's manipulating the truth by going back and reading our posts in order and in proper context. You see, I welcome such scrutiny while you must fear it. My post 82, and your post 84 are very revealing in showing how you twist and reinterpret what I said in order to claim a false victory.\n \n \nYou're right, Archie.

   "Though electrolyte hardly needs help, I'll de-lurk for a while\n \n \nit's that although Stengler focussed on disproving the Judeo Christian God spefically, his goal was to prove that any Supreme Being exists in general.\n\n \n I'm guessing you asked him? If not you're talking BS... Just because you think that without YWH and Jesus there is no God, don't assume the rest of the world agrees. Disproving literal elements of the Bible does not affect Thor or Odin or Shiva or the FSM u.s.w. It also does nothing to affect a non-literal Abrahamic God.\n \n \nEspecially since you claim to be a school teacher with a degree. The only degree you have I suspect, is in BS.\n\n \n Whose throwing out the ad homs?\n \n \nThe reason Stengler concentrates on the Judeo Christian God is because He is the one true and living God.\n\n \n See above. The reason that Stengler concentrates on the Abrahamic God is that, thanks to the Romans, it's the most widespread religion in Europe, and through us, the world...\n \n \nAnd the enemy of all truth hates Him.\n\n \n Do you have nightmares trying to reconcile the fact that for God to have created Satan he must have had an evil side to him?\n \n \ncults like hinduism, buddhism, and even islam with their radical butchers aren't seen as the same threat as Christians are by todays World System.\n\n \n Anyone else get the hint that AA's conspiracy theory generator is being given an extra couple of cranks? There are tens of millions of Hindus, possibly billions of Buddhists (depending what you believe about China) and there are definately tens of millions of Muslims (maybe hundreds) so they're a little more than just cults... The current state of the world would suggest that Islam is viewed as a more immediate threat than Evangelicals... (Or could that be because they were chosen by the Evangelicals??????emoticon_ic ) \n \n \nOK, now I must insist that you post the specific quote that I have mined!\n\n \n If you insist....\n \nas he clearly was attacking the generic belief in any supreme being as shown by this statement, and I quote: or, at least, some being with supernatural powers.\n\n Original Quote:\nMany theologians and theistic scientists claim that evidence has been found for the existence of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God, or at least, some being with super-natural powers. However, they cannot deny that their evidence is not sufficiently convincing to satisfy the majority of scientists.\n\n \n When you change what's said by quoting out of context that's called quote mining....\n \n \nAhhh, another unsupported ad hom attack. Thanks for making my point.\n\n \n It's not really an ad hom. He didn't attack your character to disprove your argument. He merely pointed out that you do a damn good job of making your argument look silly...",

   "The only one who ends up looking ignorant in the end is you Lyte.\nThough electrolyte hardly needs help...\nemoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nEspecially since you claim to be a school teacher with a degree. The only degree you have I suspect, is in BS.\n\n Well, I do have a Bachelor of Science degree in an actual science... Where's yours?\n \n \nWOW, you are incredibly dishonest and yet you seem to be proud of yourself for it. This is what you said in your last post that I responded to in red below. You said this, and I quote you: Right on the front flap, found in the link you posted yourself [snip] A reviewer who read the book says... \n\n You know, Archie, you leave me little choice. The only way I can explain your \"misinterpretation\" of my statements is either by showing that you didn't understand what I said or that you are purposely being dishonest about what I said.\n \n Take a look at the \"[snip]\" in Archie's post. Now, I don't mind snipping longer pieces and quotations that don't contain necessary context. I've done it before. But let's compare Archie's representation with what I actually posted (now for the fourth or fifth time):Right on the front flap, found in the link you posted yourself to try to show that your buddy marc was right, is the proof that he is wrong.In God: The Failed Hypothesis, Stenger argues that science has advanced sufficiently to make a definitive statement on the existence -- or nonexistence -- of the traditional Judeo-Christian-Islamic God. [bold added]\nIt can't be much more clear.\n A reviewer who read the book says that it only addresses the Judeo-Christian God.\n trebor pointed out that it doesn't aim to disprove an all-inclusive concept of a deity.\n The book jacket itself explains that it addresses only the Judeo-Christian God.\nNow, in hindsight, I realize that I didn't specify precisely what I was talking about in this post when I nailed marc on ignoring evidence that the book is not about disproving all conceptualizations of a deity. I didn't link to the book flap; no, I linked to that page because it is that specific page that has the reader review. From contextual clues and a link to only that page, it should be clear that I was not discussing the book jacket at that time.\n But look at what I said in response to Archie: I posted the book flap quotation, then recapped the evidence. I mentioned the review that I had linked in my earlier response to marc. I mentioned that trebor discussed this issue and countered marc's argument. And I repeated the fact that Archie's own link to the book jacket provided sufficient evidence to show that marc was wrong.\n Now look at how Archie is trying to paint my statements. He removed a line, then is pretending that my reference to a reviewer is intended to refer to the book jacket. But I refer to the book jacket after referring to trebor. Why would I reference A, then reference B, and then reference A again as if it were a separate piece of evidence? This makes no sense. Interpreting this in such a fashion shows a lack of understanding of basic literary structure.\n The only alternative is that Archie understands what I was saying an is lying about what was said in order to ... well, whatever we want to call whatever Archie does. Suffice it to say that it seems to me that we're left with either (a) Archie doesn't comprehend basic English very well, or (b) Archie is deliberately being dishonest.\n This is, of course, delicious given the opening to this accusation. Let's see it again:WOW, you are incredibly dishonest and yet you seem to be proud of yourself for it.\nI don't even need to take a swipe at this comedy gold.\n \n \nSo why do you do obviously dishonest things like this lyte? Do you think people can't just go back a few posts and read in context how dishonest you're being here?\n\n On the contrary: I count on people being able to go back a few posts and see that I'm guilty of none of these terrible things of which you're always accusing me.\n \n \nThat's why christianity is seen as the greatest threat to atheism, and cults like hinduism, buddhism, and even islam with their radical butchers aren't seen as the same threat as Christians are by todays World System.\n\n No, atheists in the U.S. resist the bigotry, hatred, and slander of Christians because (1) we're surrounded by them and (2) Christians do it. Atheists in Turkey resist the bigotry, hatred, and slander of Muslims because (1) they're surrounded by Muslims and (2) Muslims do it. If I were surrounded by Buddhists or Taoists or agnostics who treated me the same way, I'd lay into them, too. But you just don't see any real conflict between any of these groups and atheists, do you? Now, that could be because they're aren't so many around, or it could be because Buddhists and Taoists generally aren't bigoted, slanderous hatemongers? You make the call.\n \n \n \nSo your claim that Yahweh was his only target to disprove is again very dishonest, as he clearly was attacking the generic belief in any supreme being as shown by this statement, and I quote: or, at least, some being with supernatural powers. as confirmed here with this link: [link snipped]\n \nHow about you stop with the quote mining?\n\n OK, now I must insist that you post the specific quote that I have mined!\n\n Okay:So your claim that Yahweh was his only target to disprove is again very dishonest, as he clearly was attacking the generic belief in any supreme being as shown by this statement, and I quote: or, at least, some being with supernatural powers. as confirmed here with this link:\nArchie includes the link in his post above: be sure to follow it so that you can see the entire sentence. It's the first sentence of the book, but Archie can't even include the whole sentence.\"Many theologians and theistic scientists claim that evidence has been found for the existence of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God or, at least, some being with supernatural powers.\"Now, is that context even the slightest bit representative of how Archie presents it? Not at all.\n In fact, I've already told Archie that he needs to read even the rest of the first paragraph, but apparently that's asking too much. If he cares to read into the second and third paragraphs -- and if he has the comprehension skills of a sixth grader -- he'd see that Stenger immediately gives certain characteristics to a proposed deity in order to discuss the philosophical (not even scientific) arguments for and against the existence of such a deity.\n \n But, hey, you can lead a horse to water, but if he'd rather die of thirst...\n \n Need I even explain how Archie's quote from the book jacket is taken out of context and misrepresented when I posted the exact quote from the same book cover that refutes Archie's characterization? If Archie can read, then I shouldn't. Honestly, though, I'm not holding my breath for an, \"Oh, I see. My bad.\"\n \n \nI'll let the objective observer decide who's telling the truth and who's manipulating the truth by going back and reading our posts in order and in proper context.\n\n Says the person who accuses me of being dishonest and taking things out of context while you deliberately delete lines from my posts and remove context in order to accuse me of being dishonest? Holy sh*t man. I've never seen projection so deeply ingrained in a person.\n \n \nYou see, I welcome such scrutiny while you must fear it.\n\n I fear scrutiny, yet I include the links to the posts I'm quoting so that anyone can go back and view the entire thing with a single click? You just can't stop with the projection-induced howlers, can you?\n \n \nMy post 82, and your post 84 are very revealing in showing how you twist and reinterpret what I said in order to claim a false victory.\n\n 84 isn't my post. The author's name isn't Stengler. You can't show a single instance where I have been dishonest.\n Your post 82 gives me all the fodder I needed for my post 85, where -- in case you didn't notice -- I ripped you a new one. You just didn't understand, though, so here you are again with the same stuff, ignoring what I say, ignoring what Stenger says, ignoring what the reviewer says, posting the same quote mine again, posting the other same quote mine again...\n \n I've posted the same refutations to the same balderdash you keep posting, so unless you address something I actually say, I think we're done here. I just don't see enough evidence to believe that either (1) you're listening or (2) you have any grasp of reality.",

   "Then attack my position. Go ahead. Refute my arguments, and do it with evidence instead of bald assertions that you've come to know and love so dearly. \n\n \n When I mentioned the title of chapter \"Living in the GODLESS universe\" did you consider it a \"bald assertion\" or was it evidence? Suppose something is \"nameless\". Do you consider to have some names but not all names, or NO name? Suppose something is \"purposeless\". Do you consider it to have some purpose, or NO purpose? Do you need more examples, or would that be enough? You accept getting roasted to a crisp with about as much grace as your lil buddy obvious_child. \n \n \n \n \nOh FFS. When will you give this persecution nonsense a rest?\n I use evidence. You and Archie don't, and you ignore the evidence I give you. You just repeat the same tripe over again. Scroll up. Can you deny that it explicitly aims at the Judeo-Christian God and not at every single imaginable version of a deity? \n\n \n Already have, thanks. The words \"Judeo Christianity\" appear nowhere on the cover of the book. The book is dishonest of course - it meanders back and fourth between any god and the Judeo Christian God just enough so that your claim can be argueably made, especially with lots of needling fallacies, coupled with a gang. At the top of page 234, under the heading of \"What gods remain\", it says this in the first paragraph, which sums it pretty well;\n \n \nNow, a believer is certainly free to argue that \"none of these Gods is my god.\" I have nowhere claimed that I can rule out every conceivable god, just those with the selected empirically detectable attributes. If a believer's god does not have any of those attributes, then I have no quarrel with her. \n\n \n One thing that stands out to me, is that he referred to God as a \"her\". Wonder if that was a fallacy, or just a militant atheist taunt? Would the scientific community that loves him give him an equal break if he'd have referred to God as black, or oriental? \n \n But mainly, he doesn't have a problem with any god that has NO ATTRIBUTES. What is a god, without attributes? Answer, NOTHING. The same nothingness of atheism. \n \n \nCan you, marc? Answer the question. Use evidence if necessary.\n\n \n I hope I have. The bottom line is this - your twin summed up you and all your various helpers position in post #38;\n \n \nAs has been previously told to you, numerous times, science makes no statements regarding the existence or non-existence of the supernatural. \n\n \n On the front of the book, it says this;\n \n \nHow science shows that God does not exist. \n\n \n As I pointed out in post #5, they have to be switched back and fourth at will, depending on the argument in today's scientific environment. To question it, results in RAGE from those who represent evolution. If evolutionists have to be this tricky with this, how do we know they're not being tricky with all of evolution?",

   "When I mentioned the title of chapter \"Living in the GODLESS universe\" did you consider it a \"bald assertion\" or was it evidence?\n\n When I mentioned the boatloads of specific (Judeo-Christian) characteristics attributed to \"God\" in this book, was it bald assertion or was it evidence? I'll give you a hint: you can still go back and read the links. I don't know how I can possibly make this any clearer: the text makes it clear from the get-go that the main target is the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God. It stands to reason that this is the meaning of \"God\" that he uses throughout the book, and that view is supported by reading page 22.\n \n \nYou accept getting roasted to a crisp with about as much grace as your lil buddy obvious_child.\n\n Swing and a miss. You see, marc, in order to get roasted, one has to be wrong. If you'd just read, you'd see that I'm not.\n \n \nThe words \"Judeo Christianity\" appear nowhere on the cover of the book.\n\n Yes, folks, this is literally marc judging a book entirely by its cover. In marc's fantasyland, there's no need for actual text; we just read a title and we instantaneously know what we've for years foolishly required multiple, sometimes hundreds, sometimes thousands of pages to explain.\n Dear God... can people really be this absolutely disconnected from reality, or is it all just an act?\n \n \nThe book is dishonest of course - it meanders back and fourth between any god and the Judeo Christian God just enough so that your claim can be argueably made, especially with lots of needling fallacies, coupled with a gang.\n\n Right: the book is dishonest because it looks exactly like it's not arguing against all conceptualizations of god. Clearly, this is because it is trying to disprove all conceptualizations of god. Your evidence for this is that it looks exactly like it's not arguing against all conceptualizations of god. Therefore, the book is arguing against all conceptualizations of god.\n \n \nAt the top of page 234, under the heading of \"What gods remain\", it says this in the first paragraph, which sums it pretty well;\nNow, a believer is certainly free to argue that \"none of these Gods is my god.\" I have nowhere claimed that I can rule out every conceivable god, just those with the selected empirically detectable attributes. If a believer's god does not have any of those attributes, then I have no quarrel with her.\n\n\n And this excerpt that explicitly shows that Stenger acknowledges that he hasn't disproved all conceptualizations of gods is proof that Stenger is trying to disprove all conceptualizations of God.\n F***ing hell, it's like slamming my head against a wall.\n \n \nOne thing that stands out to me, is that he referred to God as a \"her\". Wonder if that was a fallacy, or just a militant atheist taunt?\n\n Again, how the hell can I not expose your reading comprehension when you make these bonehead comprehension mistakes. When Stenger says \"her,\" he is referring to the believer.\n \n \nWould the scientific community that loves him give him an equal break if he'd have referred to God as black, or oriental?\n\n Frankly, I wonder why it's such a huge deal, unless the bigotry is based on the clear anti-female sentiment in the Bible. In fact, I don't see why the Christian God would have a sex at all (you know, except for the part about fabricating it all for humans' selfish reasons).\n \n \nBut mainly, he doesn't have a problem with any god that has NO ATTRIBUTES.\n\n Science can't disprove a deity that doesn't have testable effects. Period. Keep your religion out of the realm of science, and you keep your religion out of the line of fire. Frankly, you can't fault science for stepping on its toes. That's like my saying that I have every right to spend time in your foyer without having to follow your house rules, accomodate your living in the house, or acknowledge your existence in any way whatsoever.\n \n \nTo question it, results in RAGE from those who represent evolution.\n\n No, marc, what is aggravating is that you and Archie apparently don't know how to read, or think, or come to grips with reality. The book says exactly what I've said it does, and you even post excerpts to that fact, and yet here you are saying that I'm wrong. I'm sorry, I just can't fix that kind of willful stupidity.",
