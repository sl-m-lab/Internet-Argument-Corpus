   "60 Minutes ran a story tonight about new brain scanning and mind reading technology. According to them - In the future, it may be possible for others (ie: the government) to read your mind without your knowledge/consent. That being the case - if you've committed any crimes - you would be tried and convicted based on this new mind reading technology. Furthermore, there may even be a Supreme Court Case regarding this technology in the future. \n \n It's pretty scary stuff, if you ask me. Furthermore (if you want my honest opinion), if this technology is ever allowed, we will truly be living in George Orwell's 1984 - I don't know if I would want to live in that world, to be honest with you. . . \n \n Any comments? \n \n ps - As my post count is not yet up to 10, I am unable to post links/videos. However, if you would like more info, you can go to cbsnews.com and click on 60 Minutes to get the full story. . .",
