I'm asking from a purely philosophical standpoint, not in terms of public policy.\n \n 1) Teachers shoulder the responsibility of educating the future generation. The quality of our future society depends on the quality of teachers. A pilot is a glorified bus driver.\n \n 2) Pilots, like doctors, are responsible for hundreds of lives as well as complex and expensive equipment and should be paid as such. There are no lives at stake while teaching algebra.",

And I believe that pilots do earn more than teachers on average, but a starting teacher earns more than a starting pilot but a pilot with a lot of seniority earns more than a teacher with the same amount of seniority. In any case, keep in mind that a pilots education costs about $50,000 more.",
