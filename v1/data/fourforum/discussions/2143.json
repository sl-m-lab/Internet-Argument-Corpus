   "Pseudo democracy leader of Georgia uses extra ordinary methods. Saakashvili announced that dollar adjustment will be attenuating circumstance for the official accused of bribery and state property misappropriation. And justice must take that fact into account when passes sentence. And the most irritating thing he said, that they withdraw funds from people who made their business during the Shevardnadze reign. So if they don't have cogent evidence they will just grab these people. Shevardnadze considers that during Shevardnadze period there were no chance to make an honest business. People that will not be able to prove that they made money in a legal way will be forced to pay it back and will also lose houses and cars for benefit of state. That is piece of democracy that was promised by Saakashvili. And it is a part of US order to make Georgia democracy for the Georgians' money. But Washington can't afford top pay for it. The only matter is Iraq.",
