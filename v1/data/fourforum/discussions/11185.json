   "I know this thread was directed to a specific person, but I hope you don't mind if I chime in.\n \n To answer the original question, why was it okay for God to kill in the Bible when we are not allowed to do so?\n My best response is this: the God of the Old Testament behaves differently from the God of the New Testament (i.e. before Jesus and after Jesus). Not because God changed, but because we did. Our understanding of God, of the universe, and of ourselves naturally evolved and grew more complex over time. Think of a parent disciplining a young child versus disciplining an older one. In the earliest years, there is merely action and consequence, disobedience and punishment. We learn not to do something because something bad happens. When God intervened in the Old Testament, he was not taking lives merely for his own convenience; it was a punishment for sin (something that still exists in our own world in the form of the death penalty, though that is another can of worms which need not be opened here).\n \n However, as we grow and age, we gain understanding. We are taught that some acts are just inherently wrong, the punishing doesn't make them so. So where the Old Testament emphasized the letter of the law, the New Testament stresses the spirit of the law and makes possible mercy. We become responsible for understanding why things are wrong and, through Jesus, are able to make reparation for our sins. Heaven becomes attainable, but hell also becomes possible (in my opinion, a much more terrifying punishment than those in the OT).\n \n There is a great deal more theology that goes into this response, but I have explained it as best I understand it. I hope it helps!",

   "Shooter, my child, neither the woman or the man is able to create the soul that makes the child a unique and sentient being.\n\n \n The law isn't, and shouldn't be based on religious ####. If I cut down a couple of trees, saw the wood into little jenga blocks, and then make a little tower out of the jenga blocks, is the jenga block tower mine to destroy? Making the argument you're making is like someone coming in and saying \"no, God made the soul of that Jenga block tower, therefore it is not yours to destroy\". Come on Archie, its basic science. Man makes sperm. Woman makes egg. They have some fun and the sperm and egg meet. Then they start growing until they are eventually born, which is the beginning of a human being. If you want to inject religious \"soul\" #### into that, then fine. Do it inside the walls of your own house.\n \n \n \nThe concept of how special and precious each new life is, is evidently beyond you to grasp.\n\n \n It may be precious to you, and that's your choice. However, you, a man, have no business forcing a woman to carry to term her unwanted baby.\n \n \nI really feel for the simplicity of your understanding of this issue of life and death regarding the most innocent members of our society, they being the voiceless unborn. You speak of social humiliation in a day and age when 17 14-17 year old girls in Gloucester Mass are purported to have gotten pregnant on purpose.\n\n \n So, every woman in the world is a slut who gets pregnant on purpose? In case you didn't know, Archie, those 17 women don't represent all women.\n \n \n \nSo explain the humiliation to me shooter. The problem today is that there is no shame for any sins that used to exist.\n\n \n You, being a man, have no idea. Neither do I. We have never been pregnant, and don't know what it feels like. We men have nothing to lose from voting against abortion, because we are not the ones who have to suffer pregnancy.\n \n \n \n \nAnd you speak of vomiting, morning sickness and not being able to drink as if it compares with DIEING a brutal death which every baby that's aborted must suffer.\n\n \n In order to suffer, you must be able to feel pain. In order to suffer, you must be able to think, and to be self aware. More deceiving wording from the anti-choice side.\n \n \n \n \nIt just shows that you have no actual understanding or comprehension of the high price these innocent children pay for the selfish and irresponsible decisions of their so called parents. You really need to get your priorities in order and stop being a follower regarding what you accept as right and moral in life.\n\n \n Priorities eh? Lemme think: Human being, piece of flesh. Human being, piece of flesh. Hmmm... I think I may have to go with the human being.\n \n \n \nDon't you understand that approximately 1.4 million babies are aborted in the USA each year?\n\n \n Good. Less people to destroy the already degrading environment. Of course, I really do with some of these people had the sense to use a condom, but I don't want these people in my country. Its funny how you'll let illegal immigrants die of starvation in their own country by not letting them in ours, but you're all for an extra 1.4 million people here unwanted by even their parents.\n \n \n \n \nThat is around 4000 completely innocent souls a day that will never see life.\n\n \n Yes, there are many more poor souls that will never see life inside of my and every other man's testicles.\n \n \n \nAnd the same people who will scream for the right to kill these innocent children\n\n \n Why do you claim that we scream when pro-life terrorists are out their, shouting, harassing, and bombing women who choose to have an abortion?\n \n \n \n \nwill fight just as fervently to prevent murderers, rapist and convicted gang bangers from being executed.\n\n \n Being an actual human being helps a lot when considering this.\n \n \n \nDoes this sound like justice to you shooter? Does it sound like a rational thought process? Look at the handy work of the abortion industry and tell me this is an industry that is based on compassion and protecting the rights of the innocent.\n\n \n More deception from the anti-choice side. \"Abortion Industry\"? What, is there a company called \"Abortion Inc.\"? All you have shown me with your previous posts is that you are so desperate that you will spread lies through using incorrect language.\n \n \n \n \nBecause they sure aren't protecting the rights of the children they kill for money.\n\n \n More deception. This is why I do not respect the integrity of the Anti-Choice folk. They will do anything to get their point across, including the use of firebombs. Its because of corrupt Republican politicians that these pro-life terrorists aren't at guantanamo where they belong.\n \n \n \n \nhttp://www.mttu.com/abort-pics/index.html And here's a link that talks about the psychological after effects on the mother who goes through this procedure that takes the life of her own offspring. http://www.cirtl.org/syndrome.htm It's called post abortion syndrome.\n\n \n emoticon_wow \n \n Abortion pics?
