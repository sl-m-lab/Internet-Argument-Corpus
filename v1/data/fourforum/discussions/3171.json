   "You may have heard that he has a new book out. \n Here is yet another conservative speaking out against current policies.\n \n http://www.theamericancause.org/\n \n http://www.amconmag.com/2004_09_13/buchanan.html\n \n As has been written here before, we are not an imperial people. We do not have the will or perseverance for empire. We have no desire to rule other nations. Now the \"white man's burden\" is beginning to weigh on our military and imperil the re-election of a president who, at the instigation of the neocons, has foolishly committed American power and wealth to some enterprise called \"the world democratic revolution.\"\n\n \n \n Not only are we borrowing 6 percent of GDP to finance our trade deficit, we are borrowing another 4 percent to finance a budget deficit estimated at $440 billion. You cannot run an empire on borrowed money. Just ask the cousins who bankrupted themselves fighting world wars and maintaining the world's largest empire until it came crashing down after 1945. We, their creditors, inherited the estate.\n\n \n I mean, if this guy realizes that our foreign policy has been run by imperialistic lunatics with no regard for the well-being of the country, we may not be in such dire straights as I had thought. Unless we get 4 more years.",

   "The magazine The American Conservative just does not like Bush. They tend to say that he is not a conservative. Here are some more nice articles by REAL conservatives that don't appreciate the Bush administration.\n \n http://www.amconmag.com/2004_09_13/review.html\n \n Now, if that same person were to ask you which recent president's term in office was characterized by support for the so-called assault weapon ban, a huge increase in deficit spending, bigger budgets for virtually every domestic program-including Americorps and the National Endowment for the Arts-and signing into law a massive increase in federal government regulation of political speech, whose administration would you suspect they were describing? That of Democrat Bill Clinton? Nope. They'd be talking about the first term of Republican President George W. Bush.\n ...\n Perhaps the clearest evidence of how detached this administration is from the constitutional underpinnings that used to hold presidents at arm's length from near-absolute power is a quote unearthed by Bovard and included in the closing chapter of The Bush Betrayal. In April of this year, at a news conference, Bush described himself as \"the ultimate decision-maker for this country.\" As Bovard correctly notes, of course, Bush is at most the decision-maker for the executive branch of the government; the people are the ultimate decision-makers for America. Our Founding Fathers knew that. Generations of Americans understood that. Previous presidents recognized that. Sadly, that constitutionally based and historically sound perspective, which is the cornerstone of what America should stand for, appears not to be a component of the current administration's thinking. And that is a betrayal. \n",
