   "Single payer legislation is the most reasonable solution to the health care crisis facing the United States today. Citizens are called to write-in, phone and visit their Senators, urging them to support Senator Bernie Sander's substitution amendment for Medicare for All.\n \n \nTake Action Now on Single Payer in the Senate\n Tuesday, November 24, 2009\n \n This week single payer activists across the country are visiting their senators to urge them to support real health care reform: (1) allowing state&#8217;s to put in place a state-level single payer program; and (2) supporting Sen. Sanders substitution amendment which would put in place a national Medicare for All system. Please take action by sending your senators a letter by clicking here. And, share this information with everyone you know so they can join in this effort.\n \n Also, in preparation for the Mobilization&#8217;s &#8220;Next Steps,&#8221; the International Human Rights Day single payer effort on December 10th, we have been updating the Mobilization for Health Care for All website. In particular, please see:\n \n 1) The guidelines for Thanksgiving/December actions.\n \n 2) The Sit-In Action Guide\n \n More @http://mobilizeforhealthcare.org/2009/11/24/take-action-now-on-single-payer-in-the-senate/\n\n \n Healthcare is a civil and human right in a just and sane democratic society.\n \n YouTube - Peter, Paul & Mary - If I Had A Hammer",

   "More information on Human Rights Day, December 10th.\n \n \nDay of Action at Senators&#8217; Offices: Human Rights Day, Dec 10th\n Thursday, December 3, 2009\n On December 10th, advocates for &#8220;Medicare for All&#8221; are demonstrating for the right to health care as part of the growing national civil disobedience campaign Mobilization for Health Care for All. The campaign has gained notoriety for having organized more than 35 sit-ins across the country in recent weeks, targeting private health insurance companies and exposing their role as the real &#8220;death panels&#8221; that decide who lives and who dies based on ability to pay.\n \n The campaign escalates as anger turns toward politicians: &#8220;Elected officials are the ones with the power to end this abusive, immoral healthcare system we have,&#8221; says Dr. Margaret Flowers, a Maryland pediatrician and a member of Physicians for a National Health Program. &#8220;They have the power to take out the &#8216;middleman&#8217;&#8212;the private insurance industry&#8212;which does not provide health care but merely inflates the cost for everyone. My patients deserve better.&#8221;\n \n For actions happening near you: Please find them here.\n \n To organize an action, contact organize@mobilizeforhealthcare.org.\n \n Together, we can succeed. @http://mobilizeforhealthcare.org/2009/12/03/day-of-action-human-rights-day-dec-10th/\n\n \n \n Last night I had the strangest dream \n I ever dreamed before\n I dreamed the U.S. Congress passed \n Legislation for Healthcare For All\n \n I dreamed I saw a mighty room\n Filled with women and men\n And the papers they were signing said\n No one would be \n Without healthcare again\n \n And when the papers were all signed\n And a million copies made\n They all joined hands and bowed their heads\n And grateful prayers were prayed\n \n And the people in the streets below\n Were dancing round and round\n While policies, bills and premium statements\n Were shredded and thrown through the air\n \n Last night I had the strangest dream \n I ever dreamed before\n I dreamed the U.S. Congress passed\n Legislation for Healthcare for All\n \n While the ill-ridden, under and uninsured sick\n Approached the hospitals at last\n As doctors and nurses and medical assistants\n Said just come on in now \n If you need care\n \n Last night I had the strangest dream \n I ever dreamed before\n I dreamed the U.S. Congress passed \n Legislation for Healthcare for All.\n \n \n YouTube - Arlo Guthrie /Strangest Dream\n \n \n ...",
