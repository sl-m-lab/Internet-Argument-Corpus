   "Heya, guys. I was just wondering whether any of you could help me out here as I don't know as much as most of you about gun control and such. You see, I've recently been assigned to write a research paper on gun control for my 8th grade class and what I need to know are the strongest arguments for both sides of the issue for my 5th and 6th paragraphs. So if you guys have any ideas, please let me know. emoticon_xgood",

   "The biggest argument I am aware of have to do with the meaning of the second amendment. Some people interpet the Second Amendment to refer toa collective right, more or less given to the states, to create a militia and to arm the militia. Other people believe it is an individual right (so each individual has the right to keep and bear arms).\n \n The other big argument of late has been the \"assault weapon\" ban. In 1994 a bill was signed into law liniting the sale of \"assault weapons\", which were weapons that contained certain features such as bayonet lugs, flash supressors, pistol grips, and certain other features.\n \n The anti-gunners argue that assault weapons are dangerous killing machines. The pro gunners argue that the ban is just foolish, as it does nothing to address functional issues of the weapons and bans purely cosmetic features. I would have to go with the pro-gunners on this one. I don't recall ever in my entire life hearing of a crime commited with a bayonet. \n \n There is an argument over wether certain safety measures, such as gun locks should be mandatory. On this one, the anti-gunners claim they will save lives, the pro gunners claim that we have had guns in this country since the very beginning, and requiring trigger locks is a hindeerance to gun owners and an unneccesary expense to gun manufaturers. Pro gunners argue that by teaching people the safe use and storage of firearms they don't need gun locks.\n \n The big problem is that both sides have attracted a \"lunatic finge\". When doing your report, you need to be careful about any statistics you find from either the pro gunners or the anti gunners. Unfortunatly, those on the lunatic fringe prefer to spin numbers, and sometimes outright lie about them than to give the public honest, reliable information. \n \n You might check out the National Rifle Association webpage and the Handgun Control, inc webpage to get the views of the two different groups.\n \n My personal view is kind of a combination of the two. I believe that guns don't kill people, people kill people. I grew up around guns. My grandfather first taught me to shoot when I was 8 yrs old. I have never known anybody who accidentaly shot themselves, a member of their family, or another person accidentally. I have known some people who shot pople in self defense. Of course, I live in the country. I think just about everybody I know owns at least one gun for hunting and for defense of their homes (it takes the sheriffs department about 10 minutes to get to your house if you call them with an emergency around here). Kids around here learn from an early age the safe care and handling of firearms. I have a lot of trouble understanding the safety aspect of anti-gunners argument, as I can not even imagine a household where there are unsecured weapons and toddlers or other children who haven't been instructed in gun safety. \n \n As far as the constitutional debate, I believe that the second amendment provides an individual right. Of the founding fathers (the guys who wrote the constitution), over half of them owned massive personal arsenals, including cannons, which were the biggest weapons available at the time. I have trouble believing that these guys, who had just overthrown a tyranical government and who ALL owned military rifles were drafting an amendment to the constitution that would prohibit future generations of Americans from having the same individual rights.\n \n I do firmly support background checks for gun buys, though. I do not think that convicted felons should be able to purchase guns. Convicted felons have lost their right to vote, and their right to hold public office, so loosing their right to bear arms is a logical step.\n \n Good luck on your report!",

   "Thats easy...\n \n \"A well-regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State,\n the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.\" \n \n \n - Second Amendment\n to the U.S. Constitution \n \n \n \n But if ya want more butta then:\n \n \n 1. Banning guns works, which is why New York, DC, & Chicago cops need guns.\n \n 2. Washington DC's low murder rate of 69 per 100,000 is due to strict gun control, and Indianapolis' high murder rate of 9 per 100,000 is due to the lack of gun control.\n \n 3. Statistics showing high murder rates justify gun control but statistics showing increasing murder rates after gun control are \"just statistics.\"\n \n 4. The Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban, both of which went into effect in 1994 are responsible for the decrease in violent crime rates, which have been declining since 1991.\n \n 5. We must get rid of guns because a deranged lunatic may go on a shooting spree at any time and anyone who would own a gun out of fear of such a lunatic is paranoid.\n \n 6. The more helpless you are the safer you are from criminals.\n \n 7. An intruder will be incapacitated by tear gas or oven spray, but if shot with a .357 Magnum will get angry and kill you.\n \n 8. A woman raped and strangled is morally superior to a woman with a smoking gun and a dead rapist at her feet.\n \n 9. When confronted by violent criminals, you should \"put up no defense -- give them what they want, or run\" (Handgun Control Inc. Chairman Pete Shields, Guns Don't Die - People Do, 1981, p.125).\n \n 10. The New England Journal of Medicine is filled with expert advice about guns; just like Guns & Ammo has some excellent treatises on heart surgery.\n \n 11. One should consult an automotive engineer for safer seatbelts, a civil engineer for a better bridge, a surgeon for internal medicine, a computer programmer for hard drive problems, and Sarah Brady for firearms expertise.\n \n 12. The 2nd Amendment, ratified in 1787, refers to the National Guard, which was created 130 years later, in 1917.\n \n 13. The National Guard, federally funded, with bases on federal land, using federally-owned weapons, vehicles, buildings and uniforms, punishing trespassers under federal law, is a \"state\" militia.\n \n 14. These phrases: \"right of the people peaceably to assemble,\" \"right of the people to be secure in their homes,\" \"enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people,\" and \"The powers not delegated herein are reserved to the states respectively, and to the people\" all refer to individuals, but \"the right of the people to keep and bear arm\" refers to the state.\n \n 15. \"The Constitution is strong and will never change.\" But we should ban and seize all guns thereby violating the 2nd, 4th, and 5th Amendments to that Constitution.\n \n 16. Rifles and handguns aren't necessary to national defense! Of course, the army has hundreds of thousands of them.\n \n 17. Private citizens shouldn't have handguns, because they aren't \"military weapons\", but private citizens shouldn't have \"assault rifles\", because they are military weapons.\n \n 18. In spite of waiting periods, background checks, finger printing, government forms, etc., guns today are too readily available, which is responsible for recent school shootings. In the 1940's, 1950's and1960's, anyone could buy guns at hardware stores, army surplus stores, gas stations, variety stores, Sears mail order, no waiting, no background check, no fingerprints, no government forms and there were no school shootings.\n \n 19. The NRA's attempt to run a \"don't touch\" campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda, but the anti-gun lobby's attempt to run a \"don't touch\" campaign is responsible social activity.\n \n 20. Guns are so complex that special training is necessary to use them properly, and so simple to use that they make murder easy.\n \n 21. A handgun, with up to 4 controls, is far too complex for the typical adult to learn to use, as opposed to an automobile that only has 20.\n \n 22. Women are just as intelligent and capable as men but a woman with a gun is \"an accident waiting to happen\" and gun makers' advertisements aimed at women are \"preying on their fears.\"\n \n 23. Ordinary people in the presence of guns turn into slaughtering butchers but revert to normal when the weapon is removed.\n \n 24. Guns cause violence, which is why there are so many mass killings at gun shows.\n \n 25. A majority of the population supports gun control, just like a majority of the population supported owning slaves.\n \n 26. Any self-loading small arm can legitimately be considered to be a \"weapon of mass destruction\" or an \"assault weapon.\"\n \n 27. Most people can't be trusted, so we should have laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.\n \n 28. The right of Internet pornographers to exist cannot be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights, but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights.\n \n 29. Free speech entitles one to own newspapers, transmitters, computers, and typewriters, but self-defense only justifies bare hands.\n \n 30. The ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly defends certain parts of the Constitution, and the NRA is bad, because it defends other parts of the Constitution.\n \n 31. Charlton Heston, a movie actor as president of the NRA is a cheap lunatic who should be ignored, but Michael Douglas, a movie actor as a representative of Handgun Control, Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience at the UN arms control summit.\n \n 32. Police operate with backup within groups, which is why they need larger capacity pistol magazines than do \"civilians\" who must face criminals alone and therefore need less ammunition.\n \n 33. We should ban \"Saturday Night Specials\" and other inexpensive guns because it's not fair that poor people have access to guns too.\n \n 34. Police officers have some special Jedi-like mastery over hand guns that private citizens can never hope to obtain.\n \n 35. Private citizens don't need a gun for self-protection because the police are there to protect them even though the Supreme Court says the police are not responsible for their protection.\n \n 36. Citizens don't need to carry a gun for personal protection but police chiefs, who are desk-bound administrators who work in a building filled with cops, need a gun.\n \n 37. \"Assault weapons\" have no purpose other than to kill large numbers of people. The police need assault weapons. You do not.\n \n 38. When Microsoft pressures its distributors to give Microsoft preferential promotion, that's bad; but when the Federal government pressures cities to buy guns only from Smith & Wesson, that's good.\n \n 39. Trigger locks do not interfere with the ability to use a gun for defensive purposes, which is why you see police officers with one on their duty weapon.\n \n 40. Handgun Control, Inc. says they want to \"keep guns out of the wrong hands.\" Guess what? You have the wrong hands",

   "I have alwayl iked those. I call them the \"stupidity list\".\n \n I have a friend who is a liberal democrat. We have debated different issues for years. He summed up the difference between liberals and conservatives pretty well. He said \"The difference between you and me is that I think somebody in the governmet should take care of me. I think they should protect my family and provide my medical care. That is what we pay taxes for. You just want to be left alone to take care of yourself.\"\n \n I thought that summed it up pretty well. I don't want, or feel I need, a babysitter. I am a grown up. I moved out of my parents house a long time ago, I don't need the government to be surrogate parents.\n \n Interestingly enough, my buddies house was broken into one night while he and his wife slept. They were unharmed, but it scared the hell out of both of them. Before the police arrived, the thieves managed to get the TV set, stereo, and a bunch of other valuables and get out of the house. When they heard sirens they fled.\n \n He is now the proud owner of a 1911A1, a mossburg shotgun, and a 9mm Uzi. He figured that it took the police 8 minutes to show up, but it would have taken his thieves about 30 seconds to get upstairs and into the bedroom, had they been so inclined.\n \n It was definatly a surprise when he called at 2:00 in the morning and wanted to know if he could come over and borrow a \"really big gun that holds a lot of bullets.\"\n \n \n Conservative=Liberal who has been mugged\n \n He didn't like the way the math ended up on that one.",

No such decline was observed for homicides or suicides in which guns were not used, and no decline was seen in adjacent metropolitan areas where restrictive licensing did not apply. Our data suggest that restrictions on access to guns in the District of Columbia prevented an average of 47 deaths each year after the law was implemented.\"\n http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/325/23/1615\n \n Would you rather have more or less gun deaths?

   "Rev Hellhound, what you fail to consider in your argument in this regard is the evil spirit that is installed into all guns at the factory (they save the really bad ones for scary looking guns). At any point, these evil spirits could decide to take over the body of anybody who is holding the gun, thus rendering them a blood thirstyt killing machine.\n \n Personally, I am a BIG fan of numbers. And I want the REAL numbers, not some dressed up, phoney, doctored to come to the conclusion that you want numbers. My favorite example of this is some of the CDC reports that have been issued. I would urge anybody who is really interested in the topic to get a copy of the RAW data used to compile the report. \n \n Now, I am by no means an expert in such things. I took statistics in college, and didn't particularly care for it. I CAN add, subtract, multiply , and divide (even if there is a remainder or fractional number involved), and I can do these things well enough to see that there was some pretty serious spin doctoring done on the Clinton CDC report that Handgun control, inc. likes to cite.\n \n I did notice a startling trend when looking at the raw data. Did you know that more children under 5 ar killed by coffee tables than by guns? Even if you just figure kids under five who live in homes where guns are kept, coffee tables are a bigger killer.\n \n I'm not even kidding. Those coffee tables are killing machines, and they \"target\" toddlers. I was unable to find even a single incident of somebody over 5 being killed by a coffee table, but those toddlers, they fall and hit their heads on the sharp corners, or they hit their neck on the edge and break it. The implication is clear.\n \n If you have a toddler and a coffee table, I would really recommend keeping one of them in a closet until the toddler is old enough to not fall and be injured or killed. If you choose to keep the toddler in the closet, PLEASE be sure to cut some air holes.\n \n After reviewing the numbers, I think I do have an explanation for this phenomenon. People are setting their guns on the coffee table, and the evil spirit is escaping the gun and entering the coffee table. I have not yet worked out how evil gun spirits are getting into coffee tables in homes where they have no guns, since to my knowledge evil gun spirits have never been scientifically proven to be able to travel any real distance on thier own.\n \n \n Personally, I think that the \"evil spirit\" tact is the one for the anti-gunners to take. They would be able to make up all the numbers they want (since ther is no way to measure an evil spirit) and not have to worry about the pro-gunners shooting their argument full of holes, so to speak.\n \n Of coure, the WORST kind of pro-gunner is the one who makes up their own numbers in order to refute the anti-gunners numbers. This is usually not really needed. Knowledge has forever been the answer to ignorance and lies.",

I am protected to bear arms as a militia member. \n \n Please read the text of the 2nd Amendment and the legal definition of a militia. Here they are:\n http://www-cgsc.army.mil/dsa/iosd/ip/pubs/Constitution/amendments.asp\n http://www.constitution.org/mil/mil_act_1792.htm\n \n Please read article I carefully. It details that every man above age 17 is in the miltia. You do not have a choice and that each man provides his own firearm. This is expaneded to included every legal CITIZEN.\n \n 3) There is no proof that gun control in the USA works. Please see report by CBS and Center for Disease Control:\n \n http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/10/03/national/main576422.shtml\n \n 4) The flash supressor ban is a joke? Can anyone explain to me how a flash supressor ban has saved lives? or makes the streets safer? No one can.\n \n 5) The 10 round magazine is meaningless. The average gun attack uses less than 4 bullets. The 10 round magazine ban accomplishes NOTHING. With 10 bullets a semi-auto or 6 bullets in a revolver, there is ammo left over in an average criminal attack.\n \n http://ip.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/2/151\n \n 6) There is no proof assault rifle ban saves lives. There is some evidence that police officers in uniform are safer, but NO ONE else is. Please ask my fried VOR for that source. I can not remember the Department of Justice link to the study right now.\n \n 7) More than half of gun deaths are by white men who commit sucide. All other groups who die by guns by sucide or crime do not even equal white men who commit sucide.\n http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/10/03/national/main576422.shtml\n \n Please click on Guns in America interactive. The click on Who is at Risk? So then when the anti-gunners are saying we must save the children? I agree. But how about the white men? Why are they so focused on everyone else? They can do so much more to save lives by concentrating on the depressed white men. What a scam. Yes it is a tragedy that children are dying from gun violence. Why is everyone so scared? and not scared enough about depressed white men?",

That's right. Despite what media coverage might seem to indicate, there are more deaths related to high school football than guns.

So the gun issue is really a non issue. Most homicides in the US are criminal on criminal where in the UK a lot derive from home invasions on unarmed homeowners. Also regarding your statistics:\n \n 3. British citizens are now more likely to become a victim of crime than are people in the United States: \n * In 1998, a study conducted jointly by statisticians from the U.S. Department of Justice and the University of Cambridge in England found that most crime is now worse in England than in the United States. \n * \"You are more likely to be mugged in England than in the United States,\" stated the Reuters news agency in summarizing the study. \"The rate of robbery is now 1.4 times higher in England and Wales than in the United States, and the British burglary rate is nearly double America's.\"158 The murder rate in the United States is reportedly higher than in England, but according to the DOJ study, \"the difference between the [murder rates in the] two countries has narrowed over the past 16 years.\"159 \n * The United Nations confirmed these results in 2000 when it reported that the crime rate in England is higher than the crime rates of 16 other industrialized nations, including the United States.160 \n 4. British authorities routinely underreport murder statistics. Comparing statistics between different nations can be quite difficult since foreign officials frequently use different standards in compiling crime statistics. \n * The British media has remained quite critical of authorities there for \"fiddling\" with crime data. Consider some of the headlines in their papers: \"Crime figures a sham, say police,\"161 \"Police are accused of fiddling crime data,\"162 and \"Police figures under-record offences by 20 percent.\"163 \n * British police have also criticized the system because of the \"widespread manipulation\" of crime data: \n a. \"Officers said that pressure to convince the public that police were winning the fight against crime had resulted in a long list of ruses to 'massage' statistics.\"164 \n b. Sgt. Mike Bennett says officers have become increasingly frustrated with the practice of manipulating statistics. \"The crime figures are meaningless,\" he said. \"Police everywhere know exactly what is going on.\"165 \n c. According to The Electronic Telegraph, \"Officers said the recorded level of crime bore no resemblance to the actual amount of crime being committed.\"166 \n * Underreporting crime data: \"One former Scotland Yard officer told The Telegraph of a series of tricks that rendered crime figures 'a complete sham.' A classic example, he said, was where a series of homes in a block of flats were burgled and were regularly recorded as one crime. Another involved pickpocketing, which was not recorded as a crime unless the victim had actually seen the item being stolen.\"167 \n * Underreporting murder data: British crime reporting tactics keep murder rates artificially low. \"Suppose that three men kill a woman during an argument outside a bar. They are arrested for murder, but because of problems with identification (the main witness is dead), charges are eventually dropped. In American crime statistics, the event counts as a three-person homicide, but in British statistics it counts as nothing at all. 'With such differences in reporting criteria, comparisons of U.S. homicide rates with British homicide rates is a sham,' [a 2000 report from the Inspectorate of Constabulary] concludes.\"168 \n \n Look back over my old posts as I am not doing it again. Your link seemed a litte ambigous and slanted towards UK politics. Was this nation wide or a sampling of certain cities. My results from Scotland yards \"raw\" data were far different.

You see, I've recently been assigned to write a research paper on gun control for my 8th grade class and what I need to know are the strongest arguments for both sides of the issue for my 5th and 6th paragraphs. So if you guys have any ideas, please let me know. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n \n Also, if your paper is not done, I think if looking at it from a legal perspective, I think that it is important to look at least at US v.
