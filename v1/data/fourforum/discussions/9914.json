   "Glossolalia?\n\n \n \n Well, unfrortunatly since Jckker didn't respond I decided to look it up.\n \n Turns out it's Enya lyrics...\n \n ...and I'm 100% correct.\n It's made up ####, known as Glossolalia. aka 'speaking in tongues' for those in the Chrisitan charismatic community.\n \n In past research on 'tongues' over the past few years I came across the fact that some pagan types do it also as well as insane people. Some people (Enya and Dead Can Dance IIRC) even use it in music.\n Last year, a research group did brain scans on tongues speakers and found that the parts of the brain associated with speach were little effected but the parts associated with emotion received more blood flow.\n It has more in common with meditation and chanting than with actually speaking a language.\n \n For this particular song, it was used in the movie Gladiator starring Russell Crowe I found out.\n Phoenetically, some of the words sould latinish. And the only word present that is really a word is Shalom, Hebrew IIRC.\n This type of phenomina gives people the impression that it's a real language when it's nothing but gibberish.\n Mush like when tongues speakers in Chruch toss in 'Jesus' or someother Christo-babble word.\n \n And, while this isn't a religious thread, initially, those who started the recent phenomina of Glossolalia, Pentacostalism in the early 1900's really thought they were speaking a foreign language and not gibberish. Some even going so far in this belief as to travel to other countries...and speak in tongues at people there thinking they were spreading the word of God.\n Over the past decades, the Pentecostals have changed their beliefs on what Glossolalia was for them. Inventing the concept that there are 3 different types of gifts of tongues, one being Glossolalia that's gibberish (for praying to God) and another XenoGlossia, for speaking a new language they never knew before like Germans speaking English or Mandarin to spread the word.\n They really play loose with interpriting their bible.\n \n This brought to you by Zardoz.\n As I tell my wife, \"I know everything about everything\" (while an over exageration, I do play a mean game of trivial pursuit and know a decent amount on linguistics).\n \n \n Personally, I was hoping these lyrics would have been an actual language, like Deep Forest's 'Lulliby'.\n Something with actual meaning that would make me cry over it's message...rather than cry over there realisation that there really is no message. Unless you make one up.",

More so considering the context it's presented in.\n Also, the artist may actually think of the correct spelling as 'Gnoiu'. With silent G and N. Which, isn't a word.\n \n [preacher mode]\n \n Now, get ready.\n Get ready.\n A miracle is going to happen now.\n \n When dealing with music, the syllables of a word are often stetched out. This is proven the case when you actually listen to the song.\n \n Thusly, sayeth Zardoz, We de ze zu bu\n Could actually be more like Wedezezubu.\n See what I'm sayin'?\n \n Okay, now turn to your neighbor and slap em. \n Are you ready for your supernatural break through yet?\n \n 'Course ya are.\n \n Now, when we look up Wedezezubu an the special golden tablets I've been given, we find that it's Cherubic for Chicken ####er. \n Are you with me? Course you are.\n \n Now, when we look up Wedesoooaru which is actually Wede Soaru, we find that in Cherubic it's Chicken Plucker.\n \n Now, to answer your heart's question, 'Shaley koot-tum' is actually Shallhey Kootum which actually isn't Cherubic but a sub dialect of Seraphi for Goat Sodomy. It hasn't been used since the great heavenly conflict known as the War of Northern Angelic Agression. It was a dialect most used by the Southern Angelic Hosts and the current dialect is known as Gweeni Stefani and has been in use by the Gweeni hosts who were exiled to Lake Holtzell about 27,000 years ago.\n \n Now, you're empowered for your harvest of spiritual blessings.\n \n Turn to your neighbor and say 'I'm empowered to harvest my spiritual blessings!'\n \n Praise tha Lawrd!\n \n [/end preacher mode]\n \n \n See, one of the problems with Glossalalia is that most practioners use sounds that, while actually familiar, sound alienish to them. \n Isn't it odd that ALL of Enya's music...sounds the same? Even the songs with real words sound similar to this made up stuff...because people use what's familiar.\n You'll find many still rolling their R's and using familiar cadences and tonal inflictions. But, ignoring any linguistic structuring as they go along. \n Linguistics experts state that it's most closely related to the babbling an infant does. Mimmicking certain sounds with no real meaning or understanding.\n In a recent 2006 study, the parts of the brains affected by glossia aren't those used for languages but, IIRC, emotions.",

What you are failing to understand is that the writer of the lyrics still wrote their interpretation of a sound the same way that some people who speak the English language write certain words. I can understand if it sounded like \"we\" or \"flesh\" but was written a different way but it is not. W + E = WE okay?\n \n It does not flippin' matter if We de ze zu bu is stretched out to SOUND like wedezebu#### or whatever. I'm talking about the written form. Often times singers will drop entire endings of words or consonants to make it sound better but it doesn't mean that what they're singing isn't a word dingle-brain.\n \n Of course the \"we\" in your song and the \"we\" in my language may not have the same meaning but it is still a word in my book.
