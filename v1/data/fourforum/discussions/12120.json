But no, the legacy of \"kinder...\" and \"gentler\" somehow has co-opted this role of big government accountability avoidance. Not only are there no take-away points from this entitlement oriented action from the Fed, but it truly wars against the most basic and fundamental values that set America apart from any other nation... we have rules here, and the ones we don't cross are the one's where someone else picks up the tab for someone else's debauchery - we don't do that here. This is why republicans lost in November, with lowered expectations... you can't disappoint. So there is nothing to be surprised about when we hear nuttiness from the left, but from within our party allowing policies to go on that are antithetical to our values is intolerable.\n \n \n -That Darn Republican",
