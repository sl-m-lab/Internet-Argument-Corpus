   "Here's some stuff from an article about why PC's are better then MAC's (In quotes):\n \n \"1.Did you know that older Macintosh computers and their OS's, are less compatible\n with newer Macintosh's, than any of the older PC's (like the 8086) are to the newer PC's.\n \n 2.PC's are faster. They have CISC processors. That means they have to give more\n instructions than the Mac...but they still do the job faster. If PC's were\n RISC (Reduced Instruction, like Mac's) that means they would be a lot more\n faster than compared to how much faster they are now.\n \n 3. They are Multi-tasking. Which means they can handle more than one job at a\n time. In other words you can print a document in one program and surf the web in another. Macintosh computers cannot do that. MacOS 10 will be the\n first Macintosh OS to support multi-tasking, but it will not be available\n until 99-2000.\n \n 4.Windows 95 lets you use two mouse buttons. That means less clutter on the\n screen with all these extra buttons, because Windows 95/98 can use\n right-click pull down menus. (Macintosh only has one mouse button).\n \n 5.There is much more software for the PC than the Mac, about 1200% more.\n Software usually comes out for the Mac about 1/2 - 2 years after (if ever!)\n the same software has come out for the PC. Some Macintosh users like to\n argue that they only need two or three programs. If you use only two or\n three programs, how can you say the Mac is better?\n \n 6.Software made for older Macintosh systems is not as compatible with newer\n Macintosh systems. Software from an 8086 computer (one of the first PC's\n made) can be run on a 400 MHZ Pentium 2 just as well, or even better.\n \n 7.The Task Bar is movable on PC's (The Mac Bar cannot be moved at all).\n \n 8.PC's cost less money. (PC's with Windows 95/98 cost generally $800 - $2000. A\n Macintosh with the same features would cost $1500 - $3000. And in this case,\n expensive is not always better.\n \n 9. Macintosh computers crash more than PC's. Admit it Mac users! (Macintosh\n computers Crash about twice as much as Windows computers.)\n \n 10. The Mac OS is more restrictive in what types of programs you open files with.\n For example, you must open a JPEG image with a viewer. You cannot open it\n with Simple Text. Now the Windows 95/98 equivalent to Simple Text is\n Notepad, and yes you can open a JPEG image, or any file you want, with\n Notepad\n \n 11. Faster program switching on PC's than Mac. (On Windows you can switch\n programs in a single click with the Taskbar. With a Macintosh you have to\n hold down the mouse button and then let go on the right programs with\n Finder.\n \n 12. Windows 95 PC\\'s have about 90% of the market. Now try to compare that to the\n 2% that Macintosh owns. That just proves how much better Windows is than\n Macintosh. Hey, even Steve Jobs owns an IBM Think Pad.\n \n 13. Why do other websites and magazines say Macintosh is better:\n Because when the Macintosh first came out, it was considered easier to use than\n DOS based PC\\'s. Another big reason why is because most people in working in\n media jobs e.g. TV, desktop publishing etc. that make that claim have bought\n Macintosh computers when they first came out for the reason above. Also the\n software Macintosh computers use, is not compatible with Windows computers,\n so they don\\'t want to spend a lot of time upgrading their computers. Plus in\n addition to that people in media are so used to using Macintosh that they\n don\\'t want to bother learning another OS.\"",
