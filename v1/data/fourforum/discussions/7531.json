   "Fourteen Defining Characteristics Of Fascism \n \n Dr. Lawrence Britt has examined the fascist regimes of Hitler (Germany), Mussolini (Italy), Franco (Spain), Suharto (Indonesia) and several Latin American regimes.\n \n Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each: \n \n 1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays. \n \n 2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc. \n \n 3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc. \n \n 4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized. \n \n 5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution. \n \n 6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common. \n \n 7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses. \n \n 8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions. \n \n 9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\n \n 10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed. \n \n 11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked. \n \n 12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations. \n \n 13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders. \n \n 14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections. \n \n The above is a summery of the more detailed orignal article \"Fascism Anyone?\" first published in Spring 2003 edition of Free Inquiry http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=library&page=britt_23_2&back=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.secularhumanism.org%2Flib%2Flist.php%3Fpublication%3Dfi%26vol%3D23\n\n \n This came to me via email from Randi Rhodes show. I love Randi, http://www.therandirhodesshow.com/live/ she tells it as it is. I just wish I could get better reception of air america.\n \n The Bush regime fits all Fourteen Defining Characteristics Of Fascism. You could go down the list and each one fits the Bush regime.",

Maybe the same case could be made for a revision of the role of the President of the US ?\n \n Limit his powers to meeting and greeting foreign dignitaries, rubber stamping bills that come through the House and going on foreign visits to promote your Country. The President would not be able to nominate judges, propose legislation and he would not be able to nominate a cabinet.\n This would mean that the power of Congress would have to be increased and the biggest party in Congress(or just the House of Representatives) would form the Government, the leader of party would then appoint his cabinet from elected Representatives(or Senator).",

Instead of reasonable, functional buildings designed and constructed to house humble public servants, public buildings in fascist, or pseudo fascist nations tend to all be monuments to the power of the government. This is somthing that we DEFINATLY see in the US. Wander down to you local federal courthouse and tak a look at it.

It's ironic that the solution some people have for checks on the administration is in fact the concept of an entity with even LESS checks on itself.",

It's been reported as fact that it costs more to keep a prisoner in one of the corporate owned prisons that it costs to send a student to Harvard, on a year for year basis. If you really think about it professors cost more than prison guards, Harvard's facilities cost more to keep up than do prison facilities, food, dormatories, training materials, books, scientific equipment, laboratories, libraries, classrooms etc, etc. on one side. Prison cells and prison food on the other. Yet it costs more to keep a prisoner in a corporate prison for a year than it does to keep a student at harvard for a year. So the difference must be in corporate profits. And who pays the tab?\n We have more people in prisons than any other country on earth, save China.\n \n Respectfully submitted for your consideration.\n \n Skybolt",
