   "It seems that after the collapse of military operation aganst South Ossetia Saakashvili understood that his political career has been ended! Moreover prior to war he had sent his wife and children to Beijing but August 10 they arrived to the Crimea! I think that when Saakashvili understood that Russia supported South Ossetia he started thinking about escape from Georgia. Yuschenko promised him to help to move Saakashvili if needed to USA or Turkey. Especially we knew that both of them have close ties with Washington! But I suspect after his escape state coffins may be found substantially emptied. Right now smth abnormal is going on in Finance sphere when you cant have you money from personal account in Georgia.",

   "NATO and EU are trying to play peacekeeping role in the Caucasus and Georgia. But unlike Russians they seem to have a vague idea of what Caucasus is and what Georgia is! That may result in big misfortunes in the region IMHO.\n Look here guys. I strongly doubt that a western man is well aware of all the challenges in Georgia which in fact a loose unit of quite different nations. \n FYI The so called Georgian nation consists of three main subnations (Svany, Mingrely and Kartvely). The last one has some further subdivisions! The most ancient title nation of Georgia is Svany! Our language differs from modern Georgian just in the way German differs from Spanish. Still this ancient language is taboo in Georgia now. Svany has no chance to be educated in this language or to publish books in it. They are also barred from any participation even in local governance to say nothing of the top power structures in Tbilisi. \n Title nation can't rule on its own lands! All the power here belongs to the Alien (Saakashvili) of some shadow origin. And he is poring flows of blood on our soil and he'll spill more of blood to preserve that invented \"territorial integrity of Georgia\"! Don't delude yourselves! Georgia has been unable to form single united nation throughout thousands of years and continues to stand a fragile structure of different nations speaking different languages. \n Let's make it plain. What you see presently is disintegration of Georgia. And it's useless to stop it. The result is going to be blood, lots of it! Svany are taking to arms again (Saakashvili had disarmed Svans) to live in their own state Svanety which they in fact had in the western part of modern Georgia and in 1840 even choose to enter the Russian Empire.... after the collapse of the Georgia Kingdom. History is just making its another circuit...",
