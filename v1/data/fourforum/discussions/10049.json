   "This man appears to have it right. Let's blame Israel and the United States for everything.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n http://www.torontosun.com/News/Columnists/Coren_Michael/2007/06/23/4283786.html\n \n \n \n 1. Watch the fault line\n By MICHAEL COREN\n They drag families out of homes and force wives and children to watch as the men are murdered. They shoot a rival 40 times in the head until there is only mush and muck left. They bind innocent people hand and foot and throw them from the top of apartment buildings. \n \n Whom to blame? Israel and the U.S.A. of course.\n \n They raid the hospitals, caring nothing if the sick and dying are thrown to the floor and trampled. They always seem to go for the hospitals. In Lebanon militia members dragged wounded men, from the same sub-sect of Islam, from their sickbeds and killed them with knives and blades as they moaned for pity.\n \n Whom to blame? Israel and the U.S.A. of course. \n \n They round up their Palestinian brothers as helpless prisoners and then machine-gun them to death. They drag the body of a commander of another faction through the streets from the back of a car, laughing as they do so. \n They firebomb and shoot bullets into a United Nations' school that is immensely sympathetic to their cause but is, they claim, teaching children Christianity. It is not. They round up enemies they claim to be informers when they are nothing of the kind. They kill them like animals while crowds of onlookers cheer. \n \n Whom to blame? Israel and the U.S.A. \n \n A mother of eight children who is pregnant with her ninth plans to be a suicide bomber and kill innocent Israelis -- Muslims and Christians as well as Jews. She is allowed to enter the country because Israel makes exceptions to its closed border on compassionate grounds and gives first class medical treatment to people sworn to destroy it. She is captured, but is unrepentant, as apparently indifferent to the fate of Israeli children as she is to her unborn baby.\n \n Whom to blame? Israel and the U.S.A. of course. \n \n When Israel leaves Gaza, the Palestinians are left businesses and industries. They immediately destroy them. Within days they have assembled mobile rocket launchers and are shelling Israeli border towns. They do this every day until Israel responds. \n \n The rockets and launchers require time and money, both of which could be used to build houses and hospitals and schools. But no. They complain that western countries have cut off aid after they elected a government dedicated to murdering Jews and exterminating a member of the UN. \n But when North America and Europe was giving billions of dollars, they still launched rockets and failed to use the money properly. And what of the billion dollars recently given by Iran, or the countless amounts of cash possessed by Saudi Arabia and the Arab world?\n \n They refuse to deal with this because, yes, it is far easier to blame Israel and the U.S.A. \n \n The world says so little. So few words compared to what was said when Israel defended itself against holy fascist murder gangs in Lebanon or Fatah child-killers in the West Bank. The world lied about the numbers or blindly accepted everything the notoriously dishonest Palestinian spokespeople had to say. The world called for boycotts and motions and condemnation.\n \n Because it's so easy to blame Israel and the U.S.A.\n \n But finally good and fair people are turning. Enough of your lies, enough of your animalistic behaviour, enough of your cause. You, they are saying, and only you are to blame.",
