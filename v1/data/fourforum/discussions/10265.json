Something stiffer than maximum would likely draw an appeal though.\n \n If Virginia convicts him (they have yet to indict) for what he has aledgedly done, he could get 40 years.\n \n \n What has amazed me in following this story (you can't help but do so in Atlanta) is the number of ignorant people who want to let him off just because we need a good quarterback and \"it was only a dog fight\". They haven't bothered to read the indictment and they have no idea how easy it is to get another quarterback. Just like for American Idol...there are thousands of contestants.",

   "Who cares about the prison term, IMHO, it's irrelevent.\n \n Vick is going from the top of the world, the 130 million dollar man plus endorsements, to a man that will be looked down upon by society for the rest of his life. On top of that, he'll likely never play the game he loves again.\n \n If you put it in those terms, he's paying a far heftier price than the law can ever enact, especially compared to anyone else charged with animal cruelty or dog fighting in the history of the world.\n \n Vick will pay for his actions, and pay dearly.\n \n Waxy\n \n P.S. Unfortunately, so will the Falcons and the NFL pay dearly for his actions. He destroyed my fantasy football team, so I too will pay dearly for his actions.",

   "What boggles my mind the most in all of this is that the sportscasters I hear talk about this and Michael Vick himself seem more concerned with the fact that gambling was involved than anything else. Really? Are your priorities that screwed up? Well, I guess that's professional sports for ya. It's the same reason baseball adores Barry Bonds and crucified Pete Rose.\n \n Don't get me wrong, I think Vick is a scumbag who deserves whatever he gets, but I'd just like to point out that when an NFL player beats his wife or girlfriend (or even kills somebody) he is defended by all but the pope. But of course, women are worth much less than dogs.",
