I find myself in agreement with some members fairly consistently, they are still not on my \"team\". Some, Like Jims Trucking, I agree with roughly half the time, and disagree with roughly half the time. Duo Maxwell is the same. The only person here I find myself consistently agreeing with is Georged. I still don't think of him as some kind of twisted team mate or butt buddy or whatever. He is, like me, an extremely rational person who puts their persoanl feelings and emotional bagage on the shelf when making logical assesments. \n \n \n \nI don't mind, as I'm sure VOR doesn't, being referred to as \"pro-Bush\".

Most of his poicies are idiotic. Some are good. I jusgde the policies and the actions. Those who agree with me? since I very rarely comment unless I know what I am talking abotu and have already done the research ahead of time, call them \"right\" or \"correct\"",
