   "So many people have different views on what a Palestinian state should be in the Middle East. Could people please say what they think a Palestinian state should look like when and if it is created in the Middle East. The Palestinian problem is at the heart of most of the violent problems in the Middle East and so the clear picture of what a Palestinian state will look like is very important. No politicians seem to give real and comprenhensive details on what it will look like - just brief details that there should be one in the future.\n \n Some information to help you with your answer:\n \n There are aprox 4,000,000 Palestinian refugees residing in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.\n \n The other main concentration of Palestinian refugees are located in Lebanon - I not sure of the exact number. Others are disapated around the rest of the world.\n \n The Gaza Strip and West bank were formed in the 1967 by the UN as a temporary measure to house the Palestinian refugees located there.\n \n The West bank and Gaza Strip are seperated by land. The West Bank is land locked with no coast line and aprox 5,860 sq km. The Gaza Strip has a aprox 40km of coast line and is 360 sq km.\n \n Infra structure in both sections are very poorly established.\n \n There are probably more details, but this is all I can think at present. Please could you give specifics on size, location, right of return of refugees out side of GS and WB, etc,, in other words give as much detail as you can.\n \n Merlin",
