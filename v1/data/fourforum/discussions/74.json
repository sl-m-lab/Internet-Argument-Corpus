   "And Ben Franklin said:\n \n \"I have lived, Sir, a long time and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth -- that God governs the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire cannot rise without His aid? We have been assured in the sacred writings that, 'except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it.'\"\n \n (Obviously Franklin was not a Diest as many try to label him) Then just two months before he died he also wrote:\n \n \"As to Jesus of Nazareth...it is a question I do not dogmatize upon, having never studied it, and think it needless to busy myself with it now, when I expect soon an opportunity of knowing the Truth with less trouble.\"\n \n Certainly many of the Founding Fathers had a Christian mindset, but the question is \"Were the Founding Fathers Chirstians?\" To prove this one needs a quote in which the speaker gives unquestionable proof that he is trusting in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. Like this quote from Robert E. Lee when he was told that the army chaplains were praying for him daily:\n \n \"I can only say that I am nothing but a poor sinner, trusting in Christ alone for salvation, and need all of the prayers they can offer me.\"",

   "The primary founding fathers of our nation were not Bible-believing Christians; they were deists. Desim was a philosophical belief that was widely accepted by the colonial intelligentsia at the time of the American Revolution. Its major tenets incluced belief in human reason as a reliable means of solving social and political problems and belief in a supreme deity who created the universe to operate solely by natural laws. The supreme God of the Deists removed himself entirely from the universe after creating it. They believed that he assumed no control over it, exerted no influence on natural phenomena, and gave no supernatural revelation to man. A necessary consequence of these beliefs was a rejection of many doctrines central to the Christian religion. Deists did not believe in the virgin birth, divinity, or resurrection of Jesus, the efficacy of prayer, the miracles of the Bible, or even the divine inspiration the the Bible.\n \n Just a few of the founding fathers who were Deists were: George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Ethan Allen, James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, Thomas Paine and many others.",
