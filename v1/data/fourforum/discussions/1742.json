   "By now, most people should realize the war in Iraq was not necessary. The excuse Bush and his regime used to start the war was that we had to disarm Iraq of Weapons of Mass Destruction. The British even said these WMD could be used against us within 45 minutes! As everyone now knows, the WMD did not exist. The excuse for war has been proven to be a fraud.\n \n What made it possible for the Bush regime and the forces for war to bring off their deadly and destructive goal successfully? \n \n An article in The Guardian, Thursday July 17, 2003, sheds some important light on one element that lead to the unnecessary carnage and war that is still going on despite Bush's \"Mission Accomplished\" show. That element is Israel.\n \n Senior Bush regime officials, including defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld, took a bunch of neocons and formed them into a group called Office of Special Plans. The purpose of OSP was to cook the intelligence reports from the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency until it looked the way the forces for war wanted it to look. And the forces for war wanted to paint the false picture of Saddam and Iraq as a threat to the US and the \"free\" world.\n \n The Guardian article reported: \"The OSP was an open and largely unfiltered conduit to the White House not only for the Iraqi opposition. It also forged close ties to a parallel, ad hoc intelligence operation inside Ariel Sharon's office in Israel specifically to bypass Mossad and provide the Bush administration with more alarmist reports on Saddam's Iraq than Mossad was prepared to authorize.\n \n \"'None of the Israelis who came were cleared into the Pentagon through normal channels,' said one source familiar with the visits. Instead, they were waved in on Mr. Feith's authority without having to fill in the usual forms.\n \n \"The exchange of information continued a long-standing relationship Mr. Feith and other Washington neo-conservatives had with Israel's Likud party.\n \n \"In 1996, he and Richard Perle - now an influential Pentagon figure - served as advisers to the then Likud leader, Binyamin Netanyahu. In a policy paper they wrote, entitled A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm, the two advisers said that Saddam would have to be destroyed, and Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Iran would have to be overthrown or destabilized, for Israel to be truly safe.\"\n \n The reason Americans are now dying and being maimed in Iraq is to make sure Israel is \"truly safe.\" The pro-Israel neocons can't come right out and say Americans must die to ensure Israel's safety. Instead they get a greedy, ignorant, egotistical individual like Bush, have one of their own (Paul Wolfowitz) whisper in his ear to destroy Saddam, and the rest is history/current event!\n \n Americans should prepare themselves to sacrifice more for the chosen people! After all, Iraq was just one nation the neocons and the Jews want regime change in. We will have to spend more priceless lives and tens of billions of dollars more in Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Iran!\n \n Already the main stream media is parroting the lie from Israel that perhaps Iraq hid the nonexistent WMD in Syria. The Guardian article reported that intelligence sources said that lie originated in the office of the Israeli prime minister.\n \n When will Americans, especially those in the US armed forces, say enough is enough? After Syria? After Iran? Or, hopefully, NOW!",

   "Let me get this straight, your saying israeli sources persuaded bush and company, to invade iraq.\n \n Ok lets assume your right, why didnt they persuade them to invade iraq, in say 1998. Surely clinton would have gone for it, or would he?\n \n He did bomb them which kept them in line, although i dont think he would have enough political backing for an invasion.\n \n I think, and most people do, that the 9/11, allowed bush to go to war, people became paranoid that it might happen again with worse consequences so he had a good \"excuse\" to go to war, which clinton never had.\n \n However the problem was, there was never any link between him and alquida. So an excuse was needed and evidence of WMDs was overblown to and sold to a nervous and gullible public that saddam was a threat to the world and so he had to go. And so the war took place.\n \n Your connection with israel is a bit dubius, and i wouldnt be suprised if there was a connection, but iraq was invaded in the aftermath of 9/11, if iraq was invaded before 9/11 your claims would be more acceptable.\n \n Oh and broker, can you be specific as to what your saying and to who your refering to.",

   "1. My problem with the average American soldier in Iraq is, that he has been told about how neccessary this war was and how thankful the Iraqis would be after Saddam's fall. Now there are thousands of soldiers, often much too young for such a situation and they see different things: Iraq isn't a friendly county and there are still problems without Saddam. \n British soldiers normally have already served on the Balkan and/or Afghanistan and can rely on their own experiences a bit. They are also handling the cultural differences better. For example, they don't use dogs when searching a house. Why? Because it is an insult for a Muslim to have a dog in his home. A simple thing, that can cause unneccessary trouble when ignored. \n Basra is also not too safe. There a quarters in which even Saddam didn't sent his troops because they are occupied by tribes that make a living with smuggling and drugs. The Brits show their forces, but don't try to interfere too much, because there a structures at work for generations. You can't change such things but Americans are simply trying to do too well in some cases.\n \n ----\n 2. The election got delayed for many times now. Somehow the US administration must have underestimated the situation in Iraq. The only Iraqis with some form of governmental power aren't accepted by the people so this was a bad move too imho.\n The Shiits might have not expressed their goals yet, but they are expected to vote for one of them and through their majority the Sunnits will become the minority in politics. This could really lead to major riots.\n And about the thing with the Mullahs: If they don't copy the Iranian model, they are still one religious group; and the conservatives in Teheran will find ways to get their message to young Iraqis. Or do you also want to forbid them to teach their religion (which they often learned in schools in Iran)?",

They include a man who directed logistics and funding for the September the 11th attacks; the chief of al Qaeda operations in the Persian Gulf, who planned the bombings of our embassies in East Africa and the USS Cole; an al Qaeda operations chief from Southeast Asia; a former director of al Qaeda's training camps in Afghanistan; a key al Qaeda operative in Europe; a major al Qaeda leader in Yemen. All told, more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries. Many others have met a different fate. Let's put it this way -- they are no longer a problem to the United States and our friends and allies. (Applause.) \n \n We are working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks. America and coalition countries have uncovered and stopped terrorist conspiracies targeting the American embassy in Yemen, the American embassy in Singapore, a Saudi military base, ships in the Straits of Hormuz and the Straits the Gibraltar. We've broken al Qaeda cells in Hamburg, Milan, Madrid, London, Paris, as well as, Buffalo, New York. \n \n We have the terrorists on the run. We're keeping them on the run. One by one, the terrorists are learning the meaning of American justice. (Applause.) \n \n As we fight this war, we will remember where it began -- here, in our own country. This government is taking unprecedented measures to protect our people and defend our homeland. We've intensified security at the borders and ports of entry, posted more than 50,000 newly-trained federal screeners in airports, begun inoculating troops and first responders against smallpox, and are deploying the nation's first early warning network of sensors to detect biological attack. And this year, for the first time, we are beginning to field a defense to protect this nation against ballistic missiles. (Applause.) \n \n I thank the Congress for supporting these measures. I ask you tonight to add to our future security with a major research and production effort to guard our people against bioterrorism, called Project Bioshield. The budget I send you will propose almost $6 billion to quickly make available effective vaccines and treatments against agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin, Ebola, and plague. We must assume that our enemies would use these diseases as weapons, and we must act before the dangers are upon us. (Applause.) \n \n Since September the 11th, our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have worked more closely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorists. The FBI is improving its ability to analyze intelligence, and is transforming itself to meet new threats. Tonight, I am instructing the leaders of the FBI, the CIA, the Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense to develop a Terrorist Threat Integration Center, to merge and analyze all threat information in a single location. Our government must have the very best information possible, and we will use it to make sure the right people are in the right places to protect all our citizens. (Applause.) \n \n Our war against terror is a contest of will in which perseverance is power. In the ruins of two towers, at the western wall of the Pentagon, on a field in Pennsylvania, this nation made a pledge, and we renew that pledge tonight: Whatever the duration of this struggle, and whatever the difficulties, we will not permit the triumph of violence in the affairs of men -- free people will set the course of history. (Applause.) \n \n  Today, the gravest danger in the war on terror, the gravest danger facing America and the world, is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. These regimes could use such weapons for blackmail, terror, and mass murder. They could also give or sell those weapons to terrorist allies, who would use them without the least hesitation. \n \n This threat is new; America's duty is familiar. Throughout the 20th century, small groups of men seized control of great nations, built armies and arsenals, and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world. In each case, their ambitions of cruelty and murder had no limit. In each case, the ambitions of Hitlerism, militarism, and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples, by the strength of great alliances, and by the might of the United States of America. (Applause.) \n \n Now, in this century, the ideology of power and domination has appeared again, and seeks to gain the ultimate weapons of terror. Once again, this nation and all our friends are all that stand between a world at peace, and a world of chaos and constant alarm. Once again, we are called to defend the safety of our people, and the hopes of all mankind. And we accept this responsibility. (Applause.) \n \n America is making a broad and determined effort to confront these dangers. We have called on the United Nations to fulfill its charter and stand by its demand that Iraq disarm. We're strongly supporting the International Atomic Energy Agency in its mission to track and control nuclear materials around the world. We're working with other governments to secure nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union, and to strengthen global treaties banning the production and shipment of missile technologies and weapons of mass destruction. \n \n In all these efforts, however, America's purpose is more than to follow a process -- it is to achieve a result: the end of terrible threats to the civilized world. All free nations have a stake in preventing sudden and catastrophic attacks. And we're asking them to join us, and many are doing so. Yet the course of this nation does not depend on the decisions of others. (Applause.) Whatever action is required, whenever action is necessary, I will defend the freedom and security of the American people. (Applause.) \n \n Different threats require different strategies. In Iran, we continue to see a government that represses its people, pursues weapons of mass destruction, and supports terror. We also see Iranian citizens risking intimidation and death as they speak out for liberty and human rights and democracy. Iranians, like all people, have a right to choose their own government and determine their own destiny -- and the United States supports their aspirations to live in freedom. (Applause.) \n \n On the Korean Peninsula, an oppressive regime rules a people living in fear and starvation. Throughout the 1990s, the United States relied on a negotiated framework to keep North Korea from gaining nuclear weapons. We now know that that regime was deceiving the world, and developing those weapons all along. And today the North Korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions. America and the world will not be blackmailed. (Applause.) \n \n America is working with the countries of the region -- South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia -- to find a peaceful solution, and to show the North Korean government that nuclear weapons will bring only isolation, economic stagnation, and continued hardship. (Applause.) The North Korean regime will find respect in the world and revival for its people only when it turns away from its nuclear ambitions. (Applause.) \n \n Our nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean Peninsula and not allow an even greater threat to rise up in Iraq. A brutal dictator, with a history of reckless aggression, with ties to terrorism, with great potential wealth, will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the United States. (Applause.) \n \n  Twelve years ago, Saddam Hussein faced the prospect of being the last casualty in a war he had started and lost. To spare himself, he agreed to disarm of all weapons of mass destruction. For the next 12 years, he systematically violated that agreement. He pursued chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, even while inspectors were in his country. Nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these weapons -- not economic sanctions, not isolation from the civilized world, not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities. \n \n Almost three months ago, the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein his final chance to disarm. He has shown instead utter contempt for the United Nations, and for the opinion of the world. The 108 U.N. inspectors were sent to conduct -- were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hidden materials across a country the size of California. The job of the inspectors is to verify that Iraq's regime is disarming. It is up to Iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weapons, lay those weapons out for the world to see, and destroy them as directed. Nothing like this has happened. \n \n The United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons sufficient to produce over 25,000 liters of anthrax -- enough doses to kill several million people. He hasn't accounted for that material. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed it. \n \n The United Nations concluded that Saddam Hussein had materials sufficient to produce more than 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin -- enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure. He hadn't accounted for that material. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed it. \n \n Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent. In such quantities, these chemical agents could also kill untold thousands. He's not accounted for these materials. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them. \n \n U.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently turned up 16 of them -- despite Iraq's recent declaration denying their existence. Saddam Hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of these prohibited munitions. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed them. \n \n From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs. These are designed to produce germ warfare agents, and can be moved from place to a place to evade inspectors. Saddam Hussein has not disclosed these facilities. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed them. \n \n The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a nuclear weapon and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb. The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production. Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained these activities. He clearly has much to hide. \n \n The dictator of Iraq is not disarming. To the contrary; he is deceiving. From intelligence sources we know, for instance, that thousands of Iraqi security personnel are at work hiding documents and materials from the U.N. inspectors, sanitizing inspection sites and monitoring the inspectors themselves. Iraqi officials accompany the inspectors in order to intimidate witnesses. \n \n Iraq is blocking U-2 surveillance flights requested by the United Nations. Iraqi intelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are supposed to interview. Real scientists have been coached by Iraqi officials on what to say. Intelligence sources indicate that Saddam Hussein has ordered that scientists who cooperate with U.N. inspectors in disarming Iraq will be killed, along with their families. \n \n Year after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous sums, taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction. But why? The only possible explanation, the only possible use he could have for those weapons, is to dominate, intimidate, or attack. \n \n With nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, Saddam Hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle East and create deadly havoc in that region. And this Congress and the America people must recognize another threat. Evidence from intelligence sources, secret communications, and statements by people now in custody reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists, including members of al Qaeda. Secretly, and without fingerprints, he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists, or help them develop their own. \n \n Before September the 11th, many in the world believed that Saddam Hussein could be contained. But chemical agents, lethal viruses and shadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained. Imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons and other plans -- this time armed by Saddam Hussein. It would take one vial, one canister, one crate slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none we have ever known. We will do everything in our power to make sure that that day never comes. (Applause.) \n \n Some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent. Since when have terrorists and tyrants announced their intentions, politely putting us on notice before they strike? If this threat is permitted to fully and suddenly emerge, all actions, all words, and all recriminations would come too late. Trusting in the sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein is not a strategy, and it is not an option. (Applause.) \n \n The dictator who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons has already used them on whole villages -- leaving thousands of his own citizens dead, blind, or disfigured. Iraqi refugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained -- by torturing children while their parents are made to watch. International human rights groups have catalogued other methods used in the torture chambers of Iraq: electric shock, burning with hot irons, dripping acid on the skin, mutilation with electric drills, cutting out tongues, and rape. If this is not evil, then evil has no meaning. (Applause.) \n \n And tonight I have a message for the brave and oppressed people of Iraq: Your enemy is not surrounding your country -- your enemy is ruling your country. (Applause.) And the day he and his regime are removed from power will be the day of your liberation. (Applause.) \n \n The world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm. America will not accept a serious and mounting threat to our country, and our friends and our allies. The United States will ask the U.N. Security Council to convene on February the 5th to consider the facts of Iraq's ongoing defiance of the world. Secretary of State Powell will present information and intelligence about Iraqi's legal -- Iraq's illegal weapons programs, its attempt to hide those weapons from inspectors, and its links to terrorist groups. \n \n We will consult. But let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam Hussein does not fully disarm, for the safety of our people and for the peace of the world, we will lead a coalition to disarm him. (Applause.) \n \n Tonight I have a message for the men and women who will keep the peace, members of the American Armed Forces: Many of you are assembling in or near the Middle East, and some crucial hours may lay ahead. In those hours, the success of our cause will depend on you. Your training has prepared you. Your honor will guide you. You believe in America, and America believes in you. (Applause.) \n \n Sending Americans into battle is the most profound decision a President can make. The technologies of war have changed; the risks and suffering of war have not. For the brave Americans who bear the risk, no victory is free from sorrow. This nation fights reluctantly, because we know the cost and we dread the days of mourning that always come. \n \n We seek peace. We strive for peace. And sometimes peace must be defended. A future lived at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace at all. If war is forced upon us, we will fight in a just cause and by just means -- sparing, in every way we can, the innocent. And if war is forced upon us, we will fight with the full force and might of the United States military -- and we will prevail. (Applause.) \n\n Bush's case for war 2003",

Korea, then . . . . . . . . . .\n\n \n yes. in case you have missed things, i'll provide a quick recapt\n in his 2003 State of the Union , Bush says \n \n Different threats require different strategies. In Iran, we continue to see a government that represses its people, pursues weapons of mass destruction, and supports terror. We also see Iranian citizens risking intimidation and death as they speak out for liberty and human rights and democracy. Iranians, like all people, have a right to choose their own government and determine their own destiny -- and the United States supports their aspirations to live in freedom. (Applause.) \n \n On the Korean Peninsula, an oppressive regime rules a people living in fear and starvation. Throughout the 1990s, the United States relied on a negotiated framework to keep North Korea from gaining nuclear weapons. We now know that that regime was deceiving the world, and developing those weapons all along. And today the North Korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions. America and the world will not be blackmailed. (Applause.) \n \n America is working with the countries of the region -- South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia -- to find a peaceful solution, and to show the North Korean government that nuclear weapons will bring only isolation, economic stagnation, and continued hardship. (Applause.) The North Korean regime will find respect in the world and revival for its people only when it turns away from its nuclear ambitions. (Applause.) \n \n Our nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean Peninsula and not allow an even greater threat to rise up in Iraq. A brutal dictator, with a history of reckless aggression, with ties to terrorism, with great potential wealth, will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the United States. (Applause.) \n\n \n so yes, iran and NK are next to be transformed, though not necessarily by invasion. remember though that gulf war 2 came 12 years after a ceasefire\n \n \nOf course there will always be lots of rants and complaints.\n But my question is still why did the USA have to start their new \"humanity-preserving-role\" with a war and in a region where much more risk is involved than in other countries with similar problems?\n\n \n why iraq and why now?\n well a rhetorical response along my sig would be why not iraq and why not now. but a more comprehensive response.\n \n 1. 911 transformed the way we pursue our foreign policy\n 2. there was an opportunity with iraq because \n 2a. he was a well recognized and documented madman (but this is not unique to the world)\n 2b. because iraq is in the ME where most of terrorism is currently exported from (also not unique to the region)\n 2c. because iraq had agreed to terms of a ceasefire which it then violated for the next 12+ years while sanctions have failed to bring about meaningful policy changes in saddam while hurting the iraqi themselves (unique opportunity)\n \n \n\n '\n It also isn't neccessarily about \"imposing western values on sovereign states\", it would be less (especially in the inhabitants eyes) e.g. if the first American company in Iraq wasn't a BK joint ;) .\n\n this has got to be a joke, right? emoticon_rolleyes\n there were other US companies in iraq before BK\n and the \"imposing western values on sovereign states\" pertained to how these \"sovereign\" states behave politically, not economically.",

   "Are you referring to our embargo?\n\n \n yes\n \n this is always a problem in dealing with a despotic regime that doesn't care about its people. \n especially when there are ways around it via the oil for food program where they consistantly buy less food than the UN recommended and kept the surplus for personal uses. when they also were able to trade millions of oil to international figures to look the other way.\n \n \nThe Cash-for-Saddam Program\n \n By MICHAEL SOUSSAN\n \n The cat is out of the bag. Documents recently discovered by the Coalition Provisional Authority, and corroborated by interviews with former Iraqi officials, confirm that Saddam Hussein extorted cash kickbacks from companies trading with Iraq under the U.N. Oil-for-Food Program. The most damning document is a memo dated Aug. 3, 2000, by Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan (now in U.S. custody) instructing his ministers to tell their suppliers to inflate their prices by the \"biggest percentage possible.\" As a former employee of the program, I cannot say I was surprised by this news. What surprised me was the U.N.'s response to it.\n \n * * *\n \n U.N. officials claim they were unaware of such fraudulent practices by the Iraqi regime until after the Iraq War. They would be better off telling the truth. By winter 2000, serious concerns had been raised about the use of front companies by the regime. We had heard allegations of a 10% kickback scheme, and were exceptionally well positioned to investigate the matter. Why did the U.N. fail to investigate?\n \n U.N. officials claim it was not their responsibility to hold the Iraqi regime accountable. False again. The whole point of putting the U.N. in charge of overseeing Iraq's trade was to ensure that the country's oil revenues were used exclusively to help its ailing population, not to fill Saddam's personal coffers. And according to Security Council resolutions, the U.N. had a legal responsibility to report on any issue affecting the \"adequacy, equitability and effectiveness\" of the Oil-for-Food Program. Saddam's kickbacks affected all three aspects. There were many instances in the time I was there when the U.N. preferred to look the other way rather than address obvious signs of what was going wrong.\n \n Take the medical sector. The regime's decision to use kickback-friendly front companies to purchase drugs meant that hospitals often received medicines that were nearly expired or otherwise damaged from unscrupulous suppliers. Iraqi doctors would complain about the quality of the drug supply to our U.N. observers. Kurdish leaders raised similar concerns directly with high-level U.N. officials. We knew exactly how much the Iraqi government paid for any contract, and we had the authority to inspect each shipment when it crossed into Iraq. We had all the elements necessary to piece together a clear picture of what was going on and alert the Security Council to the fact that Saddam and his cronies were buying poor quality products at inflated prices and cashing in the difference. While the U.N. likes to claim this was the most audited program in its history, I never once read an audit report that raised questions about these practices -- even though they were an open secret to anyone involved in the program.\n \n Some $31 billion worth of humanitarian supplies were delivered to Iraq during the lifespan of the program. If 10% kickbacks were indeed extorted from this trade, that means Saddam cheated his people out of $3 billion. In reality, the profits he reaped from the program may have been much higher. If one adds the kickbacks he received from the sale of underpriced Iraqi crude, the figure might double. The continued building of palaces and other extravagances give some clue to where this money went. What is left of it? Where is it held? These are questions to which Iraqis want answers. And the U.N. has a responsibility to help them by opening the books of the Oil-for-Food Program.\n \n As long as Saddam was in control, it was perhaps inevitable that he would have profited from any attempt to feed his population. But the least the U.N. could have done was denounce his practices. Instead, high-level U.N. officials concentrated their fire on the Security Council. Assistant Secretary General Denis Halliday even accused the Council of overseeing genocide in Iraq. At the time that he made this claim, the Iraqi regime was refusing to purchase as much food and medicine as the U.N. had recommended. One has only to read the flowery letter Kofi Annan sent to Mr. Halliday upon his resignation to understand that our marching orders were confused. Were U.N. employees supposed to oppose Security Council resolutions, lobby for a lifting of sanctions and whitewash the regime? That is what a majority of our Baghdad staff did. No one took action to redress their behavior.\n \n The small minority who sought to hold the regime accountable were overruled, sidelined and sometimes branded spies by our own leadership. Meanwhile, the Saddam regime had infiltrated our mission in Iraq. All of the 4,233 local staff hired by the U.N. were required to report to Iraqi intelligence services. At our Baghdad HQ, U.N. mission leaders saw no problem with assigning Iraqi staff to man our switchboard, fax machines and photocopy room. Our 151 international observers were under siege, spied on by their employees and sometimes threatened by Iraqi officials when they tried to communicate information to New York that was embarrassing to the regime. All of this severely curtailed the U.N.'s ability to do its job.\n \n The U.N. should not have been in the business of covering up for Saddam; and it should not now stonewall efforts to have an independent investigation look into which companies broke the law in their dealings with the regime and who profited from schemes to get around the restrictions set out under Oil-for-Food. If the U.N. fails to become a partner in the investigative process, it may end up as co-defendant in a scandal that has yet to reach its full-blown proportion.\n \n Mr. Soussan is a former program coordinator for the U.N. Oil-for-Food Program.\n\n \n from yesterday's WSJ\n \n i haven't even mentioned the estimates of deaths attributed to the UN sanctions.",

Thank you for posting, it was very good. \n First off, I agree with you that sanctions do not seem to work. (I think that it what you are saying, I apoligize if I misunderstand.) In principle I agree with the idea behind them, but I am not sure that they have ever had the desired effect of causing the regime to suffer or perhaps incite a revolution. Instead, they only cause the people to suffer. - (To throw in a little jab at the Republicans, in what seems to be a pretty apparent effort to court Cuban voters in Florida, Bush (click here for CNN article) said he would veto any legislation that would ease the embargo.

It was for the iraqi people, america invaded iraq for the love of the iraqi people, now lets see who else america loves, chechens, no way, russia can fight back, Zimbabwe, they got a nasty racist dictator, no, no oil, how abou sri lanka, civil war there people killing each other, na, no oil. Need i go on? just ask.\n\n \n why invade a helpless third world country crippled by a decade of sanctions?  \n because they were deemed in violation of the ceasefire and still was developing wmd that could then be used on their neighbors has they had with the kurds and iran. all the world thought iraq was still actively developing wmd, from the UN, france, germany, russia, uk, and the US. if you have evidence that the world knew (note past tense, knew as in before the war started) iraq did not have wmd, i would love to see. if not, as i have already suggested, a whine of \"lies!\"\n besides, as i've already mentioned there were harmful effects on the iraqi because of the UN sanctions\n oil? \n how do you mean by this? did the US do it to gain oil for itself? no. there has been no evidence of this based on previous US opportunity to take over kuwait and control the oil delivery through the straight of hormuz. and since the invasion, there has been no attempt to grab the oil. so if you have evidence to suggest that the war was for oil, i would like to see it. otherwise it is only as i suggested already, a worned out chant without substance.\n iraqi vs chechens vs zimbawe?\n iraq because it is in the middle east. a region devoid of democracy and freedom. a region spawning radical international terrorist like no other. the thought being if a free and secure democratic stronghold in the ME can be established, this would spread and go a long way toward preventing the spread of radical fundamentalism. iraq is a cultural center of the ME with a people who are more capable and yearning for democracy than most in the region.\n iraq also because there was a \"legal\" opportunity to do so. the \"legal\" opportunity comes about from violation of the ceasefire, a ceasefire from a US lead and UN sanctioned war against iraq in 91.\n in short, iraq because of both the need and the opportunity to do so.\n why not chechens?\n because there is no such state as chechnya. because it is legally part of russia. because the chechens have taken up terrorism. it is not because of fear of russia, afterall, the soviet union had already been confronted and defeated. russia is just a shadow of the soviet union.\n why not zimbabwe? because there is not enough resources to do so. because there is no legal opportunity to do so. because Mugabe did not declared himself as a regional threat at least until 5 years ago. we waited 12 years with iraq, we can wait longer with zimbabwe. because property is being taken, not people butchered.\n why not sri lanka? because there is a ceasefire there already brokered by the norwegians in 2001\n \n personally if we have the resources to do so, i would wage a global war against despotism! but resource is limited, thus a priority list has to be formulated. this is reasonable to do what you can when you can, do it in a priority order and do it well enough to win.\n oil can be bought elsewhere. oil can be gotten from alaska which we have not wanted to do. it wasn't anymore about oil in 2003 than it was in 91.\n \n \nWhere shall we start, saddam, he was a very good american friend, even rumsfeld shook hands with him and congratulated him on his stance against fundemantalists in iran, america even helped him, arms, chemical weapons finance, etc... Taliban, helped them fight the soviet invasion of afghanistan, even bin laden, LOL. Milosovic, he was a friend, helped in the peace accord in bosnia, remember deyton. All those eastern european countries that helped the allies, sold out to stalin, there are more. \n\n \n saddam \n i have already acknowledge that he was an ally against the fundamentalism of iran. but note that the term ally as applied to saddam is very loose. iraq had always been first in the soviet sphere of influence. note that they use soviet equipments for instance. when the soviet started crumbling, who step in? the french. look it up. the US interaction with saddam regarding military totalled less than 10% the top three? fraqnce, germany, and russia. look it up. and economically? jordan, france, germany, and russia again! but then he started acting out. the US started distancing themselves when he started using wmd against iran, and later against the kurds. the break come when he invaded kuwait. why was he ever a \"friend\" at all? because initially he wasn't obviously a madman and a threat to the region.\n taliban \n the US never helped the taliban militarily or recognized them diplomatically. look it up. they were but one of many bands fighting against the soviet but their rise did not actually occurred until after the soviet had withrawn. you don't know your history as well as you think (and as evidenced by your germany comment)\n bin laden \n same with saddam. he wasn't seen as a terrorist. he was seen has fighting in afghanistan against the soviet invasion of afghanistan to liberate afghanistan. in the setting of the cold war, why not? did he sprout anti-western rhetorics then? did he ordered planes into buildings then? did he had to go bad? well he did choose to and when he did, we quickly branded him as terrorist and sought to hunt him down even before 911. look it up.\n milosovic\n lol. he wasn't a friend with bosnia at all! bosnia was originally viewed by Clinton as a European problem. afterall, it is in europe. but the european couldn't decide what to do as bosnia was being cleansed, so the UN was brought in. and a swell job they did too defending sebrenica! it wasn't until the europeans had failed and the UN had failed did the US take up the charged by bombing milosovic's home town of belgrade and forced a end to the war in bosnia. so he gave in. he \"help\" in so as much as was forced to stop supporting the bosnian serbs. emoticon_rolleyes\n and when he resumed similar in Kosovo, the US didn't wait so much for the Europeans or the UN this time before they let bombs dropped in serbia and supported the opposition in serbia and the montenegrans. you need to read more before you make silly charges such as this one.\n eastern europe \n did not help the allies against the nazi. they were actually satellite states and allies that provided troops for the nazi. (what history book are you reading?!?)\n \n a substantial of your charges are grossly historically inaccurate.\n the remainder would require someone with preconiscience because when saddam came to power, and bin laden fighting the soviet, no one thought them likely to go mad. this is why i charged you with being an end justifies the means, placing emphasis on outcome after the fact to judge the actions leading to the outcome.\n \n \nWho wants to be friends with america, well everybody of course, lol, even castro, theres a lot of dollars available to any american friendly dictators, would you like me to name them?\n\n \n who wants to be friends with america?\n i've already answered this one\n 1. the japanese wanted to be friends after ww2\n 2. so did the germans\n 3. so do the chinese as they seek greater economic ties to both improve themselves as a power and improve the lot for the chinese\n 4. the vietnamese do, much like the chinese, despite losing a million people in a war barely more than a generation ago with the US\n 5. the eastern europeans do. and no, they don't trade with the US as much as they do with western europe. yet they sided with the US against germany and france in the lead up to the war\n 6. the iraqi do. read what the average iraqi are saying. and no, the majority of iraqi are not placing roadside bombs and blowing up other iraqi. they much rather be friend with the US than the french or the UN\n 7. the irannians want to become friends, there has been numerous accounts since they have resumed pilgrimage to iraq holy sites.\n \n does everyone wants to friends with the US, no. but in addition to the above there are others. thus i charged you with the error of generalizing from a part to the whole.\n \n \n much of what i posted is simple history and media reports\n nothing from any official government pronouncements.\n you charge of propaganda only betrays your own brainwashing by the peacemongers and america-haters, and your own gross ignorance of history.",

   "the policy of the enemy of my enemy is my friend has always been the standard for international diplomacy since inception\n what are your suggestions to handle a pariah government\n isolate them like NK?\n engage them like South Africa during apartheid to affect changes?\n\n I think it would be different than your examples. Egypt relies on US aid. They couldn't restist for years to change. It couldn't be too drastic, but over the years, a lot could have happened. And it would also be quite cheap as no troops would be needed.\n \n \n \ni think you answered your own question\n there is a huge reluctance in diplomacy to give strict dates because it always come accross as an ultimatum.\n\n That's true but why even bother the security council with a resolution when you are already sure about the outcome like the US were?\n Saddam was scared (due to the military threat) and the inspections worked better than before.\n The US did entirely rely on the problem, that a 'material breach' could be nearly anything and that the 'countermeasures' (don't know the exact term right now) could be nearly anything.\n \n \n \n \ninternational diplomacy has always involved both threats and payment. \n\n Agreed.\n \n \n \nwhen the axis thing came out, i was a bit perplexed myself.\n since then i have been surprised how radical the NK government really is as it sells weapon technology and even drugs abroad to perpetuate its cult of personality.\n and the charges against iran being oppressive certainly true, especially invalidating 1/3 of the candidates for recent election. and their nuclear weapon programs much further along than anyone thought.\n\n NK takes its only chance, imo. It can't expect any confessions from the international community. \n After the US showed that they would start a war instead of endless diplomatics (*quote could be used against me* ;) ), NK needed everything that would prevent a war or invasion.\n A few missiles and a handful of nukes is enough in their case to keep others away. \n It is, however, maybe the most difficult problem to solve.\n But military solutions are the least useful imo.\n \n \nregarding the iranians themselves, i am continually surprised at how the younger iranians view the US more and more positive than their elder, and as a whole since the war. many iranians pilgrim have come to iraq and have interacted with american GIs. their response have all been surprisingly positive.\n\n The young Iranians are in a sad position. The vast majority of them would like to live like young people in our countries; go to dances, meet girls and boys, visit a bar or go to cinema. All of these things are restricted or forbidden by the Mullahs. \n They get a very good school education and their universities are good as well. But their degrees are nearly useless because there are no jobs, Economic changes are slowed or stopped by the Mullahs.\n The youths' chance was the election that Chatami won first (90ies). They voted for him because they hoped and believed that he would change things quickly.\n Problem was that the judicative is controlled by the religious elite, same with other gremiums that decide about significant reforms. So he could only change few things and not in a fast way. \n To keep his position at home, he also couldn't give in to many of the Western and ,especially, US demands.\n We made the mistake and judged this as an old behaviour and didn't give enough support. \n At the end, the West saw Chatami as a puppet of the Mullahs, the Mullahs still regarded him as dangerous and the youths thought he failed.\n \n Now, voices get louder to show the West the importance of Iran and the radicals can enforce their will to get the bomb like Pakistan did. \n The young people don't show much interest in politics anymore and so a big chance was gone imo.\n \n \n \n \ni think the government in general is focusing on finding the best solution. since humans are imperfect i don't expect the government to be either.\n there are articles on diplomatic exchanges in the US as well. But they are not usually on the front page. \n \n Agreed.\n \n \n \n \nwho do you hear it from if not the media?\n\n Got me.\n But official speeches include the terms 'war' , 'enemy' , 'modern warfare' and 'military budgets' more often than in recent years. I refer to Bush's speech to the nation and other conferences where international issues were discussed. \n \n \nyes, the fundamentalist will not like it at all when the ME is democratized. But the new way isn't about appeasing the fundamentalists who hate the US (hate is irrational and cannot be addressed by reason), the new way is about making life better for middle easterners and when life is better, radical fundamentalism preaching hate would have a harder time taking root and spreading.\n\n I just think that the fundamentalists will have a harder time to recruit followers on a peaceful street than in bombed-out cities.\n And the time that it takes to get streets out of ruins is time that is ticking for the fundamentalists.",

   "amazing!\n i responded to all of your post and you still don't get it\n let me try again and i'll be straight forward this time since your range of comprehension and debate seem limited.\n\n No you didnt respond to any of my points, you just quoted propoganda sources, you completely ignored the main points and you only responded to them when i stated them more simply for you, and even then you all you have managed to do is repeat yourself, you still havent justified the invasion of iraq.\n \n \nwhy invade a helpless third world country crippled by a decade of sanctions?  \n because they were deemed in violation of the ceasefire and still was developing wmd that could then be used on their neighbors has they had with the kurds and iran.\n\n Exactly, they used them before, long begore gw1, why didnt your moralistic america do anything about saddam then, oh sorry, he was fighting an american enemy and was selling oil very cheaply to america.\n \n \nall the world thought iraq was still actively developing wmd, from the UN, france, germany, russia, uk, and the US. if you have evidence that the world knew (note past tense, knew as in before the war started) iraq did not have wmd, i would love to see. if not, as i have already suggested, a whine of \"lies!\"\n\n germany, russia, france, the U.N, never sanctioned the invasion, those countries along with the U.N inspection team clearly stated that iraq had no wmds, where you read or heard the \"whole world thought\" im not sure, but i suspect from the american government propoganda machine. It was this machine that rolled out a whine of lies, which obviously you fell for.\n \n \noil? \n how do you mean by this? did the US do it to gain oil for itself? no. there has been no evidence of this based on previous US opportunity to take over kuwait and control the oil delivery through the straight of hormuz. and since the invasion, there has been no attempt to grab the oil. so if you have evidence to suggest that the war was for oil, i would like to see it. otherwise it is only as i suggested already, a worned out chant without substance.\n\n Lets see, after U.S troops entered baghdad, during the chaos, when people were looting anything and everything, did the U.S troops help the poor hungry iraqi people, no, they went straight for the oil ministry building, not the hospitals to help, not the government offices, but the oil ministry. Who now has contracts, for the oil, american companies, so who now controls iraqi oil? You dont honestly believe its the iraqis do you, your more niave than i thought.\n \n \niraqi vs chechens vs zimbawe?\n iraq because it is in the middle east. a region devoid of democracy and freedom. a region spawning radical international terrorist like no other. the thought being if a free and secure democratic stronghold in the ME can be established, this would spread and go a long way toward preventing the spread of radical fundamentalism. iraq is a cultural center of the ME with a people who are more capable and yearning for democracy than most in the region.\n\n really, what about saudi arabia, kuwait, qatar, there all stable democratic countries, arent they? who are also very friendly with the U.S, they border iraq, arent they more central, more important? Why havent they been used as an example to secure a free and democratic ME. Arent they the shining example of ME democracy.\n \n \niraq also because there was a \"legal\" opportunity to do so. the \"legal\" opportunity comes about from violation of the ceasefire, a ceasefire from a US lead and UN sanctioned war against iraq in 91.\n in short, iraq because of both the need and the opportunity to do so.\n\n There was no violation of the ceasefire, iraq was complying with U.N resolutions, thats why the U.N security council didnt approve the invasion and thats why no wmds exist. Yes, the need for control of iraqi resources, mainly oil.\n \n \nwhy not chechens?\n because there is no such state as chechnya. because it is legally part of russia. because the chechens have taken up terrorism. it is not because of fear of russia, afterall, the soviet union had already been confronted and defeated. russia is just a shadow of the soviet union.\n\n Huh, have i missed some part of history here, when was the soviet union confronted and defeated, when did this war take place, (dont mention the cold war)they just saw sense and threw out communism, you never defeated them, what is it revisionist history,lol. \n \n \nwhy not zimbabwe? because there is not enough resources to do so. because there is no legal opportunity to do so. because Mugabe did not declared himself as a regional threat at least until 5 years ago. we waited 12 years with iraq, we can wait longer with zimbabwe. because property is being taken, not people butchered.\n\n There was no legal opportunity in iraq either, that didnt stop america, nothing is stopping america here except america, no oil.\n \n \npersonally if we have the resources to do so, i would wage a global war against despotism! but resource is limited, thus a priority list has to be formulated. this is reasonable to do what you can when you can, do it in a priority order and do it well enough to win.\n\n Congratulations, at least your being honest and consistent, im not sure wether that makes you a war monger or not, or even a self serving moralcrat, but that does make sense, the only problem is consistency.\n \n \noil can be bought elsewhere. oil can be gotten from alaska which we have not wanted to do. it wasn't anymore about oil in 2003 than it was in 91.\n\n Yes you can get oil almost anywhere? but at what price, controlling ME oil ensures a steady flow at a price thats suits americas economy, america relies on imported oil, it would up a creek without a paddle if a barrel reached $60. Or didnt you know that.\n \n \nsaddam \n i have already acknowledge that he was an ally against the fundamentalism of iran. but note that the term ally as applied to saddam is very loose. iraq had always been first in the soviet sphere of influence. note that they use soviet equipments for instance. when the soviet started crumbling, who step in? the french. look it up. the US interaction with saddam regarding military totalled less than 10% the top three? fraqnce, germany, and russia. look it up. and economically? jordan, france, germany, and russia again! but then he started acting out. the US started distancing themselves when he started using wmd against iran, and later against the kurds. the break come when he invaded kuwait. why was he ever a \"friend\" at all? because initially he wasn't obviously a madman and a threat to the region.\n\n He bagan by helping the U.S, which america aknowledged and gave him support. both military, wmds and so on, america provided the funds and france and russia the hardware, look it up, you will see america funded the purchase of most of iraqs hardware. When he did his job and weakened iran, he wasnt needed anymore, the american aid stopped and iraq is left bankrupt after fighting the evil american enemy, iran. What does america do, nothing, turned there back on him, he wasnt needed any more. No wonder no middle east country trusts the U.S.\n \n \ntaliban \n the US never helped the taliban militarily or recognized them diplomatically. look it up\n bin laden \n same with saddam. he wasn't seen as a terrorist. he was seen has fighting in afghanistan against the soviet invasion of afghanistan to liberate afghanistan. .\n milosovic\n lol. he wasn't a friend with bosnia at all! \n eastern europe \n did not help the allies against the nazi. they were actually satellite states and allies that provided troops for the nazi. (what history book are you reading?!?)\n\n Taliban, mugahadin, were backed both financialy and military, to fight against tha soviet invasion, damn, even stallone made a film about it, what are you being taught?\n Bin laden, he was trained and supplied by the U.S, its like saddam when he was needed, he was used, then suddenly, he is a terrorist, make up your minds.\n Milosevic, when he was needed to stop a war, he was a great diplomat and negotiator, once the war is over, the people who once embraced him now charge him with war crimes, america even backed him politically, christ you really dont know anything about this do you, you havent a clue of what happenned and what was negotiated.\n \n \na substantial of your charges are grossly historically inaccurate.\n the remainder would require someone with preconiscience because when saddam came to power, and bin laden fighting the soviet, no one thought them likely to go mad. this is why i charged you with being an end justifies the means, placing emphasis on outcome after the fact to judge the actions leading to the outcome.\n\n Ive had many arguments/discussions about this topic and one thing alsways happens, when people like you cant justify the actions or respond to any point, you resort to ridiculing, and even dismissing, this is quite normal for someone who doesnt really know what there talking about.\n \n What an absurd view on things, so your saying use people and dump them when they have served there usefullness. Its just amazing how you accuse someone of being a terrorist when you trained him and financed him, then be suprised when you turn your back on him and he retaliates.\n \n \nwho wants to be friends with america?\n i've already answered this one\n\n No you havent, you just ranted about some changing nonsence, and quoted obvious economics, you mentioned nothing about poiltics.\n \n \ndoes everyone wants to friends with the US, no. but in addition to the above there are others. thus i charged you with the error of generalizing from a part to the whole.\n\n You really dont understand the difference between economic and politics,, all the countries you stated are just economic \"friends\".\n \n \nmuch of what i posted is simple history and media reports\n nothing from any official government pronouncements. you charge of propaganda only betrays your own brainwashing by the peacemongers and america-haters, and your own gross ignorance of history.\n\n No, what you posted was your version of history, im afraid your a little of with your facts. Thats maybe what youve been taught in school, it may not be your fault, but i think you should start questioning what youve been taught. I noticed this over your past few posts, that your seeing things from an innacurate version of history. Half the things you state never happenned, or never happenned the way you believed them to have happenned, whichever, i think you should stop reading propoganda magazines and papers, and read a few encyclopedias, that way you will learn historical facts not propoganda fiction.\n \n I made specific points to you, i even reposted them more than 3 times, i even simplified them for you so you can understand them better, you never answered them, Obviously you cannot answer them so i wont bother reposting them, they were a bit tricky. \n \n I also made statements regarding international law amongst other things, you also completely ignored them to, if your just going to ignore the majority of my points and go into a political propoganda rant, there really isnt any point, im not discussing anythimg with you here your just attempting, badly, to justify an illegal war using propoganda, inaccurate historical facts and well, quite childish views.\n \n I would like to ask you, how old are you? i have a funny feeling you may still be in school.",

You dont honestly believe its the iraqis do you, your more niave than i thought.\n\n LOL\n who would have thought the iraqi would have looted their own national treasures? but read the news again, the charges of looting especially with the museum was over stated (the good stuffs had been locked away)\n and yes, iraqi national resources had to be protected because oil was needed for iraq's reconstruction and future. iraqi oil for iraq! gasp! how shocking is that? \n do show me the companies that have oil contract for iraqi oil? i would love to see it.\n \nreally, what about saudi arabia, kuwait, qatar, there all stable democratic countries, arent they? who are also very friendly with the U.S, they border iraq, arent they more central, more important? Why havent they been used as an example to secure a free and democratic ME. Arent they the shining example of ME democracy.\n\n stupid. they are not shinny example of ME democracy.\n \nThere was no violation of the ceasefire, iraq was complying with U.N resolutions, thats why the U.N security council didnt approve the invasion and thats why no wmds exist. Yes, the need for control of iraqi resources, mainly oil.\n\n more stupidity. iraq was found to be in violation not just with not allowing inpsection, but when the inspectors return they found the newly developed missiles exceed the limits of the aggreed to terms. violation.\n \nHuh, have i missed some part of history here, when was the soviet union confronted and defeated, when did this war take place, (dont mention the cold war)they just saw sense and threw out communism, you never defeated them, what is it revisionist history,lol.\n\n LOL indeed\n they just decided on their own to disband with no pressure from the west/US whatsover. that NK, vietnam, and afghanistan wasn't the west fighting the sino-soviet block through proxy. didn't you admitted that vietnam was supported by a \"superpower\"?\n or do you not believe proxy war real war? tell that to the dead.\n ignorant.\n and you call me a revisionist. LOL\n \nThere was no legal opportunity in iraq either, that didnt stop america, nothing is stopping america here except america, no oil.\n\n see everything i've already posted about legality and illegality of war.\n \nCongratulations, at least your being honest and consistent, im not sure wether that makes you a war monger or not, or even a self serving moralcrat, but that does make sense, the only problem is consistency.\n\n yet by your definition of consistency means that everything happens at once or in rapid succession without any real comprehension of priority and time. a snap shot in time is all you see, no wonder you have such an innovative sense of history!\n \nYes you can get oil almost anywhere? but at what price, controlling ME oil ensures a steady flow at a price thats suits americas economy, america relies on imported oil, it would up a creek without a paddle if a barrel reached $60. Or didnt you know that.\n\n LOL\n long before america is up a creek, europe and japan would have crashed economically because both are substantially more dependent on imported oil. \n \nHe bagan by helping the U.S, which america aknowledged and gave him support. both military, wmds and so on, america provided the funds and france and russia the hardware, look it up, you will see america funded the purchase of most of iraqs hardware. When he did his job and weakened iran, he wasnt needed anymore, the american aid stopped and iraq is left bankrupt after fighting the evil american enemy, iran. What does america do, nothing, turned there back on him, he wasnt needed any more. No wonder no middle east country trusts the U.S.\n\n again LOL. i have already stated that the major backers of saddam early on was the soviets, the french, and the german both militarily and economically. the US contribution was very minor in comparison. but being a minor contributor the US should carry primary responsibility. LOL.\n the US never encouraged saddam to fight iran. he saw and opportunity for gains and did it. since you make the charge, provide the proof?\n \nTaliban, mugahadin, were backed both financialy and military, to fight against tha soviet invasion, damn, even stallone made a film about it, what are you being taught?\n\n how ignorant can you be?! the taliban and the mujarhardeen are not one and the same. the US did support the Mujarhardeen in general, but not the taliban in particular. guilty by association?\n \nBin laden, he was trained and supplied by the U.S, its like saddam when he was needed, he was used, then suddenly, he is a terrorist, make up your minds.\n\n you must know the future then! great for you. no one at the time predicted that bin laden would become a terrorist. \n all you seem capable of doing is to judge the acts by the results. ends justify the means sort of guy. that if the end was bad, the means must have been bad as well. emoticon_rolleyes\n \nMilosevic, when he was needed to stop a war, he was a great diplomat and negotiator, once the war is over, the people who once embraced him now charge him with war crimes, america even backed him politically, christ you really dont know anything about this do you, you havent a clue of what happenned and what was negotiated.\n\n LOL. are you kidding me? he was president of serbia who was supporting the serbs activity in bosnia. ofcourse he had to be negotiated with, but negotiating with someone doesn't mean you back him or allies with him. guilty by association, eh? LOL\n \nIve had many arguments/discussions about this topic and one thing alsways happens, when people like you cant justify the actions or respond to any point, you resort to ridiculing, and even dismissing, this is quite normal for someone who doesnt really know what there talking about.\n\n because you have brought nothing to the discussion except the usual anti-american rants. and failed to demonstrated any comprehension when presented with the facts.\n i've justified the reasons for war. you haven't been able to counter any of it directly. any of it! you tried to drag in previous american actions and then you tried the chant the mantra of lies/oil/illegality. you haven't done anything but whine about the US.\n \nWhat an absurd view on things, so your saying use people and dump them when they have served there usefullness. Its just amazing how you accuse someone of being a terrorist when you trained him and financed him, then be suprised when you turn your back on him and he retaliates.\n\n simplistic. the point is that you ally with someone when you think you have similar goals. when this is no longer the case, the alliance should end. in case you don't know, this is the natural order of things whether it be an individual or a nation. in your scheme of things we should have supported saddam when he invaded kuwait because we supported him years before. by your reasoning for consistency we should still be supporting bin laden. emoticon_rolleyes\n \nNo you havent, you just ranted about some changing nonsence, and quoted obvious economics, you mentioned nothing about poiltics.\n \n You really dont understand the difference between economic and politics,, all the countries you stated are just economic \"friends\".\n\n you asked who would want to be friend with the US, i listed. now you specify politically be friends? emoticon_rolleyes\n believe it or not, economic is the primary motivator for friendships on the international scene. and every political system have always been about the regulations of humans as pertain to economics.\n but if you want a short list of nations who want to be friends with the US for political reasons, lets try: UK, canada, spain, australia, japan\n \nNo, what you posted was your version of history, im afraid your a little of with your facts. Thats maybe what youve been taught in school, it may not be your fault, but i think you should start questioning what youve been taught. I noticed this over your past few posts, that your seeing things from an innacurate version of history. Half the things you state never happenned, or never happenned the way you believed them to have happenned, whichever, i think you should stop reading propoganda magazines and papers, and read a few encyclopedias, that way you will learn historical facts not propoganda fiction.\n\n tell you what, generate a point by point list of where i was wrong and i'll consider it. all you have done thus far has been to generate the usual anti-american chants and when confronted, posted revisionist history\n that bin laden was a terrorist from the get go\n that the taliban and the mujarhardeen are one and the same\n that the soviet union decided without any pressure to dissolve.\n \nI made specific points to you, i even reposted them more than 3 times, i even simplified them for you so you can understand them better, you never answered them, Obviously you cannot answer them so i wont bother reposting them, they were a bit tricky. \n\n yeah, don't bother because i have responded to you point by point each and every time. but you just don't get it.\n provide proof like i've asked repeatedly? prove\n 1. the wmd lies (assuming you know what lies mean, an intent to deceive)\n 2. illegality\n 3. it was for oil\n i don't want your personal counter to my arguments, i want proof of your statements\n \nI also made statements regarding international law amongst other things, you also completely ignored them to, if your just going to ignore the majority of my points and go into a political propoganda rant, there really isnt any point, im not discussing anythimg with you here your just attempting, badly, to justify an illegal war using propoganda, inaccurate historical facts and well, quite childish views.\n\n LOL\n basically because i don't agree with your interpretation i don't get it\n LOL\n legality issues i have addressed time and time again\n what you don't seem to get that a general sentiment against war does not make it legal. legality requires a document. i've asked for a legal document against the war and you haven't produced one.\n all you have done is chanted the usual anti-war ****.\n and when i provided reasoning you called them propaganda and revisionist history without any proof to back up your own claims\n show me the proofs of your claims?\n \nI would like to ask you, how old are you? i have a funny feeling you may still be in school.\n\n LOL\n resorting to age check are we?\n so if you are older than you are wiser? and if you are younger you are still smarter? LOL\n what is next, sex checks?\n race checks?\n LOL\n \n i have a funny feeling you are delusional.\n \n put up or shut up\n proof?\n \n i am waiting.\n \n i will repond to proof, but you nonsense is tiresome.",

You assumed i was bashing americans, and you started the holier than though line, which has been used by people like you many times before, the simple fact which you dont understand, is people have nothing against americans, its the immoral foreign policy, ordinary joe american is a simple pawn used by american governments to achieve there ambitions, unfortunately average joe is too niave to see there being used and continuesly follow and belive what theyve been told, hence your misunderstood version of history.\n \n Now all that youve said ive heard many times before, you misread history and belive your right, thats not your fault, its what youve been taught, and i dont expect you to change your views, you cant as youve been brainwashed to believe the nonsense youve been told, thankfully not all americans think the way you do, luckily the majority do have the ability to think for themselves, and its good your in the minority.\n \n You still havent told me your age, i think its because you are still in school, only a child with no real knowledge can have views such as yours, or a completely brainwashed XXXXX.\n \n I posed you a few difficult question of which you could not answer, so you became defensive and started to attack me, there the actions of a juvenile who has been caught out. You also find what i have to say amusing, again you are dismissing what you cannot answer. I have already told you, twice, im not interested in your biased propoganda fuelled views, but you still respond with biased rantings, i can understand if you cannot answer my points, but the tone of your posts suggest you are getting angry and frustrated at you lack of understanding of the real world, so i suggest you try and improve your knowledge of world affairs, and try to understand what is being written.\n \n Ive also noticed a few other members are questioning your views, they are also asking you good question which you are finding difficult to answer, Youve even attempted to dismiss there views, dont you think you may be wrong.\n \n I think you may be able to help me, ill send you a pm.",

   "If you bomb,limit the trade and interfere with the leadership of a country I would assume that they hate you. It doesn't matter if the actions are justified or not, the average Iraqi would associate america with suffering. Their have been people imprisoned by saddam for years that still want nothing to do with the US.\n\n \n i think you will find the truth in iraq otherwise.\n the only and last poll in iraq from a few months ago suggested otherwise.\n reports from people in iraq suggests otherwise.\n \n consider this article\n \n* Iraqi public opinion remains largely favorable to reconstruction. This is certainly true of the vast bulk of the Kurdish and Shiite populations, but it is also true of many urban Sunnis (the bulk of that ethno-religious group). Most Iraqis don't particularly care to have so many foreigners in their country, but there is a widespread fear that if the United States were to leave Iraq, the country would slide quickly into chaos and civil war -- a fear amply justified by patterns on the ground. Consequently, most Iraqis do not want the United States to leave; they just want the United States to do a better job rebuilding their country. \n \n * Similarly, most of Iraq's leaders have shown great patience and urged their followers to cooperate with the U.S.-led reconstruction. They appear to recognize that the United States ultimately is striving to build the stable, prosperous, and pluralist nation they hope for. They also seem to realize that all of the alternatives to cooperation with the United States are much worse, and much less likely to produce their ideal outcome; thus they have generally counseled restraint despite repeated missteps by the United States. \n \n \n one sample link",

   "@fracas - That link makes the claim that the majority of Iraqis support america and it has polls, but these polls adress other issues for \n example \n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n A poll conducted in early October by the Iraqi Center for Research and Strategic Studies under the auspices of the International Republican Institute found that 60 percent of Iraqis felt \"not very safe\" or \"not safe at all\" in their neighborhoods, and virtually the same percentage had either \"not very\" [sic] or \"no\" confidence that coalition forces would make their cities safe. Only a little more than a quarter of those surveyed felt \"very safe.\" \n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n And there was another poll that if anything suggest that the iraqis hate americans\n \n =======================================================\n American forces in Iraq are obsessed with force protection and with tracking down the insurgents who are attacking them, and as a result they are providing little security to the Iraqi people. And the Iraqis know it: in the IRI poll taken in early October, only 7 percent said that coalition forces or coalition patrols contributed most to their sense of security\n ======================================================= \n \n Where does your link provide evidence that they would prefer americans to the french or the UN? It makes the reasonable claim that some Iraqis don't want the US to leave because the country will decay into civil war. But that does not mean there is not a large degree of anti-american/westerner/pagan \n sentiment in Iraq. I hope the US administration actually has a good idea about the opinions of Iraqis and uses this information to guide policy decisions. Hopefully all this \"were magnificent, only scum don't love us\" XXXXXXXX is just for the masses.",

   "@Close\n can you provide a link?\n \n anyone who believes all the world loves the US, only scums hate us is a fool and i certainly never suggested that.\n good objective data from iraq is hard to get in the west, but anedotal report by journalists and soldiers who returned in general have supported a postive attitude by many if not most iraqi toward america\n \n\"A lot of French journalists are ****,\" Wady, the sculptor, observed one afternoon as we shared a narghile filled with apple-flavored tobacco. \"They come here and talk against the U.S. in a stupid way. They don't care about the crimes of Saddam Hussein.\" And it's not only the French, noted Esam Pasha, a painter and translator for the U.S. military: \"European and Arab journalists talk to us, but they don't care about our happiness in being liberated. They only want us to make anti-American comments.\" Even a cabbie who took me to the Shabander one afternoon weighed in. \"Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabia TV, no good,\" he said. \"They only show pictures of bombings and killings of Americans -- always how things are bad in Iraq, never how they are getting better.\"\n \n Worse, I heard many stories at the Shabander about foreign correspondents staging news events to discredit the U.S. One young man introduced me to a Spanish photographer who, he later reported, had just finished posing an Iraqi woman in a nearby pile of rubble looking plaintively toward heaven, as if seeking deliverance from U.S. bombs. Rasim, the painter, claimed he witnessed Arab TV journalists pay idle Iraqis to light a car on fire and throw rocks to create an \"anti-American\" demonstration. \"These journalists come here with their minds already made up,\" he groused. \"They're not interested in anything that contradicts their anti-American viewpoint.\"\na reasonably ballanced article about the love-hate with america \n \n\"Yes, the occupation is a blessed and promising liberation for Iraq, even if the U.N., Europe, Russia, India, and all the Arabs say otherwise. The logic of international law could be of interest to the French, the Germans, the Russians and the Arabs, who are enamored with it... but not to us, the Iraqis. International law should not be of interest to us in any form or shape, because Saddam's dagger was dripping Iraqi blood, not Russian or Arab [blood]. Saddam's plague wreaked havoc with us, the Iraqis, not with the Arab League's minions, nor the Russians or the Chinese! The Iraqi tragedy, which exceeded any rational boundaries, was and continues to be at the epitome of its viciousness and degeneracy. \nfrom an expat iraqi \n \n interesting read on current iraqi politics \n \n unlike some, i will not generalize to the whole from a part\n but there are substantial evidence to suggest that the iraqi as a whole do not hate the US. that they are appreciative of liberation by the americans but are unhappy with the security issues, i.e. wishing the US would do a better job with security, not that the US should leave now",
