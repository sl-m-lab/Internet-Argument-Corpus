   "Saturday, July 30, 2005 \n \n LOVE IN ACTION CO-FOUNDER: 'MY MINISTRY SHATTERS LIVES '  \n \n by Wayne Besen \n \n \n FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n Saturday, July 30, 2005\n \n CO-FOUNDER OF MINISTRY THAT RUNS TEEN 'EX-GAY' BOOT CAMP SAYS GROUP SHATTERS LIVES AND CAN CAUSE SUICIDE\n \n Love In Action Co-Founder John Evans Unveils Powerful Letter Rebuking 'Ex-Gay' Ministries \n \n NEW YORK - Author Wayne Besen released an explosive letter today by Love In Action's co-Founder and former ex-gay John Evans, which rebukes gay conversion groups saying that they \"shattered lives\". The group he started has recently made headlines because it runs a boot camp for gay teens called \"Refuge\" that tries to turn adolescents heterosexual, often against their will.\n \n \"In the past 30 years since leaving the 'ex-gay' ministry I have seen nothing but shattered lives, depression and even suicide among those connected with the 'ex-gay' movement,\" Evans writes in his letter to John Smid, Love In Action's current director. \"I challenge Christians to investigate all sides of the issue of being gay and Christian. The Church has been wrong in the past regarding moral issues and I'm sure there will be more before Christ returns.\"\n \n Evans, a gay man, founded what may be the first modern ex-gay group in San Raphael, Calif. in 1973, along with a heterosexual preacher Kent Philpott. Evans left his life partner of ten years to start the gay conversion group. He later dropped out after he realized it didn't work and his best friend committed suicide because he could not turn heterosexual.\n \n \"Having the founder of Love In Action step forward to admonish the ministry he started speaks to the utter hopelessness and futility of these groups, not to mention the danger they represent,\" said Wayne Besen, Author of Anything But Straight: Unmasking the Scandals and Lies Behind the Ex-Gay Myth (Haworth, 2003). \"Most disturbing are the compulsory gay boot camps for teens which are tantamount to child abuse. They should immediately be shut down.\"\n\n \n Read the full text of article at the site below\n \n \n Wayne Besen.com",

   "I tend to agree, actually. An against-their-will \"boot camp\" (assuming that's what it really is and the claims by hateful gay-lobby groups are not exagerating) is a terrible way to help teenagers, no matter what the issue. Forcing kids to do something against their will is not a Christian thing to do at all, even if they think it is.",

However I don't think that's nearly as much of the focus of most Christian groups nowadays, but rather living a life learning to deal with inner feelings of homosexuality. What gay reactionaries refer to as the 'ex-gay' movement is no longer a comprehensive and accurate term to describe their message, for the most part anyway.

I have been following this story pretty closely because we know that Zack went into the program as self-identified \"gay\", I will be curious to see in six months or a year how he decides to identify.\n \n None of the studies ever done on the\"ex-gay\" movement have been documented science. There was no control groups, no pre-treatment interviews, no follow-up interviews six months, 1 year or more.\n \n If such a study was done we could once and for all, put this baby to sleep. We would have the answer based in science what effect good or bad these ministries have on people. \n \n My other issues with the notion that people can change the sexual identity is that all, I mean all, of these ex-gay groups are based in christianity. This says that the only people wishing to change are christians. The human body and mind is secular. And what I mean by that is that religion shouldn't be the only factor in changing sexual orientation. If it really can be changed, it should be able to be done without christ.

My grace came in the form of something even you have admitted to, that spiritual marriage is personal and between the couple and God. \n Even though I would never pigeon-hole myself as \"Chrsitian\" I know in my heart my partner and I are SPIRITUALLY MARRIED.\n But what I and so many other gays and lesbians are fighting for is FEDERAL RECOGNITION and EQUAL ACCESS to rights, protections and liberties granted LEGALLY MARRIED couples. \n The two are NOT the same. \n This is something I don't think even you have fully understood, nor are you willing to seperate them in anyway. \n That's where you get pegged as \"Anti-gay.\"",

   "Wow, that's pretty insulting.\n \n Suggesting that two gay men can't control their (for lack of a better word) \"instincts\" and would just have sex with eachother if placed in a room together is pretty narrow minded. Place a straight man and woman alone in a room and what do you get? Not necessarily \"[a] lot of sex.\"\n\n \n \n The truth is insulting? I have heard this first hand from several ex ex gays. The ex gay movement buddies up two gay men together in prayer groups and when they are alone one thing leads to another. I also have heard that the best place to cruise for anonymous sex is withing the ex gay movement.",

(that would include ex-gays, I wolud think)\n \n As the atmosphere and climate of society changes, I think you will find a lot less of that stuff happening. Gay men who are happy with being gay and have good self esteem don't tend to do that stuff. They are usually partnered and blahblah blah....\n \n Even in the \"heterosexual lifestyle\" (yes I said that to be funny) people who tend to be sexual careless tend to be people with self esteem issues. How can you expect gays to feel good about themslf when everywhere you turn some christian groups is saying crazy things about gays...\n \n I still don't understand how any gay man finds time to breathe. Between recruiting, stalking children, trying to infliltrate the governments and push agendas....where do they find the time to have 300 partners in a lifetime......",

Allow me to explain:\n \n You say \"Gays are spreading HIV at an alarming rate and not taking care to prevent the spread of the disease.\" This claim lumps all gay people together in a single group, and that is what leads to the problems with your conclusion.\n \n The reality of the situation is that there is a subculture of gay people who engage in irresponsible and unsafe sex, which leads to the spread of HIV. It is further true that most gay people are not part of this subculture. I don't really know anyone who engages in irresponsible sex, I don't know anyone with AIDS, and I certainly do not engage in irresponsible sex myself. Yet because of this subculture, the numbers are skewed. People generalize these numbers across all gay people, allowing them to make the blanket statement that \"gays are spreading HIV at an alarming rate\", when in reality not all gay people are doing so.\n \n And even more innaccurate is the idea that gays are \"not taking care to prevent the spread of the disease.\" Virtually every gay-themed organization preaches safe sex. I preach safe sex. I and every gay person I know practice safe sex. The majority of gay people are taking care to prevent the spread of HIV. But we are not the same people as those who spread the disease. We have no more influence over them than you do. Many gay people are doing what they can to stop irresponsible and unsafe sex, but those actions have little effect on the people who are actually causing the problem.\n \n The truth is insulting, this is true.
