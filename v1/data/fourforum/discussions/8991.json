   "Georgia is on the verge of regional authority elections. America sends money for Saakashvilin effort to built democracy here and those elections are seen as a litmus paper of democratic maturity of Georgia. \n Well I am Azeri man and I say - my relatives in Georgia still have a vague idea of what democracy is. This time it's 13 million dollars to coduct elections into local power structures. I fear that this big sum will be in hands of Georgian badly corrupted officials as always. And ordinary people will see nothing of it. Ordinary people are very poor and national minorities of Azeri people are the poorest of all in Georgia!\n Azerbaijanis in Kvamo-Kartly district of Georgia live as primed animals. 90% of them don't know Georgian and officials are reluctant ti educate them. Is democracy possible here? Locals can't practice their rights (to take part in elections, choose candidate). And even if elected they can't take part in management work for all official papers and all talks are in Georgian language. And they have poor knowledge of it. \n I think that by this way (human rights violence in Georgia) Tbilisi is trying to push Azerbaijanis out. At the beginning of 90th 1,2 mln Azerbaijanis lived in Georgia but in present times - 500 thousand only.\n I think that coming elections will not solve the problems of minority groups. Unfortunately we are living with Georgians in one country but only Georgians have advantage here. \n I think that Azeri people in Georgia would better boycott these elections to make West community look at the fact of human rights violation in Georgia.",
