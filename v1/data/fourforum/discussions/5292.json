Obviously they see the American economy as strong and healthy. This is the dynamic market economy in action.\n ======================\n \n Euro 'set to lose parity with dollar'\n By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard (Filed: 18/05/2005)\n \n The euro has begun a long-term slide and could drop below a dollar within 18 months, according to a client note issued yesterday by Morgan Stanley.\n \n The report, entitled Seven Reasons to Sell the Euro, warns that slumping growth and political crisis have started to take their toll on the eurozone.\n \n \"We are now witnessing the beginning of a bearish trend. Parity with the dollar could be broken within the next 18 months,\" said the note, written by eurozone economist Joachim Fels.\n \n Mr Fels said the euro was \"overvalued\" on the basis of purchasing power, while trend growth prospects for the region were half US levels. Global risk aversion as the credit cycle turns will tend to favour the dollar as a \"safe haven\".\n \n Mr Fels decried a rise in \"anti-capitalist sentiment\" in France and Germany, and warned that markets were still too complacent about likely turmoil if the EU constitution is rejected.\n \n \"Markets will have to come to grips with the insight that the single currency will not eventually be backed by a single government. This is why the euro will have to trade at a discount to the dollar and why it is unlikely ever to replace the greenback as the world's reserve currency,\" he said...\n \n (snip)\n \n http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2005/05/18/cneuro18.xml&menuId=242&sSheet=/money/2005/05/18/ixcity.html",

The value of the dollar and the Euro are after all based on the respective strenghts of their economies. The U.S. economy is doing fine and will do even better. Europe's big economies such as France, Germany and Italy are not. There hangs the tale.\nWhen the Euro was introduced in 1999, it's value against the dollar went into steady decline. It was around 1Euro = 0.85 dollars in September 2000. Then it recovered and since 2002 has been 1Euro < 1 dollar. The US dollar also collapsed against many other currencies (at times it's been near 2 dollars to 1 UK pound for example, when a few years back it was nearer 1.50 dollars to the pound). So are you accepting that the US economy has been weak in recent years? There is no sign of the dollar gaining against any currency save the Euro, so I guess we can conclude that the Eurozone is also weakening as the US economy did a few years back.\n \n I invite you to spew forth your usual drivel in an attempt to claim a wek dollar equals a strong US economy and a weak Euro means Germany and France are going bust. I know you can do it, just remember to not refer to reality as you do so and you will be fine.",

In the end there is no free lunch. Just look at France. They experimented with one unpaid holiday and the French went ballistic. They have this 35 hour workweek that is unsustainable. Italy is going into negative growth. Germany is doing somewhat better lately. If we had the problems of high unemployment that Europe has there would be blood in the streets.

If you actually want something nice you have to work for it, and socialist policies tend to mean that there is more of a difference between minimum wage and welfare.

I find it amusing that you try to refute such claims without even talking about how currencies are valued outside of their country specifically in markets that are independent on Amreica's economy. \n\n \n That would be becasue he has no idea. This is the guy who argued in the last week that the dollar is not REALLY low, because when you compare it to the basket of currencies upon which the Euro is based, it does not come out as such. The problem with this? The Euro is not based on a basket of currencies. It was fully convertible right out fo the gate\n \n Then he tried to backslide by claiming that what he REALLY meant was the basket of currencies upon which the Euro was originally based. Problem with this? There was no basket of currencies there, either. Then he said he meant the currencies that the Euro replaced. Problem there is that the curencies that the Euro replaced had their values fixed. They are permanently pegged to the euro at a fixed rate. Comparing them to the dollar would be stupid, since they are essentially dead currencies. And even if you DID choose to compare their value to that of the dollar, you could not possibly get the results he claimed, because they are permanently pegged to the euro, so if the Euro is up against the dollar, they are, too. \n \n Now he is all excited becuase he has found an article, based on a report from morgan stanley that flopped, that says the Euro might fall in value some. Since the germans and French have been fighting like hell to lower the value of the Euro, this is not especially surprising. Is the report correct? Possibly. we don't know, though I would not open any positions based on it yet. the big question for the Euro is whether or not the EU constitution will be accepted. If it is, we can expect to see the Euro climb. If not, we can expect to see some fall. Either way, the Euro is still widely viewed as a \"buy\". Also, either way, there are no expectations for a strengthening of the dollar. \n \n This part is especially funny:\n \n \n\"Markets will have to come to grips with the insight that the single currency will not eventually be backed by a single government. This is why the euro will have to trade at a discount to the dollar and why it is unlikely ever to replace the greenback as the world's reserve currency,\" he said.\n\n \n This is what makes the Euro desirable. It is a large issue, high value currency and it spreads the risk among several countries so the foolish actions of a single country cannot sink it. It has now becoma apparent that the EU is here to stay, regardless fo whether the constitution is passed or not. Nobody seems to be holding back trading because of lack of a single government backing. Additionally, nearly 20% of the worlds cash reserves at the national level are now being held in euros, and that amount is increasing daily. Nations are tired of seing their cash reserves devalued every year due to the fact that they are held in dollars.\n \n \n \nNot if you count the housing bubble, the low consumering saving, the huge debt, and the rising costs of medicare and SS. We got some real problems that need fixing and you don't seem to even want to talk about it. It is disturbing that people like you refuse to even admit that your country has a single problem. \n \n \n Housing bubble nothing. If you just subtract additional non value added military spending, including the war in Iraq, we have negative GDP growth. This is why GDP is a poor indicator of economic health in a non industrial country. All it does is count transactions and $s spent.\n \n People like MM are causing the actrive destruction of the United states. By refusing to admit that a problem exists, they are ensuring that nothing can or will be done to fix it. There is absolutly no question that the US is in some serious financial doo doo, the only issue is whether or not we will od anything at all to cushion the inevitable fall, or will we just run headlong off the cliff. It looks like the cliff is the way things are going to work out. Folks liek MM who not only refuse to acknowledge the problem either through ignorance or through som emisguided sense of patriotism are ensuring the economic failure of this country. We simply cannot go on like we have and end up with anything but a massive crash.",

   "Compare the current and past economic performance (for example economic growth, labour market participation rate, unemployment rate, labour productivity per person etc) of the scandinavian (nordic) countries to the southern european countries and you`ll find a rather large difference...

But at least it shows that socialism hardly equates economic failiure, nor that (more) laize fare equate economic prosperity. It is far more complicated than that.\n \n Waves rise and fall.

   "That would be becasue he has no idea. This is the guy who argued in the last week that the dollar is not REALLY low, because when you compare it to the basket of currencies upon which the Euro is based, it does not come out as such. The problem with this? The Euro is not based on a basket of currencies. It was fully convertible right out fo the gate\n \n (Snip)\n \n People like MM are causing the actrive destruction of the United states. By refusing to admit that a problem exists, they are ensuring that nothing can or will be done to fix it.

Folks liek MM who not only refuse to acknowledge the problem either through ignorance or through som emisguided sense of patriotism are ensuring the economic failure of this country. We simply cannot go on like we have and end up with anything but a massive crash.\n\n \n \n I was wondering when you would crawl out from under your rock. I have said and you ignore what I said about the Euro. What I said was that when one goes back into the historical value of the currencies making up the current Euro the value is approximately the same as what the value of the current Euro is now. \n \n This is all really a sideshow to detract from your hogwash about the dollar and the U.S. economy. Any damned fool would know that an economy expanding at twice the rate of the other combined economy (Europe) would be more economically viable . Your argument is that Latin is more viable than English. If Europe continues on with its socialist and counter productive policies it will inevitably wind up in the toilet. All one has to do is to look at the current levels of the unemployment and growth rates of the major European economies and compare that to the dynamism sand growth of the U.S. It is a slam dunk conclusion what are the facts. Here is a sampler:\n \n Economy - overview:\n \n The US has the largest and most technologically powerful economy in the world, with a per capita GDP of $40,100. In this market-oriented economy, private individuals and business firms make most of the decisions, and the federal and state governments buy needed goods and services predominantly in the private marketplace. US business firms enjoy considerably greater flexibility than their counterparts in Western Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant, to lay off surplus workers, and to develop new products. At the same time, they face higher barriers to entry in their rivals' home markets than the barriers to entry of foreign firms in US markets. US firms are at or near the forefront in technological advances, especially in computers and in medical, aerospace, and military equipment; their advantage has narrowed since the end of World War II. The onrush of technology largely explains the gradual development of a \"two-tier labor market\" in which those at the bottom lack the education and the professional/technical skills of those at the top and, more and more, fail to get comparable pay raises, health insurance coverage, and other benefits. Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to the top 20% of households. The response to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 showed the remarkable resilience of the economy. The war in March/April 2003 between a US-led coalition and Iraq, and the subsequent occupation of Iraq, required major shifts in national resources to the military. The rise in GDP in 2004 was undergirded by substantial gains in labor productivity. The economy suffered from a sharp increase in energy prices in the second half of 2004. Long-term problems include inadequate investment in economic infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of an aging population, sizable trade and budget deficits, and stagnation of family income in the lower economic groups.\n GDP:\n \n purchasing power parity - $11.75 trillion (2004 est.)\n GDP - real growth rate:\n \n 4.4% (2004 est.)\n GDP - per capita:\n \n purchasing power parity - $40,100 (2004 est.)\n ======================================\n European Union \n \n Economy - overview:\n \n Domestically, the European Union attempts to lower trade barriers, adopt a common currency, and move toward convergence of living standards. Internationally, the EU aims to bolster Europe's trade position and its political and economic power. Because of the great differences in per capita income (from $10,000 to $28,000) and historic national animosities, the European Community faces difficulties in devising and enforcing common policies. For example, both Germany and France since 2003 have flouted the member states' treaty obligation to prevent their national budgets from running more than a 3% deficit. In 2004, the EU admitted 10 central and eastern European countries that are, in general, less advanced technologically and economically than the existing 15. Twelve EU member states introduced the euro as their common currency on 1 January 1999. The UK, Sweden, and Denmark do not now participate; the 10 new member states may choose to adopt the euro when they meet the EU's fiscal and monetary criteria and the member states so agree.\n GDP:\n \n purchasing power parity - $11.65 trillion (2004 est.)\n GDP - real growth rate:\n \n 2.4% (2004 est.)\n GDP - per capita:\n \n purchasing power parity - $26,900 (2004 est.)\n \n http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html#Econ",

   "Then build more jails. More employment for the added prison guards. This is a \"win-win\" situation.\n\n \n Don`t be stupid. How much does a person in jail cost? How much has he costed society before he was caught? It`s far cheaper to have people living on grants than having them commit criminal acts and then locking them up. That ought to be self-evident. More prison guards only mean more paychecks to pay for. It`s obiously a loose-losse situation.\n \n \nIn all seriousness, I was reading an article in yesterday's WSJ about the need to build caskets for dying prisoners in U.S. prisons.
