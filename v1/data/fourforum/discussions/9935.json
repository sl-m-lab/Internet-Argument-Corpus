There are thousands of creation myths. Each has exactly as much evidence as Genesis for its truth: Somebody claims to have heard it from some God or other.

Actually, the Jews got it right long before: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. I've met atheists who don't believe in any God, but actually love God better than a lot of so-called believers. By their fruits shall ye know them.emoticon_xangel \n \n Oh, and according to Jesus, a lot of those who call themselves Christian are going to Hell, especially those who don't feed the hungry and thirsty and clothe the naked, of whom there are several billion at this moment.\n \n BTW, Feindslayer, what's a feind?",
