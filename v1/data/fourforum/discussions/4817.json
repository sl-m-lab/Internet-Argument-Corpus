   "US ambassador to Ireland giving talk on trans-atlantic relations tommorrow in my Uni. Any good ideas on questions I could ask?\n \n EDIT: I was thinking of a question about the role of NATO. Such as is it only relevant now as a means for the US to block greater EU security/defence co-operation in the effort to prevent the creation of a rival to the US?",

   "Not from his viewpoint. He'd blame Europe, not the unilateral US action, for lack of direct NATO participation in Iraq. Afghanistan's US puppet government has requested long-term security by US troops (since they control only about 15% of the country) and NATO has refused direct participation in peacekeeping, offering 10k troops as a security force for non-US humanitarian groups. The US is desperate for assistance in both countries and is trying to wedge our Afghanistan requirements against NATO (EU) desires. \n \n The US is pushing the EU hard for Turkey's membership as a palm leaf for putting Iraq's Kurds in a position of power.

I'm pointing out that the US will blame that change on Europe, and agreeing with you. I just can't see any point that will spark debate with a US diplomat. We're looking for people to blame and help correct our not yet admitted errors, not solid alliances. \n \n Turkey is a NATO member who might be in the market for military assistance with rebellious Kurds. EU membership would go a long way to ensure that aid and relieve possible future US participation. Just to show you how far we've backed ourselves into a corner, if Turkey's Kurds did align with Iraq's Kurds, who would the US support? I think that would be a leading question for your gathering.",
