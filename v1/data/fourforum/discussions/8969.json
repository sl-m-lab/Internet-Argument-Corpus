   "About a year ago there was a news story about how the 1918 Spanish flu virus (H1N1) had been reconstructed from scratch. A victim was found who had been buried in permafrost in Alaska, and enough of the virus was extracted to researchers to sequence the three remaining (unknown) plasmids that make up the virus. Five plasmids had been previously sequenced from other specimens. The eight plasmids were then injected into a living cell culture and they reassembled themselves into the virus and began to reproduce.\n \n Researchers reconstruct killer 1918 flu virus\n \n The purpose was to enable research into why this virus, also believed to be an avian virus, was so virulent. Well, now they have found out why. Researchers infected mice and have found that there is a severe immunological reaction to this virus causing severe inflamation. Studies have shown similar immunological reactions from the current Avian flu strain (H5N1). Research is continuing, but it seems possible that to develop appropriate drugs to supress the excessive inflamatory reaction in victims.\n \n Scientists find why Spanish flu was so deadly\n \n It is interesting that the 1918 Spanish flu was more lethal in young adults rather than the young or the old. The hypothesis is that children have less developed immune systems and old people tend to have weakened or more repressed immune systems and therefore escaped the severe inflamation.\n \n By the way, the polio virus has also been artificially reconstructed. Of course, since it is exclusively a human disease, it hasn't been tested, but it cannot be distinguished from the real thing.",

   "I think this was pretty much known at the time.\nNope. It wasn't.\n \nI read a book in the mid-'90s that offered this very explanation- before the virus was reconstructed.\nAnd you think that the mid 90s was the \"time\" of the Spanish flu?\n \nKnowing what the virus looks like does not necessarily tell us how it works.\nBut that's not the point. Knowing how it works tells us how it works. What do you think the point of the research is?\n \nThere was some speculation that the Swine flu of the late 1970s was a close cousin of the Spanish flu- if not the Spanish flu itself.\nNope. It wasn't. Both have been sequenced and they aren't the same.\n \nOne of my aunts died shortly after getting the Swine flu vaccine- which is commonly believed to be deadly in itself.\nReally? Of what did she die?\n \nAnyone see the irony in the worldwide hub-bub over AIDS when the Spanish flu killed more people in 25 months than AIDS has in 25 years?\nWhat does AIDS have to do with avian flu? Wait! I know! You think that AIDS is a disease of those sinful homosexuals. Did you include Africa and Asia in your numbers?",
