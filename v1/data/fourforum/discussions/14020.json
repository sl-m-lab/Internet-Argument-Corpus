My previous Accord went 375,000 miles before I gave it to my son.\n \n Try doing either with an American car.\n\n \n Here's a public awareness bulletin for you in case your Tacoma is one of the trucks with its farme falling apart:\n \n\n Hi, folks, your friends at Toyota Motor Sales, here. We thought that we should bring to your attention a customer support program we're announcing today to extend warranty coverage on the frames of Toyota Tacoma trucks from model year 1995 through 2000.\n \n We've received reports that on a small number of Tacomas, frames may develop corrosion that goes beyond the normal surface rust that's commonly found on metal after years of exposure. This corrosion may extend to actual perforation of the frame's metal.\n In response, we're extending the rust-perforation warranty covering these trucks for a period of 15 years from each vehicle's original date of purchase, with no mileage limitation, for corrosion that results in perforation of the vehicle's frame material. \n \n If you own one of these vehicles and you find that its frame may exhibit excessive corrosion to the point of metal perforation, we suggest that you take it to a Toyota dealership when you receive your notification letter so that it can be inspected. If inspection confirms frame corrosion damage perforation, we will either repair the vehicle or repurchase it. \n Keep in mind that this is not a recall. Rather, it's an example of our commitment to our owners. \n \n For a more detailed explanation of the situation, and of our repurchase program, please visit Toyota's Open Road at Newsroom : Our Point of View / Toyota.\n \n\n \n Funny, I don't \"recall\" (pun intended) any comparable announcements being made about the Ford F-150. \n \n As for your Accord, I'm guessing that you don't live in the salt belt because if you did, your Accord would be considerably lighter after the fenders rusted off well before 375k miles.

LOL\n \n I can't count the number of bye runs there are at a typical ricer race.\n\n \n I would say his car is doing just fine after that race. Or if you look up supra vs lambo that is another supra which is extremely fast, street legal, and was able to drive back home afterward. Or recently on Pinks there was some crappy Mitsubishi that beat some really fast cars and then drove back home afterward.\n \n To me a ricer is someone who thinks their car is fast when it just isnt. Or someone who only modifies their cars looks and not their cars performance.",

The 1979 2.3 turbo started on 132 hp with a 2 bbl carb, and by the late '80s was putting out 200 hp in the SVO Mustangs. However, cheap gas prices in the '90s meant this avenue was left fallow for too long.\n \n As a sign of American ingenuity STS turbo systems have an aftermarket set up mounted at the back of the car, routing exhaust gases under pressure into the engine, lowering underhood temps and not taking up space. It's pretty tight under the hood of most modern cars so this is a good development.:)",
