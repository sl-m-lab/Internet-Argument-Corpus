   "Nigerian Islamic court orders amputation \n \n Kano, Nigeria \n \n \n \n 19 September 2005 01:46 \n \n Nigerian Islamic judges have ordered that a teenager from Niger have his hand cut off after he confessed to stealing a motorbike, court officials said on Monday.\n \n This is thought to be the first time that a foreign national has been sentenced to amputation since northern Nigeria began to reintroduce sharia, the strict Islamic legal code, in 1999.\n \n Lawal Usman (19), from the Niger district of Maradi, was convicted under sharia law in the northern city of Katsina on Friday, court registrar Nasir Darma said.\n \n A presiding judge at the Katsina Upper Sharia Court Three, Mustapha Sani Saulawa, ruled that Usman should have his right hand amputated at the wrist. The convict has 30 days to appeal the sentence.\n \n \"It does not matter where the offence was committed. Since he was arrested here, he is liable,\" Saulawa said, according to the registrar.\n \n Many thousands of villagers have fled the Maradi region of Niger for nearby Nigeria following four years of drought, famine and locust swarms.\n \n Usman was charged on August 23 2005 after Nigerian police stopped him during a routine traffic check and found him he could not produce ownership documents for his motorbike.\n \n During interrogation, Usman told the police he stole the bike from his village.\n \n The implementation of Islamic law in mainly Muslim northern Nigeria -- and in particular the use of amputation -- has been criticised by Nigeria's federal government and human rights activists. -- Sapa-AFP \n \n \n \n \n \n http://www.mg.co.za/articlepage.aspx?area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__africa/&articleid=251387\n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1320 \n Polio cases on the rise in Muslim countries\n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1285\n The Fascism of Shariah: Islamic Court Orders Man to be Surgically Blinded \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1282 \n The Fascism of Sharia: Pakistani Rape Victim must find four male witnesses to prove she was raped \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1275 \n The Fascism of Sharia: Rape victim forced to marry her father-in-law rapist \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1215 \n Men who were told to 'gang rape' by Sharia court acquitted \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1157 \n The Fascism of Sharia: girls as young as nine sentenced to death \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1154 \n The Fascism of Sharia: Woman to be stoned to death for \"adultery\" \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1149 \n The Fascism of Sharia: Mentally-ill girl sold for sex condemned to death \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1113 \n Comparing the Rhetoric of Jihadism and Nazism \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/959 \n Silence of the Leftist Media: Nary a word about girl hanged for \"sharp tongue\" \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/942 \n Islamic Honour Killings: Iranian Court Release man who stabbed wife to death in courtroom \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/911 \n The Fascism of Sharia: Six Await Amputation in Nigeria \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/845 \n Indian Muslims fight for shariah law to allow pre-teen marriages \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/841 \n If Islam does not conform with reality, change reality until it conforms with Islam \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/685\n Old Islamic Laws Trigger New Round of Debate \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/592 \n UN Votes: Islam is incompatible with democracy 403 to 267 \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/2 \n The Clash Of Civilizations And The Great Caliphate",

   "It was good enough for Republican lobbyists and politicos.\n \n http://blog.dccc.org/mt/archives/003580.html\n \n\n Grover Norquist put his considerable political skills in the service of such Islamists as Abdurahman Alamoudi and Sami al-Arian. The former was then the driving force behind the American Muslim Council, or AMC. At the time, Alamoudi's Council was arguably the pre-eminent Islamist front group in America. The AMC's success at dissembling its true purposes was underscored when a spokesman for FBI Director Robert Mueller described it in 2002 as the \"the most mainstream Muslim group in the United States.\" Today, both Alamoudi and al-Arian are in jail on terrorism-related charges. \"The September 2003 arrest of Alamoudi was a severe blow to al-Qaida, as Alamoudi had a close relationship with al-Qaida and had raised money for al-Qaida in the United States.\"\n\n \n\n Shortly after 9/11, Abramoff signed up as a lobbyist for this consortium of banks that operate according to sharia, or Islamic law. According to the National Journal (Aug 31, 2002), the consortium was created after the attacks as President Bush began cracking down on terrorist financing. You see, Kamel is also the chairman of Dallah al Baraka Group (DBG), which is suspected of having ties to al Qaeda and other extremist groups, and he was also the co-founder and large shareholder of Al Shamal Bank in Sudan, Osama bin Laden's bank of choice from 1983 onward. Kamel's name also appeared in the \"Golden Chain,\" a roster seized by Bosnian authorities in Sarajevo in March 2002 listing Saudi donors to bin Laden and his associates\n\n \n \nDavid H. Safavian, the Bush administration official arrested Monday, initially failed to disclose lobbying work he had done for several controversial foreign clients when he went before a Senate panel last year to be confirmed as chief of the White House's federal procurement office. Safavian did not disclose his firm's representation of the men until questioned in writing by the committee's staff, and initially failed to tell the panel he had registered as a foreign agent for two controversial African regimes.\n\n \n \n \n And I really have to give Kudos to whomever left this feedback:\n \n \n\n \"When the Muslim College, a London-based center of Islamic learning, held a seminar for Muslim, Christian and Jewish conservatives, the participants had a shock of self-recognition, says Zaki Badawi, an Egyptian religious scholar who heads the college. Suddenly, they realized they shared attitudes and world views. Whatever their stripe, fundamentalists are absolutists at heart, says Badawi. 'They don t like to hear other ideas at all. They want to hear their own voice, and are suspicious of anyone else's.'\"\n \n Sound familiar? \n\n \n http://allspinzone.blogspot.com/2005/01/michael-chertoff-where-questions.html",

   "That would be three votes in favor of mutilation as a criminal punishment.\n\n \n Nope, that would be three votes aginst jsaid2009's approach to the issue. If you changed your ways, you'd get better results. Sensible discussions, and maybe a nod or two.\n \n Mutilation punishments are obsolete. Most of the world has moved away from them. We all agree. The problem is that they were present in an awful lot of cultures and religions, not just Islam. And they have been abandoned in an awful lot of cultures - including some Islamic ones. Islam and corporal mutilation are thus shown not to be inseparable.\n \n In my oppinion, all religion should be strictly limited to the private lives of people. As religions are so spread out currently, that does indeed mean I believe they should be subjected to limitations. All of them, including Islam. However, I can also see that attacking a religion (or any social group) is counterproductive, as it simply makes people pull together and allows fundamentalism to prosper.\n \n In a whole host of European countries, you can find modernized muslims. They abstain from pork, they pray five times a day and so on. But they no longer treat \"their\" women as property, lock them behind walls and wrap them into 6 layers of cloth to hide their sexuality.They work to make ends meet, and recognize that a good education for their children, of both sexes, is a good thing. They also no longer demand thieves' hands be cut off. When they see a fundamentalist they are embarassed, just like most christians are by godhatesfags.com. When a brother kills a sister for being \"a slut\", they are horrified.\n \n But along comes jsaid2009 and starts screaming at them about how evil they are. And suddenly, the Islamic fundamentalist too once again has an audience...\n \n You getting any of this?",

   "Josef, you really don't get it, do you?\n \n There's nothing to refute. No one here says mutilation punishments are good. Rather, the way in which you presented the issue drew variously formed opposition. At that point, the topic's point shifted to your methods.\n \n I have already explained my views. I pointed out that Islam is like Christianity was in the past, I pointed out that you are singling out Islam, and I pointed out that moderate muslims exist. I explained that this is why your approach to the issues fails.\n \n Your answer to this was, essentially \"I know what I'm talking about, you don't. Multiculturalism has failed. Islam is irredeemable.\"\n \n How do you refute that? While I do see that multiculturalism is encountering difficulties, I fail to see how it has failed. While I do see that the Quran (arguably) does not recognize separation of state and religion, neither did the Bible, and yet subsequent changes of interpretation (including Jesus' \"unto emperor wht is emperor's) have changed it. I can also see the even without it, an awful lot of muslims do live in secular or non-islamic states and yet obey their authority, so reinterpretation has evidently already occured, at least to some degree. So how do I refute something that has no supporting arguments, just one Josef Said's statement? I can't, because the traditional response leads to \"Does too! Nyah nyah nyah nyah!\". If that's the way you want to play, allow me to see your four fiqhs with the KJV bible and raise you with my life in the balkans AND visits to several islamic states, where peaceful coexistence of multiple cultures was shown to be possible, provided extremism was kept under control by the state. \n \n As for Jorg Haider, you introduced him as an example of nazis holding high positions in Europe. And to this I responded, pointing out that extreme right parties do exist in Europe, are all softened compared to NSDAP practices, and are only fringe parties, getting into governments only as part of \"pacts with the devils\", with the majority in the coalition holding them in check. And then, I also pointed out thet the rhetoric of these, who you for some reason introduced as negative examples, strongly resembles your own.\n \n \n As for tolerance of the intolerant: I don't stand behind tolerance for the intolerant. That's why I oppose your viewpoints on this forum, after all. I see the state as having one primary function - allowing the ordered coexistence of its citizens. All other functions, including social services and similar, can be derived from this. Consequently, the state has to prevent extremist acts, and limit extremist positions to a point where they do not lead to extremist acts. All of extremisms, both islamic, counterislamic, antisemitic and all the other extremisms we encounter. And this is where you come in: your actions do not indicate a moderate, concerned by extremism. They indicate an extremist railing agaist opposing extremists. As stated above, both are to be condemned.",
