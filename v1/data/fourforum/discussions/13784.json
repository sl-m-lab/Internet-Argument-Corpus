   "In states that have enacted bans against gay marriage.\n \n Divorce rates of traditional marriages are on the rise in such states, while declining in states which allow gay marriage:\n \nNate Silver at FiveThirtyEight has an interesting little post up today suggesting that states with constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage are more likely to have higher divorce rates. Silver uses statistics from the CDC to show that from 2003 until 2008, states with no constitutional ban on same-sex marriage experienced an average 8 percent decrease in divorce rates. Meanwhile, states that have enacted constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage saw an average 1 percent increase in divorce rates over that time. Massachusetts, the first state to legalize same-sex marriage, has the lowest divorce rate in the nation, followed by Rhode Island, New Mexico and Maine - three states that don't have constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage. The seven states with the largest increase in the divorce rate during the five-year period all have constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage.\n\n Instant Tea Blog Archive Divorce rates higher in states with amendments banning gay marriage\n \n Check out the stats at the above link.",

They did shameful things with each other, and what has happened to them is punishment for their foolish deeds.\n \n \n Above are several examples of sometime minor sometimes significant changes.

The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. (v. 4) For he (the reigning authority) is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of God's wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.\" (Also note Matthew 5:25; Acts 25:10-11)\n \n God has commanded the church to make correct judgments:\n \n John 7:24: \"Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment.\"\n \n Matthew 18:15-17: \"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses (note Deuteronomy 19:15). If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector .\"\n \n God commands us to judge according to one's 'fruits.'\n \n Matthew 7:17-20: \"Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.....every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.\"\n \n Saints of Christ will judge the world, and angels:\n \n I Corinthians 6:2: \"Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?\"\n \n I Corinthians 6:3: \"Do you not know that we will judge angels?\"\n \n Jesus condemned the teachers of the law and the Pharisees:\n \n Matthew 23:27-28: \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.\"\n \n John the Baptist rebukes King Herod for adultery and other sins:\n \n Luke 3:19: \"But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other things he had done, Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.\" \n \n Stephen rebukes the Jewish leaders:\n \n Acts 7:51-53: \"You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit!  Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him - you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.\" \n \n Also note all the Old Testament prophets who condemned sin and corrupt moral leadership, and who were persecuted for their discernment and duty.\n \n I really recommend you repent and receive Christ before you perish. \n \n John 14:6",

   "They were guilty of all sorts of crimes against man and nature and paid for it.\n\n \n soulforce.org\n \n \n \n GENESIS 19:1-14\n THE STORY OF SODOM\n \n Now let's consider the second biblical text used by some people to condemn God's gay children. You remember the ancient story of Sodom. First, what does the story of Sodom in Genesis 19 say about God?\n \n When Gary and I arrive at a college or university to speak, there are often protesters carrying signs that read, \"Mel White, Sodomite.\" (Has a nice ring to it.) Actually, I'm not from Sodom. That city was buried beneath the Dead Sea centuries ago. I'm from California -- but perhaps that just confirms their suspicions!\n \n Once again, this story is not primarily about sex. It is primarily about God. Some people say the city of Sodom was destroyed because it was overrun by sexually obsessed homosexuals. In fact, the city of Sodom had been doomed to destruction long before. So what is this passage really about?\n \n Jesus and five Old Testament prophets all speak of the sins that led to the destruction of Sodom -- and not one of them mentions homosexuality. Even Billy Graham doesn't mention homosexuality when he preaches on Sodom.\n \n Listen to what Ezekiel 16:48-49 tell us: \"This is the sin of Sodom; she and her suburbs had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not help or encourage the poor and needy. They were arrogant and this was abominable in God's eyes.\"\n \n Today, heterosexuals and homosexuals alike do well to remember that we break God's heart when we spend all we earn on ourselves, when we forget the poor and hungry, when we refuse to do justice or show mercy, when we leave strangers at the gate.\n \n I admit, there are a lot of gay folk who are Sodomites (and a lot of straight folk as well). Sodomites are rich and don't share what they have with the poor. Sodomites have plenty and want more. While millions are hungry, homeless, and sick, Sodomites rush to build bigger homes, buy bigger cars, and own more property -- putting their trust in safer stock portfolios and more secure retirement accounts.\n \n Whatever teaching about sexuality you might get out of this passage, be sure to hear this central, primary truth about God as well. God has called us do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with our Creator. Sodom was destroyed because its people didn't take God seriously about caring for the poor, the hungry, the homeless, or the outcast.\n \n But what does the story of Sodom say about homosexual orientation as we understand it today? Nothing.\n \n It was common for soldiers, thieves, and bullies to rape a fallen enemy, asserting their victory by dehumanizing and demeaning the vanquished. This act of raping an enemy is about power and revenge, not about homosexuality or homosexual orientation. And it is still happening.\n Louima\n Louima\n \n In August 1997, Abner Louima, a young black immigrant from Haiti, was assaulted by several police officers after he was arrested in Brooklyn. Officer Charles Schwarz held Louima down in a restroom at the precinct, while Officer Justin Volpe rammed a broken stick into Louima's rectum. These two men and the three other officers involved in this incident and its cover-up were not gay. This was not a homosexual act. It was about power.\n \n The sexual act that occurs in the story of Sodom is a gang rape -- and homosexuals oppose gang rape as much as anyone. That's why I believe the story of Sodom says a lot about God's will for each of us, but nothing about homosexuality as we understand it today.",

   "Since you want to use explanations of the Bible in place of the Bible, here's what two Jewish philosophers from ancient Israel said about Sodom:\n \n\n \"As men, being unable to bear discreetly a satiety of these things, get restive like cattle, and become stiff-necked, and discard the laws of nature, pursuing a great and intemperate indulgence of gluttony, and drinking, and unlawful connections; for not only did they go mad after other women, and defile the marriage bed of others, but also those who were men lusted after one another, doing unseemly things, and not regarding or respecting their common nature, and though eager for children, they were convicted by having only an abortive offspring; but the conviction produced no advantage, since they were overcome by violent desire; and so by degrees, the men became accustomed to be treated like women, and in this way engendered among themselves the disease of females, and intolerable evil; for they not only, as to effeminacy and delicacy, became like women in their persons, but they also made their souls most ignoble, corrupting in this way the whole race of men, as far as depended on them\" Philo, Jewish philosopher 20 BC - 50 AD\n\n \n \n\n \"About this time the Sodomites grew proud, on account of their riches and great wealth; they became unjust towards men, and impious towards God, in so much that they did not call to mind the advantages they received from him: they hated strangers, and abused themselves with Sodomitical practices\" \"Now when the Sodomites saw the young men to be of beautiful countenances, and this to an extraordinary degree, and that they took up their lodgings with Lot, they resolved themselves to enjoy these beautiful boys by force and violence\" Josephus, Jewish historian \n",

LOL!\n\n \n Um, you do not get to assign attributes to me. \n \n Yes, I voted for and him and given the same options would do so ago. Had it been the slightly more moderate McCain of five years prior to the election and had he had a running mate with a brain, I may have voted differently. Obama was never my first choice - Bill Richardson was. As to loving the man - hardly, I don't know him. As to his presidency, I have liked some of what he has done, but not all. Have pretty much felt the same way about every president we have had. I don't belong to political clubs - I do my own thinking and who I will vote for next will depend on the candidates. The only politicians I have truly adored were Paul Wellstone and Bob Dole.\n \n As to the government - would much rather have them meddling with my pocket book than my personal life.",

   "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's.

But the Constitution is what this country is founded on, so naturally laws should reflect it. If you personally choose to live your life in accordance to the bible, that's fine.

   "If you personally choose to live your life in accordance to the bible, that's fine. But the Bible, like many other foreign documents, has no place in politics. Religious influence in government is highly un-American.\n \n\n \n It's amazing how little you godless heathens have studied the writings of the founding fathers.\n \n Here are just some of the facts that are seldom taught in America's public school classrooms:\n \n The most frequently recognized source for political inspiration for the founding fathers was the Bible, which was referenced in some 34% of the founding father's quotations.\n \n The first reference to God as the foundation of an American colony was noted in the 'Mayflower Compact,' dated November 11, 1620:\n \n \"....Having undertaken for the Glory of God, and advancement of\n the Christian faith, and the honour of our king and country, a\n voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia;\n Do by these presents, solemnly and mutually in the presence of\n God and one another, covenant and combine ourselves together\n into a Civil Body....\"\n \n Many of the founding fathers recognized that the principles of civil law were inseparably linked to Biblical truths. James Wilson, one of the original Supreme Court Justices, and a signer of the Constitution, explained,\n \n \"Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is divine...Far from being rivals or enemies, religion and law are twin sisters, friends, and mutual assistants...\"\n \n Additionally, the United States Supreme Court specifically recognized America as a Christian nation. In the case \"Church of the Holy Trinity vs. the United States\" (Feb. 29, 1892, US457-458), Justice Josiah Brewer, following a lengthy and exhaustive search of early American historical literature, commented, \"We find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth....that we are a Christian nation....\"\n \n In another Supreme Court Case, \"Zorach vs. Clauson\" (1952, US306 307 313), Justice William O. Douglas categorically stated, \"We are a religious people and our institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.\" Further, in \"United States vs. Macintosh\" (1931, 283 US 605, 625), Justice George Sutherland affirmed, \"We are a Christian people....affording to one another the equal right of religious freedom, and acknowledge with reverence the duty of obedience to the will of God.\"\n \n At the Constitutional Convention on June 28, 1787, Benjamin Franklin noted: \"...The longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that 'except the Lord build the House, they labor in vain that build it.\"\n \n There are many today who believe Franklin was a strict deist, but Franklin here is not only referencing the Bible, but is alluding in part to a teaching by Jesus Christ from Matthew 10:29.\n \n Concerning the outcome of the American Revolution, John Quincy Adams noted, \"The highest glory won from the American Revolution was this: it connected, in one indissoluble bond, the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity.\"\n \n In a letter to Thomas Jefferson dated June 28, 1813, John Adams wrote: \"The general principles on which the (founding) fathers achieved independence were...the general principles of Christianity.\"\n \n Founding father Noah Webster proclaimed much the same message when he said, \"The religion which has introduced civil liberty is the religion of Christ and His Apostles...This is genuine Christianity and to this we owe our free constitutions of government.\"\n \n Time after time, the founding fathers declared similar beliefs. From the archives of Patrick Henry's personal notes (handwritten on the back of his copy of the \"Stamp Act Resolutions,\" made public after his death) we read:\n \n \"Whether this (new government) will prove a blessing or a curse\n will depend upon the use our people make of the blessings which\n a gracious God hath bestowed on us. If they are wise they will be\n great and happy. If they are of a contrary character, they will be\n miserable. Righteousness alone can exalt them as a nation.\"\n \n Thomas Jefferson was hardly speaking from a strict deist standpoint when he said:\n \n \"Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have\n removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the\n people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are\n not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my\n country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice\n cannot sleep forever.\" (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781)\n \n \"I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we\n are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their\n native land and planted them in a country flowing with all\n the necessities and comforts of life.\" (Monday, March 4,\n 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address)\n \n Remember, a strict deist was one who believed God was like a watchmaker, who wound up the universe and thereafter did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. Jefferson obviously believed otherwise.\n \n Speaking of Godly principles, Jefferson stated:\n \n \"A more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have never\n seen; it is a document in proof that I am a real Christian,\n that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus.\"\n (Jan. 9, 1816 - In a letter to Charles Thomson)\n \n George Washington, the \"Father of our Country,\" likewise recognized God as supremely important in the American dream. In his first inaugural address on April 30, 1789, Washington remarked:\n \n \"It would be improper to omit, in this first official act, my\n fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over\n the universe.\"\n \n On Saturday, October 3, 1789, President Washington said this in proclaiming a day of national thanksgiving:\n \n \"It is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the Providence of\n Almighty God.\"\n \n Today, our public schools are in a moral crisis. Washington once noted, \"If you remove religious principles from the schools you are going to lose national morality.\" How prophetic he was!\n \n Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was also known as the \"Father of Public Schools,\" once had this to offer: \"The only foundation for a republic is...religion. Without it there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty.\"\n \n Don't miss the significance of that last statement: \"..without virtue there can be no liberty....\" The principle is clear - a lack of virtue engenders bondage. As one writer noted, \"Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters (bindings).\" The more liberties a godless people achieve, the more enslaved they ultimately become in their worldly obsessions.\n \n Still another founding father, the Reverend John Witherspoon, mirrored Benjamin Rush when he declared, \"...Civil liberty cannot long be preserved without virtue....\"\n \n And finally, let's not forget James Madison, known as the \"Chief Architect of U.S. Constitution,\" who once had this to say:\n \n \"Cursed be all that learning that is contrary to the Cross of Christ.\"\n \n This is just a very short list of thousands of such examples that clearly speak of the Biblical and Christian foundations of our Founding Fathers and early America. Along with these there were the church services in government buildings up to and shortly after the civil war; paid chaplains, government authorized missionaries, reliefs of Moses and the Ten Commandments in the Supreme Court building, and so on and so forth. Whatever moral foundations apart from Christian and Biblical principles one may argue was second, was not even a close second. The record on that is clear.\n \n And so today, the debate over the moral foundations of America continues, but not in this quarter. America is in a moral and spiritual decline due to the ungodly secularization of this country. \"Thou shalt not\" has been replaced with, \"If it feels good do it.\" The wisdom of God has been replaced with the tenets of men; absolute truths replaced with moral relativism, and \"Father God\" has been replaced with \"Mother Earth.\" America is now paying the price for this ill-conceived venture. The remedy: A return to Godly values and principles, upon which this nation \"of the people, by the people, and for the people,\" was clearly founded. (RighterReport.com)",
