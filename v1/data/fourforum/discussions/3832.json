True tolerance grants people the right to dissent.\n \n It is very important that a Christian criticized for intolerance asks his accuser what he means by &#8220;intolerance.&#8221; The accuser will probably say something like &#8220;not being accepting of another&#8217;s beliefs.&#8221; To this the Christian can gently respond, &#8220;But you are not being accepting of my position.

   "\"Don&#8217;t Laugh at Me\" sent ripples through the culture in 1999 and led to a Country Music Award nomination for \"Song of the Year.\" That same year another well-known musical group recorded the song with some additional lyrics. Here is a snippet with the addition:\n \n I&#8217;m fat, I&#8217;m thin, I&#8217;m short, I&#8217;m tall\n I&#8217;m deaf, I&#8217;m blind, yes, I think in a way, we&#8217;re all\n I&#8217;m black, I&#8217;m white and I am brown\n I&#8217;m Christian, I&#8217;m Jewish, and I am Muslim\n I&#8217;m gay, I&#8217;m lesbian, I&#8217;m American Indian\n I&#8217;m very, very young, I&#8217;m quite aged\n I&#8217;m very wealthy, I&#8217;m very, very poor\n \n Don&#8217;t laugh at me\n Don&#8217;t call me names\n Don&#8217;t get your pleasure from my pain\n In God&#8217;s eyes we're all the same\n Someday we&#8217;ll all have perfect wings\n Don&#8217;t laugh at me\n \n This song speaks to a need in our present culture of prejudice and hate. In fact, this song, including the addition, is used as part of a \"tolerance\" education program by Education World, a subsidiary of one of the largest providers of learning management solutions in the world.\n \n I can relate to this song, especially when reflecting on my teen years. Having divorced parents, I often felt taunted and weak to the blows of insulting peers. There was little refuge. I wanted others to realize that I did not choose my lot in life, but it was handed to me by the poor choices of others. If anything, I needed restoration, not humiliation. I believe most people can relate to these experiences in some way. The bullies sometimes seem to have the last word. This song speaks well to that issue.\n \n But in trying to speak to a need, the song over-speaks itself. The categories listed in this song range from ethnicity, to religion, to morality, to economics, to age, to body shapes. But the problem enters when it equates the conditions of each of these. This is evident in the last lines, \"In God&#8217;s eyes we&#8217;re all the same/Someday we&#8217;ll all have perfect wings.\"\n \n That statement smuggles in the idea that all the categories listed previously do not ultimately matter. Instead of merely speaking against abuses, the song has overstepped its bounds and made blurry judgments about morality and religion.\n \n While we should not be laughing at people who disagree with us or are different from us, we should also not consider that God smiles happily down on all belief systems and certain immoral decisions. Ethnicity and economics are indifferent to the most important ideas in life. Morality and religion are not.\n \n I believe that when people often talk about \"tolerance\" they are meaning \"love.\" And when we speak out about confusion over tolerance, some people only hear, \"I don&#8217;t care about love.\" \n \n This would be a false dichotomy.\n \n RZIM.org",

Here is the whole, original song by Mark Wills:\n \n I'm a little boy with glasses\n The one they call the geek\n A little girl who never smiles\n 'Cause I've got braces on my teeth\n And I know how it feels\n To cry myself to sleep\n \n I'm that kid on every playground\n Who's always chosen last\n A single teenage mother\n Tryin' to overcome my past\n You don't have to be my friend\n But is it too much to ask\n \n Don't laugh at me\n Don't call me names\n Don't get your pleasure from my pain\n In God's eyes we're all the same\n Someday we'll all have perfect wings\n Don't laugh at me\n \n \n \n \n I'm the cripple on the corner\n You've passed me on the street\n And I wouldn't be out here beggin'\n If I had enough to eat\n And don't think I don't notice\n That our eyes never meet\n \n I lost my wife and little boy when\n Someone cross that yellow line\n The day we laid them in the ground\n Is the day I lost my mind\n And right now I'm down to holdin'\n This little cardboard sign...so\n \n Don't laugh at me\n Don't call me names\n Don't get your pleasure from my pain\n In God's eyes we're all the same\n Someday we'll all have perfect wings\n Don't laugh at me\n \n I'm fat, I'm thin, I'm short, I'm tall\n I'm deaf, I'm blind, hey, aren't we all\n \n Don't laugh at me\n Don't call me names\n Don't get your pleasure from my pain\n In God's eyes we're all the same\n Someday we'll all have perfect wings\n Don't laugh at me\n \n \n The point was that people who are in unfortunate situations shouldn't be laughed at, not that it doesn't matter and God will make us all better when we die. It's talking about beggars on the street who everyone hates for giving the city a bad reputation, a teenage mother, a man who's lost his wife and kids, a kid who's fat, etc. It's saying we should be tolerant of all people but the reason wasn't because in God's eyes we're all the same, the reason was \n \n I lost my wife and little boy when\n Someone cross that yellow line\n The day we laid them in the ground\n Is the day I lost my mind\n And right now I'm down to holdin'\n This little cardboard sign\n \n It's pointing out that people don't choose to be victims and he decided to add a little bit of his own beliefs in (which is fine, it's his music) about how we're all the same in God's eyes, but that was more of a comforting statement to people like that than a reason we should be tolerant.",

When it came time to actually form a government you'll notice they didn't put anything about religion in the Constitution (the basis for our laws) and added an ammendment (1st) to give us the freedom of religion and stop the governmeent from admiting one religion is right.\n\n \n Actually, the goal of the US C' was to United the thirteen colonies who were 98% Christian, but of many denominations.\n \n So the US C' is not really a \"secular\" or Anti-Religious document, but one that was written to gain approval and acceptance by ALL americans and indeed their is a genius to it, and written by Christians. John Adams, Alexander Hamilton and Madison to a name a few. Were their five?\n \n Oh, and note the phrase, \"With the Blessings of Liberty......\"",
