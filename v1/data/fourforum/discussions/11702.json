Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., the other front-runner in the Democratic presidential race, also shifted to the left last year. She ranked as the 16th-most-liberal senator in the 2007 ratings, a computer-assisted analysis that used 99 key Senate votes, selected by NJ reporters and editors, to place every senator on a liberal-to-conservative scale in each of three issue categories. In 2006, Clinton was the 32nd-most-liberal senator. \n \n In their yearlong race for the Democratic presidential nomination, Obama and Clinton have had strikingly similar voting records. Of the 267 measures on which both senators cast votes in 2007, the two differed on only 10. \"The policy differences between Clinton and Obama are so slight they are almost nonexistent to the average voter,\" said Richard Lau, a Rutgers University political scientist.",

   "Kronus, the terms \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" are quite fluid. I'm going to steal definitions, giving attribution, and indicate why I disagree with those definitions.\n \n From:\n http://www.studentnewsdaily.com/other/conservative-vs-liberal-beliefs/\n \n \nCONSERVATIVES - believe in personal responsibility, limited government, free markets, individual liberty, traditional American values and a strong national defense. Believe the role of government should be to provide people the freedom necessary to pursue their own goals. \n \n Conservative policies generally emphasize empowerment of the individual to solve problems.\n\n No. Liberals also believe in personal responsibility, fiscal responsibility. Liberals also believe in individual liberty, often more than conservatives do. The American Bill of Rights is largely a liberal creation.\n \n Liberals believe that there should be enough government -- we the people are the government, the government is for our benefit, we are also the governed by our common agreement. Liberals believe that there should be enough government to stand as guarantor to our Bill of Rights, to see that our American principles of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness are guaranteed to each one of us. Liberal values ARE the traditional American values.\n \n As far as markets go, liberals believe in fair markets as opposed to so-called \"free-markets,\" which can mean market thuggery and unchecked manipulation of markets by a few who seek to capitalize on their contrived manipulation to the disadvantage of others.\n \n Liberals also value a strong national defense in order to preserve our traditional liberal American values. Liberals believe that our national defense should be, as much as possible, a shared responsibility. If a person, for personal and religious reasons, cannot bear arms or serve in warfare, that person can contribute service to the nation in other ways.\n \n Those who serve in the defense of our nation should be valued citizens who, if wounded or otherwise harmed by their participation in our nations's defense, deserve the support and care of other citizens until they have regained as much of their individual abilities as possible. No Walter Reed scandals for liberals, no shameful mistreatment of returning warriors, no refusing to honor those who died in the defense of our nation.\n \n To be continued.",

   "From the site cited above:\n \nLIBERALS - believe in governmental action to achieve equal opportunity and equality for all, and that it is the duty of the State to alleviate social ills and to protect civil liberties and individual and human rights. Believe the role of the government should be to guarantee that no one is in need. Believe that people are basically good. \n \n Liberal policies generally emphasize the need for the government to solve people's problems.\n\n No. Equal opportunity and protection for all is assumed by liberals as \"natural right.\" If, however, these natural rights fail to materialize, action by government may be necessary. \n \n The purpose of government is not to \"guarantee\" that no one shall be in need, but if persons in the nation are hungry or don't get the medical need they need, government may need to intervene. I do believe that government should be involved in providing free and public education, largely governed on a local basis.\n \n Liberals do believe that people are basically good if they are allowed to flourish in a decent environment. \n \n Liberals DO NOT believe that government serves to \"solve\" the problems of the people. If the people are unable to solve their own problems -- and if they are empowered as participants in the true, the liberal American dream, they can generally solve their own problems. It may be necessary for governmental intervention in a very few cases. Not everyone can solve their own problems.\n \n Also, this may be a very important difference between conservatives and liberals, depending upon your definition.\n \n Liberals do not believe that corporations are persons, that corporations are not covered under our nation's Bill of Rights, that there should not be \"corporate welfare\" as opposed to people welfare, corporate welfare seems to be quite beloved by conservatives.",

   "Kronus, the concept of liberalism or conservativism is an idea, not something that can be carved in stone. My idea of what a liberal or conservative is may not be the same tomorrow as it is today. Subtle shadings may be added.\n \n In fact, I tossed the two concepts out on a different site and gained a more nuanced understanding of the terms.\n \n For example:\n \n Conservatives are categorized as selfish. Conservatives don't like change. They don't like risk, at least not with their own assets.\n \n I tend to agree with those assessments.\n \n Liberals, in the modern sense, tend to have more faith in the government's ability to have a beneficial impact on people's lives. I agree.\n \n Reference was made to the works of George Lakoff, I think I might summarize his stance as portraying conservatives as requiring a strong authority figure to refer to, a commanding, powerful father figure, stern, adamant in enforcing the rules which he has lain down, stressing obedience to the father, humans are regarded as weak and sinful, requiring rigid boundaries to keep them from straying. The strict father model. I largely agree with that assessment of conservatism.\n \n Liberals are portrayed as nurturing mother figures who encourage individuals to develop their own moral bounds, recognizing that individuals may have differing values, almost all of which are relatively valid. Nurturing. Being able to take care of oneself, enabling one thereby to take care of others if necessary, desiring that people be happy, desiring fairness, acknowledging the capacity for moral growth, as well as encouraging such growth. \n \n I've stolen these concepts from:\n http://www.wwcd.org/issues/Lakoff.html\n \n One last word, conservatives tend to not be able to think for themselves. They need someone else to tell them what to do. Liberals are encouraged to figure things out, because when liberals apply themselves and figure things out, they get new and wonderful ideas, new ways of solving problems.",
