   "J. C. Watts - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \n \nJ. C. Watts, Jr. (born November 18, 1957) is an American conservative Republican politician, CNN political contributor, former Representative from Oklahoma in the U.S. Congress, and former professional Canadian football player and much celebrated quarterback for the University of Oklahoma from 1977 to 1981. To date, Watts is the last African American Republican to serve in Congress.\n \n Contents [hide]\n 1 Early life and sports career \n 2 Religious work \n 3 Political career \n 4 Post-Congressional career \n 5 Name \n 6 See also \n 7 Electoral history \n 8 References \n 9 External links \n \n \n \n [edit] Early life and sports career\n After graduating from high school in 1976, Watts was recruited by and attended college at the University of Oklahoma. Chosen to play the quarterback position, Watts led the OU Sooners college football team to consecutive Big Eight Conference titles and Orange Bowl championships under the leadership of head coach Barry Switzer. Twice, in 1980 and 1981, Watts quarterbacked the Sooners to Orange Bowl victories over the Florida State Seminoles and knocked the Seminoles out of contention for the national championship. He earned MVP honors in both games. He graduated in 1981 with a BA degree in journalism.\n \n \n Between 1981 and 1986, Watts played professional football in the Canadian Football League for the Ottawa Rough Riders, receiving the Grey Cup Most Valuable Player award during his rookie season in a Grey Cup loss to Warren Moon and the Edmonton Eskimos. Watts continued to play the quarterback position (which had brought him success at OU). By the end of his football career, Watts had played against such quarterbacks as Damon Allen, Warren Moon, Matt Dunigan, Tom Clements, Condredge Holloway, Dieter Brock, Joe Paopao, Danny Barrett, and Vince Ferragamo during his sojourn in the CFL.\n\n \n =snip=",
