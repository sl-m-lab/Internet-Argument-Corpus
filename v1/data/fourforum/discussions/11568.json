   "Now that the individual/collective right's issue has been laid to rest once and for all by the Supreme Court, the battle is on to determine what gun laws qualify as \"reasonable restrictions\" and should remain, and which should be repealed, buried and never visited again.\n \n This is a list of the gun laws I consider unreasonable and severely lacking in common sense.\n \n \"Assault weapons\" Ban\n This law is an absolutely unreasonable restriction on our Second Amendment rights and has no place in America, it should be eliminated on federal, state and local levels.\n \n In the words of the Supreme Court:\n \"Some have made the argument, bordering on the frivolous, that only those arms in existence in the 18th century are protected by the Second Amendment. We do not interpret constitutional rights that way. Just as the First Amendment protects modern forms of communications, e.g., Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 849 (1997), and the Fourth Amendment applies to modern forms of search, e.g., Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27, 35&#8211;36 (2001), the Second Amendment extends, prima\n facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding.\"\n \n While not an all-out endorsement, the ruling specifically states that what qualifies as bearable arms covers just about every type of firearm in existence. The Supreme Court goes on to state further:\n \n \"The handgun ban amounts to a prohibition of an entire class of &#8220;arms&#8221; that is overwhelmingly chosen by American society for that lawful purpose. The prohibition extends, moreover, to the home, where the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute.\"\n \n The AR-15, AK-47 and other similar weapons are becoming very popular in America, and every four years they become even more popular with the fear that they might be banned. Basically the anti-gunners, with their fear and hatred of all weapons, have made the ones they hate the most very popular and thus made the AWB unconstitutional, because they ban an entire class of firearms that're overwhelmingly chosen by American society for lawful purposes.\n \n There's absolutely no way a ban on \"assault weapons\" can be called reasonable, as there's nothing reasonable about saying \"You can own this type of gun, but you can't own this other type of gun because it looks different\".\n \n Gun Free School Zones Act\n There's nothing reasonable about this law, this law has even made it possible for the worst school massacres of the 20th and 21st centuries to take place, by ensuring all the victims couldn't shoot back.\n \n Why is this law unreasonable? Because of the 1,000 foot proximity limitation it sets up. If you're 999 feet away from a school you're committing a felony, yet at 1,000 feet away from a school you're somehow not doing anything wrong. How is this reasonable? The difference in obeying the law and breaking the law is exactly one foot, and there are no defined borders so you know where you can and can't go. This whole thing amounts to entrapment.\n \n DC's ban on semi-autos\n Absolutely unreasonable, because as the Supreme Court has said:\n \"Some have made the argument, bordering on the frivolous, that only those arms in existence in the 18th century are protected by the Second Amendment. We do not interpret constitutional rights that way. Just as the First Amendment protects modern forms of communications, e.g., Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 849 (1997), and the Fourth Amendment applies to modern forms of search, e.g., Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27, 35&#8211;36 (2001), the Second Amendment extends, prima\n facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding.\"\n \n and\n \n \"The handgun ban amounts to a prohibition of an entire class of &#8220;arms&#8221; that is overwhelmingly chosen by American society for that lawful purpose. The prohibition extends, moreover, to the home, where the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute.\"\n \n The revolver design dates back to the 18th century, possibly even further, and the Supreme Court has said that the definition of allowable arms can't be limited to 18th century technology, so obviously DC is violating the law again.\n \n DC's ban on semi-auto handguns by classifying them as machineguns is unreasonable because nowhere else in the United States, not even on the federal level, will you find such a definition. DC's home rule is held in check by the fact that whatever they do has to be in line with the Constitution, and this ban of modern technology isn't such.\n \n Lost or Stolen Firearms Act\n This law is completely unreasonable, because it punishes a person who had their gun either lost or stolen, and who doesn't report it within a certain amount of time. Their failure to report when they \"should have known\" of the loss, under the law, redirects police resources from investigating the theft to investigating the crime victim and treating them as an accomplice in the theft. There's nothing reasonable about coming home from a week long business trip only to discover police there waiting for you because your gun was used by a criminal who stole it while you were away.\n \n \n More to follow.",

So you're making the argument that the increased risk due to the increased presence of guns is balanced by the ability of people to respond to said violent occurences?\n\n \n Let me see if I can lay out what I'm saying in a concise manner.\n \n The system in place currently is providing no safeguards, it's only creating lambs for the slaughter. Setting up a special zone around the school that's declared \"guns not permitted\" by law isn't going to stop those that're intent on causing harm, it's only going to inhibit the victims from protecting themselves.\n \n The argument that the opportunity for legal carry will encourage violence is quite stupid. If someone is likely to bring a gun onto a school campus and use it to commit harm to others, they're going to do it regardless of what the law says.\n \n The argument \"if a student gets upset and has a gun at school then they could easily start killing people\" is also stupid, because if somebody is that emotionally unstable then they could just as easily break the law and have a gun at school with them even though it's illegal.\n \n As it stands now, there's absolutely nothing in place to keep somebody from bringing a gun to any school campus and going on a killing spree completely without fear of encountering resistance. Therefore this law does nothing to save the lives of anybody except the killer, the one who should be looking down the business end of a gun, not the other way around.\n \n If concealed carry on campus was legal, teachers would be able to do more to protect their students than simply using their body weight to hold the doors to the classroom shut, and likely get shot in the process, as was the case at Virginia Tech.\n \n Would schools no longer being gun prohibition zones serve as a deterrence to these deranged killers? Maybe, maybe not. These individuals tend to kill themselves by the time the police eventually do arrive, so it's hard to say how you can deter somebody that's not afraid to die. But what it would do is ensure that the opportunity and ability to neutralize the threat in an effective manner is immediately available and can be deployed in a matter of seconds rather than a matter of minutes.\n \n Let's face facts here. When help is eight minutes away (average response time for police, once they've been dispatched) and somebody intent on hurting or killing you is in the same building and knows the layout, help isn't gonna get there until after you're dead.

At least I know I'm doing something right in this debate.\n\n \n It's nice to actually have a discussion....\n \n \nThe way I see it, if somebody is likely to \"flip\" and start shooting up the place, what's to prevent them from coming to school with a gun regardless of what the law says?\n\n \n I'm talking about someone 'flipping' at school. I agree that if someone goes off the deep end outside school there seems to be little to stop them.

My brain is interpreting it as \"Somebody might find out who's carrying a gun if they're not careful enough\", but since I don't know if that's the proper meaning then I won't address it.\n\n \n What I meant can be best explained in a scenario:\n \n When guns are not allowed on campus:\n \n Person X goes off the deep end and decides to shoot up his school. He obtains a gun and heads towards school. He's planning on getting inside before he starts shooting, but a teacher spots a strange shape in his coat and stops him.

He's planning on getting inside before he starts shooting, but a teacher spots a strange shape in his coat and ignores it due it being just another CCW. Person X goes inside and starts shooting. Many lives are lost before he's taken out.\n \n \nAs for the second sentence, the way you tell the nut from the legal carrier in such a situation is that the nut will be the one shooting people at random, walking around like they own the whole damn place. At least that's my take on it. In some cases like Columbine, the nut is the one with the sawed off shotgun and IEDs.\n\n \n I'd say that by the time it gets to that stage, it's too late. It also seems to assume an inevitability of these school massacres. \n \n \nTrue. But at least the opportunity for saving the lives of others is there.\n\n \n Again, if you assume these things are going to happen, then that makes sense.\n \n \nCompared to the other options it seems to make the most sense. I've considered the ideas of more secure locking doors, security cameras, metal detectors, increased counseling, more campus police, etc. and none of them have any practical effectiveness once the killer is actually inside the building with the students. \n\n \n What's wrong with armed 'officers' on campus to defend the school.

   "It's nice to actually have a discussion....\n\n \n It's fun taking pot shots at people like Brady and Galileo, but then again it's so easy to do, could almost be considered unsportsmanlike conduct.\n \n \nI'm talking about someone 'flipping' at school. I agree that if someone goes off the deep end outside school there seems to be little to stop them. If they are in school however, surely the presence of these weapons raises the chance of a columbine style incident.\n\n \n I don't know about that. In the Columbine incident the two killers brought their weapons to the school with the intention of using them. They didn't just snap and decide to start killing other students, they planned it all out in advance, ahead of schedule. So even though there was no presence of weapons available on school grounds, it still happened.\n \n \nI have. Psychotic breakdown can affect people with no previous indicators. See that bloke that shot his wife, daughter and all thier animals before burning the house down. He was at a party two hours before happy and jovial. It's all to do with the stress levels.\n\n \n No indicators whatsoever? This guy went from red light to green light just like that? No previous history of being under any kind of stress, no history of any mental illness or defectiveness at all?\n \n I took psychology for several semesters, none of the courses ever covered such an event. They talked about all kinds of aggressions and forms of stress, the best remembered is the comparison with a pressure cooker where a constant buildup of pressure results in a violent release. But I never read of somebody just switching from normal to psycho without any kind of indicators or vulnerability to such actions.\n \n I know that even the most well-adjusted individuals can do things they wouldn't normally do when exposed to great amounts of stress over a very short period of time, such as the survivors of Hurricane Katrina for example, but I've never heard of somebody just going off without some kind of indicator being present.\n \n \nWhat I meant can be best explained in a scenario:\n \n When guns are not allowed on campus:\n \n Person X goes off the deep end and decides to shoot up his school. He obtains a gun and heads towards school. He's planning on getting inside before he starts shooting, but a teacher spots a strange shape in his coat and stops him. Many lives are saved.\n \n However if guns are allowed:\n \n Person X goes off the deep end and decides to shoot up his school. He obtains a gun and heads towards school. He's planning on getting inside before he starts shooting, but a teacher spots a strange shape in his coat and ignores it due it being just another CCW. Person X goes inside and starts shooting. Many lives are lost before he's taken out.\n\n \n Interesting theory, but it falls short of validity on several points. In the first scenario if the teacher spots something being under the person's coat there's no guarantee that many lives could be saved since the individual with the gun is already in the school. For all we know he could make the teacher who outed him the first to die, before taking as many victims of opportunity as possible now that the alert has been sounded.\n \n Second, there's no way of simply assuming that a person is anymore likely to start killing just because he has access to a firearm. If the situation happened as you describe it, the person would be outside of the school when they went off and thus would have access to a firearm somewhere, and have the opportunity to take it to their school. The presence of concealed carry wouldn't seem to suggest anymore likelihood of such an incident happening the way you describe it.\n \n Third, I don't see a teacher simply disregarding a scene such as somebody having a bulge under their coat, concealed carry or not. For something to make a bulge under a coat the individual would have to be carrying something quite bulky. The key idea of concealed carry is the part about being concealed. Texas, for example, has strict laws regarding the concealed part of the law, and even printing (the rough outline of the gun pressing through the cloth) is an illegal offense that could get you arrested.\n \n In this school environment of zero tolerance and paranoia, expelling students for having a cafeteria regulation plastic knife outside of the cafeteria, I highly doubt any trained teacher is just going to let a bulging coat go uninvestigated. \n \n \nI'd say that by the time it gets to that stage, it's too late. It also seems to assume an inevitability of these school massacres.\n \n \n Well if another massacre wasn't inevitable, or even possible, there would be no need for schools to be considering increased security measures.\n \n \nAgain, if you assume these things are going to happen, then that makes sense.\n\n \n Assume for the worst, hope for the best. Don't believe that nothing can go wrong, because then it usually will and you'll be caught with your pants down.\n \n \nWhat's wrong with armed 'officers' on campus to defend the school. Why doesn't that work?\n\n \n Well on the one hand some schools insist that their guards don't need guns to maintain the peace, I say that's a stupid idea. The point of having guards is to keep people or items safe, and a bunch of unarmed guards against a killer with a gun is just retarded.\n \n On the other hand, if the killer is a student and has the opportunity, they could easily work at memorizing the daily routine of the security guards and strike when a window of opportunity arises. Or if you've got one of those large multi-acre campus grounds, the killer could call and make a false report of seeing something suspicious on the far side of the campus and all the guards would be deployed to that area to investigate, and all the killer would have to do then is just waltz right in, knowing that it'll be a while before anybody is wise to the truth.\n \n Then there's also the problem with the school maybe having only enough money to hire a handful of guards, while having a very large area for them to guard. Anymore it's the norm for schools to have hundreds to thousands of students and tens to hundreds of rooms. It's simply asking the impossible of a few guards to protect everybody. Even if the school could afford one or two guards for every classroom, if the killer were a student he'd know about their presence and could just target them first and take them out.",

   "What's the good Samaritan law?\n\n \n The only example of the GSL I can find is a sort of legal defense that protects someone from civil liability if they some sort of damage while attempting to rescue an individual from immediate and/or likely danger or harm.\n \n \nThat said, Mega made the point that guns are pretty universal, so it makes some sense to have them onsite. I'd personally go for a gun cabinet (or several) to wich only authorised staff have access. That would allow staff to protect themselves and students, and would prevent the students having access to other peoples firearms in the classroom.\n\n \n I actually considered this idea as having merit, although I went a little further with having such a storage locker on every floor of the school, so if the shooter's on the fifth floor you don't have to go all the way to the basement to get access to them.\n \n However it wasn't this cut and dry, and as I thought about it, it grew more complex. Allow me to explain.\n \n First, there's the issue of ensuring that the locker/cabinet(s) are secure enough that they can't be easily broken into and plundered, while still ensuring that they can be opened in a matter of seconds in an emergency. These two necessities conflict with each other and I don't see how they can be implemented in any practical manner. Every safety precaution to make them inaccessible to the wrong party will have the negative affect of slowing down the authorized personnel during a true emergency.\n \n Second, there's the matter of cost. The school is going to have to supply the firearms as well as the storage unit or units, with money from their own budget, which is often cited as being empty or lacking sufficient funds.\n \n The best defensive firearm for when you know there's trouble, in my opinion, is the carbine rifle. It's light, handy, reasonably powerful, and exceptionally accurate. It has the advantage over the shotgun by dealing with single projectiles per shot instead of nine separate that need to be accounted for when firing. Unfortunately the average carbine that fits these requirements, the AR-15, can cost anywhere between $700 and $2,000 each depending on who made it. The Romanian AK-47 can be had for as little as $400 each, but the AK-47 isn't exactly public relations friendly so school officials might be hesitant to adopt it.\n \n There's the option of pistol caliber carbines, basically a short rifle that fires handgun ammunition. Some of these are more affordable, but most of them are just as much, if not more in some cases, than the rifle carbines. They're also limited in effectiveness due to being chambered for handgun ammunition.\n \n The school could go the route of just having security shotguns, but as said before shotguns tend to be inaccurate and it would be very bad to have a rouge pellet go off and hit somebody that wasn't noticed while the other eight pellets hit the target.\n \n The issue is complicated by the need for not just the proper gun, but also the proper ammunition. Quality ammunition that will deform once inside the body and expend most of its energy and pose little risk of overpenetration isn't exactly cheap, we're talking like $20 a box or more.\n \n Even if you have all the proper hardware, you need the software to run it, and that's gonna involve getting the authorized personnel trained in the use of whatever firearms are chosen for protecting the school and the students. This is going to involve training in firearms handling and marksmanship, hostage situation, sweeping the school the same way police would, possibly holding training on the weekends when school is out and possibly running into paying overtime fees to anybody involved, etc.\n \n The more I thought about the idea, the more I realized that it would potentially cost each participating school thousands of dollars, and as I've said before schools have claimed that they don't have the budget for something costing that much. If they're pushed to supply the necessary funding then you run the risk of teachers going on strike because their raise or their paycheck might be slashed to make up the difference.",

   "GazzaElliot: What's the good Samaritan law? \n \n I'd also say that I see a distinct difference between being able to save someone's life, and the ability to end it.\n \n The Good Samaritan laws were originally written to protect off duty doctors and Emits against law suits for providing emergency first aid. The law has been expanded to include anyone with first aid or CPR training. Obvious negligence is not protected.\n The comparison I am making is this; in an emergency, seconds count. The ability to stop the bleeding and stabilize the victim prior to the arrival of first responders can mean the difference between life and death. In our school shooting scenario, the ability to stop additional murders, prior to the arrival of first responders is the difference between life and death. In either case, I highly recommend training and hope you never have to use it.\n \n Chester: Your last 2 sentences is predicated on the flimsy idea that everyone who has a CCP is rational at all times and in all places.\n \n The idea that I can be walking down the street and not know who is packing terrifies me. The days of Dodge and the OK Corral are best relegated to the dustbin of history.\n \n Of course, there are still those in the USA who watch Marion Morrison and Rambo films and think they are documentaries.\n \n True, Not everyone with a CCP is rational at all times and all places. The same is true of police officers, however most CC carriers and police officers are rational.\n \n Sorry to break it to you, but Dodge City is alive and in some parts of our community. As someone who has witnessed a drive by shooting up close and personal let me assure you, it's there. As a law biding citizen living 500 feet from a school, I can not own a gun, but the law allows me to duck and cover.\n \n Yes, it is true that too many people do not even know what a gun is, even if they own one. A gun is a mechanical device specifically designed for high tech rock throwing, it is amoral but holds grave moral consequences for the user. It does not make anyone a super hero nor does it jump off the shelf and start committing crimes. A lot of education needs to be done in this area.",

   "Do you agree that introducing more guns onto campus is a good idea?\n\n \n I do for CCW permit holders, and I want to answer a question you posed earlier to illustrate why I hold this opinion:\n \n &#8220;Have you considered that having a gun on campus creates the opportunity for a violent incident, where one wouldn't be avaliable normally?&#8221; \n \n The answer is yes, I have. But I do not base my opinion on speculative fear, and this is not the first time I have heard this argument.\n \n When we decided allow airline pilots to carry firearms again this same argument was made: &#8220;Have you considered having a gun (on a plane) increases the opportunity for a violent incident, where one wouldn&#8217;t be available normally?&#8221; \n \n We have trusted pilots to carry for five+ years now, and the prophecy of blood spilled in the skies has not been fulfilled. Now the argument can be made that the pilots go through a rigorous training program and this somehow makes them different&#8230;.\n \n Florida was mocked when it decided to revamp its CCW permit law and make it far easier to lawfully carry concealed. Opponents of concealed carry referred to Florida as the &#8220;gunshine state.&#8221; They said we could not trust the citizens to carry firearms, and they made dire predictions of how traffic accidents would now become shootouts. The same argument was proposed here: &#8220;Have you considered having a gun (in someone&#8217;s purse or car) increases the opportunity for a violent incident, where one wouldn&#8217;t be available normally?&#8221; \n \n Florida chose to trust its citizens to carry concealed, and where is the increase in violence from the permit holders?\n \n When my beloved Commonwealth of Virginia decided over a decade ago to relax its CCW permit law and allow more people to carry concealed&#8212;without any training requirement whatsoever&#8212;the same argument was made: &#8220;Have you considered having a gun (in someone&#8217;s pocket/purse/car) increases the opportunity for a violent incident, where one wouldn&#8217;t be available normally?&#8221; \n \n Virginia trusted its citizens to carry concealed, and where is the increase in violence by CCW permit holders?\n \n Now turn to students and faculty/staff members who have CCW permits&#8230;\n \n We trust them to make calculations which help NASA guide a spacecraft to Mars. We trust them to enter and make use of nuclear reactor facilities. We trust them to handle and learn about deadly infectious diseases. We trust them to operate on people in teaching hospitals.\n \n But we can&#8217;t trust them to carry concealed with a permit? \n \n Bear in mind the State that issues them a CCW permit already trusts them to carry concealed when they go grocery shopping at Food Lion, and when they buy a cheeseburger at the local McDonalds. That trust has not been misplaced. \n \n And so the real question becomes: For those who already have a CCW permit, is there any evidence to suggest they suddenly decompensate and become untrustworthy the moment they set foot on campus, only to become rehabilitated and able to safely carry concealed again when they leave and go home to their off campus apartments or to the video store? \n \n Let&#8217;s be honest, here. Isn&#8217;t the real goal a complete ban on CCW permits&#8212;which is based on a belief that no one can be trusted at anytime, anywhere, for any reason to carry concealed? And isn&#8217;t support for a campus ban based upon the logic that a partial, location based ban is better than having no ban at all? \n \n Or do we support concealed carry--just not on campus? Are we arguing that students/faculty/staff members can be trusted to carry concealed while shopping on aisle 7 for ice cream&#8212;but they cannot be trusted to carry concealed while learning about geology or history? \n \n ---\n \n &#8220;Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense?&#8221; Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at 386",

   "Bryan,\n \n Can someone with a Virginia CCW permit carry into a federal or state building? County court?\n\n \n The current state of the law is no one can outside of law enforcement. Here are some of the current restrictions: \n \n For any person, CCW permit holder or not-it is unlawful to carry concealed (but not openly) into businesses that serve on premises alcohol. A violation is a misdemeanor\n \n It is currently unlawful for any person-whether a CCW permit holder or not-to have any dangerous weapon, including but not limited to firearms, whether concealed or not, in a courthouse, a house of worship, and an airport terminal. A violation would be a misdemeanor. \n \n For school property, it is currently a misdemeanor offense to have a dangerous weapon other than a firearm, with exceptions for craftsmen who carry tools of their trade which could be considered dangerous weapons. Possession of a firearm on school property is a felony offense-with several exceptions. A person may have a firearm on school property if authorized by the school to do so as part of an event or exhibit (like the \"mountain man\" who is asked to do a \"show and tell\" bringing his flintlock or percussion rifle) Any person may have an unloaded handgun on school property so long as it is within a closed container and kept within a vehicle. Any person may have a rifle or shotgun on school property so long as it is unloaded and kept in a vehicle-either in a closed container or in a gun rack. Regardless of the weapon, ammunition for it may be kept in the same vehicle. CCW permit holders can also have a loaded firearm with them on school property while they are in their vehicles. \n \n Law enforcement members are also largely exempt from all of these restrictions.",
