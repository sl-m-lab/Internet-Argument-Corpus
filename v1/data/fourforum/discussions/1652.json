   "Anyone see any movies lately? I've been to a few, and every one has been preceded by this trailer, starring a stunt double, set designer, etc, some person on the crew, talking about film piracy. They go on and on about how people who download movies are not stealing from the studios, that they are stealing from them. \n \n They obviously don't realize that people have actually heard about unions. And that every person on the crew belongs to a union, and amongst other things, they are guaranteed union scale pay.\n \n If they want to be accurate, they should have Speilberg up on the screen complaining that he can't buy his new house in the Hamptons.",

   "I don't know how it is misleading to state that downloading a movie without paying for it is just like stealing.\n\n \n If you have ever watched a downloaded movie, you should know that the movie industry is not at risk here. Usually waht you get is not the right movie, and usually it has been recorded in some eastern theatre and has korean subtitles or something similar. The only good movies you ever download are ripped directly from the film in the booth, or from a dvd at home, both methods, btw, are already illegal. \n But that is not the point. It may be stealing, it may not be. \n \n The point is that you are not stealing money from a person who gets paid union scale wages. You are stealing from the distribution companies. Every cent you pay at the box office goes towards the rental of the film reels themselves. (a good movie can run the theatre several thousand a week)",

   "Still in the end everyone involved with the movie is effected by people who download movies off the Internet.\n\n \n \n Please- enlighten me as to how every single person is adversely affected by the relatively small number of movies that are downloaded? The only people that might be affected are those who are promised a specific percentage of the box office gross- and those kinds of contracts are rare. Usually limited to studio execs, producers, and perhaps directors. Most people involved with a movie have a specified salary or union wage- which have all been paid long before the box office starts selling tickets. The set designers, stunt men, caterers, etc...(the people starring in these trailers) have all been paid and have moved on to other projects before the film even goes into post-production. \n \n I think with the downloading that's going on- it should be a really good incentive for movie-makers to turn out a better product. Theres no way I'd pass up the big screen and decide to download a crappy version of The Lord of the Rings on this little 19 inch screen. If they add good extra features to the dvd- people would pay to buy them.",
