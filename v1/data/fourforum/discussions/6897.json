   "Music is more than just an important part of education, it's an important part of being human. People have been making music together since prehistory, it's a socially bonding act that's part of our social nature. Making music makes people feel good.\n \n Besides that, learning an instrument and playing with others teaches kids useful social skills, and teaches them that commitment has rewards, that it is good to challenge yourself. \n \n It also focuses the mind on a complex activity which is good for your concentration, analytical thinking, and the ability to think on your feet, especially, for example, if you're improvising a solo. Encouraging kids to make music gives them confidence to be spontaneous and creative, as well as diligent and hard-working.\n \n One problem is often the way it's taught, and it's often quite expensive to teach kids music in an enjoyable and productive way. If a school has plenty of money they can afford pianos, keyboards and other instruments that the pupils can use, because to really experience music you have to have a chance at doing it yourself. If a school can't afford many (or any) instruments, then its music department is pretty much pointless; not many young teenagers are keen to learn about the life of Mozart, or learn how to write a Bach chorale. There's a world of difference between academic music and performance, and while the former is important it cannot be appreciated without the latter.\n \n It's best if kids are involved at the local level, with many schools and the local authorities co-ordinating with parents to provide a dedicated youth music centre with a wealth of instruments and full-time tutors. I was fortunate enough to live in an area of south London with just such a set-up when I was younger. While the tutors charged for individual lessons, there were several dozen bands, choirs and orchestras that you could join for a small annual membership fee, all of whom put on regular concerts. The trust also recieved money from local government and local businesses. When I left school there were about 5,000 local kids involved in one ensemble or another.\n \n In addition, there were a few ensembles which required a high level of commitment and were pushed harder and put on more ambitious performances than the others, allowing kids to take it more seriously for greater rewards if they commited to putting the effort in. \n \n While it takes a lot of time, effort and co-ordination to set up, it's an incredibly valuable resource for the community because it's good for the kids and it's something for everyone involved in to enjoy and be proud of.",

   "Since the \"crisis of tonality\" at the beginning of the 20th century, the definition of what music is has become ever broader (at least as defined by musicians and composers) to the point where today music is pretty much \"any combination of sound\" in the same way that visual arts encompass everything from the Sistine Chapel ceiling to Damien Hirst's preserved, bisected animals.\n \n I don't fully agree with this, and believe the definition must be qualified by including the phrase \"that has an emotive effect on the listener\". I see this as the primary purpose of art; it is an emotional expression which produces emotional responses in others. This is why art is so subjective, there can exist an artwork which the vast majority of people find pointless and uninteresting, but someone may find something in it which affects them personally.\n \n Of course sometimes it is hard to distinguish between someone having a genuine emotional response and someone just waffling on about a pice of XXXX which they have decided to consider 'art' because it makes them look intellectual. You can often see these people coming, however, by virtue of their propensity to wear scarves in all weathers, berets and beards which they can stroke as they practice their intellectual one-upmanship.\n \n Bringing this back to music, it was only a short period in history (roughly 17th to 19th centuries) when for something to be considered 'music' it must contain all the compositional elements; melody, harmony, rhythm and form. Referring to the example of rap, not only does it have its roots not in Western musical ideologies, it is very much in keeping with the evolution of music during the twentieth century as it focuses on rhythm; the major orchestral composers of the early C20th focused on rhythm as a means to combat the impossibility of being original while remaining within the tonal system evolved by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner among others. \n \n The 'classical' music of these composers' times was the ultimate expression of complex interactions of sets of chords; there was only a finite amount of combinations and orderings. It can be argued that Bach himself had already explored the entire tonal system in his works, and everything written by those who came after him was just an elaboration, with more and more complex decorations as time went on.\n \n This was an entirely Western tradition with its own rules and its own taboos. As time went by the rules were bent more and more out of shape, and the taboos became more and more ignored. Add to this the self-conscious desire of Stravinsky, Schoenberg et al to create new basic premises for compositional strategies, and also add the arrival of other cultural forms into the template of Western music during the C20th, and the advent of electronic music, and you have the multi-faceted musical scene we know today, which is a combination of so many styles and influences reaching back so far in time, incorporating conflicting ideologies and different cultures, that trying to impose classifications of \"music/not music\" seems pointless.",

   "The talent required to compose a good symphonic piece is infinite compared to the talent required to be a shock-jock, jumping around in baggy clothes, chanting and giving the finger to the audience.\n\n \n True, but \"good symphonic pieces\", and the talented artists who wrote them, were few and far between compared to the vast majority of 'classical' music which consisted mostly of two kinds of piece:\n \n 1) Simple dances written for all kinds of social occasion, which could be rattled off in a couple of hours by the most basically trained composer, and which were usually full of plagiarism, even self-plagiarism.\n \n 2) Impressive symphonic works which nevertheless were simply imitations of the current crop of 'masters'.\n \n The same situation exists today; the vast majority of 'artists' are either just churning out XXXX to make money, or copying other popular trends, to make money. However there will always be diamonds in the rough: You cannot deny that Eminem is a talented lyricist, or that groups like Roots and Jurassic 5 are genuinely creative, and trying to push boundaries. \n \n Most rap IS XXXX, but so is most music, from the brainless dance music we see in the charts, to unimaginative generic rock, to the sensationalist \"gangsta\" rap which promotes violence and degrades women. All this music has one thing in common; it appeals to the lowest common denominator and is all about making money.\n \n Those who buck trends and try to be original are often not noticed while they are being most prolific; it is only later when it becomes obvious that they have surreptitiously influenced the next generation of music that they are hailed as the creative artists they were. \n \n As for the amount of sheer intellectual/creative talent involved, this is hard to define. 'Classical' music is unarguably more complex, more intricate, more cerebral than rap, but it is also the most complex, intricate and cerebral music that the human race has ever come up with. There is nothing to compare to pieces like Beethoven's 9th, or Wagner's Ring cycle, because no contemporary music has such complex foundations. But \"talent\" in terms of learned ability to create compex structures is not the same as \"talent\" in terms of pure creativity, which exists in all true artists, who are always in the minority.",

We seem to have come full circle into the modern/minimalist movement. Certainly an aquired taste, and many of it seems destined to rot on shelves in music libraries until some Mendelssohn of the time comes around and brings to it new popularity in the public eye. (The whole Bach/Mendelssohn thing. Thank Mendelssohn next time you hear \"Air on the G String\" at a wedding.)\n African drumming is just so cool. Grab up a CD and see what you think. Maybe lead yourself gently into it by listening to steel drum ensemble.\n \n I used to shun all musical styles except classical, as classical was to me morally, intellectually, and aesthetically superior to anything else out there. While I retain a little bit of that musical snobbism, I discovered that I enjoy all genres. Even though I get made fun of when I put in the latest \"Moby\" album. Or Enya. Boy, do I hear it for that! :)\n\n \n I try not to put down any type of music, unless doing so in jest. For example, I'm a believer that when you play twangy country music backwards, your wife reappears and your dog comes back. ;)\n But, I digress. Rap music has its roots in black protest music of the late 60's -early 70's by artists such as Gil Scott Heron and the Last Poets. The lyrics were typically raw but their poetry told stories about life to a bongo drum backbeat. My first encounter with this genre was during my teens. In fact, I still have the first Last Poets album somewhere. I had to hide it because it came with the lyrics printed on it. My parents would have freaked out if they had ever read (or heard) the lyrics.emoticon_wow Needless-to-say, it was listened to discretely. \n http://www.gilscottheron.com/lyrevol.html\n http://www.furious.com/perfect/lastpoets.html\n As rap grew from black protest music, technology was introduced in the form of scratching records. This replaced the drum beat and the exaggerated emphasis of certain words provided a counter beat. I'm not a big fan of rap music, but it's not because I turn my nose up over its musicality.

Without Music, life is dull, creativity dead, and the ideals of many bright people crushed by the turmoil and worries of life. One must pause and just breathe. Just put on your favorite record, whether it be Michale Brecker (God help him as he battles cancer) or Bach, just try to imerse yourself in each and every note played. That everyone is the apex of human understanding, that is the point where one realizes there is soemthing more to life than just 9-5, or that math assignment. There is feeling in the world,a nd an adventure awaits everyone who wishs to seek their own way to understanding and tranquility.",

I remember the funnest teachers (even now in college) were the ones who were open to the students involvement with music (part of or listening to.) My Freshman year of high school, I took World Geography and the teacher had some CD's and let us listen to music of the different contanents. Even Antartica...\n \n By the way, Antartica doesn't have it's own style of music, but if I could place it as something, imagine combining Celtic with 80's love ballads with a little bit to the soundtrack to the movie version of Lost In Space. Maybe throw in some of Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure when they are in the future. Those 4 combined isn't truely what it sounded like but it's how I would describe it.\n \n Over all, my view on music and other forms of art in school is this.
