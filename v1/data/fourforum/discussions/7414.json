   "Dear Readers\n I have had it. I am tired of reading in magazines like the New York Times, the Journal, Reveal, and so on all the trash on President Bush. He is a great man.\n Some things that are said are:\n 1. Bush is bankrupting America\n 2. The government is being lazy.\n 3. The economy sucks.\n 4. The Bush administration is having a vendetta against the Iraqi's and the Afghans. \n 5. The new saying that Bush is the biggest terrorist in the world.\n 6. That America is falling because of Bush.\n I disagree with all of these. Non of those above are true. America is not falling, America is not going bankrupt, America is not getting lazy, and the Economy does NOT suck.\n Bush is a great man.\n He has:\n 1. Gotten rid of a tyrant that oppressed and screwed the lives of Iraqis for decades. Think of it this way, a lot of people died in this war, but look how many future souls you saved from being raped, killed, and tortured by an evil man.\n 2. The economy is great now. \n 3. Bush has gotten closer than any other president to restoring peace between the jews and the palestinians.\n 4. Bush has also removed the taliban from Afghanistan. Now the Afghans are more free than they were. They also have a government that works. You have removed oppressing regimes in both Afghanistan and Iraq. Think of lives you saved.\n Now some are saying that Bush is a terrorist because he wants Iran to not have a weapons program. Some say, \"Well, the man with the largest nuclear arsenal is ###### off because a tiny country is striving for a weapon or so.\"\n Well, Bush is just protecting the world. Iran hates many countries. They go making threats and Bush just wants to protect lives.\n America has a lot going for it. For god sake. We handle international problems every year. Some come out good after a year or more, and some never change. \n I think liberals, democrats, or whoever need to realize that Bush is probably the greatest president since Ronald Reagan. \n Now, also, people are saying that America is falling. No it is not. America is not even close. Americas economy is great, the government is making a hell of a lot of changes. The government is constantly working for freedom around the world. For god sakes. Atleast seventy percent of the world approve of America. Maybe fifty. But, a lot of nations approve of what we do. America is responsible for the fall of a few dictatorships. Like during ww2, we rescued Italy and Germany, and others from either communism or a dictatorship. We ended communism in Vietnam. \n Think about it. If we left Iraq alone, guess what, probably by now, a thousand or more people would be dead because of Saddam. Pretend we did not go to war.\n If we left Saddam alone, he would surely have had weapons, he would have killed thousands of innocent civilians, and he would have one day attacked another country. \n But look, we stepped in there, and saved thousands of innocent lives, we stopped a mad man from possessing wmd, and we stopped a madman from oppressing the life of Iraqi's.\n I say, Hats off to President George Bush.",

   ". . . .1. He is trying to get the nsa wiretap thing taken care of. He is concerned with safety of Americans, so, he is trying to put this into effect.\nSafety of Americans? September 11, 2001 happened on Bush's watch, possibly because he refused to listen to Bill Clinton's warnings about terrorism and Osama bin Laden, because he refused to read security reports, because he was constantly on vacation instead of tending to our nation's business.\n \n2. He has destroyed two countries old regimes that posed a threat to this nations security.\nWhich old regimes? Osama bin Laden still appears to be running around. Saddam Hussein was never a threat, unless you are really stupid and believe crapola like that.\n \n3. He is trying to get the patriot act into effect.\nSo, what's that supposed to accomplish?\n [QUOTE=John Milosevic]\n4. He has made 33 million dollars for education programs.\nHe \"made\"? Did he run the $33 million up in his basement or sell drugs? What about the approximately $9 billion that went missing in Iraq?\n \n5. Made the economy better.\nHuh? Drinking too much Kool-Aid, Milosevic.\n \n6. Restored honor and dignity to presidency.\nHuh? Lying? Spying? Not to mention causing the dying of more than 2,000 young Americans and tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians?\n \n7. Handled himself with enormous courage, dignity, grace, determination, and leadership in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks. He almost held this country together during those searing days.\nSat still for seven minutes looking like an idiot with the childish book My Pet Goat while he tried to figure out what the Hades was going on. Flew around like a chicken with its head cut off until someone told him he'd better get back to DC and look like he was in command. My country held itself together because that's what Americans are like. Furthermore, we had the support of almost all the nations in the world in that moment who united with us in our moment of despair.\n \n8. Introduced the no child left behind act.\nFailed to fund and implement it. Bunch of empty rhetoric.\n \n9. Made it so grades three through eight have to have math and reading tests. . . . \nMade it so that classes are structured to have kids pass tests instead of learning the stuff they ought to be learning.",

   "Dear Readers\n I was just guessing on the whole aprovement thing. I was guessing how many countries support us. That was my estimate cause I can name many nations across the world that supported us or still do support us. Atleast twenty guys. I am researching this, and if I find a logical answer, I will give you the link. \n Oh, and the comments above is a bunch of liberal bull. If you stop and think about the \"No Child Left Behind Act\" you will realize it's worth and need. Also, Bush has been the best president since Ron Reagan. Clinton did nothing worthwile. He had the chance to go and get bin Laden during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, but did not seize the oppertunity.\n Also, Bush did not wage a illegal war. He actually fought a nation that at the time we thought had wmd. But, that was later false. But, I am sure they were working on them. For god sakes, Bush did everything on this war on terror appropriately.\n If you got any debate, please write me, or start a debate with me, cause I have taken Daewoo` advise and research the topics I choose to discuss. Plus, I have been talking with my best friend who is a republican and understands politics better than I. Anyway, I am researching and not coming up with bull**** stories at all right now. \n -John",
