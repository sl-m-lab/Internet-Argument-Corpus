Overgeneralizations never help. (irony intended) There are in fact Republicans fighting to change their party's stance on gays; I assume you've heard of the Log Cabin Republicans? \n \n The thing to remember is that gay rights are a fairly young cause, or at least that they've only very recently started to get good traction. As much as I would like it, I don't really expect everyone to pick up the banner immediately, especially not those who are by nature conservative. I do believe, however, that the more moderate republicans will swing over in due course, as long as they aren't alienated before hand. Call someone your enemy and they will become your enemy, and gay rights have enough real enemies without inventing more. Allow for the possibility of finding common ground and it might just happen, and instead of an enemy you have an ally. But if the \"official\" gay rights line is that all republicans are by definition evil then we've lost half the country right there, and gay rights are doomed.",

My husband is preparing to teach a modern dance class and I'm watching his sillouette across the room as he is preparing the combination... realzing how happy and lucky I am to have found the love of my life. How right this feels and how normal I feel.\n \n But my marriage is not recognized by my home country, based on some pretty arcane relgious beliefs that I do not share. It is ludicrous and unfair (from both sides of the aisle) to say... \"let the states decide who recognizes my marriage.\" Why should my marriage not be recognized by ALL states in the US? Why are we not welcome in my own country? If I married a woman, she could come, immeditely, with me to the states.

   "I just got an email update from our good friends at the Family Research Council (that would be the religious right Republicans). It's about the gay issues forum for the presidential candidates (only the Dems agreed to come). FRC is ticked that the Dems haven't agreed to show up at FRC's own presidential forum. Well, considering that you guys lie all the time about the Dems, and you're so partisan to the Republicans it isn't even funny, why should a single Dem show up? To wit: Note what FRC says in the same paragraph in which they whine about the Dems not agreeing to show to their little party.\n \n If the Democratic contenders believe so strongly in their positions regarding same-sex marriage then why not attend our event and defend those beliefs? \n \n Did you get how FRC implies, quite clearly, that the Dem presidential candidates support gay marriage? \"Defend their beliefs\" before FRC on gay marriage? But they don't support gay marriage (other than Kucinich and Gravel, and sorry but they don't count), so why would the Dem candidates have to \"defend their beliefs\" on gay marriage when their beliefs are in line with the FRC?\n \n Answer: Because the FRC are liars. They want their members to think that the Dems are supporting gay marriage because that will help the Republicans get votes.\n \n \n http://www.americablog.com/",
