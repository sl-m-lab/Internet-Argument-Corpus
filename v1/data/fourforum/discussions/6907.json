   "Tehran, 21 Nov. (AKI) - A close advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati has condemned non-Muslims, saying they \"cannot be called human beings but are animals who roam the earth and engage in corruption.\" Jannati made the controversial remarks on Sunday at a ceremony in north-eastern Iran to commemorate the 'martyrs' of the Revolutionary Guards and the (1980-1988) war against Iraq.\n \n \"If the Islamic Republic of Iran is still standing on its feet, we owe it to our martyrs. If it was not for our martyrs, we would not have these precious young men with vivid Islamist views,\" Jannati was quoted a saying.\n \n The ayatollah heads the powerful Guardian Council, a non-elected body made up of clerics and lawyers, which can veto legislation. As well as being a top aide to Khamenei, he is a mentor of Iran's hardline president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\n \n \n \n \n http://www.adnki.com/index_2Level.php?cat=Politics&loid=8.0.231408514&par=0\n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1349 \n Islamists Way or No Way\n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1336\n 1,400 years of Islamic Imperialism and Colonialism: The Forbidden History \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1321 \n \n Tolerance and Pluralism: Indonesian Muslims call for death for Christians \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1298\n \n Tolerance and Pluralism: Islamic Supremacist Literature sold in OZ Islamic Bookstores \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1292\n \n Islamic Separtists in Australia: That's why we don't believe in democracy \n \n \n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1113\n Comparing the Rhetoric of Jihadism and Nazism\n \n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/713\n Exclusivism and multiculturalism in Islamic society",

   "Some of us are adept at pointing out the patently obvious. Many of us are predictable in our responses.\n \n Religion has been, is and always will be the largest source of divisiveness in existence. There will be wars and rumors of wars. People will die continually in the name of some lord or religion.\n \n People are SICK with religion. If people would follow peaceful paths rather than try to kill the \"infidels\" we'd ALL be happier in the long run...and that's all that counts in life. There's absolutely nothing one can take on that \"journey beyond physical death\". One can leave fond memories of happiness in the surviving family and acqaintences or one can leave nightmares in the minds all those who live longer.\n \n Unfortunately, not all people think as I do that the former is to be admired.\n \n There will come an end to this planet or at least to human life on it...someday. It is truly a travesty that we humans waste our time hating, persecuting and killing each other. But...what the hell? We've been doing it for thousands of years...why should we be expected to change just because the folly becomes obvious?",
