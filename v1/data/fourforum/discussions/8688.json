Both sides want big government, and they both only want big government when it suits them. Republicans claim they're for a smaller government, but then they come up with amendments to the Constitution to ban gay marriage and flag burning. But then there's the Democrats who want to force you to save money and get their version of healthcare, and \"protect\" us by banning guns, contrary to statistics proving that they actually keep you safer.\n \n That's the problem with today's government IMO. Why would Congress cut government or try to cut down on their power? Same with the President. To get voted out you'd have to do something like kill someone (or else have the President kiss you when you're running in Connecticut). The thing is, everyone likes to complain about Congress, but it's always the other guys that are the problem, never the people they vote for. And finally people want things. These things cost money. So to get elected they spend the most money on their state. Is this really a good environment for cutting spending? Everyone wants to cut spending (at least most people) but where do we cut? No one wants to cut stuff in their state. I heard criticisms of Bush cutting defense spending (these are the same people who criticize him for the massive debt). And finally, how do you think these people get elected? Because they're hard-working citizens interested in serving the country? Take a look at the salary for Congress.\n \n So my solution is (drum roll please)... Make serving in the government be volunteer work where you get no pay. I'm not sure how that could work with Congress, but they could easily still let the President have the White House, cooks, etc. without giving him an extra salary. Maybe have the purple house for the Senate and the Yellow House for the House of Representatives. They can get their meals at a cafeteria-style meal place for free along with their rooms. We don't make them spend any of their money, why are we giving them extra money? Then the people would truly be running because they want to serve the country (well power still would be a part of it). Of course I guess that wouldn't really solve it since it would actually encourage more rich people (who wouldn't need the money) to run. Oh well, I was thinking their salaries could be used towards the debt, but there's that one flaw. Oh well, if anyone else has the solution to this problem let me, hell let the whole country, know. :)",

If the government wants to give out reasonable tax breaks, then give out reasonable tax breaks, not tiny breaks here, moderate ones there, and huge ones over there.\n \n\n Again, I ask. Who do you give big tax breaks to? The guy who pays NO taxes or the one that pays TONS of taxes?\n \n\n Fine I'll elaborate. In a perfect world, I'd favor a communist-like system. Everyone helps everyone, and people work for the good of other people as well as themselves.\n However, this is far from a perfect world. The world will never be perfect, human nature would prevent such a system from being successful, and there's probably no good way to implement such a system from the existing infrastructure anyway. So will I ever push for communism? Nope. So I'll stick exactly with what I said earlier: \"I think that's a bit overgeneralized, but it's a decent baseline idea.\" In fact, how did I elaborate on this originally? \"Don't underemphasize the concept of earning.\" (Did Marx say that, too?)\n Big Bear Scot covered this fairly well. I'll just add that if thinking much of my fellow man and striving for the well-being of others makes me a \"Marxist,\" then you can call me a \"Marxist\" all you want, and I'll frown upon anyone bigoted enough not to be a \"Marxist.\" \n\n I'm in favor of helping my fellow man and put my money where my mouth is. My beef is that charity is a personal decision and shouldn't be coersced by Uncle Sam. I applaud Gates and Buffet for their acts of charity, but detest Uncle Sam for extorting the same amount under penalty of incarceration. \n \n\n Uh, if your beef is with debt, you need to see this chart of the national debt and this chart of the national debt compared to GDP.\n \n\n that debt would disappear if Uncle Sam got out of the business of charity tomorrow. \n \n\n FDR, you have to admit, was president during a particularly difficult economical period. Yet he made the U.S. into the only superpower besides the U.S.S.R. He didn't turn the U.S. into an internationally despised entity. Oh, and he kept us from losing our rights to invading forces instead of taking our rights away under the guise of not losing our rights to invading forces...\n\n We should start another thread for me to rip on FDR. Suffice it to say that he's the father of US socialism, so I'm not surprised that he's revered by many big gov't lovers.

(I've always liked that analogy.) Sorry, but to be brief, it's much harder for me to budget an extra $1000 from my $10000 salary for taxes and keep food on the table than it for you to do the same with an extra million from your $35 million salary... (I'm making these numbers up, obviously, but presumably you can see my point, even if you don't entirely agree with it.)\n \n \nWho do you give big tax breaks to? The guy who pays NO taxes or the one that pays TONS of taxes?\n\n False dichotomy and complex question. Obviously, a person paying no taxes cannot receive a tax break. More importantly, though, there are not two classes of taxpayers, those who pay nothing and those who pay \"TONS.\" I pay neither none nor tons.

While I somewhat dislike that the system allows some of my money to benefit people who do next to nothing to justify their receiving my money, this is nowhere near as big a problem as allocating hundreds of billions of dollars to murder foreigners and stuff the pockets of defense contractors who do nothing but sit around scratching their backsides. I'm more for stopping the latter kind of \"charity\" than the former.\n \n \nWe should start another thread for me to rip on FDR.\n\n To be honest, I'm not particularly up on FDR; my main point was that you seemed to have a beef with the debt, and this administration is hands down the worst ever in that regard.\n \n \nAs for the US being an internationally despised entity, read the history of the Smoot-Hawley (or Hawley-Smoot) Tariff and its repercussions from the rest of the world.\n\n First, Hoover -- not FDR -- was President when Smoot-Hawley was passed.

Marxism holds no such altruistic tenets.\n \n\n You know, I partially agree with you here, too, both in the way I think you mean it and in a way I don't think you mean it. (See below.)\n \n Not quite. While I somewhat dislike that the system allows some of my money to benefit people who do next to nothing to justify their receiving my money, this is nowhere near as big a problem as allocating hundreds of billions of dollars to murder foreigners and stuff the pockets of defense contractors who do nothing but sit around scratching their backsides. I'm more for stopping the latter kind of \"charity\" than the former.\n \n\n If Uncle Sam didn't gorge himself collecting money for the former, we wouldn't be able to do the latter. If Uncle Sam was limited in its fiscatory power, it would also be limited in its military power. Government largesse isn't the result of our militay, it's the resault of our politicians buying votes. \n \n\n To be honest, I'm not particularly up on FDR; my main point was that you seemed to have a beef with the debt, and this administration is hands down the worst ever in that regard.\n \n\n Debt didn't mysteriously appear under George Bush, Jr. The majority of our debt is the direct result of US social engineering programs begun by FDR and LBJ. The ability of any president to influence our debt is miniscule unless we address the social engineering legacies of FDR and LBJ. \n \n\n First, Hoover -- not FDR -- was President when Smoot-Hawley was passed. Second, I think that comparing dueling economic practices with the current disdain for American policy and activity is disingenuous at best. And I'm pretty sure you're smart enough to know that, too.\n\n Reread my statement. The discussion was about international disdain for the US. You linked Smoot-Hawley to FDR because the sentences were in the same paragraph. They were separate thoughts. \n And if you think that international opinion of the US isn't also influenced by economic practices, read up on the logging situation between our best friends in Canada and the US or the effect of US steel tariffs in Europe. emoticon_wow",

NAFTA then ruled against the tariff (two Americans and one Canadian on the dispute board), which infuriated current administration, who challenged the ruling. The US International Trade Commission then voted to comply with NAFTA's ruling, just about the time Canada declined participation in current administation's missile defense big time pork project, adding to current administration's egotistical dilemma. \n \n Not only did US administration look like childish fools, they were fully prepared to put tariff revenue into the general fund and pass the increased cost of imported lumber on to the US housing market. Pretty sleazy no matter how one views it. \n \n Steel? Like lumber, the US no longer produces steel in any quantity due to costs that make even expensive European steel dirt cheap. We produce no tool steel. Once again current administration heeded the cry of inefficient US businesses and declared a tariff on imported steel. They did until Asian and European steel producers presented a list of other desirable products the US imports and announced those prices would be increased to absorb the steel tariff. They were essentially telling the US that if a trade war was desired the import hungry, payment imbalanced US would pay the price. Current administration threatened to challenge that until the WTO ruled in favor of steel producers.\n \n Current US international image is in the gutter on virtually every topic I'm aware of, and by our own hand. To be lead by an administration prepared to enact tariffs in support of inefficient industry and impose those costs on the general public while pocketing tariff revenue makes me sick. If current administration is considered conservative, we need a liberal administration to bail us out of their spending binges and debt accumulation.",

No. But the fact remains, and so does the issue.)\n \n \nThe graphs show the increase in national debt, right? The majority of that increase is in \"untouchable legacy programs\". As people live longer, SS costs go up. As more people retire, SS costs go up. As cost of living adjustments go up, SS costs go up. As more and more people are placed under the SS umbrella, SS costs go up. \n Retirees now are receiving way more in benefits than their pidly contributions could possibly cover due to COLAS, longer life spans, increased benefits, etc.,\n\n So Clinton performed the impossible by stopping the increase of the debt by the time he left office? Or is it that people instantaneously started living longer when Bush took office?\n I'm also interested in seeing your reply to georged.\n \n \nOh, I don't know. The international community didn't particularly like Reagan either. I see that as a plus, personally. emoticon_xgood \n\n Foreigners hated us under Reagan as much as now? Riiight... Oh, but wait, you think eliciting foreign hate is good...\n \n \nYou're entitled to your opinion. ....but you know what they say about them. ;) \n\n In other words, you now see why there's absolutely no reason I should have to stick to a single claim.

   "I just linked you to it. (You do understand how amendments work, yes?) Note the \"to lay.\" \n\n The 16th Amendment gives them the power to collect taxes. It doesn't give them the power to create social programs. Note Article 1, Section 8 as I posted previously. It enunciates the powers of the Federal gov't and what they can spend money on. :xbanghead \n \n\n I said the vast majority, not only.\n \n\n And again, you would be wrong. The number of \"Joes\" paying capital gains taxes should far exceed the number of wealthy pying it based on the shear numbers in each subgroup. \n \n\n I don't see any reason to make it more unfair when it's not necessary to do so...\n \n\n That reminds me of a joke. A man notices that his paycheck is short $100, so he calls payroll and complains. A short while later, he receives a curt call from the payroll department saying that they checked their records and realized that they overpaid him the previous week by $100. The snotty payroll clerk asked him why he didn't complain then? The man, not missing a beat replied \"One mistake I can overlook.\" :) \n Why did I tell this joke? because your solution to an unfair tax system is to ignore it as long as its favorable to you. \n \n\n It doesn't = Marxism, it equals \"Marxism\" as I defined \"Marxism\" (complete with quotes as a mechanism of distinction, *hint hint*) several posts back...\n \n\n emoticon_confused emoticon_confused emoticon_confused emoticon_confused \n \n\n So he has not made any progress toward solving the problem.

That takes guts in this day and age of whitehead voting blocks used to their socialist programs. emoticon_mad \n \n\n So Clinton performed the impossible by stopping the increase of the debt by the time he left office?

Riiight...

   "\n \n That will have to be done in a separate post after some additional researching of figures. \n \n\n \n Since I have a fairly large number of federal programs bookmarked, I'll make it easy on you. I'm assuming you'll accept White House budget numbers, even though independent analysis of the accounting is far more interesting and damming: \n \n http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2004/pdf/hist.pdf#search='historical%20federal%20social%20spending'\n \n Page two correctly identifies SS as a federal program and the fact it is an off-budget item. It also states that SS constitutes one-fourth of all federal receipts and one-fifth of all federal spending. \n \n That's where our leadership started cooking the books. SS was originally constructed as a trust to receive and disburse invested employee and employer contributions. With proper management and updating it would have fulfilled it's purpose, no federal tax revenue or expenses involved. Republicans and Democrats alike cheered its formation as it would relieve employers of the obligation to provide private pension plans. Until WW2 and wage freezes started benefit bidding to attract workers, but that's a different story. \n \n Notice the clever wording of one-fourth of all federal receipts and one-fifth of federal expenses:\n \n 1. The trust was never federal revenue or expenses. \n \n 2. The difference between larger 'federal receipts' and lesser 'federal expenses' is deemed a 'surplus' by our leadership. Don't ask me how one has a surplus in a public trust as I was subjected a conventional education, obviously useless in government accounting. \n \n 3. The 'surplus' is then booked into the general fund.\n \n 4. US securities are then issued to the trust for the 'surplus'. You and I effectively owe ourselves for the amounts we and our employer(s) have already contributed while the government rolls more whatevers off political contributor defense contractor assembly lines with SS 'surplus'. \n \n 5. The reason SS will eventually become insolvent, last number I heard was 2037, is because you and I and our children would have to redeem those 'surplus' securities to provide cash for SS payments.\n \n Current administration's blather about saving SS was a thinly disguised scheme to pump equity markets using 401 pick a letter sucker programs and relieve the private sector from employer SS contributions. They're currently kicking around a different tactic; directly injecting employee and employer SS contributions into stagnant equity markets. \n \n Thinking that average joes will pay capital gain taxes equivalent to those paid by the wealthy 10% of the US who already shoulder the burden of all personal taxes sounds like a myth fostered by some desperate politician with his/her hand in equity investor firm pockets.",
