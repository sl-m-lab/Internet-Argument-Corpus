   "I came across this while browsing the text of the house health bill - and started doing a bit of digging. \n \n SEC. 1173A. STANDARDIZE ELECTRONIC ADMINISTRATIVE TRANSACTIONS.\n `(3) TIME FOR ADOPTION- Not later than 2 years after the date of implementation of the X12 Version 5010 transaction standards implemented under this part, the Secretary shall adopt standards under this section.\n \n My first impression of this health bill is that it is another smoke screen to hide another, more sinister, agenda that the government isn't making public.\n \n http://www.ncvhs.hhs.gov/070730p4.pdf\n \n Felix Health Technologies Inc.\n \n http://www.himss.org/content/files/vantagepoint/pdf/VantagePoint_200810.pdf\n \n HIMSS - About HIMSS\n \n http://www.dhs.ri.gov/Portals/0/Uploads/Documents/Public/MA%20Provider%20Updates/pu200.pdf\n \n What is EDI? | EDI/XML | TIE Commerce\n 'To take advantage of EDI, business partners (or trading partners) must agree on a standard that will be used for exchanging documents. For example, a business partner might define their Purchase Order as an ANSI X12 850 (EDI Purchase Order), Version 5010. ANSI X12 is the type of EDI, 850 is the EDI business document number, and Version 5010 is the standard edition that the transaction set is based on. EDI Standards are large by nature to give businesses the utmost in flexibility to define the information to be exchanged and most companies only utilize a subset of this information.'\n \n 5010: Transitioning to the New Standards\n Unlike with the previous version, 5010 implementation guides, now known as technical reports, are not free. Each report has a list price of $600, or a package of all nine costs $2,500 through Washington Publishing Company, though members of ASC X12 are eligible for discounts of up to 70%.\n \n \n http://www.nextgenpracticesolutions.com/documents/Solutions%20Vol%206%20No%201%20January-February%202009.pdf\n 'President Obama has been quoted as saying the following when still President-Elect:\n \"&#8230;making sure that we're investing in electronic medical records and other technologies that can drive down health care costs. &#8230;part of an immediate stimulus package to the economy, but they're also down payments on the kind of long-term, sustainable growth that we need.&#8221; 12/07/08\n And the Congress and new Executive Branch have been consistent with these thoughts in their early stages of development. Believing that HIT is a key part of healthcare reform which is a key part of economic reform, the first versions of the Economic Recovery Legislation (stimulus package) include over $20 billion in loans, grants, and incentives to encourage medical providers to adopt automation in their practices. As of this writing, the bill&#8212;which has only been released in the House of Representatives as yet&#8212;is still in its preliminary stages, but this is what we know so far:\n &#8226; Much of the financial support will come in payment incentives once a provider has adopted an automated solution, but grants, loans, and tax incentives for HIT adoption will also be available.'\n \n Ingenix Ingenix.com Homepage - Ingenix.com\n Cuomo had charged Ingenix with posting phony rates in its database, so that a $100 office visit might be reimbursed as a $72 visit, leaving the patient with a bill for the remainder.\n The case started in 2006 when Columbia lecturer Mary Jerome complained she was left with tens of thousands of dollars in bills for ovarian cancer treatment, despite having full insurance.\n Ingenix scandal points to need for database auditors | ZDNet Healthcare | ZDNet.com\n \n An Analysis of Leading Congressional Health Care Bills, 2007-2008: Part I, Insurance Coverage - The Commonwealth Fund\n The Commonwealth Fund commissioned the Lewin Group [1] to estimate the effect of the bills on stakeholder and health system costs and the projected number of people the bills would insure.\n 1] The Lewin Group is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ingenix which in turn is owned by UnitedHealth Group. The Lewin Group maintains editorial independence from its owners and is responsible for the integrity of any data that it produces for the Fund.\n \n I'm still digging but, wanted to put these links out there for others to look over.\n \n It seems to me, while there is much talk of 'saving' money with this health plan, SOMEONE will be making a fortune selling and maintaining the required software...don't you think?\n \n And what will the government do with all this standardized personal information it accumulates on the public???emoticon_angry",
