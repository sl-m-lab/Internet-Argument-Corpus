   "It shouldn't surprise me, typical of the sissified and blackified country we live in today....so many responses to the Imus circus and so little to this case. Three innocent men (who happen to be white) are accused of rape by a woman (who happens to be Black), three lives possibly ruined, a school sports program damaged, etc, and there is barely a whimper. A group of athletes get their feelings hurt and the S*** hits the fan. No apologies from the racists Jackson or Sharpton, only statements that they MUST have done something wrong. I saw something on Fox that absolutley shocked me...out of Knoxville, TN in January I believe...a white couple abducted by five Blacks and raped and tortured for hours before being mutilated and killed. Three Blacks on the panel and all that was said was if they did it ithey should be punished. WHAAAAAAAT? No further comment on an obvioulsy racist crime from ANY of them? If this doesn't scream of outright hypocrisy nothing can. Mark my words, a race war is dangeroulsy close at hand...sissy white folks better get over their guilt and stop giving Blacks excuses for their bad behavior or there will be a blood bath.",

   "Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson are each hypocrits and race-baiters. They will ignore wrongs against whites, Jews and anyone else they come not to like.\n \n Neither one of these self-appointed REVERENDS has earned any recognized divinity degree to justify the REV moniker. They are preachers of hatred and bigotry, bound by their mode of operation to seek 'justice' for contrived grievances against 'their people'.\n \n Al still owes for the court settlements awarded in other false accusations. Al is personaly responsible for inciting riots that took the lives of eleven people just because he protested the legal right of a Jewish building owner to evict a black record shop.\n \n It's a sad day in America when hypocritics such as Al and Jesse remain influential via their disingenuous empathy for blacks. They are riding the backs of there own bretheren and I truly believe they dread the day that peace and equal treatment arrives.\n \n Thank God there are many blacks for whom neither one of them speak.",
