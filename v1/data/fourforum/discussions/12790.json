   "So I've been absent off the board for a few days because I took a trip my first trip to San Fransisco over the weekend with my wonderful boyfriend. I never had seen the Castro or had experienced the city but my boyfriend is a graduate from SFSU. It's funny but I went to the Castro and other parts of the city and I could just feel a tension. Like the Gay Community was indeed awaiting a storm. \n \n I had the privilege of being in San Fransisco on Harvey Milk's 79th birthday as well which I thought significant. The last night before we were to go back, I actually watched the film Milk in Castro Theater. It was almost surreal stepping into the streets wiping my still teared eyes 30 years later and just seeing how much we have come, but yet the tasks appointed to us now.\n \n \n I awoke today hearing the ruling on Prop 8. At first I just kind of stood there. And then slowly it just hit me. This deep feeling of hurt, and pain. Something that I just had never felt before. Because with November when porp 8 was passed I had hope that the Same court that had upheld my right to Marry would still uphold it. \n \n I was sadly Mistaken. So I sit here now contemplating. I went to the Protest in Weho tonight. It was nice to see a few big wigs and such fighting but then again I just felt a subdued mood. It was like we had lost ourselves. The US's as Milk put it. \n \n Last nigt I had gotten into the most heated argument with m father over my sexuality and marriage equality. It was not intentional but had happened. And of course feeling emboldened by being in the Castro and having a fire in me on the return trip from feeling that I had to do something, I did not back down once. In the end I left my father speechless. \n \n He was not aware of Gays having their anuses glued shut in Iraq and being fed laxatives thus killing them in inhumane and unjust ways. he didn't know about Harvey Milk and his martyrdom for Gay Rights. But most important of all he realized for the first time that it affected ME personally.\n \n A Gay person wasn't some distant illusion or a person who just does hair or appears on sitcoms or is the creepy person illustrated by those in the echelons of the right wing bigoted establishments and powers. \n \n The point I'm trying to make here is that we cannot no longer sit idle in the closet. We cannot be complacent or passive when someone spews hate and lies and misinformation. We cannot be passive anymore. We must fight! We have to! Otherwise who else is next? Who else will now have their rights stripped? How many more teens need to die and despair of life before their families and the society realizes that they are the reason these bright poor tortured souls vanish?\n \n How many more Gays need to be murdered in Iraq and other parts of the world? How many more families need to be destroyed by the power of hate and intolerance in this country? How many more people need to have their hearts ripped out before we wake up as a people and do something!?\n \n The time is NOW!!! 40 years ago, Gays were arrested for being in bars. But this time it was different. The police came in and beat the patrons but this tie the mood was different. This time they fought. They clawed, they bit, they gave it there all and said enough! This was the Stonewall Riots which sparked the Gay Rights Movement. \n \n We need more Harvey Milk's. We need the US's to stand up. We need to bust down every closet door, every myth, every lie and we need to go forward and fight for our civil rights. The time has come my Gay and Lesbian brothers and sisters and those who stand for equality and stand for civil rights. It's time that we, the US's rise like an overwhelming tide, and stand for what is right and what is just.\n \n So I write these words with great humility and admiration echoing the call of a great pioneer and leader. My name is Jason Farr and I want to recruit you!\n \n The time has come for the US's to stand once again. And give those around us hope...",

But most important of all he realized for the first time that it affected ME personally.\n \n A Gay person wasn't some distant illusion or a person who just does hair or appears on sitcoms or is the creepy person illustrated by those in the echelons of the right wing bigoted establishments and powers.\n\n I think this is part of the reason why the anti-gay side is losing.\n \n Some people grew up during a time period where they spread false stereo-types about gays, vilifying them with nothing more than urban legends.\n Here's a 1961 public service announcement trying to allege homosexuals as automatically linked to pedophiles.\n YouTube - PDT - \"Boys Beware (1961\")\n \n And these liars still abound. Anti-gay people complained up a storm over Hilton's vicious attacks on Prejeans. And homosexuals typically JOINED THE REFRAIN observing Hilton was out of line.\n But how many people commented on the fact that Prejean's church's web-site REPEATS THE GAY-PEDOPHILE claim, saying the two things are associated???\n \n The false claims and ignorance of the anti-gay prejudice are being challenged.\n And while some people like RamFel refuse to recognize the reality of the situation cause they can't break free of their stereo-type of gays, OTHER people DO recognize the truth.\n \n Gay marriage was legalized in Massachusetts several years ago, and brimstone didn't rain down from the sky.\n While some people could not recognize the significance of that to the false claims of the anti-gay, OTHERS DID recognize the significance of that.\n \n Truth is on our side.\n That's why the anti-gay marriage side has to rely on lying so much. Lying in their Prop 8 ads. Lying about New Hampshire polls that were obviously never done as they claim.\n (And before the inevitable reply, I guess I can acknowledge that another possibility is that these people may be so far delusional that they believe the hateful tripe that they have been fed and thus repeat...)\n \n There are still quite a few people alive today who refuse to realize the truth of the stereo-typing absurdities they have been fed.\n But there are many more who are taking their place, recognizing what gays are REALLY like cause they KNOW a gay person and they know the gay person isn't like the stereo-types they have been fed.\n \n The first California proposition 22 which banned gay marriage was passed 61% to 38%.\n The last California proposition 8 which banned gay marriage was passed 52% to 48%.\n \n They lost almost 10% in 8 years. emoticon_rolleyes\n Let's not forget that.",
