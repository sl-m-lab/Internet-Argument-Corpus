   "Stolen from Salon:\n \n \nReligion is a search for transcendence. But transcendence isn't necessarily sited in an external god, which can be a very unspiritual, unreligious concept. The sages were all extremely concerned with transcendence, with going beyond the self and discovering a realm, a reality, that could not be defined in words. Buddhists talk about Nirvana in very much the same terms as monotheists describe God.\n\n Armstrong discusses this transcendence in her newest book, The Great Transformation.\n \n She has an interesting explication for God:\n \n \nThe experience is the same. The trouble is that we define our God too closely. In my book \"A History of God,\" I pointed out that the most eminent Jewish, Christian and Muslim theologians all said you couldn't think about God as a simple personality, an external being. It was better to say that God did not exist because our notion of existence was far too limited to apply to God. \n\n \n And she has some interesting things to say about Jesus and the Koran:\n \n \nJesus did not spend a great deal of time discoursing about the trinity or original sin or the incarnation, which have preoccupied later Christians. He went around doing good and being compassionate. In the Quran, metaphysical speculation is regarded as self-indulgent guesswork. And it makes people, the Quran says, quarrelsome and stupidly sectarian. You can't prove these things one way or the other, so why quarrel about it? The Daoists said this kind of speculation where people pompously hold forth about their opinions was egotism. And when you're faced with the ineffable and the indescribable, they would say it's belittling to cut it down to size. Sometimes, I think the way monotheists talk about God is unreligious. . . . people very often talk about him [God] as a kind of acquaintance, whom they can second-guess. People will say God loves that, God wills that, and God despises the other. And very often, the opinions of the deity are made to coincide exactly with those of the speaker. . . . the great theologians in Judaism, Christianity and Islam say you begin with the idea of a god who is personal. But God transcends personality as God transcends every other human characteristic, such as gender. If we get stuck there, this is very immature. Very often people hear about God at about the same time as they're learning about Santa Claus. And their ideas about Santa Claus mature and change in time, but their idea of God remains infantile. \n",

   "Armstrong discusses this transcendence in her newest book, The Great Transformation. \n \n And she has some interesting things to say about Jesus and the Koran:\n\n \n I know this thread is bait, but I'll bite this time. I don't have a problem with a lot of that--it doesn't really add much that most Christians don't already know. I do have a problem with this bit of elitist commentary:\n \"Very often people hear about God at about the same time as they're learning about Santa Claus. And their ideas about Santa Claus mature and change in time, but their idea of God remains infantile.\"\n I'd argue that, to some extent, probably every Christian's view of God changes as they grow older and does not remain as they were as a child. Most any view (religious or otherwise) that a person has is going to change somewhat as they mature and grow up. But what Armstrong sees as infantile (mainly because the doctrine is unchanged) is probably that there are some key Christian beliefs that have to be there for it to really be Christianity. Lets say a brick mason teaches his child that bricks are made of clay, and shows him how to lay brick. If he, as he matures, decides that bricks aren't made of clay but of styrofoam (or should be), then he's no longer being a brick mason. He's abandoned a central tenet of brickmasonry. \n \n Where Armstrong fails here is that she doesn't diferentiate defining doctrine from \"infantilism.\" If a person's religious \"maturity\" takes him completely away from the view that God is sovreign or that Christ was the son of God, then it ceases to be Christianity--it goes against the very things that Christ said about Himself based on the scriptures we have. Staying true to those defining tenets isn't necessarily infantilism--it's maintaining a defining tenet of Christianity.\n \n And another thing is that just because someone doesn't change their views doesn't mean they didn't go through the process of questioning it and decide the correct course is to take the view they began with.",

   "About miracles:\n \n \nPeople such as the Buddha thought miracles were rather vulgar -- you know, displays of power and ego. If you look at the healing miracles attributed to Jesus, they generally had some kind of symbolic aspect about healing the soul rather than showing off a supernatural power. Western people think the supernatural is the essence of religion, but that's rather like the idea of an external god. That's a minority view worldwide. I really get so distressed on behalf of Buddhists and Confucians and Hindus to have a few Western philosophers loftily dismissing their religion as not religious because it doesn't conform to Western norms. It seems the height of parochialism.\n \n \n That morality is separate from a belief in God:\n \n \nI don't think you need to believe in an external god to obey the Golden Rule. In the Axial Age, when people started to concentrate too much on what they're transcending to -- that is, God -- and neglected what they're transcending from -- their greed, pompous egotism, cruelty -- then they lost the plot, religiously. That's why God is a difficult religious concept. I think God is often used by religious people to give egotism a sacred seal of divine approval, rather than to take you beyond the ego.\n \n \n The question of my own problem with religion is raised:\n \n \nWell, what do you say to the scientists, especially the Darwinists - Richard Dawkins would be the obvious case--who are quite angry about religion? They say religion is the root of much evil in the world. Wars are fought and fueled by religion. And now that we're in the 21st century, they say it's time that science replace religion. \n \n I don't think it will. In the scientific age, we've seen a massive religious revival everywhere but Europe. And some of these people -- not all, by any means -- seem to be secular fundamentalists. They have as bigoted a view of religion as some religious fundamentalists have of secularism. We have too much dogmatism at the moment. Take Richard Dawkins, for example. He did a couple of religious programs that I was fortunate enough to miss. It was a very, very one-sided view. \n \n \n The interviewer says:\n \n \nWell, he hates religion. \n \n Yeah, this is not what the Buddha would call skillful. If you're consumed by hatred -- Freud was rather the same -- then this is souring your personality and clouding your vision. What you need to do is to look appraisingly and calmly on other traditions. Because when you hate religion, it's also very easy to hate the people who practice it. \n",

   "In regard to violence within Christianity vs. within Islam:\n \nI would say there are more passages in the Bible than the Quran that are dedicated to violence. I think what all religious people ought to do is to look at their own sacred traditions. Not just point a finger at somebody else's, but our own. Christians should look long and hard at the Book of Revelation. And they should look at those passages in the Pentateuch that speak of the destruction of the enemy. They should make a serious study of these. And let's not forget that in its short history, secularism has had some catastrophes. \n\n Secularists are condemned as the monsters of the 20th Century:\n \nCertainly, the major tragedies of the 20th century were committed by secularists -- Stalin, Hitler, Mao. \n \n And Saddam Hussein, a secularist supported by us in the West for 10 years, even when he gassed the Kurds. We supported him because he was a secularist. If people are resistant to secularism in Iraq now, it's because their most recent experience of it was Saddam. So this kind of chauvinism that says secularism is right, religion is all bunk -- this is one-sided and I think basically egotistic. People are saying my opinion is right and everybody else's is wrong. It gets you riled up. It gives you a sense of holy righteousness, where you feel frightfully pleased with yourself when you're sounding off, and you get a glorious buzz about it. But I don't see this as helpful to humanity. And when you suppress religion and try and get rid of it, then it's likely to take unhealthy forms.\n \n Fundamentalism as a response to repressive secularism:\n \n. . . . fundamentalism has developed in every single one of the major traditions as a response to secularism that has been dismissive or even cruel, and has attempted to wipe out religion. And if you try to repress it -- as happened in the Soviet Union -- there's now a huge religious revival in the Soviet Union, and some of it's not very healthy. It's like the suppression of the sexual instinct. If you repress the sexual instinct and try to tamp it down, it's likely to develop all kinds of perverse and twisted forms. And religion's the same. \n\n Faith and belief:\n \nWell, faith is not a matter of believing things. That's again a modern Western notion. It's only been current since the 18th century. Believing things is neither here nor there, despite what some religious people say and what some secularists say. That is a very eccentric religious position, current really only in the Western Christian world. You don't have it much in Judaism, for example. \n \n But it's not surprising that religion has become equated with belief because these are the messages we hear as we grow up, regardless of our faiths. \n \n We hear it from some of them. And I think we've become rather stupid in our scientific age about religion. If you'd presented some of these literalistic readings of the Bible to people in the pre-modern age, they would have found it rather obtuse. They'd have found it incomprehensible that people really believe the first chapter of Genesis is an account of the origins of life.\n \n Discusses how the concept of the Creation in the Book of Genesis should be read:\n \nWell, it's not a literal account because it's put right next door to another account in Chapter 2, which completely contradicts it. Then there are other creation stories in the Bible that show Yahweh like a Middle Eastern god killing a sea monster to create the world. Cosmogony in the ancient world was not an account of the physical origins of life. Cosmogony was usually used therapeutically. When people were sick or in times of vulnerability, they would read a cosmogony in order to get an influx of the divine, to tap into those extraordinary energies that had created something out of nothing.\n \n The afterlife and the ego (and, herein lies a major problem I have with religion):\n \nReligion is supposed to be about the loss of the ego, not about its eternal survival. . . . The religions say you can experience eternity in this life, here and now, by getting those moments of ecstasy where time ceases to be a constraint. And you do it by the exercise of the Golden Rule and by compassion. And just endless speculation about the next world is depriving you of a great experience in this one. \n",

   "Armstrong has an incredibly respectable education in theology and religion. I don't agree with everything she says but I think her credentials as a theologian are impeccable.\n\n \n Armstrong's theology needs a lot of help.\n \n Do not expect any original research or argumentation from Armstrong. The findings of liberal Biblical scholarship and of the likes of the Jesus Seminar are taken as indisputable fact, and the argument progresses from there without skipping a beat. It's all in there to some degree: JEDP, the Jesus Seminar, dating Proverbs to the 3rd century BC without explanation or analysis, much less dealing with of competing views; a false interpretation of Ps. 82 (which happens to match one I refute by the Mormons in The Mormon Defenders), political correctness, and anachronism. In light of that most or all of what Armstrong assumes to be true about the Bible is refuted via links or material on this page, we merely refer readers to Encyclopedia index (see sidebar) and offer our usual Whitman's Sampler of bitter chocolates:\n \n &#61623; It is clear from her introductory words that Armstrong grew up in a religiously strict environment and desired a touchy-feely religion, but is upset because, well, she didn't experience God the way she wanted -- what she got was a holy being; what she wanted was a health tonic. What she got what was the Bible; what she wanted was a Dilbert calendar. \n \n &#61623; And by golly, she found one. Armstrong offers up a full slate of statements like these over many pages: \"These myths were not intended to be taken literally, but were metaphorical attempts to describe a reality that was too complex and elusive to express any other way.\" [5] We want to ask: How does Armstrong know this? How does she know that Exodus or Enuma Elish were \"not intended to be taken literally\"? Has she interviewed any ancient people and asked? Of course not -- it's merely assumed that there was some unknown \"too complex and elusive\" reality that these folks were trying to describe, because otherwise we'd have to deal with the idea that they believed these things were actually true, and that's what leads to political incorrectness. No genre proofs, no interviews, just assumption based on Armstrong's preconceived view of the world, and that she herself would never have written such a thing to be taken literally. At any rate, it is clear that Armstrong also assumes that if you don't agree with this, you're not grown up yet. \n \n &#61623; Recounting the salvation history of the Bible and the atonement, Armstrong complains, \"there must have been an easier and more direct way to redeem mankind.\" [309] If there was, Armstrong does not lay it out; like some recent skeptics we have dealt with, she merely looks at scenario A-1, says, \"God could have done better\" and leaves it at that. At the back of such objections lies a presumption, \"I know better than God and could have done it better\" -- as if any person has the capacity to lay out a perfect alternate history and know there was a \"better way.\" Not even Harry Turtledove claims that kind of genius. It's like the skeptics who say Abraham was a bad choice for God to make -- really? So who do they know who was a better choice? Do they have a list of names from the 18th century BC along with full resumes and character references? Such objections assume to possess omniscience in the service of declaring that omniscience bungled the job. \n \n &#61623; The Trinity is a top subject for Armstrong. Though she knows about the Wisdom literature, she doesn't see the application to the Trinity, which she assumes is the product of Nicaea, along with the divinity of Jesus. The Trinity, she says, \"only makes sense as a mystical or spiritual experience\" , which I suppose would be true of someone who'd rather not do the relevant homework. The Trinity makes sense to me in light of the Wisdom tradition, and I'd say if you want a mystical or spiritual experience of equal quality to what Armstrong proposes, get up and spin yourself in circles until dizzy. But if you want to understand the Trinity, read the relevant literature. \n \n &#61623; Political correctness extends only to certain persons: We are advised that Arius, the defender of the heretical view that Jesus was a created being and not eternal divinity, \"passionately believed\" what he taught, while Athanasius, who taught the eternal divinity of Christ, \"managed to impose his theology\" on others and was an unhappy camper. Armstrong's favoritism is about as subtle as Dan Rather's. Those who \"passionately believe\" what is wrong are just fine, because they have passion and that's what counts. Don't even think of condemning them! \n \n &#61623; We are told that it was only at the end of the 2nd century that Christianity gained any converts intelligent enough to articulate its views . Apparently Armstrong has not read Wayne Meeks' The First Urban Christians showing that Paul had more than the usual expected number of converts from the wealthy/literate Roman upper and middle class. She also doesn't read about the Romans, who she says had not \"inherited the Greek hostility to Jews.\" Tell that to Tacitus, Celsus, and Lucian, and other Romans who referred to the Jews in derogatory terms. Armstrong's sociology is rather dismal for an Oxford teacher. \n \n &#61623; The ancient pagans did not worship idols; the idols were \"a focus that had helped people to concentrate on the transcendental element of human life.\" Yes, I am sure that's what they had in mind when they sacrificed infants and had sex on the altars to explain to Baal that they needed some rain. Try that on your next date's father and mother, teenagers! (Armstrong is only half right anyway: the idols were intended to be focal points for the gods depicted to come down and be present.) \n \n &#61623; (According to Armstrong) Prophets who condemned false religion were doing so because they were full of insecurities, secretly knowing that their own god was as made up as that of others . I hear a genetic fallacy in the room... \n \n &#61623; Using JEDP parsing as a basis (a theory which Armstrong admits has been seriously disputed, but which she uses anyway, because no one has come up with anything better --- this is like saying we should use the garbage bag with only 8 gaping holes because we haven't found any with less!), Armstrong divides up the OT, then argues on the basis that those who wrote one part would not agree with the other parts written by other people (as on the subject of God's anthropomorphism -- apparently it never occurs to Armstrong that close and distant terms of relationship are not mutually exclusive over time). \n \n &#61623; As needed, things like the denunciation of the Pharisees are declared \"inauthentic\" because they are offensive. (Never mind the ancient use of riposte.) \n \n So, what more needs be said? Armstrong offers only another fortress of political correctness in the wasteland of postmodernity. I can see why certain people think her work the cat's meow, but from the looks of it, all she has is more begged questions to offer.\n \n http://www.tektonics.org/af/armstrongk01.html",

Such objections assume to possess omniscience in the service of declaring that omniscience bungled the job. \n \n &#61623; The Trinity is a top subject for Armstrong. Though she knows about the Wisdom literature, she doesn't see the application to the Trinity, which she assumes is the product of Nicaea, along with the divinity of Jesus. The Trinity, she says, \"only makes sense as a mystical or spiritual experience\" , which I suppose would be true of someone who'd rather not do the relevant homework. The Trinity makes sense to me in light of the Wisdom tradition, and I'd say if you want a mystical or spiritual experience of equal quality to what Armstrong proposes, get up and spin yourself in circles until dizzy. But if you want to understand the Trinity, read the relevant literature. \n \n &#61623; Political correctness extends only to certain persons: We are advised that Arius, the defender of the heretical view that Jesus was a created being and not eternal divinity, \"passionately believed\" what he taught, while Athanasius, who taught the eternal divinity of Christ, \"managed to impose his theology\" on others and was an unhappy camper. Armstrong's favoritism is about as subtle as Dan Rather's. Those who \"passionately believe\" what is wrong are just fine, because they have passion and that's what counts. Don't even think of condemning them! \n \n &#61623; We are told that it was only at the end of the 2nd century that Christianity gained any converts intelligent enough to articulate its views . Apparently Armstrong has not read Wayne Meeks' The First Urban Christians showing that Paul had more than the usual expected number of converts from the wealthy/literate Roman upper and middle class. She also doesn't read about the Romans, who she says had not \"inherited the Greek hostility to Jews.\" Tell that to Tacitus, Celsus, and Lucian, and other Romans who referred to the Jews in derogatory terms. Armstrong's sociology is rather dismal for an Oxford teacher. \n \n &#61623; The ancient pagans did not worship idols; the idols were \"a focus that had helped people to concentrate on the transcendental element of human life.\" Yes, I am sure that's what they had in mind when they sacrificed infants and had sex on the altars to explain to Baal that they needed some rain. Try that on your next date's father and mother, teenagers! (Armstrong is only half right anyway: the idols were intended to be focal points for the gods depicted to come down and be present.) \n \n &#61623; (According to Armstrong) Prophets who condemned false religion were doing so because they were full of insecurities, secretly knowing that their own god was as made up as that of others . I hear a genetic fallacy in the room... \n \n &#61623; Using JEDP parsing as a basis (a theory which Armstrong admits has been seriously disputed, but which she uses anyway, because no one has come up with anything better --- this is like saying we should use the garbage bag with only 8 gaping holes because we haven't found any with less!), Armstrong divides up the OT, then argues on the basis that those who wrote one part would not agree with the other parts written by other people (as on the subject of God's anthropomorphism -- apparently it never occurs to Armstrong that close and distant terms of relationship are not mutually exclusive over time). \n \n &#61623; As needed, things like the denunciation of the Pharisees are declared \"inauthentic\" because they are offensive. (Never mind the ancient use of riposte.) \n \n So, what more needs be said? Armstrong offers only another fortress of political correctness in the wasteland of postmodernity. I can see why certain people think her work the cat's meow, but from the looks of it, all she has is more begged questions to offer.\n \n http://www.tektonics.org/af/armstrongk01.html\n\n \n \n Anybody had time to read this that can summarize it for me?",

   "Sure they do--orthodox Jews are just as extremist in some cases as Christian fundamentalists. Pity you spend a LOT less attention on them (as a sect of YOUR religion) as you do condemning fundamentalist Christianity.\n\n \n \n That is because they don't bother me, they are much in a minority, and the only place they have any influence is in Israel. I agree, the ultra-orthodox are as flaky as the Christian fundies. However, they are in a much lower percentage, and do not have the political power as the Christian fundies.\n \n In the U.S., the ultra-orthodox Jews keep mainly to themselves. \n \n The Jews I know from Israel that I have had discussions about the Ultra-orthodox is that they do not take them seriously.",

   "Monster, this outfit, tektonics, looks at stuff from the fixed point of view of the Southern Baptist Church which, as far as I am concerned, often misfires.\n \n However, they do use big words in their mission statement like \"exegetical analysis.\" Here's kinda what exegetical analysis means: \n \nThe meaning of the term \"exegesis\" \n The term \"exegesis\" refers to the process of carefully reading a text. To work toward the exegetical analysis of a given work means to work toward the critical interpretation of that text while taking into account the text's specific means of expressing its ideas. An exegesis identifies an idea in the text and then shows how the text argues for this idea. When showing how a text argues for an idea, exegesis pays special attention to the means that the text uses to develop this idea, e.g., particular usages of terms, imagery, contrasts between metaphoric and literal meanings, etc. Every exegetical analysis must be brought to completion. To complete the exegesis means to formulate the conclusions and major inferences identified in the process of reading the text. \n \n Steps of exegetical analysis (for the purpose of essay writing)\n \n 1. Carefully study the essay question and try to identify one major issue at stake in the question. Then, keeping in mind the issue at stake, identify in the text a) a small number of passages and b) a larger context of reference in that further explains these passages. Try to identify a relationship of necessary interdependence between the nature of the issue at stake and the concrete way in which this issue is treated in the text, e.g., the important terms, the imagery, metaphors and their necessary relationship to the task of expressing exactly this idea. Think of justifications for using the given imagery to express exactly this idea or problem. After having worked out a clear idea of the necessary ways in which the major area finds its expression in the text, select the specific relevant passages that you need in order to substantiate your argument. \n \n 2. Begin writing with the intention of providing the most compelling and succinct proof of your thesis. First begin by formulating your thesis as succinctly as possible. Clearly state the precise formulation of your thesis in two or three sentences. Your conception of the inter-relatedness of the text and the idea behind it, as well as the specific ways that you will prove your argument must already be clearly present at this initial point of the essay. Second, always keep in mind that, above all, it is the idea that you must argue for and defend. You must pay specific attention to the textual imagery and concrete ways of expression, yet all your effort in dealing with the text must be subordinated to the goal of proving the idea, i.e., the concrete argument that you have set out to develop. Do not use examples from the text without having clearly tied them to the point of the argument you seek to make. \n \n 3. Clearly establish the connections and transitions from one line or paragraph of your argument to the next. Make sure that virtually every single sentence you put down contributes toward the clarification and growth of meaning of the argument as you intend to develop it. Clearly state the conclusions that follow from your analysis and the argument that you have developed throughout the paper. At the level of your conclusions, from the viewpoint of the overall conception presented in your essay, you may try to point out contradictions and difficulties that you have discovered lying unresolved in the text. \n\n \n http://philosophy.utoronto.ca/phlwrite/exegesis.html",

   "Tektonics mission statement:\n \nMission Statement\n Tekton Apologetics Ministries is committed to providing scholarly answers to serious questions which are often posed on major and minor elements of the Christian faith. We believe in the importance of sound Christian doctrine which is based on a careful exegetical analysis of scriptures from the Holy Bible. We also believe that it is important to incorporate the findings of various theological and scientific disciplines in order to properly assess the veracity of scriptural evidences, and to carefully evaluate issues which are relevant to the Church as a whole.\n \n http://www.tektonics.org/lp/mission.html\n \n \nWhat church are you affiliated with? Tekton is an independent ministry. I attend a Southern Baptist church but would be comfortable just about anywhere where the Bible was honored as the Word of God.\n \n How about a Statement of Faith? I don't know why I forgot to put one of these up, but let me make it easy. Campus Crusade, the big-time evangelistic organization, has a Statement of Faith here. I agree with it in whole, though I vary on a couple of points from the average Christian today on how they will be fulfilled. Here's how. Take #16: Jesus Christ will come again to the earth - personally, visibly and bodily - to consummate history and the eternal plan of God. I completely agree, though as an orthodox orthodox preterist (like R. C. Sproul is) I don't associate this return of Jesus Christ with all of the usual Left Behind accoutrements. On #15 (\"At physical death the unbeliever enters immediately into eternal, conscious separation from the Lord and awaits the resurrection of his body to everlasting judgment and condemnation.\") I would qualify \"conscious\" with some of the points here about the intermediate state being one in which we won't be as alert or as capable as we are in a body. Other than that, you will find me an independent thinker where the TULIP debate is concerned (I'm closest to Molinism, perhaps, but I can't say for sure). \n \n What are your credentials? I have a Masters' Degree in Library Science. What the runs down to is, I'm an expert at looking things up and answering questions.\n",
