So I am interested in the opinion of others as to whether you believe the sequence of events it describes accurately explains how we, the American People have become servants to this corrupt and elitist banking system? \n \n http://www.wtv-zone.com/Mary/BIGGESTSCAMINHISTORY.HTML",

   "I just wish he would appreciate the value of a professional-looking website. If it were formatted sensibly, with in-place links to back up every claim with facts, it would have a much greater impact. It would look like the work of a scholar rather than the rantings of the guy propping up the bar next to you.\n \n That said, there's nothing inherently wrong with debt. Well-managed debt supplies investment without surrendering ownership and can galvanise whole economies. Anyone with a mortgage is buying into that premise: in return for paying interest on the sum borrowed you get to enjoy the stability and comfort of a home while you're earning the money to actually pay for it, rather than afterwards. In a sense the bank is investing in you, just as you might invest in a company in the expectation that they will ultimately pay you back more than you paid them.",

   "But the larger point that he's making which got my attention immediately, and was most disturbing, was the fact that ORIGINALLY, the Federal Reserve Bank was controlled by the Federal Government for the protection, control of and distribution of the American Peoples money. When a small group of very rich individuals took control of that banking system, they in fact took control of the monetary purse strings of the US Government. Personally speaking, I find that reality very disturbing. Just think that for more than a century now, these few families have been making a few pennies from every single dollar spent by and within the US economy. And we have a trillion dollar economy today. That is what I find most disturbing, that a few individuals hold so much power over the American monetary system.",

   "Yes, the federal reserve is a capitalist institution Jo, that's why Marx calls for its creation as a \"despotic inroad on the rights of property\" to effect a transition towards a communist state.\n \n \nThe proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralize all instruments of production in the hands of the state, i.e., of the proletariat organized as the ruling class; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible.\n \n Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionizing the mode of production.\n \n These measures will, of course, be different in different countries.\n \n Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.\n \n 1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.\n \n 2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.\n \n 3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.\n \n 4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.\n \n 5. Centralization of credit in the banks of the state, by means of a national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly.\n \n 6. Centralization of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the state.\n \n 7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the state; the bringing into cultivation of waste lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.\n \n 8. Equal obligation of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.\n \n 9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.\n \n 10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children's factory labor in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production, etc. \n",
