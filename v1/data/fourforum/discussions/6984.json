   "I found this part interesting...\n \nThe phrase comes from the Irving Berlin song \"God Bless America.\" The song was made famous by singer Kate Smith and since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks has replaced \"Take Me Out To The Ballgame\" as the tune most often sung during the seventh inning stretch of Major League Baseball games.\n\n I have never been to a baseball game since 9/11 where they played \"God Bless America\" (And thank God for that too.) It seems to me that since 9/11, that song has gotten over played 1 too many times. And to make it worse, it was the Celine Deon version that got played all the timeemoticon_cry. If they want to go with an American song title, why don't they use \"God Bless The USA?\" At least it is specific about what country the song is about. In most other countries, if you say \"America,\" that includes Canada at least if not also Mexico. On second thought, why don't they just have a plane license plate and give to show that it is a \"bible belt\" they can give away free fish things for the people to choose to put on their car. (Or some kind of bumper sticker?) It's okay, IMO, to tell others you have a religion. It's something else to shove it down throats. A religious person is not going to get anywhere if they have to try and shove it down other's throats because the religion given isn't the truth in the religion.\n Obviosly, if the \"Land of Dixie\" or whatever represents hatetred, than they've already lost a little bit of their true religiosness anyway.\n If they want to go with song titles, I hate to bring this up because it has also been overplayed, but have they considered \"Sweet Home Alabama?\"",

   "I believe snake handling is an Appalachian thing. Not that it's not practiced anywhere else, but Alabama is certainly not the bed of it.\n \n\n \n ~Derived from the American Holiness movement, snake handling is a religious practice observed by a small group within the Pentecostal church that evolved around the turn of twentieth century (Schwartz 27). This practice dominates in southern Appalachia (mostly, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, and West Virginia). These Christians call themselves \"Signs Followers,\" basing their beliefs and practices on literal interpretations of the King James Bible, especially Mark 16:17-18. The ability to handle serpents is referred to as receiving the Holy Spirit or being \"anointed.\" The worship services are informal and upbeat filled with music and testimonies from various members. Their faith relies solely on the belief that the Holy Ghost will enter the body during this time of worship, allowing them to perform the signs mandated by Mark.~\n \n http://home.wlu.edu/~lubint/Touchstone/SnakeHandling-Peters.htm\n \n 'Mature' true believers talk with their god.",

   "Besides, many state mottos have \"God\" in them. They are constitutional. \n\n \n Says who? You?\n \n Just because something still exists doesn't mean it's constitutional. The Constitution forbid religious tests for office, but IIRC, Texas still requires some people being sworn into office to acknowledge in the ceremony their belief in God. Of course there's the issue of \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance, and \"In God We Trust\" on our currency: just because they still exist doesn't mean they are constitutional.\n \n \nBut arguing about the 1st amendment is gonna lead no where because no one likes looking at history, federalist papers, etc... to get a true meaning of the constitution.\n\n \n And people like you don't like to look at history either. Oh, say Jefferson's statements:\n \n \n\"Believing that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their Legislature should \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\" thus building a wall of separation between Church and State.\"\n -- Thomas Jefferson, to Danbury Baptists, 1802\n \n This was used again by Jefferson in his letter to the Virginia Baptsits, and was several times upheld by the Supreme Court as an accurate description of the Establishment Clause: Reynolds (98 U.S. at 164, 1879); Everson (330 U.S. at 59, 1947); McCollum (333 U.S. at 232, 1948)\n http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/jefframe.htm\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\"Because religious belief, or non-belief, is such an important part of every person's life, freedom of religion affects every individual. State churches that use government power to support themselves and force their views on persons of other faiths undermine all our civil rights. Moreover, state support of the church tends to make the clergy unresponsive to the people and leads to corruption within religion. Erecting the \"wall of separation between church and state,\" therefore, is absolutely essential in a free society.\n \n We have solved ... the great and interesting question whether freedom of religion is compatible with order in government and obedience to the laws. And we have experienced the quiet as well as the comfort which results from leaving every one to profess freely and openly those principles of religion which are the inductions of his own reason and the serious convictions of his own inquiries.\"\n -- Thomas Jefferson, to the Virginia Baptists (1808). \n \n This is his second use of the term \"wall of separation,\" here quoting his own use in the Danbury Baptist letter. This wording was several times upheld by the Supreme Court as an accurate description of the Establishment Clause: Reynolds (98 U.S. at 164, 1879); Everson (330 U.S. at 59, 1947); McCollum (333 U.S. at 232, 1948)\n http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/jefframe.htm\n \n",

   "Oh. but some argue that Jefferson didn't write the Constitution. That's true, but he did write the Declaration of Independence and so does deserve to be called a Founding Father (some wrongly use the term to refer all the way back to the Pilgrims). Jefferson also was involved in running and representing the goverment for years before and decades after the Constitution. Further, Jefferson also authored Virginia's 1786 Act for Establishing Religious Freedom, which served as a basis for the Constitution's method of handling religion. \n \n Then there is the \"father\" of the US Constitution: James Madison. While it is true that Madison was a Christian, he was against legislating religion onto others: not even he would have founded this as a Christian nation. In 1785, while opposing a religious bill, Madison wrote, \"It degrades from the equal rank of Citizens all those whose opinions in Religion do not bend to those of the Legislative authority. Distant as it may be in its present form from the Inquisition, it differs from it only in degree.\" \n \n Finally, in 1797 the President of the United States, John Adams, signed The Treaty of Tripoli which stated, \"... the government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion ...\".",

   "Finally, in 1797 the President of the United States, John Adams, signed The Treaty of Tripoli which stated, \"... the government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion ...\".\n \n \n And? saying you aren't founded on a Christian religion is one thing(by the way this treaty was re-written without that in there a few years later) and the meaning of the first amendment is different. As for Thomas Jefferson, you got it right, he didn't write the 1st amendment and doesn't get to decide its meaning. If we want a true \"wall\" of seperation of church and state we are going to have to get rid of a few more things than just \"In God We Trust\". I think Christmas being a federal holiday is establishing a religion...get rid of that one, what about Thanksgiving!? That one was clearly done on religious ground as seen in Lincolns proclaimation address. So those two holidays are out. Displaying the 10 commandments can't be done...or can it....who knows since the court decided to split that one. As for our court cases...the 1947 case was the first real interpretation of the establishment clause and oddly enough the same time that the whole court system moved to the living constitution. Please tell me you don't want to get into a constitutional debate now though.\n \n \n \nNo law I expect, but that matters little as laws don't define morality.\n \n Surely if you were forced to put \"Allah bless America\" on your licence plate you would object? Or wouldn't you? If not, why not?\n Many laws reflect morality I would say.\n \n If I were forced to put \"allah bless America\" on my licence plate I probably would object and try to get the law changed like the way you are supposed to...voting on it (or electing people to vote on it).

I don't think so.\n \n \n\"Boldly stated for all Americans and the world to see, \"the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion.\" Moreover, this was no declaration uttered by one of the radical Deists such as Thomas Paine or Ethan Allen who regularly attacked Christianity and its leaders. This was a treaty negotiated by an agent of the federal government, presented by the President of the United States to the Senate, which, after due deliberation, had ratified it with a two-thirds vote. ...\n \n Upon close analysis, however, the clause is entirely consistent with the Constitution. Ten years earlier, the delegates to the Constitutional Convention had crafted a secular state, one that established, supported, and defended no religion.\" (The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America, Frank Lambert, Princeton University Press, 2003, p239-240) \n\n \n The Treaty of Tripoli is completely consistent with the First Amendment, and is logically tied back to it to some degree. Knowing about the treaty can help us understand a bit more about the Consitution and its Bill of Rights.\n \n And, as the above quote points out, we should all remember that it was the Senate and the President of the United States that passed the Treaty of Tripoli: it's not an offbeat, minority, or non-governmental view that \"the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion.\"\n \n \nSteeeeve: As for Thomas Jefferson, you got it right, he didn't write the 1st amendment and doesn't get to decide its meaning. \n\n \n Jefferson wrote the Religious Freedom Act for Virginia, which can be viewed as having served as a model for the First Ammendment's handling of religion. Jefferson authored the Act but was out of the country representing the US in France at the time so couldn't personally help get his own legislation passed. So who actually did manage to get it to pass? Only James Madison, the Father of our Constitution. Yes, Madison pushed Jefferson's Religious Freedom Act through: the two Virginians corresponded a lot over the years and they shared a lot views on separation of church and state. After all, obviously, Jefferson and Madison saw eye to eye on the Religious Freedom Act! Which was passed, with Madison's lead, just one or two years prior to the Constitutional Convention! And this chain Virginians working together and sharing views on church-state separation can be taken back another step to George Mason, who had authored the Virginia Bill of Rights, which guaranteed freedom of religion. Jefferson is one of the Founding Fathers, was actively representing the United States before, during, and after the Constitution and Bill of Rights, helped shape the US government, and was among the Virginians who authored and or pushed religious freedom acts through, just prior to the Constitutional Convention.\n \n \nSteeeve: If we want a true \"wall\" of seperation of church and state we are going to have to get rid of a few more things than just \"In God We Trust\". I think Christmas being a federal holiday is establishing a religion...get rid of that one ...\n\n \n Sounds good to me!
