   "In a 75-25 Senate vote, Democrats failed to filibuster the up or down vote on Apellate Judge Samuel A. Alito to the United States Supreme Court to succeed retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. With the full vote scheduled for Tuesday, it looks like Alito will be confirmed. Now if we can only get that sellout Kennedy or Ruth Vader Ginsburg to retire, then the daunting task of reparing the damage of the last 35 or so years will begin. Your thoughts?",

   "I have to say I agree for the most part.\n \n Filabusters should, as the 'gang of 14' says, be used for extraordinary situations. Alito is a qualified judge for the position. He's declared he will judge impartially. \n \n Normally, I don't care for the Democratic senator Robert Byrd's views. But he nailed it when he said . . .\n \"A better understanding of the Court's role would do much to diminish the \"hype\" that now accompanies the judicial nomination process. The role of the Senate in the Alito debate is not to push legislation, or to score points for those who either support or oppose specific legislative proposals. The purpose of the current debate is to evaluate the fitness of Judge Samuel Alito to sit on the highest Court of our land which includes his temperament and his intellectual ability...\n \n I know not exactly what kind of Justice Samuel Alito may actually be - - no one does. But my considered judgment from his record, from his answers to my questions, and from his obvious intelligence and sincerity, leads me to believe him to be an honorable man, who loves his country, loves his Constitution, and will give of his best. Can we really ask for more?\"",

They wouldn't put a pro-life speaker on the list at their conventions, but Republicans had several pro-choice speakers at theirs.",
