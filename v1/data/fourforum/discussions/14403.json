   "Winston - try a geography lesson. Juarez is a MEXICAN city. These women are completely legal.emoticon_cool\n \n Juarez is a vile border town (accross the Rio Grande from El Paso) that I have been to several times. It is steeped in poverty. Nothing good happens there.\n \n I think what is happening to these women is a combination of many things - insecure, violent men in a patriarchal society, the drug issues on the border and I have also heard rumors that they are sometimes killed to sell their organs on the black market.\n \n The maquiladora plants in Mexico are reprehensible - but not responsible for this. They operate unsafely, pay the people near slave labor and comepletely disregard US and Mexican labor laws. They also dump their toxic waste into the border water supply despite the promis of the US government that US owned companies would ship their waste back to the US and dispose of it safely (Reagan actually promised this). The border maquiladora plants also pre-date NAFTA. They are the result of the Border Industrialization Program of 1964. NAFTA has simply opened the rest of Mexico for US companies to abuse. \n \n As a note - not all US plants in Mexico are bad, but some are horrific.",
