   "Fact: For a handgun to qualify for sale in California is has to be listed on the California Handgun Roster, a supposed list of \"safe\" handguns. If a handgun doesn't fit on this list the manufacturer can get a specific model approved on the list if they pay California a yearly fee of $200 per model. If they refuse to pay this fee (which is basically extortion money) the model is removed and it's no longer considered safe.\n \n Springfield Armory makes two specific model handguns, the 1911 and the XD, in 142 different configurations. If they wished for California to allow them to sale of each of these models they would have to pay California $28,400 every single year.\n \n Fact: In the aftermath of \"Dirty Harry\" everybody wanted to buy a Smith & Wesson Model 29 in .44 Magnum. However after buying one and trying it out, they discovered that firing anything more than six rounds was too uncomfortable, and many owners would return the gun to the store, along with a nearly full box of ammunition and buy something more controllable and easier to shoot.\n \n This practice, common even today, is outlawed in states that maintain gun rationing schemes. So if you buy a handgun in California that you later discover you hate to shoot, you're legally required to maintain ownership of the gun for at least 30 days before you can get something you'd like better.",

This makes sense only to someone able to wear a thimble as a steel helmet. What really matters here is the pinheads have been able to slip one over on we the people, so far in CA and DC.\n \n Tell me again the thinking behind the rationing scam. And to think I lived while you could get them through the mail. ",
