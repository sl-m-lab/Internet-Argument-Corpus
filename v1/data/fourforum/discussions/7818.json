   "When I came into work last week, I found an envelope addressed to me on the my keyboard (and a CD laying on my desk). It was written by a Christian who knows I am an atheist. As is typical, she couldn't keep her religion to herself, and she mangled science.\n \n Here are the complete contents of that letter (except that I replace actual names of people and organizations, and some other key information, with things such as [Christian artist] and [our place of work]).\n \n \n ***********************************\n March 9, 2006\n \n Rick, \n \n \n\"For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.\" - Matthew 12:34\n\n \n I wanted to take some time to challenge you. I know you like to debate, but that is not the challenge I am putting forth today. This is a challenge to say, \"What If\" ... you believe.\n \n \n\"Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\" - Hebrews 11:1\n\n \n Something interesting to me is that I've been here for nine months at [our place of work], and you know I believe in God. Yet, you haven't questioned my faith. I believe now I understand. You were trying to figure out why I am so happy. I am here to explain why I feel the need to give you this gift. Before I do, though, I need you to continue to read this, relax, and don't judge this letter. Just believe ...What If ... everything on this page is Truth.\n \n \n\"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.\" - Hebrews 11:3\n\n \n Want to hear an interesting fact? A few months ago I heard a pastor say that when she studied physics, she found out something very interesting. She read an article that stated that mitochondria are not the smallest part of the nuclei of a cell. Scientists found out that the smallest part of the nuclei of a cell is actually ... a sound wave. She said also that she found out that sound and light are 40 octaves apart. In other words, if you speed up sound 40 octaves, it becomes light. And, if you slow down light 40 octaves, it becomes sound. Isn't that interesting? Now take a look at this ...\n \n \n\"In the beginning, God ...\" - Genesis 1:1\n\n \n In the beginning God (yes, HE is real), spoke everything into existence. If you think about it ... everything said above is scientific fact. Since that is fact, then it must be true that every part of our bodies (cells) are made up of sound waves. The fact that God spoke us into existence ... HE spoke \"sound\" and it formed us (humans). Just face it, it's a fact.\n \n \n\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the Light shined in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.\" - John 1:1-5\n\n \n \n\"Once more Jesus addressed the crowd, 'I am the Light of the world. He who follows Me will not be walking in the dark, but will have the Light that is life.'\" - John 8:12\n\n \n Since all of the above is true (fact), then the following Scripture must be true:\n \n \n\"For God so loved the world, that He gave His one and only Son, Jesus, that whosoever believes in Him, should not parish, but have everlasting life.\" - John 3:16\n\n \n Okay, here comes the fun part. What this letter is all about. You probably don't know this, but I've been praying for you for the last 6 months. I've been praying for you and so has my friend and Christian artist, [artist's name]. I am not praying in an intimate manner. I am simply praying that God will break your heart, bring love (Christ's love) into your life, peace that passes all understanding into your mind. I am concerned with your soul. Why? Because you are either going to hell or heaven, and because I am a child of God, it is my duty to share Christ with you at least once while I'm here at [our place of work]. And, so, I picked my last day here to write this letter to you and leave a copy of [Christian artist]'s [CD title] CD with you. We are concerned with what you decide about your future. After this letter, though, it isn't in my hands anymore. According to Scripture, after the \"seed\" of life has been planted into a lost person, the blood is off the prophets hand (yes, I believe in prophecy for today, and I believe in the gift of the prophetic). And, about true PEACE: have you ever wondered why you can't sleep at night? Why you don't have peace? It's because peace, true peace, comes straight from God. And, you don't have God in your life and heart. So, I'll move on ...\n \n \n\"Thus saith the Lord that made thee, and formed thee from the womb.\" - Isaiah 44:2\n\n \n \n\"I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside Me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known Me: that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the Lord and there is none else. I form the Light and create darkness: I make peace and create evil: I the Lord do all things.\" - Isaiah 45:5-7\n\n \n And lastly, I am leaving you with a few Scriptures to think about. When you do finally come to true brokenness before the Father (Christ), then here's what you need to do:\n \n \n\"For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.\" - Romans 3:23\n\n \n \n\"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life.\" - Romans 6:23\n\n \n \n\"For whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.\" \n - Romans 10:13\n\n \n \n\"That if thou shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.\" - Romans 1:9\n\n \n This is another challenge for you: I dare you to speak this song over your life:\n \n \nEverything\n \n Lord, You are the love of my life!\n Lord, You are the hope that I cling to!\n You mean, more than this world to me!\n \n I wouldn't trade you for silver and gold!\n I wouldn't trade you for riches untold!\n You are, You are my everything!\n \n\n \n And in closing, I pray again that this touches the innermost part of your heart and soul. I have given you a copy of [Christian artist]'s CD [CD title]. The only song that I challenge you to listen to, is song number 2. It's entitled \"What If\". She wrote it for people just like you.\n \n \n In Christ,\n \n [Christian co-worker]\n [URL to Christian record site] \n \n \n PS: If you are curious in seeing [Christian artist], she will be in concert in [city, state], on April 14, 2006, at the [city] Civic Center.\n \n Have a great week in the presence of God!\n ***********************************\n \n \n \n \n \n \n NOTES: \n \n 1) The ellipses (...) in the above text were in the original. In this material, they do not represent words or sentences that I omitted from the original: every word of the original has been retained, with the exception of things such as the names of people and the company where we work (which have been replaced with items such as [Christian artist] and [our place of work]).\n \n 2) The writer's dating of the letter as March 9, 2006 is inconsistent with her statement made in it that she was writing on her last day at work. She laid the envelope on my desk at work on March 23, 2006, and I saw her working at our company several days during that same week: but when I tried on talk to her on March 24, I found that she no longer worked here. So her last day was March 23, 2006. Perhaps the 2-week discrepancy has something to do with her giving the standard 2-week notice that she was quitting?! I can't say.\n \n 3) Just for the record, she typed all of the letter except for the PS portion, which was handwritten.\n \n 4) Just for the record, I've setoff the quotes from scripture to more clearly indicate, at a glance, which words are hers and which are from the Bible.\n \n 5) I've highlighted the part where she mangles science.",

Only someone completely ignorant of science - like this Christian and the Christian that relayed the information to her - would unequestioningly swallow such ridiculous crud.\n \n 2) Mitochondria are not found in the nucleus: they are organelles found in the cytosol, as anyone who took even BIO101 would know. Guess the Christian really is completley ignorant of biology, as is the pastor who spewed this crud out to her.\n \n 3) \"nuclei of a cell\" is wrong, essentially.

Simply put, only someone very ignorant of physics - like the Christian who left the letter on my keyboard, and the Christian pastor who spewed out this crud in the first place - would think that you could speed sound up and get light, or slow light down and get sound.\n \n \n \n No it's not a fact at all. Only someone completely ignorant of science - like the Christian lady who left the letter for me, and the Christian pastor who spewed this load of crud out in the first place - could believe that those were scientific facts.\n\n \n I've met an awful lot of unscienced atheists too, who didn't even know what abiogenesis / spontaneous generation is. \n \n So what?",

Atheism extols hypocrisy.\n \n Jean Meslier (1678-1733) was a Roman Catholic priest who served as Vicar of Bue in Champagne, France for thirty years. Voltaire (1694-1778), the French deist who vigorously opposed Christianity and sought to fashion his own naturalistic religion, described Meslier as \"the most singular phenomenon ever seen among all the meteors fatal to the Christian religion.\"\n \n In a recent essay, A.J. Mattill, Jr., a Contributing Editor for The American Rationalist (a small journal published bi-monthly out of St. Louis), gushes over Meslier, applauding him as one of the great champions of skepticism.\n \n As a preliminary matter, we must make two observations.\n \n First, if Meslier was any sort of symbolic luminary at all, he must have been a \"meteor,\" i.e., a phenomenon that provides no significant or lasting illumination, and who appeared as but a \"glitch\" in the galaxy of literary history. The priest was most obscure. I have consulted several sources - from The Encyclopedia Britannica to The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church - and I cannot find a solitary reference to the gentleman - not even an allusion to his name! Apparently he is considered illustrious only by the atheists.\n \n Second, what is this insanity about Meslier's influence being \"fatal\" to the Christian religion? It is not even legitimate hyperbole to suggest that any skeptic has proved \"fatal\" to Christianity - or, for that matter, the whole of them combined. Voltaire himself was not (though he boasted he would be), and he was much more of a significant influence than Meslier.\n \n But consider for a moment this rogue whom skepticism extols so highly. \n \n When Jean Meslier died at the age of 55, three handwritten manuscripts were discovered in his home. Authored and signed by Meslier, these documents were titled, My Testament. The writings contained a series of confessions by the priest - combined with a vicious attack against the Bible. The documents revealed that his entire life had been a sham.\n \n Supposedly, his religious faith was abandoned as an adolescent, but, wishing to obey his father, he pursued the vocation of a priest.\n \n Here is a portion of his confession, directed to the members of his parish, as reported by Mattill (The American Rationalist, June/July, 1999, p. 3).\n \n \n \"I was nevertheless compelled to teach you your religion and to carry out that false duty that I had committed myself to as the vicar of our parish ... I had the displeasure of finding myself annoyingly obliged to act and speak totally against my own feelings, to entertain you with foolish nonsense and vain superstition that I hated, condemned, and disliked in my heart. I, however, declare that I never did it without great pain and extreme repugnance.

I feel hesistant about trying to convince people of my (well supported) views, even though this is quite unnecessary, as the religious people clearly have no problem speaking their minds and trying to force their unsupported religion down others throats.\n \n \nsimone: I may still be coming to Alabama, old Rummy's got his undies in a Frist and everything military is so totally screwed it could even be Anarctica.\n\n \n Yeah, I heard that 5 high-ranking officiles (retired generals?) have recently, in one way or another, called for Rumsfeld's resignation. Finally! \n \n \nsimone: Um, isn't there an Atheist Underground located somewhere in Alabama?\n\n \n Yes, and I am it! emoticon_xangel \n \n But seriously folks...\n \n There is an Alabama chapter of American Atheists, but mostly what it does is just send out e-mails to members.\n \n The websites are misleading. I looked and found one that said there were montly atheist meetings in Enterprise, but when I drove out there and waited an hour and no one showed up, I wrote to the organization and found that they had been cancelled a while back and the web page had not been updated to reflect that fact.\n \n There is a Camp \"something\" somewhere in mid-Alalabama that has montly (IIRC) meetings, but it's too far for me to drive.\n \n From my point of view, I as an atheist am essentially stranded out in no-man's land.\n \n \n \n \n \n Compare atheism to organized religion. Because of something EasyRider or marc9000 wrote in another thread (which I can't find now) about so-called \"organized atheism\", I did a little comparison test.\n \n I left my apartment and drove off in one direction on a single road. Within 3 miles of my apartment - on just one road, in just one direction - there were 7 churches!\n \n 0.1 miles Church of Christ\n 0.6 miles Grace Bible Church\n 1.8 milles Church of Christ\n 1.9 milles Church of the Nazarene\n 2.5 milles Primitive Baptist Church\n 2.8 miles Independent Baptist Church\n 3.0 milles Freewill Baptist Church\n \n Now, do you know how many atheist \"Churches\" (buildings) there were along that same stretch of road? Anyone? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller? 0. None. Zip. Zilch. \n \n In fact, the web page for my city states that there are 125 churches in my little city. But there are 0 atheist buildings.\n \n \n \n But that's not all. Consider the many arena-sized churches we see across the United States. These venues hold 10,000 or more people and are filled each week, showing the highly organized nature of religion. Compare that to atheism: American Atheists advertised for months their \"Atheists in Foxholes\" march in Washington, D.C. No how many showed up? A few hundred (IIRC, just over 200). Months worth of attempts to organize atheists turned up <300 people nationwide: my little city has multiple churches that can bring in that many people each week.\n \n In fact, one church - just 1/4 mile from my work - recently expanded across one city block! They had already taken up a city block but wanted to expand to build a child daycare (so they can get even more money!). What to do? Apparently, the bought the road separating them from a vacant lot - and the vacant lot itself - and then covered over the road and got to building. My rinky dink city has multiple churches larger than the largest atheist building in the entire United States.\n \n Now consider the airwaves. There are at least 2 all-religious national TV stations: WTBN and EWTN (I might have those call letters wrong). Millions of religious people tune in to those channels and the WTBN pastors and preachers can get their message out to people in the millions: and therefore, they can - and do - organize people in droves. Now, how many all-atheist national TV stations are there? 0. \n \n Next compare political influence. There are, or have been, several religious groups that have been highly influential in US politics. One of them (the Moral Majority, IIRC) was largely responsible for getting Ronald Reagan elected President, and Bush's being elected President (well, once - his second win wasn't do to an election) were also largely the result of the organized nature of religion in America. Now, where are the great atheist political parties? None. What recent President has been elected because the atheist organized around him? None.\n \n Now consider what the two can get their followers to do financially. The churches get people to give 10% of their gross income. For a family that makes $50,000 gross per year, their tithe comes to $5,000 ... per year. On the other hand, for a one-time payment of $1,000 a person can become a life-time member in American Atheists. That's only 1/5 of money people will gladly pay to a church, and it's only once, whereas religious people will tithe their entire lives. Atheists just can't organize their members to pay vast amounts of money the way churches can.\n \n And let's not forget about the fact that, not only are churches raking in the big bucks, but they get it tax free too (IIRC: it may just be a huge tax benefit somehow: I'm not an accountant!). And, they also get huge tax breaks on their property. What a racket!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n \n Is atheism organized? Very loosely. Anyone who tries to claim that atheism is organized to the same extent that religion is is off his rocker!",

Second, if the Bible were true, then a Christian could pray for the health of another person recovering from heart surgery and it would work.

   "DamEtel: Sorry, that's wrong. Atheism is based on rationalism and logic: religion is based on blind faith. There's no \"equally\" about it. Did you mean \"similarly\"? \n\n \n \nPhunting: A position of Atheism is a position of faith to an extent. Faith in logic if you will, but an element still exists.\n\n \n Now you're just being silly. The FAITH involved in religion is accurately called FAITH. The \"faith\" involved in atheism is not the same sort of \"faith\" at all. It doesn't take true faith to NOT believe in God - something that cannot be seen, heard, felt, smelled, or tasted, either directly or by means of technology. It DOES take faith to believe in God, because His existence cannot be verified: God can't be seen, touched, smelt, etc.... There's no \"equally\" about it.\n \n \nDamEtel: Also, atheism has a better claim to being the \"obvious truth\" because it better fits what we find in the real world. \n\n \n \nPhunting: Indeed. Yet there was a time when a diest belief best fitted how we humans percieve the world.\n\n \n Yeah, and Deism didn't have talking burning bushes, water turning into wine, virgin births, God becoming human, and so on. There's nothing \"obviously true\" about a virgin giving birth, or a burning bush being able to talk, and so on. Deism WAS a better fit to the natural world than was Christianity, and therefore, between the two, did have a better claim for being \"obvious truth\".\n \n But then Deism itself had internal problems pointed out about it.\n \n Atheism, unlike Christianity and Deism, is completely consistent with the world we find ourselves in, and atheism has no internal inconsistencies. \n \n The major attacks against atheism are not scientific or evidential or anything of the sort: they are mispresentations of atheists as being immoral because of their lack of belief in God. That \"attack\" is bogus, but that's a different matter for a different discussion.\n \n \nPhunting: Therefore I have issue with the fact that it is 'obvious truth' in itself being a valid justification.\n\n \n First, just so we're all straight on this, let's remember that \"obvious truth\" was your term. I didn't introduce it into the discussion, you did.\n \n Second, let's remember that \"obvious truth\" has been being enclosed in quotes, indicating that it does not have its normal meaning. \"Obvious truth\" and obvious truth are different things.\n \n Third, a valid justification ... for what? What are you talking about?\n \n \n \nPhunting: The element of Christianity I have a problem with is the drive for conversion of others.\n\n \n Oh, but Christians have done much more than that that atheists should have a problem with. They've distorted science, they've tried to get their religion taught in public schools as science, they've distorted American history, they've tried to turn our country into a theocracy, they get money from public taxes funneled into their private religious causes, they indoctrinate young children into their cult at an age when the child isn't able to come to his/her own conclusions about he world, they've tried to dehumanize gays, etc.\n \n \nPhunting: I am certain in my atheism; I have no doubt that what I believe is the truth. However I do admit that a) there is an element of faith in that and b) that what I take as the obvious truth is not so to someone else.\n\n \n Uhm, do you have no doubt that what you believe is the truth, or, do you know that there's an element of faith in it? Make up your mind.\n \n \nPhunting: I rightfully do not want Christians or any other religion 'forcing' their beliefs on me. However I have the courtesy to believe the same should be reciprocated. Your statement 'we try to free people's minds from religious enslavement.' appeared to me to be a de facto endorsement of exactly the same attitude you claim to find abhorrent in Christians.\n\n \n That's not what I said.\n \n Nowhere did I say anything about atheists going door to door on Saturday mornings trying to convert people to our view. \n \n Nowhere did I say anything about atheists bugging their coworkers, repeatedly, trying to convert them to our view. \n \n Nowhere did I say anything about atheists trying to force our beliefs to be taught in public-school science classes, so kids will be exposed to it everywhere they go.\n \n Nowhere did I say anything about atheists indoctrinating kids as young as possible to get them to accept our position before they have a chance to come to their own conclusion.\n \n Nowhere did I say that parents ought to take their kids every Sunday to an atheist building to have atheism taught to them.\n \n \n I didn't mention anything about trying to force our position onto others the way Christians do.\n \n In fact, atheists did free my mind from its religious shackles, and not one of those atheists did any of the above to me. They used reasoned arguments and evidences.\n \n \n \n Which brings me to my statement that you misread. Atheists like me \"try to free people's minds from religious enslavement\" by using reason and logic, at discussion forums like this one, for example. Start with this one: God's existence cannot be verified. If I tell you that there's a 3-inch magical pink zebra flying around your room but that you just can't see, hear, touch, smell, or taste it; nor can you by any means measure its mass, volume, velocity, etc.; and there's no other possible way for you to confirm its existence; then is it more rational to believe in its existence or not? Similarly, the most rational position to take on God's existence is that of a lack of belief in God - atheism.\n \n On top of that we point out that the Bible is filled with historically incorrect information, errors, internal inconsistencies and contradictions, one or a few forged documents, unsupported fantastical tales that contradict common sense, experience, and science. Is that a trustworthy source on which to base your entire view of the world? No, not if you are rational.\n \n And on top of that, we point out the scientific facts that the Earth and Universe are billions of years old, and evolution does occur. Which is the more rational position: that God created humans out of dust/clay as the Bible says - for which the only testable prediction is that we should be made of dust/clay ... but we aren't - or that we humans are the result of an evolutionary process - for which there are lots of independent, objective evidences? The natural explanation, of course.\n \n Between (1) Christianity and any other God-involving religion, and (2) atheism, atheism is clearly the more rational and logical position. Rational thought can free people from the chains of religious mind control. I know ... I'm an example.",

Perhaps this is semantics though.\n \n \n \nYeah, and Deism didn't have talking burning bushes, water turning into wine, virgin births, God becoming human, and so on.\nI wasn't referring to Biblical myths here, but the underling basis of Deism. Man created God by using his rational to best justify the world around him. Atheism does the same today. Just as it being mankind's 'best guess' to the truth then does not make it true. The same applies today. I agree atheism is correct. Totally.

Time for you to just drop this part.\nFaith can take several form yes, but I feel that there is a similar element to strong atheism and deism. Put it another way, I know there is no God. Absolutely and certainly. That is not just a rational appraisal of the world, though of course that is a large part of it, but also a gut feeling. Hence faith, I claim to know something that I cannot really possibly know, but I have faith that it is the truth.\n \n As for your Star Wars analogy, well I think it can be conclusively proven that Star Wars is made up. We cannot conclusively prove there is no God-like entity (and I'm not talking about a Christian God specifically, but any 'supreme being').

Let me give you an example of how INSIDERS define atheism. \n \n \nAtheism is the lack of belief in any god(s). Not just the lack of belief in the Christian's god; this is the 'dominant god' or 'majority god' in the American scene, but it is not the first or only god that has been claimed by a group of believers. In fact, through history and around the world, thousands upon thousands of gods have been worshipped and forgotten (see for example Jordan 1993), and each god was believed in equally fervently by somebody. And each god appeared to do practical and miraculous things before the believers, supposedly confirming that god's reality and power.\n \n Atheists do not believe in the Christian god or any other of these past or present gods.\n (Natural Atheism, David Eller, American Atheists Press, 2004, p12-13)\n \n\n \n That comes from a book published by American Atheists Press, and was written by an author who is a life-long atheist. That is an INSIDER's definition of atheism.\n \n We can also go to the atheist sites on the web, such as Infidels.org.\n \n \nWhat is an Atheist?\n \n An atheist is a person who does not believe that any gods exist. \n (http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/atheism.html)\n \n\n \n Perhaps you don't know the difference between:\n \n 1) not believing that God exists\n \n and\n \n 2) believing that God does not exist\n \n Read them over a few times and think about it. You will see that the placement of the \"not\" makes a difference.\n \n \n \n If that didn't help, maybe this will ...\n \n \n\"What is atheism?\"\n \n Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of gods. This absence of belief generally comes about either through deliberate choice, or from an inherent inability to believe religious teachings which seem literally incredible. It is not a lack of belief born out of simple ignorance of religious teachings.\n \n Some atheists go beyond a mere absence of belief in gods: they actively believe that particular gods, or all gods, do not exist. Just lacking belief in Gods is often referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position; whereas believing that gods do not (or cannot) exist is known as \"strong atheism\".\n (http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/intro.html)\n \n\n \n Belief that God does not exist is a subset of atheism as a whole, but it is wrong to define a whole by just one of its subsets. For example, it would be just as wrong as defining Christianity as the belief that Jesus - as God - created the world in six 24-hour days, just 6 to 10 thousand years ago. Or as wrong as defining humans as Homo sapiens that have penises.\n \n \nPhunting: That stance surely takes faith.\n\n \n YOUR MISUNDERSTANDING of atheism takes faith.\n \n \n Come on, just admit it ...

I am a christian and I beleive many scientifically proven points that many christians (crackpots) don't. I even acknowledge the possibility of evolution and have a slight leaning towards the theory (as apposed to instantaneous creation).\n \n 2. You cannot ask christians to seperate God from science- though the seperation of God and science is irrelevent to the amount of scientific knowledge one can aqquire- because we beleive god created the universe in its intirety. It would be like trying to ask someone who knows the architect for the empire state building and who is analysing the building not to ask his friend questions about it. A person can analyse the building similarly without the architect but hey why not ask.\n \n 3. True christianity is not a religion, it is a relation, and as such it takes less faith than you may think. I do not need faith what so ever to acknowledge the presence of a person you live with, the same goes for God. The faith envolved is needed for beleiving the person can accomplish what they need to, the same goes for god. This is actually not that hard seeing as everyone supports their friends and if their friend had unlimeted power it would only make things that much easier.\n \n Thankyou all for baring with me,\n Omega\n \n PS: Thier will come a time when every knee will bow down and every tounge will confess that Jesus is God, the question I ask you is will you be bowing down as a loyal subject of a victorious king, a or a defeated prisoner awaiting his eternal sentence.",

   "2. You cannot ask christians to seperate God from science- though the seperation of God and science is irrelevent to the amount of scientific knowledge one can aqquire- because we beleive god created the universe in its intirety. It would be like trying to ask someone who knows the architect for the empire state building and who is analysing the building not to ask his friend questions about it. A person can analyse the building similarly without the architect but hey why not ask.\n\n \n I think you bring up a good point here, actually. The idea that religion and science can't exist together is a relatively recent widespread phenomenon. Early and well into the enlightenment, many of the most famous scientists were devout religious people. In fact some of them found that scientific discovery aided their devoutness, and conversely, their devoutness aided their scientific discovery. There was a time that sound scholarship and religion went together. \n \n There are still a lot of Christian scientists today, as well. The fact is, the two don't have to be juxtaposed. One certainly CAN believe in a Creator and evolution simultaneously--I'm living proof of that. The problem arises when people on either side assume that one TRUMPS the other. Fundamentalist Christians do this when they assume evolution can't be a reality because it doesn't jibe with their literal-only interpretation of the Bible. Athiest scientists do it when they assume that science renders the Bible truthless, even though it's a book of principles and spiritual truth. My view is that the Bible has no business trying to dictate and direct science, but science has no business trying to dictate and direct spiritual issues of faith either. The two deal with separate issues, and the problem arises when people try to dictate one with the other.",

   "DamEtel: Sorry, you don't get a cookie for being a good science-minded individual until you stop merely leaning towards evolution and go all the way to accepting it. .\n\n \n \nOmega: The thing is evolution is no more proven than creation.\n\n \n False and/or misleading.\n \n Your statement could be considered as misleading because of your use of the word 'proven'. Science isn't about literally proving things (as they say, \"proof is for mathematics and alcohol\"). The findings of science are tentative. And, since you are contrasting evolution and creation, the most straightforward reading is that you mean creation as proposed by Creationists. But, then, a supernatural \"theory\" - like Creation - cannot be proven at all. So your statement as worded really doesn't make any sense.\n \n If we assume the problem is just a unfortunate word choice on your part, and that you meant something more along the lines of: \"The thing is evolution has no more evidence supporting it than Creationism does\" then you are simply wrong. Evolution has tons of valid evidence supporting it: Creationism doesn't have any. Creationism is religion and actually goes AGAINST the scientific evidences.\n \n \nOmega: Both sides have presented positives and negatives for their theories, and both still firmly believe they are right. I am not sure on all of the details and dont want to become inbroiled in a creation V. evolution argument. \n\n \n Right! You are speaking out of ignorance. \n \n While it's refreshing for someone to admit their ignorance, it's troubling to see that same person say they know where things stand on the debate! Do you always make up your mind and act like you know the truth when you don't know the details?!\n \n 1) Creationism is NOT a scientific theory: it is religion. Period. \n \n 2) Evolution IS a scientific theory: one that has been supported more and more since it was first proposed about 150 years ago. \n \n When Darwin proposed evolution there were some difficulties with his theory. Let me address a few.\n \n 1) Darwin believed evolution would require at least 100 million years, but the earth was widely believed to be only about 6000 years old, and even when science entered into the debate, Lord Kelvin said it was only about 24 million years old. There just wasn't enough time for Darwin's view of evolution, it seemed. But Lord Kelvin didn't know about radioactive decay, which means his calculations were invalid: the earth could be MUCH older than he had calculated. This fact was discovered years AFTER Darwin had published his theory of evolution by means of natural selection. And since then, science has shown - CONCLUSIVELY - that our planet is about 4.5 billion years old. Much more than enough time from Darwin's perspective. Now, for Darwin's theory to possibly be right, the Earth had to be much older than most of his contemporaries believed it to be: yet, there was no real evidence for its being so. In a sense, then, Darwin's theory 'inadvertently' predicted an old earth, which, just happens to be the case. \n \n 2) The fossil record was a real problem for Darwin: far too many gaps. Despite the lies of Creationists, since Darwin's time, numerous transitional fossils have been found. We've found fossils that show the transition of some reptilian jaw bones into the ossicles of the mammalian middle ear. We've found fossils of tetrapods with fish characteristics, such as Acanthostega with its internal gills. And consider the fishapod Tiktaalik, which just made headlines a couple weeks ago: a \"perfect\" intermediate between fish and tetrapods. We have found Archeaopteryx, and others. Darwin's theory in a sense predicted that such fossils would be found, and they were.\n \n 3) Darwin didn't know how his theory could work as it relates to inheritance. Because the predominant view of the time held that traits were passed from parent to child by fluids, it seemed that one parent's favorable trait fluid would be mixed with the other parent - whose fluid lacked the good stuff. So in the first generation of offspring, the benefit would be cut in half. And in each subsequent generation, the good fluids would diluted further until they'd be essentially nonexistent. Then how in the world could Darwin's theory work?! HE DIDN'T KNOW!!!! The basic rules of PARTICULATE inheritance had been worked out by Mendel, a contemporary of Darwin's, but Darwin and most other scientists didn't pay attention to Mendel's work (only later were Mendel's findings 'rediscovered', at which point Mendel was given credit). So in a sense, Darwin's theory predicted that inheritance would work in a manner in which traits were not transmitted between generations by fluids, and he was right.\n \n 4) Darwin predicted, based on his theory, that humans' closest living relatives were the great apes. He had no good way of showing this: in fact, he made this prediction long before DNA was known to be the genetic material. So in a sense, about 150 years before the genomes of humans and chimps were sequenced, Darwin predicted that they would be extremely similar - that the closest match to human DNA would be from a great ape, like a chimp - and with about 98% base pairs matching, he was right.\n \n \n I've posted this before (in much more detail), but concerning the evolutionary origins of humans, there are several independent lines of evidence that confirm the proposal.\n \n 1) The 96% - 99% identity between the human and chimp genomes indicates common ancestry.\n \n 2) The multiple, conserved non-functional DNA sequences (pseudogenes) shared by both chimps and humans bolster the case of genetic relatedness by means of common descent and crush the \"common design\" counterargument.\n \n 3) The head-to-head fusion of two \"chimp\" chromosomes to form one of our human chromosomes.\n \n 4) The individual anatomical differences between humans and chimps being so minor: mostly differences in the mere size, shape, or amount of shared structures (brain size, arm length, jaw shape, curvature of spine, amount of hair, etc.). No major biological novelty separates the two species (and neoteny alone can explain several of the differences).\n \n 5) The nearly identical brain structure for chimps and humans, including several shared asymmetries.\n \n 6) The fact that chimps have several \"humanlike\" mental qualities, such as high intelligence, self-recognition, a sense of fairness - which is modulated according to strength of social bonds - and a rudimentary form of empathy.\n \n 7) The numerous hominid fossils that help document our evolutionary past. \n \n Together, all of these evidences - which come from multiple, independent, objective sources, and which are verifiable, at least in principle, by anyone - form a very convincing argument in support of our evolutionary origin. And, they show that the evolutionary position that humans evolved from a common ancestor we share with chimps is not mere extrapolation from the confirmed processes of microevolution and speciation. Evolutionists have both the logical extrapolation and the multiple supporting evidences.\n \n \n Oh, and please don't think that I've provided you with all of the evidence for evolution. There's much more.",

Read this article, and be sure and see the figures at the bottom. http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/12/05/MN153329.DTL&type=science\n \n It would be useful to have something specifically stating the similarities between humans and chimps, and to know if their genome is the same length. So, I won't say you're wrong yet, but it's not a given at this point that you're right either.",

Someone who did such a thing would be either completely ignorant of the how things worked, or too pigheaded to recognize his defeat.\n\n \n Dametel, what is your problem? If you are correct I don't mind saying so. Unlike you, I'm not here for my ego. Once again, you have illustrated exactly why you've been threatened to be banned, and since you asked about it in the forum in anothing thread recently, I plan to point out to you every time I see it in our exchanges.",
