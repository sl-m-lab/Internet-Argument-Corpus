   "The National Organization for Marriage is not a 'hate group'. (Anymore than any political group is) You just don't like them because they don't go along with your politics.\n\n \n Jyoshu yes NOM certainly is a hate group. And I'm not saying this because either I am a homosexual or because I am now a professed Atheist either. Spirituality is now irrelevant in my life and the opinions of these people no longer garner any judgment upon my mind.\n \n Now, you may assume they are a hate group because of their opinions. Well this is a very broad assumption here. Why call someone a hate group simply because they are opposed to same sex marriage?\n \n That in turn is partially true except when we examine NOM's methods of giving their opinion on the subject. See it is not their stance on the issue that warrants the label hate group, but the way they conduct their presentations and the evidence they use to present their case.\n \n \n You see, many of NOM's presentations are sadly skewed. They hold no basis in reality, no basis upon the grounds of law that govern us in modern times. If NOM presented their case based upon lets say DOMA or a legal standpoint I would actually respect their claims based upon a legal level.\n \n But it's not. I've sat through several of their sermons and all I found was the same tired, scared propaganda that fans the fires of prejudice and keeps the masses in turn spellbound.\n \n They use fear, even flat out untrue \"facts\" about homosexuals to propagate their point of view. Had they just given legal grounds based upon DOMA or even well factual evidence to support their claims, they wouldn't be dismissed as another fringe group like FRC or Westboro.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nChanging marriage to include other things would be a form of special rights--it's expanding marriage to where it could apply to anything and everything. We might as well grant polygamy rights, if we're going to start doing that. It's 'gay rights', not civil rights.\n\n \n \n And how exactly is there a line defined there? Who believes or accepts polygamy? Probably a very small sect in reality. You see like most religious people, you assume the worst. The doomsday scenario that has been ingrained into your mind since your upbringing. \n \n Your always taught to assume the worst. So when it comes to gay marriage you assume it will lead to bestiality, polygamy, and other things that the religious community bring forward which are very small sects compared to the overall acceptance and evidence regarding homosexuals that show we have rather a positive impact upon society than a negative.\n \n We're not wife swapping, or violating an animal or raping a young child. We're consenting with another adult, a human in some form or fashion in an expression of love.\n \n Now love is a slippery slope concept in and of itself, but when you look at civil unions and then look at full blown marriage you can see that one pales in comparison to the other.\n \n The point being is everyone's rights are special. Just because you feel entitled or vindicated because your religion tells you you are in no way gives you a free ride when it comes to rights. Even your religious rights are held together by the same mortar that holds together my homosexual rights.\n \n The Constitution. The Bill of Rights, The Declaration. One cannot deny that without them and the enlightenment and the vision of men like the Masons we simply would not be where we as a Country and as a society are today.",

   "i apologize my fellow atheists, but gansao has brought this topic up many times, possibly unnecessarily and he is right!\n \n according to the words homosexual marriage proponents follow, \"love has no gender\". if love has no gender, why cant love have no previous family relationship? (bit of an awkward sentence, there) why not fight for polygamist marriages, as well seeing as love doesnt need to have a set number of 2? what if 4 people (dude chick dude chick) fall in love with each other and want to get married? why deny them that right?\n \n i think (correct me, gansao) that gansao has once said that he not only approves of gay marriages, he goes one step further and approves all marriages amongst consenting, well-minded people; and that's a very admirable position. he calls all marriages or sexual acts other than dude-chick \"deviant\", which i think is somewhat of an inappropriate term, but no matter, but so far as i can tell, he has never applied an aura of negativity towards any acts which he calls \"deviant\". \n \n of course, i would argue that we should be fighting for freedom of marriage, but in steps. allow all marriage \"deviances\" all at once and Easyrider's head might explode. and none of us want that, right? ...right???\n\n \n No what Gansao is doing is thinking himself clever. He says he doesn't oppose gay marriage, but he is very subtle how he associates it with polygamy and incest. He paints a picture that he is all about the freedom to marry so much so that it only seems fair to open it to gays it should be opened up to polygamists and close relatives. So now all three are linked, the argument used to object to polygamy and incest will automatically include gay marriage. \n \n I have already given him reasons that incest is illegal, he feels genetic mutations and historical evidence of the abuse suffered when there was less restriction and enforcement of incest laws are insufficient or happen anyway, so why bother. That abortion and sterilization are viable solutions to overcome the issues involved. \n \n As for Polygamy, it is legal in a number of places over the world, but not put into practice very much. Most countries were it is illegal have done so for religious reasons. This despite that the major religions all practiced it as evidenced throughout the sacred texts of each. So if you take religion out of the mix then there really is no basis for it being prohibited as long as each member is willing and able free of coercion to enter into that type of relationship and leave under the same conditions. \n \n If he really wants to come out for gay marriage then come out for it alone, without the others and without the degrading language. If he is for allowing incest and polygamy he can fight for those separately with even more zeal if he wants, which would be appropriate since all three share only minor similarities, while having significant differences.",

   "Incest and Polygamy are not Natural\nI guess that depends on your definition of \"natural\". If you define natural as doing things that are the standard norm for a society than neither one is natural and being gay probably isn't either (at roughly 8% of the population the norm would be the opposite). Now if you define normal as defined by genetics or a majority of genetics/pre-birth environment then incest is probably \"natural\" as is many other things like alcoholism (which is scary) and intelligence. It is suspected homosexuality falls into this category as well. I honestly don't know where polygamy falls into this.

However, no one seems to be consistent and support prohibition of sex, or at least procreation, in these cases. Essentially, an argument that applies to many cases is only applied to incest.\n \n At this point I would like to add that I WOULD support a consistent eugenic policy implication - ie, prohibition of procreation in these cases. But before you accuse me of supporting forced abortions and similar, actual policies would be \"mild\" in nature, primarily stimulative.\n \n Fourth, considering above, I do declare that people who support homosexual marriage and oppose incest on the grounds listed above are in this point hypocritical.

   "I'll have to support Gansao in general terms here.\n \n First, I only support rational arguments and believe the \"squick\" factor should be rationally removed from discussion in order to keep it on a rational level.\n \n Second, maybe it's because I'm an only child and have only imprinted on my parents, never having any sisters to imprint on, but I find incest a very minor issue and am not \"squicked\" by it and don't really understand others' opposition to it.\n \n Third, while I do acknowledge that incest is more likely to cause genetic defects (but also strengthen desired genetic traits, don't forget), I observe that genetic defects are likely in many other families. However, no one seems to be consistent and support prohibition of sex, or at least procreation, in these cases. Essentially, an argument that applies to many cases is only applied to incest.\n \n At this point I would like to add that I WOULD support a consistent eugenic policy implication - ie, prohibition of procreation in these cases. But before you accuse me of supporting forced abortions and similar, actual policies would be \"mild\" in nature, primarily stimulative.\n \n Fourth, considering above, I do declare that people who support homosexual marriage and oppose incest on the grounds listed above are in this point hypocritical. They fail to observe their own arguments from a neutral position and don't recognize it. A bit of a disappointment.\n\n \n I look at incest not just from the potential genetic problems but from the psychological impact it has and the increased occurrence of abuse inflicted on minors. It becomes easier to look at two \"normal\" adults and say it is only an accident of birth that keeps them from being married, but incest laws address not just that situation. Look historically at what were the results on society and individuals when incest was permitted and then later not enforced. Sure you can argue that anything that can happen in an incestuous relationship can be found outside of one, but does that mean we just throw our hands in the air and say oh well? As an extreme people kill people so there would be no point in making it a crime?\n \n Polygamy is illegal for religious and political reasons and given the same protections monogamous relationships enjoy there really is no rational argument against it. Incest though has a broad range of negative repercussions and when balanced against the potential benefits the reasons for it are not that compelling.",

   "Polygamy presents enormous difficulties when you consider that civil marriage is first and foremost a legal contract. (Which it was, by the way, long before it was a religious sacrament. Religion frowned on the institution before throwing in the towel and co-opting it.) An arrangement between two parties becomes exponentially more complex when you add even one, much less two or more, and the result would inevitably be a logistical nightmare.\n\n \n Under a legal contract premise it would not be any more difficult than shareholders or LLC members changing their status.\n \n \nAre they all supposed to be considered equally married to each other? If so what happens in the case of divorce? Can one person divorce only one (or a few) of the others, yet remain married to the remainder? \n\n \n Yes and yes\n \n \nDo we draw a line at a specific number of participants? Or could, say, the population of the state of New Jersey theoretically all marry each other? \n\n \n \n I think we could but most likely that would not be a problem as consent would always be required. \n \n Ha let the IRS deal with that tax return.\n \n \nAlso, the type of relationship typified by real-world polygamy--at least the ones taken to court in the US--tend to be religion or cult-based patriarchal set-ups with one man and many wives (some of whom may also be blood-related), more resembling harems than the sexually-faithful, mutually devoted, 50/50 relationships the vast majority of people envisage as being core to the whole notion of modern marriage.\n\n \n Because swingers know that God is not the one commanding them to have another wife. Non religious people who do things like wife swap hold an entirely different view of marriage and the purpose it serves.\n \n \nThe problems associated with legalized polygamy, imho, vastly outnumber those resulting from other non-traditional marital forms, which is why I don't think any same-sex slippery slope is going to open any floodgates for it, scare-mongering fundies notwithstanding.\n\n \n Most of us would end up one marriage at a time and that I think would be enough to keep society from a downhill spiral, but their is a % of people who can be just as productive in an alternative environment.",

Do you honestly think that if it were legal there would not be any takers willing to have a free pass at their daughters?\n\n Actually, that's exactly what I'm saying. Imprinting is what really prevents incest, not laws, and the fact that so many people are so squicked by it is perfect evidence that imprinting works!\n \n Look, I really honestly believe that even were incest legal, you'd have practically no more of it than you already have.\n \n \nNo some places consenting adults having sex is illegal when they are to closely related. What varies is how closely related.\n\n But illegal to what level? Really, it makes a difference when something is frowned upon, when something is grounds for preventive measures and when something is criminalized.\n \n \nEven your belief that genetic strengths are encouraged thru inbreeding is in part true but still produces unusually high occurances of genetic flaws requiring a greater number of animals to be culled.

They aren't like puppies or chickens, can't get them fixed or make bar b que out of them.\n\n Reread my argument, please. I don't see incest as good or anything. What I do see is that the only real rational argument against it is the genetic trouble with offspring (all other arguments are actually problems that cause incest, not consequences of incest). And here, I see hipocrisy. We're prohibiting incest, but are not instituting a global consistent policy that would apply to any and all parents where genetic risks exist. Adult heterosexual consenting non-related parents whose procreation is almost guaranteed to cause genetic defects? We leave it to them to decide and choose the preventive measures. Related? Prohibit regardless of chance. \n \n And really, I would actually fully support such a (yes, very invasive) globally consistent policy. The double standard annoys me, not that I advocate incest (something people here fail to acknowledge).\n \n \nThose stereotypes are not all completely false\n\n But onus probandi is still on you...\n \n \nIs there any crime that is not illegal? I don't see how you could possibly regulate something like incest with any hope of reasonable success. \n\n All crimes are illegal, but not all that is illegal is a crime. Very important to a lawyer (my education is in the field of law)\n \n \nAs I stated in an earlier post polygamy is legal in more places than it isn't it just isn't practiced very often. But I don't see too many problems being created by it conditioned on some safe guards like consent to enter into and exit out of.\n\n See? Amusingly, it's self regulating, isn't it? You want more wives, you need to be able to afford them.\n \n The real problem with polygamy lies elsewhere. Wherever we see it, it's not a mark of freedom, it's a relic of patriarchal or matriarchal superiority of one sex over the other. That's why it got prohibited these days, but by now, you'd actually get a few rare cases where the counter arguments wouldn't apply. Actually, we do see it happening, with people living together as a family, just without a marriage certificate.\n \n \n \nIt really is a bad piece of business\n \n The National Center for Victims of Crime - Library/Document Viewer\n\n I read it. As I already pointed out - the issues of consent and abuse applied to ALL relations already have it all covered. Really, re-read the article: it only deals with incestual abuse. It does not even mention the possiblity of consensual incest.\n \n Now, incestual abuse, that's a problem indeed.

   "Actually, that's exactly what I'm saying. Imprinting is what really prevents incest, not laws, and the fact that so many people are so squicked by it is perfect evidence that imprinting works!\n \n \n Look, I really honestly believe that even were incest legal, you'd have practically no more of it than you already have.\n \n \n But illegal to what level? Really, it makes a difference when something is frowned upon, when something is grounds for preventive measures and when something is criminalized.\n \n \n Reread my argument, please. I don't see incest as good or anything. What I do see is that the only real rational argument against it is the genetic trouble with offspring (all other arguments are actually problems that cause incest, not consequences of incest). And here, I see hipocrisy. We're prohibiting incest, but are not instituting a global consistent policy that would apply to any and all parents where genetic risks exist. Adult heterosexual consenting non-related parents whose procreation is almost guaranteed to cause genetic defects? We leave it to them to decide and choose the preventive measures. Related? Prohibit regardless of chance. \n \n And really, I would actually fully support such a (yes, very invasive) globally consistent policy. The double standard annoys me, not that I advocate incest (something people here fail to acknowledge).\n \n \n But onus probandi is still on you...\n \n \n All crimes are illegal, but not all that is illegal is a crime. Very important to a lawyer (my education is in the field of law)\n \n \n See? Amusingly, it's self regulating, isn't it? You want more wives, you need to be able to afford them.\n \n The real problem with polygamy lies elsewhere. Wherever we see it, it's not a mark of freedom, it's a relic of patriarchal or matriarchal superiority of one sex over the other. That's why it got prohibited these days, but by now, you'd actually get a few rare cases where the counter arguments wouldn't apply. Actually, we do see it happening, with people living together as a family, just without a marriage certificate.\n \n \n \n I read it. As I already pointed out - the issues of consent and abuse applied to ALL relations already have it all covered. Really, re-read the article: it only deals with incestual abuse. It does not even mention the possiblity of consensual incest.\n \n Now, incestual abuse, that's a problem indeed. It has all the trouble of abuse, plus the added aggravation of the abuser being someone close to the one abused, shattering the illusions we form our personalities on even more profoundly than regular\n\n \n \n \nHowever, riddle me this: which case of incestual abuse would not be adequately covered by regular abuse prohibiting laws?\n\n \n Emancipated minors or parental consent for marriage for minors (I think Alabama is still 14 with consent)?\n \n \n \n \nNow, to maybe restate: I'm generally liberal in these issues.

   "<sic<\n \n Listen, pappi, homosexual sin is not unforgiveable by God. ALL have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, and need Christ for redemption. But gays and straights alike have to REPENT OF THEIR SINS and ask Christ to be their Lord and Savior for the remission of their sins. \n\n \n What the heck did Jesus die for if we are still in our sins? As for Jesus how come the only place Jesus says he is necessary for salvation is in John? You would think something that important would not slip through the cracks of not 1 not 2 but 3 Gospel accounts. Good thing John remembered or we would all be SOL huh. Maybe there is a reason it is not until John that these statements are attributed to Jesus \n \n \n \nThe problem with gays around here is that due to their personal bias in wanting to keep pursuing gay sex sin, their hearts appear to be too hardened to repent.\n\n \n What do you expect according to Paul God made them that way. It is biblical evidence that it is not a choice, exactly what they have been saying all along. You have a problem with gay people take it up with God.\n \n \nI would advise gays (and straights) to repent, ask Christ to forgive them of all their sins, and make him their Lord and Savior. Then ask the Holy Spirit for help with any gay or straight sex sin issues they have.\n\n \n I would advise you to try and come up with better advise. Put some thought into it.\n \n \n \nI also think one of the failures of those who claim to be \"former Christians\" is that they never totally repented of their sins and they never totally surrendered their lives and will to Christ and made him Lord of their lives. They may have gone to church for 20 years and did everything else, but forgot those important things. \n\n \n Maybe, but not conclusive or convincing since you can't guarantee that you have it right either. You don't have to admit it, but not doing so doesn't change the fact you got your fingers crossed that you picked the right horse.\n \n \nAll this is a tip for you and yours to keep you out of Hell when you die, so remember it always.\n\n \n I actually do and hope you do the same.",

For me it's not about just letting Gay people get married, it's about denying the rights of individuals simply because they are gay. I get the point about Incest and Polygamy, But as I pointed out earlier, there is no one shouting for Anyone to be allowed to marry their Sister. If there was enough people out there and a Movement started claiming that their individual Rights are being denied simply because some guy wants to marry his Mother then maybe it would be different. But People , specifically Christian Zealots, use this Incest/Polygamy argument all the time, and it is irrelevant to the subject of Gay Marriage. \n The Morals in this country are defined by Religion, that's where we got it wrong.

That though doesn't make them comparable and it is the differences between them that you ignore that makes your argument a false continuum and a weak analogy.\n \n \nUsing this arument in an incestphobe way is just like using HIV against gay sex...it should be prevented because.....\n\n \n Another weak analogy. I have given other reasons that incest is not comparable. Reproduction is just one and remains a valid reason for not legalizing it. Will you ever give a reason supporting your position that it should be? I mean other than if gays get to then Dads, Daughters, Moms, Sons, Aunts and Uncles should to. One has nothing to do with the other.\n \n \nI did not ..you lie\n\n \n Your right you don't always blame the victim, you only think if she drinks and/or promises and she gets raped what did she think was going to happen. The penalty for such behavior, because you do believe it was wrong but a 20 should cover it and no record that might make it hard for the guy later on.\n \n Originally Posted by gansao View Post\n It is myth that rape is a crime of violence and control only.\n The violence and control is the way the sexual attacker achieves sexual release.\n Some pedophiles have been known to violently attack children but by far the most of them groom and coerce them into it.\n Many 'rapes' are the result of women getting drunk and passing out or changing their minds just before intercourse..this is of course a sexual assault but the correct penalty should be a fine of not less than \u00a35 but not more than \u00a310.\n \n and later \n \n If I were stupid enough to go to a gay bar, pick up a gay man ,offer him sex then stop him doing it at the last moment then I could only blame myself if he tried to force me.\n Only people who live in their own little bubble, like you, think otherwise.\n I would not'deserve' to be attacked but I would not be surprised if I were.\n Same fine for the gay man\n \n The discussion continued back and forth until you decided to understand what had been told to you a number of times. I only referenced the beginning, but seems clear to me I wasn't lying.\n \n \nYou have used both ad hominem and strawman arguments because you have nothing else..\n.\n \n Tell you what you drop off your sarcasm I'll drop mine. If you would like to make it a little more formal then start with yourself, you might find it sets a tone for the rest of the dicussion.

   "Whats interesting is how all cases of categories of marriage that involve potentially broadening marriage really just involves one more qualifier to the benefits. First a man and woman. Then an adult man and woman. Then a just two adults, but TWO adults. Will the 'two' be removed and then only the word 'adults' remain in the list of criteria? Oh, don't forget 'consenting'. For now, anyways.\n\n \n See marriage is a constantly changing concept that has survived various cultural interpretations and practices, yet is still regarded as important enough to have this continuous battle over who gets to and who doesn't. If you take religion out of the equation what is the basis of not permitting to consenting adults from regardless of gender entering into that group of benefits and responsibilities we have labeled marriage? Nothing is added and nothing is taken away. \n \n This country is founded in part on the idea that freedom to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness is not possible if you do not posses the freedom to decide matters that effect your person. Hence adults, capacity, consent which also in part why certain people may not marry. \n \n \n \nI think people need to step back and remember some things. One, the issue is marriage benefits and redefining criteria to get them. At least that's the REAL issue. For gays, the issue is (though they often won't admit this) validation. Gays would find much more support if they were simply FOR the benefits they need (when that's the arguments they give) rather than trying to be called \"married\" in a cultural sense. \n \n \n They are for the benefits. You think this is all about some queen who wants to walk down the isle in white satin and is throwing a tantrum because she can't? Marriage is just a term used to describe a recognized and protected set of agreements between two people. Church, god and/or a priest are unnecessary to gain those rights, they just have to be married.\n \n \n \nCivil unions has more support and would probably be available NOW for gays if they would fight toward that. Instead, they seek to co-opt a heterosexual institution and piggyback off of it. THAT is why there is so much opposition to it. So when a gay pride person says something like \"two consenting adults\" they are still applying criteria, and therefore not holding to the view of equality.\n\n \n If Civil Unions were granted the same status as marriage you would probably have a lot of takers, but it isn't. \n \n So what your saying is it isn't the results that is the problem it's the word that is causing so much trouble?\n \n Oh come on, really this all or nothing argument where if gays are allowed then we are hypocrites if we don't let 5 year old siblings marry their puppies and each other is weak. If you want to be really fair then don't let anyone get married or reduce it to nothing more than a ceremony. That protects the kiddies and we have equality. You think M/F couples would have a problem with not being able to get married? So then why is it so hard to understand why gays are upset?\n \n \nFor instance, why is not hypocritical to be for two people of the same gender getting married, but not a 17 year old and an 18 year old? (When some 17 year olds are MORE mature than some 18 year-olds)\n\n \n Consent was not always at 18. It used to be 21 and younger can become emancipated and maturity has nothing to do with it. Many people spend the first 21 years being taught to be a member of society at which point the training is over and it's time to swim. The needs of the military were deemed a fitting crash course dropping consent to 18. Why these numbers were and are the magic numbers there is no one right answer, but that 17 year old will eventually be able unless that 18 year old is the same gender.\n \n \nAnd that goes to show the problem--there's NO end to this madness. We're not talking about a slippery-slope--it's simply evaluating the precedents we're setting here on messing with marriage and toying around with it like a political football.\n\n \n What will break? What are the possible repercussions? I have looked and asked and get nothing but weak baseless reasons or because it will. \n \n \nTwo, never has any small of a minority been given so much lopsided press and attention. It would be fascinating to see a study on how much press time the gay pride movement gets compared to other groups even larger in size who need things or feel unfairly treated. How are gays keeping their pet issues always at the forefront of the news and media when there are so much wide-reaching needs in our society? I think a lot of the concern out there they call 'homophobia' is people simply saying, in a way, 'what the heck???'\n\n \n Because straight people like to watch it the news. If they didn't then the ratings would dictate looking for other stories. So A why does it matter and B should they get penalized because they get news coverage? Go rob banks or run over people in your car you will see less gay folk in the news.\n \n Why is there so much gay coverage on the news, because your watching a TV :p emoticon_rolleyes",

   "if were talking about pedophilia, it can happen regardless of family relationship or number of participants. allowing incestuous marriages is not allowing pedophilia marriages.\n \n \n I agree with both statements.\n \n \nit isnt more dangerous, if a brother and sister want to get married, who are we to step in?\n \n \n Again the fear is, and to clarify not necessarily my fear, but one of the general reasons behind incest laws, not a brother and sister who grow up normal and healthy and find they are the only compatible people for each other. As I said this scenario is difficult to argue against especially if you take kids out of the equation. At that point there really isn't any logical objection. When you have an adult capable of brainwashing a child into wanting to marry a family member thru coercion or manipulation and given that some states allow marriage at 14, 15, 16 with parental consent or emancipation you run into a gray area as it is no longer legally pedophilia.\n \n \nif 4 people (two dudes, two chicks) want to get married, who are we to step in? my business is not in other people's marriages or personal relationships, so long as they are not causing harm. the only restrictions i can think of would be age - pedophilia is definitely a crime against humanity and should not be allowed by any means... but other than that, who are we to step in?\n\n \n Again I agree, if some hippie wants to marry a tree or some yuppie his BMW, I will think they are both odd birds but that is the reason there is chocolate and vanilla in the world. Some like one some the other. Two same or opposite sex adults enjoy all the freedoms that this country allows or at least they should, Polygamy I won't argue as long as reasonable protections are in place allowing for equitable exit and consensual acceptance. \n \n Incest for me like I stated earlier has a lot of corners where things can hide and I can see scenarios where it would be more acceptable than others, but my point of the post was not to defend the continued illegality of incest and polygamy but to point out the sideways argument of Gansao.\n \n There is no hypocrisy in supporting gay marriage and not incest, just as there is no reason to think permitting one shows bias towards the others. They are three distinctly different issues that can have, depending on perception, some similarities, but have numerous differences that keep them incomparable when viewed in their entirety.",

You then avoid any questions put to you that have the potential to make you argue the specifics of your statements. That part is cowardly. Your position has been refuted as well as can be with you running away from any meaningful dialogue concerning your view.That you ignore most of what has been stated in opposition while offering nothing to counter can only mean you don't have the ability to do so, \n \n \nStating that I was not actually saying what I was writing but had some kind of hidden agenda( yeah a hidden agenda on a forum with a handful of posters).\n\n \n I agree but you still did it. I am sure it makes sense to you.\n \n \nYou agreed with this , not because it is true, there is no evidence apart from unfounded accusations..if you can find it ..show me.\n You agreed because you are a coward ..you havent got enough balls to support your own argument against your friends.\n\n \n Yes there is evidence. Do you think the universe conspired against you to plant these thoughts into the unsuspecting minds of several people here?\n \n \nNot only a coward but a liar too judging by these last few posts.\n \n You are ok blowing smoke up the born again atheists arses and and handbagging EZ with the rest of the stooges but you havent got the guts to face them up yourself.\n I dont agree with EZ but hes not a coward like you and is a man... unlike you.\n\n \n Bitter table for one. \n \n For someone who really has a problem with the personal attacks you sure are quick to deal them out.\n \n I liked your other avatar better, you should bring her back.",
