   "Xcaliber \n \nOriginally Posted by guntoter4contro View Post\n Instead of more gun control, how about bullet control? How about if your local police department was the only place you could buy bullets?\n How about instead of trying to take away more of our rights they implement stronger penalties for crime, that is the Solution we need.\n It wasn't all that long ago when Americans would hang a man for stealing a horse, and they didn't hang him in some back room with 10 witnesses, no they Strung him up in the town square for all to see. Damn sure made the next guy think twice before he went after someones Horse...\n \n Take this current shooting for instance. There were at least 100 witnesses who saw this XXXXX shoot down all those people. But with all the bleeding hearts in this country this guy will probably not serve one day in prison. He's INNOCENT until proven guilty under our current system of Law. The fact that this was a premeditated act is enough proof to believe he is not insane , he planned this and carried it out. IMO they should take him out and load him into a big cannon, shoot him into a brick wall and sell the event on Pay Per view. Not only could we use the Money to help pay down the debt in this country, but we would save a few Million on a trial to PROVE him guilty even though we already know he did it. I bet the next Whacko who decides to go on a killing spree would think twice about it.\n \n No.. taking our Guns away or limiting our rights through Strict gun Laws is not the Solution. Growing a Pair of Balls to stiffen the penalties for these types of Crime is the Solution. A Criminal will find a way to get a gun, knife, baseball bat, or any number of weapons so all you anti-gunnies are doing is trying to limit Citizens of our right to defend ourselves.\n\n \n \"Americans have grown too soft..\"\n I agree as alot of others know doubt do but what about alot of anti-gunners\n that wouldn't come out and say so, and the poll is private.",
