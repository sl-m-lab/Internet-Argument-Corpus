   "SCOTUS will again consider the legality of the only US State permitting assisted suicide: \n \n http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=514&e=3&u=/ap/20050222/ap_on_go_su_co/scotus_assisted_suicide\n \n Another states right dumped for increasing federal control? \n \n A panel of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (news - web sites) sided with Oregon last May. \"The attorney general's unilateral attempt to regulate general medical practices historically entrusted to state lawmakers interferes with the democratic debate about physician-assisted suicide,\" wrote Judge Richard Tallman in the 2-1 opinion. \n \n If this isn't another thinly disguised effort to push federal control using federal dangerous drug legislation as a hammer, I'd certainly appreciate alternative reasoning. Another important factor is the presence of the Catholic and Mormon Churches in Oregon, the two largest Christian denominations in Oregon who publicly don't believe in suicide, and yet the assisted suicide law still passed by a popular majority vote, twice. As usual, what the people want means zip to our Washington leaders if they don't make the decision.",

   "How do you propose to regulate assisted suicide? Who is going to decide, the physician and patient? Who is going to decide if the patient is comatose?\n I would like to think at least a set of criteria would be utilized in order that euthanasia would not be abused. However, generic criteria would not be appropriate to determine the right to die, in my opinion. People are just not informed enough about disease, medical treatments, etc. and generally take the opinion of their personal physician as the gospel\n \n I find that a person who is given 6 months to live with a terminal illness is way too liberal to use as criteria for euthanasia. I have seen several people given the no hope \"keep patient comfortable\" order, only to find these people get better, leave the hospital and live several years.\n I think that a person should be comatose for a given time before euthanasia is entertained. I also think that at least 5 of 6 family members should be in agreement in this instance. \n \n Isn't that just like government, the amount of federal dollars that is spent on patients whose quality of life is nil must run in the millions, and the government would rather continue to spend money on surgeries, procedures, and other health care treatments than to create a choice that would end some spending on hopeless cases. After all, that is what the government is concerned with, monies spent and not about the people themselves. \n \n There are a lot of unprotected people in the nation, particuarly nursing home patients with no immediate family--or none within a reasonable distance, that participate in their lives. There are a lot of physicians that capitalize on the money paid for health care for these patients. \n \n The government is worried about using drugs in an inappropriate amount for one aspect of medical care? They are not even being reasonable--there are more issues to euthanasia than that. \n \n There are government organizations already in place to police the health care practices of physicians and hospitals. With a random selection reviewed at quarterly intervals based on codes from hospital charts. They really do a poor job in identifying infractions in patient care. I doubt the watchdogs on euthanasia would identify one half of any misconduct among physicians. \n \n I thought it was odd that Catholics were a religious majority in Utah, but I don't find it strange that Mormons would vote for this measure. They hold baptisms for the dead--so it wouldn't make any difference in their religious practices.\n \n I used to be in favor of euthanasia, but I am not so much for it anymore. I am just ambivalent about the issue. There are some positive things and negative, and it really has to be personalized and I don't see this happening and I fear euthanasia would be abused.",

   "On Friday I will be part of a debate about Euthanasia, I am for Euthanasia and these are my views:\n \n The subject of voluntary euthanasia is far from simple - even the most sympathetic cases raise difficult ethical questions. \n First I shall talk about involuntary Euthanasia. If someone you love has slipped into a coma and you have been told that they are in a persistent vegetative state, what would you do? That one person alone is costing the tax payers; yes that's you at the back, thousands of pounds per week. All this money just to keep them, what some would call 'alive'. The fact is that this is no life for a person. They are already mentally dead; why not free their soul in the kindest way possible instead of prolonging death and suffering?\n Pro-euthanasia campaigners say it is a matter of personal freedom if you wish to participate in voluntary mercy killing. As suicide is no longer a crime in the UK, they argue that it is not only just, but also an essential part of civilisation that people can be helped to die in dignity and pain free. They argue that refusing to help someone is immoral. It could even cause more injury and distress, if their suicide attempt fails. I believe that people should be allowed the choice of whether to die with dignity or without. However, Voluntary euthanasia should only be allowed in certain situations, just because someone is suffering from a disease and has to live without their independence and needs to have 24 hour care it doesn't mean that they are a candidate for euthanasia, what I am suggesting is if this person in question is suffering from round the clock pain and they wish to be put out of their misery what gives us the right to turn a blind eye and allow them to suffer.\n Some religious groups believe that life is so sacred that only god can decide when to terminate it. Others worry that allowing any system of legalised killing would be open to abuse. \n I think that when debating such a sensitive topic we should consider those who it affects the most. By this I mean we need to consider the relatives. When faced with their loved ones' pain, and often the indignity of their condition, many are desperate and believe the best course is for their relative to die. Recently the family of Mary Ormerod, who died after being starved of food and fluids, praised the doctor involved as being caring and committed. Although euthanasia is illegal in the UK, there are some grey areas. A doctor can legally give a person an overdose of something like morphine - even if they know it will kill the patient.\n In religious terms the body is treated as a vessel, a physical body that carries the divine within. The physical body is discarded once it can no longer function and the soul goes to be with god. Hindus and Buddhists believe that each of us has to fulfil a purpose or role in this physical materialistic world. We have a duty or responsibility to each other, we should threat others as we want to be treated (something we would all like!). With this in mind, if an older person was dying and they requested for their life to end sooner, you would be fulfilling your responsibility or duty to your elder, by helping them end their life.\n In the case of animals how many of you have or know of someone who has had a pet 'put down'? You get to the vet, he makes a diagnosis, such as cancer and hey presto before you know it your pet has a one way ticket across rainbow bridge! All in the space of about 10 minutes! Why or how is it that we can decide within minutes that an animal should be put out of their misery but when it comes to a human animal we do everything in our power to prolong death and suffering?\n Another strong argument against euthanasia is that a cure might be discovered for the particular illness that the person is suffering from. They argue that the best course of action is to keep the person alive, just in case that miraculous cure is found. This is all about chance and what ifs... I mean I would love to go out with Brad Pitt, it could happen, highly unlikely but it could, but I have to say I am not about to sit around and wait for him, just in case!\n Yes, there are certain instances where new drugs have helped people with incurable diseases but this is just prolonging eventual suffering and death, how can you be expected to live a fulfilling and happy life knowing your existence is being sustained by a few pills, knowing that anything you do may cause certain death. \n I ask you, what is so wrong with Voluntary Euthanasia when it is someone's dying wish? If it is already happening in the grey areas of the law why not spread light and learn from a situation? Surely if euthanasia is wanted or administered to ease a suffering there is no wrong in the action? How can you possibly justify watching someone suffer a great deal of pain when you could be the one that helps them? How is it that we are taught to respect our elders and respect other people's opinions and beliefs but when it comes to voluntary euthanasia the government disagree with it completely?\n \n Thats part of what I shall be saying",

   "The state of Oregon has had an assisted suicide law for nine years now. There has been no evidence of abuse. By all measures it has been extremely successful. The senior community in Oregon is very much in favor of this law. Assisted suicide is not euthanasia. It is voluntary. It cannot be requested by anyone but the patient. These are the requirements:\n \n \nDeath with Dignity Act Requirements\n \n The Death with Dignity Act (DWDA) allows terminally ill Oregon residents to obtain and use prescriptions from their physicians for self-administered, lethal medications. Under the Act, ending one's life in accordance with the law does not constitute suicide. The DWDA specifically prohibits euthanasia, where a physician or other person directly administers a medication to end another's life.\n \n To request a prescription for lethal medications, the DWDA requires that a patient must be:\n \u0095 An adult (18 years of age or older),\n \u0095 A resident of Oregon,\n \u0095 Capable (defined as able to make and communicate health care decisions), and\n \u0095 Diagnosed with a terminal illness that will lead to death within six months.\n \n Patients meeting these requirements are eligible to request a prescription for lethal medication from a licensed Oregon physician. To receive a prescription for lethal medication, the following steps must be fulfilled:\n \u0095 The patient must make two oral requests to his or her physician, separated by at least 15 days.\n \u0095 The patient must provide a written request to his or her physician, signed in the presence of two witnesses.\n \u0095 The prescribing physician and a consulting physician must confirm the diagnosis and prognosis.\n \u0095 The prescribing physician and a consulting physician must determine whether the patient is capable.\n \u0095 If either physician believes the patient's judgment is impaired by a psychiatric or psychological disorder, the patient must be referred for a psychological examination.\n \u0095 The prescribing physician must inform the patient of feasible alternatives to DWDA, including comfort care, hospice care, and pain control.\n \u0095 The prescribing physician must request, but may not require, the patient to notify his or her next-of-kin of the prescription request.\n To comply with the law, physicians must report to the Department of Human Services (DHS) all prescriptions for lethal medications. Reporting is not required if patients begin the request process but never receive a prescription. In 1999, the Oregon legislature added a requirement that pharmacists must be informed of the prescribed\n medication's intended use. Physicians and patients who adhere to the requirements of the Act are protected from criminal prosecution, and the choice of DWDA cannot affect the status of a patient's health or life insurance policies. Physicians, pharmacists, and health care systems are under no obligation to participate in the DWDA. The Oregon Revised Statutes specify that action taken in accordance with the DWDA does not constitute suicide, mercy killing or homicide under the law. Links to statutes can be found at http://oregon.gov/DHS/ph/pas/ors.shtml.\n\n \n Statistics and other details can be found  here.",

There are data on patients who have received prescriptions for lethal medications and died after taking the medications. There is little information, however, on physicians' experiences with requests for assistance with suicide. \n \n Methods Between February and August 1999, we mailed a questionnaire to physicians who were eligible to prescribe lethal medications under the Oregon Death with Dignity Act. \n \n Results Of 4053 eligible physicians, 2649 (65 percent) returned the survey. Of the respondents, 144 (5 percent) had received a total of 221 requests for prescriptions for lethal medications since October 1997. We received information on the outcome in 165 patients (complete information for 143 patients and partial for an additional 22). The mean age of the patients was 68 years; 76 percent had an estimated life expectancy of less than six months. Thirty-five percent requested a prescription from another physician. Twenty-nine patients (18 percent) received prescriptions, and 17 (10 percent) died from taking the prescribed medication. Twenty percent of the patients had symptoms of depression; none of these patients received a prescription for a lethal medication. In the case of 68 patients, including 11 who received prescriptions and 8 who died by taking the prescribed medication, the physician implemented at least one substantive palliative intervention, such as control of pain or other symptoms, referral to a hospice program, a consultation, or a trial of antidepressant medication. Forty-six percent of the patients for whom substantive interventions were made changed their minds about assisted suicide, as compared with 15 percent of those for whom no substantive interventions were made (P<0.001). \n \n Conclusions Our data indicate that in Oregon, physicians grant about 1 in 6 requests for a prescription for a lethal medication and that 1 in 10 requests actually results in suicide. Substantive palliative interventions lead some - but not all - patients to change their minds about assisted suicide.\n \n \n\n \n I would think substantive intervention would seem to be preferable to suicide. Another possible argument against.\n \n Huck",

I do challenge you to respond to the \"Dear Dr. Huck\".\n\n \n 1) I assume you are refering to the Dear Huck scenario with this item. However, you are clearly engaged in the hasty generalization fallacy. You make an affirmative statement, provide no evidence when asked except that you and others you know see it all the time. Sorry but you and others you know is hardly useful evidence. Biased for sure and also not examinable. Not objective, not even evidence. Since your argument is based on no evidence and I have provided evidence (even though you claim it is bad, you provide no support for your claim) I will claim victory on this point.\n \n 2) Thank you for stating it as your opinion. However, I have pointed out that the claims that he makes are OBJECTIVELY supported by the actual laws. Therefor, your feelings about him personally are irrelevant to the argument. His claim is that there is a lack of controls in place. The potential for abuse exists because of this. Since your only argument is that he is an idiot, in your opinion, and my argument is backed by facts, I will claim victory on this point.\n \n 3) You are correct that it does not specifically support or oppose the law and rather objectively reports its findings. However, you are wrong in that some of its findings do support my position. Clearly there is a better alternative given that giving alternative options people would likely change their minds. Those results are significant. Laws where there is no real investigative oversight and where physicians do not necessarily report all the info and where physicians are not REQUIRED to offer substantive support are not good. Given that society has historically viewed suicide as wrong (regardless of my personal belief mind you) this change in law without proper, objective, substantial, review and safeguard is highly dangerous. \n \n The problem is that no law CAN cover these things. It is inserting government into a realm that governments have not tread in many millenia. Bad bad bad bad legal precedent. I am opposed to these laws on this basis. Not because I necessarily oppose suicide. Apparently you don't like that someone who may have compassion for the person in pain can still say that such things are dangerous and should not be legal.\n \n 4) Since you are \"done\" (which I highly doubt), I will claim victory on this item and declare that such laws are bad for society. My response to the person who wishes to die would be something along the lines of, while I understand your hopelessness and your pain, I will gladly give you the necessary anesthetic to prevent the pain. I would even be willing to find a way to fund it so as not to cripple your family. I would like for you to see a counselor while you go through this and would suggest your family be involved. It would be good that your life end in its time. I have a friend with als WHO suffers much. However, even though he cannot move anything except his eyes, he has a profound impact on my life and the lives of those around him. He speaks into their life through words and other actions that he can initiate with a computer. Let me help you find a way to die with dignity. Suicide is not such a way.\n \n Now, Thelmoose, you will not like my response and likely will try to argue with it but you will lose. In fact you have already lost. You have nothing to support your position other than your own ad hom complaints and hasty generalizations.\n \n Huck",

Though I would therefore have to concede that is technically assisted suicide, it certainly has a more active role on the part of the doctor than self administration of meds at home. The machine thing is creepy to me, though I guess it is merely a subjective difference. I simply think it is a valid role of the physician to alleviate suffering. A dying person who desires suicidal relief is not an irrational act. I don't think it is immoral either. Certainly there are limits (I am likely going to die in 50 years or so, but that's not the same thing. The manner of death is unknown nor is it imminent) and the laws place limits on this. To the extent one does not think the extent of these limits are reasonable, this is, of course, debatable. My whole point here is that is has been tried in Oregon and seems to be successful to the extent it has been measured.\n \n Why does it pain you to concede a point? Aren't we here to simply communicate?\n \n Lastly, I also did not know the Amish used a different second person pronoun. Thanks for the education.",
