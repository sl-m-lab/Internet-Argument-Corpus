   "The man upgraded himself from taxi-driver to the politician with federal vision....to lose it all 'cause of his corrupted staffers! That's not fair. The employees of the German foreign affairs agency have established it as sort of lucrative business, giving visas and refugee status to people in money. Needless to say those are not always honest people. And now we are having the unprecedented rise in criminal activities originating with fishy foreigners coming from elsewhere. The police say the major headache is those proverbial Chechens. Police prompted the search in the Foreign agency to find out plenty of corrupted staffers there. Most surprising was that just at the height of this visa scandal our MPs raised the possibility of Chechen separatist strongman Zakaev visiting Germany. I saw this as blinder. Aren't they in the share? \n In the USA the Watergate-Scandal led to the creation of strict and binding ethnical code for members of Congress. Up till now, the major political scandals in here (the CDU party contribution scandal in 1999 e.g.) have had no similar effect. Isn't it time for Visagate in this country?",
