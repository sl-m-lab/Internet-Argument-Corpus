   "After the Vice Presidential debate, the DNC sent out emails to everyone who had signed up on Kerry's website urging them to flood the online and telephone polls to vote that Edwards had won the debate. They urged them to vote as many times as they could. This resulted in one poll showing 99% of pollsters claiming that Edwards won, and others with figures in the 80% range. This greatly contrasts all analysis I have seen on Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, etc.\n \n Being intuitive and curious, I decided to subscribe to the emails on Kerry's website to see for myself what actually goes on. I just got one that Mary Beth Cahill sent out to everyone on the list about tonight's debate. At the bottom it says, \"Remember to look for another e-mail after tonight's debate, giving you the insider's view on what really happened, and actions you can take that will help John Kerry win the post-debate spin.\"\n \n Will the DNC do anything they can to try and get Kerry elected? They assert that the Republicans are going to reinstate a draft (as far from the truth as you can get), they claim that Republicans are going to suppress the minority vote (absolutely ludicrous), and they then urge people to defraud the polling system to give a fairer outcome for their candidates' debate performances. Can they possibly stoop to a lower level?\n \n Now I have also subscribed to Bush's emails as well, and haven't even recieved an email today about the debate, nor any email urging Republicans to perform these fraudulent, misleading, and decieving acts.",

In addition, if anyone cares about a political poll, they'll look to an unbiased poll for their information, one that is known to be unbiased and reliable. Those polls choose scientific sampling populations rather than use the results of voters that \"call in\", that way you get a true cross section of popular opinion. Go read the article on Tom Delay, then come back and tell me how ethical politicians can be.",

I just don't see the relevance of the polls anyway, people will vote for the candidate that impressed them. Even if they fool the pollsters, the election will tell the true story. My take: they both conducted themselves pretty evenly, the Iraq war questions hurt Cheney just as they hurt Bush. As for declaring war on the Democrats, I'd be very cautious there, try to learn at least a little something from Iraq.",

The problem is the DNC top dogs urging them to do so. This is a blatant attempt by the DNC to try and influence public opinion after the debates. If people decide on their own to do so, it wouldn't be so bad because few people would do it. But when the DNC has millions of people on their mailing list and emails all of them, asking to commit this fraudulent act, this is taking it to another level. With these mass emails being sent out, you can bet that millions of Kerry supporters will flood some polls and definitely skew the results. Most intelligent and up-to-date people won't believe this. However, much of the undecided are looking for anything they can to get a better picture of each candidate. And what the DNC is trying to do is attract them by falsely portraying their candidate as the winner.",
