   "Uh, people, I hate to tell you this, but the story about Americans abusing the Koran in order to enrage prisoners has been out there for quite some time. The first mention I found of it is March 17, 2004, when the Independent of London interviewed the first British citizen released from Guantanamo Bay. The prisoner said he had been physically beaten but did not consider that as bad as the psychological torture, which he described extensively. Jamal al-Harith, a computer programmer from Manchester, said 70 percent of the inmates had gone on a hunger strike after a guard kicked a copy of the Koran. The strike was ended by force-feeding. \n \n Then came the report, widely covered in American media last December, by the International Red Cross concerning torture at Gitmo. I wrote at the time: \"In the name of Jesus Christ Almighty, why are people representing our government, paid by us, writing filth on the Korans of helpless prisoners? Is this American? Is this Christian? What are our moral values? Where are the clergymen on this? Speak up, speak out.\" \n \n The reports kept coming: Dec. 30, 2004, \"Released Moroccan Guantanamo Detainee Tells Islamist Paper of His Ordeal,\" reported the Financial Times. \"They watched you each time you went to the toilet; the American soldiers used to tear up copies of Koran and throw them in the toilet. ...\" said the released prisoner. \n \n ....\n \n So where does all this leave us? With a story that is not only true, but previously reported numerous times. So let's drop the \"Lynch Newsweek\" bull. Seventeen people have died in these riots. They didn't die because of anything Newsweek did -- the riots were caused by what our government has done. \n \n http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0517-34.htm",

   "Uh, people, I hate to tell you this, but the story about Americans abusing the Koran in order to enrage prisoners has been out there for quite some time. \n\n Hello again Maxwell. I've done battle with you before on another board. Just for yucks I'll let you try to guess who I am.\n \n The thing is, nothing that was done was illegal or in violation of any international law. It is a matter of conditioning prisoners and breaking them of their will so that they can be \"declawed\" so to speak. It is very similar (allbeit, more severe) to the way boot camp strips a recruit of his individuality so that he can be taught to function as a team player. There is nothing in the Geneva convention or any international law that says we even have to provide them with Korans in the first place. These terrorists need to be deprived of their pride and their will. Being that the biggest factor that is driving them is their warped version of the Islam religion, it only makes sense that our interrogators and captors use that as a weapon against them. When you are fighting an enemy that is driven by mass psychosis, your most valuable weapon is psychology. We are not interested in merely imprisoning terrorists the way we do with our common criminals. These people will not be rehabilitated by \"doing time.\" They will always be threat.\n \n Sure, there have been reports out already that point to the fact that this is happening, but when an outlet like Newsweek picks it up, it is like a huge megaphone broadcasting it load and clear all over the world. I don't remember any of those other reports resulting in mass riots and murder in several countries simulataneously across the globe, do you? So, it WAS the impact of the story that fanned the flame, not the act itself.\n \n Desecration of the Koran is punishable by death in most Muslim countries. But we don't play according to those rules, nor do we have to. The only ones who would be seriously impacted by the Newsweek article are the Muslims of the world. So what Newsweek is basically doing is picking up a huge megaphone, and blasting out loud and clear to the Muslim world; \"HEY, ALL YOU MUSLIMS! GUESS WHAT AMERICA IS DOING TO YOUR PRECIOUS KORAN???!! AMERICA IS SPITTING IN THE FACE OF YOUR RELIGION!\". But anyone with any common sense knows that this is not about America's disrespect for Islam. It is about dealing with captured terrorists. If a KKK member who terrorizes blacks decides that he is a Christian fundamentalist and that the bible defines his reason for being, I am sure that we would not hesitate to flush his bible down the crapper as well, especially if it would help reduce him to a level where he could be more easily interrogated in order to stop further violence.\n \n What really makes me mad though, is that Newsweek had to stoop to the level of Dan Rather and Jason Blair in order to achieve their goal of pointing the finger of blame at the U.S. military. I repeat; EVEN IF STUFF LIKE THIS IS HAPPENING, THERE IS NOTHING ILLEGAL, IMMORAL OR FATTENING ABOUT IT. And our own press does not need to be a mouth piece for the enemy.",

In fact your argument is a fallacy, a sort of poisoing the wells as well as changing th subject, which makes you guilty of two fallacies. Al-Jazeera's credibility is not what is in question here. Al-Jazeera is merely a example of a broad based reporting network which reported the incident long before newsweek did. The entire point of naming them was to refute your claim that no other mainstream media reported the story. \n \n \n\n You are so willing to believe our enemies while at the same time calling the U.S. a liar. But you are not anti-American, right?\n\n \n This is why you really aren't worth my time. One who cannot even remotely understand complexity is childish. The reason I'm inclined to believe this happened was because one, the Red cross and other humanitarian groups reported the same incident 10-11 months ago. Not to mention that british and Russian news did the same. And I can't forget that the story was run past two pentagon officials who did not have any problems with the koran in toliet part. Now, when a large number of respectable sources have reported it and given the story the OK, what does that tell you? Also, this isn't much of a change considering the tatics that have been used before that were clearly sacriligious to Islam. When the pattern has been set, and the specific incident has been recorded for a long time, what is there to say it was false? \n \n \n\n The difference is that Newsweek claimed that its story was confirmed by a ranking member of the pentagon and therefore an admission by the U.S. government.\n\n \n Hello, it was run past two officials that did not take any offense to the specific part.\n \n \n\n The last I heard, Muslims are still protected by our constitution. I see Muslim people all the time, they are just as free as the rest of us.\n\n \n So? doesn't mean they are treated like garbage. blacks were protected in the post civil war era but they were lynched, killed, raped, mutilated, etc, etc. Attacks aganist arabs and muslims skyrocketed after september 11. What the consitution says isn't revelant here. It is what the people say and how they act. Merely because they are protected doesn't mean that the people of the country can hold a specific group in disgust. That should be blantantly obvious. \n \n \n\n Saudi Arabia does not have religious freedom.\n\n \n So? That's not the point. Do you consider their actions immoral when it comes to executing people who spread christanity and burning bibles? \n Please, your use of fraud is showing. That's the third fallacy you have used so far.\n \n Why is it that instead of dealing with the issue you resort to fraud?",

That leaves something in the order of 6925 unsearchable. If you are going to make a stastical claim on less then 7% on the whole, that is by all means the fallacy of argument From Small Numbers.\n \n I'd love to see Sam say that 6.6% of my posts represent the whole. That's like saying this drop in the bucket represents the olympic sized pool.\n\n This is too easy Maxwell. Not only do you use these terms repeatedly (as if you get a real chuckle hearing yourself say it), but you highlight them so that they are about as subtle as an elephant in a bird bath.\n \n From your WS thread; \"Fallacious arguments & Staff members\" Wow, what an imaginative title on your part!\n \n I only had to go down 13 posts to get these, and I'm not going to waste my time trying to prove the obvious.\n \n I have edited them to fit.\n \n \n01-16-2005, 07:00 PM #1\n \"Will i get banned if I call and can prove that a moderator or guide has acted in a deliberately fraudulent manner in a debate?\"\n 01-16-2005, 07:10 PM #3 \n \"The only time I point fallacies out is when ...Meaning, the argument used could easily be a example of the fallacy as given sites such as...\n ...I expect ...honest debate, not outright fraud...\n 01-16-2005, 07:53 PM #5\n True, someone may use a fallacy unintentionally, but some of the fallacies used ....It becomes even more worrisome when certain members develop a tendency to resort, or base their arguments upon known fraud.\n 01-16-2005, 08:04 PM #7\n Well, as I see it, you guys were picked for a reason, and that reason seems to be in tune with deceptive reasoning...\n 01-16-2005, 08:33 PM #9 \n It's not necessarily a skill or style to know not to use fraud...In that sense, knowledge of fraud becomes a basic ethical standard,...

   "Okay, that doesn't prove you aren't using them.\n\n If I say Bush was right in going into Iraq, you would say that was \"fallacy.\" But it is a matter of opinion, because history has not yet been written. History judges these things according to the long term results, not the opinions of those in the \"here and now.\" \n \n \nUm, how does this prove you aren't using fallacies? \n\n I don't need to prove to you that I am right. I speak my mind, and I make an argument for my case. I BELIEVE that I am right, but when I am wrong I will admit it. Part of the reason that I like being on these boards is because you are forced to learn about what you talk about. The subject matter being discussed can be educational. But I do (and so do you) look at things from my own political perspective. This does not make either one of us right or wrong on issues that are debateble.\n \n \nYou're telling me that 6  posts represent 7475?  \n \n That percentage comes out to 8.2067558e-4%\n\n I am not trying to put a percentage on your use of adjectives. I am merely saying that in all the times I have discussed things with you, you always seem to throw out words like \"fallacy,\" and \"fraud\" just as you are doing right now. Am I being fallacious about that? Or is it the truth? I did not have to look very hard to find the examples I gave either.\n \n We could sit here and accuse each other of being fallacious all day long, but that does not make for a very constructive discussion.\n \n \nDo you realize that the thread has a specific point? Aka, discussing fraud usage within the staff? I had to make my point, hence why I used the language. that should be obvious?\n\n I don't care about the point of the thread. When you repeatedly use the same accusing words over and over, it makes you look like an intellectual dolt. And I'm not trying to be rude by saying that. You can get your point across in a more diplomatic way. You are never going to convince anyone of anything by shooting down everything that is said as being \"fallacious,\" or \"fraudulent.\" No one wants to debate someone like that.\n \n \nIf you don't want to talk to me, don't. But that doesn't mean I'm not going to keep highlighting your fraud.\n\n There you go again. I may have been a little short with you before, but what I said here on this post was a sincere critique of how you come across to others. I did not get on a board to preach to the choir, so I don't mind talking to you. But I'm not going to go back and forth with you about who's right and who's being fraudulent. You have to respect the fact that not everyone is going to agree with you, and that does not mean they are spewing \"fallacies.\"\n \n \nyour post doesn't prove that you aren't a fraud user.\n\n Maxwell, I don't care if you think I use fraud.

You've ignored key parts of my argument and then resorted to stupid things like 6 posts represent 7475!

The Dutch sent ships with disaster relief aid. Meanwhile, the Imams took to the pulpits of their Mosques and preached fire and brimstone sermons about how Allah had punished the Muslim population of the area for being too friendly with the \"infidel\" westerners. When the Dutch arrived in their ships, they were slaughtered by the hundreds at the hands of crazed zealots in 1888.\n http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1230/p01s04-woap.html\n Ripple effects of Indonesia's geological events\n Earlier natural disasters in the 'Ring of Fire' had global repercussions - and altered course of history.\n \n \n I guess we would have to ask, why did the Muslims hate the Dutch?",

   "Related to the actual event of 9/11? No. Related to the overall threat to our national security? Yes.\n \n \n Plese, take me down that slippery slope where a ME dictator with no WMDs, no delivery system, and was an enemy of AQ was a threat to the US.\n \n \n \nThe 911 commission report documents the fact that Al Qaeda was in contact with Saddam. Do we really have to rehash that?\n Show me your evidence of Saddam bombing Al Qaeda camps in Iraq. That's a new one. I thought the biggest liberal argument was that there were no Al Qaeda camps in Iraq?\n\n \n No. The 9/11 comission report said there MAY have been LIMITED interaction between Iraqi intelligence services and Al Queda members. Woudl you like to discuss interaction between the CIA and Al Queda members?\n \n \nSaddam may have denied having them to the U.N., but his actions told another story. He also threatened us with them when we invaded. He also kept playing a shell game with the inspectors. He never fully cooperated, and he kept moving materials from place to place. Also Iraq never signed the chemical weapons treaty. If Saddam wanted to back up his claim about not having them, he should have allowed the inspectors to do their job. They may have been inspecting sheds, but they were not allowed into the palaces, which were the focus of most of the attention;\n \"The access that we require must include the presidential palaces. It is no good allowing inspectors access to 99 percent of Iraq if the weapons of mass destruction are actually located and stored...in the remaining one percent,\" Tony Blair said. Oct. 3 2002\n\n \n \n Sorry, that is just a lie. The Un weapons inspectors never requersted access to the presidential palaces. That was all the US, and we did it becuase we wanted CIA agents in there. that was the big sticking point for inspections. we stacked the inspectors staff with intel agents who were not inspecting for weapons but instead just spying. Blix even filed a complain with the UN claiming that he could not get inspections done because his staff was so busy spyign to do any inspecting.\n \n Face it. The whole WMD thing was a farce from the start. Quit making stupid, rediculous excuses. Learn to stand up like a man and aadmit you were wrong.",
