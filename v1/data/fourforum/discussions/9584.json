   "Evolutionists have constructed a scientific philosophy based on a flawed premise. This premise is that each organism can be explained by its molecular composition - its parts. But molecules do not have the capacity to make a whole. And thus, life cannot be explained nor beneficially altered by the influx of random bits and pieces. In order for a part to be a constructive addition, it must be a modification ordered by the organism. So instead of studying the whole organism as a part of the larger web of life, Darwinists study the parts and ignore the fact that they're modified by other forces. They don't care to acknowledge that all parts not only have a reason for being, but also have a direct relationship with each other.\n \n What they also don't care to acknowledge is that even though genes may play role in dictating physical traits, they dictate nothing about the processes that would make those parts functional. Evolutionists would like to believe the heart came from some unknown random mutation, but where does the information or coding come from to make it beat? They want to claim that some weird mutation - or mutations -- ares responsible for the eyes, but what evolutionists want you to forget is that it it is not the eye that is doing the seeing.......electric signals coming from the cells in our eyes are transformed into an image in our brains. The brain then interprets the electrical signals coming to the visual center in of the brain. \n \n Lfe is not a noun, life is a verb...life is an action. But that's what makes them materialists..they're only interested in the physical because they don't believe there's a spiritual element driving the moving parts.\n \n But darwinist philosophy is grounded in this myth - and they have twisted reality into something it's not -- they believe that organisms have been constructed by the sum of their small, randomly-appearing parts - parts that got selected because they were lucky enough to appear at the right place at the right time - and then frozen by success. \n \n It's a creation scheme grounded in chaos. Its an intelligence builder grounded in non-intelligence. But this scheme is just that - a scheme. There is absolutely nothing scientific about it. To me, real science should not be based on a flimsy philosophy...it should be based on an interaction with nature. Life is a unity, and thus, it should be studied as a complete unit. \n \n If evolutionary science were to be reputable, and if they really interested learning how animals go about the process of change - or what the limits to change are -- they would do their business much in the same way a math student would solve an algebra or other mathematical equation. Here' s what I mean:\n \n If a teacher asked a student to solve a multiplication question, the student would probably write the numbers down on a piece of paper like this:\n \n 9594\n x 745\n ----------\n \n In other words, he would line up the two variables and work the problem. But see, darwinists don't do that. Instead, they just close the book, tell you an answer, and hope you buy it. They tell you the process of how the problem might be solved -- but they don't ever get around to actually working the problem. \n \n If we were to extrapolate this into evolutionary science we would realize that we have two variables. The first variable is the organism. The second variable is the environment. Even evolutionists admit these are the two main variables in the equation. So the most logical thing to do would be to line them up like a mathematical equation. On the top line you might have an organism, and on the line below you subject that organism to a new environment. Only then would the problem be solved. At the very least you could rule out alternative answers.\n \n But evolutionists have never operated this way. Ever. They've never experimented with the interaction of natural variables. And that's because they DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWER! So instead of attempting to solve the problem by the most obvious of ways, they divert attention. How is this accomplished? Instead of looking at the whole, they focus on abstract parts. They steer everyone's attention away from realty and make them look at something they can't see! Most people are not able to see what happens when a bacteria meets up with an antibiotic.....We can't see \"the fossil record\" or what may or may not be 10 feet under the ground......We can't see natural selection or random mutations or genes.....We can't see a lot of things - instead, we are subject to being told what the results of these things are by those who are highly biased and have a worldview to protect. \n \n And make no mistake, evolutionists bank on the hope that their theory is so unimaginably complicated, that the average person will not ask questions out of fear of appearing ignorant of the supposed facts. This is where they shine because they are masters at ridicule, laughing and scorning, scoffing and derision towards anyone presenting a novel or contrary opinion. The have fine-tuned the art of discrediting people who threaten the orthodox paradigm of mainstream science.\n \n So the circle goes round and round. The theory is propped up and protected, while the study of real life gets forgotten. Problems are not solved like a mathematical equation would be, they're solved by fancy words and conveluted philosophies, which with any luck, will not be questioned.",

You do admit that changes are small and evolved gradually -- correct?...otherwise natural selection would be undermined???? Please read the following and then tell me how these two systems evolved together slowly over time.....or please tell me how they just somehow popped together. Oh...and don't forget about all the other systems in the body that have to be in operation for these two systems to function correctly: \n \n The Requirements for Variation (Gould)\n \n SMALL IN EXTENT. If the variations that yielded evolutionary change were large -- producing new major features, or even new taxa in a single step then natural selection would not disappear as an evolutionary force. Selection would still function in an auxiliary and negative role as headsman -- to heap up the hecatomb of the unfit, permit new saltation to spread among organisms in subsequent generations, and eventually to take over the population. But Darwinism, as a theory of evolutionary change, would perish -- for selection would become both subsidiary and negative, and variation itself would emerge as the primary, and truly creative, force of evolution, the source of occasionally lucky saltation. For this reason, the quite properly, saltationist (or macromutational) theories have always been viewed as anti-Darwinian -- despite the protestations of de Vries ..., who tried to retain the Darwinian label for his continued support of selection as a negative force. The unthinking, knee-jerk response of many orthodox Darwinians whenever they hear the word \"rapid\" or the name \"Goldschmidt,\" testifies to the conceptual power of saltation as a cardinal danger to an entire theoretical edifice. (Gould 2002: 143) \n \n Darwin held firmly to the credo of small-scale variability as raw material because both poles of his great accomplishment required this proviso.... At the theoretical pole, natural selection can only operate in a creative manner if its cumulating force builds adaptation step by step from an isotropic pool of small-scale variability. If the primary source of evolutionary innovation must be sought in the occasional luck of fortuitous saltations, then internal forces of variation become the creative agents of change, and natural selection can only help to eliminate the unfit after the fit arise by some other process. \n \n Gradualism. Selection becomes creative only if it can impart direction to evolution by superintending the slow and steady accumulation of favored subsets from an isotropic pool of variation. If gradualism does not accompany this process of change, selection must relinquish this creative role and Darwinism then fails as a creative source of evolutionary novelty. If important new features, or entire new taxa, arise as large and discontinuous variations, then creativity lies in the production of the variation itself. Natural selection no longer causes evolution, and can only act as a headsman for the unfit, thus promoting changes that originated in other ways. Gradualism therefore becomes a logical consequence of the operation of natural selection in Darwin's creative mode. -- Gould, Stephen J. (2002) The Structure of Evolutionary Theory.

You do admit that changes are small and evolved gradually -- correct?...otherwise natural selection would be undermined???? Please read the following and then tell me how these two systems evolved together slowly over time.....\n \n \n \n \n Walking-fish:\n Instead of pasting a quote by Gould arguing against saltationism, you could find the answer to this question by reading up on comparative vertebrate anatomy and evo-devo. If you start from fish, you just have to adapt the swim bladder for air breathing. The circulatory system is already hooked up to the fishes swm bladder. The arterial supply comes from a branch of the 6th dorsal aortic arch and the venous drainage hooks up with the curvierian duct (where the 2 cardinal veins join). You can put those terms in your search engine and look them up yourself. The main idea is that mutations are selected for which accent and enlarge the vessels that connect to the swimm bladder when it becomes more important for respiration, as the Aortic arches (there are 6 of them) become rerouted for other purposes as the gills become less important in the fish/amphibian transition. In other words, natural selection favors changes in size, direction and shape of structures already in existence in order to create new structures. \n \n I'm not going to knock myself out right now trying to explain how survival favors changes in different organ systems that are geared for the same adaptation in a changing environment. It's also useless to try explaining to a creationist that transitional states don't have to be adapted to a totally new environment (such as land vs water). In my example, the transition from gills to lungs involved an adaptation to amphibious conditions where the transitional forms (ichthyostegids) could straddle two different habitats employing both lungs & gills. The change from a two chambered heart to a three chambered heart could have also been gradual, since the less efficient two chambered version would still work well enough to prevent suffocation. \n \n And if you wanted to go even further back than fish, you could trace the evolution of open circulatory systems into closed systems with vessels and the adaptation of thin membranes in contact with both the surrounding air/water and the circulating blood. And there you have it - a respiratoy system. A whole group of snails, called the pulmonates, evolved a whole new system of respiration using the membrane lining the mantle cavity with its rich blood supply for air breathing as a substitute for gills. And there you have it - the evolution of lungs in land dwelling snails. You see, any membrane in contact with the air with a rich supply of blood can evolve into lungs when an organism first takes to land from the water. \n \n Now back to Gould... If you were more familiar with what he really said, you would understand that he wrote a lot about exaptation - the reorientation of a structure for a totally new form & function than what it had previously. What was once a swim bladder or mantle cavity membrane, becomes a lung. What was once an Aortic arch becomes a pulmonary artery. What was once a fin becomes a limb. What was once a rib becomes exapted for securing the limb as part of the pectoral or pelvic girdle. Preexisteing structures can be reworked to perform new functions by changes in shape, size, direction or position. It's as simple as that. And all it takes is mutations culled by natural selection in a way that better adapts an organism to a changing environment. And every time there is a change in one system, there comes to be new selective pressures upon other systems in order to function better with the changing systems around them. It's all gradual, and it all involves structures already in existence, and nothing has to fall apart during the transition.",

I look at that and I ask, how could it not happen?\n \n What do you see when you look at it? Because it clearly isn't the same thing...\n\n \n **\n First, I do not see any reason to believe, as you apparently do, that not only absolutely anything can happen, but that everything must happen, given a \"large enough\" quantity of time, or space, or material, or energy, or randomness, or whatever. To me that is simply an appeal to what I have dubbed, \"The Magick of Great Big Numbers\", and is even more a superstition than it is a self-contradicting metaphysical proposition--that of infinite, unbounded possibility in a finite, rationally defined and limited, material universe.\n \n As for myself, I see first the appearance of life where there was no life, and second, the appearance of novel forms that were not predictable from the original forms.\n That entails getting past the notion that non-life and life are not qualitatively different states of existence, (as asserted by materialist ontology). If you (by which I mean, 'anyone', not you personally) cannot overcome that metaphysical assumption, then you cannot distinguish planet Earth from Venus or Jupiter, or from the sun, the moon, and the stars. Or a living organism from a dust storm or a lava flow or an acid rain storm. Which, in the end, leaves you with no explanation for why living things can do things that inanimate things, including dead organisms, simply cannot do.\n \n Having come to accept that there most definitely is a qualitative, and not simply a quantitative, distinction between 'life' and 'non-life', the fallacy of the, \"quantitative (wrt, 'bits of stuff'), states only\", premise buried in the materialist ontology, (which in turn gives rise to the superstition of \"The Magick of Great Big Numbers\", the, \"anything is possible, given a big enough number of instances\"), loses any appeal it might have had for a rational person.\n \n Which is why, as stated above, materialists refuse to accept that a/everything and anything is not possible, at least not in any rational reality., and b/that which is possible, is possible only when it conforms to a rational set of constraints. That is, that nothing, \"just happens, that's all\". Save only the movement from dynamic to inert (entropic degeneration), which seems to be an essential part of physical existence. Any physical thing that overcomes that tendency, even just temporarily, requires a rational explanation in terms of cause and effect, and no simple appeal to \"The Magick of Great Big Numbers\" satisfies that requirement. \n \n So, for me, having all the 'right (bits of) stuff', i.e., to the degree that the physical requirements described in the 'strong anthropic principle' are satified, is simply a _necessary_ prerequisite to the appearance of biosystems, but it is not a _sufficient_ one. Some external actor is required. As an analogy, for what it's worth, blending ingedients in a bowl does not make a cake--it takes an oven to do that.

   "\n Phil S:\n First of all, your assertion that materialist explanations can only deal with the quantitive, and not the qualitative, differences between life & nonlife ignores the whole concept of emergence, which is a big part of modern biology.\n\n \n **\n And just what is this concept of 'emergence', other than a buzz-word concocted to label phenomena that materialism cannot explain? Basically it, along with random chance, is a variation on the theme of 'spontaneous generation'. That is, the irrational notion that something can be generated out of something that does not possess it, by that which does not possess it, unaided by anything else acting as any kind of catalyst. Creatio ex nihilo. \n \n The best thing that materialists, (who, after all, are reductionists and mechanists, and therefore, determinists to the man), can say is that sometime systems of bits of stuff, when placed in conjunction to and with each other, self-organize themselves and self-generate properties as a whole which none of the original constituent parts possess. This is an observation of a phenomenon, a description of it, and certainly not an explanation for it. From simply combining sodium and chlorine to make salt, all the way up to the psychical properties of life, it flies in the face of the determinist, reductionist, mechanist, materialist metaphysic. They simply cannot explain it from their understanding of reality, (i.e., as no more than bits of stuff in motion), so they give it a label, 'emergence', and hand-wave it away as just more 'spontaneous generation'.\n \n \n\n The difference between the relationship of the parts in a complex system and the properties those bits & pieces possess in isolation from eachother is a major qualitative leap.\n\n \n **\n Yes, it is. Any body can see that. But according to the materialist metaphysic, it should not be a qualitative difference. The properties of any conglomeration, set, or system, according to a materialist, reductionist, determinist ontology, should never exceed the sum of the properties of each member of that set, system, whatever, combined. But they do. The only \"explanation\" a materialist can give for this fact is 'spontaneous generation', a fancy modern expression for 'ye olde magick'. So, what's your point? \n \n \n\n Secondly, you haven't shown how some external factor is required.\n\n \n **\n Yes I have. Ex nihilo, nihil fit. See above.\n \n \n\n Your analogy with the cake ingredients does not take into consideration how molecules react with eachother in the organic world. Carbon based molecules in an aqueous medium can't help but form complex relationships with one another. \n\n \n **\n I never meant my simple analogy to be taken all that seriously. Also, observing such phenomena is not explaining them. And lastly, the relationships are not the issue--the 'emergent properties' that a whole has that its parts do not possess in se, are the issue.\n \n \n\n Self assembly is the name of the game when it comes to organic/biochemistry. \n\n \n **\n Indeed it is. But try to explain the properties of complex biosystems, in terms of self-assembly, self-maintenance, self-direction, and self-control, without refering to values, motives, volition, awareness, and goals. That is, explain such things from the materialist perspective.\n \n \n\n The nucleotides which are so essential for RNA & DNA are also a natural part of the cell's cytoplasm, forming such important molecules as ATP & NAD.\n\n \n **\n They may be 'natural', in the sense that they are there, after all, but why are they natural? That is, why are they there at all? Again, what's your point?\n \n \n\n How could you possibly tell what is possible and what is, or is not, sufficient here? \n\n \n **\n Simply from the first principle that nothing is more than it is, and nothing can be more or less than it is, and nothing can become different from what it is, without something else acting as a catalyst. Find the catalyst for emergence and you've explained it.\n \n \n\n You call upon a vital principle, which you cannot identify, to explain living processes before you have proven that the laws of nature are insufficient.\n\n \n **\n I do not know what you mean by, \"identify\". I've identified a psychical force called Vitality as acting as the catalyst in observed instances of biological emergence from material systems, from genesis to evolution to human consciousness. That's as good as identifying a physical force called Gravity in observed instances of fruit falling out of trees.",

   "Evolutionists have constructed a scientific philosophy based on a flawed premise. This premise is that each organism can be explained by its molecular composition - its parts. But molecules do not have the capacity to make a whole. And thus, life cannot be explained nor beneficially altered by the influx of random bits and pieces. In order for a part to be a constructive addition, it must be a modification ordered by the organism. So instead of studying the whole organism as a part of the larger web of life, Darwinists study the parts and ignore the fact that they're modified by other forces. They don't care to acknowledge that all parts not only have a reason for being, but also have a direct relationship with each other.\n \n What they also don't care to acknowledge is that even though genes may play role in dictating physical traits, they dictate nothing about the processes that would make those parts functional. Evolutionists would like to believe the heart came from some unknown random mutation, but where does the information or coding come from to make it beat? They want to claim that some weird mutation - or mutations -- ares responsible for the eyes, but what evolutionists want you to forget is that it it is not the eye that is doing the seeing.......electric signals coming from the cells in our eyes are transformed into an image in our brains. The brain then interprets the electrical signals coming to the visual center in of the brain. \n \n Lfe is not a noun, life is a verb...life is an action. But that's what makes them materialists..they're only interested in the physical because they don't believe there's a spiritual element driving the moving parts.\n \n But darwinist philosophy is grounded in this myth - and they have twisted reality into something it's not -- they believe that organisms have been constructed by the sum of their small, randomly-appearing parts - parts that got selected because they were lucky enough to appear at the right place at the right time - and then frozen by success. \n \n It's a creation scheme grounded in chaos. Its an intelligence builder grounded in non-intelligence. But this scheme is just that - a scheme. There is absolutely nothing scientific about it. To me, real science should not be based on a flimsy philosophy...it should be based on an interaction with nature. Life is a unity, and thus, it should be studied as a complete unit. \n \n If evolutionary science were to be reputable, and if they really interested learning how animals go about the process of change - or what the limits to change are -- they would do their business much in the same way a math student would solve an algebra or other mathematical equation. Here' s what I mean:\n \n If a teacher asked a student to solve a multiplication question, the student would probably write the numbers down on a piece of paper like this:\n \n 9594\n x 745\n ----------\n \n In other words, he would line up the two variables and work the problem. But see, darwinists don't do that. Instead, they just close the book, tell you an answer, and hope you buy it. They tell you the process of how the problem might be solved -- but they don't ever get around to actually working the problem. \n \n If we were to extrapolate this into evolutionary science we would realize that we have two variables. The first variable is the organism. The second variable is the environment. Even evolutionists admit these are the two main variables in the equation. So the most logical thing to do would be to line them up like a mathematical equation. On the top line you might have an organism, and on the line below you subject that organism to a new environment. Only then would the problem be solved. At the very least you could rule out alternative answers.\n \n But evolutionists have never operated this way. Ever. They've never experimented with the interaction of natural variables. And that's because they DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWER! So instead of attempting to solve the problem by the most obvious of ways, they divert attention. How is this accomplished? Instead of looking at the whole, they focus on abstract parts. They steer everyone's attention away from realty and make them look at something they can't see! Most people are not able to see what happens when a bacteria meets up with an antibiotic.....We can't see \"the fossil record\" or what may or may not be 10 feet under the ground......We can't see natural selection or random mutations or genes.....We can't see a lot of things - instead, we are subject to being told what the results of these things are by those who are highly biased and have a worldview to protect. \n \n And make no mistake, evolutionists bank on the hope that their theory is so unimaginably complicated, that the average person will not ask questions out of fear of appearing ignorant of the supposed facts. This is where they shine because they are masters at ridicule, laughing and scorning, scoffing and derision towards anyone presenting a novel or contrary opinion. The have fine-tuned the art of discrediting people who threaten the orthodox paradigm of mainstream science.\n \n So the circle goes round and round. The theory is propped up and protected, while the study of real life gets forgotten. Problems are not solved like a mathematical equation would be, they're solved by fancy words and conveluted philosophies, which with any luck, will not be questioned.\n\n \n *stares at for a second, rolls eyes, then walks away embarrassed*",

This is called, 'emergence', but it is no more emergence than saying that you can have the word, 'rasp' and the word 'gin', two individual words with different semantic properties, and by combining their 'parts' to spell 'sparing', a third word with its own distinct semantic properties. The fact is that 'sparing' does not 'emerge' out of 'rasp' and 'gin'. but rather all three arise out of a symbolic language code, the alphabet.

The name of the game is to move the goal posts to a level just beyond what our empirical methods have uncovered. And when the origin of all the proteins that make up the bacterial flagellum is finally fully understood, our attention can be diverted to some other complex system to take its place. As long as there is a mystery, or gap, or unexplained phenomenon, there is always an opportunity to insert a vital force, or intelligent designer or \"God of the gaps\". \n \n The rationale is always the same. Claim that natural, or material or unintelligent or undirected mechanisms cannot account for something, and then announce that there is a ghost in the machine. Just make sure that your ghost is safely out of reach. Ever since Wohler synthesized urea in 1828 vitalists have had to move their ghost further out of reach with each new discovery in molecular & cell biology. I believe that there will always be that which is beyond our ability to know, and I believe that the distinction between the \"material\" and \"nonmaterial\" world is meaningless. What you call vital is no more than a potential that is inherent in all matter.\n \n The ultimate reality, I believe, is way beyond what we can ever discover by empirical methods anyway, and it's useless to insert philosophical musings about some intangible intelligence or consciousness or vital force into a scientific theory. Some things, like why there is a universe to begin with, or why we are conscious of our existence in the world, are unkowable and unaccessible to empirical science; and it's much better to admit that we don't know than to invent some psuedoscientific jargon about intelligent designers or vital forces to explain such thngs.",
