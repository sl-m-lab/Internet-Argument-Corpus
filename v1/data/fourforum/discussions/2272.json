   "Now, before everyone crucifies me for speaking such blasphemy, let me explain. The newer seasons of the Simpsons are mostly garbage. They rely on their new hip writers that have been directing the course of the show for at least 3-4 seasons now (Matt Groening has since left the show), and the new stuff is no where near as funny. It relies on mostly topical humor, ex. Murphy Brown (refer to Family Guy 2ACX07 for this joke), which as we all know is completely useless on The Simpsons because it takes them at least 6 months to complete one episode. The old seasons (1-10 about) need to be cherished and not tarnished by the trash that they air on Fox now. It's been 15 seasons now, its time for the Simpsons to stop, for everyone's sake. And if they stop making new ones, they'll leave more of the old ones to syndication on the WB or some other channel. This will also allow more of the spotlight to be put on the best animation of the new generation (Family Guy, South Park, and Futurama). So love the Simpsons and do the right thing, don't watch the new eps on Fox. By the way, new Family Guy is rumored to air in the Fall on Cartoon Network as well as new Futurama some time later.",

   "If I were a Simpsons viewer I would not simply stop watching them just because you want me to. However I've probably only caught about 3 full Sunday episodes in the last 5 years. It has gone way down hill in my opinion and there just isn't anything special about the show anymore. It is the same junk that is one every other cartoon you listed.",
