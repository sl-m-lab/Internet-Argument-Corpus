   "Indeed it is looking for help. Check out the mission statement of the Canadian Muslim Congress, if you are this religion, and want to join--\n \n \nAs Muslims we believe in a progressive, liberal, pluralistic, democratic, and secular society where everyone has the freedom of religion. We want our communities to be equal and active contributors and participants in the development of a just, democratic, and equitable society in Canada.\n \n We believe in the separation of religion and state in all matters of public policy. We feel such a separation is a necessary pre-requisite to building democratic societies, where religious, ethnic, and racial minorities are accepted as equal citizens enjoying full dignity and human rights enunciated in the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \n We believe that fanaticism and extremism within the Muslim community is a major challenge to all of us. We stand opposed to the extremists and will present the more humane and tolerant face of our community. \n We oppose gender apartheid that is practiced in parts of our community, and believe it is contrary to the equity among men and women enshrined in Islam. We believe that Muslim men and women should work together, shoulder-to-shoulder, in their effort to rejuvenate our community. \n We envision Canada as a society with strong and well-funded public institutions in the health, education and social services sectors. We feel these public institutions are the foundation and pre-requisite for an enterprising and vibrant private sector. \n We will work for a more progressive, anti-racist and accessible immigration policy in Canada; a policy that recognizes the contributions of immigrants as vital assets of society and essential for the survival of the country. \n We hope to build a Canada where personal initiative and creativity are celebrated and rewarded, but not at the cost of our collective social conscience and an abandonment of our responsibility towards the broader community. \n We look forward to building communities free from the ravages of racism, intolerance, ignorance, disease, and poverty, and where religion becomes a force of joy, enlightenment, democracy, peace and bridge-building, rather than hate, oppression, war and division. \n We support the aspirations and dreams of the peoples of the developing countries throughout the world.; a dream of dignity, democracy, freedom from poverty and political oppression, and a just and lasting peace. To achieve this and resist the steady re-colonization of the developing world, we will work closely with like-minded groups in building an anti-imperialist movement. \n We recognize the reality of globalization, but are concerned at its domination by transnational corporations at the expense of ordinary citizens. We hope to work closely with international movements to build on the positive aspects of globalization while opposing corporate globalization, which undermines sovereign democratic governments.\n\n \n The Muslim Canadian Congress mission",

You're reward? Among other things; 72 Virgins!\n \n Let's subject that to even a basic thought process, shall we?\n \n 72 Virgins? I agree Matt. Who has the time or the want to teach 72 young inexperienced women all they might need to know? Some percentage will turn out to be gay and have no use for you,... I'm guessing that even in Allah-land (heaven?) one would live for an eternity,... right? So, let's see... even if your were conservative and took only one virgin per what? Let's say every 700 THOUSAND YEARS? EXCUSE ME? Sound like Heaven to you?\n \n Ok, say you are marathon man and take all 72 in three days! Now you have 72 NON virgin women with all the conversations and unions they can for for and against you... bickering, comparing etc. 72 women that are going to want to be satisfied in more ways than just sexually.... And WAIT!\n \n What did each of these 72 virgins to deserve this as THEIR eternity? Guess what girlie,... here's your future.... you get to share the rest of your eternal life with this XXXXX who blew his own azz up.... with 71 other 'virgin' girlies.... and you best not say one damn negative thing about it!\n \n The realizations go on and on and on the more you think about it. I'm sure that i haven't even scratched the surface.\n \n :xbanghead",
