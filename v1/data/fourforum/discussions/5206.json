   "Lawmaker Behind Texas Gay Foster Parent Bill Says God Made Him Do It \n by 365Gay.com Newscenter Staff\n \n Posted: May 14, 2005 12:01 am ET \n \n (Austin, Texas) The Texas lawmaker behind a bill that would ban gays and lesbians from being foster parents in the state says he was called on by God.\n \n The measure has passed the House and is awaiting a vote in the Senate.\n \n Rep. Robert Talton (R-Pasadena) made his assertion in a letter he gave to state Sen. Jane Nelson (R-Lewisville) after she criticized the legislation\n \n The Dallas Morning News obtained details of the letter from two other legislators. Neither Talton nor Nelson would discuss its contents with the paper.\n \n One of the legislators, Sen. Jon Lindsay (R-Houston), told the News that he was shown the two-page letter. According to Lindsay Talton spoke of a religious mission to hold conservatives, including Nelson, accountable. Talton also cited several Bible passages to support his opposition to homosexuality, Lindsay said.\n \n The second lawmaker, who spoke to the paper only on the condition of anonymity confirmed the contents of the letter.\n \n Talton refused an interview with the Morning News and has resisted an open records request by the paper for the letter. An attorney for Talton said that the lawmaker believes he should not have to disclose the letter. \n \n But, an attorney for The News said the Public Information Act allows no exception to its disclosure requirements for such letters.\n \n Talton has been working to ban gay foster parents for the past two years. \n \n \"I don't think it is right for young children to be exposed to this type of behavior when they are young and innocent,\" Talton said during debate on the legislation last month. (story) \n \n \"It is our responsibility to make sure that we protect our most vulnerable children and I don't think we are doing that if we allow a foster parent that is homosexual or bisexual.\"\n \n The amendment requires the Texas Department of Child Protective Services add a question to its forms for prospective foster parents inquiring whether the person is gay.\n \n If the person answered yes they would be automatically disqualified. \n \n The legislation also requires the state to remove foster children already placed in the homes of gays or lesbians.\n \n \u00a9365Gay.com 2005",
