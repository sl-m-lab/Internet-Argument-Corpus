   "There seem to be a growing number of fundamental particles that make up all of the matter and radiation that was once thought to be made up of only protons, neutrons, electrons, and photons. Is there a table similar to the piriodoc table of the elements that lists these 40 or more particles? What I know so far is that there are 2 basic types of fundamental particles. Fermions, wich are the 6 quarks, and leptons, wich are composed of the 3 neutrinos, and the electron, muon, and tauon. And Bosons, wich are the 8 gluons that mediate the strong nuclear force, the 3 weak guage bosons w- w+ and z0 wich mediate the weak nuclear force, and the photon that mediates the electromagnetic force.",

There are 3 diagrams, however, which are useful for relating the particles in terms of their quark content. Take a look at this page:\n http://www.shef.ac.uk/physics/teaching/phy304/propquark.html",
