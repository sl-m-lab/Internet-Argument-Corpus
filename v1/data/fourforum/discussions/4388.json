   "WASHINGTON -- February 24 --The National Religious Leadership Roundtable today rejected Pope John Paul II's statement in his recently-published book calling equal civil marriage rights for same-sex couples \"part of a new ideology of evil.\"\n \n \"We share with the rest of the world concerns for the Pope's health in light of his recent illness, and pray for his strength and wholeness. But we cannot be silent when he questions the human dignity of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people,\" said Bob Gibeling* on behalf of the National Religious Leadership Roundtable.\n \n \"As the Pope's fellow clergy and religious leaders, we strongly disagree with the Pope's statement that protecting the rights of gay people, 'attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man,'\" Gibeling continued, \"We call on him to remember that the essence of the Christian faith and all religious tradition is the continued empowerment of the poor, the outcast and the marginalized. We believe that greater recognition of the inherent value of gay and lesbian families through equal rights can only lead to strengthening of the family and humankind.\"\n \n Gibeling added, \"As people of faith, we call on the Pope to pray and consider the devastating results of his statements to millions of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Christians. We challenge all religious leaders to contemplate the reality that history and the Creator have brought the world to a place of understanding that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people are a necessary component of the human family.\"\n \n National Religious Leadership Roundtable member Sam Sinnett, President of Dignity USA further commented, \"One cannot properly teach morality on homosexuality if one excludes the vast body of medical and social science knowledge that shows it is a normal part of the great diversity of God's creation and if one excludes the lived experience of same-sex couples experiencing love and intimacy in the families they form,\" Sinnett called on the Pope and other Roman Catholic leaders to, \"properly form their consciences and abandon their misguided attempts to equate homosexuality and same-gender marriage with evil.\"\n \n \"If same-sex marriage qualifies as part of 'a new ideology of evil,' then the world is in far better shape than I thought,\" said Catholic theologian and National Religious Leadership Roundtable member Mary Hunt, Co-director of Women's Alliance for Theology, Ethics and Ritual (WATER). \"Marriage, whether in a same-sex or opposite-sex context, is a celebration of love and commitment, fidelity and family, and all desirable aspects of common life. Poverty, greed, war, and ecological destruction would better fit the Pope's category of 'evil' and be more worthy of his scrutiny. In a world full of such evil, the power of same-sex love is a refreshing antidote.\"\nhttp://www.commondreams.org/news2005/0224-12.htm",

You feel that the actions of others an evil, but I believe the actions of those who oppose gay rights are the only real evil here.

I don't think that's asking too much.\n \n \nFirst of all, I can't think of a single religious group whose history is not marred by one, if not more, periods of violence perpetrated against non-believers or even its own adherents.

Religion in a vacuum can do nothing--violence is most often perpetrated in cases where people already WANT to commit violence, and religion is used as an excuse. For the popes, it was often a desire for power, not their religion, that motivated them to do many of the things they did. There is nothing in the Bible to indicate they should have done the inquisitions or the crusades for instance. And I think it is more accurate to say that many past abuses were not so much a result of religion itself, but the odd and dangerous mix of religion and government (remember, kings bowed to popes at one time).\n \n Furthermore, I don't think anyone here is not acknowledging that harm has been done by religious people in the past--there's certainly little danger of anyone not hearing it as long as people such as yourself are around who obviously take pleasure in pointing it out.

   "I'm saying 'who are you' to tell any religious group that their religion is not?' You're the one slapping them in the face, not me.\n\n \n First of all, I don't go around telling individual believers that their particular religion is not divinely inspired. Now, if they asked me, of course I would say so, because IT'S TRUE, and I would attempt to show them why I thought that. Even if they remained unconvinced that THEIR religion was a human construct, clearly they would agree with me that all others were (and only theirs was inspired). \n \n If you're suggesting that all religion is divinely inspired, well, I think that's silly. Plus, I believe your own religion would consider that heretical, no?\n \n At worst I end up with a 99.99% accuracy rate. Not bad, eh?\n \n \nAnd I actually thought you were being nice [by using my real screename, as I asked nicely]! I obviously gave you waay too much credit.\n\n \n What would be nice is if you would acknowledge that sexual orientation isn't about \"actions\". You apparently take great offense at the suggestion that YOURS isn't.\n \n In any case, I've stopped \"non-heterosexual\"izing your name because you ran to the admin and said I was \"calling you names\" and got me banned. Now, I don't see that what I was doing really qualified as \"calling you names\", but it's their forum, so I'll do as they ask. I told them so, and they reinstated me.\n \n \nWell, lets see--historical icons which happen to be religious in content are rapidly being removed from govt. buildings (ten commandment statues),\n\n \n The only one I'm aware of is Judge Moore's, down in Alabama. I'm not sure how \"historical\" something is when it's only a few months old. It was removed for the very reason that he put it up: because he was trying to make the point (his point) that this is a Christian nation. \n \n \nthere has been a concerted effort to wipe out general terms (\"God\") from the pledge of allegiance, \n\n \n It shouldn't have been put there by Christian zealots in the 50s. Again, a relatively recent attempt to move to a religious perference when none existed previously.\n \n \nany govt. work to help charities with any ties whatsoever to religious groups is under attack, \n\n \n Another mischaracterization. Government money has always flowed to religious charities, IF they were willing to follow the rules. Now, your side is trying to change the rules and, as a result, government funds are now being misused to build church facilities and I, as a gay man, will soon be subject to employment discrimination.\n \n \nand teachers are now barred from exercising their faith in the classroom (school prayer). \n\n \n I hope you're just putting this one badly. The recitation of Christian prayers in a public school, led by a teacher or authorized student, though once allowed, are an abridgement of the rights of non-Christian students. It was wrong then and it's wrong now. What worked when the country was 95% Christian isn't going to work anymore.\n \n \nWhat did you say was deteriorating?\n\n \n Honesty and ethical behavior on your side's part.",

WE need to learn to disagree without being disagreeable.\n\n \n Is it any more disagreeable to get someone banned without warning or even a request to stop? Certainly that does not help anyone exchange ideas. And what of Jyoshu, did you ask whether he was offended, first? I can say that if someone was insulting me during a debate, I would probably still want to continue that debate; I'd probably be very unhappy if someone else got that person banned. I come to these forums to debate, to change minds, and I can't do that when the person I'm talking to gets banned.\n \n And it may seem strange, but many people on many forums find it more entertaining to engage in debates where insults are present, and I have seen every regular on these forums insult his or her opponent at least once. I'm no fan of insults but this is debating, and it's a topic that involves a lot of sensitive material, especially to gay people who are regularly called sinners, bad parents, a drain on society, and every other illogical name one can think of. I'm no fan of insults, but they are to be expected; they probably can't be avoided. What Bob did wasn't even very bad. I don't mean to single you out, but it's inappropriate to ban someone without warning like that for such a harmless insult. Bob is clearly here to engage in constructive discussion. We need people like that; we don't need them banned.",

   "You seem to have this idea that religion itself caused these times of violence. Religion in a vacuum can do nothing--violence is most often perpetrated in cases where people already WANT to commit violence, and religion is used as an excuse. For the popes, it was often a desire for power, not their religion, that motivated them to do many of the things they did. There is nothing in the Bible to indicate they should have done the inquisitions or the crusades for instance. And I think it is more accurate to say that many past abuses were not so much a result of religion itself, but the odd and dangerous mix of religion and government (remember, kings bowed to popes at one time).\n\n \n religion is used as an excuse. \n \n Is that not what you are doing?",
