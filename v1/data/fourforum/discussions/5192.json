   "Comments? Is this something that Canadians are concerned about?\n ============================\n \n Canada fears new generation of terrorists\n \n By Shaun Waterman\n UPI Homeland and National Security Editor\n \n Washington, DC, May. 12 (UPI) -- Two declassified reports from Canadian intelligence say a generation of young jihadists with Canadian nationality or residency who have been through terrorist training camps in Afghanistan or elsewhere constitute \"a clear and present danger to Canada and its allies,\" highlighting fears that the United States' northern neighbor might become a staging post for terror attacks here.\n \n \"The presence of young, committed jihadists in Canada is a matter of grave concern,\" states one report, titled \"Sons of the Father: The next generation of Islamic extremists in Canada.\"\n \n \"They represent a clear and present danger to Canada and its allies and are a particularly valuable resource for the international Islamic terrorist community in view of their language skills and familiarity with Western culture and infrastructure,\" the report goes on.\n \n Barbara Campion, spokeswoman for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, told United Press International that the situation was \"alarming because (in many cases) these are people who don't have any obvious pedigree in extremism or connection to terrorist groups.\"...\n \n (snip)\n \n The other declassified report, titled, \"Al-Qaida attack planning against North American targets,\" says Canada is high on the list of the terror group's targets because of its presence in Afghanistan. The nation was listed the fifth most important target by al-Qaida in March 2004, \"behind the United States, Britain, Spain and Australia.\"\n \n \"Canada is the only country listed above which has thus far not been directly attacked by al-Qaida,\" the report notes ominously...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20050512-075511-9678r.htm",

   "I can honestly say that no, it doesn't alarm me.\n \n I'm sure you'll be shocked by that. :p \n \n I don't doubt that there are a few \"trained jihadists\" in Canada, I don't doubt there are a few \"trained jihadists\" in just about every country in the world. In fact I'd be willing to bet that outside the middle east, the greatest number of \"trained jihadists\" reside in the USA. If anyone doesn't agree with that, IMHO, they are simply naive to reality.\n \n I do think we need to take every reasonable precaution, but I'm a realist, and the simple fact of the matter is NOTHING that we can do will prevent this kind of activity from going on. This is a prime example of why - \"alarming because (in many cases) these are people who don't have any obvious pedigree in extremism or connection to terrorist groups.\"...\n \n Terrorism is like bacteria, you can't kill it because it's tough, it's really hard to see, and it's constantly evolving. \n \n Waxy\n \n P.S. I don't think Canada is on Al Qaeda's hit list any time soon, if ever.",

   "I would say no, Canadians are not in general concerned about it. Besides the report came CSIS who I put on the bottom of the list for respect of intelligence agencies.\n \n That we have some muslim extremists in Canada I dont doubt, but because Canada is more of a safe haven for them I doubt they will attack normal Canadians.\n \n If they want to thin out the political herd, I would in general thank them. We have way to many proffesional politicians that need culling",
