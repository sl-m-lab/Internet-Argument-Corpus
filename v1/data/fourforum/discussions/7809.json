It may not treat 16 year olds differently based on things like race or ethnic origin, it must treat all of them equally within IT'S jurisdiction because of the \"equal protection\" clause.

   "Did you happen to see if the words \"privacy\" or \"abortion\" appear on it?...they could be on the back.\n\n \n Heh, good point--no those words aren't there. I agree with you about abortion, though I'm not sure the fact it's not in the constitution is any compelling reason, alone, to legalize it. If laws were ONLY based on what is expressly written out, everything from murder ot money laundering would be legal. \n \n I think the real issue here is what we mean by \"living constitution.\" To me, that doesn't mean a document that can be interpreted on a whim, any way that fits the times. If that were true, then we could possibly imagine scenarios where murder WOULD be legal if society suddenly started to care less about people's lives. Although in the real world, public opinion ALWAYS does affect constitutional interpretation over time, regardless of whether or not it should. A living constitution, IMO, is one that can change. By amendments.\n \n My belief is that in the end, public opinion probably has a far greater effect on things than individual judges. Sure, judges have an enormous amount of power (particularly when they interpret the constitution loosely), but public opinion shapes the culture that ultimately gets them appointed. If a case doesn't have a lot of public opinion controversy, there seems to be less chance that SCOTUS will even take up the case. We elect those presidents that appoint those judges, and we do it based on our support or lack thereof of the issues they support. When it's all said and done, I think it's still a govt. by the people and for the people. But yeah, judges can certainly misuse their power.",
