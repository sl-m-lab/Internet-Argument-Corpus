   "I would have to agree, I dont think arming passengers is the best option in that kind of enviroment, if this were a train I would say sure but it is an Airplane, Sky Marshals and Pilots are enough for me in that enviroment.\n\n \n Are you worried about bullet holes? Not to worry. In the cockpit overhead of 747s there is a \"sunroof\". Under desperate conditions when all electronic navagation fails, the crew opens the \"sun roof\" and sticks a stellar navagation tool out the hole. Sometimes when they really need a cigaratte they blow the smoke out the hole. Not to worry about the bullet holes.\n \n What about the windows? Yes a bullet throw a window will cause the whole window to fail and a relative fast decompression. Don't believe the movies. The skin is not about to tear way and people sucked out the hole.",
