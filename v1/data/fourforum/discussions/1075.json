   "I remember my sex ed classes, they weren't that long ago, I'm 21 now, so it was just a few years back when i last had one in grade 9. I recall nothing stated ever about abstinence, not once, and all us guys thought about was wanting to get laid, there was nothing trying to influence us otherwise. It almost seemed like a competition to not be the last one to get laid. We did learn about protective sex, but as it turns out, many really didn't care anyways and I've had girls try to refuse using a condom because they say \"it hurts\". The last time that happened, I refused sex. I do agree that teens are reaching sexual maturity at an earlier age than ever, some of this is attributed to better nutrition in todays society. But these teens still have the same emotional responsibility of teens at the same age a generation or two ago. They're still just as ready for it psychologically as they were then, the only difference is their hormones are driving them to want it more. As a teen i was quite confused by my moral belief that i should wait but my teen \"horn-dog\" nature that wanted to do it now and then. And of course when the popular TV shows consisted of \"Friends\" where a bunch of people in there 20s talked about having sex or \"Dawson's Creek\" where teens sneak into their bf/gf's bedrooms at night.

To summarize he/she said that your shouldn't get pregnant and if you do - you just get to deal with it. There is absolutely no regard for an individual's situation, the attack is entirely focused on women and it offers NOTHING that will help reduce abortion.\n \n ROCC's statement was quite woman-hating, but no, it is not indicative of the pro-life side's feelings about women. The only times I am compelled to really think pro-lifers are anti-woman is when they have the \"pregnancy is a woman's due punishment for promiscuity\" attitude or demand that a woman die/put her health jeapardy or demand rape victims go through with pregnancies. If you can't see the woman in even those most extreme situations, then you clearly have zero regard for women.\n \n I believe that abortion stands it best chance at being reduced by addressing the things that lead to unplanned pregnancy and the reasons women choose to abort. To demonize women and simply take away choice without addressing these things will not reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, or gauarantee responsible choices.

I have no problem with him knowing about it. But then I have never been a strong supporter of sanitizing the world. There are age-appropriate things, I agree, but if my son asks me a question I will answer it. \n \n Nor do I care for the inference that I am an irresponsible parent because I don't keep my kid in Disneyland. I didn't leave the condoms laying around, they were put away, he found them digging through stuff he shouldn't have been. Feel free to lie to your kids. I won't. Plus he is smart, he would not have been satisified with a vague answer or lie and would have found the information elsewhere and most likely from a source I would not consider as realiable as me.\n \n \nThough just in the case of an accident where maybe an older sibling had carelessly left one lying around, it is understandable that mistakes happen.

There is absolutely no regard for an individual's situation, the attack is entirely focused on women and it offers NOTHING that will help reduce abortion.\n \n ROCC's statement was quite woman-hating, but no, it is not indicative of the pro-life side's feelings about women. The only times I am compelled to really think pro-lifers are anti-woman is when they have the \"pregnancy is a woman's due punishment for promiscuity\" attitude or demand that a woman die/put her health jeapardy or demand rape victims go through with pregnancies. If you can't see the woman in even those most extreme situations, then you clearly have zero regard for women.\n\n \n I didn't feel that the argument was an attack focused on all women, ROCC was arguing that if you have sex, there is a chance you can get pregnant, though birth control can greatly reduce this, it's not 100%. We need to realize that when we have sex it's a risk we're taking, as sexually reproductive human being we should accept that we have a responsibility to accept the consequences of our actions. Though it is also true that many people completely do disregard birth control and then go have an abortion as a form of \"birth control\". Just last night when i went into work at my part time job, my 17 year old co-worker told me that she just found out that she's pregnant. She's keeping the kid and accepting the consequences of her actions. She's actually quite excited that she's having a kid and she's not the first friend of mine to become pregnant at that age and keep the kid. But the pro-life arguement is not about hating women, it's based on the fact that there is another life in there, and that if there is another human life involved, under no circumstances should the one life be taken away so that the other human can be bettered financially, emotionally, etc. In the case of a woman becoming pregnant by rape, there is another human life becoming involved. Terminating a pregnancy in the case only creates two innocent victims instead of one. If a drunk driver ploughs into your car, you don't try to justify your sorrow by taking a baseball bat to your neighbours car, the situation needs to be dealt with in a different manner. (please don't argue that that comparison is irrelivant, i was comparing how you deal with an issue when someone wrongs you, you don't wrong another innocent person to deal with the situation) The pregnant woman may be under a lot of distress and a baby may add to it, but we must recognize that the right to life is the basis of all rights, and if we take away the right to life, all other rights, including choice over your body, is irrelivent. An adoption is still an option in a situation like this, and my newly pregnant friend agreed with me on this last night.\n \n \nI believe that abortion stands it best chance at being reduced by addressing the things that lead to unplanned pregnancy and the reasons women choose to abort. To demonize women and simply take away choice without addressing these things will not reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, or gauarantee responsible choices. It will lead desperate women to desperate action, though (i.e., coat hangers).\n\n \n Well some of ROCC's comments were addressing issues that lead to unplanned pregnancy. Sexual promiscuity does lead to pregnancy, an increased rate of sex will increase the rate of pregnancies, even when birth control is a factor. I do recognize that there are other problems involved with unplanned pregnancies and issues should be dealt with, though apparently the responsibility of creating solutions to these issues is given primarily to pro-life supporters. There are two main issues that have to be dealt with; reducing the amount of un-planned pregnancies, and giving more options to people who have an un-planned pregnancy. Now this may differ country to country depending on the social services that are available to support an unplanned pregnancy. Desperate action cannot justify making morally objective issues legal, and i say morally objective since I'm sure any sane person will agree that taking away the life of an innocent person is morally objective. Governments could make a lot of money on taxing narcotics to people who wish to take use in them, though this does not justify legalizing narcotics. Desperate drug addicts will be lead to desperate situations of theft in which they even may morally object to, but must partake in in order to feed their drug addiction. Even in the case of underground back-alley abortion clinics, they were just as safe as abortions are today, and haven't been any more dangerous since the invention of antibiotics and anesthetics. These procedures, though underground, were performed by qualified physicians who either believed that women should have the choice to kill their unborn child, or just realize that there was a small demand to do so. (The actual statistic on the demand that were presented in Roe vs. Wade were fabricated by the pro-choice community ten times the actual value)\n If you require me to prove or source any of this information, I would be glad to provide it.\n \n \nFirst of all it wasn't nudie pictures. It was a book that showed the internal organs. And second, I am not gonna lie to my child or not answer a question because some other parent doesn't want my kid to know.\n\n \n I was not calling them \"nudie pictures\" myself, but only describing what children talked about when I was a kid, and how these pictures could be interpretated. I myself used to look through \"You and Your Health\" books (I'm not sure if you're aware of them, they were quite common in homes at a time though now they're generally out-dated). They really did educate me on the human body and the parts of it, though I did enjoy mainly looking at the human reproductive organs, they weren't porno, but they were the next closest thing to it. And then I was able to go to school and amaze the guys by telling them stuff they didn't need to know about all the girl's private parts. I will say again though what i said before, your son may be responsible for his age and you may feel that he's ready to deal with such knowledge, but my reasons for saying so is that other children are not neccessarily ready for such things, and children do talk. They not only talk about things they find out with their classmates, but they'll like to brag to younger siblings and their friends siblings, who may also really not be ready for such things. My younger brother's main source for such information was always myself. Though i wasn't suggesting to lie to your son about such things, but the possibility of a vague or ambiguous answer to the question. Ever see the movie Coneheads and their interpretation of a condom? \"Earthling Bubblebum\" I'm suggesting that without prior knowledge about what it is, it's not very obvious about its use.\n \n \nTeenagers should know about birth control. They should be strongly encouraged to abstain, but they should know about birth control. However, I don't know about street corner demonstrations.....\n\n \n Speaker's Corner is a short TV spot that can be inserted into TV schedules to help fill the blank spaces between short programs. People put money into the \"Speaker's Corner\" booth and then have a limted time to talk into a camera and state their opinions and such.\n \n \nSex is not a toxin. I have no problem with him knowing about it. But then I have never been a strong supporter of sanitizing the world. There are age-appropriate things, I agree, but if my son asks me a question I will answer it.\n\n \n If their are age-appropriate things, and sex is included amoung thse at a certain age, it could be considered somewhat of a \"toxin\" depending on the particular age, would it not?\n \n \nNor do I care for the inference that I am an irresponsible parent because I don't keep my kid in Disneyland. I didn't leave the condoms laying around, they were put away, he found them digging through stuff he shouldn't have been. Feel free to lie to your kids. I won't. Plus he is smart, he would not have been satisified with a vague answer or lie and would have found the information elsewhere and most likely from a source I would not consider as realiable as me.\n \n We have got to stop treating sex like a dirty little secret. \n\n \n Well I do agree that some people are going too far in treating sex like a dirty secret, most Catholic schools won't mention sex to their students, though they find out much about it elsewhere. Unfortunately this is an unreliable source, as you said about your son could have found out about the condom from an unreliable source. Instead of being ignorant to the fact that they will learn about it, they should step in and at least educate them a bit about it in a proper way. Most (but not all) of the teen pregancies that I've witnessed have occurred amoung girls who attend a catholic school. Though we cannot blame this all entirely on lack of education. Since their other sources of sex are not so great, there could be a problem with such a high availability of these sources in our culture. There is a difference in treating sexual behaviour as taboo and letting it srawl out of control, teaching teenagers about it in the wrong way. Maybe the best way to deal with it would be with a happy medium. Since we cannot deny its existance, but showing kids porn isn't a way to teach them either.",

We need to realize that when we have sex it's a risk we're taking, as sexually reproductive human being we should accept that we have a responsibility to accept the consequences of our actions.\n\n \n I am not arguing any of that. What I am saying is that the \"that's what you get for having sex (you dumb whore) now deal with it (even though we won't legislate the life of the father this way)\" attitude WILL NOT HELP A SINGLE BABY. Not one. Not a single one. I feel the comments indicate a point of view that wants to punish women for their sexuality and not help babies.\n \n \nThough it is also true that many people completely do disregard birth control and then go have an abortion as a form of \"birth control\".\n\n \n And this is an over-simplification. Why do people choose birth control? Lots of reasons. Those reasons stand whether they used the birth control or not. Now granted, we do want to encourage folks to use it, but in the cases where they don't - you will do more to help those babies if you address the reasons why a woman would choose an abortion than you will in simply out-lawing abortion. \n \n Take away the reason they feel they need to make that choice and you will be more successful than you would if you just take away the choice. Take away the choice and she will still be facing the reason - and may address it in very drastic ways.\n \n \nJust last night when i went into work at my part time job, my 17 year old co-worker told me that she just found out that she's pregnant. She's keeping the kid and accepting the consequences of her actions. She's actually quite excited that she's having a kid and she's not the first friend of mine to become pregnant at that age and keep the kid.\n\n \n How old are you? I agree that it is commendable that she is going through with the pregnancy, but I do hope she has resources and help lined up. I don't know how many 17 year olds really understand what is involved in parenting. She may want to consider adoption - or open adoption if she still wants to be involved in the child's life. Good luck to her regardless.\n \n \nBut the pro-life arguement is not about hating women\n\n \n I think I already said that I know that - and that it was the one post I felt was anti-woman.\n \n \nit's based on the fact that there is another life in there, and that if there is another human life involved, under no circumstances should the one life be taken away so that the other human can be bettered financially, emotionally, etc.\n\n \n Ah yes - but too often the pro-life side completely forget the life of the mother. You can dismiss her emotional and financial situation - but she won't - and successful pregnancies require her cooperation.\n \n \nIn the case of a woman becoming pregnant by rape, there is another human life becoming involved. Terminating a pregnancy in the case only creates two innocent victims instead of one.\n\n \n Sorry - I do not squish on this. I have been raped and been a rape counselor and I have been through a pregnancy. To force a woman to make changes as huge a pregnancy require due to the actions of a rapist is simply further violation. A nine month rape.\n \n \nIf a drunk driver ploughs into your car, you don't try to justify your sorrow by taking a baseball bat to your neighbours car, the situation needs to be dealt with in a different manner. (please don't argue that that comparison is irrelivant, i was comparing how you deal with an issue when someone wrongs you, you don't wrong another innocent person to deal with the situation)\n\n \n You analogy would work if rape victims were having abortions for revenge. That is not the case. \n \n \nThe pregnant woman may be under a lot of distress and a baby may add to it,\n\n \n You are either male or have never been pregnant or raped. Your purse is stolen and you are distressed. You are raped and you are destroyed. Your own body has been ripped from you. A rape victim needs to feel SAFE first - and that will not happen if another third party (law/government) demand she take responsibility for a pregnancy she did not consent to. Pregnancies demand major lifestyle changes, cost money, and have huge physical and emotional impacts. \n \n What if she spent a year working to win a full scholarship to a foreign program and this the only semester she can do it?\n \n What if she is about to undergo chemotherapy?\n \n What if she is a single mom who is working a job that she can't when pregnant?\n \n What if she is on meds for a serious physical or mental illness and going off them would put her at risk?\n \n What if she has no insurance and can't afford a doctor?\n \n These are only samples of millions questions any woman pregnant may have to face. To ask the irresponsible to own up is one thing - to demand it of a rape victim is 100% anti-woman.\n \n \nbut we must recognize that the right to life is the basis of all rights, and if we take away the right to life, all other rights, including choice over your body, is irrelivent.\n\n \n The rights to one's own body is not irrelevant. Why you might as well make rape. Do you have any clue it is you just said?\n \n \nAn adoption is still an option in a situation like this,\n\n \n It is. But in cases like these we are not talking about parenting. We are talking about pregnancy - and whether it is appropriate to demand a rape victim be pregnant against her will.\n \n \nand my newly pregnant friend agreed with me on this last night.\n\n \n And this old broad who has been a mom for ten years says you are way off.\n \n \nEven in the case of underground back-alley abortion clinics, they were just as safe as abortions are today, and haven't been any more dangerous since the invention of antibiotics and anesthetics. These procedures, though underground, were performed by qualified physicians who either believed that women should have the choice to kill their unborn child, or just realize that there was a small demand to do so. (The actual statistic on the demand that were presented in Roe vs. Wade were fabricated by the pro-choice community ten times the actual value)\n\n \n First of all I don't believe that.\n \n And secondly - do you want to do something about abortion or don't you? If all you want are laws that make it invisable so you can pat yourself on the back and pretend you have helped - than keep going down this track. If you want to actually help women facing unplanned pregnancies - you had better start listening to their issues.\n \n \nI was not calling them \"nudie pictures\" myself, but only describing what children talked about when I was a kid, and how these pictures could be interpretated. I myself used to look through \"You and Your Health\" books (I'm not sure if you're aware of them, they were quite common in homes at a time though now they're generally out-dated).

And then I was able to go to school and amaze the guys by telling them stuff they didn't need to know about all the girl's private parts.\n\n \n Did your parents talk to you about this stuff in a normal and mature manner? Maybe you were so amazing and amazed by biology books because the subject was such a shhhh hush hush taboo naughty naughty....\n \n \nI will say again though what i said before, your son may be responsible for his age and you may feel that he's ready to deal with such knowledge, but my reasons for saying so is that other children are not neccessarily ready for such things, and children do talk. They not only talk about things they find out with their classmates, but they'll like to brag to younger siblings and their friends siblings, who may also really not be ready for such things.\n\n \n Ready for what?!!! It's like waiting until they are ready to tell them about peeing or pooping. Sex is a normal part of human life. Treating it as such will go a long way.\n \n \nMy younger brother's main source for such information was always myself.\n\n \n Why? Could you guys go to your parents and get a straight answer?\n \n \nThough i wasn't suggesting to lie to your son about such things, but the possibility of a vague or ambiguous answer to the question. Ever see the movie Coneheads and their interpretation of a condom? \"Earthling Bubblebum\" I'm suggesting that without prior knowledge about what it is, it's not very obvious about its use.\n\n \n No.\n \n I try to be as honest and direct with my kid as I can. He is real person, living in the real world. There are some things that aren't age appropriate, but I don't hide them - I explain. \"This is not appropriate for you because......\" More problems are caused by misleading BS. Why do you spose kids go and whisper wrong info about sex to each other? It's because grown ups aren't being frank.\n \n \nIf their are age-appropriate things, and sex is included amoung thse at a certain age, it could be considered somewhat of a \"toxin\" depending on the particular age, would it not?\n\n \n No, knowing about sex won't hurt kids. \n \n \nSince we cannot deny its existance, but showing kids porn isn't a way to teach them either.\n\n \n Oh, I don't know.\n \n Stop me if I already told you this.\n \n My friend found a porno of her mom's when she was about 8 and sat down to watch it with a friend hers. Well mom busted them. Instead of freaking, she just want \"oh - you want to watch this, huh?\" - and made the girls watch several in row, whether they liked it or not. Neither of the girls was impressed or wanted anything to do with it again. My friend turned out just fine - married and has a lovely family now.",
