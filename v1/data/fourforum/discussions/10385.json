This is in our interest and that \n of our allies within the region.\n The United States favors an Iraq that offers its people freedom \n at home. I categorically reject arguments that this is unattainable \n due to Iraq's history or its ethnic or sectarian make-up. Iraqis \n deserve and desire freedom like everyone else.\n The United States looks forward to a democratically supported \n regime that would permit us to enter into a dialogue leading to the \n reintegration of Iraq into normal international life.\n My Administration has pursued, and will continue to pursue, these \n objectives through active application of all relevant United Nations \n Security Council resolutions. The evidence is overwhelming that such \n changes will not happen under the current Iraq leadership.\n In the meantime, while the United States continues to look to the \n Security Council's efforts to keep the current regime's behavior in \n check, we look forward to new leadership in Iraq that has the support of \n the Iraqi people. The United States is providing support to opposition \n groups from all sectors of the Iraqi community that could lead to a \n popularly supported government.\n On October 21, 1998, I signed into law the Omnibus Consolidated \n and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999, which made $8 \n million available for assistance to the Iraqi democratic opposition. \n This assistance is intended to help the democratic opposition unify, \n work together more effectively, and articulate the aspirations of the \n Iraqi people for a pluralistic, participatory political system that will \n include all of Iraq's diverse ethnic and religious groups. As required \n by the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for FY 1998 (Public Law \n 105-174), the Department of State submitted a report to the Congress on \n plans to establish a program to support the democratic opposition. My\n Administration, as required by that statute, has also begun to implement \n a program to compile information regarding allegations of genocide, \n crimes against humanity, and war crimes by Iraq's current leaders as a\n step towards bringing to justice those directly responsible for such \n acts.\n The Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 provides additional, \n discretionary authorities under which my Administration can act to \n further the objectives I outlined above. There are, of course, other \n important elements of U.S. policy. These include the maintenance of \n U.N. Security Council support [for] efforts to eliminate Iraq's \n prohibited weapons and missile programs and economic sanctions that \n continue to deny the regime the means to reconstitute those threats to \n international peace and security. United States support for the Iraqi \n opposition will be carried out consistent with those policy objectives \n as well.\n Similarly, U.S. support must be attuned to what the opposition can \n effectively make use of as it develops over time. With those \n observations, I sign H.R. 4655 into law.\n WILLIAM J. CLINTON\n THE WHITE HOUSE,\n October 31, 1998\n \n I don't read anything in here that says the US has the right to attack a sovereign nation that has not threatened or attacked it. Do you?",

This conflict proved to be largely ignored by the media and the public in both the U.S. and in the U.K., though it impacted the military and the citizens of Iraq on an almost weekly basis, especially since the intense \"Desert Fox\" bombing campaign of 1998. The roots of this conflict are quite simple to trace: the inconclusive and vague cease-fire agreement ending the Gulf War of 1990-1991. This agreement called on the Iraqi government to allow United Nations weapons inspectors to search for prohibited weapons in Iraq, and, perhaps more importantly, allowed the Coalition Allies (originally the U.S., the U.K. and France), to enforce what came to be called \"No-Fly Zones\" over northern and southern Iraq. The original intent of these zones was to protect the rebellious Iraqi minorities (Kurds and Shiite Muslims) in northern and southern Iraq, respectively. The Coalition was permitted to fly warplanes over these zones to prevent Saddam Hussein's government from using military aircraft to attack these minorities. As time progressed though, the No-Fly Zones became a means for the Allies to force Iraq to comply with UN and Coalition demands, often related to the status of the weapons inspectors. As tensions mounted after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, the possibility of a major escalation between Iraq and the U.S. increased dramatically, and the violence in the No-Fly Zone increased in preparation for the beginning of the Third Persian Gulf War: \"Operation Iraqi Freedom\", which began on March 19, 2003. In historical terms, the No-Fly Zone War is considered to have ended on March 19, 2003, when \"Operation Iraqi Freedom\" began and this conflict segued into the larger war. All three of the U.S.-led Coalition wars with Iraq (the 1990-1991 Gulf War, the 1991-2003 No-Fly Zone War, and the 2003 Gulf War 2) can really be seen as one long, extended conflict, but for classification purposes, are seen as separate conflicts. (written on March 22, 2003)\n http://www.historyguy.com/no-fly_zone_war.html\n \n\n \n \n\n As far as inspections go, we were ONLY to inspect for WMDs, WMD production facilities, and WMD storage facilities. They were not supposed to be \"inspecting\" the oil ministry, Saddams personal residences (at one time we literally \"inspected\" his personal bedroom for WMDs), or other facilities that could not possibly be related to WMDs.\n \n We used the weapons inspections as a pretext to attempt to completely and totally undermine Iraq's security, not to look for WMDs.\n \n Ultimately none of that matters, though, because the cease fire was not with the US, it was with the UN. The US brokered it as the head of the multinational force, but ultimately the agreement was between Saddam and the UNSC, and only the UNSC had the legal right to declare resumption of hostilities for non compliance.\n\n \n Not so according to the UK AG's analysis referenced above as well as many other legal experts. They contend that it wasn't necessary for the UNSC to specifically act on a material breach of the cease-fire agreement and subsequent resolutions. \n As for the legitimacy of the No-Fly Zones, the US argued that Resolution 688, which stipulated that Iraq could not harm its own people, gave the legal basis for the establishment of the No-Fly Zone, since SH was using his aircraft to attack Shi'ia in the south and Kurds in the north.",

COME ON. you and I are both too old to believe that the fact that somebody can come up with a nonsensical legal rational for something means it was legal. It means they are covering their butts so if they end up in court they can claim due diligence. \n \n This is not complicated.

I could make a \"reasonable argument\" that there is an alien that lives in my left ear. In fact, I could probably make that argument and win a formal debate on the matter.

The guy specifically came to the conclusion that in order to use 1441 to justify use of force it would have to go back to the SC and the SC would have to find Iraq in violation of their \"final chance\".\n \n WE DID take 1441 back and try to get Iraq found in violation and it DID NOT HAPPEN. Iraq compled with all of the requirements. Our argument for finding them on violation of 1441 had to do with the tens of thousands of pages of documents they turned over...literally dump truck loads. We argued that they came as paper copies, which would take months or even years to go through, and the US had specifically asked for them in electronic format. \n \n The Iraqis protested that the records in question did not exist in electronic format, and that (in fact) they had very few functional computers left in the entire country due to the sanctions.\n \n The only dispute that the UN inspection team had to report was a dispute over who should pay for the erection of radio towers. \n \n We ended up not even bothering to submit for a vote our resolution finding them in violation of 1441 because only the British were willing to support it. Every other nation represented on the SC argued that Iraq was in compliance of 1441. \n \n Prior to ordering the UN inspectors out so we could start bombing the bejesus out of Iraq, they told us that they were getting full cooperation from the Iraqis and that they could ifnish their inspections in a month or two. We came back with \"no, you had better evacuate the country\" and then shock and awed Iraq.",
