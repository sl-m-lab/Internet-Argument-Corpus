   "Who would win? The Man of Steel or the Son of God?\n \n It's a little known fact that there's actually some animosity between J.C. and the man who wears his undies on the outside.\n \n Check out this heated exchange I found on an internet forum after Jesus caught wind of comments about Superman's invincibility.\n \n \n (Posted by Jesus)\n I met up with superman last year...he's a pansy. Said he was the \"man of steel\". I said LOL, ###? Steel? What's that? He said \"It's a METAL, u musta heard of it!\" \"Dude!\", I said, \"What ru smoking? Bronze is the latest and greatest. u must be lying. My dad sez that's totally not cool!\" Anyway, then SuperSap just goes on and on about some Lois Lane broad and how he misses his family...what a loser. \n \n (Posted by Superman)\n I bet you more people believe in me than believe in you. How many action figures have you sold? You dont see anyone walking dressed up during Halloween, half naked with a bunch of whip marks on them saying 'Love me bitch or go to hell,\" And my sex life however lame is definitely better than that Mary chick you 'may or may not' have got with. Jesus.... you need to resurrect yourself...\n \n (Posted by Jesus)\n Superman..honestly..what are you thinking. if you keep ur lip up i'm going to turn the sun into a ball of kryptonite.. that way not only will you no longer have your \"powers\" but you will die as well.. hilarious! Later superman. By the way, my dad says ur a pansy too and if u keep ur lip up he's going to send me back to earth to own u.\n \n ***\n \n SO... who's got the goods? The fight is on!

He was looking forward, not backward.\n \n \nHang on. That was his DAD, wasn't it? My copy of the OT (\"BC Comix\" - Issue 1, Volume 1, \"Genisis\"), says \"GOD created the heavens and the Earth...\", not JESUS.\n \n Now, of course there are avid fans of the franchise who'll refer to the NT (AD Comix - \"The Rollicking Adventures of the Lord Jesus Christ\", Issue 10, Volume 30, written by John Disciple) where JC says \"I and my father are one\".\n \n These fans also like Issue 27, Volume 46, written by Matthew D' Syple. Jesus is hanging around at Calvary, after a misunderstanding wherein he asked some nice Roman folks to put him up for the night (I think - don't quote me on that).\n \n He says - \"My God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" A rhetorcal question perhaps, since John, Issue 10 Vol 30, would have it to mean that Jesus was talking to HIMSELF!\n \n It seems from this, that Jesus would have to ask his DAD to \"speak Superman out of existence\". That's no fair. Even then, BC Comix only says the Big G spake things IN - not out. He mostly sent armies, and locusts, and plagues (OH MY!).\n\n \n And don't forget John 1:1-4 that say's:\n \n Jhn 1:1 \n IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\n Jhn 1:2 \n He was in the beginning with God.\n Jhn 1:3 \n All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made.\n Jhn 1:4 \n In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.\n Verse 3 is what motivated me to give Jesus the Credit for speaking everything into existence as He is the referred to as Word of God\n \n Now whether God would actually speak someone out of existence is a good question. I mean, He hasn't done it to satan who is His arch enemy so it probably is a stretch to think that He would just speak Supy out of existence. But that doesn't mean the Phantom Zone is out of the question.",

   "Hm. Maybe just a Superhero escort service. Superman for the nice girls. Batman is for the goth girls. Aquaman for the surfers, Spiderman for the gymnasts. Wolverine for the hussies.\n\n Batman for the goth girls! LOL - good one. But never mind the dating - what about the mattress mambo?\n Superman is buff and all - it's like..., pecks, lats, delts... GLUTES! \"r-r-r-r-reeeoww\"...., And you know he has to be keeping things tidy for the ladies - you know - downtown. Smooooth. \n Technique? More powerful than a locomotive! So ask him to be gentle - or not!\n \n Jesus - one word - SWARTHY. Forget than Roman Catholic \"ultra benevolent\" white guy with a halo in the faux-gold picture frame, with the mouse brown hair and the gentle yet piercing eyes. We're talking Israeli here. Israeli carpenter. Thick black hair (everywhere) - eyes like mica.\n Of course, the outward appearance belies an inwardly gentle nature. Jesus is basically a hippy. Add to that the bronze-age personal hygiene, and you've probably got some barriers to overcome when he drops his funky desert robes in the boudiour. But once you get past the overpowering b.o., the lice, and the yellow to brown teeth with the accompanying breath with the lingering reminders of his most recent spicy middle-eastern lunch, then you'll experience a communion truly divine.\n It's like he just KNOWS what to do, and he's all about an Earth shattering climax! Jesus can indeed fill you with the Holy Spirit! In the name of the father? Oh yeah!! Who's your daddy?",

   "...the Phantom Zone is (not) out of the question.\n\n \n Objection, your honour. Facts not in evidence.\n \n Let's look at what JC brings to the table for this matchup, straight from the Bible; the same way SM has to rely on his comics, movies, etc.\n \n We've got manipulating nature (calming the Sea of Galilee). That's probably enough to say he could whip up a storm, etc.\n We've got healing the sick. Not much good in a fight, unless you want to beat your opponent to within an inch of his life, heal him, and start all over again.\n We've got the loaves and fishes. Again, combat value negligible.\n We've got water to wine.\n We've got walking on water.\n \n What else? Wasn't there something about making pigs run off a cliff? That would be handy if it worked with Superman, but it would be more of an annoyance to him than cause him any actual harm.\n \n Come on, JC - time to THROW DOWN! Watcha got?",
