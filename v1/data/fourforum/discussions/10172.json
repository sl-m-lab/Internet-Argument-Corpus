   "I believe it was just yesterday that the head of the NAACP in Atlanta held a press conference, during which he strongly condemned those who have judged Michael Vick regarding his alleged involvement in dogfighting and animal cruelty. While I agree with him, to the point that we have not heard all the facts as of yet, I could not help but recall the reaction of the Black community when the ALLEGATIONS that those evil white boys from Duke had raped an innocent and pure Black woman. We all know that the Black community practically had them lynched from day one. Honestly, can anyone REALLY look in the mirror and justify this blatant hypocrisy?",
