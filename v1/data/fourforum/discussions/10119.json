A male-killing bacteria has led to skewed sex ratios in populations of H. bolina in...\n \n Click here for more information. \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Berkeley -- An international team of researchers has documented a remarkable example of natural selection in a tropical butterfly species that fought back - genetically speaking - against a highly invasive, male-killing bacteria.\n \n Within 10 generations that spanned less than a year, the proportion of males of the Hypolimnas bolina butterfly on the South Pacific island of Savaii jumped from a meager 1 percent of the population to about 39 percent. The researchers considered this a stunning comeback and credited it to the rise of a suppressor gene that holds in check the Wolbachia bacteria, which is passed down from the mother and selectively kills males before they have a chance to hatch.\n \n \"To my knowledge, this is the fastest evolutionary change that has ever been observed,\" said Sylvain Charlat, lead author of the study and a post-doctoral researcher with joint appointments at the University of California, Berkeley, and University College London. \"This study shows that when a population experiences very intense selective pressures, such as an extremely skewed sex ratio, evolution can happen very fast.\"\n \n The researchers' findings are described in the July 13 issue of the journal Science.\n \n Charlat pointed out that, unlike mutations that govern such traits as wing color or antennae length, a genetic change that affects the sex ratio of a population has a very wide impact on the biology of the species.\n \n It is not yet clear whether the suppressor gene emerged from a chance mutation from within the local population, or if it was introduced by migratory Southeast Asian butterflies in which the mutation had already been established.\n \n \"We'll likely know more in three years' time when the exact location of the suppressor gene is identified,\" said Charlat. \"But regardless of which of the two sources of the suppressor gene is correct, natural selection is the next step. The suppressor gene allows infected females to produce males, these males will mate with many, many females, and the suppressor gene will therefore be in more and more individuals over generations.\"\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Shown is a female Hypolimnas bolina, also called the Blue Moon or Great Eggfly butterfly. The proportion of females in some populations of H. bolina in the South Pacific reached...\n \n Click here for more information. \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Charlat worked with Gregory Hurst, a reader in evolutionary genetics at University College London and senior author of the paper. Descriptions of all-female broods of H. bolina date back to the 1920s, but it wasn't until 2002 that Hurst and colleagues first identified Wolbachia bacteria as the culprit behind the distorted sex ratio.\n \n \"We usually think of natural selection as acting slowly, over hundreds or thousands of years,\" said Hurst. \"But the example in this study happened in a blink of the eye, in terms of evolutionary time, and is a remarkable thing to get to observe.\"\n \n The researchers noted that bacteria that selectively kill male offspring are found among a range of arthropods, so what was seen in this study may not be unusual, despite the fact that it has never before been described in the scientific literature. Previous research has revealed some of the extraordinary ways in which insects adapt to the pressures inherent when nearly all its members are of one gender.\n \n Notably, Charlat and Hurst reported in an earlier study that, thanks to Wolbachia, when males of H. bolina, commonly known as the Blue Moon or Great Eggfly butterfly, become a rare commodity, the number of mating sessions for both males and females jumps, possibly as an attempt to sustain the population despite the odds.\n \n Charlat added that the relationship between Wolbachia and the Blue Moon butterfly illustrates the so-called Red Queen Principle, an evolutionary term named after a scene in Lewis Carroll's famous book, \"Through the Looking-Glass,\" in which the characters Alice and the Red Queen run faster and faster at the top of a hill, only to find that they remain in the same place.\n \n \"In essence, organisms must evolve or change to stay in the same place, whether it's a predator-prey relationship, or a parasite-host interaction,\" said Charlat. \"In the case of H. bolina, we're witnessing an evolutionary arms race between the parasite and the host. This strengthens the view that parasites can be major drivers in evolution.\"\n \n The researchers focused on the Samoan islands of Upolu and Savaii, where in 2001, males of the Blue Moon butterfly made up only 1 percent of the population. In 2006, the researchers embarked on a new survey of the butterfly after an increase in reports of male-sightings at Upolu.\n \n They found that males that year made up about 41 percent of the Blue Moon butterfly population in Upolu. They hatched eggs from 14 females in the lab and confirmed that the male offspring from this group were surviving with sex ratios near parity. For Savaii, the population was initially 99 percent female at the beginning of 2006. By the end of the year, researchers found that males made up 39 percent of the 54 butterflies collected.\n \n The researchers tested for the continued presence of Wolbachia in the butterflies. By mating infected females with males from a different island that did not have the suppressor gene, they also confirmed that the bacteria were still effective at killing male embryos. The male-killing ability of the bacteria emerged again after three generations. Thus, they could rule out a change in the bacteria as an explanation for the resurgence of the males in the butterfly populations studied.\n \n \n ###\n \n http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-07/uoc--rwn071007.php",

   "WW says genetic inheritance doesn't matter, individuals individually evolve to meet their environments.\n \n Why then, should each generation be more adapted than the last, as in this study? This is exactly what NS predicts, and completely contrary to what WW predicts.\n\n \n **\n As always, this darwinist ignores the difference between cause and effect.\n That adaptedness and improved productivity wrt the goals of survive-thrive-reproduce are noted, says nothing about the cause of this positive outcome.\n Put another way, any supposed mechanism that might produce such an outcome, [i.e., adaptation], can and does \"predict\" such an outcome. By definition.\n \n To say that \"NS\", [considered as if it were a 'causal mechanism'], would account for 'fitness', [considered as if 'fitness' were a relative, statistical, differential, comparitive, positive reproduction 'effect'], and deny that any other mechanism producing adaptedness, say EAM, would not produce the exact same 'fitness' outcome/effect, is simply stupid.\n \n Of course any adaptational improvement by EAM will produce generations that are increasingly better adapted than the last. How in the world could anyone think otherwise?!?!\n \n But in this case the author's do not play the usual darwinist game, and try to fool the public into believing that \"Natural Selection\" is a \"causal mechanism\".\n In this case they are honest with us, and admit that the 'causal mechanism' in unknown, but speculated it to be, \"the rise of a suppressor gene that holds in check the Wolbachia bacteria, which is passed down from the mother and selectively kills males before they have a chance to hatch.\" This sentence is so badly constructed as to be nigh impossible to parse, and so I have no clear idea of what it is supposed to mean, other than that a gene/mutation is credited with being the causal mechanism that conferred the adaptibility that led to the 'fitness' outcome/effect that, in honest consideration, is all that \"natural selection'\" ever actually is or was.\n \n But what of the cause for the \"rise\" [appearance, generation] of \"a suppressor gene\"?!? What accounts for it? It's either/or--\n \"It is not yet clear whether the suppressor gene emerged from a chance mutation from within the local population, or if it was introduced by migratory Southeast Asian butterflies in which the mutation had already been established.\"\n \n If the latter, then 'breeding' took place, not evolution, and the effects are just what one would expect in a population bred for a certain trait--that is, the trait becomes predominant throughout the bred population. That effect, copied from human breeding, is what Darwin called, \"Natural Selection\", all the while pretending that he and his disciples could truthfully say that 'nature', as some kind of abstraction, was acting causally and teleologically, intelligently and volitionally, according to a pre-set value system, just as humans do when they practice, 'artificial selection', to bring about those effects. And that is the great, foul, and stinking lie of darwinism.\n \n Well, one of them. The other is that random damage to a complex, productive sub-system,[i.e, the genome] can, does, and always is, the basic cause of increased productivity [adaptedness] in the productive autopoietic uber-system [the organism], that that mechanical sub-system [genome] serves.\n \n If the the former, then once again evolution, this time in the form of a \"suppressor gene\", spontaneously, magically, arises, generated out of what did not have it, randomly, 'ex nihilo', coincidentally at the very instant that the organism needed it. Just like when Cinderella needed a coch and wardrobe in order to go to the ball, poof, there's the fairy godmother of random genetic mutation, with one huge difference --in this case fairy godmother doesn't even know that Cinderella and the ball exist--poofing pumpkins into coaches and mice into horses 'just happened to happen' as she was strolling by. Lucky thing for our Cindy, eh?\n \n All this darwinist stuff is so stupidly childish, it's on a perfect par with biblical literalism.",

Populations of Hypolimnas bolina on Upolu and Savaii islands in Samoa have been infected with the bacterium Wolbachia, which is passed down by mothers through the eggs, and which is also largely lethal to male offspring, usually killing them before they hatch. However, it appears not to affect the viability of females.\n \n In 2001, a survey of butterflies on the two Samoan islands showed that only 1% of the butterflies were male. In a breeding test, only 3 out of 64 females were able to produce any male offspring. Since then a new gene has entered the population that suppresses the effects of the bacterium. The populations remain completely infected with the original strain of Wolbachia, which is every bit as lethal as before to sons of butterflies without the new suppressor gene. The new gene has prospered, as have male butterflies. In the summer of 2005, informal surveys of living butterflies showed that males had become quite common on Upolu Island, while only females were found on the neighboring island of Savaii. In 2006, surveys showed not quite 1:1 male to female ratios on Upolu Island, and in breeding experiments all fourteen females produced sons, at nearly a 1:1 ratio.\n \n On Savaii Island, a really interesting result showed up. On the coast facing Upolu Island, surveys produced nearly as many males as females, and in breeding experiments all females produced sons, at essentially a 1:1 gender ratio. This fixation of the new suppressor gene on the near side of Savaii happened in one year, equivalent to ten butterfly generations. However, on the far side of the island, the new gene was still only partially established, Sex ratios were relatively skewed and half the females produced no sons. In other words, the gene has been caught in the middle of a geographic spread.\n \n \nother than that a gene/mutation is credited with being the causal mechanism that conferred the adaptibility that led to the 'fitness' outcome/effect that, in honest consideration, is all that \"natural selection'\" ever actually is or was.\n Natural selection is one process by which alleles change in frequency over generations: it is specifically the process whereby different alleles cause inheritable variations that in turn cause differential success in reproduction. The heightened fitness of the gene is clear: experiments show a near-100% suppression of males in the original-condition population, nearly a 50% suppression of males in a population that is about 50-50 in terms of the new gene, and normal gender ratios and excellent hatch rates (94-96% of all eggs) with the improved genome. This is all very straightforward, as you just acknowledged.\n \n \nIf the latter [the gene originated elsewhere and came into the islands], then 'breeding' took place, not evolution, and the effects are just what one would expect in a population bred for a certain trait--that is, the trait becomes predominant throughout the bred population.\n\n Fundamentally, evolution is change in allele frequency over time, so this is indeed an example of evolutionary change. The gene is clearly new to the population on the two islands, and while it would be very interesting to know whether it appeared due to mutation on the island or by gene flow from outside, it doesn't actually matter with respect to this being a good example of both natural selection and gene flow in action. Following the first appearance of the gene on the two islands, we have two snapshots in time that show a steady spread as the gene goes from 0% on the islands to 100% on the first island, and then to 100% on the near side of the second island, while still actively increasing in frequency at the more distant site. \n \n If this was EAM (if organisms can respond to crises by ginning up mutations as needed), then how come the gene shows a pattern of geographical spread over time, from the first island to the second, and then spreading across the second? Why don't we see a mosaic appearance or simultaneous appearance everywhere?",

However, on the far side of the island, the new gene was still only partially established, Sex ratios were relatively skewed and half the females produced no sons. In other words, the gene has been caught in the middle of a geographic spread.\n\n \n \n **\n What's your point? We already discussed this, and the upshot is, that however the suppressor gene arrived; by EAM, or by introduction from another population, or by the magic of darwinist spontaneous generation, the resulting effect upon the population, that is, the re-establishment of the normal complement of male insects, would have have come to pass, inevitably. Attributing this population effect to \"Natural Selection\" is just another darwinist shell game where an effect is asserted to be its own cause.\n \n \n\n Quote:ww\n \"other than that a gene/mutation is credited with being the causal mechanism that conferred the adaptibility that led to the 'fitness' outcome/effect that, in honest consideration, is all that \"natural selection'\" ever actually is or was.\"\n \n wells-\n Natural selection is one process by which alleles change in frequency over generations:\n\n \n **\n English may be your second language, I don't know, but a 'process' and a 'mechanism', or a 'cause', or even an 'effect', are all quite different things.\n \"Evolution\" for instance, is an historical _process_. You people define 'evolution' as the \"process by which alleles change in frequency over generations\". Now here you are trying to make \"Natural Selection\" out to be the exact same thing as 'evolution' [your definition], itself!!!\n \n \n\n it is specifically the process\n\n \n **\n Not. Alleles changing comparitive numerical frequency in relation to other, 'member alleles', in a certain genotype, over generations, is only a statistical effect, noted ex post facto. [unless you people know how to count before all the votes are in] This numerical outcome is not the cause for itself, and is not the 'process' that brought it about, either. \n \n But the statistical after-effect is the only empirical observed phenomenon that can actually be called, 'natural selection'. You have no empirical evidence for your \"NS\" when you try to portray it as a causal force.\n You say that your 'NS' is an actual, real, empirically observable, natural force that acts universally and regularly, and that therefore is a predictable and as 'natural' as gravity or magnetism or the other natural forces. That is pure horse pucky, and in 150 years of trying, you darwinists have never been able to validate that metaphysical assertion under the constraints of the scientific method. \n \n Your trouble is, if your \"NS\" is not such a force, then it is nothing but a figment of your imaginations; that is, merely a metaphysical construct dreampt up to fill in a scientific gap in your understanding of cause. Why didn't you just use, 'pixie dust', instead of 'natural selection'? That metaphor would be no less empirical, and no less \"scientific\", than \"NS\".\n \n \n\n whereby different alleles cause inheritable variations that in turn cause differential success in reproduction.\n\n \n **\n Assuming genetic determinism of the chemically mechanical, linear kind. The issue is not simply the relation between alleles and expressed traits, which you assume to be straightforwardly mechanical--the issue is origins, and origins includes the origins of genes, as well as the origins of everything else biological. Deciding that you can arbitrarily cut-off the quest for the causal mechanism behind adaptive biological evolution [as opposed to maladaptive destruction] at the gene stage, without asking about _the adaptive genes_ origins, is simply evading the real issue. And evading their origins with an appeal to 'spontaneous generation' thanks to systemic entropy, is a sick joke.\n \n Added to which is your metaphysical assumption that \"different alleles cause inheritable variations that in turn cause differential success in reproduction\", which sounds great, but which empirical field studies never ever show happening in actual fact. In empirical field studies, what is actually shown is that under a novel, robust, and chronic stimulus there are three plausible scenarioes for the adaptive oerganismic changes observed --A/ an old gene will become statistically prominent, which is simply a matter of heredity, not origins, not evolution, or, B/ a novel trait will arise without a novel gene, and be inherited epigenetically, eventually incorporated into a 'revised to suit' genome, or, C/a novel adaptive gene will emerge, spontaneously, coincidental to organismic need. Of these three scenarioes offered in explanation for observed organismic alteration, A/ and B/ are subject to empirical study and validation. But the darwinian scenario, C/, is not. It is pure metaphysics.\n \n \n\n The heightened fitness of the gene is clear: experiments show a near-100% suppression of males in the original-condition population, nearly a 50% suppression of males in a population that is about 50-50 in terms of the new gene, and normal gender ratios and excellent hatch rates (94-96% of all eggs) with the improved genome. This is all very straightforward, as you just acknowledged.\n\n \n **\n Quite straightforward, and entirely beside the point.\n \n \n\n Quote:ww\n \"If the latter [the gene originated elsewhere and came into the islands], then 'breeding' took place, not evolution, and the effects are just what one would expect in a population bred for a certain trait--that is, the trait becomes predominant throughout the bred population.\"\n \n wells--\n Fundamentally, evolution is change in allele frequency over time,\n\n \n **\n Well, that's how you guys define it in your own arcane little world. Excuse me while I laugh.\n \n \n\n so this is indeed an example of evolutionary change.\n\n \n **\n If, and it's still 'if', the gene is original, not inherited via introduction from strangers, then yes, evolution has taken place. But any assumption that this novel gene suddenly appeared, in the nick of time, out of nowhere and nothing, by spontaneous genetic generation that was strictly coincidental to organismic need, is so silly as to be insane. Prima facie, that genetic mutation was induced by the organism because it desperately needed to do something or be wiped out, and guess what, it found, very rapidly, the exact thing that it specifically needed under the circumstances. You can be superstitious and talk about good luck, but I won't.\n \n \n\n The gene is clearly new to the population on the two islands, and while it would be very interesting to know whether it appeared due to mutation on the island or by gene flow from outside, it doesn't actually matter with respect to this being a good example of both natural selection and gene flow in action.\n\n \n **\n Since both the fact that survivors survive and propagate, and that sexual reproduction affects heredity, are both nothing more than brute facts, everyday observations, dressing them up and calling them \"natural selection\"\n and \"gene flow\" is just pompous putting on airs, not science.\n \n \n\n Following the first appearance of the gene on the two islands, we have two snapshots in time that show a steady spread as the gene goes from 0% on the islands to 100% on the first island, and then to 100% on the near side of the second island, while still actively increasing in frequency at the more distant site. \n \n If this was EAM (if organisms can respond to crises by ginning up mutations as needed), then how come the gene shows a pattern of geographical spread over time, from the first island to the second, and then spreading across the second? Why don't we see a mosaic appearance or simultaneous appearance everywhere?\n\n \n **\n EAM does not claim that any organism can, as you put it, \"gin up\" any adaptive trait or adaptive genetic alteration at will. Generating originality, creativity, is extremely difficult, and very few are successful at it. Why things are that way is another debate, but that is the way it is. So just as not every student in a class gets the right answer, and sometimes only the very gifted do so, does not mean that the 'right answer' is randomly, spontaneously generated by nothing out of nothing. It is highly possible that only a few insects, [assuming it was a genetic mutation], perhaps only one, actually induced the the mutation. There is nothing in EAM to say that every organism has an equal ability to generate adaptive change as every other. In fact, EAM asserts that that is not the case at all.\n \n As for the spread, the pattern suggests that the second island received the gene from the first, but p[erhaps it generated its own. We don't know.\n \n As for the first island, where is the evidence that the mutation first arose in a single individual? It may or may not have. Perhaps there were two or three or more instances. We don't know. And even if it arose in only one individual, to claim that such a vital change, applied to such a specific, immediate, and proximate dilemma, was just a happy accident, a 'random' genetic mutation, takes a superstitious credulity that I, thank heaven, am not afflicted with.",

   "WW says genetic inheritance doesn't matter, individuals individually evolve to meet their environments.\n\n \n **\n Typical distortion. WW has never said anything like, \"genetic inheritance doesn't matter\". Genetic inheritance is extremely important to our understanding of biology and how organisms operate. What WW DID say, many times, is that inheritance is not evolution, but its very antithesis. Evolution is organismic, systemic change; particularly, [in biology], adaptive, productive change. Inheritance, or heritability, is the conservation of proven productive, adaptive traits in organisms over gebnerations. Conservation and creation are both vitally important, but they are qualitatively different from each other .\n Creation is not the mere absence of conservation, as the darwinists would have us believe with their RM and their NS. \n \n \n\n Why then, should each generation be more adapted than the last, as in this study? This is exactly what NS predicts, and completely contrary to what WW predicts.\n\n \n **\n First of all, one adapted insect is no more adapted than another adapted insect. Adaptation did not increase at the organismic level, but only at the statistical, numerical level. And so what? What's so amazing about the fact that adapted insects have progeny that inherit their adaptedness, and so they live to have even more adapted progeny, while unadapted insects simply don't produce viable males, and eventually die out? This is just a fact of life, an inevitable outcome, not a scientific insight or principle that needs a round of applause!!\n \n And BTW, WW and EAM do so predict that whenever an organism possesses the ability to survive, thrive, and reproduce, that is, is adapted, that that is exactly what it will do. Moreover, EAM predicts that when organisms do not possess the ability to survive, thrive and reproduce, then that is exactly what they will not do. EAM also predicts such things as, \"It will get dark out once the sun goes down.\", but you don't see EAM running about seeking applause for these wonderful scientific \"predictions\", do you? Only darwinists do that.",

   "Lots of words signifying mostly your lack of understanding of biology.\n \n \nEAM does not claim that any organism can, as you put it, \"gin up\" any adaptive trait or adaptive genetic alteration at will. Generating originality, creativity, is extremely difficult, and very few are successful at it. Why things are that way is another debate, but that is the way it is. So just as not every student in a class gets the right answer, and sometimes only the very gifted do so, does not mean that the 'right answer' is randomly, spontaneously generated by nothing out of nothing. It is highly possible that only a few insects, [assuming it was a genetic mutation], perhaps only one, actually induced the the mutation. There is nothing in EAM to say that every organism has an equal ability to generate adaptive change as every other. In fact, EAM asserts that that is not the case at all.\n \n ....... And even if it arose in only one individual, to claim that such a vital change, applied to such a specific, immediate, and proximate dilemma, was just a happy accident, a 'random' genetic mutation, takes a superstitious credulity that I, thank heaven, am not afflicted with.\n\n \n So EAM doesn't ensure success and isn't perfect and there are lots of wrong answers and answers left blank, so it starts to approach a hit or miss process. So since we know that copying errors occur pretty frequently, and we see lots of random substitutions of one base for another, and the results of those substitutions range from negative through neutral to advantageous, why then do you find this version of hit or miss so much less likely than an imperfect EAM hit or miss method that lacks any known mechanisms and relies totally on your unsupported assertions.\n \n \n Now here you are trying to make \"Natural Selection\" out to be the exact same thing as 'evolution' [your definition], itself!!!\n\n No, that's not what I said. You are jumping to conclusions as you read, before you even finish reading. You did this here because I started my definition of NS very similarly to my definition of evolution and you at first overlooked the difference: evolution is, fundamentally, change in allele frequency over generations, whereas natural selection is one of several processes by which alleles change in frequency over generations. NS is specifically the process whereby different alleles cause inheritable variations that in turn cause differential success in reproduction. It stands in contradistinction from mutation, genetic drift, and recombination, although it can work in combination with them. Fitness is the accounting tool that we use to record the reproductive success of specific traits.\n \n Your habit of jumping to inane conclusions before you finish reading things is apparently why you severely misinterpreted this particular study, and indeed why you similarly misinterpreted so many other studies in your posts back at ARN. \n \n This particular case study does not show any genetically based change to the phenotype at all (nor is anyone claiming that), but it does demonstrate very rapid fixation of a gene (going from 0% to 100% in ten generations), and it shows a time and space pattern that is consistent with the combination gene flow and natural selection, not EAM. The fitness part of the story could not be more evident: without the mutation, nearly 100% of the males die (and therefore have a reproductive success near 0), but with it, better than 90% of the eggs survive through to hatching (and on to adulthood, as shown by gender ratios in the adults).",

Thus EAM, being directed toward an unknown outcome determined by a specified stimulus, is not open-ended, and becomes increasingly less so as early trials are eliminated as errors and adjustments are made, narrowing the subsequent search space. The stochastic nature of RM puts the organism right back at square one after each trialm with no narrowing of search space, because there is no teleological, goal-directed 'learning' taking place. Your RM is mindless, and all positive outcomes, if any ever were to exist, would be matters of pure dumb luck.

Natural selection is one of the processes that leads to that result, either singly or in combination with other processes. Specifically it the process whereby changes in fitness (success at reproduction) due to inheritable, genetic, variations lead to changes in allele frequency in subsequent generations. They are not the same because other processes can cause evolution.\n \n \n In short, you are saying that the term , \"Natural Selection\", applies only in cases where the comparitively extended survival rate of a given organism [and its attendant increased reproduction] is directly and solely attributable to some genetic anomaly that it possesses but its otherwise identical fellows do not. Is this correct? \n\n Very nearly. It applies to the degree that reproductive success (which is often but far from always tied to increased survival) is tied to genetically controlled and thus inheritable variations in phenotype (rather than only in those cases where only that is happening). \"Solely attributable\" is correct in the sense that natural selection is that portion of any change that can be attributed to differential selective success, as long as one is clear that in nature processes are usually mixed. Thus, one is likely to find cases of changes that result predominantly from one process or another, or with different processes contributing over time, rather than purely or solely from one process. \n \n Also, although harmless so far, we need to be careful about discussing individuals, as evolution and natural selection are assessed in terms of populations rather than individuals. \n \n Survival due to luck is not natural selection: if allele frequency is changing due predominantly to luck of survival, then you are seeing evolution due to genetic drift, not natural selection. \n \n \n\"Fixation\" and \"loss\" of \"alleles\" is strictly a matter for heredity.

The researchers considered this a stunning comeback and credited it to the rise of a suppressor gene that holds in check the Wolbachia bacteria, which is passed down from the mother and selectively kills males before they have a chance to hatch.\n \n \"To my knowledge, this is the fastest evolutionary change that has ever been observed,\" said Sylvain Charlat, lead author of the study and a post-doctoral researcher with joint appointments at the University of California, Berkeley, and University College London. \"This study shows that when a population experiences very intense selective pressures, such as an extremely skewed sex ratio, evolution can happen very fast.\"\n \n The researchers' findings are described in the July 13 issue of the journal Science.\n \n Charlat pointed out that, unlike mutations that govern such traits as wing color or antennae length, a genetic change that affects the sex ratio of a population has a very wide impact on the biology of the species.\n \n It is not yet clear whether the suppressor gene emerged from a chance mutation from within the local population, or if it was introduced by migratory Southeast Asian butterflies in which the mutation had already been established.\n \n \"We'll likely know more in three years' time when the exact location of the suppressor gene is identified,\" said Charlat. \"But regardless of which of the two sources of the suppressor gene is correct, natural selection is the next step. The suppressor gene allows infected females to produce males, these males will mate with many, many females, and the suppressor gene will therefore be in more and more individuals over generations.\"\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Shown is a female Hypolimnas bolina, also called the Blue Moon or Great Eggfly butterfly. The proportion of females in some populations of H. bolina in the South Pacific reached...\n \n Click here for more information. \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Charlat worked with Gregory Hurst, a reader in evolutionary genetics at University College London and senior author of the paper. Descriptions of all-female broods of H. bolina date back to the 1920s, but it wasn't until 2002 that Hurst and colleagues first identified Wolbachia bacteria as the culprit behind the distorted sex ratio.\n \n \"We usually think of natural selection as acting slowly, over hundreds or thousands of years,\" said Hurst. \"But the example in this study happened in a blink of the eye, in terms of evolutionary time, and is a remarkable thing to get to observe.\"\n \n The researchers noted that bacteria that selectively kill male offspring are found among a range of arthropods, so what was seen in this study may not be unusual, despite the fact that it has never before been described in the scientific literature. Previous research has revealed some of the extraordinary ways in which insects adapt to the pressures inherent when nearly all its members are of one gender.\n \n Notably, Charlat and Hurst reported in an earlier study that, thanks to Wolbachia, when males of H. bolina, commonly known as the Blue Moon or Great Eggfly butterfly, become a rare commodity, the number of mating sessions for both males and females jumps, possibly as an attempt to sustain the population despite the odds.\n \n Charlat added that the relationship between Wolbachia and the Blue Moon butterfly illustrates the so-called Red Queen Principle, an evolutionary term named after a scene in Lewis Carroll's famous book, \"Through the Looking-Glass,\" in which the characters Alice and the Red Queen run faster and faster at the top of a hill, only to find that they remain in the same place.\n \n \"In essence, organisms must evolve or change to stay in the same place, whether it's a predator-prey relationship, or a parasite-host interaction,\" said Charlat. \"In the case of H. bolina, we're witnessing an evolutionary arms race between the parasite and the host. This strengthens the view that parasites can be major drivers in evolution.\"\n \n The researchers focused on the Samoan islands of Upolu and Savaii, where in 2001, males of the Blue Moon butterfly made up only 1 percent of the population. In 2006, the researchers embarked on a new survey of the butterfly after an increase in reports of male-sightings at Upolu.\n \n They found that males that year made up about 41 percent of the Blue Moon butterfly population in Upolu. They hatched eggs from 14 females in the lab and confirmed that the male offspring from this group were surviving with sex ratios near parity. For Savaii, the population was initially 99 percent female at the beginning of 2006. By the end of the year, researchers found that males made up 39 percent of the 54 butterflies collected.\n \n The researchers tested for the continued presence of Wolbachia in the butterflies. By mating infected females with males from a different island that did not have the suppressor gene, they also confirmed that the bacteria were still effective at killing male embryos. The male-killing ability of the bacteria emerged again after three generations. Thus, they could rule out a change in the bacteria as an explanation for the resurgence of the males in the butterfly populations studied.\n \n \n ###\n \n http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-07/uoc--rwn071007.php\n",

It applies to the degree that reproductive success (which is often but far from always tied to increased survival) is tied to genetically controlled and thus inheritable variations in phenotype (rather than only in those cases where only that is happening).\n\n \n **\n Somehow all this verbiage isn't really clarifying what \"it\"[NS] actually _is_.\n In fact, it's more obfuscation than clarification.\n \n \n\n \"Solely attributable\" is correct in the sense that natural selection is that portion of any change that can be attributed to differential selective success,\n\n \n **\n What the heck is this new verbalism, \"differential selective success\", supposed to mean?\n \n \n\n as long as one is clear that in nature processes are usually mixed.\n\n \n **\n How is one supposed to be 'clear' about confusion?\n \n \n\n Thus, one is likely to find cases of changes that result predominantly from one process or another,\n\n \n **\n What, \"processes\"? All of your \"processes\", [besides, \"NS\"], boil down to one-- random genetic change. Pretending that 'random genetic drift' is really any different from 'random genetic mutation' is strictly for laffs. \n \n \n \n\n or with different processes contributing over time, rather than purely or solely from one process. \n\n \n **\n For instance?\n \n \n\n Also, although harmless so far, we need to be careful about discussing individuals, as evolution and natural selection are assessed in terms of populations rather than individuals. \n\n \n **\n Well, they are among the bean-counters, it's true. But most folks don't see reality, and evolurtion, the way bean-counters do. Evolution, for us, is about organisms, and how they change, and not about how the number of beans in this jar is not as big as the number of beans in that jar. Or alleles in a genome, to put it in your lingo.\n \n \n\n Survival due to luck is not natural selection: if allele frequency is changing due predominantly to luck of survival, then you are seeing evolution due to genetic drift, not natural selection. \n\n \n **\n That makes no sense at all. In normal, non-catastrophic conditions, survival of any individual, or group, is entirely a matter of luck, happenstance, chance.\n Not only does it have nothing at all to do with your \"NS\", it has nothing to do with your, \"genetic drift\", either. You are talking theoretical nonsense that simply falls apart under empirical examination.\n \n \n\n Certainly I follow that distinction, but evolution starts with 'change in allele frequency', so they are relevant to evolution. \n\n \n **\n That's what you bean-counters tell us, since by 'evolution', you mean 'particulate evolution', the evolution of 'genomes', not live organisms.\n \n Those of us who have stuck to the original concept of evolution as a phenomenon involving live organisms, whole and entire, say evolution starts with the organism in his environment.\n \n \n\n Change the right allele or enough alleles and we've got anagenesis and/or speciation. You are playing with words again,\n\n \n **\n HAW!! Who is playing with words?!?! Oh, the irony, the irony!!\n \n \n\n and by not following standard biological definitions you are erecting and attacking a strawman. \n\n \n **\n What you call, \"standard biological definitions\", you simply mean the diushonest distortions of established word meanings that have been foisted upon the public by darwinist/evangelical atheist/materialist mechanists in order to promote their ideology by making it sound less horrible and dehumanizing than it really is. I'll leave you to your corrupt, contrived, 'darwinspeak', thank you very much, and stick to honest English. \n \n \n\n Try to understand them (or for that matter waves) on the basis of the movement of individual molecules and you'll pretty quickly be involved in statistical effects, including theoretical arithmetical projections.\n\n \n **\n All very well in the particulate reality of bean-counters, but out here in the real world of whole organisms, rather than 'bits of stuff', we'll stick to biology, and leave the molecular physics, chemistry, and statistical arithmetic to you guys.",

   "It's more of a confirmation of Rapid Adaptation rather than Natural Selection imo. It's very similar to the Finches who, in a very few generations changed their beak lengths in response to the changing environmental conditions. Natural Selection implies minute changes over millions of years leading to new species. Not noticeable changes in just a few, or even 10 generations to guarantee the survival of a creature.\n\n You know, Gradualism isn't the only side of the story. There's also a model of evolution called Punctuated Equilibrium.\n \nIn fact, the evolutionist implies that only the strong survive so the Wolbachia bacteria should have wiped out the affected butterfly species to make room for the newer stronger species that would result from the alleged Natural Selection not affected by the bacteria.\n\n There is no need for a new species to emerge for evolution by natural selection to occur. In this case, the \"stronger\" \"species\" was actually a member of the same species with a different allele.\n \nIf the species dies off, it's NS and if it survives it's NS, just a freakishly fast strain of evolution, huh ? how convenient, except you can't have it both ways.\n\n An extinction may or may not have been considered natural selection. If genes made no difference in that scenario, like in the case of a meteor, that wouldn't be considered natural selection. If genes made a difference, it would be.\n \n If some members of a population fail to reproduce while some successfully reproduce, and the difference is caused by differing alleles, that scenario would be considered natural selection. The most common form of evolution is simply a slight change of alleles within a population's gene pool.",

   "WW: In normal, non-catastrophic conditions, survival of any individual, or group, is entirely a matter of luck, happenstance, chance.\n \n Exactly. In the real world, survival and reproduction success is mostly a matter of being at the right place at the right time...and this is because each non-mutant/non-runt organism in a population is probably going to be on par with all the rest. It makes much more sense that life's unpredictable circumstances would influence survival or reproduction moreso than one's genes.\n \n I might disagree with you, though, on the concept of the group. It seems to me that natural selection could at least theoretically work on the level of the group or species. For instance, if one population of animals (lets say lions) happens to migrate to a new area, their presence may make life more difficult for another population of animals such as cheetahs because they may take dinner off their plates. (assuming they eat the same diet.) Likewise, different types of ants may compete in the same area, one eventually overpowering the other. We had this very situation in Texas, where fire ants moved in back in the 80s and quickly drove out the less aggressive native red ants.",

If you check what Wells says, for instance, you'll see that differential mortality/reproductive rates are what \"NS\" is about, and such differentials only apply in comparisons within populations of the same species, not different species. What happens when one species is decimated by a natural event, be it a flood, drought, famine, disease, or invading organism, is simply a general catastrophe. Darwinian \"NS\" does not enter the picture unless one member of the suffering population turns out to have a 'gene' that its compatriots lack--a gene that enables it and its descendents to overcome the adversity of famine or disease or competing organism. For instance, in the case of the cheetahs, imagine a novel or anomalous gene that caused some cheetahs to give off a smell that lions could not stand, forcing them to leave the area. Those cheetahs would thrive, differentially compared to cheetahs that didn't stink, and darwinists would call that, \"Natural Selection\".\n WRT your ants, less humourously and more plausibly, if the native ants were decimated until only their most aggressive and poisonous members remained to resist the fire ants satisfactorily, then darwinists would say that they had undergone, \"Natural Selection\".\n \n This because, in modern particulate darwinism, evolution is about genes and their genenome, not organisms and their traits. Therefore, \"NS\" only applies in genetic/allele differentials between the same genotypes. As per the following from the genetics dictionary [at answers.com]--\n \n \"Selection \n Selection is a process in which members of a population reproduce at different rates, due to either natural or human-influenced factors. The result of selection is that some characteristic is found in increasing numbers of organisms within the population as time goes on.\"\n \n \n \n This is confusing because once you start equivocating a good and honest word like 'selection', it become next to impossible to stop. What I've described so far is what \"Natural Selection\" is supposed to be. Unfortunately, darwinists don't stop with \"NS\", they also corrupt 'selection', per se. You will find them using 'selection', alone or in a dozen combinations with other words, to describe just about every ill the flesh is heir to. Every time anything at all impairs an organism's, or a population of organisms', ability to survive, thrive, and reproduce, at any level, some darwinist will label the cause of that difficuly 'selection', of some kind. There are now so many kinds of 'selection' floating around in darwinland that it's impossible to keep up.\n \n So of course you get 'predator' selection, and 'competitor' selection and 'parasite' selection and 'climate' selection and 'full moon in joon' selection, and 'selection' itself is rendered a meaningless catch-phrase that is every bit as scientific as the average bumper-sticker.\n \n Darwinism, reductio ad absurdum, always reduces itself to a joke.",
