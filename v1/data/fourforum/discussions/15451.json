   "Yesterday, Republican presidential hopeful and tea party favorite Michele Bachmann kicked off her campaign in her hometown of Waterloo, Iowa, where she told Fox News, \"What I want them (voters) to know is just like John Wayne was from Waterloo, Iowa, that's the kind of spirit that I have, too.\" Except Wayne--the late actor known for Westerns like \"Stagecoach,\" \"The Searchers,\" and \"True Grit,\" as well as for his conservative political views--was born in Winterset, Iowa, a three-hour drive southwest of Waterloo. Another John Wayne was born in Waterloo, but that was John Wayne Gacy, the serial killer. Gacy was locked up for a year in Waterloo for an attempted sexual assault before committing 33 murders in Illinois, for which he was executed in 1994. The name mix-up has made \"Michele Bachmann,\" \"John Wayne,\" and \"John Wayne Gacy\" spike in Yahoo! Search. Wayne, who is already a popular search term, was looked up nearly twice as much as usual yesterday, whereas searches for Gacy jumped almost 1,200 percent. See a graphic comparison of the two search spikes on clues.yahoo.com.\n\n \n Asteroid Buzzes Through Twitter, Michele Bachmann?s Mix-Up, and Twitter Sides With Supreme Court on Video Games | Trending Now - Yahoo!

   "I have to disagree. The GOP/Teabag Association can't find one amongst them who is fit to lead . All they care about is supporting the rich with special interest Tax incentives, Corporate Welfare, and their anti Liberal Agenda to dismantle everything the Government has accomplished in the last 70 years concerning the Middle Class. The GOP wants to Kill the Unions that Built the Middle class. And Worse the really radical ones in the form of Teabaggers are only concerned with shoving their religious agenda down the throats of All Americans and they don't care if they trample the constitution to do it. Gay marriage, Abortions, Healthcare, name it.. Anything that might benefit the Middle Class or the Poor or Gay people or pregnant teenagers who don't want a child... is a target for the GOP/Teabagger association. I heard Ron Paul mentioned.. IMO he's just as bad if not worse than Bachman. He's a Libertarian, no wait.. he's independent, oops... Nope.. let's go Republican( until he doesn't win the Primary) and then he'll decide what platform to run under and run anyway. I can't take the guy serious when he's claiming everything a Liberal does is unconstitutional.\n\n Wha wha, you are perfectly comfortable asserting just not backing any of it up.",
