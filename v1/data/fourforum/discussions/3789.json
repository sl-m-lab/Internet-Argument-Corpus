Where did the particle come from? Is the particle truly separate from the current universe as we know it?

Define does not simply setting parameters or \"creating\" in the sense of the proposing of a new idea, it can also mean simply setting or creating parameters in order to record in detail an idea or a phenomenon in a singular accepted way. That's really hard to explain without using the word \"define\" in the definition, so I hope it's somewhat clear.\n \n I totally agree with your distinction, though I'm not sure of the point of it.\n \n I could create and name an object, purely abstract, define it, and then hope to one day discover it, or I could take an object already that already exists and measure it and describe it in detail so as to form a definition of that object that can be used to compare it to other objects. Either way, the actual discovery is trivial, or for that matter if the object even exists, it's how it's defined, and the basis for the definition that would seem to me to be important. \n \n Anyhoo, I'm starting to confuse myself.\n \n Was gravity truly discovered? By whom? When? \n \n When birds or monkeys drop nuts to crack them, did they just discover gravity? \n \n Or is it simply a force we've always been aware of, like most of the laws of physics, but just simply didn't define? \n \n Detailed scientific studies that were conducted and led to our current understanding of gravity no doubt involved some \"discovery\", but did that work really uncover or create anything that wasn't right in front of us for eons but simply hadn't been recorded or \"defined\". To be honest, I can see both sides of the coin. I think it perhaps boils down to how one defines the word discovery.\n \n IMHO, you can't discover things that are constants, like the laws of physics, you define them according to a basic understanding.\n \n You \"discover\" a diamond mine or a burial site.\n \n That could very well be my own bias toward the word and not reality, if so, I can accept that.\n \n Waxy",

Especially when the person asking the question is Christian, it's very self defeating IMHO.\n\n \n The problem with refining this is the issue of density. If we include all the mass in a merely small space and then exploding then what we wind up with is a naked singularity (black hole or the likes). The energy measured at the big bang is acheivable only at infinite density (volume=zero).\n \n The logic behind why it had to come from somewhere is that the scientific evidence said it did not exist at some point and then it was. The question scientists ask is what was before that? It is not strictly a christian question (although christians will say they know the answer). It is part of the reason that scientists have not been able to find a grand unifying theory. One theory that ties all of the scientific disciplines together. \n \n Even astrophysicists would not say that the universe always was. They want to know what was before. I was an astropysics major for two years in college. Switched majors when we started doing vector analysis with 6 by 6 matrices. (more math than almost any human could bear).

They clash horns in fights as much about ego as anything IMHO.\n \n Waxy\n\n \n The running out of gas part is the important part here. The law of entropy states that energy is running out in the universe. It is also measurable. We have measurements from long ago (big bang time) and can project the future based on the mathematical relations. There is no evidence to indicate that the energy in the universe is increasing. In fact, entropy says it MUST decrease, especially if we consider the universe a closed system. There is no evidence to suggest that we are being recharged from outside source.",
