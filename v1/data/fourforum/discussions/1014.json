   "I want to stress the importance of keeping religion and science separate. Both areas of thought use radically different motivations for doing the things they do. Any mixing of the two can result in the intruding side being severely ridiculed and insulted. \n \n \n Usually when science and religion mix one side is intruding on the other. It's difficult to identify which side is intruding on the other... it's easy to be biased and decide one side is always the defender, and the other side is unjustly infringing.\n \n this infringement can go both ways. When scientists try to prove the bible is logically flawed, or a certain idea of god is logically flawed... this is science infringing on religion. Religions are systems of though that instruct people on how to live their lives, and to what end they should live their lives. It has to do with morals, ethics and opinions. Science has no business commenting on any of these three topics. \n \n The mixing can go the other way too. When individuals try to use commonly accepted ideas in their religion to change accepted practices in science... this is religion infringing on science. Science has a unique perspective of the natural world that relies only on what can be objectively observed. \n \n I say it's improper to mix science and religion... but this does NOT mean an individual can not be actively involved in both areas. There does not necessarily have to be any contradictions between these 2 idea. as an example: the bible says a world wide flood occurred, while science says there is no evidence for a world wide flood. \n \n if the bible was right, and a flood actually did occur, how does this impact science? science still depends on objective evidence, and would continue to support the wrong conclusion until evidence to the contrary was found. This does not detract from science because science depends on objective evidence to conduct itself. It would hold onto this incorrect view until evidence was found to contradict it. It is perfectly alright for science to draw the wrong conclusions... just as long as those conclusions derive from the current evidence.\n \n What if science is right, and no flood occurred. how does this impact religion? The bible has the same message, and the messages from god do not change. he still instructs you on how to live your life, and why you should give him thanks, regardless of what other individuals say. \n \n in conclusions... umm... just try to keep it separate people. No one's basic beliefs about a given system are shaken when these two groups collide... but opinions about the other side are damaged instead..",

And there's a large number of Orthodox who talk of the creation of Genesis in literal manner.\n \n I wrote this on another forum...\n The connexion of Adam to Jesus is always being made in Christianity. \n Irenaeus (Bishop of Lyons c.177-200) says \"in the first Adam we offended God by not performing his command; in the second Adam* we have been reconciled, becoming 'obedient unto death'.

Water boiling at 100 degrees Celsius can be verified by anyone who has the desire and the means to test it. The existence of God can not be independently verified. There are no tests that produce predetermined results that can be observed. Not even \"miracles\" are evidence, because you don't know when they will actually happen. How many times is a person prayed for, and they are not healed, or they go on suffer, or they still die?\n \n \nSeems rather as dogmatic as what you're accusing me of. I do think at best, you're just as arrogant as I am on this issue, because we both believe we are right, but for different reasons. You haven't been able to see that your own rejection of evidence as evidence is based on your own a priori beliefs.\n\n \n The a prior beliefs is not a rejection of the spiritual or supernatural world.... The a prior belief is that science does not have the means to make any decisions about the spiritual or supernatural. The rejection of evidence comes on the unverifiable nature of the evidence you suggest. \n \n \nI understand this happens in my camp too, which is WHY I don't put my faith in a system as weak as evolutionary science. At very best because it can't deal with the real issues of life, that is, life itself, it's pretty pointless as a belief system.\n\n \n so since you think both thought systems are flawed, you go with the one that assumes it already has the answers for everything... even if physical evidence points to different conclusions. If you think the \"real\" issues of life focus on the spiritual world, so be it. Science only focuses on the physical issues of life. Since that is it's only area of interest, and attempt to get science to accept \"real\" evidence won't work, unless you can show it has an impact on the physical world. \n \n \nIs being honest a problem for you? If it is let me know. Or are you now going to tell me that after arguing in favor of scientific materialism (Darwinism) you're going to 'keep an open-mind' and entertain the though that God might just might exist? I doubt that, because otherwise I'd have to question why you've been arguing so forcefully against religious evidence as evidence, unless you just enjoy debating (see above if you want to know my reasons).\n\n \n Evolution is falsifiable. If a fossil were found in a rock later that dated back to a radically different date than what has previously been found, and a study was done to show there was not a mistake, or a fluke, then evolution would have to be changed or dropped. If the earth was shown to be much less than 4.5 billion years old then evolution would be changed or dropped. Like all scientific theories, it is falsifiable, and tentative. \n \n The supposed \"limitations\" of science are not limitations at all because science doesn't try to explain morals, or ethics, or the afterlife. It only deals with the physical world, and systems that have an impact on the physical world. The attempt to convince science to support your \"evidence\" is asking science to out step it's bounds. If you do that then subjective experiences would be admissible as evidence, and ancient documents that contain stories that are not possible by any physical process studied today would have to be taken as historic documents. If this were the case the limit would not be just on what you offer. Science would have to accept all subjective experiences from all religions, as well as all ancient texts, no matter what they say.",

That just means someone made a faulty observation.\n\n \n So, it's not because it does do it, but because everyone agrees that it does.

At very best because it can't deal with the real issues of life, that is, life itself, it's pretty pointless as a belief system.\n \n \nso since you think both thought systems are flawed, you go with the one that assumes it already has the answers for everything? even if physical evidence points to different conclusions. If you think the ?real? issues of life focus on the spiritual world, so be it. Science only focuses on the physical issues of life. Since that is it?s only area of interest, and attempt to get science to accept ?real? evidence won?t work, unless you can show it has an impact on the physical world.\n\n \n Any system that involves humans is flawed. That is why we rely on God, who is perfect. Our lives are worked at being back with God.\n SO you're saying feelings aren't real? I'd hate to be your child especially at Christmas \"No presents because there's no proof of Santa, and you can't feel disappointed because your feelings are wholly subjective and in no way verifiable!'",

I can hear the Beatles for myself. I can be moved by them. I can ask other people what they thought of the Beatles, and why the harmonics, and rhythm, and message was so powerful. Religious experiences can not be experienced in such depth. All I can do is ask someone \"did you have a religious experience?\", and I have to take their word for it. I don't have any religious experiences to compare his or her experience to... unlike the Beatles where I can listen to them and think \"ahh, yeah I see where this person is coming from.\"\n \n Opinions, social matters, morals, and ethics are all outside the bounds of science. Just because science can't explain it doesn't mean it's not there. But before you jump all over that, just because science can't explain it doesn't mean it IS there either. And since I have seen no evidence to support the existence of any god, I simply leave it at that. I have seen no evidence for the existence of a god. \n \n \nThey can't devise objective tests if their raison d'etre is to prove the other wrong.\n \n So, again, what % makes it right? Some will in deed lose support, some will re-gain support, so effectively, what is right now, might be wrong next day, and then next year is right again. Sounds rather faddish for a belief system.\n\n \n Overwhelming support from evidence makes it \"right\". And you CAN have objective tests even though the individual is biased. If they cheat on their tests, or the bias seeps into their work, then when other scientists try to verify the work they will say \"look dude, you did something wrong\" and the evidence they found won't support them anymore (it won't exist any more). \n \n \nYou could ask them. After all, I believe the Beatles are great, and most people agree. Therefore they ARE great, because that's the test!\n\n \n So popular opinion makes it true in matters that science won't touch? What is the most common religion in the world?\n \n \nNot all miracles are experiential. Some, such as the miracle cure fo a cancer can be tested. If doctors say someone has no hope at all, because of the extent of cancer, then wowee! the cancer goes away, then that can be tested. And they have, that's why the Catholic Church will declare something miraculous.\n \n There's a number of Catholics reading this who'd know more about it. I wish they'd not remain silent\n\n \n Occams razor tells us to, at first, not consider needlessly complex parts of a system. So we have two ideas. 1) (yours) Sometimes God decides to heal cancer sick patients... when he does this it is inexplicable, and a miracle. 2) (mine) some percentage of cancer patients inexplicably heal from cancer for no cause, other than it's random. The outcome of both of these ideas are exactly the same (in that some people who are prayed for do not get healed, and some patients who are not prayed for do get healed). Which one is right? They could both be right since the outcomes are the same (connected to given the exact same outcome for 2 situations, how could you tell the difference?). Occams razor tells us to not assume the existence of god, and to instead do tests to discover how random the healings are, who gets healed, what religion they belong to, how many people were praying for them... etc. \n \n And it's very bad form to rely on other people to find supporting evidence for you. If you think it's out there, go get it. \n \n \nIf only.\n\n \n if only what? When the scientists walk by the cage they see people on the outside saying they saw inside the treasure chest? What if several different people say they saw different things inside the treasure chest?\n \n (do you actually get this analogy, or is it flying way over your head?)",

   "Look, from a human perspective I can make judgments on things that require opinions. I can hear the Beatles for myself. I can be moved by them. I can ask other people what they thought of the Beatles, and why the harmonics, and rhythm, and message was so powerful. Religious experiences can not be experienced in such depth. All I can do is ask someone ?did you have a religious experience??, and I have to take their word for it.

The way I'd structured the test affected the type of answers I'd get... because of the expectation I'd have created unintentionally upon my students.\n \n Likewise, consider the studies into IQ tests which are shown to be culturally biased, based on the questions that they ask.\n \n If you gave a standard IQ test to a Bushman of the Khallihari you'd conclude, based on the results of the test, that the bloke was sub-normal. Thus the 'objective test' that the IQ test is supposed to be, is actually quite relative.\n \n This is actually leaving semiotics, which does concern itself more with the signs and symbols, the layout etc. However, clearly the IQ test was established to make meaningful comparisons of intelligence. That is why they have a standard... so that they can compare your results to mine based on the same test.\n \n A better analogy perhaps;\n That Miller-Urey test for abiogenesis.\n Miller hypothesised about the conditions that existed in the pre-life world, in order to see if he could get amino acids, or whatever to form.\n \n As Behe countered; it was akin to a chef saying \"I wonder how a chocolate cake might come about - what if I take cake mix, water, eggs, etc, and add some energy (heat) voila! A cake!\"\n Nothing miraculous there in the kitchen, the test got what you'd created!\n \n This might be a poorer analogy\n At school I'd set up a test for separating oil from water based on the different boiling points/evaporation points of the two. I asked the lab assistant to turn the apparatus on. When the two markers came in to test it, it wasn't ready. I actually got marked down for not actually 'proving' anything... because it wasn't working.\n \n The assessment of me was based on a test that would have worked, had they only had the patience to see it.\n \n \n Perhaps you can come up with an 'objective test'. I can't think of any, but that doesn't mean much.\n \n Just for fun I typed 'objective test' into ixquick search engine. One of the first responses was (http://www.columbialab.com/products/j4alert.shtml) a breath-tester. It immediately claims to be 'objective', I suppose in a sense it is as it gives a result without making a judgment, though the result will be varied, depending on if the testee has had mouthwash or not... which some police services will recognise can give varied and inaccurate results.",

   "Religious truth and scientific truth won't contradict.\n\n \n if they seemingly contradict each other, which is wrong?\n \n \nThere's slight of hand at foot. Are you saying now you believe in the super-natural? I thought you'd just spent days believing only what science can explain, and a few added perceptions such as love?\n\n \n what is wrong with you? I'm not ruling out the possibility of divine intervention... but it's along the same lines of probability as alien abductions, haunted houses, mediums that contact loved ones from beyond the grave, and psychics. Any of these things could be possible, but in lack of supporting evidence (anecdotal does not count) I'm going to try to find natural explanations. \n \n \nAre you becoming religious? No, but you're not really saying that you believe miracles do happen, just that they might somewhere some day.\n\n \n yup... and someday, somewhere all the wrist watched of the world might bite of their owner's hands. \n \n \nWhen the Nazis occupied Europe, they treated PoWs from Western nations comparatively well. Treating them well did not make them saints. If the devil 'heals' someone physically it is a small price to pay to get their soul.\n\n \n Do these people of other religions know they are selling their souls to be healed by the devil? \n \n \nThough some cures are miracles, I'm talking about other miracles... \n\n \n how do you tell cures that are miracles apart from cures due to random chance?\n \n As for the other sites, it's late and I'm tired. I'll read them tomorrow and give them the attention that you think they deserve. \n \n But just real quick, make sure these miracles happen uniquely with your religion... otherwise you can't provide them as proof that your religion is true with out admitting other similar events as evidence that another religion is true.",

   "Check out a real miracle at http://www.sancta.org/intro.html\n\n \n http://www.csicop.org/sb/2002-06/guadalupe.html\n \n I'm not saying this site with out a doubt proves how the lady of Guadalupe was created naturally, but it has just as much evidence as other sites I've found. I could not find any sties that described a study of the tilma. All I saw were religious oriented sites proclaiming that several scientists couldn't explain the garment (the same scientists for all pages).\n \n I admit that the appearance of the painting is incredible as long as there was no way to produce the image, and ensure longevity at the time of it's creation. However since it seems like most websites are offering this image as religious proof, and not scientific proof you're somewhat alone in the fight for getting science to admit that it's limitations are detrimental to understanding the world. \n \n As for the people in the eyes... do you have some pictures of the actual people? I found 2, but one of them didn't like part of the picture at all, and the other just looked like a couple white blobs. Several web sites say the same people are found in both eyes but in slightly different positions. I'd really like to see a comparison of these pictures... but I really doubt they would be very convincing. Are you sure these people in the eyes are meant to be people, and not just shapes that humans wanted to see?\n \n \nThere are other miracles such as Stigmata (http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14294b.htm)\n\n \n but how many are actual cases that are not cased by self mutilation? How many cases of the perceived pain are actually psychological in nature? Granted sometimes it's unexplainable... but how many similar wounds happen to Christians that are not in the religiously significant places? How many similar wounds and random pangs of pain occur to non Christians?\n \n \"However, newer archaeological research shows that nails were more likely driven into the wrists of the crucified, where the arms' bone structure would better support the weight of the body, Martinez said.\n More recent stigmatics have had wounds in their wrists instead of in their hands, Martinez said.\"\n  http://www.tennessean.com/local/archives/02/07/20134669.shtml?Element_ID=2013466\\\n \nFor a comprehensive definition go to http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm\n\n \n I'm having trouble getting through this one. It's long a dry. Care to point out how miracles are more than just seemingly improbable events? And how there is a static way to gauge if an event is a miracle (a \"miracles\" that ceases to be a miracles when a natural process is shown to be the likely cause is simply a god of the gaps argument)?",
