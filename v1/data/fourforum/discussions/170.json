   "Here is a debate that occurred on the communist forum I frequented, where I asserted that there was such a thing as an anti-American and proposed a method of cleansing them from our society. Don't jump to conclusions, without first reading how I propose to cleanse this problem. Read first, and judge later.\n \n Note: Redcomrade is a member of another board\n This debate occurred during the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday when the anti-Americans took to the streets in a foaming at the mouth approach to weaken our resolve.\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Redcomrade took issue with a quote where I said it is high time America cleanse itself of the human garbage that will be protesting in Washinton this weekend. I already posted my reply in my ignorant statements thread, but I thought this subject could use its own thread. Here is what he said:\n \n \n\"I think it is high time America cleanse itself of this type of human garbage\"- Stormin Norman \n This is quite possibly the scariest XXXX I have heard Norm say as of yet. That cleanse part brings up some terrible recolections of past governments \"cleansings\". If you love this country Norm than you should understand the best thing about it is that theoretically you can say whatever you like and no matter how unpopular it is you wont end up \"cleansed\". If you ever took power Norm or someone else with the cleansing idea took power and they tried to put into affect cleansings of radicals on my soil wether the radicals be fascists or stalinists or fundamentalists I would fight to death to destroy your Gestapo XXXXXXXX and ensure that evry man be he nazi, stalinist, islamic fundamentalist, or moderate has the right to a voice without ending up in a\"cleansing facility\". May you and those like you never come to power here or nywer!!!\n\n \n I stand behind that statement 100%, although not in the mass murdering connotation that he suggests. As we have external enemies, we also have internal enemies. The internal threat comes from immigrants and anti-American left-wingers. These are people who see our freedom as a weakness and aim to exploit it. They cite the first amendment while they speak sedition. Let me remind you that plotting the destruction of the system is not protected speech. In war times it becomes extremely important to monitor the actions and intentions of potential domestic threats. \n \n It is undeniable that there exists a growing faction among the population of the U.S. dedicated to undermining the U.S. civil society, government institutions, and underlying ideals of the American nation. When the war dice have been rolled, there is no predetermined outcome and the stakes remain high. The worst scenario, in this case, is the destruction of the greatest endeavor of liberty ever embarked upon by a segment of humanity. Many times it is fear for this type of human condition that drives those who aim to destroy the United States, and it is this freedom that I aim to protect, sometimes through the use of extreme measures. A number of times in our history we have had to resort to methodology that appears contradictory to the ideals those measures were aimed at protecting. \n \n Let me direct you to the U.S. Sedition Act of 1918; Section 3:\n \n Whoever, when the United States is at war, shall willfully make or convey false reports or false statements with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces of the United States, or to promote the success of its enemies, or shall willfully make or convey false reports, or false statements, . . . or incite insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty, in the military or naval forces of the United States, or shall willfully obstruct . . . the recruiting or enlistment service of the United States, or . . . shall willfully utter, print, write, or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language about the form of government of the United States, or the Constitution of the United States, or the military or naval forces of the United States . . . or shall willfully display the flag of any foreign enemy, or shall willfully . . . urge, incite, or advocate any curtailment of production . . . or advocate, teach, defend, or suggest the doing of any of the acts or things in this section enumerated and whoever shall by word or act support or favor the cause of any country with which the United States is at war or by word or act oppose the cause of the United States therein, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or both...\n \n Clearly, a distinction was made regarding the types of speech that this law was aimed at destroying. What this law did not protect was seditious attempts to undermine the U.S. government, or speech designed to weaken the morale of our armed forces, or the resolve of the nation at large. Did this action have a negative effect on civil liberties? To those who enjoy and cherish the freedom's granted under the 1st amendment, probably not. More than likely they found themselves more involved in actions that benefited the country rather than emboldening the enemy. However, certain opinions were probably held back for fear of prosecution, so it did act to hinder the expression of ideas. Like it or not, the Sedition Act definitely had the cleansing effect to which I was referring.\n \n I have a question to ask those leftists that wanted to believe my statement was a reference to politicide. Apparently you have a very healthy fear of being persecuted for your thoughts. However, you protect a political and economic system that has proven to be the most efficient model for killing those who oppose the state. Why is this? Do I dare say that you support it, so long as the type of thought targeted runs anti to yours? Why do you protect Saddam, a man who is guilty of removing the tongues of those that offer the slightest criticism of his method of rule; and demonize a man who is willing to take action to remove his terror from the world? Could it be that you only care about the 1st amendment, so long as it allows for your movement to expand to the point where you can desecrate the Bill of Rights, and commit the type politicide that communists are so famous for? When does the left quit trying to separate the results from the model used? Marxism was the model used by Stalinists, and Maoist alike.\n \n I know there are some here that would like nothing more than to label me a Nazi and dismiss me. Now, was I referring to a new Sedition Act when I suggested that vermin supporting anti-Americanism represent a problem that must be cleansed? No. I, like those on the left, propose we use the 1st amendment, but as a tool for the destruction of our enemies rather than the destruction of our country. An atmosphere has been created where enemies of the U.S. feel comfortable in vocalizing their perverted viewpoints. It is obvious that the views one espouses can be used as an indicator of where their loyalties lie. I would never suggest that we start locking people up for having a dissenting opinion, for I often hold unpopular views. However, a person's ideas can provide insight into the types of actions, or the activities that they may be engaged in. A criminal mind will more than likely lead to criminal activities. Once a person identifies themselves as an enemy of the United States, investigators can then try to charge them with the commission of whatever crimes they might be involved in. That is, if they happen to exist. By evaluating the speech coming from different segments of the population, you can then narrow the scope of the search and allocate law enforcement resources wisely.\n \n I have long been an advocate for our system of government. To hear my enemies, who support the vilest system of government, allege that I support the types of acts that I am committed to fighting disgusts me. I suggest we use a system of justice to defeat those who present a credible threat to our way of life, not mass graves. I hope this clears the air.",

   "Stormin:\n \n I belive I see your point. Although I can also see why the verbage you used seriously pis*ed people off.\n \n I will take a big leap here as in Stormin's first post. As in above, read the whole thing and judge.\n \n I belive we should use our system of government to the fullest extreme to find internal enemies and persecute them. This does not mean we should suspend, bend, or subvert any protections the Constitution gives us. The checks and balances that have protected us should not be ignored.\n \n Political protesters can ride a fine line between politcal expression and sedition. Throwing gasoline bombs at cops in a protest and that turns into a riot (in the 60s) was not sedition, but most definately an arrestable offense.\n \n Trying to change the politcal process to end or stop a war is not sediton. Going to Iraq to become a human shield or just \"talk\" with Saddam is (Sean Penn).\n \n When extreme measures are used (Japanise internment camps in WW2), with the benefit of hindsight, we all know it was wrong. When extreme measures are used, the people who used them know they were extreme. That should be the first sign that \"new extreme\" measures are probably wrong.\n \n We have all the tools we need to defend our freedom. We don't need to invent new machineary to protect us.\n \n GW has approved the killing of US citizens abroad without due process and in secret. Sanctioned killings are not new, is this extreme?",
