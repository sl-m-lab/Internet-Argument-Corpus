   "Since Galileo has refused to answer on how certain proposed gun laws qualify as \"reasonable\" I've decided to expand on it a bit; I'm going to explain why these proposed laws are unreasonable in nature.\n \n 1. A ban on \"assault weapons\"\n I consider this law to be unreasonable for many reasons. Firstly the definition of an \"assault weapon\" is 'any semi-automatic firearm capable of accepting a detachable box magazine and possessing two or more of the following features: a collapsible or folding stock, a bayonet lug, a pistol grip that extends beneath the firearm, a barrel shroud that covers part or all of the barrel, a flash suppressor, a threaded muzzle that is capable of accepted a silencer.'\n \n The only way to define a so called \"assault weapon\" is to go exclusively by its appearance, not its functionality. This is basically saying that it's alright to judge by looks alone; which conflicts with the politically correct setting we live in where if you so much as look at a black person the wrong way they'll be suing you for racial discrimination.\n \n There's nothing reasonable about telling someone that they can't have a gun because of how it looks, that it's appearance makes it evil; and yet if the cosmetic features are removed it's no longer classified as an \"assault weapon\" even though nothing internal has changed and it still functions the same way. The semi-automatic firearm goes back to 1896, it's hardly anything new. So claiming that it's somehow more deadly than others just because of a few cosmetic differences is stupid, fear mongering, and outright dishonest. The Brady Campaign has gone on record saying that the appearance of the firearms in question, and the public's lack of knowledge about machineguns can only serve to further the call for their banning; that tells you right there that they don't care about honesty.\n \n Furthermore, in DC v Heller, the Supreme Court ruled that a ban on an entire class of firearms is unreasonable and unconstitutional, and nobody can deny that \"assault weapons\" are a class of firearms according to the gun ban crowd.\n \n 2. Gun rationing laws\n I consider this law unreasonable for a number of reasons. The primary reason is that this law conflicts with federal guidelines that govern multiple firearms sales.\n \n If you sell or dispose of more than one handgun to any non-licensee during a period of 5 consecutive business days, the sale must be reported on ATF Form 3310.4, Report of Multiple Sale or Other Disposition of Pistols and Revolvers, not later than the close of the business day on which you sold or disposed of the second handgun. The licensee must forward a copy of the Form 3310.4 to the ATF office specified thereon, and another copy must be forwarded to the State police or local law enforcement agency where the sale occurred. A copy of the Form 3310.4 also must be attached to the firearms transaction record, ATF Form 4473, documenting the sale or disposition of the second handgun.\n \n A business day for purposes of reporting multiple sales of pistols or revolvers is a day that a licensee conducts business pursuant to the license, regardless of whether State offices are open. The application of the term &#8220;business day&#8221; is, therefore, distinguishable from the term &#8220;business day&#8221; as used in the NICS context. Example: A licensee conducts business only on Saturdays and Sundays, days on which State offices are not open. The licensee sells a pistol to an unlicensed person on a Saturday. If that same unlicensed person acquires another handgun the next day (Sunday), the following Saturday or Sunday, or the Saturday after the reporting requirement would be triggered, the subsequent acquisition of a handgun would have to be reported on a Form 3310.4 by the close of the day upon which the second or subsequent handgun was sold.\n \n [18 U.S.C. 923(g)(3), 27 CFR 478.126a]\n \n Federal law already governs firearms sales, the ATF already has all the tools necessary to locate individuals purchasing multiple guns at a single time and determine whether or not they're a straw purchaser. But these laws that say you can't buy or sell more than one gun every 30 days, seek to undermine these federal laws, and as a result actually shield the straw purchasers and allow them to remain free and on the loose; nobody can deny that.\n \n 3. A ban on \"ammunition that can easily defeat police body armor\"\n This is unreasonable, because 99% of ALL rifle cartridges are capable of piercing the kevlar vests usually employed by police officers; but then again so can most knives and even hunting arrows. The police choose to deploy vests that provide protection against common handgun ammunition because it provides the best balance between protection, comfort, and mobility; anything higher will weigh them down and be worn less.\n \n Just because the police choose substandard protection for themselves, doesn't mean that honest people should be put out over a technical matter that's inflated for the purpose of fear mongering.\n \n Any rifle cartridge that will effectively kill a deer, elk or bear without exception will always penetrate standard kevlar vests without fail, so banning them would put an end to nearly all hunting as well. \n \n Some will argue that the 5.7x28mm cartridge, which can fit into a pistol, is armor piercing, but the ATF has specifically stated that this ammunition is NOT armor piercing in nature, and the manufacturers have gone to great lengths to dilute the already poor ballistics of this cartridge, in the name of political correctness despite the evidence that such is necessary.\n \n \n More to follow...",
