   "I heard some interesting things on the new book about Karl Rove today.\n \n Putting party affiliation aside, Karl Rove is what's defeating John Kerry.\n \n Why:\n Karl Rove is at the far end of the spectrum when it comes to \"the average joe\". He will stop at nothing to win, and is constrained only by his imagination, and the imagination of those around him. If it's legal, it's game. Even the grey legal areas, fair game. Stop at nothing.\n \n How:\n One of is hallmark strategies is to attack, relentlessly, negatively, on the opponents STRENGTHS, rather than weaknesses.\n \n Let's look at today's news. Todays headline: \"Bush took the easy road out with the reserves, and didn't really show up for duty all that much, etc.\"\n \n OK, who here, on either political side of the fence, really cares about this? This is old news, and he's been PRESIDENT for the last 4 years. In fact, it seems sort of \"human\" of him to dodge the way he did (for the supporters). Why would a swing voter care about this old news? It's a weakness, it's never been a strength. Most everyone has some negative opinion on Bush and his reserve duty, but how much ADDITIONAL negative opinion can we get from this \"latest news\"? I say, little to none! What a colossal waste of money and air-time.\n \n Let's look, in contrast, at the republican's swift boat campaign. It turns out that it was completely without basis, an obvious political paid and promoted gig that had veterans lying on TV. Yet they didn't break a law doing it (well, possibly slander), and it attacked, relentlessly, what Kerry was promoting as a STRENGTH.\n \n Half the democratic convention was about the vietnam record, they toted it out there like some great thing, a strength, and it's now in tatters, despite the allegations being completely false. So what are we left with? Well, we already know Kerry's weaknesses, now we doubt his strengths? What a tremendous political blow. \n \n The more I look at this political campaign, the more signs of this I see.\n \n They also noted that Rove did these same things vs Ann RIchards (Texas) who's strength was being an open and all-inclusive leader. They had some folks break the rumors that Ann Richards liked getting more gays and lesbians in office (why that's bad I don't know, but in conservative Texas, devastating), turned her strength into a liability. He did the same with John McCain vs Bush. McCain was a POW, while Bush dodged the war. Sure, great strength to have, but some \"independant\" group (Kinda like the swiftboat vets eh??) doubted McCains emotional stability as president (aka, McCain is nuts after being a POW) and gave enough doubt on one of his biggest selling points. UnAMerican? You bet. Worth it to win? You bet.\n \n So we see the same style again, and the democrats are either:\n 1. Not putting winning first in their priority (over morals, ethics, etc.)\n 2. Not any good at political strategy (attack what you gain the most on..i.e. strengths not weaknesses)\n \n Or both.\n \n Thoughts?\n \n -Mach",

   "You know, I think they are trying but not doing quite as good a job as the Bushies. They are the masters.\n \n We haven't even gotten to the middle of September yet. You'll see, they'll pull it out piece by piece. We've already seen \"527\" ads (on the 'news') attacking Bush's National Guard service. They are saving it all up for closer to the election.

How can you blow the Bush thing off as just \"old news\" and not mention once that is has been refuted? The man who claimed that he helped Bush get in swore under oath in a deposition that while he was Lieuteneant Governor he helped get Bush in the Air National Guard and that the Bush family talked to him and tried to get Bush in. He SWORE under oath. And now he has recanted this and said he never spoke with the Bush's, nor helped Bush get in. And Bush received an \"honorable discharge\", which allowed him to go to Harvard Business School. He fulfilled all of his duties in Texas, and then transferred to Alabama.\n \n \n But when the Swift Boats come out with ads that have claims that have been proven to be true, you say they are \"completely without basis\" and that they \"had veterans lying on TV\". You might be one of the biggest hypocrites I have ever heard of, and one of the most naive at that.",

You might be one of the biggest hypocrites I have ever heard of, and one of the most naive at that.\n\n \n \n I posted this while watching the ad. Who cares if later the guy who spoke on the ad retracted his statement, it doesnt' affect the point. But interestingly enough, I have never seen what you're referring to (although I have no reason to doubt it), so your assertion that I'm a hypocrite isn't accurate. You assumed I have seen this guy retract his statement, which I haven't. So you missed the point, and your judgement is questionable.\n \n Go debate the truth or lack of truth in the ad on a different post. But I'm still hearing CNN talk about a 5 month gap in pay and drill, a missed physical, and other questionable information on his record. The \"Bush issue\" still being floated by democracts is Bush's service record from years ago in the guard.\n \n But I don't care either way, that has no bearing on the point.\n \n Just for you, so you don't get red-faced at anything that slights Bushy, let's assume: Neither ad is based on fact, or rather, who cares if the ads are factual or not.\n \n Despite the lack of factual basis (for either, neither, who cares), one is a much better use of air-time and money:\n \n 1. The swiftboat ads seemed to have a significant negative impact on Kerry's campaign.\n \n 2. The swiftboat ads attacked one of Kerry's perceived strengths.\n \n 3. The new ad from the anti-Bush 527 attacked a weakness of Bush's and seems to have little to no effect. I.e. a waste of money.\n \n 4. The campaign strategy employed by the republicans, just in looking at this apples to apples comparison (527 ads) seems to be on target. I haven't seen \"on-target\" campaigning yet from the democrats. Why?\n \n **Edited after reading a post or two down***\n \n Ahhhh, you're Bush is the Man. That explains the antagonistic response and personal attack when anything was mentioned about Bush, even though it wasn't the point of the post. It also explains the appearance of the word \"hypocrite\", one of your favorites, and why it was used inappropriately (i.e. used by you). All is well, carry on.\n \n -Mach",

Osama?? ;) \n \n I'd rather be hearing about current issues. Bush has served for 4 years as president, it can be seen as a strength or a weakness. I just don't think attacking vietnam issues from years ago that aren't clear cut either way, could possibly impact his record of 4 years as president.\n \n -Mach",
