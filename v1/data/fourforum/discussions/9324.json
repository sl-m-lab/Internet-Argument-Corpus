   "Personally i don't believe in abortion. It's morally wrong and i think it's good that it's illegal. \n\n \n I think often abortion is wrong but I do not agree with criminalizing it. Primarily the reasons that are used to justify criminilzation are hugely fallacious and secondarily because it won't do a thing that is positive. A woman who is determined to end her pregancy - will. Criminalization will simply make it extremely dangerous. I am responsible, have even had my tubes tied, but if I were to become pregnant and that pregnancy were the result of rape or a threat to my health or livlihood I would end it - and I will not be checking the law books first. Every woman has her line in the sand - abortion will go on regardless of its legal standing. There are a miriad of reasons seek abortion - comdemning those reasons does nothing (i.e. calling them selfish) - addressing them could help. The reasons are valid.\n \n \nIn my area girls under the age of 16 who fall preganant must have their parents permission before they can abort their baby which i think is a good thing.\n\n \n I am torn on this one. Should a parent be able to make a life altering choice like that for their daughter? At the very least they should not be allowed to stop her from selecting adoption. And I do believe measures need to be in place where a girl can go to a judge to get premission for one if she is in an abusive home. My sister in law worked at a domestic violence shelter - she had 13 year old in there, pregnant by her own father, with the mother's consent. A judge immediately emancipated her so she could get an abortion and she was then placed into foster care.\n \n \nNowadays too many teenagers are getting drunk and having unprotected sex which leads to pregnancy and because they can't be bothered to look after the baby that get abortions. It was their fault in the first place for having unprotected sex so i don't feel sorry for them and they should either keep the baby and deal with the fact that it's their responsibility now or give the baby up for adoption, if they feel they are old enough to have sex then they are old enough to loo after a baby.\n\n \n There are so many things to address in here. Let me start by saying that I am a 36 year old mom - so I know what I am talking about when it comes to parenting. Secondly I strongly advocate encouraging personal responsibility in people and in our teens. I think strong, in your face, reality check sex education is needed. They need to talk to teenage moms in the ghetto. They need to talk to people who are living and dieing with AIDS. They need to see just how much it costs to have a baby and then to raise it. We need to stop teaching girls that men are the end all be all meaning of life for them - (\"when you get married....\", \"when are you gonna get married?\", or the two I hear \"why don't you remarry?\", \"why couldn't you keep your husband?\") - this MANATTHECENTEROFTHEUNIVERSE idea we push on girls will lead to sex. We have to get rid of the nagative stigma that comes with being a single female.\n \n These things said.\n \n Much of what you say in your last paragragh is so dead wrong.\n \n 1 - It is not just teens who seek abortion.\n 2 - Looking after a baby is a REALLY BIG DEAL. Its expensive. Its hard. It requires a LOT of responsibility. Most teens do not have it. It is absurd to assume that a pregnancy will suddenly mean you get touched by the responsibility magic wand. Teens are generally a bad choice for parents. I do think that if the girl is healthy enough to maintain a pregnancy, has access to adequate health care and the baby will be born into or given to an environement that can adequately support it, that she should be encouraged to have the baby. And that she can stay in school. My neice had a classmate expelled for getting pregnant (Catholic school). That enfuriated me. \n \n Under absolutely no circumstances should pregnancy be used as a punitive measure - as your stance seems to suggest. It is absolutely abhorrant - and what a legacy for the child \"hi I am here because my mother needed to be punished for having sex.\"\n \n \nSome people don't realise this but it is an actual living thing that you are killing when you have an abortion, \n\n \n Actually I think most people DO realize this.\n \n \nhow could anyone kill their own child, because they are selfish or just aren't ready for kids, well if you're not ready for kids than you should have used protection.\n\n \n Agreed - birth control should be used, readily and easily available to anyone who wants it no questions asked.\n \n However, you are trivializing the lives and reasons women choose abortion. \n \n Not being ready for kids - what does that mean, why aren't they ready? And the reasons go beyond this - \n \n Money - pregnant women and babies do not live off of air - this reason ties to things like jobs/careers/education. It is not selfish to need to support oneself - and in many cases they may have others they are supporting as well.\n \n Health - not just whether the pregnancy will kill the woman - but lots of health reasons. Will a pregnancy cause her damage? Is she undergoing treatments/medications for a life threatening disease? Is she a vulnerable adult? (Primarily the learning disable or severely mentally ill - i.e., it is not a good idea to take a severely dillusional schizophrenic off her meds if it means she will try to fly off bridges.). Is she a severe addict?\n \n Home life - is she in an abusive situation? I had friend who got pregnant by a man who would have killed her if he found out. I had another a friend who was thrown out of her house at 16 for being pregnant.\n \n This is just the tip of the iceburg. Pregnancy is a complicated and disruptive even when planned. Do not trivialize this - try to meet it in the middle and your will stand a better chance at reducing abortion than condemning people will.\n \n \nBut it's these silly women who get themselves pregnant then don't want the baby. \n\n \n Women do not get themselves pregnant.",

   "thelmoose, your post was a little nit picky for saying you don't like it when people doing it...I think you went a little overboard but you did make some good points for he/she to think about and I will address those.\n \n \nWe make things illegal because we think doing so will make a better society than if they were legal. This is unrelated to whether we judge them as moral or not. What are the consequences of making abortion illegal?\nThis is not exactly true. We can make laws based on moral judgments...in fact, claiming something is \"better for society\" is a moral judgment. Even so, a standard for \"what is best for society\" involves looking at morals and determining how you want to better society. I guess many laws come down to moral claims at the very end.\n \n \nThat is not a very compassionate stance.\n This is a good point...it wasn't compassionate at all. Playing the blame game is not gonna help the situation.\n \n \nA fetus is a distinctly different thing than a child.\n While true I am not sure that this matters. A child is distinctly different from a teenager who is distinctly different from an adult.\n \n \nIs it murder or isn't it? Is it morally wrong or not?\nI agree...you can't take the stance of saying compassion will sometimes override a life. If a couple breaks up and the girl is sad you don't say \"well.. I have so much compassion for the girl that this justifies me killing the guy\". It is inconsistent and takes the focus off preserving a life and makes the focus a punishment (or something) against a woman.",

   "Firstly, i don't know why you're all trying to read in between the lines. I am in my late teens. I am not trying to be compasionate and although i'm not perfect, i can easily decide whether i get pregnant or not. The reason why i say this is because a lot of my friends have got themselves pregnant, yes they GOT themselves pregnant because although it takes two to tango it doesn't take too much effort to go to the chemist. Protection is made so easy these days for young ones, it's practically handed out on a plate and it's very private (parents need not know). But they are so nieve and lazy that they don't bother, they'd rather bury their head in the sand. Honestly, i live next to a city which has the highest teen pregancys in Britain and do you want to know the reason for high sexual activity? Boredom! Yes they're that bored they just go out get drunk and have sex. In Scotland we do get sex education (we even have electricity!), which is very good and it put me off but it still doesn't stop a lot of others who viewed the videos as old fashioned and silly.\n \n As regards my knowledge of childcare i am currently studying it at college and have looked after many children since i was the age of 11. My mother has manic depression and therfore it was me who practically raised my little brother who has ADD and learning difficulties and he was born when i was 11. Not only my Mum heavily relies on me but so do many of my Mothers single parent friends. So please don't undermine me.\n \n Also, i know that teens aren't the only ones that are irrisponsible (unwanted pregnancy) but the only excuse for unwanted pregnancy in my books is if the couple decided not to use drugs as protection and the condom splits/slips. Or, if they get pregnant on the pill which is very rare.\n \n The only thing i do have compassion for are pregnant rape victims. As i simply stated in my other post i still don't condone abortion, i simply understand them wanting to have an abortion.\n \n Ps, No offense to anyone, this isn't directed at anyone but being a mother doesnt automaticaly make you a good mother.

Besides being rather insulting, it shows that he thinks it is all the woman's responsibility, even if contraception fails.\n \n And I like how you automatically assume here that the woman is \"sleeping around\" when you talk about how she'll probably never see the guy again after casual sex. It shows your TRUE colors. Hate to break this to you, but plent of these cases are with women with steady boyfriends or even thoe who have already been married. I was engaged when I had an abortion, when our contraception failed (I was on the pill, and he had a condom) It was an unlikely occurence, but just one example of a case that abortion should be allowed (especially in the case of rape). We aren't that rich, both of us are going to college and under enormous student loan burden and just would not have the time or money to support a baby yet (that's why we used contraception).\n \n I do agree, that more emphasis should be placed on preventing pregnancy, I am not arguing with him on that at all. The problem is, most anti-choice people I have talked to in fact favor not teaching about birth control in schools. How the heck would that do any good?

There are stronger versons of these drugs though, e.g the rod, injection etc. These other variaties are more or less 100% protection.\n\n \n Like I said, there are reasons that the women may not use birth control. You do not know every women's circumstances. Saying that is like saying all black people are criminals. Its a gross generalization.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nJust to clarify, \"its_just_me\" is reffering to teenagers who are appathetic (can't be bothered) about protection. Their attitude is: \n \n \"Oh, I did it once without protection, I can't get pregnant\"\n \n Or\n \n \"I was too embarrassed to get protection\" (as quoted by Shooterandproud, who is very humble about his manhood....erm, I mean over exagerated manhood)\n \n ETC ETC ETC and the excuses go on and on.\n\n \n You imply over and over again how stupid they are and are making excuses. That implies that they should be punished. All of your post implicate punishment but when confronted directly you deny it.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nI agree with most of what \"its_just_me\" has said, the issue she's trying to put forth is that people should be more concerned about preventing pregnancy in the first place, not just about abortion.\n\n \n I agree. But, what does this have to do with the abortion debate? Its irrelevant.",

   "Yeah, I totally beleive you. emoticon_rolleyes ;) Sounds to me like someone trying to worm their way out of being caught expressing themselves as two different sexes on two different parts of the board. I bet you hoped no one would notice that, huh? Seems rather dishonest of you.\n\n \n Hmm, I think I'd rather defend myself just as a woman, no need to turn myself into a man...why's that going to make people listen to me more?\n \n By the way, thinking_person is my fiancee, ever wonder why he kind of sticks up for me? He doesn't agree with everything I say but he does tend to stick up for me, read his posts. It was HE who posted the post about not being ant-gay because one of his 5 brothers, who's 19, is gay (whereas my only brother is 6 and I don't even have a sister). It is my fiancee who grew up in the religious background:\n \n \nJust another note, I'm not anti-gay. For one thing, I'm more in touch with my feminine side than most guys are. My best friend was my sister while growing up, I relate more to my mother than I can with my father. I can talk for Britain with females, but I have little in common with males (football, cars etc). I bodybuild, I like to look after my apperance etc (don't mean to sound vain though). I used to be acused of being gay at school, so I know what ridicule is like. And finally, and most importantly, my brother's gay! I haven't forsaken him however. Before you say I must be hiding something here, I am engaged to a woman and have never had homosexual tendancies.\n \n Do you think that I'm trying to ban gays or something? Because I seem to remember the title of this thread being \"what does the bible say?\" Since I have studied the bible (and if I were to be biased, it would be on the homosexual side) I am simply putting across the TRUTH. I'm not trying to find loop-holes in the bible, just conveying it as it is.\n \n I am sorry for disapointing you all about what the bible teaches. To tell you the truth, like the first post said, the churches do pick and choose what they want from the bible (except that being gay isn't acceptable). Take for example, getting involved with politics, wars and even Christmas (which isn't Christian, it's half pagan and isn't even mentioned in the bible) etc. Wars, politics etc are what the churches get involved with and this was STRICTLY forbidden by Jesus HIMSELF! (e.g. he said be no part of this world, and love your enemy etc).\n\n \n You'll then notice that my fiancee (after registering a new username because we can't carry on using the same one) suddenly starts replying in the thread with a different username (i.e. thinking_person) by accident (cause he forgot to login as its_just_me again like before):\n \n \nHere's another example political correctness gone mad. Ok, maybe I am being a bit sterio typical here but you've got to admit it, most gay men are like that.\n \n \n \n Yes...I simply have, in much depth. So where are these inconsistancies (or contradictions as some people say)? Please provided examples, which I shall refute.\n \n \n \n I'm glad you used the word \"think\" instead of know, because you dont know and are simply wrong. Of course Jesus strictly forbade things! He didn't use the word forbid, but he didn't approve of plenty of things (in other words, he forbided his deciples to do whatever it was he didn't approve of).\n \n Matthew 5:21, 22 (Jesus says here that yes, the old law says not to murder, but equaly important is not to be wrathfull towards your brother)\n \n Matthew 5:27, 28 (Jesus says here that yes, the old law says not to commit adultery, but equaly important is when you're married not to look at another woman with passion)\n \n Mattew 6:7 (Jesus said when praying, do not say the same thing over and over again)\n \n There are many more examples (of what Jesus disapproved of) from other bible writers too, but that could fill another thread.\n\n \n \n Is that enough proof yet that I am the author of \"its_just_me\" and am a woman, or do I have to show my tits on webcam? (that's a rhetorical question by the way).",

   "How much love can we give as a parent if we view our child as a consequence? Children are supposed to be blessings... people who view their children as a blessing are probably going to take their job as a parent a bit more seriously than those who are pushed into it. A 13 year old girl who is barely developing into a woman herself is not going to be a fit parent for a child compared to a woman in her twenties (that may actually want a child). If a girl doesn't want a child she will in one way or another find a way to get rid of the fetus. I know people who have punched themselves in the stomach until they miscarried. You may say \"...crazy.\" But I say disparate situations. Anyway, I don't think the person I'm talking about should ever have children unless she changes. This girl is a drug addict, alcoholic, and abusive... so I would rather have that fetus be aborted than have it be growing up in a world like hers. (Though I don't agree on the way she aborted because she caused a lot of harm to herself in doing so).\n \n Also... I don't like it when people start saying stuff like \"Baby-killer\"... A fetus is not a baby. A baby can live outside of the mother's body, do that with a fetus and you'll be doing that very thing you're against (killing it).",

I don't see how baby killing is ok. \n\n \n A foetus is not the same as a baby. There are many differences, two important ones probably being mental awareness and ability to feel pain, which don't develop until quite far on in pregnancy, much further on than the majority of abortions which happen in the first trimester. \n \n \nIt is still a baby and a life, and we have no right to take that life away. \n\n \n No, it's a foetus and a life. You also don't know the reasons people have abortions, and can't possibly understand why they felt that the best decision to make would be to abort their pregnancy. Whatever the reasons, it's a woman's decision on what she does with her body, and pregnancy isn't something anyone should be forced into. \n \n \nI don't see how someone can go party, have sex, kill a life, and still sleep at night.\n\n \n I never had sex at a party. You are pretty much generalising anyone who has an abortion as someone who has unprotected sex with someone they have just met -- that's obviously not the case for everyone. I, for one, fell pregnant to my boyfriend and father of my 16-month old daughter, who I live with, while also on the pill. I made the decision to abort the pregnancy because we have just taken on a lot of financial committments and if I had another child I wouldn't be afford to care for my daughter in the way I can just now. I can still sleep at night because I did what was best for my family. \n \n \nWell if thier not responsible enough to care for the kid, how are they responsible to have sex? Cause and effect. you also asked if we knew what it is like to be 14 and pregnant. Yes it does happen, but that does not mean that does not mean that you can take the easy way out and kill it.\n\n \n Abortion isn't an easy decision, or an easy thing to go through. And saying that someone wasn't responsible enough to have sex is hardly an excuse to punish them by allowing them to give birth to a child, which takes far more responsibility. Pregnancy should never be seen as a punishment, and forcing a baby onto someone who doesn't want to love and care for that child isn't any more humane for that baby than an abortion which takes place before the foetus is mentally developed. \n \n \nWhatever you do in life, you are going to have consequences, good or bad, and to succeed with those choices, you don't take the easy way out.\n\n \n I took the best choice for myself and my family; that was a good decision for me.",

   "Are you suggesting that women who deliberately have sex to get pregnant, are not deliberately getting pregnant?\n\n As jitobear mentioned, there are almost always TWO people involved in the actions that result in pregnancy, not just one (a woman AND a man having sex) - therefore, women don't \"get themselves pregnant\". \n \n However, I understand you to mean that, if they willingly engage in sex, then they have the responsibility over the resulting pregnancy.

In your scenario, they never have a choice about their pregnancy so they are being forced. Laws and their execution are the only means by which our society can force any of its individuals to do anything. For example, people are forced by law to pay taxes.

I wish to have a million pounds, that doesn't mean I force a million pounds on myself, does it? \n \n Besides you said so yourself:\n \n \"Laws and their execution are the only means by which our society can force any of its individuals to do anything.\"\n \n Only society can force individuals to do anything, not me. \n \n \n\n Question / Statement:Secondly you too support forcing women, by law, to keep their pregnancies and not abort them - thereby forcing them to carry their pregnancies to term. \n Answer: I force this to happen in the third trimester for reasons other than the few exceptions I gave - risk to mother's life, health, rape, incest, major birth deformation. However, by the third trimester, she would have had six months to decide whether or not to keep the pregnancy. There is a world of difference between that and what you suggest, which gives her NO choice EVER in her pregnancy about whether or not to keep it. I DO give her choice, it just has a time limit. You give her NO choice. That is a BIG difference.\n \n I don't know how many times I can rephrase the same answers. If these answers are not sufficient for you, then how about if you explain WHY they are not sufficient instead of repeating yourself over and over. \n\n \n I'm not asking you if there is a difference, I can see that, but if I force women to carry pregnancies to term on the conditions you have stated, then you too force women to carry pregnancies to term regardless of when you choose to force them, force is force. If you force them earlier or later then me, it still amounts to force.",

As for this inane arguement, I really am stopping my participation here since I need to log off and leave the computer.\n\n \n Exactly, so I'm not wrong on those grounds, you need to find a reason why I'm wrong, if there is one, you have yet to present it.

Then, and only then can you mount an argument to claim I'm wrong, until then please don't make inaccurate accusations.\n\n So, let us present our reasons. It will make for a far more interesting discussion.\n \n I think you are wrong in forcing a woman to keep her pregnancy in the first and second trimester since I, and pretty much all others on the pro-choice side, place a lot of value in a person's right to their own body and forcing a pregnancy to term is a violation of that right of the mother to her own body. If it were only a question of the woman's right to her body and no other rights of any other person existed regarding her pregnancy, then the issue would be clear cut for her entire pregnancy. However, the question on both sides of the debate is \"When does the FETUS acquire rights?\". Though people on the pro-choice side differ in their views (ex. some say that the fetus does not acquire rights until birth), apparently most would severely restrict third trimester abortions - suggesting that most pro-choice advocates start taking the fetus's rights into account at that point (third trimester). I myself find mental existence to be the critical development (be it even a rudimentary sense of self, rudimentary thoughts or emotions, or a sense of registered pain - as apposed to mere reflex action). Science tells us that this cannot develop until around the start of the third trimester, when sufficient connections develop in the cerebral cortex of the brain. Before the fetus develops a rudimentary mental existence, it is just a body with \"nobody home\" which, in my view, does not get rights. I did not exist as a person until I started to do so mentally. If I had been aborted prior to that time, nobody would have been hurt. The same goes for any fetus. After that mental existence starts, then there is a balance of the rights of the fetus to life vs the rights of the mother to her own body (or any other rights that come in, such as her right to self-protection if that fetus's life is risking hers). In general then, I would leave abortion completely free in the first and second trimesters and restrict it to a few exceptions in the third trimester (including risk to mother's life, severe risk to her health, mercy killing and possibly rape, incest).\n \n So, what is your justification for forcing a woman to continue her pregnancy in all trimesters? \n \n Judging from our earlier discussions, I will guess that you will attack my position without presenting any of your own. Therefore, I participate in this discussion only under the condition that we address both views at once - i.e. I address your points and you address mine. Discussions have to go two ways, not just one way. Agreed?",

I rely on what neurologists say since they are the most knowledgible about the workings of the brain.\n \n \n So you can't prove it, please just say so. \n \n \n\n I'm not quite sure what that definition meant by \"mental powers\" but if they meant something along the lines of mental processes then, when we sleep, we can dream. Dreams are certainly mental processes.\n \n \n So you have no proof again.\n \n \n\n Again, to have any mental process, a sufficiently developed cerebral cortex with signs of its activity in brain waves is necessary. Does that mean that there definitely are mental processes going on if there are brain waves? Maybe not. But that means that mental processes CAN happen. They CANNOT happen if the cerebral cortex is insufficiently developed. I am giving the fetus the benefit of the doubt. Are you suggesting that I should not give the fetus the benefit of the doubt and wait until the fetus is conscious so that the mental processes are most proven? That would move the position farther away from the pro-life stance which you seem to hold, not closer to it. \n \n \n No proof again. \n \n This is a disaster for you. \n \n \n\n Unconscious people can still have a mental existence.

   "If you give rights when mental existence can exist, what do you suppose happens to the unborn when left to develop? It gains mental existence, therefore it can exist in the unborn. \n\n As I said before, once the unborn develops enough so that it CAN have mental existence, I give it rights. I do not give it rights BEFORE it can have mental existence. Therefore, it gets no rights in the first and second trimester and I would allow unrestricted abortions then. Yes, if left to grow, an embryo will most likely develop mental existence but that is in its future, not in its present - meaning that it has the POTENTIAL to have that mental existence but does not have it NOW. It is its current state which I judge in determining if it has rights - not its future state. After all, a pre-fertilized egg also has the potential to become a full person if a few things happen (including fertilization). I judge the living entity in question by what it is *at that moment*.\n \n If you do not understand that point, I will put it another way. There are three states of knowledge about the fetus's mental existence:\n 1) Prior to roughly the beginning of the third trimester, it CANNOT have mental existence (as supported by evidence of neurologists). Therefore, I do not give it rights.\n 2) At some point, there is concrete evidence of mental existence - perhaps once it first gains consciousness. It clearly has rights for me at that stage.\n 3) There is a period of time from around the beginning of the third trimester to the point where we definitely know it has mental existence. During this time, we just don't know either way if it has mental existence. One can either err on the side of caution (as I do) and say that, since it CAN have mental existence during this time, give the fetus rights. This runs the smallest risk (indeed zero risk) of unjustly aborting a fetus that might actually have mental existence at that moment. Otherwise, one can err on the side of certainty and not grant the fetus rights until mental existence is proven. That runs a fairly big risk of unjustly aborting a fetus that might have mental existence at that moment - which is why I prefer to err on the side of caution instead.\n \nNo, quite clearly you are wrong, he is saying \"Countless people, facing persecution the world over - people living and those as yet unborn\".\n \n It says: \"and those\", it is quite clear.\n\n Look, as I have, at various ways in which people use the term \"those as yet unborn\". When I googled that term, it usually referred to future generations. Either way, this is not an important point since I have already showed that Amnesty International is neutral on the subject of abortion (or even currently leaning toward supporting abortion rights). Where your quote is concerned, few people care what Peter Benenson said. He is only known because of founding the organization Amnesty International that does have world clout.\n \n I also refered to the UN Declaration of Human Rights (the most relevant to our arguement) and how it does not outline fetal rights as being included.

   "As I said before, once the unborn develops enough so that it CAN have mental existence, I give it rights. I do not give it rights BEFORE it can have mental existence. Therefore, it gets no rights in the first and second trimester and I would allow unrestricted abortions then. Yes, if left to grow, an embryo will most likely develop mental existence but that is in its future, not in its present - meaning that it has the POTENTIAL to have that mental existence but does not have it NOW. It is its current state which I judge in determining if it has rights - not its future state. After all, a pre-fertilized egg also has the potential to become a full person if a few things happen (including fertilization). I judge the living entity in question by what it is *at that moment*.\n \n If you do not understand that point, I will put it another way. There are three states of knowledge about the fetus's mental existence:\n 1) Prior to roughly the beginning of the third trimester, it CANNOT have mental existence (as supported by evidence of neurologists). Therefore, I do not give it rights.\n 2) At some point, there is concrete evidence of mental existence - perhaps once it first gains consciousness. It clearly has rights for me at that stage.\n 3) There is a period of time from around the beginning of the third trimester to the point where we definitely know it has mental existence. During this time, we just don't know either way if it has mental existence. One can either err on the side of caution (as I do) and say that, since it CAN have mental existence during this time, give the fetus rights. This runs the smallest risk (indeed zero risk) of unjustly aborting a fetus that might actually have mental existence at that moment. Otherwise, one can err on the side of certainty and not grant the fetus rights until mental existence is proven. That runs a fairly big risk of unjustly aborting a fetus that might have mental existence at that moment - which is why I prefer to err on the side of caution instead.\n\n \n You even said so yourself the unborn can have mental existence. \"Can\" means the possibility, the unborn in its earliest stages will develop to gain mental awareness. \n \n It is not a different species prior to mental existence, it is an unborn, it can become mentally aware. \n \n It can. \n \n \nLook, as I have, at various ways in which people use the term \"those as yet unborn\". When I googled that term, it usually referred to future generations. Either way, this is not an important point since I have already showed that Amnesty International is neutral on the subject of abortion (or even currently leaning toward supporting abortion rights). Where your quote is concerned, few people care what Peter Benenson said. He is only known because of founding the organization Amnesty International that does have world clout.\n \n I also refered to the UN Declaration of Human Rights (the most relevant to our arguement) and how it does not outline fetal rights as being included. I noticed that you ignored that.\n \n You also have still not given a reference to the Human Rights Act which you mentioned. As I said, I tried Googling it but found nothing with regard to a general US Human Rights Act. So, which one do you mean?

Now, the most vulnerable have become the victims of the very organisation Peter Benenson had designed to protect.

You missed the point about the analogies. \n\n \n Elucidate. \n \n \n \nRegardless of where or when abortion was first legalized, there has never been a deliberate, systematic targeting of ALL unborn babies. There was just permission given to rid one's womb of an unwanted attachment. Women who wanted children could stay pregnant. \n\n \n I'm not talking about the wanted unborn, I'm talking about all the \"Unwanted Unborn\".\n \n \nNether is? I've been to the Netherlands, so it must mean something.\n \n I know 'extinctocide' is not a currently defined word. But when the day comes that there's a deliberate, systematic drive to kill all unborn children, we'll have to make up a word for it. Genocide generally implies that someone is trying to get rid of an enemy. If we're trying to kill all unborn children, we're getting rid of ourselves...causing ourselves to become extinct...hence 'extinctocide\" would be a good word to coin.

That specific sentence referred to my denial of your claim that \"unwanted unborn\" are an ethnic group. When I questioned whether the term \"unwanted\" was important, it was only in the context of whether it was important to the question of whether it would fall under the term ethnic group.

I have my suspicions it will be the elderly, in about 50 years time.\n\n Well, all you have done in this last part of your post is to restate one definition of the word \"person\" out of a choice of at least three (without justifying why you think that is the only valid definition). Outside of that, you have made comparisons to the struggle of black people again without going into details in the comparison.

As for your comment of black not being a general category, the US government and blacks themselves disagree with you. Again, there are general categories of race and, under that, there are subcategories (ex. specific African racial groups). It is a simple concept.\n \nDon't try and turn the table on me, you made the mistake not me, just as you claimed that most pro-life people support the death penalty, it was a huge mistake, yet just another wild claim and totally unsubstantiated.

Once again you are distorting my views and claiming victory based on those distortions. Since you seem incapable of winning an arguement by logic, I see that this is the only way you can try to claim victory.

Yet again, you miss the point and then claim victory based on your lack of comprehension and logic. \n \n If you are trying to extend the definition of genocide or discrimination from its standard definition to include fetuses and embryos, you have to show in what way SPECIFICALLY the two are related.\n \n Are you EVER going to give detailed, logical reasons behind your views?

I couldn't even imagine going through with something like that. \n \n I was reading on it, and how they might accidently leave a babies arm or leg in you. They warn you about it.\n \n Parents should know. For those who are in an abusive situation, well we need to work on better support groups.

I'm very sorry to hear that you have to raise your little brother. People have tough times. My mother was a drunk, violent. Parents divorced.

She's beautiful in my eyes, and i'm sure in others as well.\n \n Back to abortion, It's murder, it is. They say it should be the mother's choice? Is it the mothers's choice when the baby is out of her and she's been caring for it for five years, and she decides that she doesn't want it anymore and she DROWNS IT. Ot even as simple as we're getting now to where you'll get prosicuted for giving your child and old fashioned spanking hmm? Well It's murder. We need to do more to help these women get through the pregnacy. With work leave whatever. But when 1.6 million babies are getting aborted a year. Somethings wrong. \n \n I've so much to say and i'll post a thread, when i'm able to. Because of the fact that I need 5 comments on here before I can post one. So until then tonight I think I've reached the end of my abortion research and debates. Thanks for listening.\n \n Sorry i was a little harsh mispelled words i'm like tired beyond beliefe.",

And again will be different for each individual.\n \n \n 3)Again personally I believe it to be too easy and I definitely believe that it should not occur late in a pregnancy without strong medical grounds.\n \n QUOTE]\n 1.) Very very true. I completely agree. So many people have so many feelings about so many different things. So many different religions and beliefs. Therefore there will always be a counter argument that has the equal amount of inspiration, and statistics, and emotion. Which a lot of time between people causes problems, because no one's willing to actually listen. Which is why I'm loving this online debate stuff, because it doesn't quite matter if a person reads it or not, it's there and everyone (hopefully) Gets the satisfaction of it being at least acknowledged.\n \n 2.) Totally. Yes, it really does. Uhm let's see... In the circumstances that a woman has a problem with the baby inside her, and if she doesn't have an abortion it will threaten her life. Only in that case do I believe killing the baby is the only choice. Otherwise I am really, strongly against abortions. \n \n 3.) I wish it wasn't performed. Yet the thing of the matter is now they've put it to where you can have an abortion up to 9 months. \n \n If we're going to keep abortions then at least I think we should make the law a little more strict. Like having parental permission, or not letting someone have an abortion if it's way into the pregnancy. My question is, why on Earth would someone wait that long to get an abortion. They've already gone through with the morning sickness, the pain of contractions. Why not just have the baby and give it up for adoption?\n \n Neanderthal79:1.)\"Another thing for you hardcore conservatives. You don't see many white, anti-abortion women having black fetuses transplanted into their uteruses, do you? You don't see them adopting crack babies, do you?\n \n 2.) Think about this. If there were no abortions, this country would be overrun with criminals. Man, I hate to say that, but its probably true.\n \n 3.) If you use scripture to debate, you're an idiot\"\n \n \n 1.) Maybe not, but I know quite a lot of white people who have adopted a black baby. Personally as a hardcore conservative, i don't think race is important. I think people shouldn't look at the color of our skin to identify us. I think it's sad when people do. I mean actually at the rate that white people are having children (less and less). I think in maybe within a 100-200 years the white community will no longer be white-white. I think there will be very few white people like maybe just to give an example: Less then 10% of all schools will be white. But that's just my opinion. Because there are so many interracial couples now. Which is great, and i support. It's really good for the genes, and helps prevent disabilities for the baby.\n \n 2.)I think I understand where you're coming from... If you could help me out a little more I'd love to listen. It sounds logical... But I'm not sure where you're coming from with it. Yet again I do think abortion is a crime so it just depends on your logic =0) \n \n 3.)\n I personally don't see how you'd be an idiot to relate this topic to scripture. On the means that some people have strong feelings about the bible, and they believe it's true, and the word is true. So if people go by the bible to live life ( Try to) Then they'd come across something that relates to this topic I don't see any problem with sharing it. Alot of people may disagree, but I think it's a very good piece of argument. Except the fact that not everyone is Christian. Therefore not everyone believes the bible. Yet that goes back to the whole *Counter argument thing* which is very smart.\n I'm in a better mood tonight, so I can think a lot better hehe.. -Moonemoticon_zzzz",

   "Alright, time for me to weigh in on the Abortion forums. I am personally Pro-choice. By this, I mean I support a woman's right to control the use of her body, whether she wants to get an abortion or not. From what I've seen of Jitobear, my thoughts are close to hers. I am NOT pro-abortion, in fact I do not like how it is used in many cases, but banning it is NOT the answer. We need to look at the underlying causes of abortion, and thus the underlying causes of unwanted pregnancy, and we need to work to fix THOSE problems if we want abortion rates to fall. I support women's choice whether it is to continue or end her pregnancy.\n \n As far as the foetus, I see it as a recognizable living organism, but NOT as a human, and NOT as a moral equal to living humans. As a pesco-lacto-vegetarian (a vegetarian who eats fish and drinks milk besides the whole vegetarian part as long as the animals used for the milk are treated ethically - I also have no moral problem with the consumption of eggs, but I just happen to not like the taste), I view the foetus on a similar moral level as that of fish (except without the desire to eat them :) ). That is, just as I do not view most fish as sentient, the same goes for foetuses, so they are at a much lower moral level than other animals (cows, dogs, chickens, etc.) including existing humans.\n \n Well, I've rambled on enough - those are my views on this issue.",
