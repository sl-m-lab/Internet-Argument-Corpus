   "THE REBUKE\n \n \n \n Revelation 2:20, \"Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest ( tolerate) that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.\"\n \n \n \n Now with this verse I want you to drop down to verse 23 and see the proof of a great truth I have been bringing to your attention all along. \"And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am He which searcheth the reins and hearts. \" I have been saying right along that there are actually two churches, though the Spirit speaks to both of them in each age, as though they were but one. Here it is plainly stated that there are churches, and it states just as plainly that some of those churches most evidently do NOT know that He is the One Who searcheth the reins and the hearts. He is going to prove to them that is so,. Now then, what churches will be those that do not know this truth? Of course it is the false vine group because the true believers certainly know that judgment begins at the house of God, and they being God-fearing, judge themselves that they be not judged.\n \n Now why does God call these churches His churches even though they are the false vine? The truth of the matter is that they are Christians. But they are not Christians of the Spirit. They are Christians of the flesh. They are bearing the Name in Vain. Mark 7:7, \" Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrine the commandments of men.\" \n But indeed they are Christians for what else could they be?\n \n A Mohammedan is a Mohammedan. That is his religion no matter how he lives it because he subscribes in theory to what the Koran teaches. In the same way a Christian is a christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that Jesus is the Son of God, born of a Virgin, was crucified and died and rose again, that He is the Savior of mankind, ect (In fact, in the Laodicean Age there will be those who call themselves Christians because they subscribe to the fine qualities of Jesus, while reserving to themselves the right ot deny His Deity. Christian Scientist have done that already as well as multitudes who preach a Social Gospel). He is a nominal Christian and belongs to the church. But He is not a TRUE or spiritual believer. That kind of a believer is one who has been baptized into the body of Christ and is a member of Him. But nonetheless, it is in God's order that the tares grow up with the wheat and they are not to be uprooted. That is the command of God. Their day for binding and burning is coming; but not yet.\n \n \n So the spirit is speaking to this mixed group. On the one hand He is praising,and on the other He is rebuking . He has told what is right with the true believer. Now He warns what the false vine must do if it is to stand justified before the Lord\n \n \n THAT WOMAN JEZEBEL\n \n \n \n The apostle James showed us the course that sin takes. James 1:14-15, \" But every man is tempted when he is drawn away of is own lust,and enticed. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth death.\" Now that is a picture of exactly what is happening in the church ages. As sin started in nothing but a feeling, so the death to the church started with the simple , little noticed deeds of the Nicolaitanes. From the deeds it went to a doctrine. From the doctrine it embraced the power of the state and the introduction of paganism. Now in this age it goes to its own prophetess( teacher) and so it travels on until it will find itself in the lake of fire, for that is exactly where it is going to end up, in the second death.\n \n \n Now the whole cry of God against this fourth age is found in His denunciation of this prophetess, Jezebel. And to understand exactly why He denounces her so, we will have to look up her history in the Bible and when we find what she did back there, we will know what is going on at this time.\n \n \n The first and very important thing that we learn about Jezebel is that she is NOT a daughter of Abraham, nor is her induction into the tribes of Israel one of spiritual admission as was that of Ruth, the Moabitess, No sir. This woman was the daughter of Ethbaal, king of Sidon( First Kings 16:31), who was priest unto Astarte. He had gained the throne by murdering his predecessor, Pheles.\n So we see right away that she was the daughter of a murderer( This certainly reminds us of Cain) And the way she became a part of Israel was not through spiritual channels that God had ordained for Gentile admission; but she came in by MARRIAGE to Ahab, the king of the ten tribes of Israel. Now this union as we have seen was not Spiritual; it was political. And so this woman who was steeped in idolatry did not have the least desire to become a worshipper of the One True God, but rather she came with the avowed intentions of turning Israel away from the Lord. Now Israel( the ten tribes) had already known what it was to worship the golden calves, but as yet they were not sold out to idolatry, for God was worshipped and the law of Moses was acknowledged. But from the time of Ahab's marriage to Jezebel, idolatry progressed in a deadly fashion. It was when this woman became a priestess in the temples that she erected to Astarte( Venus) and Baal( sun god) that Israel came to the crisis point of her life.\n \n \n With this in mind we can now begin to see what the Spirit of God is setting forth in this Thyatirean Age. Here it is.\n \n \n Ahab married Jezebel and he did he it as a political maneuver to strengthen his kingdom and secure it. That is exactly what the chuch did when it married under Constatine . They both got together for political reasons, though they put a spiritual air to it. Now no one can convince me that Constantine was a Christian. He was a pagan with what looked like Christian trappings. He painted white crosses on the soldiers' shields. He was the originator of the Knights of Columbus. He put a cross on the steeple of St. Sophia's thereby starting a tradition.\n \n \n It was Constatines's idea to get everyone together, the pagans, nominal Christians and true Christian. And for awhile it looked as if he would succeed for the real believers came along to see if they could bring back the ones that had drifted away from the Word. When they saw that they couldn't bring them back in the truth, they were forced to break away from the body political . Then when they did, they were called heretics and persecuted\n \n Let me say right here that we have the very same thing going on right now. The people are all coming together. They are writing a Bible that will suit everyone whether it be a Jew, Catholic or Protestant. They have their own Nicene Council but they call it the Ecumenical Council . And do you know whom all these organizations fight? They fight the true Pentecostal because they are filled with the Holy Ghost and have the signs and gifts in their midst because they walk in the truth\n \n When Ahab married Jezebel for political reasons he sold his birthright. You join with an organization and you sell your birthright, brother, whether, you want to believe it or not. Every Protestant group that ever came out and then went back sold their birthright, and when you sell your birthright, you're just like Esau- you can cry and repent all you want, but it won't do you any good. There is only one thing you can do that is , \"Come out of her, my people, and stop partaking of her sins!\" Now if you don't think I am right, just answer this one question. Can any man living tell me what church or what move of God ever had revival and came back after she went into organization and became a denomination ? Read your histories. You can't find one - not even one.\n \n \n It was the midnight hour for Israel when she joined with the world and left the Spiritual for the political . It was the midnight hour at Nicea when the church did the same thing. It is the midnight hour now that the churches are coming together.\n \n Now when Ahab married JEZEBEL HE ALLOWED her to take the state money and erect two huge houses of worship of Astarte and Baal. The one that was erected for Baal was big enough for all Israel to come and worship thereat. And when Constantine and the church married he gave the church buildings, and set up altars and images, and organized the hierarchy that had already been shaping up.\n \n \n \n \n When Jezebel got the power of the state behind her she forced her religion on the people and killed the prophets and priests of God. It got so bad that Elijah, the messenger to his day, thought he was the only one left; but God had 7000 more that hadn't bowed the knee to Baal. And right now out there amongst those denominations of Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterians, etc., there are some that will come out and come back to God . I want you to know I am not , now, and never have been against the people. It is the denomination- the system of organization that I am against. I have to be against if for God hates it.\n \n Now just let us stop a minute here ad rehearse what we brought out about the worship inThyatira. . I said that they worshipped Apollo( who was the sun god) along with the emperor. Now this Apollo was called the \"averter of evil.\" He turned evil away from people. He blessed them and was a real god to them. He was suppose to teach the people. He explained about worship, and temple rites, services to gods, about sacrifices and death and life after death. THEY WAY HE DID THIS WAS THROUGH A PROPHETESS WHO SAT ENTRANCED UPON A TRIPOD chair. My! Do you see it? Here is that prophetess called Jezebel and she is teaching the people. And her teaching is seducing the servants of God and causing them to commit fornication. Now fornication mean's 'idol worship'. That is what its spiritual meaning is, It is an illegal union. Ahab's union and Constantine's union were both illegal. Both committed spiritual fornication. Every fornicator will wind up in the lake of fire. God said so. \n \n \n Now then, the teaching of the Catholic Church( the church is female, it is a woman) denies the Word of God. The Pope who is literally Apollo in a modern version has taught the people to join themselves to idols. The Roman Church has now become a false prophetess to the people because she has taken away the Word of the Lord from the people and given her own ideas as to what constitutes forgiveness of sins, what brings the blessings of God; and the priests have gone so far as to state categorically that they have power not only in life but in death. They teach on their own that there is a purgatory, but you can't find that in the Word. They teach that prayers and masses and money will get you out of purgatory and into heaven. The whole system that is based upon its teaching is false. It does not lie on the sure foundation of the revelation of God in His Word but lies on the shifting, sinking, sands of its own diabolical untruths..",

   "The church went right from organization to denomination and hence to false teaching. That is right. The Roman Catholics don't believe that God is in His Word. NO sir. If they did they would have to repent and back up, but they say God is in His church. That would make the Bible the history of the Catholic Church. That isn't so. Look what they did to water baptism alone. They took it away from being Christian Baptism and made it a pagan one of titles. Let me tell you about an experience I had with a Catholic priest. A girl that I had baptized at one time turned Catholic, so the priest wanted to interview me about her. He asked what kind of baptism she had. I told him I baptized her in Christian Baptism which is the only kind there was to my knowledge. I had buried her in water in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The priest remarked to me that at one time the Catholic Church did that,. Right away I asked him when the Catholic Church did that, for I have read their histories and I could not find what he said. He told me that it was found in the bible, and that Jesus has organized the Catholic Church. I asked him if he taught Peter was really the first Pope. He emphatically said that Peter was. I asked him if the masses were said in Latin in order to insure that they were correct and would never change. He said that was true. I told him that I thought they had wandered a long way from what they had in the beginning. I let him know that if the Catholic Church really believed the Book of Acts, then I was on old-fashioned Catholic. He told me that the Bible was in the record of the Catholic Church and that God was in the Church. I disagreed with him for God is in His Word. Let God be true but every man a liar. It you take away or add to that Book, God promised that He will add plagues to those who add and take away thier part from the Book of Life if they dare to subtract from it. REVELATIONS 22:18,19\n \n \n Let me just show how the Roman Catholic Church believes that God is in the church instead of the Word. Here is an excerpt from the diary of Pope John the 23rd.\n \" My experience during these three years as Pope, since \" in fear and trembling' I accepted this service in pure obedience to the Lord's will, conveyed to me through the Sacred College of Cardinals in conclave, bears witness to this maxim and is a moving and lasting reason of me to be true to it; absolute trust in God, in all that concerns the present, and perfect tranquility as regards the future.\"This pope states that God spoke through the church revealing His will. How false. God is in His Word and speaks by the Word revealing His will. He also stated that he placed absolute trust in the word of men and thereby obeyed it with tranquility. It sounds so beautiful but it is so false. Just like the perversion in the Garden of Eden.\n \n \n \n Now let us get over here in Revelation 17 and see this woman, the church, who is living on false prophecies and not the Word of God. In verse1 God calls her the great whore. Why is she a whore? Because she is in idolatry.\n She has caught the people up into the same thing. What's the cure for idolatry? The Word of God. So this woman is a whore because she has left the Word.There she is sitting upon many waters, which means multitudes of people.This surely has to be the false church because the church ot God is small- few there be that find it.\n \n \n Notice what she is like in the eye's of God, no matter how wonderful she looks to people and how philosophical she sounds. She is filthy drunk on her fornication's. Now she was drunk with the blood of the martyrs. Just like Jezebel who killed the prophets and priest and destroyed the people of God who would not bow down and worship Baal. And that is exactly what the Catholic Church did. They killed those that would not bow down to the popish rule. Those who wanted the Word of God instead of the words of men were put to death, usually by cruel methods. But this church that dealt in death was dead herself and didn't know it. There was no life in her and no signs ever followed her.\n \n SPACE TO REPENT\n \n Revelation 2:21, \" And I gave her space to repent of her fornication's; and she repented not.\" Do you know that this church was actually more wicked than Ahab? Do you know that he repented for awhile and walked softly before God? You can't say that of the Roman Catholic Church. No sir. She has never repented but has stubbornly destroyed any and all who tried to help her repent. That is history. Now God kept raising up not only the messengers to each age but He raised up some wonderful helpers of those messengers. He gave every age some wonderful men of God and they did everything they could to bring the church back to God. God certainly gave her opportunity and help to repent. Did she ever repent and show she did by her fruits? No sir. She never has and she never will. She is drunk. She has lost her senses in spiritual things.\n \n \n \n Now don't be confused and start thinking that the Church of Rome has repented of her slaughter of the saints because she is attempting to unite with the Protestants by making her creeds to line up with Protestant Creeds. Not once has she ever apologized and said she was wrong for her mass murders. And she won't either. And no matter how mellow and sweet she appears at this particular time, she will yet rise up to kill, for murder lies in her evil and unrepentant heart.\n \n \n SENTENCE AGAINST THE HARLOT PASSED\n \n \n Revelation 2:22-23, \"Behold I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am He Which searcheith the reins and hearts, and I will give unto everyone of you according to your works.\"\n \n \n \n What? This woman has children? And she a whore? If that is the case that she had children by her whoredoms then she must be burnt with fire as the Word has said. That is exactly true. That is her end for she will burn with fire. Her end is the lake of fire. But stop and think about these children for a moment . A woman is the one out of whom the chidden come. It is evident that this woman had children that came out of her but they did the same thing she did. Show me one church that ever came out of organization that didn't go right back into it. There isn't one. Not one. The Lutherans came out and then organized right back and today they are hand in glove with this ecumenical move. The Methodists came out and they organized right back. The Pentecostals came out and they organized right back.There is going to be another coming out, ands praise God they won't organize back because they know the truth. That group will be the Bride of the last day.\n \n \n Now it said here that this whore had children. Now what were they? They were daughters, for they were churches just like her. Now here is a very interesting point. Jezebel and Ahab had a daughter. That daughter married Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat and in Second Kings 8:16 it says that\" Jehoram walked in the ways of his father-in-law.\" He went right into idolatry by this marriage. He brought God-fearing and God-worshipping Judah into idolatry. That is exactly what all these daughter churches have done, even as I have pointed out to you.They started in the truth and marry into organization and leave the Word for tradition, creeds ect. Now let me get this across. In Hebrews 13:7 it says, \"Obey them which have rule over you who have spoken to you the Word of God.\" It is the Word that rules us, not men. Now a man as a husband is head of the woman. He rules her. But the church is a woman, too, and her ruler is the Word. Jesus is the Word. If she rejects the Word and takes any other headship she is an adulteress. Word for traditions and creeds. They are all adulteresses-like mother, like daughter.\n \n \n What will be the punishment of the harlot and her children? Well, it is going to be twofold. First he saids, \" I will cast her into a bed.\" According to the last part of verse 22 it will be a bed of tribulation , or the great tribulation. That is exactly what Jesus said in Matthew 25:1-13. There were ten virgins. Five were wise and five were foolish. The five wise had oil( the Holy Spirit) but the other five did not.\n When the cry went up, \" Behold the Bridegroom comet,\" the five foolish had to run seeking oil while the five wise virgins went into the marriage. The five that remained outside were left to the great tribulation. That is what will happen to all who do not go up in the raptue.That is what will come upon the harlot and her daughters. Secondly, it says that he will kill them with death or as a literal translation says,\" Let them be put to death by death.\" This is a strange saying. We might say, \" let a man be put death by hanging , or by electrocution or some other way.\" But this says, \" Let them be put to death by death.\" Death itself is the cause of their death. Now I want you to see this clearly so I will take our illustration again of the daughter of Jezebel marrying into the house of Judah and thereby bringing it right into idolatry and causing God to deliver Judah to death. That is what Balaam did, too. So here was Jezebel with her paganism. Over there is Judah properly worshipping God and living under the Word. So Jezebel marries her daughter to Jehoram. The minute that marriage took place Judah was dead. Spiritual death came in. The minute the first church of Rome organized, death came in and they died. The minute that the Lutherans organized, death came in and they died. The Pentecostals came along last and they organized. The Spirit left, though they don't believe it. But He did. That marriage brought death. Then the light of Oneness of the Godhead came. They organized and they died too. Then after the fire of God fell on the Ohio River in 1933 a healing revival swept the world, but it never came through any organization.\n God went outside the Pentecostal groups, outside of organization, and what He is going to do in the future is going to be outside organization, and what He is going to do in the future is going to be outside organization, too. God can 't work through the dead. He can only work through the LIVING members. Those living members are outside of Babylon.\n \n \n \n So you see, \" Death\" or \" Organization\" came , and the church died, or to make it plainer death became a resident wherein shortly before only Life reigned. As the original Eve brought death to mankind so now organization has brought death, for organization is the product of the double corrupters, Nicolaitnism and Balaamism, propagated by the prophetess Jezebel. Now Eve should have been burned along with the serpent for their awful deed. But Adam intervened, taking her quickly to himself so that she was saved. But when this Satanic religion has gone the full course of the ages, there will be no one to intervene, and she will be burned with her seducer, for the whore and her children and the anti christ and Satan will all find their places in the lake of fire.\n \n \n  William Branham",

   "Right here I will be getting ahead of myself and maybe I ought to reserve this for the message on the last age, but it seems just right to put it in now because it deals so clearly with organization and what is going to happen through it .And I want to warn. Revelation 13: 1-18, \" And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, ands upon his heads the name of blasphemy. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion; and the dragon gave him him power, and his seat and great authority. And I saw one of his heads as if it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast. And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast, and they worshipped the beast saying , Who is like unto the beast:? Who is able to make war with him? And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months. And he opended his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, and His tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth shalll worship him, whose names ae not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If any man have ear, let him hear. He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints. And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earh; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon,. And he exerciseth all the power of them which dwell therin to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down form heaven on the earth in the sight of men. And he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six humdred three score and six.\"\n \n This chapter shows the power of the Roman Catholic Church and what she will do throgh organization. Remember this is the false vine. Let it name the Name of the Lord, it does so onlly in a lie. Its headship is not of the Lord but of Satan. If finally ends up completely identified with the beast. The whore riding on the scarlet beast distinctly shows her power is the god of force( Satan) and not our God, the Lord Jesus Christ.\n \n \n \n In verse 17, it emphatically shows that she will gain absolute control of the commerce of the earth , for no man can buy or sell apart from her. This is borne out in REVELATION 18:9-17 which shows her involvement with kings, princes, mechants, all of whom have to do with Rome and commerce.\n \n \n \n In Revelation 13:14, we learn that the beast spreads his influence through the image which was built for him. The image that is made is a world-wide ecumenical council, wherein all the organized churches will get together with the Romand Catholics( they are doing it even now.) It is quite possible this union will come in order to stop the power of Communism. But since communism like Nebuchadnessar has been raised up to burn the flesh of the harlot, Rome will be overcome and destroyed.Take note that everywhere the Romish churdh went, communism followed. It has to that way. And let me warn you now, don't get thinking communism is your only enemy. No sir. It is the Catholic Church also , and even more so\n \n \n Now let us read Revelation 13:1-4, and compare this with Revelation 12:1-5. Revelation 13:1-4, 'And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his dead the name of blasphemy. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion; and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat and great authority. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast,. And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? Who is able to make war with him? Revelation 12;1-5, \" And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed wih the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered. And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and it cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, to devour her child as soon as it was born. And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to His throne.\" Satan and his Sataniic religion are in both of these beast. In Revelation 14, the beast that was wounded unto death but live again is Imperial pagan Rome that fell to the onslaught of the barbarians and thereby lost the temporal power. But she regained it in papal Rome. Do you see it? The nation that ruled by crushing all and which became the strongest empire ever known, was finally wounded to death . Her power was gone physically as to control by armies etc. But under Constantine she came back to life, for papal Rome has infiltrated the whole word, and her power is absolute. She used kings and merchants and in her deadly religious and finanicial strenght she is governing as the goddess of this present age. She is also the dragon that stood waiting to devour the man child. Herod tried to kill the Lord Jesus and failed. Later Jesus was crucified by Roman soldiers, but now is caught up to the throne\n \n \n Now along with what I have just said, recall the vision of Daniel. The last part of the image, the last world power was in the feet. That was iron and clay. See the iron is the ROMAN Empire. But now it is no longer solid iron. Clay is mixed in it. Yet it is there and running world affairs in both the democratic nations and the more depotic ones. The Romish church is in every nation. It is mixed up in it all.\n \n Let me give you a little something on the iron and clay. Remeber when Khrushchev beat his shoe on the desk at the U.N.? Well, there were five eastern nations there and five western. Khrushchev spoke for the East and President Eisenhower for tthe West. In Russian, Khrushchev is clay and Eisen hower means iron. The two main leaders of the world, the two big toes of the feet of iron and clay, were side by side,. We are in the end of it now\n \n \n In verse 4, it asks, \" Who is able to make war with the beast?\" Now there are at present some great names in the world . There are some mighty nations , but right now Rome is calling the tune. The pope is in the driver's seat.And his power is going to increase. No one can war against him.\n \n \n \n \n Verse 6, \"And he opened his mough in blas-phemy.\" (Teaching for doctrine the commandments of men, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure, having a form of godlinesss and denying the power therof.) He blasphemed the Name of God-changing that Name to titles and refusing to do otherwise.\n Verse 7, \"And it was given unto him to make war with the saints.\" Persecution-death to the true believer and all in the Name of the Lord in order that the Name of God be blasphemed, even as it is in Russia, because of what the Catholic religion did there.\n \n \n Thank God the sheep will not worship him. Everyone but the very elect will be deceived. But they will not be deceived. For they hear the Shepard's voice and they follow Him\n \n \n \n Now then, see this , what we have been trying to show you . This seed of death that started in the first age- this seed of organization, has finally grown into the tree in which every foul bird is lodged. In spite of her claims that she is the giver of life, she is the giver of death. Her fruit is DEATH. They that partake of her are dead. This mighty world church system that fools the world that in her is physical snd spirtual salvation deceives and destroys the multitudes. But not only is she death personified, but this dead carrion creature will be itself put to death with death which is the lake of fire. Oh, that men would perceive what their end will be by remaining in her.\" Come out of her, for why will ye die?\n \n \n A FINAL WARNING\n \n \n \n \n Revelation 2:23, \" And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am He which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.\"\n \n \n \n God looketh on the heart. That has never changed.Neither will it ever change. Here, as through all the ages there are two groups, both proclaiming their revelation from God and their relationship to God. \"Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knowth them which are His.\" Second Timothy, 2:19. \"The Lord searcheth the reins.\"The word 'search' means to 'track' or 'follow up.'. God tracks down our thoughts(reins); He knows what is in our hearts. He sees our works which are a definite manifestation of what lies within us. It is out of the heart that proceeds either righteousness or wickedness. Our motives, our purposes-all are known unto Him as He watches every action.\n And every action, every word shall be brought into judgment when the accounting for our lives is given. There was no fear of God before the false vine and dearly shall they pay. Let all who name His Name, so live as becometh saints. We might fool the people but we will never fool the Lord.",

I find that most churchs pick what they want from the Bible and ignore the rest. The R.C.C. appears to want worship of itself rather than pointing the people towards God.\n\n \n Rapture, \n Again, you are either ignoring things purposefully or unable to comprehend. I did not say that men are equal to God. You cannot find this anywhere in my posts. Epaphras attempted to explain that to you.\n \n You need to study your Bible. Play along with me here and pay close attention.\n \n Get out your Bible and read the verses I am about to supply and you will learn a few things about calling men \"father.\"\n \n The old admonition taken from Jesus' words in the Gospel of Matthew, \"Call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven\" is usually the basis for an attack on the Church for calling men father. But this can be easily reconciled when reads the numerous other verses that use the word father...\n \n Luke 16:24, Jesus speaking of the rich man's appeal to Abraham, \"Father Abraham, have mercy upon me...\" Why would Jesus quote this man, calling another \"father\" if he had outlawed this practice? \n \n In Acts 7:1-2 Stephen said, \"Brethren and fathers, hear me.\" \n \n In Romans 4:1-18, Paul calls Abraham father 7 times. \n \n 1 Corinthians 4:14-15  Paul refers to himself as a father, \"For though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel.\" \n \n Ephesians 6:4, \"Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger...\" \n \n James 2:21, \"Was not Abraham our father...\" \n \n 1 John 2:13, \"I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.\" \n \n This illustrates that Christ's admonition was to prevent us from violating the commandment of having other gods before the one God. He was trying to prevent us from looking to a human as a father in the way that only God can be our father. Many overlook the above verses though.\n \n Would you have the courage to tell Paul, Stephen, James, John, and Jesus himself to change their words? The words of Scripture?\n \n Or perhaps we could approach the issue from another angle if HOLY SCRIPTURE does not suffice. Read the admonition of Jesus again in Matthew 23. Three words are prohibited, not just one. Father, teacher/rabbi, and master are prohibited. \"...and they love...and being called rabbi by men. But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brethren. And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven...He who is greatest among you shall be your servant; whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.\" This passage is about humility and our one Godly Father. But what about the word teacher? How many times have you used this word, in your articles, in your personal conversations? Does Christ tell us not to call any man teacher just as we are not to call man father? Do you know anyone who will not use the word teacher? Perhaps the practice of using the word father is attacked because it is a solely because of its \"Catholicity.\"",

There will is not mentioned as requirement for the Bible, yet we know these men and that they were glad to serve the will of God.\n\n \n Lappster,\n That is a nice scripture quote. But it does not speak to the debate between rapture and me.\n \n He said that the practice of Catholics calling priests father was unchristian and unscriptural. I showed him that the practice was, in fact, very Christian as the earliest Christians did it. I showed him that the practice was very scriptural as abundant examples of it can be found in scripture. \n \n After ignoring the scripture I cited he then attempted to turn his argument into \"there is no explicit command in the Bible telling people to call men father.\" We would not be doing quite a few good and right things if we needed an explicit command in the Bible for them all.\n \n I responded with the fact that there is no explicit command by Jesus telling his apostles to write the Bible. There is none. Your citation states that men were inspired by the Holy Spirit. I believe that. The Holy Spirit inspires many things, including the inspiration to speak the good news as the verse from Peter states. I'm glad they were moved to speak and write.\n \n (This is not to mention the absurdly false charge rapture made against Catholics stating that we believe that God is not in the Word. When I challenged him to produce evidence of this teaching he balked).",
