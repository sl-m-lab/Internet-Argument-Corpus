   "I'll let the prosecutor speak for himself.\n =================================\n Agence France-Presse, by Staff \n From correspondents in Rotterdam\n \n \n May 03, 2005\n \n Rotterdam - Mohammed Bouyeri, the man accused of the murder of filmmaker Theo van Gogh, played ''a leading role'' in an Islamic terrorist organisation dubbed the Hofstad group, a prosecutor said in a procedural hearing on the group on Tuesday. /break/ ''Bouyeri took literature from the Internet which preached and glorified the use of violence. He himself wrote articles in which he advocated the use of deadly violence.''\n \n (Snip)\n \n The 12, all young Muslims mainly of North-African descent, were arrested in November and December last year after the brutal murder of Van Gogh in an Amsterdam street.\n \n Police say the alleged killer, Mr Bouyeri, acted out of radical Islamic beliefs. A letter found pinned to Van Gogh's body contained quotations from the Koran and threats to liberal lawmaker Ayaan Hirsi Ali, known for her criticism of Islam...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,15170246-38200,00.html",

Can't you for once be a serious person?\n \n Is it my fault that he's a Muslim? If you know of any Christian fundamentalists who are into terrorism, please make them known. I'm not talking about wackjobs like Eric Rudolph but actual religious fanatics who would do something like this. Produce them if you can. And I'll condemn them as well.",

That's the essense of Whabbism which is the official state religion of Saudi Arabia. As I understand it it takes the form of a literal reading of the Quran. Now I've actually attended Christian funadamentalist churches and I can categorically state that they post no danger to anyone except perhaps themselves.
