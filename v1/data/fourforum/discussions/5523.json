   "Job growth is lowest in almost two years\n Weak performance reflects doubts of employers about economic recovery\n \n \n \n From Wire Reports\n \n June 4, 2005\n \n WASHINGTON - The nation's economy managed tepid job growth in May, with employers creating 78,000 new jobs rather than the expected 175,000, the Labor Department said yesterday.\n \n The disappointing Bureau of Labor Statistics employment report - showing the worst monthly performance since August 2003 - rekindled talk of an economic slowdown as well as speculation that the Federal Reserve might stop raising interest rates sooner than anticipated.\n \n That unsettled investors and helped push stocks lower. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 0.9 percent to 10,460, and the Nasdaq composite index tumbled 1.3 percent to 2,071.\n \n But analysts cautioned that the month-to-month job numbers often bounce wildly and are much less meaningful than the average pace over six months or a year. The reluctance to hire in May was partly the rebound from a torrid pace in April, when employers added 274,000 people to their payrolls, they said.\n \n \"The economy has slowed from its strong pace, but the data have been so strange and volatile that it is unclear what its true condition is,\" said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pa.\n \n Over the past year, the nation has added an average of 180,000 jobs a month. That pace has slowed to about 158,000 jobs a month since February, a trend that economists say is in line with other indicators of slower but continued economic growth.\n \n If anything, the report highlighted the erratic and often sluggish job growth. Last month was the first time that the number of private-sector jobs rebounded to exceed the number that existed when the recession began in March 2001.\n \n \"Underlying the jagged nature of monthly job growth over recent months is employers' unwillingness to shed their caution regarding the strength of the recovery,\" said Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center research group in Washington.\n \n Job growth stalled in retailing, temporary-help agencies, leisure services, and business and professional services. All had been big sources of new employment over the past year.\n \n Manufacturing companies shed 7,000 jobs in May and have eliminated 67,000 jobs since August. The results highlighted what has apparently become a permanent decline in factory employment as a result of rising productivity and increased \"outsourcing\" of production to China and other low-wage countries.\n \n Manufacturers have sharply scaled back expectations, partly in response to problems at General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. The Institute for Supply Management's monthly barometer of manufacturing activity dropped in May to its lowest level in two years and is close to a level associated with a contraction in production.\n \n Only a few industries added significant numbers of workers. One was health care, a sector that has been expanding faster than the overall economy for years. It added 26,000 jobs.\n \n The other big area was residential home construction, which added 20,000 jobs in May and provided further evidence of the economy's dependence on a housing boom.\n \n Many economists cautioned against interpreting the soft May report as signaling the start of a slowdown in the U.S. job market, saying that job creation has been extremely erratic for the past several months.\n \n Behind the recent month-to-month volatility, said CSFB economist Jay Feldman, job creation by employers is \"solid, though not spectacular.\"\n \n When the jobs report is put alongside other recent economic data, \"you get sort of this mosaic that suggests the economy is doing pretty decently,\" said Bill Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock Financial Services in Boston.\n \n Indeed, using data compiled from a separate survey, the Labor Department also reported yesterday that the U.S. unemployment rate inched down last month, from 5.2 percent to 5.1 percent, even as greater numbers of people entered the work force. That's the lowest jobless level since September 2001.\n \n The Labor Department's other measure of job growth - the household survey, which is based on interviews at about 60,000 homes - showed a surge of 360,000 jobs in May and nearly 600,000 jobs in April.\n \n Most analysts, including those at the Federal Reserve, consider the household survey less reliable than the so-called \"establishment\" survey, which is based on data from 400,000 work sites.\n \n Hourly wages for production and non-supervisory workers climbed about 3 cents an hour, to $16.03, and have risen about 2.6 percent in the past year.\n \n That was less than the rate of inflation, suggesting that workers still have limited bargaining power. But overall employment costs are rising more rapidly, partly because of rising costs for health insurance and other fringe benefits and partly because of increased hiring.\n \n On Thursday, the Labor Department estimated that unit labor costs, the cost of labor to produce a dollar's worth of production, climbed 3.3 percent in the first quarter. \n Copyright \u00a9 2005, The Baltimore Sun",

The Homeless\n \n Copyright 2001 Jason Manning All Rights Reserved \n Tramps, bums, drifters, grate people -- no matter what the pejorative label, there seemed to be a lot of homeless people on urban streets in the 1980s. Estimates of their number ranged from 300,000 to three million. (It is probable that on any given night there were 700,000 people in the U.S. without shelter, while a quarter of a million roamed the streets as \"hardcore\" homeless.) As the decade progressed, more and more Americans became aware of the plight of the displaced persons, so that by 1988 a majority of those polled believed the homeless to be a top priority, not to mention a national disgrace. But homelessness proved to be an intractable problem. Debate swirled not only over how to solve the problem but also as to who or what was responsible for the problem in the first place.\n \n Many experts pointed to the \"deinstitutionalizing\" of patients in mental hospitals that occurred in the Sixties and Seventies as part of the problem. In the early 1960s, days of heady and high-minded social reform, the decision was made to begin closing the \"snake pits\" -- mental hospitals -- and to create a new system of local mental health centers. To that end, President John F. Kennedy signed the Community Mental Health Centers Act in 1963. It was hoped that new wonder drugs would enable many patients to function once they were reintroduced into society. The result: the number of patients in state mental hospitals declined from over 500,000 in 1960 to 150,000 twenty years later. But community-based services were not adequate to take up the slack; by 1988 it was estimated that most of the nation's largest cities had no more than 10% of the institutional placements necessary for the mentally ill.\n \n Where, then, did the mentally ill go? By the mid-Eighties, reliable studies revealed that about one-third of the homeless fell into this category. Some were former mental hospital patients while the rest were younger mentally ill individuals who had never received institutional care. And the other two-thirds of the homeless? According to Dr. Irwin Perr of the Rutgers Medical School, the conventional wisdom was that 25-50% had alcohol or drug abuse problems. The rest were the \"new poor\" -- the jobless or those displaced by the gentrification of inner city areas. The number in low-income families unable to find affordable housing rose from 8.9 million in 1974 to 11.9 million in 1983. In New York City, tax abatements in the early '80s encouraged developers to replace flophouses with luxury condominiums. Similar urban policies had the same effect across the nation. Restrictions on the sale and rent rates of subsidized federal housing, approved in the 1960s, were expiring. Between 1974 and 1983, according to Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies, nearly 900,000 SRO (single-occupancy units) that rented for less than $200/month were lost. The number of SROs in New York fell by 89%, from 127,000 to 14,000. Where once the ranks of the homeless were dominated by single men, now at least a third were families without homes, often unwed mothers with small children.\n \n The Reagan administration was slow to acknowledge the problem, much less respond constructively to it. In 1981, the federal government's Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program was designed to deliver surplus agricultural products to the needy. But by 1986 it was clear that almost none of this food was actually getting to the homeless. The president was chastised by activists when he stated that most street people were in that situation because they chose to be. Presidential Counsellor Edwin Meese claimed that people went to soup kitchens because they didn't want to pay for their meals. Reagan and Meese were clearly mistaken; the majority of the homeless did not choose or prefer their fate -- a life of little sleep, little food, and precious little social interaction. \"I'm getting to the point where I can't talk to people,\" admitted a Philadelphia homeless man named Red. Violence was a fact of life; nearly every homeless person would be beaten, robbed or raped at least once. In some cities, the police rousted the homeless out of public parks and subway systems.\n \n A proliferation of panhandlers complicated the issue. In 1988, New York City Mayor Ed Koch launched a crusade to rid the sreets of an estimated 5,000 beggars. \"Many people who panhandle just don't want to work for a living,\" insisted Koch. They were con artists and addicts, said the mayor, and they were becoming a menace to decent folk. (In Seattle, a man was beaten to death after spurning a panhandler, prompting the city to ban \"aggressive begging,\" with violators facing 90 days in jail and a $500 fine.) Some social workers agreed with Koch, claiming that relatively few of those who begged needed the money for a legitimate reason. They argued also that if people stopped giving to panhandlers it would force those who needed alcohol and drug treatment to seek professional help. Some of the truly needy complained that panhandlers were making things even more difficult for them. \"Most panhandlers are phony,\" said a Vietnam vet named Jerome, who had lost a leg in the war and asked for donations from passersby at Manhattan's Pennsylvania Station. \"They're drug addicts, drunks, bums or punks who don't want to work.\" In Los Angeles, Jeffrey Allman and Tracy Hartland, the so-called \"Yuppie Panhandlers,\" were arrested in August 1988 and charged with 22 counts of theft for conning people in supermarket parking lots, bringing in up to $200-an-hour. Both were aspiring actors who managed a West Hollywood building and lived in a rent-free apartment.\n \n Such stories hardened many hearts towards those who were really in need. In Los Angeles, a member of the county board of supervisors suggested loading all the city's homeless onto a barge anchored in the harbor. In El Paso, Texas, billboards urged people not to give to beggars because it caused traffic problems. And a Ft. Lauderdale, Florida city commissioner wanted to put rat poison in dumpsters to discourage street people from foraging.\n \n The federal government belatedly tried to address the problem. While federal support for subsidized housing had been slashed from $32 billion in 1981 to $7.5 billion in 1988, the Reagan administration sought to subsidize low-rent tenants with cash vouchers given directly to the poor. But that didn't always help in a nation where housing prices had increased nearly 50% in less than a decade; even with vouchers many poor families couldn't find affordable shelter. Reagan then signed the MicKinney Homeless Assistance Act, which authorized $1 billion in aid over two years. The 1986 tax reform package offered corporations a tax credit for investments in low-income housing. And in 1988 the president signed the Housing and Community Development Act, which assisted 152,000 needy families and called for the renovation of 10,000 public housing units. In addition, Congress appropriated over $200 million in the mid-Eighties to be dispersed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. These were steps in the right direction, but didn't provide nearly enough funding to have a significant impact. A study suggested the country would need 7.5 million new low-income housing units by the year 2000; estimated cost: $300 billion. Faced by record budget deficits, the administration hoped supply-side economics would provide cities and states with more funds to finance their own remedies. It was largely left up to local governments, churches and community groups, and private citizens to make a difference.\n \n By easing building codes and providing development loans, San Diego inspired the construction of five new SRO hotels. In New York City, an $80 million project to build 1,000 low-income apartments was launched; $25 million of the cost was raised by corporations. (In all, New York City would spend $500 million to help the homeless in 1988; the only problem was that an estimated $12 billion more was needed.)The Chicago Equity Fund, a consortium of Fortune 500 companies, provided capital for similar projects in the Windy City. Activists in that city (and others) negotiated with landlords to prevent evictions, and acquired rent loans. Washington DC's Zacchaeus Medical Clinic was funded entirely by church and community groups as well as individual donors. In Los Angeles, the \"Village Concept\" had mental health workers riding a weekly circuit to visit patients in sublet apartments, and the city built its first public shelter in 1985 -- right across the street from Thieves Corner, where the homeless had slept on discarded couches and car seats. The citys SRO Housing Corporation bought up 11 skid-row hotels for $12 million. In the nation's capital, outspoken activist Mitch Snyder, director of the DC Community for Creative Non-Violence, got a referendum passed that made the city responsible for guaranteeing \"adequate overnight shelter\" for all who could not afford it. A Massachusetts law changed the rules to allow welfare payments to people without permanent addresses. New Jersey paid delinquent rents to prevent the eviction of 8,000 families in 1987. The Metropolitan Inter-Faith Association of Memphis leased foreclosed HUD properties for $1 a year -- and made sure that each tenant family was provided with essentials, including a telephone to facilitate job-hunting.\n \n But other localities took an entirely different approach. In Phoenix, the preferred destination of many out-of-work Northerners, three soup kitchens and ten welfare hotels were closed or torn down. The Chamber of Commerce distributed anti-homeless bumper stickers, showing a big slash through the silhouette of a person sleeping on a park bench. And in Greenwich Village, barbed wire was strung over hot-air grates to prevent the homeless from sleeping on them.\n \n There were some who argued that the effort to find housing for the homeless was, as Time Magazine's David Whitman put it, \"as effective as a Band-Aid on a bullet wound.\" The real need was to rehabilitate, not warehouse, displaced persons. Job training and psychiatric counseling would do more to solve the problem in the long run. Dr. Rodger Farr opened a skid row mental health clinic in Los Angeles, dispatching teams of dedicated social workers to seek out those in need of help. Farr knew you had to take that help to the homeless, who were often too disoriented, too ill or simply too afraid to go in search of it. The non-profit Community Occupational Readiness and Placement Program (CORPP) in Philadelphia provided homeless men and women with an 11-week job training program; in the process, CORPP sought to establish a peer-support group, necessary because most of the homeless were isolated, without friends, family or church to turn to in times of crisis. Street people needed a support system most of all. As Sister Marie Sullivan of Atlanta's Christian Emergency Help Centers put it, \"Somebody who is homeless has lost everything.\" Not just a home. \n Mother and child in a homeless shelter, Dallas, 1986.\n \n \n \n \n Death in the Cities\n The press played its part in publicizing the homeless crisis, often focusing on the tragic suffering of street people during the winter months. It was pointed out that on the morning Ronald Reagan delivered his second inaugural address -- indoors under the Capitol dome due to inclement winter weather -- a homeless man was found frozen to death in a derelict house just a few miles away. (Inaugural partygoers and caterers donated leftovers to Washington homeless shelters; Waiters in tuxedos from Ridgewell's catering service supplied 1,000 homeless with hams, shrimp, quiche and crab claws.) Three years earlier, a decorated World War II veteran died of exposure on a bench in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House. In Phladelphia, Pittsburgh and other cities, police removed the homeless from the streets when temperatures plummeted to a dangerous level. But when Mayor Koch of New York City -- where nearly 30 displaced persons had perished over the course of several winters -- implemented a similar plan, the New York Civil Liberties Union denounced it as an unconstitutional restraint on personal freedom.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n REFERENCES\n \n The Economist, 25 December 1982, 3 December 1983, 21 December 1985, 7 February 1987, 7 November 1987\n \n Newsweek, 6 January 1986, 21 March 1988, 4 April 1988, 11 April 1988\n \n U.S. News & World Report, 30 January 1984, 29 February 1988\n \n Time, 19 December 1983, 4 February 1985, 2 December 1985, 2 February 1987, 5 September 1988, 24 October 1988\n \n Rachel and Her Children: Homeless Families in America\n Jonathan Kozol (New York: Fawcett Columbine, 1988)",

   "57. The Homeless\n \n Copyright 2001 Jason Manning All Rights Reserved \n Tramps, bums, drifters, grate people -- no matter what the pejorative label, there seemed to be a lot of homeless people on urban streets in the 1980s. Estimates of their number ranged from 300,000 to three million. (It is probable that on any given night there were 700,000 people in the U.S. without shelter, while a quarter of a million roamed the streets as \"hardcore\" homeless.) As the decade progressed, more and more Americans became aware of the plight of the displaced persons, so that by 1988 a majority of those polled believed the homeless to be a top priority, not to mention a national disgrace. But homelessness proved to be an intractable problem. Debate swirled not only over how to solve the problem but also as to who or what was responsible for the problem in the first place.\n \n Many experts pointed to the \"deinstitutionalizing\" of patients in mental hospitals that occurred in the Sixties and Seventies as part of the problem. In the early 1960s, days of heady and high-minded social reform, the decision was made to begin closing the \"snake pits\" -- mental hospitals -- and to create a new system of local mental health centers. To that end, President John F. Kennedy signed the Community Mental Health Centers Act in 1963. It was hoped that new wonder drugs would enable many patients to function once they were reintroduced into society. The result: the number of patients in state mental hospitals declined from over 500,000 in 1960 to 150,000 twenty years later. But community-based services were not adequate to take up the slack; by 1988 it was estimated that most of the nation's largest cities had no more than 10% of the institutional placements necessary for the mentally ill.\n \n Where, then, did the mentally ill go? By the mid-Eighties, reliable studies revealed that about one-third of the homeless fell into this category. Some were former mental hospital patients while the rest were younger mentally ill individuals who had never received institutional care. And the other two-thirds of the homeless? According to Dr. Irwin Perr of the Rutgers Medical School, the conventional wisdom was that 25-50% had alcohol or drug abuse problems. The rest were the \"new poor\" -- the jobless or those displaced by the gentrification of inner city areas. The number in low-income families unable to find affordable housing rose from 8.9 million in 1974 to 11.9 million in 1983. In New York City, tax abatements in the early '80s encouraged developers to replace flophouses with luxury condominiums. Similar urban policies had the same effect across the nation. Restrictions on the sale and rent rates of subsidized federal housing, approved in the 1960s, were expiring. Between 1974 and 1983, according to Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies, nearly 900,000 SRO (single-occupancy units) that rented for less than $200/month were lost. The number of SROs in New York fell by 89%, from 127,000 to 14,000. Where once the ranks of the homeless were dominated by single men, now at least a third were families without homes, often unwed mothers with small children.\n \n The Reagan administration was slow to acknowledge the problem, much less respond constructively to it. In 1981, the federal government's Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program was designed to deliver surplus agricultural products to the needy. But by 1986 it was clear that almost none of this food was actually getting to the homeless. The president was chastised by activists when he stated that most street people were in that situation because they chose to be. Presidential Counsellor Edwin Meese claimed that people went to soup kitchens because they didn't want to pay for their meals. Reagan and Meese were clearly mistaken; the majority of the homeless did not choose or prefer their fate -- a life of little sleep, little food, and precious little social interaction. \"I'm getting to the point where I can't talk to people,\" admitted a Philadelphia homeless man named Red. Violence was a fact of life; nearly every homeless person would be beaten, robbed or raped at least once. In some cities, the police rousted the homeless out of public parks and subway systems.\n \n A proliferation of panhandlers complicated the issue. In 1988, New York City Mayor Ed Koch launched a crusade to rid the sreets of an estimated 5,000 beggars. \"Many people who panhandle just don't want to work for a living,\" insisted Koch. They were con artists and addicts, said the mayor, and they were becoming a menace to decent folk. (In Seattle, a man was beaten to death after spurning a panhandler, prompting the city to ban \"aggressive begging,\" with violators facing 90 days in jail and a $500 fine.) Some social workers agreed with Koch, claiming that relatively few of those who begged needed the money for a legitimate reason. They argued also that if people stopped giving to panhandlers it would force those who needed alcohol and drug treatment to seek professional help. Some of the truly needy complained that panhandlers were making things even more difficult for them. \"Most panhandlers are phony,\" said a Vietnam vet named Jerome, who had lost a leg in the war and asked for donations from passersby at Manhattan's Pennsylvania Station. \"They're drug addicts, drunks, bums or punks who don't want to work.\" In Los Angeles, Jeffrey Allman and Tracy Hartland, the so-called \"Yuppie Panhandlers,\" were arrested in August 1988 and charged with 22 counts of theft for conning people in supermarket parking lots, bringing in up to $200-an-hour.
