The Bill of Rights makes no such statements. Only an ##### would claim that life begins at birth. I understand that you oppose abortion, but it shows a fundamental ignorance of the issue to claim that it has something to do with when life begins. For god's sake, a fresh radish is living, and yet you eat it in you salad (along with the living lettuce, celery, tomato and such).

That system is that abortions are not permitted. And yet, when these children are born, the christian fundamentalists scorn them. They are the poor and the mothers are sinful. Thus, the cycle repeats. The christian idea is to prohibit the abortion and then fail to support the child born in poverty.",

If we are to follow the French for example, they're mired in humanistic ideals - well, rights are subjective, and [frankly] they are paying a heavy price price for it because their constitution grants people rights by the state. People are not the inspiration... the immediate need is, that's a problem because what if the immediate need is to extinguish the voice of reason that could bring balance to a crisis situation? People become pawns then... especially when a self indulgent piece of legislation floats across the floors of the French Parliament, what then? If you are to adopt a strategy as one looking at humanity for what it is, precious and worth defending - you want to adopt a plan that benefits man at his core... not as he is living at the moment. \n \n Thus eliminating subjectivity and finding the core reality that binds a people of all ethnicities, gender and creeds together. Ours was based on our founders faith in a Creator who endowed man with a basic ability to provide, defend and walk this earth without being accosted by ideals or philosophies that say he is anything less that what is plainly evident. To contribute to his/her own well being - to worship as they please without government interference [not the other way around]... and to make a living with using his or hers God given talents, without government interventionism. So the question that goes before Australian people [and I am a huge fan of Prime Minister Howard - BTW] is how to model this bill of rights? After a humanistic model pressing a priority of self gratification over a principled and morally clear model, extolling the virtues self-control, propriety and common sense. That has to be answered first... in all fairness, that is square one. Either principles that have historically empowered and challenged - but [typically] haven't been the most populist or popular by th self indulgent, but have built character, inspired and blessed those who practice them and engage the culture under those principles. Or preferring a system that has been molded [quite conspicuously] out of idealogical expediency - benefiting those living in the now - with no thought toward a tomorrow or the consequences of living in such a manner. Those are the questions for your people to weigh and consider first I would suppose.\n \n Like I said... interesting thoughts and question Holly, you and I don't agree on much - but we don't disagree on much either.\n \n \n -That Darn Republican",

IT turns out that capitalism does not work very well either, and the smart nations are the ones with a mixed system. \n \n \nOur values haven't from day one... why should they now?\n \n \n Huh? Nobody said anything about blending in. \n \n \nOne point you miss in your observation - government is not self-existent, it gets its marching orders from the laws that empower and enable it, not the other way around.\n \n \n It gets power from laws passed by ITSELF. \n \n \nThat is why we have a bill of rights ensuring that a government for and by the people won't get run over by the government that is supposed to protect the people.\n \n \n No, our bill of rights THEORETICALLY protect 10 out of the THOUSANDS of natural rights that were considered inviolate when the constitution was written and has led to a situation where we have ###### believing that \"our right\" are protected by the bill of rights when, in fact, we were meant to have many, many more rights. \n \n \nOur laws are formed by morality tests included in the Federalist papers... how could we hold contracts binding if there were no clearly binding principles enforcing adjudication if needed. No... there had to be a morally clear position with biblical principles at the root because they are not biased - not the moral opacity we observe from humanism, which is subjective period. Our laws are not secular by nature that is the problem the far left has... because behavioral opportunism has been bested by moral clarity and they want no part of it.\n\n \n Sorry, but the concept of legally enforceable contracts predates Christianity. In fact, Christianity almost killed the concept. During the reign of the catholic church as a world power only contracts made with the church or the king were considered binding. Anything else was more or less considered a gentlemans agreement and as such unenforceable. It was not until the crusades, when we had to deal with muslims, that the church changed their policies re: legally binding contracts for the masses because crusaders found it impossible to deal with the muslims without them. \n \n What exactly do you disagree with? Do you disagree that Americans considered FAR more things to be \"rights\" when the bill of rights was drafted? Do you disagree that most of the things that were considered \"rights\" under common law at the time are no longer considered as such? Do you disagree that the government has moved FAR outside the powers grated to it by the constitution??",

   "\n That isn't true - it is not a debt suspense note like the US dollar. It is back predominately by precious metals and hasn't moved from that. \n\n \n No it isnt. You have no idea what you are talking about.\n \n From the Bank of Englands web page:\n \n Bank of England|Banknotes|More About Banknotes|Banknote FAQs\n \n \nThe words \"I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of five [ten/twenty/fifty] pounds\" date from long ago when our notes represented deposits of gold. At that time, a member of the public could exchange one of our banknotes for gold to the same value. For example, a \u00a35 note could be exchanged for five gold coins, called sovereigns. But the value of the pound has not been linked to gold for many years, so the meaning of the promise to pay has changed. Exchange into gold is no longer possible and Bank of England notes can only be exchanged for other Bank of England notes of the same face value. Public trust in the pound is now maintained by the operation of monetary policy, the objective of which is price stability. \n\n \n The pound has no been backed by anything since the Breton woods agreement, when it was backed by US dollars and, by proxy, gold. It was, in fact, the british trying to actually redeem their dollars for gold that forced the US to abandon Bretton Woods because it turned out that we had overprinted by a WIDE margin and did not have nearly enough gold for such a redemption.",

   "\"You are one piece of work.\"\n \n \n No, my friend... you are.\n \n \n \n \"In your first sentence you bring up personal choice, that I agree with.\"\n \n Of course you do.. on face value, until things get uncomfortable... in the choices we make, or the conviction that tells us that maybe we made a bad one... then you have problems. never bearing in mind what the purpose of law is for, to show where you fall short... in other words to sheppard choices by indicating which choices are lawful and which ones aren't - it's that simple. It varies form nation and culture, here you were born into a society that values principles over preference. I understand you value to exact opposite... \n \n \n \"It is my personal choice to be who I am, to choose who I love, have sex with,\"\n \n \n This is true insomuch as it is within the framework of the limits of the law... no one would argue that. Homosexuals in this country have been survived by the grace of those who live and let live - other cultures are less tolerant, but more liberal voices among your set want to take things a step further by asking people to ignore their convictions and morally equivocate a historically reviled behavior with that which actually a benefit to society, the people have resoundingly rejected any other notion.\n \n \n \"who I marry, and who and what structure my family takes.\"\n \n Most homosexuals are far more intellectually honest about this \"marriage\" issue than you... they are about fresh meat, and that's it. This is about lust... and catering to it. Marriage is antithetical to that... so both cannot be true Mathew, lastly - your behavior does not have the right to coexist with the same respect a universally respected institution such as marriage between heterosexual couples has.\n \n \n \"In the next sentence you say we must submit to instruction as if we have no choice. Which is it?\"\n \n You just verified the whole reason why we have trouble in law... politics and education today with the left. You are so busy trying to parse what you can handle... you reject what was presented to come to an understanding of it. Read what I said... submission is a choice, you either submit to what is being instructed or rebel and ignore it. Both are choices... Learning occurs when your mind can be taught, it cannot be taught when it is guarded for any reason. If you are parsing what is presented - you are saying you are having trouble with the reality of what is there... then you summarily reject or refrain from being instructed. Knowledge comes from understanding... understanding comes from being teachable... being teachable comes from submission to instruction, and that comes from a heart that wants to be instructed, but that is a personal choice. That is what life is... a series of acceptances and rejections all based on preference or principle... Thus us the reason we poor and rich... dumb and smart, etc. choices. Here, we don;t penalize other people those the choices of others.\n \n \n \n -That Darn Republican",
