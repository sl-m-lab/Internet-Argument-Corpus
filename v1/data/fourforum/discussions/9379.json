Human beings, fish and insects do not evolve--only their genotypes evolve.

That is--\"(biology) the sequence of events involved in the evolutionary development of a species or taxonomic group of organisms\n Synonyms: phylogeny, phylogenesis\".\n \n Now, it seems to me that biological evolution as so definied is indisputable. The fossil record and the evidence of morphological and behavioural change over generations, as empirically observed, leave no doubt that evolution is an historical process, (i.e., sequence of events), wherebye novel bioforms and original varieties of traits and properties come into being, persist for a time, and then (usually) pass away into oblivion, and so is a plain fact. The only question for any reasonable person is, how and why does this happen?\n \n There appear to be two sets of answers to the \"how and why\" questions, (leaving aside the mythology of an anthropomorphic god for whom evolution would simply be a slow, clumsy, and at times embarassing way to go about turning out new toys for \"his\" own amusement). The two different scientific approaches to the phenomenon are the passive and the dynamic.\n \n The passive approach is, and has been for over 150 years, the most popular by far. The passive approach features the materialist assumption that all of existence arises out of a basic substrate of, 'bits of stuff'. Starting at the sub-atomic level, to the atomic where the smallest 'bits of stuff' supposedly generate the 'weak' and the 'strong' nuclear forces, and then the electromagnetic force somehow generates different atoms, and mass, and gravity, and inertia, and molecules, and finally complex things, like us, our children, and our minds. \n \n That is, according to this theory, bits of stuff generate forces that cause bits of stuff to move, willy-nilly, and moving bits of stuff accidentally collide with other moving bits of stuff and the forces they generate make them repeatedly (mechanically) interact with each other in certain predictable ways. The important point is that the 'bits of stuff' responsible for everything have absolutely no say about what they do or what they make of themselves. They are all just prisoners of their own device. Whatever happens, happens because, ultimately, it is the 'nature' of 'bits of stuff' that decrees that it must happen, without those 'bits' ever knowing, or caring, how or why. Even though they are supposedly responsible for everything. \n \n The dynamic theory, OTOH, claims that existence begins with a single existence that manifests itself as several forces, and that it is these forces that generate 'bits of stuff' out of the single existence, and direct and control the 'bits' behaviours towards goals that are broad, general, non-specific and unknown and unpredictable (thanks to quantum indeterminacy) in the long term, but also narrow, specified, knowable and predictable in the proximate and immediate sense.\n \n The passive notion of evolution is, simply stated, that bits of stuff 'just happened to come together' in an accidental agglomeration that generated, spontaneously (they call it 'emergence') a novel way of self-interaction that made them a bit different from other mechanically constructed agglomerations, (nothing real or qualitative, mind), but, at least at the level of 'appearances', different enough to distinguish these particular agglomerations as \"lifeforms\". These \"lifeforms\" are just the product of accidental agglomerations of DNAcid bits of stuff blindly and mechanically operating within cells to cause bigger and more complex systematizations of more 'bits of stuff'. No reason for it. It 'just happens, that's all', because that's the 'nature' of 'bits of stuff' and the universe they have generated, all by themselves. \n And so on to the 'evolutiobnary' changes in these complex systems, aka, living organisms. They, too, change by accident, willy-nilly, thanks to entropic system failure or an atomic/molecular collision of some itinerant 'bit of stuff' accidentally slamming into them. Since they can change in any way, shape, or form, these changes cannot be called 'evolutionary', since they are anomalous and disconnected, following no discernible path or processional direction. To overcome this problem, the 'passive' theoreticians rely upon their \"Natural Selection\".\n \n Passive entities such as inanimate acid molecules are changed by the outside world, and their own forced changes, supposedly, mechanically dictate further changes in the complex systems, organs and organisms, whose forms and behaviours they determine. Thus organisms are seen as hapless, passive bits of stuff themselves, and their success in an everchanging world depends entirely upon just how lucky they are in the random accidental genetic mutation lottery called RMNS.\n \n The dynamic notion of evolution maintains that existence is no accident, and neither is life. That life is a qualitatively different state of affairs from non-life. That life-forms, unlike inanimate forms, possess a measure of self-control and self-directed behaviour that cannot be accounted for by the four physical forces, and as a consequence of this observed behavioural ability, another, or other, natural force/s is/are needed to account for this endogenous dynamism. \n Evolution is, according to this dynamist, neo-vitalist, neo-lamarckian view, (which I have taken the liberty of naming Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis), what live organisms, as autopoietic systems, do for themselves as responses to proximate, immediate, environmental stimuli. They do it primarily as goal-directed epigenetic developmental responses to chronic and vital environmental stimuli.",

Even though you begin with a claim about honest definitions of biological evolution, your first definitions isn't one of them.\n\n \n **\n It is an honest definition of the word itself, in its broadest sense. It is included as one meaning for the word, along with a second, modified meaning. The second meaning stipulates \"biology\", which, to anyone who knows how to use a dictionary, means that the number two meaning, not the number one, is the specifically biological meaning for the word evolution. The 'number one' meaning, i.e., the much broader and inclusive usage, was included as part of the entire definition so that people can get a full and honest look at its meaning.\n \n \n\n It is, in fact, more like the Victorian definition of the word than what it has come to mean today, and certainly not relevant to any biological definition.\n\n \n **\n The word evolution is in constant use today in the broad sense given in the first meaning, where it is regularly applied to developmental and historical processes, generally speaking. For example, \"Splitting the atom was an important event in the evolution of our understanding of atomic energy.\"\n Again, this meaning generally describes continuous, partial, gradual, perpetual, directional and cumulative changes in an entity over time.\n \n \n\n Your definition #1 is the reason that Darwin objected when the term was applied to his theories. It isn't what Darwin had in mind\n\n \n **\n Oh, really? Darwin didn't have a continuous, partial, gradual, perpetual, and cumulative process of minor historical changes in organisms in mind when he broached \"his theory\" of evolution? Then why is it that everything he wrote makes it sound as if that is precisely and exactly what he had in mind? If anything, meaning #1 is much closer to Darwin's thinking than any more modern definition might be. If you think differently, then quote Darwin on what Darwin thought that the word 'evolution' meant.\n \n \n\n Either you don't know what you are talking about (most likely) or you are trying to raise a straw man (dishonest).\n\n \n **\n Well, at least you managed a couple of sentences before resorting to 'ad homimem'. That may be a personal best for you.\n \n\n Of course, any fool can see that your definition #2 is circular. Stating that evolution is an evolutionary process doesn't actually define anything.\n\n \n **\n Well, actually, anyone who is not a fool can see that meaning # 2, the narrowly specified biological definition, is, in its use of the word \"evolutionary\", referring back to the broad sense given in meaning #1. Since I am forced to spell it all out for you, in long form it goes like this--\n meaning #2, (biology {only}) \"the sequence of events involved in the [process in which {organisms} pass[] by degrees to a different stage][in the] development of a species or taxonomic group of organisms\".\n \n But, since you couldn't follow that, we'll leave this widely given definition and go instead to Merriam-Webster--\n \n \"the historical development of a biological group (as a race or species) : PHYLOGENY b : a theory that the various types of animals and plants have their origin in other preexisting types and that the distinguishable differences are due to modifications in successive generations; also : the process described by this theory\"\n \n Any quarrel with this one?\n \n \n\n While you object to embedding some undefined metaphysical postulate in a definition, you apparently don't have an objection to embedding the word itself in its own definition.\n\n \n **\n I simply took the citation from answers.com. , and if you know how to use a dictionary with some degree of reading comprehension, the biological definition is not circular, but is simply narrowly specified and so is dependent upon the broader sense of meaning #1. Nothing wrong, and certainly nothing \"dishonest\", about it,-- provided you have some skill in using dictionaries. \n But I've accepted your objection anyway, and offered another definition that is plainly is not circular, and can be used without reference to the broader sense of the word.\n \n \n\n Would you like to learn about the meanings that biologists assign to the word evolution?\n\n \n \n **\n I've already mentioned them in the OP, so I guess that would be a no.",

When you say \"tested\", I would have to say that wherever natural observations of wild organisms have been seen to modify their behaviour and morphology in response to an immediate, chronic, and vital environmental stimulus, be it an anti-biotic, a pesticide, an herbicide, a nylon-waste pool, new predators, starvation, or even, dare I suggest it, a general altering of environmental background (as in the peppered moth), that it has been 'tested' by empirical observation and inference. Has any 'scientist' abandoned his/her genetic preconceptions of evolution's mechanism (passive, by exogenous selection) long enough to stop fighting the neo-lamarckian devo-evo mechanism (dynamic, by endogenous response) tooth and nail, I would say some, and more every day. I used to have hundreds of links bookmarked, but I no longer save them. You seem to find links quite well, and I've enjoyed reading a lot of what you've brought to my, and other's, attention. \n \n I do not, as I've told you, agree with your religious beliefs, (I have my own), and I cannot see where creationism would be any better off under an EAM 'teleological' model of evolution than it currently is under the RMNS, 'accidental and coincidental' model.\n \n  No. I'm not a scientist, and since this is not the early 19th century, no one would read a book on evolution written by an amateur. The professional literature is definitely leaving the old darwinian paradigm behind, though. But nobody calls the new paradigm, \"Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis\" except myself and a few friends on debating boards. I really don't care what it's called, the basic premises are the same no matter what label it's given by whomever.\n \n I'm intrigued, as I've never heard of whatever it is that you are referring to here. If you have links, I'd love to look at them and then respond to your question. As I say, more and more people every day are abandoning the mechanically passive darwinian 'exogenous selection' model in favour of the much sounder, empirically-based, intelligently dynamic, neo-lamarckian, devo-evo, 'endogenous response' model.\n \n Be glad to look at any and all links you think I'd find interesting. \n \n Thanks, ww\n \n ----------------\n \n Thanks for the good words. I know we don't agree on origins and I know we've had our disagreements in the past, but I enjoy reading your posts as well. You make the darwinists look ridiculous. If you haven't read Peter Borger's info, check him out over at Brainstorms and EvC. Evidently he has a book coming out in '07. His arguments are more on the molecular level but they seem to line up with the neo-lamarckian, non-random variation model. \n \n \n http://www.evcforum.net/cgi-bin/dm.cgi?action=msg&f=22&t=11&m=10\n \n 1) Functional DNA sequences ?although plastic-- are stable throughout time, \n \n 2) organisms demonstrate genetic redundancies that reside in the genome without selective constraint, \n \n 3) mechanism for adaptive phenotypes and variation are preexisting and due to duplication and/or shuffling of preexisting DNA elements ?either genes or other non-coding elements-- that affect gene expression, or due to loss of (redundant) genes, and through RNA editing, \n \n 4) the main function of natural selection is to remove degenerate organisms, and \n \n 5) there is/has been creation (=creaton interactions with matter in a morphogenetic field giving rise to genes and genetic programs in preexisting genetic programs) of multipurpose genomes. \n \n Predictions: \n \n 1) predicts that within species we do not see abundant variation with respect to genes, and usually such genetic alterations are neutral or degenerate (although distinct alleles can be expected through the principle of degeneration, which is in effect the action of entropy, the major mechanism is NRM). \n It also predicts that all organism --even the simplest-- have an elaborate and accurate mechanism to counteract mutations. \n \n 2) predicts that a considerable part of the genes of any organism can be knocked out without being lethal. \n \n 3) predicts that adaptive phenotypes of organism do never demonstrate new genes unrelated to preexisting genes. \n \n 4) predicts that organism lacking vital DNA elements are selected against. \n \n 5) could predict that there are organisms that have not undergone genetic changes (yet). \n \n Falsification: \n \n 1) The GUToB will be falsified by the observation of the evolution of new genes unrelated to preexisting genes. \n \n Of course, a novel theory is subject to changes. I invite everbody to think about it and to have constructive comments. \n \n Best wishes, \n Peter\n ---------------\n \n By the way, you might also check out Lee Spetner's book, \"Not by Chance\" if you haven't already.",

   "\n \n http://www.evcforum.net/cgi-bin/dm.c...f=22&t=11&m=10\n \n \n\n \n **\n Hi SS;\n \n Looking at your link, I think a lot of the basics are indisputable, and may even be now taken as established fact. By that I refer to the reality of non-random genetic mutation and multi-purpose genetic combinations. These are part and parcel of my endogenous dynamism hypothesis, and are directly antithetical to the genetic determinism (passive mechanical) model of the RMNS darwinists.\n \n BUT I think this model will eventually fail for the same reasons that the RMNS model fails--it makes the basic living unit, the cell, and all more complex forms of biosystems, those composed of systems of co-operating cells, nothing better than 'passive clay' being driven, mechanically, by something external, something exogenous to their own being. In this case, a 'god'. At least, upon a quick and cursory reading, that is the impression I'm getting here.\n \n \n \n\n 4) the main function of natural selection is to remove degenerate organisms, and \n\n \n \n **\n My feeling is that the elimination of the maladapted is nothing more than the truism that that which lacks what it takes to live, must die. \"Natural Selection\" is nothing but a vacuous truism that simply states this fact of life in colourful verbiage so that non-thinkers will be conned into believing that this all-purpose bumper-sticker actually signifies something real and actual. \n \n So, for me, \"NS\", being an unreal fantasy, a metaphysical phantasm, serves no 'function' at all wrt the evolution of organisms. In a way, it is just another way of saying 'death', and death's only 'function' is to make room for new life forms so as to continue the presence of life within the biosphere, even as the material part of individual organisms wears out beyond repair. In that sense, death and extinction, (or \"NS\", if people insist on calling these phenomena, \"NS\"), is nothing more than than the necessary entropic outcome of all material systems, and all material parts of all biosystems, as dictated by the second law of thermodynamics.\n \n \n\n By the way, you might also check out Lee Spetner's book, \"Not by Chance\" if you haven't already.\n\n \n **\n I've read a lot of citations from, and reviews of, that book, so I have a fleeting familiarity with it. My local library doesn't have a copy, unfortunately. WRT what little detail I do know of it, I am favourably impressed, so far.",

   "regarding natural selection..............\n \n William Provine, a hightone evolutionist from Cornell, has recently proclaimed that he no longer believes in natural selection: \"I no longer see natural selection as a mechanism, or an active cause of evolution.\" \n \n Not only that but proclaims that a new theory of evolution is needed.\n \n http://www.evolutionnews.org/2005/04/) : \n Quote: \n \n Steve Meyer's criticism of neo-Darwinism was surprisingly narrow, emphasizing natural selection acting upon mutations. I have a far deeper quarrel with the evolutionary biology of the 1960s. I no longer see natural selection as a mechanism, or an active cause of evolution. Natural selection (or adaptation) is a result of many interacting ecological and genetic causes and does not \"work upon\" individual genes. I reject random genetic drift and see the movement of neutral DNA by hitchhiking with pieces of chromosome with high or low survival rates. I reject gene pools, genetic homeostasis, am critical of the biological species concept and all hopes of generating robust phylogenetic trees older than 700 million years ago because of the wide exchange of DNA and RNA between one-celled organisms. Thus I turn out much more critical of neo-Darwinism than does Steve Meyer. None of my criticisms, however, suggest a ID creator, but a more lively and realistic view of evolution than I learned in graduate school.\n \n When a highly credentialed Darwinian guy like Provine indicates that he no longer believes in natural selection, why should little guys in debate forums feel guilty about disbelieving at as well? Natural Selection is nothing but tautology....a fairytale for grownups. \n \n More comments by Provine:\n \n http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00020722-64FD-12BC-A0E483414B7FFE87&pageNumber=8&catID=4\n \n The final day of the conference began with a completely unorthodox lecture by Cornell University evolutionary theorist William Provine. From the projection booth he provided periodic voice-over commentary on text slides we were supposed to read to ourselves (\"I don't read slides\" he proclaimed), but for which he left on the screen for a few fleeting seconds inadequate for reading (and compounded with loud music that forced him to shout into the microphone). The gist of his talk was that we need a new theory of evolution, after which he listed 11 problems that included this statement: \"Natural selection does not shape an adaptation or cause a gene to spread over a population or really do anything at all. It is instead the result of specific causes: hereditary changes, developmental causes, ecological causes, and demography. Natural Selection is the result of these causes, not a cause that is by itself. It is not a mechanism.\" \n \n Without Natural Selection there is no evolution. Richard Dawkins",

   "Really? That should make it easy to avoid any equivocation and confusion among your fellow cognoscente, right?\nRight! There really isn't any confusion among biologists since the definition is almost always quite clear from context. When there is likely to be confusion, it is common to specify which is being used. On these boards, where there tend to be many scientific semi-literates like you, I usually try to make it clear what I mean.\n \n By the way, when you quoted me you put in a [sic?]. (\"For example[sic?],...) You are incorrect. \"example\" is spelled correctly and the expression \"For example\" is also correct. Would you like to learn about English as well as biology?\n \nIt is an honest definition of the word itself, in its broadest sense. It is included as one meaning for the word, along with a second, modified meaning.\nWOOOOOSH! The point seems to have gone right over your head. You began the thread with the statement, \"When biological evolution is honestly defined,...\" and then proceeded to provide a definition that does not apply to biological evolution. That just isn't honest.\n \nThe second meaning stipulates \"biology\", which, to anyone who knows how to use a dictionary, means that the number two meaning, not the number one, is the specifically biological meaning for the word evolution.\nBut you specified that you were about to define biological evolution and then gave a definition that doesn't apply. It really doesn't matter that you mentioned \"biology\" in the second definition, you had already stated that your first definition also applied.\n \nThe 'number one' meaning, i.e., the much broader and inclusive usage, was included as part of the entire definition so that people can get a full and honest look at its meaning.\nThen an \"honest\" discussion would have pointed out that the first definition didn't apply to biology. You had already stated that you were defining biological evolution.\n \nThe word evolution is in constant use today in the broad sense given in the first meaning, where it is regularly applied to developmental and historical processes, generally speaking. For example, \"Splitting the atom was an important event in the evolution of our understanding of atomic energy.\"\n Again, this meaning generally describes continuous, partial, gradual, perpetual, directional and cumulative changes in an entity over time.\nYet further demonstration that you miss the point. Of course the word \"evolution\" is in constant use today in non-biological contexts. But the point is that you claimed that you were about to give an honest definition of biological evolution and then didn't. It further seems that you actually fail to understand the definition of evolution in a non-biological context.\n \nOh, really? Darwin didn't have a continuous, partial, gradual, perpetual, and cumulative process of minor historical changes in organisms in mind when he broached \"his theory\" of evolution?\nBut you have incorrectly defined evolution, both in a biological and non-biological context. In Darwin's time the word evolution meant change along a particular path towards a particular end. For example, stellar evolution. That is not what Darwin proposed. That is what creationists like you propose as the meaning of biological evolution.\n \nThen why is it that everything he wrote makes it sound as if that is precisely and exactly what he had in mind?\nSo you have actually read everything that Darwin wrote? I haven't even done that. Perhaps you would be so kind as to tell us what works by Darwin you have actually read.\n \nIf anything, meaning #1 is much closer to Darwin's thinking than any more modern definition might be.\nThen you haven't even read \"On the Origin of Species.\"\n \nIf you think differently, then quote Darwin on what Darwin thought that the word 'evolution' meant.\nDarwin didn't use the word in \"OTOOS\", except in the final paragraph of the book. \"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\" Clearly, Darwin meant the Victorian meaning of the word, change along a particular path to a particular end. He was referring to the evolutionary history of life.\n \n But Darwin had no choice. The word \"evolution\" was in common use in reference to biological change. It was T.H. Huxley who convinced Darwin to accept the word, just as it was Wallace who convinced him to accept \"survival of the fittest\", to the ever lasting impediment to the understanding of evolutionary theory.\n \nWell, at least you managed a couple of sentences before resorting to 'ad homimem [sic]'. That may be a personal best for you.\nDo you know what an ad hominem [sic] is? Would you like to learn?\n \nWell, actually, anyone who is not a fool can see that meaning # 2, the narrowly specified biological definition, is, in its use of the word \"evolutionary\", referring back to the broad sense given in meaning #1.\nThat's nonsense. Your definition is circular. Definition #1 is not applicable to biological evolution and definition # 2 is meaningless.\n \nSince I am forced to spell it all out for you, in long form it goes like this--\nOffering non circular definitions isn't spelling it out. It is what you should have done in the first place.\n \nmeaning #2, (biology {only}) \"the sequence of events involved in the [process in which {organisms} pass[] by degrees to a different stage][in the] development of a species or taxonomic group of organisms\".\nWell, that's pretty confused. You seem to be grasping at straws. You don't seem to understand and you are thrashing about in an effort to make yourself look as if you understand. Clearly you don't understand.\n \nBut, since you couldn't follow that, we'll leave this widely given definition and go instead to Merriam-Webster--\nYet another \"ad homimem [sic]\" from you. Wouldn't it be better to offer non-circular definitions in the first place? You have forced yourself into a position where you have to get out your Little Golden Dictionary and then use \"ad homimen [sic]\" attacks in an effort to cover your failure.\n \n\"the historical development of a biological group (as a race or species) : PHYLOGENY b : a theory that the various types of animals and plants have their origin in other preexisting types and that the distinguishable differences are due to modifications in successive generations; also : the process described by this theory\"\n \n Any quarrel with this one?\nYes. Simply because the source is meant to instruct scientific illiterates like you. Perhaps you didn't notice that in you quote there are four different meanings assigned to the word: 1) historical observation, 2) phylogeny, 3) a theory that explains genetic changes, and 4) a process.\n \n And you think that I'm wrong when I say that biologists use 3 different meanings?\n \nI simply took the citation from answers.com. , and if you know how to use a dictionary with some degree of reading comprehension, the biological definition is not circular, but is simply narrowly specified and so is dependent upon the broader sense of meaning #1.\nThere are no two ways about it. Your definition was circular. Definition #1 does not apply to biological evolution. Thus, if definition #2 refers to that definition, it is wrong. You just can't state that evolution is an evolutionary process and then claim that it isn't circular. It's just not sane.\n \nNothing wrong, and certainly nothing \"dishonest\", about it,-- provided you have some skill in using dictionaries.\nIndeed I do have such experience. I have used all kinds of dictionaries, standard desk top dictionaries that attempt to educate those without knowledge (the dictionary that you quoted), language dictionaries that give word meanings in other languages, and dictionaries of science, both general science and biological science.\n \nBut I've accepted your objection anyway, and offered another definition that is plainly is not circular, and can be used without reference to the broader sense of the word.\nRight. And you objected to my assertion that biologists use the word \"evolution\" with three different meanings, and then offered a definition with four. Good work.\n \nWould you like to learn about the meanings that biologists assign to the word evolution?\nI've already mentioned them in the OP, so I guess that would be a no.\nI am sorry that you are unwilling to learn. You didn't mention any of the biological definitions of evolution. Definition #1 was not about biology, and definition #2 was circular. Sadly, you don't even seem to understand why you are talking nonsense.",

The second definition is more narrowly circumscribed, wrt to biology, but there is no qualitative difference in meaning between the two, as there would be between say, 'bow' as in boat, or 'bow' as in ribbon, or 'bow' as in bend over, or 'bow' as in arrow launcher, or 'bow' as in bend, etc.\n \n That is to say, to any reasonable person, that in this instance the two meanings are the same meaning; the first broadly expressed, the second the same meaning in a particular instance, with no qualitative semantic shift involved.\n \n That means that the first meaning,-- \"Meaning #1: a process in which something passes by degrees to a different stage (especially a more advanced or mature stage)\n Synonym: development\n Antonym: devolution (meaning #1)\"--\n \n applies, broadly but appropriately, to biology, just as much as it does to anything else that involves 'evolution'. WRT biology, the \"process\" is the historical changes recorded in bioforms, the \"stages\" evidence from the fossil record and observation that show the processional steps linking primitive ancient lifeforms to the complex variations of today's world. WRT to biology, there is absolutely nothing \"dishonest\" or misleading in that definition, and you are being flagrantly dishonest in claiming that there is dishonesty there.\n \n Meanwhile, although \"Meaning #2: (biology) the sequence of events involved in the evolutionary development of a species or taxonomic group of organisms\n Synonyms: phylogeny, phylogenesis\", is more particular to biology itself, it is no more 'honest', (speaking in terms of appropriate semantics), than definition one, since there is no qualitative distinction, but only a quantitative distinction, between the two.\n \n But why am I pointing this out to the likes of pandion?!?

You had already stated that you were defining biological evolution.\n\n \n **\n If I had said that, I would have had to have been just as stupid, ignorant, and/or dishonest as you are, because in actual fact (see above) it does apply to biology, just as much, and just as appropriately, as it applies to any other instance of evolution. The second definition merely narrows the focus of the first.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n The word evolution is in constant use today in the broad sense given in the first meaning, where it is regularly applied to developmental and historical processes, generally speaking. For example, \"Splitting the atom was an important event in the evolution of our understanding of atomic energy.\"\n Again, this meaning generally describes continuous, partial, gradual, perpetual, directional and cumulative changes in an entity over time. \n \n Yet further demonstration that you miss the point. Of course the word \"evolution\" is in constant use today in non-biological contexts. But the point is that you claimed that you were about to give an honest definition of biological evolution and then didn't. It further seems that you actually fail to understand the definition of evolution in a non-biological context.\n\n \n **\n No, actually, your posturing only points out to the world that you simply do not understand the meaning of the word, 'evolution', period. As above, both senses given are appropriate to biology, the first being appropriate to other instances as well, the second, not. It is your own semantically-challenged self that is lkoudly displaying his ignorance in this thread.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n Oh, really? Darwin didn't have a continuous, partial, gradual, perpetual, and cumulative process of minor historical changes in organisms in mind when he broached \"his theory\" of evolution? \n \n But you have incorrectly defined evolution, both in a biological and non-biological context.\n\n \n **\n I didn't make up that definition. It was taken from a reputable reference, namely WordNet, as put out by Princeton University. Go argue with Princeton if you don't like their semantics.\n \n \n\n In Darwin's time the word evolution meant change along a particular path towards a particular end. For example, stellar evolution. That is not what Darwin proposed. \n\n \n **\n Nonsense. Where do you get off insinuating that 'evolvere', the Latin root, or it's English cognate, 'to evolve', ever entailed any sense of predestination or predetermined outcome?!?! The \"particular end\" is only arrived at \"ex post facto\" as far as 'to evolve' or 'evolution' is concerned, and that is how it has always been, from the Roman Empire to this very day. And that is exactly how any educated person, such as Darwin, would have meant it in his day.\n That is, the \"particular end\" would be the biological forms present in the modern world, without any implication that those forms were intended from the beginning to be the forms that exist. That notion was and is peculiar to creationists who are _anti-evolution_. Your supposed meaning for evolution is creationism in disguise, and certainly nothing to do with what the word truly means, nor what Darwin and his supporters took it to mean, nor even what creationists take it to mean. \n \n You are simply telling more stupid lies about the English language, an habitual sin among you and your cronies.\n \n \n\n That is what creationists like you propose as the meaning of biological evolution.\n\n \n **\n First, I am not a creationist, as you well know from my posts, so that's just another slanderous lie from your perpetually corrupt mouth, and second, as above, if anyone is talking creationist trash here, it is you and your opinions on the meaning that the world of Darwin's time gave to the word 'evolution'. Lies, lies, and more lies. Shame on you, and your chronic intellectual dishonesty.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n Then why is it that everything he wrote makes it sound as if that is precisely and exactly what he had in mind? \n \n So you have actually read everything that Darwin wrote? I haven't even done that. Perhaps you would be so kind as to tell us what works by Darwin you have actually read.\n\n \n **\n All of them that are avilable over the net, and so far as I know, all of them are so available. How much have you read? I suspect that I've forgotten more Darwin than you've ever read.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n If anything, meaning #1 is much closer to Darwin's thinking than any more modern definition might be. \n \n Then you haven't even read \"On the Origin of Species.\"\n\n \n **\n Horse manure. And BTW, to the point, modern geneticist definitions of evolution, since they all entail genetics, an inheritance theory to which Darwin was reputedly altogether unfamiliar, such modern definitions could never have been congruent with Darwin's thinking, and in fact, neo-darwinists repudiated genetics for decades (approx. 1900-1930), until the metaphysics of, \"random genetic mutations\", helped them get over and around their theoretical incompatibility.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n If you think differently, then quote Darwin on what Darwin thought that the word 'evolution' meant. \n \n Darwin didn't use the word in \"OTOOS\", except in the final paragraph of the book. \"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\" Clearly, Darwin meant the Victorian meaning of the word, change along a particular path to a particular end. He was referring to the evolutionary history of life.\n\n \n **\n Again, the word 'evolution' has never meant, as you imply, a sense of pre-determined outcome. Not even in victorian England. \"Particular\" does NOT mean, \"predetermined\", or \"predestined\" or \"intended\", and when you imply that it does, you are lying. Whether from pure mendacity, or from ignorance and stupidity, I cannot tell.",

I assume that you are referring to \"vitality\" as a concrete difference between living and non-living things, even though it is unnecessary and untestable.

The difference is the responses that are given by living organisms.

And since when is choosing the easy thing any proof that it's the right thing?\n\n If you actually read my post, you may notice that proof wasn't mentioned. Predictions were mentioned instead. Predictions can be made with statistics, and they tend to be accurate if all of the relevant statistics are considered.\n \n**\n That's just plain ridiculous, and you can't even see it.\n\n Not true. See below.\n \n**\n What store of common usages, (i.e., which dictionary), did you get that notion from? You are really just grabbing stuff out of thin air. Admit it.\n\n Actually, evolution is used for many changes that happen during someone's life. You hear about the evolution of gaming, the evolution of a company, etc.\n Evolution is not the same as change. Evolution requires genes to change, not just any form of change at all. There's a difference.\n \n \n \n**\n What does motion have to do with biology? Oh, that's right, you materialists still believe that everything, even life and all mental and psychical phenomena, are reducible to matter, (i.e., 'bits of stuff'), in motion. A physics that was replaced by quantum physics at the start of the last century.\n\n Organisms can be described in terms of molecules and atoms. Please pay attention:Organisms are made up of cells and some other compounds (such as water, protein strands, etc.) Cells are made up of many things, including the cell membrane, the nucleus, organelles, and the cytoplasm. Interactions of these items cause the cell to respond to stimuli and allow the cell to maintain homeostasis.\n Let's consider these items more carefully. The cell membrane is made up mostly of phospholipids. It is also made up of protein structures. Proteins are made entirely of amino acid chains, and they are found almost everywhere within the cell. Examples are enzymes, which regulate chemical reactions, act as chemical signals, and provide structure. All three of these can be done by a single molecule which requires no special \"5th force\" to work.\n Likewise, the organelles perform functions automatically when they interact with a molecule that they are built to work with. For example, during protein synthesis, a ribosome binds to a strand of mRNA that it comes across. Next, it provides binding sites for tRNA molecules, which bring amino acids to the ribosome and attach if they match the sequence of the mRNA. The protein chain is built in this way until the \"stop codon\" of the mRNA strand is reached.\n \n On a more basic level, the chemical reactions occurring happen because of the forces between atoms. Atoms form bonds because of various forces that cause atoms to attract electrons to \"fill\" their valence shell. This causes electrons either to be transferred from one atom to the other or to be \"shared\" between the two atoms. Both scenarios end up forming a bond between the two atoms (or more, in some cases).\n Such interactions between atoms form the basis of chemical reactions and enzyme actions. For example, to break down a substance, an enzyme will exert an electromagnetic pull on molecules with the correct shape at the correct site within that enzyme. Such interactions allow a cell to break down glucose to produce ATP, an energy source.These chemical interactions happen without a special force that is unique to life. All that is required is the correct setup and the four basic forces.\n \nYours are the deliberate, artificial, distorted, self-serving and dishonest corruptions of that word's meaning, as connived in order to support your passive, geneticist, materialist view of evolution, that began with the invention of your ' RMNS' foolishness just 80 years ago.\n\n Wow. All that and nothing to base it on.\n Remember that your arguments must have a logical starting point that can be accepted by both sides.\n\n **\n Here it is. There was no RMNS before Fisher et al in the late 1920's, and so your population genetic statistical definition of evolution did not exist until the British statistician cum geneticist, Fisher, cooked it up at that time in order that his new notion of evolution's mechanism (i.e., RMNS) would be supported by his new notion of evolution's definition.\n\n That isn't the point. The scientific definition of evolution may have been updated, but that is not a basis for claiming that it is dishonest. If you believe it is, I will be very surprised.\n \n**\n Not all scientists are dishonest, but neither are all scientistts honest. Dishonesty in science is a common thing, as anyone who keeps up with news knows full well. Your childlike confidence in the honesty of scientists is touching, but pitiful.\n\n And scientific conclusions that have been tested by a large number of scientists?\n \n Also:\n Your childlike confidence in a special force that you believe is required for things to move around and respond to the environment is almost touching.\n \n**\n Your \"ToE\" is the pseudoscience. Your metaphysical label for all the shocks the flesh is heir to, namely, \"Natural Selection\", has never been scientifically tested by and through the scientific method in all its 150+ year history.\n\n Really? How about this test?\n (By the way, the page I linked you to may be short, but it contains a link to the full text. Don't complain that there isn't enough information.)\n \nYour , \"Random (accidental yet coincidentally adaptive when expressed)Genetic Mutation\" is so blatantly metaphysical and scientifically untestable that, like the elephant in the room, most real scientists spend most of their energy just trying to pretend that it isn't really there.\n\n Genetic mutations happen. Do you deny that?\n Note: cancer is caused by a mutation, and it passes the mutation on through, you guessed it: genes.\n \n As for adaptive mutations, they happen as well. If you deny that, you will be presented with large lists of mutations that have proven to be adaptive.\n \n**\n Yes, it is. You should look up a word before you make statements that use it.

Untestable hypotheses are unnecessary and quite probably wrong.\n \n Here's a convenient resource: TalkOrigins.\"The naturalism that science adopts is methodological naturalism. It does not assume that nature is all there is; it merely notes that nature is the only objective standard we have. The supernatural is not ruled out a priori; when it claims observable results that can be studied scientifically, the supernatural is studied scientifically (e.g., Astin et al. 2000; Enright 1999).

Predictions can never be made from statistics, only trends, and continuing trends are 'projections' not 'predictions' in any scientific sense of the word. That's like saying that the trend here has been to have summers that are warmer than winters, therefore we \"predict\" (meaning, 'project')that next summer will be warmer that this winter. Only a fool calls that a scientific prediction of the sort required by the scientific method. The SM requires that the predicted outcome have a reasonable chance of failing given the initial factors involved. Projections don't have that.\n Statistical projections sometimes fail, but only when initial conditions are altered by an unpredictable and unpredicted (random) factor, mid-stream. That ain't part of the scientific method.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n **\n What store of common usages, (i.e., which dictionary), did you get that notion from?

Oh, that's right, you materialists still believe that everything, even life and all mental and psychical phenomena, are reducible to matter, (i.e., 'bits of stuff'), in motion. A physics that was replaced by quantum physics at the start of the last century. \n \n Organisms can be described in terms of molecules and atoms. Please pay attention:\n Organisms are made up of cells and some other compounds (such as water, protein strands, etc.) Cells are made up of many things, including the cell membrane, the nucleus, organelles, and the cytoplasm. Interactions of these items cause the cell to respond to stimuli and allow the cell to maintain homeostasis.\n\n \n **\n You're the one who needs to pay closer attention to yourself. Here you admit that the real issue is not the substances involved, but the forms they take, and above all, \"the interactions of these items\". \"Items\"!?!! Oh well. Just how and why do these 'items' \"cause\" the cell (as in a part 'causing' its overriding whole) to \"respond to stimuli and allow the cell to maintain homeostasis\"? In case you've forgotten, those \"items\" will still be there when the cell is dead. So why won't they be interacting and causing the cell to act alive? The stuff you're saying is meaningless gibberish. Something else has to be present are those 'items' won't do anything and the cell won't function as a system. Energy, sure, but besides being a vague catch-all label, just what is energy, particularly in this case? What's its source? Certainly not the 4 physical forces; they're still there, but nothing's working in the dead cell.\n \n \n\n Let's consider these items more carefully. The cell membrane is made up mostly of phospholipids. It is also made up of protein structures. Proteins are made entirely of amino acid chains, and they are found almost everywhere within the cell. Examples are enzymes, which regulate chemical reactions, act as chemical signals, and provide structure. All three of these can be done by a single molecule which requires no special \"5th force\" to work.\n Likewise, the organelles perform functions automatically when they interact with a molecule that they are built to work with. For example, during protein synthesis, a ribosome binds to a strand of mRNA that it comes across. Next, it provides binding sites for tRNA molecules, which bring amino acids to the ribosome and attach if they match the sequence of the mRNA. The protein chain is built in this way until the \"stop codon\" of the mRNA strand is reached.\n\n \n **\n Yada yada yada. If that's all it takes, bring just one dead cell back to life.\n \n \n\n On a more basic level, the chemical reactions occurring happen because of the forces between atoms. Atoms form bonds because of various forces that cause atoms to attract electrons to \"fill\" their valence shell. This causes electrons either to be transferred from one atom to the other or to be \"shared\" between the two atoms. Both scenarios end up forming a bond between the two atoms (or more, in some cases).\n Such interactions between atoms form the basis of chemical reactions and enzyme actions. For example, to break down a substance, an enzyme will exert an electromagnetic pull on molecules with the correct shape at the correct site within that enzyme.

Metabolism includes the conversion of nonliving material into cellular components (synthesis) and the decomposition of organic matter (catalysis), producing energy. Growth in living matter is an increase in size of all parts, as distinguished from simple addition of material; it results from a higher rate of synthesis than catalysis. Irritability, or response to stimuli, takes many forms, from the contraction of a unicellular organism when touched to complex reactions involving all the senses of higher animals; in plants response is usually much different than in animals but is nonetheless present. Adaptation, the accommodation of a living organism to its present or to a new environment, is fundamental to the process of evolution and is determined by the individual's heredity. The division of one cell to form two new cells is reproduction; usually the term is applied to the production of a new individual (either asexually, from a single parent organism, or sexually, from two differing parent organisms), although strictly speaking it also describes the production of new cells in the process of growth.\"\n \n **\n The principal feature of life, the functions of autopoietic systems, is endogenously driven self-organization, including any and all of its parts. Here we have an instance of a cell repairing (re-organizing) a damaged part. Big deal. Sick and injured organisms, from buttercups to bobolinks, do that every day. Here we have a cell that can internally repair its own DNA. It couldn't do that, or anything else dynamic, if it was dead. By my definition, the difference between a live biosystem (cell or whatever) and anything else is that a live system is dynamic,i.e., self-directed and self-sustaining, whereas everything else is just passive 'stuff' that is at the mercy of external forces. Like billiard balls.\n Any biosystem that can still repair itself is far from dead, whether you want it to be or not. God forbid you are in the medical profession--or an undertaker, come to that.",

Unless you want to attribute these repairs, not to the life in the cell, but to random DNA molecules bumping together, or perhaps, the \"Flying Spaghetti Monster\", or, as you call it, \"Selection\", then you'd better admit that that cell is not dead at all.

DNA and RNA are information codes. Codes require abstract symbology. The study of signs and symbols is called 'semiotics'. There is a closely related field called 'biosemiotics'. The heart of semiotics is that 'meaning', or 'significance' can be carried by something from a sender to a receiver without any need for the carrying mechanism, the 'sign', being aware of it, but both sender and receiver must be aware of a shared significance or meaning. Only intelligent entities have that personal awareness that enables them to discover meaning for themselves. Books, maps, billbords, stopsigns, computers and their codes, do not. Neither do genes and genomes, but live organisms, including bacteria cells, bacteria colonies, banana plants and human beings, do.\n \n \n\n Well, DNA has not been synthesized using a reasonable process, but I know that RNA has been created using simple chemical reactions.\n\n \n **\n Only by intelligent design and live designers; never by random accident.

It merely shows that you are incapable of any more adult and reasoned response. \n \n On complex systems:--[all that follows is found at answers.com]\n \n \"Various informal descriptions of complex systems have been put forward, and these may give some insight into their properties. A special edition of Science about complex systems Science Vol. 284. No. 5411 (1999). highlighted several of these:\n \n A complex system is a highly structured system, which shows structure with variations (Goldenfeld and Kadanoff) \n A complex system is one whose evolution is very sensitive to initial conditions or to small perturbations, one in which the number of independent interacting components is large, or one in which there are multiple pathways by which the system can evolve (Whitesides and Ismagilov) \n A complex system is one that by design or function or both is difficult to understand and verify (Weng, Bhalla and Iyengar) \n A complex system is one in which there are multiple interactions between many different components (D. Rind) \n Complex systems are systems in process that constantly evolve and unfold over time (W. Brian Arthur). \"\n \n And--\n \n \"The term complex system has no precise definition but can often be taken to mean a system with many strongly-coupled degrees of freedom. Traditional methods of mathematical modeling are adept at handling systems with few degrees of freedom that interact strongly, such as the paradigmatic simple harmonic oscillator, while statistical methods are useful for systems with very many degrees of freedom all of which interact weakly, such as a box of gas. Complex systems such as the Potts model occupy the intermediary regime, where local and global phenomena interact in complicated, often nonlinear ways. (For consistency, the examples cited above are all drawn from physics even though complex systems are studied by many scientific disciplines.)\"\n \n and--\n \n \"Features of complex systems in nature\n \n Relationships are non-linear\n In practical terms, this means a small perturbation may cause a large effect (see butterfly effect), a proportional effect, or even no effect at all. In linear systems, effect is always directly proportional to cause. See nonlinearity.\n \n \n Relationships contain feedback loops\n Both negative (damping) and positive (amplifying) feedback are often found in complex systems. The effects of an element's behaviour are fed back to in such a way that the element itself is altered.\n \n \n Complex systems are open\n Complex systems in nature are usually open systems - that is, they exist in a thermodynamic gradient and dissipate energy. In other words, complex systems are usually far from energetic equilibrium: but despite this flux, there may be pattern stability. See synergetics.\n \n \n Complex systems have a memory\n The history of a complex system may be important. Because complex systems are dynamical systems they change over time, and prior states may have an influence on present states. More formally, complex systems often exhibit hysteresis.\n \n \n Complex systems may be nested\n The components of a complex system may themselves be complex systems. For example, an economy is made up of organisations, which are made up of people, which are made up of cells - all of which are complex systems.\n \n \n Boundaries are difficult to determine\n It can be difficult to determine the boundaries of a complex system. The decision is ultimately made by the observer.\n \n \n Dynamic network of multiplicity\n As well as coupling rules, the dynamic network of a complex system is important. Small-world or scale-free networks which have many local interactions and a smaller number of inter-area connections are often employed. Natural complex systems often exhibit such topologies. In the human cortex for example, we see dense local connectivity and a few very long axon projections between regions inside the cortex and to other brain regions.\"\n \n and\n \n \"The study of complex systems is bringing new vitality to many areas of science where a more typical reductionist[see, 'mechanical'-ww] strategy has fallen short. Complex systems is therefore often used as a broad term encompassing a research approach to problems in many diverse disciplines including neuroscience, meteorology, chemistry, physics, computer science, psychology, artificial life, evolutionary computation, economics, earthquake prediction, heart cell synchronisation, immune systems, reaction-diffusion systems, molecular biology, epilepsy and inquiries into the nature of living cells themselves. In these endeavours, scientists often seek simple non-linear coupling rules which lead to complex phenomena (rather than describe - see above), but this need not be the case. Human societies (and probably human brains) are complex systems in which neither the components nor the couplings are simple. Nevertheless, they exhibit many of the hallmarks of complex systems.[see above--ww].\n \n Traditionally, engineering has striven to keep its systems linear[i.e., mechanical--ww], because that makes them simpler to build and to predict. However, many physical systems (for example lasers) are inherently \"complex systems\" in terms of the definition above, and engineering practice must now include elements of complex systems research.\n \n Information theory applies well to the complex adaptive systems, CAS, through the concepts of object oriented design. [bold mine--ww]\n \n Entropy we've been over, but the definition I use is this--\n \n \"Inevitable and steady deterioration of a system or society.\"\n \n 'Deterioration' means any decrease in the dynamism and synergy involved in the sytemic operations that results in a loss of productivity for the given system.\n \n Now you've got the terms, simply show us \"an example of random mutation causing novel functioning variation that fits\" the above. That is, that far from being an example of \"Inevitable and steady deterioration of a [complex, as above]]system [eg., the genome and its uber-organism], in that it _increases_the dynamism and synergy involved in the given systemic operations that results in a gain of productivity for the given system.\n \n \n\n ETA: Of course, realize that any example I give will be labeled (without reason) by wabbit as \"non-random.\" (You know, another \"no true Scotsman\" problem.)\n\n \n \n **\n Nice attempt to 'poison the well'.

For instance we now have, along with Heidinger's 'negentropy' and information theory entropy--\n \n \"Miscellaneous definitions\n Entropy unit - a non-S.I. unit of thermodynamic entropy, usually denoted \"e.u.\" \n Gibbs entropy - the usual statistical mechanical entropy of a thermodynamic system. \n Boltzmann entropy - a type of Gibbs entropy, which neglects internal statistical correlations in the overall particle distribution. \n Tsallis entropy - a generalization of the standard Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. \n Standard molar entropy - is the entropy content of one mole of substance, under conditions of standard temperature and pressure. \n Black hole entropy - is the entropy carried by a black hole, which is proportional to the surface area of the black hole.[45] \n Residual entropy - the entropy present after a substance is cooled arbitrarily close to absolute zero. \n Entropy of mixing - the change in the entropy when two different chemical substances or components are mixed. \n Loop entropy - is the entropy lost upon bringing together two residues of a polymer within a prescribed distance. \n Conformational entropy - is the entropy associated with the physical arrangement of a polymer chain that assumes a compact or globular state in solution. \n Entropic force - a microscopic force or reaction tendency related to system organization changes, molecular frictional considerations, and statistical variations. \n Free entropy - an entropic thermodynamic potential analogous to the free energy. \n Entropic explosion - an explosion in which the reactants undergo a large change in volume without releasing a large amount of heat. \n Entropy change - a change in entropy dS between two equilibrium states is given by the heat transferred dQrev divided by the absolute temperature T of the system in this interval.[46] \n Sackur-Tetrode entropy - the entropy of a monatomic classical ideal gas determined via quantum considerations.\"\n \n and--\n \n \"Entropology - the study or discussion of entropy or the name sometimes given to thermodynamics without differential equations.[3][47] \n Psychological entropy - the distribution of energy in the psyche, which tends to seek equilibrium or balance among all the structures of the psyche.[48] \n Economic entropy - a quantitative measure of the irrevocable dissipation and degradation of natural materials and available energy with respect to economic activity.[49][50] \n Social entropy - a measure of social system structure, having both theoretical and statistical interpretations, i.e. society (macrosocietal variables) measured in terms of how the individual functions in society (microsocietal variables); also related to social equilibrium.[51] \n Corporate entropy - energy waste as red tape and business team inefficiency, i.e. energy lost to waste.[52] \"\n \n And here's an actually humourous 'entropy joke--\n \n \"As stated by John von Neumann in conversation with Claude Shannon in 1949:[53][54] \n Nobody knows what entropy really is, so in a debate you will always have the advantage.\" \n \n But beyond all that, the only reason we are even discussing 'entropy' here is because you claim that the entropic action of random, accidental genetic mutation can decrease entropy in a complex, dynamic, self-organised, autopoietic biosystem, i.e., live organism. Your whole materialist/mechanist 'spontaneous generation' random accident base for evolution's mechanism depends upon you doing that, but of course, you cannot. Because it is simply impossible. \n \n Which is why you are now trying to slither out of your fix, below.\n \n \n\n Expecting to become an expert via answers.com is absurd.\n\n \n **\n Yes, it is. Good thing I never made such a foolish claim. Unlike your claim that you, with your \"degree in chemistry\", are indeed an expert on the subject. All I did was go to a lot of trouble to find, at answers.com and elsewhere, an objective and reputable authority on the definition of entropy. All you do is pooh-pooh dictionaries for not defining words the way youy want them defined. When are you going to stand up and tell us just what your definition of 'entropy' is? I mean, since your degree in chemistry makes you more of an expert on entropyu than the contributors to a dozen science dictionaries and glossaries who define it as \"The amount of randomness or disorder in a system\", what's your own ingeniously correct definition, oh exalted expert?\n \n \n\n wikipedia is worlds better on this topic, but I don't expect anybody to glean nearly complete knowledge from even that. Try comprehending this before you talk about \"disorder\" again:\n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wikipedia \n When a system's energy is defined as the sum of its \"useful\" energy, (e.g. that used to push a piston), and its \"useless energy\", i.e. that energy which cannot be used for external work, then entropy may be (most concretely) visualized as the \"scrap\" or \"useless\" energy whose energetic prevalence over the total energy of a system is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the considered system. \n\n \n **\n And you can say this with a straight face?! Forcing an analogy between a live cell or eukaryotic cell system, i.e., complex dynamic open self-organised biosystems, and the amount of heat left over after gasoline fumes explode in the cylinder of an internal combustion engine? Oh, wow, that's some wonderful understanding of biology that they taught you in chemistry class!!\n \n There is no comparison, and anyone but you and your claque knows it. So you \"Try comprehending this before you talk about [\"entropy\"] again.\"\n \n \n\n If you're not going to define it as a state functions from heat and temperature, then the best you can do is probably \"unuseable energy.\"\n\n \n **\n Since that definition is perfectly vacuous, I don't think I'll bother. When talking of the complexity in complex systems, especially biologically complex dynamic systems, synergy and coherence depend upon an imposed ordering of interdependent parts operating together in order to achieve goals and produce preferred outcomes. Disorder makes for decoherence and a loss of that productivity. In such systems, whether it is called \"disorder\" or \"equilibrium\", the extent of the state to which the system's synergistic productivity is maximised or minimised by the ordering and functioning of its parts is the real measure of its 'entropy'. Not the amount of heat given off as a by-product of its operations.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n The sole and only \"magical force\" at issue here is the \"magical force\" of 'spontaneous generation' that your silly nonsense depends upon. \n \n \"Sole and only,\" huh? How funny.\n The derisive laughter fades, however, when we realize that you're using the insane creationist canard that evolution is dependent upon abiogenesis. You are not this dumb. Stop pretending.\n\n \n **\n Reduced to using personal scorn as if it were an argument? Ooops! What am I saying?!? That was always your starting point. You couldn't argue an idea if your life depended upon it.\n \n And what passing cloud you snatched this latest assertion re creationism and abiogenesis from, is beyond me. Talk about a 'non sequitur'!! That really takes the cake. You seem to have totally flipped out.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n If I can, then that's your problem for not being able to empirically demonstrate otherwise. \n \n The problem is not that I can't empirically demonstrate it; the problem is that there is no even conceptual or hypothetical scenario that could do so.\n\n \n **\n Exactly what I've been saying since forever. And that is why your \"RMNS\" is not science at all, but only metaphysical hokum. About time that you faced up to that painful truth.\n \n \n \n\n So pointing out that your assertion is completely unfalsifiable is wriggling? \n\n \n **\n No, admitting that your RMNS assertion is completely unfalsifiable is what you did. And about time, too.\n \n Trying to squirm around that fact by pretending that EAM is equally untestable and unfalsifiable is is not only 'wriggling', it's a downright lie, since I've already told you guys how EAM could be falsified following the protocols of the scientific method. Peeling tried to counter that with a link that was a non sequitur to the assertion, but no matter. Here again--falsify EAM by showing an instance of a novel adaptive trait, or an adaptively improved form of an inherited adaptive trait, arising in a static environment to which the organism/s involved have been truly adapted for generations. If that happens, without any novel environmental stimulus occuring prior to the evidence of the mutation, then the novel adaptive trait mutation arose spontaneously, 'coincidental wrt adaptedness', as per RMNS, rather than responsively, internally directed towards improved adaptedness, as per EAM. \n And don't give me any gears about such a test being impossible to devise.\n \n \n\n No, Holmes, falsifiability is a requirement of science. Your position doesn't have it, so your position is not science. 'Twas kind of you to put it so unequivocally, too.\n\n \n **\n You're speaking for yourself, swami, and if you could read properly, you'd know it.",

That is, any entropy that does not arise from heat transfer, (i.e., temperature change in a closed system), is not thermodynamic entropy. The kind that lyte and his materialist/mechanist pals falsely attribute to open, dynamic, complex, information-driven, biological systems.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n It applies only to closed mechanical linear systems. \n \n Wrong again. The definition of entropy applies everywhere.\n\n \n **\n Which definition of entropy has this universal application? Would it be the one Clausius coined, along with the word, 'entropy', in 1865? That one seems closest to what lyte means by the term, even though, as Feynman points out, physics could get along without it since it is NOT universally applicable.\n \n \"Clausius decided that the conserved ratio must correspond to a real, physical quantity, and he named it \"entropy\".\n Surely not every conserved ratio corresponds to a real, physical quantity. Historical accident has introduced this term to science. On another planet there could be physics without the concept of entropy. It completely lacks intuitive clarity. Even the great physicist James Clerk Maxwell had it backward for a while (4). Nevertheless, the term has stuck. \n \n The American Heritage Dictionary gives as the first definition of entropy, \"For a closed system, the quantitative measure of the amount of thermal energy not available to do work.\" So it's a negative kind of quantity, the opposite of available energy.\"\n \n Sort of like 'randomness' or 'chance', both of which are linked to entropy, the term, being negative and referring, therefore, to a 'non-thing' which is nothing but the absence of something actual, and so is basically useless to science except as a bumper-sticker of convenience.\n \n How about Ludwig Boltzmann's definition of mechanical entropy? It goes like this, entropy-- \"a measure of disorder or randomness in a closed system.\" Note that we're still talking \"closed systems\", not open biosystems, but at least we're getting closer. To continue--\n \n \"Entropy in this latter sense has come to be used in the growing fields of information science, computer science, communications theory, etc. The story is often told that in the late 1940s, John von Neumann, a pioneer of the computer age, advised communication-theorist Claude E. Shannon to start using the term entropy when discussing information because \"no one knows what entropy really is, so in a debate you will always have the advantage\" (6). \n \n Richard Feynman knew there is a difference between the two meanings of entropy. He discussed thermodynamic entropy in the section called \"Entropy\" of his Lectures on Physics published in 1963 (7), using physical units, joules per degree, and over a dozen equations (vol I section 44-6). He discussed the second meaning of entropy in a different section titled \"Order and entropy\" (vol I section 46-5) as follows: \n \n So we now have to talk about what we mean by disorder and what we mean by order. ... Suppose we divide the space into little volume elements. If we have black and white molecules, how many ways could we distribute them among the volume elements so that white is on one side and black is on the other? On the other hand, how many ways could we distribute them with no restriction on which goes where? Clearly, there are many more ways to arrange them in the latter case. We measure \"disorder\" by the number of ways that the insides can be arranged, so that from the outside it looks the same. The logarithm of that number of ways is the entropy. The number of ways in the separated case is less, so the entropy is less, or the \"disorder\" is less.\"\n \n And this leads to Claude Shannon's concept of informational entropy, or as Klyce calls it, 'logical entropy', which, IMHO, is the only one applicable to biosystems.\n \n \"Claude Shannon himself seems to be aware of these differences in his famous 1948 paper, \"A Mathematical Theory of Communcation\" (8). With respect to the parcelling he writes, \"In the continuous case the measurement is relative to the coordinate system. If we change coordinates the entropy will in general change\" (p 37, Shannon's italics).\n \n In the same paper Shannon attaches no physical units to his entropy and never mentions Boltzmann's constant, k. At one point he briefly introduces K, saying tersely, \"The constant K merely amounts to a choice of a unit of measure\" (p 11). Although the the 55-page paper contains more than 300 equations, K appears only once again, in Appendix 2, which concludes, \"The choice of coefficient K is a matter of convenience and amounts to the choice of a unit of measure\" (p 29). Shannon never specifies the unit of measure.\n \n This sort of entropy is clearly different. Physical units do not pertain to it, and (except in the case of digital information) an arbitrary convention must be imposed before it can be quantified. To distinguish this kind of entropy from thermodynamic entropy, let's call it logical entropy.\"\n \n and-\n \n \"In spite of the important distinction between the two meanings of entropy, the rule as stated above for thermodynamic entropy seems to apply nonetheless to the logical kind: entropy in a closed system can never decrease. And really, there would be nothing mysterious about this law either. It's similar to saying things never organize themselves.\n [bold mine. Note that this law is part of the law, \"Ex nihilo, nihil fecit\". \"Nothing can be made from nothing\".--ww] \n (The original meaning of organize is \"to furnish with organs.\") Only this rule has little to do with thermodynamics.\"\n \n and--\n \n \"Conclusion\n In my opinion, the audacious attempt to reveal the formal equivalence of the ideas of biological organization and thermodynamic order ...must be judged to have failed. - Peter Medawar (30) \n Computer scientist Rolf Landauer wrote an article published in June, 1996, which contains insight that should discourage attempts to physically link the two kinds of entropy. He demonstrates that \"there is no unavoidable minimal energy requirement per transmitted bit\" (31). Using Boltzmann's constant to tie together thermodynamic entropy and logical entropy is thus shown to be without basis. One may rightly object that the minimal energy requirement per bit of information is unrelated to logical entropy. But this supposed requirement was the keystone of arguments connecting the two concepts. \n \n \n Landauer \n It is surprising that mixing entropy and biology still fosters confusion. The relevant concepts from physics pertaining to the second law of thermodynamics are at least 100 years old. The confusion can be eradicated if we distinguish thermodynamic from logical entropy, and admit that Earth's biological system is open to organizing input from outside. \"\n \n All quoted material from Brig Klyse at--\n http://www.panspermia.org/seconlaw.htm\n \n And of course, for me, though not for Klyce, the \"organizing input\" is Vitality.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n But we aren't discussing 'thermodynamics'.

   "FYI\n \n \"Connections\n Biology's next revolution\n Nigel Goldenfeld1 and Carl Woese2\n \n Nigel Goldenfeld is in the Department of Physics and Institute for Genomic Biology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1110 West Green Street, Urbana, Illinois 61801, USA.\n Carl Woese is in the Department of Microbiology and Institute for Genomic Biology, 601 South Goodwin Avenue, Urbana, Illinois 61801, USA.\n \n Top of pageAbstractThe emerging picture of microbes as gene-swapping collectives demands a revision of such concepts as organism, species and evolution itself.\n \n One of the most fundamental patterns of scientific discovery is the revolution in thought that accompanies a new body of data. Satellite-based astronomy has, during the past decade, overthrown our most cherished ideas of cosmology, especially those relating to the size, dynamics and composition of the Universe.\n \n \n KAPUSTA\n Similarly, the convergence of fresh theoretical ideas in evolution and the coming avalanche of genomic data will profoundly alter our understanding of the biosphere - and is likely to lead to revision of concepts such as species, organism and evolution. Here we explain why we foresee such a dramatic transformation, and why we believe the molecular reductionism that dominated twentieth-century biology will be superseded by an interdisciplinary approach that embraces collective phenomena.\n \n The place to start is horizontal gene transfer (HGT), the non-genealogical transfer of genetic material from one organism to another - such as from one bacterium to another or from viruses to bacteria. Among microbes, HGT is pervasive and powerful - for example, in accelerating the spread of antibiotic resistance. Owing to HGT, it is not a good approximation to regard microbes as organisms dominated by individual characteristics. In fact, their communications by genetic or quorum-sensing channels indicate that microbial behaviour must be understood as predominantly cooperative.\n \n In the wild, microbes form communities, invade biochemical niches and partake in biogeochemical cycles. The available studies strongly indicate that microbes absorb and discard genes as needed, in response to their environment. Rather than discrete genomes, we see a continuum of genomic possibilities, which casts doubt on the validity of the concept of a 'species' when extended into the microbial realm. The uselessness of the species concept is inherent in the recent forays into metagenomics - the study of genomes recovered from natural samples as opposed to clonal cultures. For example, studies of the spatial distribution of rhodopsin genes in marine microbes suggest such genes are 'cosmopolitan', wandering among bacteria (or archaea) as environmental pressures dictate.\n \n Equally exciting is the realization that viruses have a fundamental role in the biosphere, in both immediate and long-term evolutionary senses. Recent work suggests that viruses are an important repository and memory of a community's genetic information, contributing to the system's evolutionary dynamics and stability. This is hinted at, for example, by prophage induction, in which viruses latent in cells can become activated by environmental influences. The ensuing destruction of the cell and viral replication is a potent mechanism for the dispersal of host and viral genes.\n \n It is becoming clear that microorganisms have a remarkable ability to reconstruct their genomes in the face of dire environmental stresses, and that in some cases their collective interactions with viruses may be crucial to this. In such a situation, how valid is the very concept of an organism in isolation? It seems that there is a continuity of energy flux and informational transfer from the genome up through cells, community, virosphere and environment. We would go so far as to suggest that a defining characteristic of life is the strong dependency on flux from the environment - be it of energy, chemicals, metabolites or genes.\n \n Nowhere are the implications of collective phenomena, mediated by HGT, so pervasive and important as in evolution. A computer scientist might term the cell's translational apparatus (used to convert genetic information to proteins) an 'operating system', by which all innovation is communicated and realized. The fundamental role of translation, represented in particular by the genetic code, is shown by the clearly documented optimization of the code. Its special role in any form of life leads to the striking prediction that early life evolved in a lamarckian way, with vertical descent marginalized by the more powerful early forms of HGT.\n \n Refinement through the horizontal sharing of genetic innovations would have triggered an explosion of genetic novelty, until the level of complexity required a transition to the current era of vertical evolution. Thus, we regard as regrettable the conventional concatenation of Darwin's name with evolution, because other modalities must also be considered.\n \n This is an extraordinary time for biology, because the perspective we have indicated places biology within a context that must necessarily engage other disciplines more strongly aware of the importance of collective phenomena. Questions suggested by the generic energy, information and gene flows to which we have alluded will probably require resolution in the spirit of statistical mechanics and dynamical systems theory. In time, the current approach of post-hoc modelling will be replaced by interplay between quantitative prediction and experimental test, nowadays more characteristic of the physical sciences.\n \n Sometimes, language expresses ignorance rather than knowledge, as in the case of the word 'prokaryote', now superseded by the terms archaea and bacteria. We foresee that in biology, new concepts will require a new language, grounded in mathematics and the discoveries emerging from the data we have highlighted. During an earlier revolution, Antoine Lavoisier observed that scientific progress, like evolution, must overcome a challenge of communication: \"We cannot improve the language of any science without at the same time improving the science itself; neither can we, on the other hand, improve a science without improving the language or nomenclature which belongs to it.\" Biology is about to meet this challenge.\"\n \n **\n all bold mine--ww\n \n at;\n \n http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v445/n7126/full/445369a.html",

Did you read the paper of just look for 'juicy' phrases? What was the context of \"massive\" in this article?\n\n \n In context, the mined quote goes, \"Other than the special case of mobile genetic elements (and plant mitochondrial genomes, see below), HGT is largely unknown in multicellular eukaryotes but is more or less common in diverse groups of unicellular protists, which contain several to many genes derived by HGT from both prokaryotes and other protists (2).\"\n \n The objection appasrently being that HGT in plant mitochondrial genomes does not \"count\" as HGT.emoticon_rolleyes \n You can roll your eyes all you want, but the joke is on you and you do not even realize it. It is your contention, is it not, that HGT is somehoe an EAM-friendly phenomenon, that it somehow undermines normal evolutionary processes/cannot be explained by evolution/is a big problem for evolutin. Accurate? If so, the the material in the very paper you cite does not indicate this at all. The 'massive' amount is 'massive' as compared to very little or none at all, and in fact it is only in mtDNA thus far. \n It is jnot that that HGT 'doesn't count', it is that you have vastly overstated the implications with your choice of boldings and such - a pitfall of relying on keyword searches rather than on trying to understand the gist of the entire article.\n\n \n But HGT is defined as--\"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), also Lateral gene transfer (LGT), is any process in which an organism transfers genetic material to another cell that is not its offspring.\" [answers.com] So surprize, smart guys, it counts!\n\n \n Why the insults? Skepticism regarding your comment-free quote fest is not insulting to you. Is it?\n\n \n And in the link this is directly followed by--\"Recent studies indicate that plant mtDNAs are unusually active in HGT relative to all other organellar genomes and nuclear genomes of multicellular eukaryotes. Four papers (3-6) have reported a total of nine cases of mitochondrial HGT within seed plants. Three transfers involve parasitic angiosperms as putative donors or recipients and implicate direct, plant-to-plant transfer of DNA as one mechanism of HGT (5, 6). Each of the nine transfers involves a different set of recipient plants.\" \n \n So much for your dreck, boys.\n\n \n \n Wow.... 9 whole cases....\n \n Howe many genes in the mt genome again?\n \n I'm not sure which I find more entertaining - the fact that WW has misinterpreted the paper and doesn't know it, or that he thinks he proved some sort of point and put all the skeptics 'in their place' by essentially re-posting the same quotes.",

Lateral gene transfer - the transfer of genetic material between species - has been acknowledged as a major mechanism in prokaryotic genome evolution for some time. Recently accumulating data indicate that the process also occurs in the evolution of eukaryotic genomes. However, there are large rate variations between groups of eukaryotes; animals and fungi seem to be largely unaffected, with a few exceptions, while lateral gene transfer frequently occurs in protists with phagotrophic lifestyles, possibly with rates comparable to prokaryotic organisms. Gene transfers often facilitate the acquisition of functions encoded in prokaryotic genomes by eukaryotic organisms, which may enable them to colonize new environments. Transfers between eukaryotes also occur, mainly into larger phagotrophic eukaryotes that ingest eukaryotic cells, but also between plant lineages. These findings have implications for eukaryotic genomic research in general, and studies of the origin and phylogeny of eukaryotes in particular.\n Key words. Horizontal gene transfer - lateral gene transfer - phylogeny - origin of eukaryotes - phagotrophy - endosymbiotic gene transfer - eukaryote phylogeny\n \n Received 3 December 2004; received after revision 24 January 2005; accepted 1 February 2005 \n \n http://www.springerlink.com/content/k223q1668436n305/",

   "**\n My last word on LGT in this thread--\n \n \"Lateral gene transfer in eukaryotes\"\n\n It's always good to learn something new. Unfortunately for wabbit, this isn't really new to the conversation here; the abstract talks mainly about HGT in protists, a motley collection of critters which are either unicellular (the majority of the kingdom) or very simple multicellular organisms. The abstract doesn't identify the protists studied, nor does it elaborate at all on the claim about plants. (In fact, the only \"examples\" we've seen of the latter have been rejected by the scientific community.) We've seen nothing specific to support the claim that HGT has any significant impact on \"recent\" (in the geologic time scale, anyway) evolution of multicelluar plants and animals; in fact, the abstract specifically states that HGT is essentially absent from the animal kingdom. Instead, perhaps wabbit thinks we're supposed to be amazed that organisms that gather energy via phagocytosis (the literal envelopment of (often biological) matter for breakdown and subsequent matter and energy distribution) can end up with foreign DNA in their genomes...\n \n If you think that this research will support your point, you could get in touch with Per Ahlberg over at IIDB; he's also at Uppsala University and could surely tell you how to contact the author. (Of course, Per himself could probably tell you all you need to know... which you probably wouldn't like.)",
