   "What does the phrase \"live free or die\" mean to the people of New hampshire? \n \n http://www.expressgaynews.com/thelatest/thelatest.cfm?blog_id=12449\n \n \nDante Scala, a professor at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College, said enacting civil unions could play a role in next year's elections.\n \n \"I don't know if you can say the Democrats are running amok, but certainly this is an issue that I think will take a lot of New Hampshire voters by surprise in as much as it wasn't an issue last election,\" said Scala.\n \n But when asked about political fallout in state races, Lynch said, \"I don't think that's a relevant question. I think the question is what is the right thing to do for New Hampshire.\"\n \n State Republican Chairman Fergus Cullen disagreed.\n \n \"You're kidding,\" he said when first told of Lynch's decision.\n \n \"The Democrats are going too far, too fast and Gov. Lynch is going along with them,\" he said. \"These are not the actions of a moderate governor.\"\n\n \n Does this mean that republicans in New Hampshire oppose the gay citizens of New Hampshire living free? Or is it that the republicans want to live free of gay people?",

Most Christians were indoctrinated into their religions and believe in their mind, the things that are told them by their elders. Gay is bad-the Bible says so. Look at the strides the Gay Community has made in the last 30 years, homosexuality was a mental disease 30 years ago. Now we have marriage in 1 state, civil unions in a couple. Have some patience, we are moving along here folks, if we move too fast we will move backwards. We learn best by absorption and teach best by reflection.

He is an atypical example of a fundamentalist christian. He is no more delusional or insane then the rest of evagelical fundametalist christians. He is missguided and has been programed. He trully believes that gay people are inflicted with a disease akin to alcoholism. He, and those like him, believe that as you don't help an alcoholic by giving them more alocohol so you do not help gay people by supporting or accepting thier gay lifestyle. As you try and help an alcoholic through prayer and support so must the gay person be helped to over come their homosexuality through prayer prayer and support. So when Archangel says that he loves gay people and does not want us to go to hell he is being sincere. He trully believes that if we do not repent of our homosexuality we are going to hell. Notice how many times he has asked me to accept christ and learn to know the truth. You must understand also that he is living in a fear based christianity that preaches fear. To Archangel God is this strong scary being who will though you out of the house for the littlest infraction of the rules. Now we as freetinkers can see thorugh the veil of his brainwashing we understand that he is trapped in a world an beliefs that he can not find his way out of. I say do not be angry a Archangel. Do not hate him but pity him and the rest of his kind. Say a prayer and ask God to help open their eyes to see the truth. That gay people are the children of God created as gay and given the wonderful, joyous gift of homosexuality. Say a prayer to God to help them understand that He is not some overbering monster that wants love out of fear but wants us to love him as He loves us unconditionally.",
