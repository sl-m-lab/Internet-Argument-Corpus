   "I don't care if gay marriage is legalized or not. It makes no difference to me at all. I'd rather move out to the middle of nowhere and have nothing to do with society and its aimless anger and pointless rage. The whole argument embarrasses me as a member of a wealthy society, and it should embarrass everyone here. People on both sides of this debate are so screwed up by it. There was a time that I cared, but then I realized: why?? Why care? If everyone just stopped whining about this garbage, we would all come out fine. The \"second class citizen\" debate is the only gay-side debate that holds water. And it's sad because no gain comes of marriage other than what's in other people's eyes. In the eyes of the law? What does that mean?? It's all created by people. So just stop whining about keeping marriage banned or having it unbanned for gays because it really, truly, is pointless. Live your life and love whoever you love. You're all lucky to be able to do that. If you don't think you can love who you want you're a whiny weakling and I have no pity for you. Grow up. Go do something difficult. Honestly. Go a few days on barely any food and see how much this XXXX matters. It doesn't. I promise. If you want something to put your effort into make it something important. You think 90% of the world could give a rats arse about 99.9% of the XXXX that's brought up here? No, of course not. On the great totem pole of importance, this topic is practically underground, for heteros and homos. The heteros are the most embarrassing, but only by a small iota. If you are truly concerned about this topic, consider yourself one of the top 99.9% luckiest people on the planet. I know I am, and I've realized how stupid this whole thing is, which makes it all that much better. If I make just one person here second-guess this debate's importance, I'll be happy.",
