   "Broker,\n \n Can you imagine having a high school, with gang violence so for protection teachers carry concealed weapons on them.\n Lets say 4/10. Its in most cases going to get around to the students which teachers are carrying these. It would be substantially easy for a student to plan and grab a gun from a teacher who posses one. Suddenly a gang member is armed with a gun in a school. \n Most teaches aren't trained to handle situations in which guns should be used in the first place.\n I see no way this idea could work well.....\n (Further elaboration available)\n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

ANd the thing is, we are not talking about arming all of the teachers, just allowing the ones who want to carry guns bring them to school, and they will be trained, and nobody would know whos carrying and whos not.",

COPS!!! People who are trained to carry weapons and deal with violent members of society. Same with prison guards. Teachers are neither, and should not be placed in a role of carrying handguns for any reason. Our schools need better policing by trained professionals, and gang-members or other students who have been shown to have violent behavior need to be kept out of school. Arming teachers is not a solution to the problem of keeping guns out of schools. Many of the schools around where I grew up now have an armed officer on the premesis. Is this good? Well, yes and no. It is certainly good to have a trained professional helping keep children safe, but it is a shame that it has come to this, and it still does present an element of danger having a loaded weapon in school. it would not be hard for a couple of teenagers...remember the trenchcoat mafia?...to subdue a cop and take his gun. And yes, I carry a gun, own several guns, and feel that every person has the right to bear arms...just not in our schools. Where does it stop, if teachers are armed, should not the students have a right to defend themselves from the armed teacher? Suppose an armed teacher gets XXXXXX off at a student and puts a tunnel through his head? Suppose an armed teacher goes nuts and kills geometry class? (most geometry teachers don't have far to go to be nuts anyways) There was an attack in the Capitol building a few years ago, but should congress be allowed to carry Glocks? What about 9/11? Should passengers on aircraft be allowed to carry guns? No, of coarse not. This is exactly what we are trying to prevent, guns in school.",

I think teachers who want to bring guns to school have been watching too much tv. \n \n My teachers were horrible enough without packing heat.It's just yet another reason not to send kids to schools.\n\n \n Not all guns in school were brought there by gang members. Remember I said or others who show violent behavior. Many of the school shootings that occurred over the last 10 years that got so much publicity were done by some little farm boy in Pigsnuckle Arkansas or Rottencrotch Nebraska who does not even know what a gang is. While others, such as here in Miami or NYC, San Diego, LA have been done by gang members. These tend to usually be targeted towards one person, and are more often related to drugs and such than to the fact that the whole school has been picking on them since they were 3. But then again, gang does not have to mean bloods / crips / 88's or the like. Could you not call the \"trenchcoat mafia\" (you know, those model citizen boys in Columbine) a gang? But to not sending kids to school? Poor answer. People drown in water, but my kids can go to the pool. I taught them to swim. There are lifeguards there...and while it is not 100% safe, nothing ever is. There is no such thing as safe, only safer.",
