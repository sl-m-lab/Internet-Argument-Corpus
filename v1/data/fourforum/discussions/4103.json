   "Darwinian natural selection as opposed to the Christian theism of creationism has implications for western civilization like few subjects in the modern world.\n\n Darwinian natural selection isn't opposed to Christianity. In fact, if you took the time to inform yourself you would find that Christian organizations like the ICR and AIG both clearly state that natural selection is a reality and consider it foolish to deny it. In fact, young earth creationists propose evolution by means of natural selection at rates that boggle the minds of evolutionary biologists. They reason that the millions of species of animals that we know of today evolved in very few years after the flood of Noah from the few thousand \"kinds\" that were aboard the ark.\n \n I think that you have confused one of Darwin's theories with the modern biological theory of evolution. It seems that you aren't aware of the fact that Darwin was not the first scientist to state a theory of evolution. Darwin merely restated the simple idea that populations of animals are observed to change over time, an old idea that was accepted by many naturalists of the day. In fact, even Darwin's grandfather wrote about evolution. By the time Darwin sailed on the Beagle, evolution was an old idea and by the time Darwin published On the Origin of Species the idea was 28 years older. Darwin proposed a mechanism of evolution, which is why his idea gained such wide acceptance almost immediately. What Darwin's theory lacked was a mechanism of heredity by which novel characteristics were able to remain in a population and not be overwhelmed by majority of the population that lacked that characteristic. None of the theories of heredity of Darwin's day could account for the origin and increase of new characteristics in a population. That was the greatest challenge to \"Darwinism\" until the early decades of the 20th century when Mendel's work was rediscovered.\n \nThe last vistage of Christian theism in natural science has been reduced the the status of psuedo-science by secular scientists and it all goes back to Darwin.\n\n No. It goes back long before that when scientists went looking for signs of Noah's flood in the geology of the Paris basin and found none. In fact, they found layer after layer of deposits, some marine, some not, but no sign of anything that could have been a global flood.\n \nBefore Darwin every undergraduate studied theology and most zoology and botany was the ciriculum of graduate students.\n\n That's nonsense. When Darwin was at the University of Edinburgh studying medicine, he spent more time studying zoology and geology. His teachers were some of the most respected scientists of the day. Later, when he was at Christ's College, Cambridge studying divinity in preparation entry into the seminary, he actually spent more time studying botany and natural science, under John Henslow (a mineralologist and botanist). Darwin later studied with Adam Sedgwick (a geologist). Both men were leading scientists in their field of the day (both taught at Cambridge). Henslow became a lifelong friend of Darwin and it was his recommendation that gained Darwin the position aboard the Beagle. By the way, both men were ordained in the Chruch of England.\n \nI am interested in discussing the modern sythesis and evolutionary biology with open minded individules interested in the views of creation scientists.\n\n I'm not sure that you actually know what the modern synthesis is since you seem to confuse the theory of evolution with one of its mechanisms, i.e., natural selection. And I pretty much know the views of \"creation scientists.\" I've been reading and listening to them for quite a few years. One thing I do know is that if you begin your study from a dogmatic statement about the truth of Hebrew scripture, nothing from that point on is science.\n \nI myself am a laymen who sees creationism as a branch of Christian apologetics and one vital aspect of given every man who asks the reason for the hope that is within him.\n\n So you admit right from the beginning that creationism is not a scientific endeavor but one of religion. You also falsify your own dichotomy in the next sentence by limiting \"creationism\" to your particular brand of christianity and thus exclude various other myths that are as valid as the mythology of bronze age herdsmen. I don't know what the rest of your sentence has to do with science so I suppose it is religious. It is therefore meaningless in a discussion of science.\n \nMy main issue is with the single common ancestor model and the only other viable explanation for the origin of life on earth, creationsim.\n\n But what form of creationism? Who's god? Are you going to limit the age of the earth to 6,000 years and have a magic being do it all in 6 days? Why don't you specify what form of creationism you advocate?\n \nI see the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species to be a watershed event that permenantly established the single common ancestor model as the foundation of evolutionary biology.\n\n Could be.",

It's not silly at all--any more so than divine creationism. They are equally silly! To say that one is more silly than the other is preposterous! Don't you see the irony in saying my god is better than your god?\n \n \n \nIn the crucible of natural science throughout the Middle Ages, the Scientific Revolution and well into the 19th century theology was the queen of the sciences.\n\n \n It was the queen of the sciences because people were generally brainwashed by the church and scientifically ignorant untill that point. It was not untill the solidification of the SM and more modern systems and tools that the true bogus nature of theology (a laughable science) was revealed. The more educated people become in Science, the more inane religion becomes. \n \n \nNow we subject students to higher math studies that they will most likely never use and speculations about conceptual mechanisms like natural selection that have no practical application. \n\n \n Actually, natural selection is usefull as well as higher maths. It's knowledge. If you want to go around like a bumbling fool all of your life...no, then it's not useful. Any education is useful and beneficial, given that it's objective and real--not fantasy religion. Tons of people use higher math. Engineers, mathematicians, medical field..military... etc. No, it's not useful for the common virginia mountain-fur trader.\n \n Natural Selection is important in any biological field. To say it's useless is absurd, for it's one of the prime foundations for ALL of Biology.\n \n \n \n\n Naturalistic presumption has become sacrosanct in the rhetoric of the professional scientists who have been crystal clear on how they define creationism.\n\n \n It's not part of any rhetoric--evolution is fact.

All they know is their westernized view. Their opinions have no reflection on Biology in that sense. THey should stick to Biology. There is only 1 true way--that's evolution. THe other's are wishful thinking, whether they be the primordial flood, the divine parrot, or magic god who made people from dust.\n \n \n There is no substantive basis for a statement like this anymore then there is a need to accept the single common ancestor myth because there is a change in gene alleles in populations over time.\n \n\n \n You're right~ there's no basis for any creation MYTH. They are all equally fallacious and superfluous, unlike Evolution, which is real, factual, and observed. THere is no common ancestor myth lol. There's no NEED to accept evolution other than it's the best answer to the problem and it's been observed AND it's predictions are successful. It's an excellent theory, unlike religious answers. It's the best application of Occam's Razor.\n \n \n Well lets speculate about how many possible explanations we could concoct if left to supposition. I'm talking about the only two explanations for the origins of life that have ever been entertained as viable empirically testable concepts in modern science.\n\n \n God is not a testable, valid theory for being and origin. It fails the falisfiablily AND verificationism criteria--quite badly. It's also highly subjective. Creationism isn't even a peer reviewed, promulgated theory in any credible community. It wouldn't, and doesn't, last 5 minutes against logic or science. Creationism = continual propagation of the same cut-paste arguments which have been refuted day in and day out, but not heeded.\n \n Creationism ISN'T a powerful force--it's fraudulant repetition.\n \n \n Among the icons (idols) of modern mysticism there is one that reigns supreme. It is the myth of evolution. We scoff at the gods of the anchient pagans as if we were untouched by their superstition and yet we mystify our science with the likes of Darwin, the high priest of natural selection. Darwin taught a fable that started in a warm little pond and through a process that has became known as gradualism (minute changes over eons) all life arose out of a primordial soup.\n\n \n If you think you can compare the scientific method and modern science to mysticism and religion-- you clearly show you are in complete indocrination. YOu have no idea how science works--do you? If you did, you wouldn't say it's mysticism or iconic. There is no such thing in science.\n \n Every scientific idea is heavily peer reviewd, hypotheses are tested from gathered facts and then horrendously attacked for decades untill they crack. If they survive, they survive. NO on egets any emotional attatchment to a theory. A theory only becomes so if it survives the tests of time/attack.\n \n It's  literally  absurd to suggest that there's some icon of science or idol that people venerate. THat's not how science works--of that I am 100% sure.\n \n by the way, Darwin's Ideas in the origin of species were largely incorrect in terms of details--most of which have been fixed and placed through rigorous testing since. Darwin is no GOd and no Idol. No one venerates or worships his work. This is a caricature of science. Religion, on the other hand, DOES do this.\n \n \n Life is not chaotic it is orderly and requires replication. Without this you just have a lot of chemicals mixing in an infinite variety.

This in my opinion is the fundamental first step and it cannot happen peicemeal, it all has to happen all at once.\n \n\n \n Another critical error. Evolution doesn't say life is chaotic. Mutations are random, not natural selection or evolution. It's a heavily guided process.\n \n We have already shown that the primary building blocks of life can be simulated and created. These formed into molecules and cells and so on.\n \n They can even explain how the human eye developled--a recent discovery. It was an extention of light sensitive cells.\n \n \n First off the single common ancestor model has no demonstratable mechanism for how it is even possible. For another thing no substantive reasoning that all scientists use is empirically testable which is why subjective/objective duality is the philosophy of natural science. There is only a need to discern between the substantive reasoning (theoretical) and empirical testing (demonstrative). Objectivism is based on substantive reasoning just like scientific positivism or natural selection for that matter. None of these things are subject to peer review since there is a distinction between subjective and objective reasoning.\n\n \n ********. Utter fraking ****.

   "The vast majority of scientists do not believe in Creationism, and all those people you listed who say there are only 2 varients evolution or creationism--they are't anthropological or theological experts. All they know is their westernized view.\n\n There is a further point that you didn't mention. Even though Futuyma, Gould, Mayr, Dawkins, Dobzhansky stated that there are only two possibilities, one of those possibilities is so unspecific as to be comic. If Futuyma's quote is correct (\"Creation and evolution, between them, exhaust the possible explanations for the origin of living things. Organisms either appeared on the earth fully developed or they did not. If they did not, they must have developed preexisting species by some process of modification. If they did appear in a full developed state, they must have been created by some omnipotent intelligence.\") - I didn't check the book which I own - then it seems to me that Dr. Futuyma was quite unspecific in his comment about \"some omnipotent intelligence.\" In other words, what he seems to be saying is that either the theory of evolution (i.e., life arose by some natural means) is correct or any one of a myriad of creation myths may be correct, even some unspecified omnipotent being of which we know nothing.\n \n I'm willing to make a bet that if I pull Dr. Futuyma's book off of my bookshelf and read that quote in its full context, his meaning of \"creation\" will be so broad as to include Australian aborigine creation mythology, Inuit creation mythology, Inca or Aztec creation mythology, divine parrot creatiion mythology, as well as the mythology of ancient Babelonians, Sumerians, and Hebrews reflected in Genesis. In other words, my bet is that Dr. Futuyma was not specifically referring to American young earth creationism as one of only two possible answers. He is saying that we can learn about our universe by natural means because the events are explainable by natural means, or our universe came about by some miraculous means that is unknowable. If the later, then we should just throw up our hands and declare that goddidit is the answer to any question about physics, cosmology, geology, or biology.\n \nIt was the queen of the sciences because people were generally brainwashed by the church and scientifically ignorant untill that point. It was not untill the solidification of the SM and more modern systems and tools that the true bogus nature of theology (a laughable science) was revealed.\n\n In fact, the period when theology was the \"queen of the sciences\" we generally refer to as the \"dark ages.\" Science in the modern sense is only about 400 years old. You can get a hint of how the \"queen of the sciences\" operated by the fact that Copernicus (a priest) withheld publication of his heliocentric theory until he was quite certain that he was close to death; in fact, legend has it that he saw the first copy on the morning of his death. He knew what the consequences of his theory, that flew in the face of the geocentric dogma of the \"queen of the sciences\", would be. Giordano Bruno and Galileo both found out the consequences of stating theories that were in conflict with the \"queen of the sciences.\" Only when science broke free of the domination by the Church were scientists free to follow the data to the conclusions rather than begin with the conclusions did real science develop and begin to develope real scientific theories. \"Creation science\" still begins with the conclusions and then tries to find data that will fit the dogma, even if it is sometimes contradictory. In \"creation science\" there is no hyopthesis, no prediction, and not test with the power to falsify the hypothesis. \"Creation science\" is pseudoscience.",

   "\"Creation and evolution, between them, exhaust the possible explanations for the origin of living things. Organisms either appeared on the earth fully developed or they did not. If they did not, they must have developed preexisting species by some process of modification. If they did appear in a full developed state, they must have been created by some omnipotent intelligence.\" (D.J.Futuyma, Science on Trial)\n \n There are ulitmatly only two explanations for our origins and even noted secular scientists openly admit this. One thing is an obvious fact from history, in western civilization the only choices are creationism and evolution from a single common ancestor.\n\n \n \n Read this by the same guy:\n http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/futuyma_theory.html\n \n\n Evolution as Fact and Theory\n \n Is evolution a fact, a theory, or a hypothesis? In science, words are often used with precise meanings and connotations that differ from those in everyday life. This is an exceedingly important point, and we will encounter many examples in this book (e.g., fitness, random, correlation). Among such words are hypothesis and theory. People often speak of a \"mere\" hypothesis (as in \"it is merely a hypothesis that smoking causes cancer\") as if it were an opirtion unsupported by evidence. In science, however, a hypothesis is an informed statement of what might be true. It may be poorly supported, especially at first, but as we have seen, it can gain support to the point at which it is effectively a fact. For Copernicus, the revolution of the earth around the sun was a hypothesis with modest support; for us, it is a hypothesis with strong support. \n ...\n In light of the preceding discussion, evolution is a scientific fact. But it is explained by evolutionary theory. In The Origin of Species, Darwin propounded two large hypotheses. One was descent, with modification, from common ancestors, or, for simplicity, the hypothesis of descent with modification. I will also refer to this as the \"historical reality of evolution.\" The other large hypothesis was Darwin's proposed cause for descent with modification: that natural selection sorts among hereditary variations.\n",

   "Darwinian natural selection isn't opposed to Christianity. In fact, if you took the time to inform yourself you would find that Christian organizations like the ICR and AIG both clearly state that natural selection is a reality and consider it foolish to deny it. In fact, young earth creationists propose evolution by means of natural selection at rates that boggle the minds of evolutionary biologists. They reason that the millions of species of animals that we know of today evolved in very few years after the flood of Noah from the few thousand \"kinds\" that were aboard the ark.\n\n \n That's completly beside the point:\n \n \"I can entertain no doubt, after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which I am capable, that the view which most naturalists until recently entertained, and which I formerly entertained--namely, that each species has been independently created--is erroneous.\"\n \n (Intro to Origin of Species 6th ed, C. Darwin)\n \n Dawian calls the essense of species undiscoverable, the orgin of species the mystery of mysteries and confesses profound ignorance with regards to the mutual realtions 'innumerable inhabitants of the world during the many past geological epochs in its history'. There is one thing he is absolutly certain of along with other naturalists, they were not independantly created. \n \n \"The purpse of On the Origin of Species was not to introduce the concept of evolution; it was to debunk the concept of supernatural intelligence-the idea that the universe is the result of an idea\"\n \n (The Metaphysical Club, Louis Menand)\n \n My thing is not evolutionary biology, its philosophy and history that gets me going. Darwin's work was nothing more then a philisophical treatise that enjoyed tremendous success from the very beginning. At the very same time a monk with a flare for teaching was doing the real work of science and was all but ignored. G. Mendel, the father of genetics, produced two scientific laws that are still the foundation of modern genetics. Darwins work was debunked by scientists and was all but forgotten for half a century untill Mendel's work was redisovered and genetics began to grow as an independant discipline. Darwin was a philosopher and it was not until Mayr sythesised Mendel's science with Darwin's metaphysics that natural selection was introduced into natural science. Darwin piggybacked on the work of a creationist which he had done throughout his career. \n \n \n \nI think that you have confused one of Darwin's theories with the modern biological theory of evolution. It seems that you aren't aware of the fact that Darwin was not the first scientist to state a theory of evolution. Darwin merely restated the simple idea that populations of animals are observed to change over time, an old idea that was accepted by many naturalists of the day. In fact, even Darwin's grandfather wrote about evolution. By the time Darwin sailed on the Beagle, evolution was an old idea and by the time Darwin published On the Origin of Species the idea was 28 years older. Darwin proposed a mechanism of evolution, which is why his idea gained such wide acceptance almost immediately. What Darwin's theory lacked was a mechanism of heredity by which novel characteristics were able to remain in a population and not be overwhelmed by majority of the population that lacked that characteristic. None of the theories of heredity of Darwin's day could account for the origin and increase of new characteristics in a population. That was the greatest challenge to \"Darwinism\" until the early decades of the 20th century when Mendel's work was rediscovered.\n\n \n I am well aware that Darwin was not the first to introduce the idea of evolution since he barely mentions it in his book. The belief that species evolve is not incompatible with a belief in divine creation. What he introduced was materialism, the single common ancestor from a warm little pond, and the stretching of descent with modification over millions of generations. He in effect mystified the time tested concepts of observation and demonstration by postulating an imagined morphology. \n \n \nNo. It goes back long before that when scientists went looking for signs of Noah's flood in the geology of the Paris basin and found none. In fact, they found layer after layer of deposits, some marine, some not, but no sign of anything that could have been a global flood.\n\n \n Gradualism had been popularized by Jean Baptiste Lamark calling progressive adaptation. George Cuvier had made the observation theat a series of catastrophes had led to geologic changes and given his vast knowledge of animal anatomy he identified fossil specimans by comparing them to living creatures. For Cuvier each layer of rock represented a seperated destructive event, followed by a new influx of life. \n \n Darwin on his voyage on the Beagle was reading a book by Charles Lyell that proposed uniformitarianism. This suggested a slow steady gradual process and they had went a long way to convince people that evolution was a viable concept. Darwin simply applied these ideas and concepts to naturalist philisophy. \n \n \nThat's nonsense. When Darwin was at the University of Edinburgh studying medicine, he spent more time studying zoology and geology. His teachers were some of the most respected scientists of the day. Later, when he was at Christ's College, Cambridge studying divinity in preparation entry into the seminary, he actually spent more time studying botany and natural science, under John Henslow (a mineralologist and botanist). Darwin later studied with Adam Sedgwick (a geologist). Both men were leading scientists in their field of the day (both taught at Cambridge). Henslow became a lifelong friend of Darwin and it was his recommendation that gained Darwin the position aboard the Beagle. By the way, both men were ordained in the Chruch of England.\n\n \n Darwin studied medicial science for a while and he was a poor student. He learned taxiderma from John Edmonstone who told him about the tropical rain forests of South America. Darwin never had much interest in his studies but he did participate in the debates that were popular there, natural causes verses divine intervention. He attended some of Henslows lectures and they became close friends but he never was much of a student and spent most of his time collecting beetles. Darwin was ordained but he never showed any indication that he was anything but a confirmed naturalist. \n \n \nI'm not sure that you actually know what the modern synthesis is since you seem to confuse the theory of evolution with one of its mechanisms, i.e., natural selection. And I pretty much know the views of \"creation scientists.\" I've been reading and listening to them for quite a few years. One thing I do know is that if you begin your study from a dogmatic statement about the truth of Hebrew scripture, nothing from that point on is science.\n\n \n I am well aware of the modern synthesis and its based on the science of creationism and the metaphysics of Darwin. Darwin was the first to introduce historicity into natural science and he did it by assuming naturalistic causes. His philosophy was siezed by Nietzsche who described life as a struggle to survive (Kampf). Marx liked Darwinian philosophy so much he wanted to dedicate Das Capitol but Darwin's wife, now a widow, wouldn't allow him to. Darwinism is far from a scientific theory it is in fact only a concept based on the idea of survival of the fittest:\n \n \"Over against all this, the v\u00f6lkisch concept of the world recognizes that the primordial racial elements are of the greatest significance for mankind. In principle, the State is looked upon only as a means to an end and this end is the conservation of the racial characteristics of mankind. Therefore on the v\u00f6lkisch principle we cannot admit that one race is equal to another. By recognizing that they are different, the v\u00f6lkisch concept separates mankind into races of superior and inferior quality.\"\n \n Mein Kamph \n \n \"Finally, it may not be a logical deduction, but to my imagination it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its foster-brothers, ants making slaves, the larvae of ichneumonidae feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars, not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law leading to the advancement of all organic beings--namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.\"\n \n (Darwins Origin of Species, Ch. 8 Instinct)\n \n Is it a coincidence that the two statements are identical? You tell me.\n \n \n \n \n \nSo you admit right from the beginning that creationism is not a scientific endeavor but one of religion. You also falsify your own dichotomy in the next sentence by limiting \"creationism\" to your particular brand of christianity and thus exclude various other myths that are as valid as the mythology of bronze age herdsmen. I don't know what the rest of your sentence has to do with science so I suppose it is religious. It is therefore meaningless in a discussion of science.\n\n \n I admit no such thing, creationism is a view of nature that accepts God's role in creation. Now as far as the modern mythology of the single common ancestor it has never demonstrated a valid mechanism for the gradualism of Darwin.\n \n \"Today our duty is to destroy the myth of evolution, considered as a simple, understood, and explained phenomenon which keeps rapidly unfolding before us. ..The deceit is sometimes unconscious, but not always, since some people, owing to their sectarianism, purposely overlook reality and refuse to acknowledge the inadequacies and falsity of their beliefs\" \n \n (Grasse, Pierre-Paul, Evolution of Living Organisms)\n \n \nBut what form of creationism? Who's god? Are you going to limit the age of the earth to 6,000 years and have a magic being do it all in 6 days? Why don't you specify what form of creationism you advocate?\n \n Could be.\n\n \n We will get into that and allready have, lets stick with the prevailing modern view for the time being. Secularism is a virus and its patented absurdities stem from the presumption of naturalistic causes to the exclusion of divine intervention. Make no mistake, natural selection is a concept that was defined by Darwin to argue against special creation. It has never been good for anything else.",

Such men as Fisher, Haldane, Wright, Mayr, Julian Huxley, Stebbins, Simpson and Dobzhansky. The definition of evolution as arrived at during this time is still the definition of evolution today. Virtually every biologist accepts the modern synthesis, subject only to new information and theory added since the 40s.\n \n Your lack of knowledge of the topic make reading your comments a waste of time.",

He [Mendel] was a good scientist, but he was also a \"creationist\" which hampered his scientific discovery: his faith blinded him to the fact that he had found the mechanism by which natural selection occurs.\n\n Actually that may not be entirely true. Among Darwin's correspondence (he seems to have kept almost everything - both received and copies of letters sent) was found a copy of Mendel's paper of 1865, Experiments on Plant Hybridization. The paper appears to have been sent by Mendel himself. Darwin was by this time recognized the world over as a leading naturalist. He received papers and letters from scientists (and some from nutcases too) from around the world. One of these was, of course, Alfred Russel Wallace in 1858. But it seems that Darwin never even read Mendel's paper. It was filed and there are no notes on the pages that Darwin was in the habit of making as he read manuscripts. It seems that Darwin had in his hands the very paper that would have explained his \"gemmules\" of inheritence and he never knew it. But the fact that Mendel sent his paper to Darwin could indicate that Mendel may have read On the Origin of Species and recognized the significance of his own work.\n \nModern biology is based upon the work of these two, plus a multitude of others. To try and suggest that their individual opinions somehow provide two opposing aspects of modern biology is stupidity beyond belief.\n\n Exactly. I mentioned several of the men who actually hammered out the modern synthesis in its initial form in my previous reply to Phaedrus. Note that Phaedrus is completely unaware that \"creation science\" is an invention of the 20th century. It was invented by men like the evangelist Harry Rimmer and the 7th Day Adventist George McCready Price and his flood geology, and finally by the likes of Dr. Henry M. Morris, who adopted wholesale McCready's flood geology.\n \n Mendel may have believed in creation by God, but that didn't make him a \"creation scientist.\" Mendel didn't base any of his conclusions on the first book of the Bible. Mendel actually seems to have applied the scientific method.\n \n Again, Phaedrus' stuff isn't worth reading. It is quite evident that he knows his conclusions before he begins his study. For example, he commented that he was aware that Darwin was not the first to introduce the idea of evolutiion since he barely mentioned it in his book. Apparently Phaedrus hasn't read the book. And he further doesn't even understand that \"evolution\" wasn't even Darwin's term and Darwin didn't like it applied to his theories. It was actually popularized by T.H. Huxley, a naturalist, Darwin's friend, and the grandfather of Julian Huxley (a geneticist) who was one of those responsible for the modern synthesis.",

   "...since no one knows the difference between a philososphy of science and a demonstration...\n\n Did it strike anyone else as hilariously funny that the above statement came from someone who declares that what Mendel did was \"creation science\" and that Darwin wrote a book of philosophy?\n \n Remember, this is the guy who said that Darwin hardly mentioned evolution in his book.\n \nThere is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved.\n\n Well, there it is! The last word of the last sentence of the 1st edition, the only occurence of any form of the word, is \"evolved.\" Darwin never used the word \"evolution\" in any of the six editions of \"Origins.\" Isn't it funny that someone who is representing to speak with authority about Darwin doesn't know that? In fact, in the 6th edition, the word evolved appears six times - once in a direct quote, twice in indirect quotes of what others have said, and twice in Darwin's actual text. Of course the 6th time is the last word of the book.\n \n And yet, anyone who has actually read the book knows that it is about evolution. Just look at the chapter titles - Variation Under Domestication, Variation Under Nature, Struggle for Existence, Natural Selection, Laws of Variation. And yet this is claimed to be philosophy.\n \n By the way, Close_slave_can. Not even educated young earth creationists believe that God created each species independently anymore. They recognize the problems involved in loading millions of species onto that small ark - not enough time, not enough room. So the answer is hyperevolution of millions of species from a few \"kinds.\"",

   "For one thing a philisophical argument is not proof, in fact natural selection is an option to, not a logical disproof of special creation. It does follow that if God is to be excluded for explanations of the origin of life when this is 'the mystery of mysteries' that such rejections are based on apriori naturalistic assumptions. \nWhen you get a spare moment, could you please rewrite the above in English? I have absolutely no idea what you are trying to say here.\n \n \nMendel, like most scientists of his day, was a creationist.\nWhat do you mean by \"creationist\"? If you mean a 6,000 year old Earth believing YEC, then you talk nonsense: most scientists accepted the earth was old and that life had evolved over a long period of time before Darwin and Mendel published their findings.\n \n \nDarwin's work was simply philisophical naturalism and proved useless for any kind of scientific demonstration.\nOh dear, you really do not have a clue what you are talking about. It finally provided the mechanism for the evolution of life that was known to have occured. That mechanism was natural selection. It is potentially naturalist, but not exclusively so.\n \n \nMendel's laws segregation and independent assortment (now better understood as meiosis) demonstrated empirically what was a mystery to Darwin...genetics. \nYep, that is the sad thing about Mendel's work: he had uncovered the driving force of natural slection at the same time as others hit upon the idea of natural selection, yet he was ignored.\n \n \nThe modern synthesis focused on the work of these two just as the medieval synthesis focused on Aristotle and Scripture. What do you think synthesis means? \n\"The modern synthesis\" is philosophical gibberish. Modern biology is far far far more than a mere synthesis of Darwin and Mendel's discoveries.\n \n \nI am still waiting for a substantive reply but I wont hold my breath.\nYou have receieved many of them. You just refuse to accept them as such as they point out the flaws in your opening argument. Fix the flaws and then you might be able to have a worthwhile debate.\n \n \nI expected childish taunts and pedantic satire and that was what I got.\nIndeed, we aim to tailor our replies to the intellectual level of the poster.\n \n \nWhat I was hoping to discuss was Darwin and the rise of secularism\nThen you should have posted an opening statement about Darwin and the rise of secularism, rather than the error-riddled piece of irrelevence that you chose to post instead.\n \n Whether Darwin's publications were one of the major contributors to the growth in secularism in the western world is an interesting question. Sadly you have yet to demonstrate that you have a sufficient grasp of the topic to discuss it in a meaningful way though. There is a book of articles by Gould that considers this very issue and would be a good place for you to start your research (along with reading Darwin's books of course). I can't remember the title off the top of my head, but I'll dig it out this evening and post it for you.",

Particulate inheritance (i.e discrete genes) makes perfect sense with Darwin's theory though.\n \n As an aside, Mendel fudged his results quite impressively to get the nice ratios - sadly in the real world to get these are near impossible to get due to other factors involved. All credit to him for noticing the ratios hidden behind these, but he must have fiddled them a bit to bring them nearer to the theorectical result",

As I said before, a lot has been added since then but the synthesis was much more than gibberish, although it, like Darwin's actual writing, is interesting mainly from an historical standpoint.\n \n And Tastyfish, Darwin was well aware that the theory of blending inheritance was incorrect.

   "@Phaedrus\n You made a quote from Darwin \n \n \"Although much remains obscure, and will long remain obscure, I can entertain no doubt, after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which I am capable, that the view which most naturalists until recently entertained, and which I formerly entertained--namely, that each species has been independently created--is erroneous.\" \n (Darwin, Origin of Species)\n \n Could you please tell me how this quote supports your ideas about Darwin being a high preist of naturalism preaching his alternate theology? Could such a sentence convince anyone to turn from God? Do you think he means naturalist in the same sense as you do?\n\n \n Darwin's views were not rooted in natural science, they were based on philisophical naturalism. \n \n 'ORGANIC Life beneath the shoreless waves\n Was born and nurs'd in Ocean's pearly caves;\n First forms minute, unseen by spheric glass,\n Move on the mud, or pierce the watery mass; \n These, as successive generations bloom,\n New powers acquire and larger limbs assume;\n Whence countless groups of vegetation spring,\n And, breathing realms of fin, and feet, and wing.\n \n (Erasmus Darwin 1731-1802)\n \n To this day Darwinian's allude to religious imagary, for example, the Ancerstors Tale by Richard Darwkins, is described as a pilgrimage. The Darwin's naturalism has been noted repeatedly and it is known to be opposed to divine omnipotence.\n \n \"The only distinct meaning of the word 'natural' is STATED, FIXED or SETTLED; since what is natural as much requires and presupposes an intelligent agent to render it so, i.e., to effect it continually or at stated times, as what is supernatural or miraculous does to effect it for once.\" \n Butler: \"Analogy of Revealed Religion\" \n \n One of the primary architects was Ernst Mayr who emphasised his work defining in exclusivly naturalistic terms calling it the secular view of modern life. He credited Charles Darwin for being the one most responsible for the rise of the secular view.\n \n \"Darwin founded a new branch of life science, evolutionary biology. Four of his contributions to evolutionary biology are especially important, as they held considerable sway beyond that discipline. The first is the non-constancy of species, or the modern conception of evolution itself. The second is the notion of branching evolution, implying the common descent of all species of living things on earth from a single unique origin. Up until 1859, all evolutionary proposals, such as that of naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, instead endorsed linear evolution, a teleological march toward greater perfection that had been in vogue since Aristotle's concept of Scala Naturae, the chain of being. Darwin further noted that evolution must be gradual, with no major breaks or discontinuities. Finally, he reasoned that the mechanism of evolution was natural selection. \"\n \n (Ernst Mayr, Darwin's Influence on Modern Thought)\n \n Darwin's naturalism is credited for giving rise to both the single common ancestor model and gradualism in modern biology. What is most important to realize here is that it is nothing more then philisophical arguments against creationism that was the prevailing view of scientists up untill that time.",

There is a great deal more to it but Darwin also proposed the gradualism that has become so much a part of evolutionary biology. In answer to your question, Darwin was specificlly making an argument against special creation and natural selection has allways been an argument against special creation. \n \n This is clear in the Origin of Species from the introduction to the conclusion. From the statements of leading evolutionists like Gould and Dawkins there are theological statements at the heart of their reasoning. Evolution defined as the change in gene frequencies in populations over time is not a problem for any creationist I know of in modern times or history. The single common ancestor model on the other hand flatly rejects God as an explanation for the origin of life as a matter of course.

   "Would it supprise anyone to know that I can accept evolution, natural selection, and even macroevolution and still not feel compeled to give up YEC creationism. What is more I don't see any reason why my theology would change on iota if tommorow I woke up and believed natural history as it is taught in modern biology is absolutly true and Genesis is just poetic prose? None of this has anything to do with Christian theism, consider this. When Abraham was told that he was going to have a son he laughed. When his wife Sarah heared the same promise she laughed. When their son was actually born a year later they named him Issac which means 'she laughed'. Now when God made the promise and Abraham laughed it says that he belived that the one who made the promise was faithfull, and it was credited to him for righteousness. \n \n My point is simply this, none of this has anything to do with why I'm interested in creationism. It offers an interesting possibility for natural science particularly with regards to genetics. Just consider this one point, just suppose for the sake of argument, that creatures were fully formed at the original creation with pristine genomes and all living creatures descended from them. Over time you get this vast amount of variation but the original genome has been damaged along the way but wouldn't you expect there be a way to reclaim what was left of the original genome?\n \n At any rate, that is the idea I got stuck on and you can trust me when I say I am no religious zealot. I am just frustrated that creationists don't even seem aware of the potential here for objective testing. This debate like the hundreds of others I have had will run its course and eventually we will get tired of one anothers arguments. Bottomline, I think creationism is testable and I think I know how.\n \n If you guys are interested in kicking this idea around I'll check back and I can give you the specifics then.
