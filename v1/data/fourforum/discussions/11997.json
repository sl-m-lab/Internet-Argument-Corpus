   "Democrats have always labled themselves as representatives of the \"middle class\", while accusing Republicans of only being for \"the rich\". \n \n Republicans have always labeled themselves as champions of small government - that domestic small government benefits everyone, not just the rich, while accusing the Democrats of favoring big government. \n \n Is it not curious that congressional Democrats favor government bailouts funded by the middle class for \"rich\" auto executives, (in the name of saving jobs) while congressional Republicans generally oppose it? \n \n It's becoming more and more clear what's actually going on with this bailout attempt. \n \n The Environmental Motor Company - WSJ.com\n \n \n...............All of this shows that Democrats don't merely want to save jobs. They want an entirely different American auto industry that serves goals other than selling cars to consumers. The green lobbies have disliked Detroit for decades -- for resisting fleet mileage standards and having the audacity to make SUVs, trucks and other vehicles that people have wanted to buy but that violate modern environmental pieties. For the greens, the bailout is their main chance to remake Detroit according to their dictates.\n \n This means that if a bailout proceeds Americans would be signing up for much more than a short-term financial fix, a la Chrysler in 1979. Once Congress starts investing in its green visions for Detroit, it isn't likely to give up easily or stop at $50 billion. If the Environmental Motor Company's cars don't sell well enough to earn a profit, then something else would have to be done to vindicate the investments. Taxpayer loans and other subsidies would have to float the companies until Americans wise up or Congress forces consumers to buy them. Taxpayers should get ready to own a piece of Detroit for a very long time. \n\n \n How does Congress \"force\" consumers to buy environmental cars, hmmm? If you said regulate EXISTING ONES out of existance with new environmental laws, go to the head of the class. \n \n If you're a member of the middle class who doesn't like the idea of having your current car rendered useless by a government controlled auto industry, I'd suggest you contact your congressmen and tell them to oppose the auto industry bailout.",

The Republicans have said they championed small government, yet under Bush Jr and Reagan, they expanded government to levels that approached and went beyond the size of the government under FDR during WWII. Republicans are shams when they claim they want smaller government. As for the bailout, there are a number of legislators from BOTH sides who are for and against it. \n \n \nHow does Congress \"force\" consumers to buy environmental cars, hmmm? If you said regulate EXISTING ONES out of existance with new environmental laws, go to the head of the class.\n\n \n Come again? Perhaps you failed to take the lessons of the oil embargo to heart? The Auto Industry pledged itself to building efficient, non-gas guzzling cars. Then oil prices dropped. And the whole \"get off oil\" mantra died. The bailout does force the big three to allocate resources to actually building gas sipping, efficient cars. While this is clearly the least pleasant way of doing it, there doesn't seem to be much of a choice. And the auto industry more or less acknowledges this. They are shutting down or retooling huge numbers of factories and machines to make efficient vehicles. The Chevy brand is more or less pinning its future on the Volt which is a far cry from the SUVs and Trucks of Detroit. \n \n \nIf you're a member of the middle class who doesn't like the idea of having your current car rendered useless by a government controlled auto industry, I'd suggest you contact your congressmen and tell them to oppose the auto industry bailout.\n\n \n Useless? Would you call the catalytic converter useless? How about seat belts? How about safety seats? How about tempered glass? How about all of the safety features we now expect as standard that came about from regulation? \n \n If you don't want your car's manufacture to go belly up, rendering your warranty and all of those services void, then write your congress member to do something other then sit on their hands. \n \n Oh my. That opinion piece is truly retarded:\n \n \nIf Congress wants to ease the immediate burden on Detroit, it could also ease the onerous fleet-mileage standards (CAFE rules) that force the companies to make cars domestically that are unprofitable. A mere tweak would help a lot -- for example, simply allow Detroit to meet CAFE standards by counting the cars it makes at home and abroad. This alone might save Chrysler from bankruptcy. But Congress won't budge on that simple change.\n\n \n Really? The logic is to allow the big 3 to make cars with horrible gas mileages in the idea that those would reduce costs? Perhaps, but how many people do you know who, right now, with extreme gas prices in mind, are going to commit to a purchase of a highly inefficient vehicle? \n \n That idiotic logic would argue that dropping the additional fees on Hummers right now would cause them to fly off the lots. Way to ignore the most basics of economics. Since, you, Marc, have been living in a box, some of the biggest sellers in the past 5 years have been cars with exceedingly high miles per gallons. Not low ones. Getting rid of CAFE standards is not a way to bring the big 3 into the black. \n \n However, the piece is right that GM and Chrysler, not so much Ford have their best chance under Chapter 11. They need to get rid of all of their long term liabilities, shed many unprofitable segments and products and get down to producing a few, good products. That all assuming they can make it out of bankruptcy. \n \n Would you buy a car from a bankrupt manufacturer?",
