It is our experiences and memories, the experiences stored in our brain, that make us who we are. If all of these memories and experiences were somehow destroyed permanently, we would no longer be 'us'. \n So how sensible is it to call a fetus a 'person'? It can be called no such thing by any meaningful definition of the word. It is a bundle of human cells forming a human being, with the POTENTIAL to become a 'person'. \n \n When a person is murdered, what are we mourning the loss of? THEM. And who are THEY? Their experiences, which form their personality. It would make no sense to mourn the loss of a human with no memories or experiences - although we may mourn the loss of a chance to cure them, we are not actually mourning the loss of that creature in it's present state. \n \n So what are we mourning when a fetus is destroyed? The loss of a potential life.\n But if we think about it logically, one potential life is no better of worse than any other, since it is only potential. Therefore, whether the potential life becomes a reality hardly matters, since any other one will do just as well.",

If you had died before you were 7 months, you wouldnt really have had any memories or experiences. The people around you that knew that you existed would mourn you wouldnt they? When you have a baby inside of your stomach, or your child is in someone elses starting on it's way into becoming a \"person\" and the whole miracle is STOPPED, there is definately something to mourn. Maybe they aren't a person yet but, they do have potential to become one. Possibilities is the word. The reason for why I am pro choice is because I have had to work with women who have went through it.

   "If by 'person' you mean a human being, then what constitutes a human being is rational individual entity, living being with a volitional consciousness (free will). \n \n \"Anti-abortionists views claim that the fetus is a human being and, although within and part of the mother, it has individual rights. This view of the unborn fetus fails to make two vital distinctions-the metaphysical difference between the actual and the potential and between an entity and its parts. \n \n The fetus is physically within the mother and connected to her via the placenta and umbilical chord. It is directly physically dependent on the mother for all of its life sustaining needs-oxygen, energy and safety from the external environment. The relationship between mother and fetus is not that of two distinct human entities, but rather that of an independent human being (the mother) with rights and a dependent physical appendage, something that is physically within and part of the mother and therefore cannot have individual rights.\" Richard G. Parker, MD\n \n The issue of abortion does center on the question of where rights begin, which is when a human being does exist, not when it might. \n An unborn embryo or fetus is not a human being. It is a clump of cells. It will not become a human being until childbirth when the fetus and umbilical cord is removed from the mother. Then it is an individual entity that has rights.\n \n To answer the questions about the Peterson case try this website: http://www.courttv.com/news/2003/0326/fetalhomicide_ctv.html\n \"An assault three decades ago paved the way for a fetal homicide law now being used to prosecute Scott Peterson. Because of the brutal attack on Keeler, California amended its homicide statute to include the killing of a fetus by a third party. Peterson was charged with two counts of murder, one for his wife, Laci, who was seven months pregnant at the time of her disappearance, and one for their unborn son, Conner. \n \n There are fetal homicide laws on the books in more than two dozen states, but they vary widely. In some states, such as Missouri and Minnesota, a fetus is considered a living thing at conception. In others, like Georgia and Michigan, a fetus is only protected after \"quickening\" - when movement is first felt in the womb - occurs.\n \n There are fetal homicide laws on the books in more than two dozen states, but they vary widely.

   "Thank you for your reply. I'm glad that you are against partial-birth abortions, it is incomprehensible to me to think that a newborn is now human because it moved 8 inches(or so) and now has a belly button!\n \n What are the characteristics of being human?\n \n The ball wasn't going to be part of the snowman, it was going to become a bigger ball. Or, it was a snowman - a little snowman that looked somewhat different, because stuff was still being added to it. What I am saying is that the sperm and egg are potential, but the fetus is actual, because it is in motion, it is growing and changing. The sperm isn't doing anything by itself. You have to do something to cause it to change and grow, while with the fetus, you have to do something to stop it from growing.\n \n Dependency is an awfully tricky subject. There are precious few people who are truly independent. They would have to have all the knowledge and ability to survive with no human contact, help, nothing made by another human. I would not survive long by myself in the wilderness. \n \n You could take it further and say that no-one is truly independent unless they can survive with ONLY things they have made (so they would have to create their own universe, a world to live on, oxygen, things to eat, and so on)\n \n And then there are preemies, and newborns.

   "The ball wasn't going to be part of the snowman, it was going to become a bigger ball. Or, it was a snowman - a little snowman that looked somewhat different, because stuff was still being added to it. What I am saying is that the sperm and egg are potential, but the fetus is actual, because it is in motion, it is growing and changing. The sperm isn't doing anything by itself. You have to do something to cause it to change and grow, while with the fetus, you have to do something to stop it from growing.\n\n \n Everything is heading towards becoming something. You say that the egg and sperm are potential. They are going to become the fetus. So they have the potential of becoming the fetus. You say the fetus is actual life. I would ask why the fetus isn't potential as well because there is still another stage before it is a self sustaining living thing. Also note the fetus isn't going to do anything by itself either. It needs a host.\n \n I agree with your assessment that a fetus and sperm are different in that the sperm is nothing without an action and the fetus will be unless an action is taken. Well stated, I can't disagree with the fact that the fetus should become something. It comes down to my unconvincing opinion that the fetus is still not life because it is as brain dead as any other cell in the body. Killing your liver isn't killing a living thing although those cells are as much alive as a newly formed fetus.\n \n \nDependency is an awfully tricky subject. There are precious few people who are truly independent. They would have to have all the knowledge and ability to survive with no human contact, help, nothing made by another human. I would not survive long by myself in the wilderness.\n \n You could take it further and say that no-one is truly independent unless they can survive with ONLY things they have made (so they would have to create their own universe, a world to live on, oxygen, things to eat, and so on)\n \n And then there are preemies, and newborns. The newborn depends on the mother for food. Pretty much any baby can be taken out of the mother weeks or months before birth would have happened - so now it's more human than one that was left in?\n \n Someone on life-support is just as dependent as a fetus.

So I guess when I say potential, I mean the potential of the sperm or egg to join and become something which now has the capability of, and in fact is, becoming a human adult.\n \n I don't think a newborn is self sustaining.

However, the unborn baby develops pretty fast. I have seen some pictures of aborted babies and they are so heart-wrenching because they look so human. The heartbeat begins between the 18th and 25th day, electrical brainwaves as early as the 40th day.

I have one more question: You said you are against partial-birth, but you're arguments about dependency would say that the baby isn't human until it's breathing. Are you arguing for dependency determining humanness because you believe it, or because my arguments about independence seemed questionable to you?",

You make a good point though. If they don't have higher brain functions then this also sets them apart from humans. Still it also sets them apart from the brain dead. They are in the gray area. If this were suddenly to occur to me, would I want to still be labeled as the same person I am today? Absolutely not. In this way they are brain dead.

As you already know, I believe brain life = life. So of course brain dead = dead. The human is already dead. There is nothing left to kill. There is a stack of cells remaining from when the human was alive but will surely die as well since the brain can no longer care for it.\n \n Look at it this way. If the person is brain dead then 100 years ago they would have already been dead. Clearly it is Gods purpose for them to be dead. They are probably caught in an abyss somewhere between life and the afterlife until their body finally dies and that probably isn't what they want anyways.

That is life, I won't deny that, but it is not human life in my view.\n \n I've stated before that a person in a coma is still alive because that is not brain death. Asleep is also not brain death. People who are brain dead are no longer human although they are still alive. They can return to a human state if they regain the ability to think but at the time that they are brain dead they are missing a key element in what makes a human and therefore I cannot view them as being that different from a dead person.\n \n I am not trying to ignore your arguments but if I happen to do so then please point that out to me. I've made arguments very similar to this one in the Abortion forums many times and through those debates I have evolved my original opinion on abortion around the idea that human life requires the ability of higher level thinking. I am not married to this idea however so I encourage you to ask me tough questions and I will respond to them and hopefully I will learn more about my own feelings and ideas and how well they can stand up against logic.",

   "Uh, scientifically, philisophically, and logically speaking, no.\n\n \n Philosophically and logically speaking you are incorrect IMO.\n \n \nBut they are human life (as explained). \n\n \n No they do not. They are missing the key component of the mind.\n \n Anyways, you are debating the wrong points here for this debate. We are trying to determine what human life is defined as.\n \n \nMy personal opinion is that homosexuals are not human. Therefore, I believe that we can kill homosexuals. Is this acceptable? No, because it's not true. Homosexuals are human, scientifically. But of course, I can still have a personal opinion. \n\n \n You have your opinion there and I have mine here. If you believe that we can kill homosexuals then that is your opinion just as it is legally allowable to kill a brain dead person and that is just a bunch of opinions mixed together to form a standard. Does that make either one acceptable by everyone? Absolutely not and maybe not even acceptable by the majority.\n \n Of course you can still have your opinion and if you have enough evidence to back up your claim then you can have a legitimate debate. My debate is that I believe human life cannot exist without the mind. I can show in vague ways by just looking at a brain dead person. They are no longer able to know that they exist and that is one thing I can do therefore there is a difference between us. \"I think therefore I am\". Therefore they are not. If they are not then something is missing and I believe that something is key to human life. Don't get me wrong and think for a second that what I am stating here is fact, but also don't assume that your \"scientifically, philosophically, and logically\" is fact either. It is just a bunch of opinions brought together to form a norm and there is no reason that it cannot be proven wrong in certain situations or even across the board. We are debating an idea here and ideas are tough to prove either way especially ones based on emotions, morals, and individuals.\n \n \nIt is my personal opinion that the Koran war never happened. The majority of the population agrees that it did happen, but my personal opinion is that it did not. How ludicrous!\n\n \n What point are you trying to make here? Are you trying to state that it is crazy to go against the majority? The Korean War isn't just an idea, it was an event. An event is provable much easier than an idea. If you want an example of this the majority of the world believes the Christian/Jewish God exists. Try to get the Muslims to understand this. The reason you cannot is because it is just an idea and really isn't provable. Try to prove to a kid that Santa doesn't exist. It is harder to prove an idea than it is an event.\n \n \nThen what's the point of debating? If you base your argument solely on what you personally believe, we can't get anywhere! I obviously cannot change your mind because your opinion is based on what you feel. Feelings do not overrun scientific facts!\n\n \n You base your personal believe on the beliefs of others. Does this make your opinion anymore solid than mine?\n \n Besides, we are not debating anything except personal opinion here. Your personal opinion is that scientists are correct while mine is that my logic is correct. You seem to be having a hard time seeing that our debate here is about our personal opinions and therefore we should be focusing on statement such as \"scientifically, philosophically, and logically speaking, no\" because I can just respond back \"scientifically, philosophically, and logically speaking, yes\" because I can listen to different ways of thinking in all these fields than you have especially since you provided no examples of either why you believe you are right or why science, philosophy, and logic is right or whose work you are looking at.\n \n Feelings do not overrun scientific facts? Science once said that hot flashes were just feelings that didn't exist. Recently science has shown that hot flashes are actual events and not just feelings. In this case feelings were right while science was wrong. Science is an ever changing opinion in search of the truth. You can make guesses on what human life is but you cannot prove what human life is. I have little doubt that scientists will cringe at the idea of modifying the human mind to create super humans because that is changing what we are. We would then become superhuman life just as we would if our bodies were replaced completely with artificial components. What humans are can be modified based on the mind and body. I bet science would also commonly characterize a monkey as a half-monkey, half-dog if a dog brain were to be put into a monkey. This again would show how the mind can determine what type of being is present.\n \n Basically I don't believe your stance that science backs you up completely and not me at all is inaccurate. I also don't believe this is what we should be debating because science itself will not have an answer to this question. The question can really only be answered in an individuals mind just and the same for God and Santa. Science is never going to step in and find proof that Santa doesn't exists because that is impossible to do. Science has a possibility of proving that God does or doesn't exist but that really isn't what they are set out to do. They focus more on physical things than ideas therefore I have little doubt that they will focus on DNA over the human mind but I don't think that they will still deny that modifying the human mind is just like changing what the being is.",

You are correct that there are several qualities that make up human life. I'm glad we have this established. Now lets review the ones you stated so far. Human life requires being alive, having human DNA, and being independent. This is your definition of human life.\n \n I don't want to try and make this sound confrontational although I have to make this point. Can you prove scientifically that these three things and only these three things are required for human life based on what science shows? The answer to this will probably be that there is evidence that supports this and there are those that will agree with you but not everyone. Some scientists will probably debate that human life only requires human DNA and the potential for it to become a human. There list of what qualities are needed for human life will be very different from your list. This example here is precisely why we cannot debate what science believes is correct because that is all sciences has when it comes to defining human life, a belief. You can have several scientists debate what this is all day long and never get anywhere because it is based on beliefs and opinions.\n \n OK, now refocusing on our personal opinions on what is human life. I actually disagree that we need to \"metabolise, reproduce, grow, and stimulate\". If you are unable to do one of these things such as reproduce I don't think this prevents you from being human life. Having human DNA is required for human life even from my point of view. I tend to believe a computer can be human life but I think I can only use that belief loosely. Human life does require a human body and not a mechanical one. As for being independent, I'm not sure what you mean here. If you mean that each person has to be different then how do you define identical twins? They are different in ways but so are clones and you probably don't believe they would be human do you?\n \n So you don't believe that the mind is even required for human life. So lets say that a human is born brain dead. Are they still human life since they will be kept alive by machines and therefore will not be able to reproduce or live like other people do? Would a human created with an apes mind be human life?\n \n Do you believe that humans made with some mechanical parts grafted onto them in order to give them more strength and speed and intelligence will still be human since they will be alive, individuals, and have human DNA?

You can have several scientists debate what this is all day long and never get anywhere because it is based on beliefs and opinions.\n\n \n I've never heard of a scientist who believes that solely by DNA the fetus is human. Why? Because such scientists don't exist- they aren't that stupid. That is certainly a very good reason and one of the reasons, but there are other ways to debate the issue as well. The definition of life is in your biology book metabolism, reproduction, growth, and stimuli. Humans have human DNA, which makes them automatically humans. This is how scientists classify species. They get the DNA. If you get a horse DNA and clone it, you will get a horse. IF you get Cat DNA and clone it, you will get a Cat. If you get human DNA, you will get a human. The fetus has human DNA, which makes it human. \n \n \n Can you prove scientifically that these three things and only these three things are required for human life based on what science shows?\n\n \n Can you prove me that your evidential support is the sole definition of life? No! We define human life biologically. This has been the way for centuries. The human life is a Homo sapiens\n \n Definition of human by the Webster-Merriam Dictionary:\n \n  Main Entry: 2human\n Function: noun\n Date: circa 1533\n : a bipedal primate mammal (Homo sapiens) : MAN; broadly : any living or extinct member of the family (Hominidae) to which the primate belongs \n \n Hence, human sentience has nothing to do with the matter.\n \n \n OK, now refocusing on our personal opinions on what is human life. I actually disagree that we need to \"metabolise, reproduce, grow, and stimulate\". If you are unable to do one of these things such as reproduce I don't think this prevents you from being human life. Having human DNA is required for human life even from my point of view. I tend to believe a computer can be human life but I think I can only use that belief loosely. Human life does require a human body and not a mechanical one.

They are different in ways but so are clones and you probably don't believe they would be human do you?\n\n \n You're debating against fact, again. All beings have at least the capability to reproduce. Whether you personally reproduce or not is not an issue. \n \n About independent- the point isn't that they are independent from eachother, the point is that the fetus is independent from the mother, hence, isn't part of the mother's body.\n \n \n So you don't believe that the mind is even required for human life. So lets say that a human is born brain dead. Are they still human life since they will be kept alive by machines and therefore will not be able to reproduce or live like other people do? Would a human created with an apes mind be human life?\n\n \n Yes they are human! Would I allow the death of the infant? That all depends. If there was an assurance that the infant will be able to live without the machines and hence not be braindead, sure, I'll allow it to live. If, however, the infant is only living because of the machines and there is no chance of recovery, then I would allow the infant to die. As for your ape situation, that is irrelivent, as it does not happen. The fetus will create a human brain, it isn't going to have an ape brain. You are, once again, moving from the issue. Would the ape be human? Yes, because it has human DNA. \n \n \n Do you believe that humans made with some mechanical parts grafted onto them in order to give them more strength and speed and intelligence will still be human since they will be alive, individuals, and have human DNA? How far will these alterations be able to go before you will say that they are going outside of the realm of human life?\n\n \n Yes, they're human too, because their brain has human DNA. I think you misunderstand me. I do believe the human mind is necessary, but in a different manner. If the human is capable of creating a mind, then they are human. If, however, they are not, then they aren't human. Obviously, all humans have human minds. \n \n \n But the fetus is unable to metabolize and reproduce. Even by your definition there will be a time where the fetus is not going to have all the traits of human life. Do you agree with this or is there something that I am missing?\n\n \n The fetus metabolizes- it takes nutrients from the mother. That's metabolism. The fetus reproduces- how else does it split cells? If you're thinking that they mean reproduction as in sexual reproduction, that's one, but not the only. Infants can't reproduce, but they are human, aren't they?",

Now that a human has been defined, we also understand that the fetus is alive, am I correct? \n \n \n\n It is relevant as it will give me a better idea of your opinion.

I'de have to really think about it. \n \n \n\n So if they don't have a mind then they are not human life? Wow, we might actually agree on the issue finally.\n\n \n No, I never said that, but I think I'm beginning to understnad your point. However wrong it is, I understand it. Allow me to explain; when the zygote is concieved, his personality, his brainstructure, everything about him is already preconcieved. What's left is to grow. Hence, the fetus is building up this system. Since the fetus has the capacity to have a human mind, it is a human life. I suppose one could say that if it doesn't create the mind it isn't considered a human, but this does not happen. If a human looses his mind (literally), and there is no chance of recovery, the person is still human, but we can allow the human to die, but not kill it. \n \n \n\n You said that reproduction proves human life. You are only proving the life of the cells here.\n\n \n That is, nonetheless, reproduction. If you don't consider the fetus a human because he doesn't sexually reproduce, than an infant isn't human either, as they don't sexually reproduce either. THe point is their cells reproduce (as our cells are at this current time), and the fetus has the ability to sexually reproduce in the future, as does the infant.",

   "Then you now understand that it is truly a human life?\n\n \n The fetus is human. The fetus is life. Does this make it human life? Not in my opinion it doesn't. The problem is that being a human requires that only a few things be scientifically true. Being life only requires a small list of things as well. These things probably include only DNA, form, and basic human necessities. So basically a brain dead person kept alive by machines can be considered a human and life. It wouldn't even matter if they ever woke up again, they would still be human and life. Human life is a much longer and more specific list of requirements. It focuses on what makes us human beyond just science and goes into the intangibles.\n \n So do I believe right now that a fetus is human life? Only at a certain stage. Until it has the ability to think it does not meet the requirements of human life.\n \n \nWell, after pondering on it, I've come to my conclusion. Would the Gorilla with a human brain be a human? No. He'll be a gorilla.\n\n \n Scientifically I also believe it would be a gorilla.\n \n \nBut this gorilla will be a human person, meaning, the gorilla will have a human personality, a human mind.\n\n \n I find this to be absolutely true.

Instead of having several children and the most healthy survive, we have a system over most of the world where only a few are born and then we are often kept alive artificially with medicine. So now we have an aging population since a typical family has two adults and two children instead of two adults and 10 children, as well as the two children may well be carrying genes that will produce more unhealthy offspring.

   "I was referring to the prior to 1930 statement. I thought the Catholic Chruch reasoning was the replenish the earth verse in the Bible but now that I think about it I'm not sure about that either.\n\n \n Actually, the foundation does go all the way back to Old Testament times. God told us to be fruitful and multiply. The worst curse for a woman was infertility because children were seen as a blessing from God. You know the verses about God forming persons in the womb (Jeremiah 1) and sons are a heritage of the lord..like arrows...happy is he who has a quiver, etc. (Psalm 127) Personhood was spoken of as being from the womb. There is also a verse from Genesis 38  describing the sin of Onan which was believed to be a contraceptive act. So I guess there might be 2 components of the foundation of the teaching: 1. children are a blessing 2.personhood begins in the womb.\n \n There is also New Testament support for a stance against contraception. The Church has developed other aspects of this teaching to include the idea of the unitive and procreative aspects of marriage being indispensible. One must occur with the other. I will not go further now though due to the length of the post that would be required and straying a bit off the original topic.",
