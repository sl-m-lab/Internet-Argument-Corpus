The benefit couldn't possibly be that they are trying \"save\" gay people because everyone knows that the kinds of things they do to gay people isn't going to change them.\n\n \n Approaching your question on a slightly different angle, the attempts to \"save\" gay people often completely ignore the RELIGION of the person they are attempting to save.\n If they worked solely within their own religion to try and ensure gay Christians were not gay, that would be one thing. But the focus extends much farther than that.\n \n The push is often for gays to not be \"gay\" (or engage in gay sexual behavior, as some would state), but it's a push that often doesn't care about the religion of the target.\n \n To put it bluntly, according to Christian dogma, a gay atheist who is no longer \"gay\" will still go to hell for being an atheist.\n \n It baffles me that Christianity has evolved to realize that they should coexist with the sin of worshipping other Gods, but hasn't evolved enough to realize that they should just coexist with the \"sin\" of homosexuality.\n \n I don't understand why they focus so much more on \"homosexuality\" than they do on atheism or Judaism or Hinduism or...",

Would this be their ticket to hell or would it fall under the \"love thy neighbor catagory\"?\n\n \n I think it's pretty clear that that might be the motivation of some folks in some congregations, especially if they are taught that that should be their response to us. Further up the hierarchy, however, it's obvious that the fight against gay rights has much more to do with legitimizing the religion in general and maintaining, or growing, its influence on a much wider variety of subjects. \n \n The current stance of some of the larger churches has gotten bizarrely focused on us. Opposing us has become their line in the sand in a struggle against their own growing irrelevance. It's a good choice in the sense that it's easy to oppose us and have a lot of people go along. It can also be presented as a much less complicated question than most other \"moral\" issues facing society right now. On the other hand, by investing so much moral currency in what is a fundamentally immoral fight against a small minority, they risk losing more than they can imagine. \n \n In the U.S. today, one should also keep in mind that opposing us can raise a heck of a lot of money and, sadly, the support of the Republican Party.

There's no need to engage in symantic backpedalling now--you're views are obvious on this. \n\n Jyoshu, PULL YOUR HEAD OUT.\n You are misrepresenting my statements.\n There is no \"back-pedalling\" when you're failing to understand what I'm saying quite clearly.\n \n QUOTE ME as to where I am saying what you claim...\n \n \n \nWell, I guess if only one single person of them was like that, it would be be significant to you, now wouldn't it? Or would it?\n\n No. It wouldn't.\n If it were ONLY Fred Phelps and his crew that travel with him, I wouldn't be talking about this with regards to Christians.\n \n You hyperbolize my stance grossly, which is again demonstrating your gross dishonesty.\n \n \n \nI ALREADY TOLD YOU, they try to put their beliefs into law on MANY issues. Anti-liquor measures, anti-gambling measures, anti-lottery, to name just a few. Oh, I forgot, you seem to think the only thing that their measures against homosexuality should be compared to is their efforts against other religions.\n\n Again, I didn't say that.\n But please. Continue with your blatant dishonesty and blatant lying...\n \n I acknowledge that Christians put out other forms of legislation. I never denied that.\n The point is that those other three legislation examples you just gave have NON-RELIGIOUS justification issues as well.\n \n \n \nGuess when you make a insignificant comparison to begin with, it takes less significant effort to prove and defend it, huh?\n\n Jyoshu, you're demonstrating over and over again why you are so easily disregarded.\n Quit with your straw-man argument tactics and argue my ACTUAL point instead of misrepresenting it...\n \n \n \nTry a more apt comparison next time and it'll be taken more seriously.\n\n Jyoshu, YOU don't take it seriously. I get that.\n I figured you would NEVER be able to take my point seriously. It's just not in you.\n \n Others get my point, and they are who I was posting for...",

I didn't \"define\" it because I knew neither of us would agree on it, and I saw no reason to go into that argument.\n I could easily turn around and ask if you see it as \"insignificant\", and then insist that you give your definition...\n But that gains us nothing...\n \n When preachers start preaching against homosexuality, and anti-gay legislation starts popping up on ballots, THAT is what I consider to be \"significant\".\n Happy now?\n \n \n \nAnd my question is, why did you choose ONLY the issue of other religions to compare it to, when there are other examples that Christians DO oppose as readily as homosexuality?\n\n Already explained Jyoshu. Go back and read my statements...\n 1) There has been a long history of religious battles whereby they fight for supremacy and impose upon each other's religious views. We have gotten to a significantly better place since then, allowing people to have their own religious views without a need to oppress others.\n The first reason for comparison is the HISTORY involved...\n \n 2a) How important the first commandment is to the Christian religion. If a person violates the first commandment and doesn't believe in the Christian God when he dies, there is no hope of them getting into heaven. If a person violates any other commandment or law, that person can still get into heaven.\n \n 2b) The lack of \"logic\" behind the whole situation for the Christians who discriminate against gays. A person can be of an ENTIRELY DIFFERENT religion, and they are fine with that. But they aren't fine with the idea of one of the arbitrary rules of that religion being broken?\n What does it gain them to have people no longer be gay if they are still not Christian?\n \n 3) Part 2 is based on my own personal observation of valuing different Christian rules. I have seen other Christians put forward that all the rules are \"equal\". And thus I question why if they are all \"equal\", why some are treated as more important than others, like in picking some to be put forth in legislated law...\n \n \n \nI find it interesting that you've taken ONE area of tolerance that Christians sometimes exhibit, and instead of having the honesty to commend them for it, you're trying to use it against Christians by comparing ONLY it to your pet issue. Particularly when they are other issues that would compare better to your pet issue in other ways.\n\n 1) I didn't realize you needed me to explicitly state it. I thought my language was clear in the way I was talking about it. I do think it's a good thing that we, as a society, and Christians, as a part of that society, have evolved into the idea of religious tolerance. I pat everybody who has made that leap of evolutionary tolerance on the back...\n Happier now?\n \n 2) I already explained why. I just re-explained why in this post.\n \n 3) Other issues have significantly SECULAR reasons for opposition, and not just biblical reasoning.\n And moreover, can you show me the biblical passages against gambling and the lottery?\n \n 4) I have no doubt that some Christians have other religious issues they insist upon imposing their religion upon others.\n I don't know about you, but I actually see that as a WORSE reality for the Christian.\n Kind of like which would be worse...\n A) Imposing one arbitrary religious ideal upon your non-Christian neighbors.\n B) Imposing dozens of arbitrary religious ideals upon your non-Christian neighbors.\n \n I see B as worse...\n \n \n \nAnd this doesn't even cover the fact that this whole thing of yours is a blanket generalization to begin with. Even with your obfuscated statement \"significant portion\" clarification of which you have yet to quantify. Why don't you just be honest here and admit you just wanted to take a swipe at Christians with this generalizing silly comparison?\n\n Why don't you just be honest and admit that you don't know my mind. You don't know my opinions. And you have no rational basis for your conclusion...\n \n I see Christianity as an incredibly hard life-style choice, and I respect anybody who actually tries to take that religion and honor it within their own life. I find some of the rules as pointless, but not harming others. A lot of the pointless rules and standards have already been abandoned from the Christian bible to modern Christian observance.\n Other rules as incredibly \"good\" to an extreme that I see no point living up to, but a \"good\" that could be a vicarious improvement to others if the Christian lived up to them....\n (Like always \"turning the other cheek\" and \"Forgiving 70*7\" advocate standards of \"good\" that would be irrationally \"good\" to secular standards.)\n \n I have little to no respect for those \"Christians\" who take religion as a weapon to be used against others, often ignoring the passages of what it says about their conduct and demanding that others adhere to their rules. For those \"Christians\" who use religion as a political tool.\n \n I have tried to be very specific as to not \"generalize\" (as you put it). When it is pointed out to me, I correct it. But now, you're not really \"pointing\" out anything to me. You disagree with my personal conclusion of \"significant\", and you are desparately trying to argue against it with an irrational need.\n \n Your whining is becoming rather inane. You are again hyperbolizing my opinion into things which it is not. And it's rather boring...\n \n But keep trying to turn your ant-hill into a mountain, if it pleases you. I will just keep correcting it...\n ======================================================\n \n On another note, I think that Matthew has adopted an acronym to describe the specific Christian people he is talking about. I believe it is \"CITHGAP\" or something similar?\n Should I adopt my own acronym to describe the specific Christian people I am talking about, so you won't have these inaccurate perceptions of \"generalizing\" that you keep whining about? Would that help?\n Or do you prefer to whine about \"generalizing\" that I'm not really doing?",

I'm not interested in dueling generalities here--if you want to talk specifics, then do so, otherwise you're wasting time.

It could be run as \"resisting arrest\". Perhaps it did involve resisting arrest...\n But you can bet dollars to donuts that the black community in Harlem will be noticing it and talking about it a LOT MORE than the white community in New York City...\n \n \n \nI think the real reason is that you can't quantify it in terms of numbers, and therefore the assertion is meaningless.\n\n Like I pointed out, YOU can't quantify the number either, and thus if you thought it was \"insignificant\", you would be unable to prove it by similar difficulty.\n \n But again, I already gave my standards. You can whine like crazy because I don't care to debate it, but that's quite frankly your problem...\n \n \n \nFine, I'll let you change the subject from a \"significant portion\" (a reference to quantity) to 'significant' in terms of what some have done. You went from a quantitative claim to a qualitative claim, because the qualitative claim was easier to defend.\n\n I said \"significant portion\". That doesn't automatically mean \"quantitative\" or \"qualitative\". It means \"significant\", which could mean quantitative OR qualitative.\n \n YOUR INTERPRETATION was initially \"quantitative\", but you don't seem to realize that I haven't changed anything in my statement of things. It's how YOU ARE LOOKING at it that is different.\n \n And from another angle, if I WAS claiming \"quantitative\" significance all along, I wouldn't have told you that discussion on the issue was pointless...\n The fact that my view-point WAS ALWAYS qualitative was part of the reason I thought discussion on it was pointless.\n \n \n \nYes, I'll agree there is significance in anti-gay legislation and ballots. As I've already stated, I don't think too highly of Christian attempts to legislate things like this either.\n\n Understood.",

Whether it's warranted discrimination is a legal issue that has to be debated on legal grounds. But even if it's not warranted, it doesn't mean that these Christians can't participate in the democratic process through ballots and voting for candidates who hold to their views. That's the way the American system works; deal with it.\n \n \nDo you see anybody arguing here that homosexuality is the ONLY issue they do that with?\n\n \n Yeah . . . you.

Its because they believe homosexuality has a more serious consequence on society, and\n \n b.) because opposing other religions via legislation isn't feasible in our freedom-of-religion society\n \n There is one other I haven't mentioned . . .\n \n c.) because they feel they need to react against homoseuxality and it's effects on society. In their view it's a defensive measure.\n \n Those are the reasons. You can change the subject all you want, but you've been told now WHY there appears to be a double standard. And again, because Christians deal with MANY issues they attempt to affect legislation over, homosexuality is by no means any pet issue for them. You've been shown this now, and whether or not you choose to accept it is up to you. I'm beginning to agree with JPSarte that there's little point in arguing with a brick wall here, so accept it or accept that we disagree and move on.\n \n \n And on a totally different matter . . .

A point I've never abandoned or backed down from.\n But evidently, it would help \"some\" people if I repeated every position I have in every post so they don't get lost...\n :xbanghead \n \n \n \nThe argument whether or not discrimination against gay people is good or not (which, of course, is the first you've brought that up in this exchange) is a seperate debate than what we're having regarding why Christians don't legislate against other religions but do against gay marriage.\n\n Okay. \"Separate debate\".\n Are you capable of handling two debates at the same time?\n If not, then just ignore my point (like you have so many others) and concentrate only on what you can handle...\n \n \n \nThe argument whether or not discrimination against gay people is good or not (which, of course, is the first you've brought that up in this exchangeWhether it's warranted discrimination is a legal issue that has to be debated on legal grounds. But even if it's not warranted, it doesn't mean that these Christians can't participate in the democratic process through ballots and voting for candidates who hold to their views.\n\n <scratches head<\n Have I ever said \"Christians can't participate in the democratic process through ballots and voting for candidates who hold to their views\"???\n \n Once again, you have succeeded on a) misunderstanding your opponent's stance, and/or b) stating a position that nobody is against.\n \n Do you realize how often you do that?\n \n \n \nThis is a whole different debate. I don't mind debating it with you, but you're changing the subject.\n\n No. I'm not \"changing\" the subject.\n I'm still ready to debate BOTH subjects.\n So go back and address my arguments on the \"why do Christians focus inordinately on gay issues while ignoring other significant 'religious' issues like religious deities\" issue...\n \n \n \nThe bottom line of your beef with some Christians NOT legislating against other religions but trying to change law to affect gay behavior is because of what I've told you already . . . .\n a.) Its because they believe homosexuality has a more serious consequence on society, and\n\n As I have REPEATEDLY quoted, the whole \"serious consequence on society\" XXXX is a load of crappy XXXX. I've refuted it with the statements of the experts on culture and society. EVERYBODY on the anti-gay side of the fence seems to ignore that, but they keep in with the claims.\n \n So now I leave it to you, Jyoshu, since you seem to believe there are points of the anti-gay side that I don't get.\n Can you explain to me WHAT SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES on society they believe will happen?\n And specifically WHY they believe that?\n \n \n \nb.) because opposing other religions via legislation isn't feasible in our freedom-of-religion society\n\n But now here's the kicker Jyoshu.\n Can you explain WHY our society, and Christians in general, are for freedom of religion...\n ... as opposed to WHY some Christians are in favor of limiting equality for gays???\n I'm not talking about blindly pointing to the first amendment, but explaining WHY the first amendment is there, and why we SUPPORT it being there, as opposed to Christian opposition to similar legislation for sexual orientation...\n \n Can you do that Jyoshu? And \"explain\" to me the whole \"Christian anti-gay belief\" thing which you say I don't fully get?\n \n And in addition, your point in b) is mooted by the fact that SCOTUS has set forth a standard for gays on this as well...\n Legislating against homosexuality has been shown as EXPLICITLY against our constitution via Lawrence v Texas. Quotes which I have again shown repeatedly, but nobody on the anti-gay side has really addressed them...\n \n \n \nThere is one other I haven't mentioned . . .\n\n Oh dear.\n Is this the \"changing the subject\" thing you keep complaining about in action?\n \n \n \nc.) because they feel they need to react against homoseuxality and it's effects on society. In their view it's a defensive measure.\n\n Actually, Jyoshu, you DID just mention it.\n This is a repeat of point a), and as such, my questions on point a apply here as well.\n \n What \"effects on society\" are they supposedly \"defending\" against???\n \n \n \nThose are the reasons. You can change the subject all you want, but you've been told now WHY there appears to be a double standard.\n\n Not changing the subject at all.\n ADDING to the subject with additional points...\n (Points that I have made before, I must point out...)\n \n \n \nAnd again, because Christians deal with MANY issues they attempt to affect legislation over, homosexuality is by no means any pet issue for them.\n\n Yes. It is for a LOT of them...\n Not saying that it isn't one of many issues they deal with, but one of the issues that they FOCUS MORE ATTENTION on than others.\n \n \n \nYou've been shown this now, and whether or not you choose to accept it is up to you.\n\n Oh :xcensored Jyoshu. Pure and utter b.s.\n You have shown me that YOU BELIEVE that, but you have NOT PROVEN that at all.\n \n In fact, I even CHALLENGED you to go tit for tat on which they concentrate on more by LOOKING AT EXAMPLES of what they focus on. I'll give an example of Christians seeking to discriminate against gays. You give an example of Christians seeking to discriminate against another religious issue...\n \n You DROPPED THE CHALLENGE!\n So don't tell me I've been \"shown\" something that I never have, when you have EVEN REFUSED TO MEET A CHALLENGE on that issue.\n \n \n \nI'm beginning to agree with JPSarte that there's little point in arguing with a brick wall here, so accept it or accept that we disagree and move on.\n\n Seriously Jyoshu.\n As I pointed out to you before, I will still point out your dishonesty and inaccuracies regardless of whether or not you \"reply\" to me or not...\n My mind is just as \"open\" as yours. I am willing to lay out my arguments and leave them up for scrutiny.\n JPSartre wasn't as willing, putting more stringent demands on the position of others than on his own.\n Anybody who tells people that THEY have to prove THEIR position, otherwise JPSartre's position is to be ASSUMED is obviously not objective or even-handed in the approach.\n \n And if you want to continue the discussion whereby you continue with JPSartre's position and defend it, we can see where the \"brick wall\" truly lay.\n \n But again, that's another challenge that you're going to drop, just like you avoid my questions, and then insist that you have \"shown\" me things you never have.\n \n \n \nAnd on a totally different matter . . . I see BobNelson2 is still up to his dishonest and disingenuous ways.\n\n Jyoshu, you have NO room to throw stones on the issue of honesty...\n And I would ask you for an example of BobNelson's dishonesty, but we've been down that road with similar challenges, and your claims came up empty...",

   "Beginning in 1997, Louisiana, Arizona and Arkansas enacted laws making covenant marriage an option for heterosexuals. Before marrying, you have to go through counseling. You have to affirm orally and in writing that your marriage is \"for life,\" that you accept its \"responsibilities,\" that you've \"chosen each other carefully,\" that you've \"disclosed to one another everything\" important, and that you'll \"take all reasonable efforts to preserve our marriage, including marital counseling.\" Divorce takes longer than today's no-fault dissolutions, and the grounds are narrower. The prescribed waiting period is usually two years.\n \n The pioneers of covenant marriage thought their followers would flock to it. They were wrong. In states conservative enough to promote it, fewer than one in 100 marrying couples have chosen this option -- about 6,000 to 7,000 couples, judging from published data. Meanwhile, in states liberal enough to permit same-sex marriage or civil unions, thousands of gay couples have signed up -- more than 7,300 in Massachusetts, 1,200 in Vermont (6,600 more if you count out-of-staters) and 700 in Connecticut. About 3,700 gay couples have registered for domestic partnerships in New Jersey, and 30,000 or so have registered in California. More blue-state gay couples than red-state straight couples are signing up for as much commitment as the law allows.\n \n So, on the right, empty pews in the church of commitment. On the left, people fighting to get in. It's a match made in heaven.

   "You do realize that freedom of religion was a novel idea not so long ago, don't you? And you do realize that the Protestant majority in this country passed quite a few anti-Catholic laws, I hope. Of course the Catholics joined them in passing even more anti-Jewish laws, but that's beside the point.\n \n Ooops. It's not beside the point at all!\n\n thats right. i dont think there is a single law in that exists that be considered anti- some group or the other. whether for religious influence or not, laws are passed based on majority voted, and based on the personal belief of the majority. at one time adultery was illegal and punishable by death. at another time there was nothing legally wrong with adultery. if adultery being wrong happens to coincide with a religious belief, then so be it. but dont blame religion for that, blame that on the personal belief of a large number of people that the laws affact, because thats how laws are made",

   "ummm... how do you come to this conclusion. churches preach that homosexuality is a sin. churches preach that islam is false. i dont get your point at all\n\n Let me be more specific.\n These churches \"preach\" within the confines of the church grounds on both issues... (Although I've never heard of a church pastor preaching within the church that Islam is false. We had that discussion earlier...)\n \n But when it comes to homosexuality, they go much further.\n \n Gay pride parades. EVERY single one I've been to has some church component with their booth (and sometimes megaphones) telling people that it's evil to be gay. I've never heard of anything similar for a mosque.\n \n Legislation. Churches have preached explicitly from the pulpit that members of that church were expected to vote a certain way. The Catholic church, for example, has threatened withholding sacrament from church members that didn't vote as the church dictated.\n Again, I have never heard of anything similar against Islam.\n \n The point isn't where their similarities can be found. The point is in the EXTRA MILE that some Christian organizations go to \"fight against\" homosexuality in ways that have no analogy for other religions.\n \n \n \nchurches show concern for worshipping other gods inside and outside their church. churches show concern about homosexuality inside and outside their church.\n\n I agree with the latter statement. I can give you multiple examples of that.\n I have never seen the former statement in action with regards to \"outside their church\". Can you point to an example of that?\n \n \n \n can you say that a sermon against homosexuality, preached by a pastor in a local church, is aimed towards gays outside of that church? how do you determine the audience?\n\n You're delving deeply into straw-man argument territory.\n When the pastors are OUTSIDE the church preaching to the general public, THAT is when they are \"aiming towards gays outside of the church\".\n \n I have never really seen an example of that with regards to other religions.\n \n \n \n the audience is in fact anybody that is within hearing range. a pastor preaches about homosexuality and it ends up on the news. \n\n Going back to your questions RIGHT above this, how many \"news\" cameras have you ever seen covering a pastor speaking within his church on Sunday?\n I'm speaking of examples of pastors OUTSIDE the church.\n \n \n \nthen gays all over say that that pastor is preaching against them. how do they come to this conclusion? if a pastor is preaching something to his church, regardless of what it is, if it is not directly aimed to gays outside of his church then why should gays be concerned about what he preaches to his congregation?\n\n To specify one last time within this post...\n I'm not talking about them speaking WITHIN their own church. I thought that my last post made that clear.\n \n I am talking about them going OUTSIDE their church to preach to people who ARE NOT MEMBERS of their church...",

   "this is exactly why, as i said before. the bible commands christians to not only personally avoid sin, but also to speak out against sin in others. the great commssion, which was the ultimate commandment jesus himself left with his disciples on the last day he was with them was this: \"go into all the world and preach the gospel to everyone, making disciples of all people\". a christians job is not just to secure salvation for himself, but even more importantly to \"win souls\". i.e., share the gospel of salvation and convert others to sinless redemption and christianity.\n \n living in sin is one's personal choice, as is using electricity and eating hotdogs. a christian wont force you or beg you to not live in sin if you dont want to. however, the christian, like the jews and amish, make a demand on those that want to be ACCEPTED AS ONE OF THEM to abide by the rules of their belief. this entails not being homosexual.\n \n you dont have to be a jew, amish or christian. you can survive well without being one of these groups. and if the stipulations are working out or isnt cost effective, then your responsibility to yourself is to either abide by the rules or not be accepted as one of them\n\n \n \n \n The Jews and the Amish have their rules and regulations for their own people. They do not go out recruiting or trying to save souls. Nor do Hindus or Buddists or Muslims. if Christians feel it is their duty and/or their job to share their beliefs, then by all means share them.

(And to the last question, I would say they should be able to behave irrationally... But the government should recognize the irrationality and not cater to it.)\n \n \n \nshould it be unconstitutional that murder be illegal, since laws against murder can be traced back to religious beliefs based on the bible? if a law in place coincides with a religious belief, does that make that law unconstitutional?\n\n Re-read my posts...\n I'm talking about laws that are ONLY based on religious beliefs.\n \n The law against murder is secular, based on common sense.\n \n \n \n[edit] and on your point about \"no other basis\", can you give me an example of a law that is based on a biblical belief and another basis?\n\n I think one topical example is laws discriminating against homosexuals...\n Can you give me a secular basis for these laws?",

Why? Because you can't find something in the constitution that makes this claim. You try seperation of church and state yet you can't seem to back that up.\n \n \nThe Lawrence decision rejected a morality-based rationale as a legitimate State interest. The Court recognized that many people condemn homosexuality as immoral:\n The Lawrence decision did a lot of things...none of which was grounded in our constitution. The current court seems to think the elected body shouldn't deal with morality but rather the courts should...I oppose this position. Getting into why the Lawerence decision was totally wrong is a seperate discussion but I wouldn't mind getting into why \"substantive due process\" is wrong and why evolving constitutions are wrong.\n \n \nYou know, I have to laugh out loud whenever I see somebody claim this.\n Show me ANYWHERE in your religion where it tells you that you must \"create laws\" in the GOVERNMENT to prevent OTHER NON-CHRISTIANS from not following your laws.\n \n Preventing you from creating religious laws into governmental laws IS NOT a restriction upon your \"free exercise\" of religion.\n It's patently absurd for you to claim that.\n \n NOWHERE in your religion does it say that you should do that. It's NOT a part of your \"exercise\" of religion.\n Seems like a bold claim from someone that doesn't know what my religion is. \n \n Lets just say for the sake of arguement that my religion does say it. What is your claim then?\n \n \nYou're not getting the picture Steeeeve...\n You're blindly assuming that there isn't an obvious middle ground.\n WHOSE religion is violated if there is NO law on widgets?\n \n The one group can use them as their religion requires.\n The other group can not use them as their religion requires.\n WHOSE religion is \"violated\" then???\n \n THINK about it...\n\n The ones that have a religion that says widgets most be outlawed...\n \n \nWhat's the problem if the government ALLOWS the use of widgets, but not forbidding or mandating their use?\n It amazes me how often some Christians have their mindset stuck in a desire to enforce their religious laws upon others.\n Who said I was Christian? Moreover, who said I can't vote for a law because of my morality? \n \n \nYou are seriously not keeping up with the news if you think so.\n The internet and proprietary claims on \"copyrights\" are a perfect example of how the technology is evolving faster than the laws are being written.\n Good thing copyright is covered under common law :). Perhaps you didn't realize that we have common law which is different from statutory law. \n \n As for your internet \"claims\"...we don't need a constitutional amendment process for this. Common law court rulings seem to be fine. Moreover, it seems like congress has come up with plenty of internet related laws regarding copyright infringement.\n \n \nNo. That's not what the legislator \"believes\".\n In a lot of these quickly evolving areas, they ARE TRYING to match the evolving society and capabilities with new laws.\n I have seen a LOT of these examples be outdated and inadequate when the law finally comes into effect.\n \n Your claims as to what the legislator \"believes\" is pure b.s. on your part.\n Unless you're ready to back up your claim...\n Trying to match the evolving society? What does this have to do with living constitutionalist? Rulings on abortion and other \"moral\" issues are the things I have a problem with...these aren't recent evolving society problems. \n \n As for backing up my claim....that is an irrelevant part of my point so if you don't believe than don't.\n \n \nIt's not.\n If the legislator actually MADE the amendments and the laws for the situations, they would be enforced.\n When there is an ABSENCE on the situation, the courts have to interpret the constitution as best they can.\n \n Our country isn't \"ruled\" by 9 unelected people at all.\n People who make statements like that only demonstrate their ignorance of the system.\n The legislatores do make laws for these situations oddly enough. There were laws against abortion and homosexual conduct to name a few....the court decided these were bad laws so they became unconstitutional based on the \"its a bad law\" amendment of the constitution. The courts are \"interpreting\" a constitution on the basis of their own personal beliefs...if they weren't then I would like for you to tell me what their basis for judgement is.\n \n Insulting me is not going to make you right...so just cut the XXXX.\n \n \nAgain, you demonstrate ignorance...\n Do you truly think there is no \"basis\" for establishing what rights exist in this country? Is that what you think?\n I seriously want to see you answer that question before I proceed further with schooling you.\n Alright, it is clear you are just going to act like a child from here on out....reporting to admin and I am done with this conversation.",

Why do we say that a wife cannot be compelled to testify against the husband, and vice versa? Why do we say that insurance, medical, legal, etc. benefits must be afforded to married couples?\n \n I think I've asked more questions than I've answered here, but hopefully I've made a point that if you're looking for a \"rational reason\", you should realize that it's much more complicated than that...\n\n remember, the question isnt \"why do people get married,\" its \"why does marriage exist in the first place\". youre actually not answering the question. legal rights and benefits came after marriage existed. these are effects of marriage, not the reason why marriage exists in the first place. as for couples coming together because of a child, a parental arrangement, or even good ol' falling in love, these couples get married because the idea of marriage already exists.\n \n the question requires a looking back to the original \"invention\" of marriage. why did marriage come into being? what could have caused people to think that marriage would be a good idea when it was first thought up?\n \nI think the reason I gave you is pretty rational. Mankind is a social animal. Living in a social group requires some way of understanding how members of the group are to interact with each other.\n \n If that's not it, why don't you tell us your \"rational\" reason????\n\n i addressed your answer by talking about 3 types of social animals: lions, wildebeasts and social insects (like bees). of these lions are probably the closest resemblance to humans in social structure. they form prides, lead by one male and several females and offspring. they have established territories and live and hunt together as a family. the females are loyal to the male leader as long as no other male rival defeats the leader and overthrows the pride, taking the female as his own. so even in this instance, the females dont really have a lifelong commitment to the male. and the relationship isnt even monogamous\n \n there are some animals that pair off and remain monogamous and commited for life. grey parrots are an example i can think of. but they are not social animals, they live alone most of their youth, and hardly interact with other parrots.\n \n coming to think of it, the animals that are more social are usually less mongamous, and the ones that make pairs for life are usually the solatary ones. so man being a social animal really doesnt explain why marriage among humans exists\n \nAs suggested, you are trying to go somewhere with this, but I'll bite.\n \n My understanding is that the universal and unique attribute of marriage is the creation of legal ties with other families. This means that you and are now related \"by marriage\" (affinity) rather than \"by blood\" (consanguinity.) This seems rational to me.\n\n good answer. this would mean that somewhere along the line, people thought that it would be a good idea for families to be bound to other families. in many cases, a treaty or diplomatic agreement would be sealed by one party offering his daughter's hand in marriage to the other, making the deal more tightly bound and significant. however, this can be considered a way to use marriage as a tool, rather than a reason for marriage to exist in the first place. tying 2 families together through marriage and making of in-laws is really a side-effect of marraige, but i dont know if you can consider it a reason why marriage exists in the first place",

Did you really not know?\n \n \n christians do not indignify or disrespect gays. christians point out that homosexuality is a sin. thats not disrespect, and its not treating gays less than human\n \n \n \n When it is taken out of a church and brought into the public arena it is not only disrespectful, it is tactless, and RUDE! Are you aware that freedom of religion also means freedom FROM religion? Do you find Jews pointing out the fact that Christianity is sheer blasphemy from their point of view? Do you find them trying to limit your rights because you are Christians? Which I might add was a choice on your part, you were not born that way. Which is neither here nor there, be a Christian, and remember there are plenty of others tolerating you. You should employ the same courtesy in tolerance of others. Whatever intolerance you do encounter is defensive in response to an offensive attack.\n \n \n \n there are lots of legislation that coincide with and originated from christian doctrine. and there are lots of legislation that has been derived fropm elsewhere. i dont know how many times i need to repeat myself, but laws are not passed based on its religious origin, but based on the personal beliefs of the PEOPLE within the constituency that the law governs. those beliefs, regardless of where they originate, is what can affect what legislature is put in place. you cannot tell people that their beliefs are valid in cases that suit you, and not valid in cases that dont suit you.\n \n \n \n What are you talking about. Laws based solely upon religious belief are unconstitutional. It does not matter if 110% of the population agree upon it. It will not fly unless an amendment to the constitution changes the constitutionality of said law.\n \n \n \n \n if a large group of people in america have a strong personal belief about something that originated in a religious source, that belief is legally valid because a large group of people in america share it. if a large group of people in america have a strong personal belief about something that originated in a lie (as is the case with the pretext of this war in iraq), that belief is legally valid because a large group of people in america share it. come to face with this reality, then youll be able to deal with the situation of gay rights from a realistic viewpoint\n\n \n \n \n How did the various acts of racial equality pass into law in the 1960's? The majority of white America did not want any racial equality legislation passed. The most adament resistence came fron the South and the Bible Belt. Please don't preach about Christianity as if it has any room to judge morality. Can you say American Indians? Remember those savage pagans? They welcomed the Pilgrims from the Mayflower. The Pilgrims had fled England to escape religious persecution from other Christians. Over the course of the next 200 years they were killed and/or exiled to reservations in their own land. Meanwhile slavery was a booming industry and that was the land of our founding fathers. A land where Christian values and principles flourished, like the revenue from cotton and tobacco. Do unto others, except if your an Indian or a plantation slave. This went off topic, but for the purpose of asking: Where does Christianity with its blood stained hands, and its lusty love of money, power and land come to point out the sin of homosexuality. Or any other sin for that matter? While protesting gay rights I have never heard an acknowledgement and/or an apology to the American Indian or the Black people for Christian expansion and dominance. When I made the reference to Christians being fed to the lions and not learning from the experience, I was refering to the continued blatant disregard of those whom you choose to persecute. It does not matter what your scripture says about sin beyond the walls of your churches. What Christianity needs to learn is how NOT to treat others. How to leave others alone. And in regards to legislation, the minority is protected from the tyranny of the majority. A very important aspect of the constitution. If Christian numbers ever drop to minority percentages you'll be protected against people who use their relgion to point out the sin of Christianity. Thats not disrespect, and its not treating Christians less than human. It's just the mentality of one group who find itself superior to another.

   "Marriage began as a civil institution. Christianity didn't co-opt it until centuries after Christ: \nIndeed, in the earliest days of the church, Christians had a jaundiced view of heterosexual marriage, and saw celibacy as the prime Christian vocation. Jesus had urged his followers to leave their wives and children (Luke 14:25-26). St Paul, the earliest Christian writer, believed that because Jesus was about to return and inaugurate the Kingdom of God, where there would be no marriage or giving in marriage, it was simply not worth saddling yourself with a wife or husband. This, Paul was careful to emphasise, was simply his own opinion, not a divine ruling. It was perfectly acceptable for Christians to marry if they wished, but in view of the imminent second coming, Paul personally recommended celibacy. \n \n The fathers of the church often used these New Testament remarks to revile marriage, with the same intensity as those Christians who condemn homosexual partnerships today. The fathers accepted - albeit grudgingly - that marriage was part of God's plan. St Augustine taught that originally in the Garden of Eden, married sex had been rational and good. But after the fall, sexuality became a sign of humanity's chronic sinfulness, a raging and ungovernable force, a mindless, bestial enjoyment of the creature that held us back from the contemplation of God. Augustine's doctrine of original sin fused sexuality and sin indissolubly in the imagination of the Christian west. \n \n For centuries this tainted the institution of matrimony. Augustine saw his conversion to Christianity as a vocation of celibacy. \"We ought not to condemn wedlock because of the evil of lust,\" he explained, \"but nor must we praise lust because of the good of wedlock.\" His teacher, St Ambrose of Milan, believed that \"virginity is the one thing that keeps us from the beasts\". The north African theologian Tertullian equated marriage with fornication. \"It is not disparaging wedlock to prefer virginity,\" wrote St Jerome. \"No one can compare two things if one is good and the other evil.\" When one of his women disciples contemplated a second marriage, Jerome turned on her in disgust: \"The dog has turned to his own vomit again and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.\" \n \n In England during the middle ages, couples were married in the church porch and not in the sanctuary - a practice that eloquently revealed the liminal status of matrimony in the Christian worldview: Chaucer's Wife of Bath married five husbands \"at the church door\". Even Luther, who left his monastery to marry, inherited Augustine's bleak view of sex. \"No matter what praise is given to marriage,\" he wrote, \"I will not concede that it is no sin.\" Matrimony was a \"hospital for sick people\". It merely covered the shameful act with a veneer of respectability, so that \"God winks at it\". \n http://www.guardian.co.uk/gayrights/story/0,12592,987873,00.html",

   "your argument is that society and the government should not limit the definition of marriage to the union of a man and a woman. your argument extends in that defining marriage as the union between only a man and woman is unconstitutional because that definition is derived from religiouis sources, and is kept that way for religious reasons. i think everybody here agrees that if a law is derived from a religious source, then it violates the constitutional amendment that demands separation of church and state.\n\n \n Well, I think it's unconstitutional for more reasons than that, but OK. By the way, I think you're waaaaay off base if you think everyone here agrees with that last bit. \n \n \ninterestingly enough, if marriage itself is derived from religious sources, then based on your own argument, wouldnt that make marriage itself unconstitutional? how can you argue for the right to participate in a practice originated in religion, yet argue that it is unconstitutional for the practice to be based on the religion it originated in?\n\n \n You say \"if\".

   "Let me try rephrasing.\n A legitimate state interest is required for legislation that discriminates against people's rights. If opponents of gay marriage had a legitimate state interest for restricting gay marriage, it would be a whole different ball-game.\n \n \"Morality\", as I have shown via Supreme Court cases, is an insufficient claim for a legitimate state interest. Almost ANYTHING can be said to be an issue of \"morality\". Anti-black and anti-Jewish groups often claim \"morality\" in their rationale.\n \n Moreover, religion is also an insufficient basis for a legitimate state interest. Religious morality would fall under the \"morality\" discussed above, and religion itself has 'separation of church and state' issues.\n \n If something has a \"religious\" claim for existence, BUT ALSO a non-religious legitimate state interest for existing, then the \"religious\" claim is essentially moot as the existence of the \"legitimate state interest\" is the winning factor. People could argue for laws against murder based on religion, and on secular state interests. The \"religious\" reasons would be moot, as it is the other secular state interests which would justify the murder laws.\n\n doesnt it follow, then, that the concept of heterosexual marriage, when it first emerged, had NO secular state interests that motivated the government to preserve it this long? obviously a family unit consisting of a married monogamous heterosexual pair would be beneficial to society for non-religious reasons, otherwise why would it not only be around, but also be granted with so many benefits? the fact that the government, for so many millennia, under both religious and secular rule, has gone to great lengths to make these benefits available to married couples testifies to this. therefore, there are obviously non-religious state interests in defining and maintaining marriage as is. that would mean that the case for keeping marriage as a heterosexual legal union is not solely based in religion, as you argue it is",

   "Homo sapiens has been pair-bonding since before they came down from the trees, just as other species have. They didn't need some priest to come along--should there have been such a thing at the time--and tell them, \"Hey, our sky pixie thinks it would be a good thing if everyone paired off.\" It happened instinctively.\n \n \"Marriage\" was invented to validate the pair-bonding for purely practical reasons. When you've got two people from different families coming together to form a non-blood-related third family, things like inheritance and property division have to be agreed upon. The civil concept of \"marriage\" was invented to handle such arrangements, to minimize future disputes and officially recognize the non-related couple as a legitimate entity of its own. \n \n Originally, this was probably no more than the tribal chieftain drawing a map on the ground to indicate who got what and waving his club over the couple's head... but whatever ceremony was involved, and whether or not he invoked the Great Goat Spirit as he officialized their union, the social construct known as \"marriage\" originated as a purely practical, civil institution long before any \"organized\" religion came along. \n \n When they did come along, each religion dealt with it in its own way, imposing its own rules (vide Leviticus, e.g.). Christianity in particular was very slow to get on board, with Paul and Augustine very leery of the idea, and even after Catholicism declared it a sacrament, protestant leaders like Calvin disagreed. Consequently, the Puritans who first colonized this country also rejected the idea of marriage as a religious institution (see citation in earlier post)... and to this day, it is first and foremost a civil construct here. \n \n You can get married without church recognition in the U.S., but you can't get married without government recognition.",
