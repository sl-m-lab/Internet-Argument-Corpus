   "It looks like things are cooling down now, but I'm still waiting to hear how such a serious problem could have occurred if something hadn't gone horribly wrong.\n\n \n What I heard was that 12 nuclear power plants in Canada quit working, which shut down most of the great lakes grid. The only areas on the grid that didn't lose power (such as most of Pennsylvania) did so because they quit sharing their power and distributed it only among themselves. But that's just what I heard...it may or may not be correct.\n \n \nCould a single terrorist attack actually cause a blackout like this for a prolonged period of time?\n\n \n One instance of terrorism on our power system probably couldn't. But a few simultaneous instances (like the hijackings on 9/11) probably could.\n \n \nCould a series of these attacks take down the entire US power grid? Are we really this vulnerable to such attacks as this blackout would seem to indicate?\n\n \n Although, I certainly wish this would not have happened, maybe it is better that it happen now when we can get power up quickly than through a terrorist attack where it could take weeks or months to rebuild infrastructure.",
