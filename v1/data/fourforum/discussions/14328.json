   "NY Times Advertisement\n \n \nBecause everyone wants to know how Mr. Greene, an unemployed Army veteran who had been completely unknown until Tuesday, inexplicably defeated a heavily favored former legislator and judge to become the state's Democratic nominee for the Senate - and the state's latest political circus act.\n \n Mr. Greene had just a few peaceful hours to savor his victory in the tiny, ramshackle home he shares with his elderly father along a quiet highway in Manning, where he has been bunkered since election night. Then, The Associated Press reported that Mr. Greene was arrested in November and is facing a felony obscenity charge; he is accused of showing pornography to a University of South Carolina student. He had been discharged \"involuntarily\" from the Army and showed no signs of having waged an actual campaign in recent months - no advertising, no staff, no money. \n \n \n So-----how did this guy win??? He was elected by Americans. As usual they had no idea who or what they were voting for. The most believable theory at this point is that the names on the ballot were alphabetical, and his came before the other guys.\n \n Pathetic",

The title of this thread should be, \"How did the average american democrat get to be so epically stupid\" since democrats will blindly vote for the parties candidate rather than the person based on actual qualifications. \n \n So don't blame our political system for this embarrassment of voter insight, blame the average intelligence quotient of the average progressive/liberal/democrat for blindly supporting a name on a ballot rather than an actually established candidate they knew to be qualified except that he was a known conservative. :xbanghead",

Oh wait, we've already been down that road, haven't we! Simply put, you're about as politically conservative as Marx was or as Obama is so I doubt that any position you take is well thought out or founded in reason. \n \n You dare to criticize Bush as if he was the worst President we ever had when compared to the misery index we have under Obama, Bush was a true breath of fresh air. This current president who promised total transparency has been the most deceptive and dishonest administration in our storied history as a nation.\n \n What is so pathetic about people like you is that you think by claiming to be a member of the right, and then criticizing/condemning its leaders, that somehow makes you deep and honestly objective. Well balderdash; it makes you a complete jerk and an uninformed blowhard since you haven't the insight to objectively see that the LEFT is the real problem for this country and if not for the legislation of the liberals/progressives when Bush was president, the banking and real estate collapse never would have happened. Let me remind you of some undeniable facts.\n \n Note the dates of these warnings from Republicans, and the denials by Barney Frank & co. that any problems existed: YouTube - Democrats were WARNED of Financial crisis and did NOTHING \n \n Here's more in their own words as they deny a problem even existed: YouTube - Shocking Video Unearthed Democrats in their own words Covering up the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac Scam that caused our Economic Crisis\n \n So go ahead and continue to blame Bush as you claim to be on the right side of the aisle, you just confirm for all the informed among us how easily manipulated and deceived you are since you are either as ignorant or disingenuous as the leftists you claim to oppose.

It has been this way for almost 250 years. In fact, at times, it has been worse. \n \n The best way to solve this inevitable dilemma is to simply limit what the government can do. This works perfectly in most states. In Virginia you get 60-90 days to pass stuff and you have to balance a budget. They still bicker but if they do it for too long they basically run into the time they'd normally be working a real job and thus are not getting paid their REAL paycheck.

   "I never said the majority of americans listen to talk radio, I did say that of those who listen to talk radio, the vast majority listen to conservative talk as compared to progressive talk whose hosts can't pay an audience to stick around long enough to hear one commercial.\n \n Its commercial radio after all, and if the liberals had an audience, it would also have commercial endorsements. And what is the liberal option to Rush and Glenn? Stuart and Colbert? You call them intellectually stimulating when their idea of delivering political news is to create perceived Irony and mockery of the conservative perspective? Our problems are real and very serious, so I don't see how an hour of jokes and mockery of the problems we have contribute anything real to an actual solution. Yet, those two shows feed most on the left their daily diet of what is seen as political news today. That this doesn't scare you to death speaks volumes about your political IQ which is that of a newborn from what I can observe.\n\n \n Nope. Didnt call Stuart or Colbert intellectually stimulating. That is you projecting because you have been dumbed down so much that you dont realize that there are not just 2 sides, and somebody who recognizes the absolute FACT that Rush and Beck are pretty much full of it, and they spew absolute garbage with no factual basis, does not automatically spend their time hanging on every word that Stuart or Colbert say. \n \n Believe it or not, it is possible to realize that Rush is an arrogant windbag who is almost always wrong and STILL be a conservative. In fact, the fact that you recognize that he is pretty much full of shite makes it more likely that you are a traditional conservative and less likely that you are a militant liberal (a neocon) \n \n \n \n \n \nTrying to insert yourself on the side of the RIGHT in order to justify criticizing it is about as disingenuous as claiming to have used a live hand grenade as a hammer. Oh wait, we've already been down that road, haven't we! Simply put, you're about as politically conservative as Marx was or as Obama is so I doubt that any position you take is well thought out or founded in reason. \n\n \n Yep, archie. Been there. You got spanked. \n \n I am about 2 steps to the right of ghengas kahn. Always have been, probably always will be. \n \n \nYou dare to criticize Bush as if he was the worst President we ever had when compared to the misery index we have under Obama, Bush was a true breath of fresh air. This current president who promised total transparency has been the most deceptive and dishonest administration in our storied history as a nation.\n\n \n Yes. I dare to criticize Bush. His administration has for all intents and purposes ended the united states. His foreign policy was absolutely disastrous. His domestic policy was even worse. He got elected by promising a return to conservative government and then passed the most liberal budget the US had ever seen, stripped us of our civil rights, passed the biggest entitlement program in US history.\n \n Obama is dishonest, but you cite the misery index to \"prove\" things were better under bush? The misery index is the unemployment rate added to the inflation rate. The misery index is so high because unemployment is so high. Unemployment is so high because of the recession that was already under way before obama even entered office. \n \n I hardly think you can be giving out honesty lessons. \n \n\n What is so pathetic about people like you is that you think by claiming to be a member of the right, and then criticizing/condemning its leaders, that somehow makes you deep and honestly objective. Well balderdash; it makes you a complete jerk and an uninformed blowhard since you haven't the insight to objectively see that the LEFT is the real problem for this country and if not for the legislation of the liberals/progressives when Bush was president, the banking and real estate collapse never would have happened. Let me remind you of some undeniable facts.\n \n Note the dates of these warnings from Republicans, and the denials by Barney Frank & co. that any problems existed: YouTube - Democrats were WARNED of Financial crisis and did NOTHING \n\n \n See, you are one of those nitwits that does not even understand what happened in the financial collapse. Fannie May and Freddie Mac were NOT the problem. They did not collapse and take the economy down. NON CONFORMING loans were the problem....Non Conforming means \"loans fannie and freddy would not touch\". \n \n\n Here's more in their own words as they deny a problem even existed: YouTube - Shocking Video Unearthed Democrats in their own words Covering up the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac Scam that caused our Economic Crisis\n \n\n \n \n Uh...no. Steve would be better suited to explain what they were talking about, because it was all about their book keeping and was in absolutely no way the cause of the financial crisis. \n \n What caused our financial crisis was the deregulation of the banking industry. In the past, loaning $400,000 to somebody with no visible income was a federal crime. We deregulated our financial industry, and never really had regulations when it came to rating securities, and banks were able to make those insanely risky loans, securitize them, cut them into traches based solely on repayment order, and sell them as AAA securities. \n \n 93% of the GSEs losses are on loans that they purchased between 2005 and 2007....that they were DIRECTED to purchase by the republican congress and the republican president. They were running the government like a business....the housing market was red hot, they ordered fannie and freddy to double down on subprime paper because it was rated AAA because of this neat new tranching thing that wall street was doing (that was a federal crime up until Bush and the republican congress made it NOT a federal crime in 2002 when they finished deregulating financial markets). \n \n The other 6% of their losses are from loans made in 2008 and 2009...again that they were directed to make in an attempt to stabilize the housing market. \n \n The absolute ignorance in your post...I mean really mind blowing, inexcusable ignorance, really helps prove my point about nitwits who get their news from an entertainment source. \n \n \nSo go ahead and continue to blame Bush as you claim to be on the right side of the aisle, you just confirm for all the informed among us how easily manipulated and deceived you are since you are either as ignorant or disingenuous as the leftists you claim to oppose. My opinion is, you are both...\n \n \n\n \n Why dont you point out some of my liberal positions on issues??? Occasionally in the past you have tried, only to be shown as a fool when it is shown that YOUR position is the liberal one....or just plain stupid and based on complete and total ignorance of the topic....almost like you are getting your news from an entertainer instead of a news source that is known for accuracy.",

   "We can b*tch about this until we are blue in the face but the fact remains this will not ever change. It has been this way for almost 250 years. In fact, at times, it has been worse. \n \n The best way to solve this inevitable dilemma is to simply limit what the government can do. This works perfectly in most states. In Virginia you get 60-90 days to pass stuff and you have to balance a budget. They still bicker but if they do it for too long they basically run into the time they'd normally be working a real job and thus are not getting paid their REAL paycheck. Furthermore, you don't see a lot of lobbyist pressure winning out because at the end of the day you have to balance a budget. Handouts only work if the money supply is there. Raising taxes to give someone a handout is a one way ticket back to your district with those citizens waiting for you. \n \n The beauty of the US constitution (and many state ones modeled after/before it) was that it accounted for stupidity but limiting what you can do and who can do it. Perhaps there is more hope in going back to that standard than trying to get everyone to \"get along\".\n\n \n I agree.....except that now people are not even smart enough to recognize the relative benefits of a limited government. The fact that under the US constitution marriage and abortion do not fall under the purview of the federal government AT ALL does not matter. They dont WANT it to matter. They are not happy outlawing gay marriage or abortion in THEIR state, they want somebody to FORCE it on ALL the states. They are not happy working on education in THEIR state, they want to load a bunch of BS federal mandates on ALL the states. They are not happy regulating working conditions in THEIR state, they want to force OSHA on ALL the states. \n \n To some degree it has been a slow process, and maybe it is just that the more power the federal government takes, the more people get used to it, and the more they assume the federal government should have. \n \n We seem to have actually regressed in this area. I dont know if it is because we, as a nation, started out as a very transitory people and now we have become less so, or if maybe it is the loss of the frontier, or maybe it is because we were at one time truly a nation of immigrants, so we understood that people were different...one size did not fit all. At one time Americans generally realized that laws that made absolute sense in New York city were silly in Dodge City. Now it seems like we lack the depth to recognize that people in other parts of the country are different from us, and having the federal government force them to live by laws that make sense for us is not a good thing to do.",

I believe Rush is right in all of his criticisms of progressivism in america today and the threat it poses for our country's economic and national security.

He got elected by promising a return to conservative government and then passed the most liberal budget the US had ever seen, stripped us of our civil rights, passed the biggest entitlement program in US history.\n\n \n What a wonderfully insightful conservative critique of Bush's tenure in office. Sure Daewoo, you're a true conservative as you deny and ignore completely the video evidence I posted that proved that the republicans and Bush himself warned of the very banking practices which led to the mortgage debacle and ultimate collapse while Barney Frank, Chris Dodd and the rest of the liberals insisted that no problem existed. \n \n Your complete diatribe below which isn't worth responding to just perpetrates lies and misinformation about the actual cause of the collapse which have by the way, become the standard talking points of the left in order to deflect responsibility for causing our current economic situation.\n \n \nObama is dishonest, but you cite the misery index to \"prove\" things were better under bush? The misery index is the unemployment rate added to the inflation rate. The misery index is so high because unemployment is so high. Unemployment is so high because of the recession that was already under way before obama even entered office.\n\n \n The question is what precipitated the recession and the high unemployment rates that currently exist. And the answer to that was given in those videos above that showed that republicans were warning about the mortgage and banking practices as early as 2002 and the collapse they would lead to while the dems denied and defended the status quo which led to 400,000 dollar mortgages being given to house keepers who earned $14,000 a year, all in the name of social justice and equality. \n \n \nI hardly think you can be giving out honesty lessons.\n \n \n Really? Feel free to post any lies I have participated in here at any time, and then I'll post your best. Deal?

Those videos were completely and totally unrelated to the cause of the financial collapse. Freddy and Fannies internal accounting have nothing to do with it. \n \n The dems also had nothing to do with $400,000 mortgages being given to people who could not afford them. That was 100%, without question, Bush and the republican congress. Before the financial deregulation that Bush and his republican congress passed, it was LITERALLY a federal crime. They made it legal. That is how they managed to crash the entire economy with bad mortgages and nobody went to jail.\n \n This is not hard. \n \n \n \n\n Really? Feel free to post any lies I have participated in here at any time, and then I'll post your best. Deal?

That means that either you were being dishonest, OR, you are so dumb you did not know what the misery index actually is. So, you are either dishonest or an idiot. Which is it?\n \n \n \n \nYou'll never learn daewoo; you know, that you just can't keep insisting your right and then be declared right. I posted actual youtube videos from congress itself that showed the republican politicians warning of an impending collapse if nothing was done to change the mortgage practices and more video of the democrats defending and denying that any problems existed as the blocked votes to fix the system which eventually responded just as the republicans warned about. \n\n \n OMG!!! Actual youtube videos!! Irrefutable evidence for sure...except even the youtube videos you post do not show what you seem to thing they do.\n \n \nAs usual I post evidence and you respond with unsubstantiated drivel as you continue to insist you're right. Some things never change when dealing with arrogant ignorant schmucks. \n \n\n \n You did not post any evidence. Maybe this is the problem. Your argument here does not make any logical sense at all. NONE. The \"evidence\" you posted is completely unrelated to what you claim it proves. \n \n From the financial crisis inquiry commissions final report:\n http://fcic-static.law.stanford.edu/cdn_media/fcic-reports/fcic_final_report_conclusions.pdf\n \n\n We conclude that these two entities contributed to the crisis, but were not a primary cause. Importantly, GSE mortgage securities essentially maintained their value throughout the crisis and did not contribute to the significant financial firm losses that were central to the financial crisis.\n\n \n The \"cause\" of the crisis at its most basic was that suddenly trillions of dollars worth of securities turned out to be worthless. The fact that the GSE paper held its value is a pretty good indicator (most would say incontrovertible evidence) that they were not the cause of the financial crisis.\n \n \nThe Commission also probed the performance of the loans purchased or guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie. While they generated substantial losses, delinquency rates for GSE loans were substantially lower than loans securitized by other financial firms. \n\n \n In fact, they were 6.2% vs 28.3%.\n \n you can download the entire report at Get the Report : Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission \n \n It is 600 pages, but well worth the time to download and read. Granted watching a youtube video put together by an anonymous person that has absolutely nothing at all to do with the subject at hand is easier, and you can take solace in the fact that the idiot who made the video is just as clueless as you are, since they apparently also did not realize that the conclusions they were drawing from the videos made no sense at all.\n \n The benefit to downloading and reading the report, though, is that you dont look like an idiot because you are trying to claim that the democrats were responsible for the economic crash because 10 years ago they defended freddie and fannies book keeping practices....which is totally and completely unrelated to the cause of the financial crash. \n \n \n \nAh, the old show me where I'm liberal defense. Really daewoo, you make it to easy. How about this very exchange and this very post I'm responding to. Have you criticized the left at all? You have attacked Bush and blamed the republicans for this entire financial melt down. I don't know of one remotely informed conservative who would do that given the reality of the situation. You even excuse Obama for this current economy even though he's been in charge for over 2 years.\n\n \n Nitwit, I am asking for you to give me a single example of a liberal position I have taken on something. \n \n You come close when you say I blame the republicans for the entire financial melt down. That would certainly be a very liberal position to take. Also an uninformed one that I do NOT take. Our leadership over the last 50 years is ultimately responsible for the meltdown. If I had to pick the person MOST responsible for the meltdown, I would say Alan Greenspan, and he is not even a politician. Not only did the ultra low rates he gave us following the dot com crash directly fuel the housing bubble, but he has actively championed every financial deregulation bill since Reagan was in the white house. That deregulation put us in the position we are in and for him to lobby in favor of it as the head of the federal reserve was not only irresponsible but a gross conflict of interests. \n \n Now, could you pick a liberal position that I actually HOLD??? It cant be one you assume I hold. One I have actually supported. Saying Rush is a windbag who spews disinformation and spreads ignorance is not a liberal position, it is just a fact. \n \n \nIf his economic agenda was working, don't you think we would be seeing an upswing in employment by now? Every single thing this stupid president has done has held us in this morass of a declining economy. He's either the dumbest president we've had since Carter or he is purposely attempting to collapse our capitalist system in order to replace it with a socialist model. And that is precisely what I believe he is doing since I don't think he is so stupid that he is doing these things that are known to have always failed for every country that has ever attempted them.\n\n \n The fact the US has not become a third world nation shows that our economic policies are holding it together, because that was quite literally the stakes we were playing with.\n \n The economic collapse was bigger than any in US history. Bigger than the dot com bust by several ordered of magnitude. Bigger than the ag crash, bigger than the stagflation we saw in the 70s. It was literally bigger than the GREAT DEPRESSION. And you dont think it was handled well because of sub 10% unemployment? I guess you really cant please the XXXXXX...they just arent bright enough to understand how good they have it.\n \n Note I do not mention Obama anywhere in the above paragraphs. Do you know why? Because for the most part the presidents economic policies have nothing to do with how the nation does economicall. There are some exceptions. For example, when Carter put Volker in the fed he knew Volker would do what had to be done to break the back of inflation, so that decision had a major impact on the US economy. \n \n Obama has made no such decisions. He has not really made a major economic decision since he made it into the oval office. The bailouts (TARP, AIG, etc..) and stimulus were Bush programs. The reality is that there is not a whole lot that he can do to impact the economy either way. Congress and the president can collectively impact the economy, as Bush and Clinton both did with their deregulation bills, but those fundamental changes typically take years to materialize (I am hard on Bush only because they specifically decriminalized something that SHOULD HAVE BEEN ILLEGAL, and people conducting that previously criminal activity was directly responsible for the crash. If they had not made it legal for those junk loans to be made and securitized, they would not have been made. There would have been no crisis. \n \n \n \n\n My question to you is, why aren't you smart enough to recognize what is happening? But that question goes without asking because evidently you're so stupid you don't even know your a flaming liberal. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n I do recognize what is happening because I make my decisions based on facts, a conservative trait, They are not based on some XXXX I saw on youtube that I did not actually understand. \n \n This was explained to me very simply when I was a kid. Conservatives are realists. Liberals tend to be idealists. \n \n To be a realist, you need reality, which means you need fact. It is impossible to be a conservative and be ignorant. It is easy to be a CINO and be ignorant, as you prove here.",

Every argument against free markets I have ever encountered typically tracks back to some government regulation such that the essential material of the so called damaging deregulation is that the removal of some regulation toppled a particular house of cards that was in the first place entirely artificial and unnecessary.\n \n It is like claiming that all attempts to move the roman empire towards an equal opportunity organization are domed to failure because rome is essentially a military establishment and every such move results in rebellion and anarchy sprouting up.\n \n True, but that is because you built rome that way.\n \n You seem to feel yourself totally justified in completly ignoring any moral analysis I offer, while there is no excuse for such self-induced blindness it seems to me that you hardly even make an attempt even in your purely accountant world, where all ethical elements including the base of all political economies is whited out; to justify what you are saying.\n \n Who is it who gives artificial financial securities to banks? God?\n\n \n I ignore your moral analysis because it is silly and does not make any sense.\n \n As far as the rest, our entire economy, in fact ANY modern economy, is based in large part on artificial instruments. In fact, our currency is an artificial instrument. Otherwise we are back to bartering. Even base metals have only ever been really valuable because people agreed that they are. From a purely logical standpoint you cant eat gold or silver. It will not keep the rain off you. It makes a terrible weapon, and an even worse plow. It is valuable as a way to fund transactions because way back in human history it was pretty, rare, and easy to work, so easy to turn into pretty baubles. Go somewhere that people are really, genuinely poor (usually war torn african countries) and you will find you cant actually buy anything with gold because truly poor people need food, shelter, and basic tools, not pretty baubles. \n \n If we are going to have an economy NOT based on barter, the only \"natural\" economy, you have to have regulation. Our synthetic economy is pretty much the creation of our government and regulation defines the structure of that economy.",

Gold did not come into wide spread use as a trade metal until it was pounded into coins. Differences in purity and weights used made it difficult to impossible for it to be used in normal trade, and you were taking a risk by accepting it. Silver was the same way. For a while there were what amounted to private mints that minted coins of a guaranteed purity and of standard weight. There were a couple BIG problems with this. First, if you were not familiar with the mint that has produced the coin, you didnt know what value to assign it. Second, it turned out that without any kind of regulation, those private mints had a tendency to debase their coinage. And why not? There was nobody telling them that they could not.\n \n Metals did not become a standard store of value until governments started regulating the minting of their coins. They set the standards for the weight and composition of their coins, which gave the people the confidence they needed to accept them as a store of value. \n \n Even today, you can buy gold nuggets CHEAP compared to the spot price of gold. You can collect them all up in a box, and not buy a damn thing with them because nobody actually knows how much gold is actually in them. You can purify it yourself and tell people \"I promise you it is pure gold\" but that is not going to get you very far. \n \n I read an interesting blog post a while back by a guy who lives in Argentina and was there when the economy imploded. He said that you could still buy things with silver, but you may as well buy junk silver jewelry as good, proofed silver because nobody had any way of knowing what the actual silver content was on anything, so it all traded as junk.

So, there is $200,000 more circulating in the economy, but the money was created to pay for a $200,000 house...so it was essentially created against the production of $200,000 in physical wealth. \n \n Prosecute fraud? First we have to define fraud, and fraud is defined by the regulations the government puts on the market. I know you have an ultra simplistic view on this where \"fraud\" = \"dishonesty\" but the world is not that simple. \n \n I actually had a conversation this afternoon with a local guy, a young guy with a huge amount of potential, who has just gotten a business up and rolling.

Even with all the regulations we have on the books, both ways are a 100% LEGAL way to present his balance sheet. \n \n We literally sat at my kitchen table and ran the numbers both ways. I would swear on a stack of bibles that both ways are 100% CORRECT. Any judge, lawyer, ethicist, or priest on the planet earth would look at either one of those balance sheets and tell you there is nothing at all wrong with how either is done. And yet one shows him holding a little over $2.6 million in assets (and that is a VERY conservative number), the other only shows $14,000. \n \n The truth is that the world is a complex place. While there is a certain appeal to your simplistic view that either something is right or it is wrong and where \"no fraud\" is all you need to regulate financial markets reality is that the world is FAR more complex than that. Even with all the regulations we have, that guy can present himself and his company either way and be 100% in the clear. \n \n What regulation does is provide confidence to market participants which allows your market to function. There has been no time in human history where non barter markets existed without regulation. 2000 years ago local guilds were setting the standard weight for a sack of wool at their markets and punishing merchants for shorting customers. The reason people dont particularly care what gas station they get their fuel at is that somewhere on that pump there is a sticker that says a state inspector has tested that pump and found that it measures the gallons of fuel being dispensed correctly. You dont have to test the fuel to make sure it is compatible with your vehicle because there are federal regulations that ensure that the fuel you are putting in there meet certain minimum standards. You can put money in your bank and feel safe about it because your deposits are insured, and there are regulations on the banks to ensure they do not do anything stupid and end up shut down. \n \n The financial crisis was a good example of what happens when there are not regulations there to protect you...and even worse, when there are not regulations there to protect you and people believe there are. When they pushed through deregulation it sounded like a good idea. People did not realize that wall street would use it to stop rating securities based on the underlying asset values and start rating them on repayment order. Allowing investors to decide who to lend money to without government interference makes sense...until they make bad loans using YOUR money. Allowing them some book keeping flexibility sounds like a good idea...until they use that flexibility to move all their bad assets into SIVs and move them off the books, or use repo agreements to move them off the balance sheet just long enough to file your quarterly reports.",

The exception was old coinage from the US and other nations that contained silver....they traded at market because the content was known.\n \n Really. This all amounts to a strawman; regulation of minting is not regulation of the unit value.\n \n A coin with a roman seal was would tell someone that the coin was pure gold of a certain weight; not how much that gold was worth. That was still determined by the market at large.\n \n If Rome got into financial trouble (and it did several times) it could not mint more gold than it had. If it had started to put out impure coins and claim they were pure gold that would be equivalent to how paper currency is being used now.\n \n If they assured some governor that he could build anything he wanted and if his city ever got into trouble they would start minting copper coins which by law were worth as much as gold ones. That is regulation.\n \n \nHolding the number of currency units static leads to chronic deflation. There can not be any other possible outcome.\n\n No there cannot, it's fine with me. It would reflect what is really going on in the market.\n \n \nThe way fiat currency systems are supposed to work is that money is borrowed into existence to fund the purchase of production of real goods. You borrow $200,000 to buy a house, that money is essentially borrowed into existence. So, there is $200,000 more circulating in the economy, but the money was created to pay for a $200,000 house...so it was essentially created against the production of $200,000 in physical wealth.\n\n Only one problem, wealth cannot be borrowed into existance.\n \n Anyone who takes such a loan is borrowing against the market in general. If they don't create 200,000 in physical wealth everyone else's money has gotten more useless regardless. You want to take 200,000 back?\n \n I hardly need to argue the point though, if you were correct and the arbitrary units were maintaining their ratio with real value inflation would be zero, or at least fluctuate around a very small difference.\n \n If you truly wanted a stable currency with a fixed unit of wealth, you would only print it in response to deflation. The most accurate way to calculate deflation would be relative to something with a known stable value; like bullion, so wow I don't know why anyone would ever use precious medals as currency eh?\n \n However; there is no reason to go through that. Let a fixed number of units represent not a fixed value but a fixed percentage of market value; a piece of the pie.\n \n Foolproof and incorruptible.\n \n \nProsecute fraud? First we have to define fraud, and fraud is defined by the regulations the government puts on the market. I know you have an ultra simplistic view on this where \"fraud\" = \"dishonesty\" but the world is not that simple.\n \n ultra simplistic seems to translate to objective here.\n \n In your world you get to redefine things such that they have pretty much the same meaning but you add in a little exception which ultimately means 'unless the local government decides otherwise', for that is what 'against the law' means so long as you accept that the law is the arbitrary determination of the local government.\n \n Murder is unlawful killing? Than the concentration camps weren't murder because the German government legalized it.\n \n Fraud is unlawful economic activity? Than selling or buying a snickers could be fraud so long as someone in the government can make a law against it.\n \n Your definitions lose all... definition.\n \n My definition by the way is \n 1 a : any act, expression, omission, or concealment calculated to deceive another to his or her disadvantage; specifically : a misrepresentation or concealment with reference to some fact material to a transaction that is made with knowledge of its falsity or in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity and with the intent to deceive another and that is reasonably relied on by the other who is injured thereby b : the affirmative defense of having acted in response to a fraud \n \n In other words 'dishonesty about a trade'.\n \nI actually had a conversation this afternoon with a local guy, a young guy with a huge amount of potential, who has just gotten a business up and rolling. He is literally either a multimillionaire or broke, depending on how he does the paperwork. Both ways of doing the paperwork are 100% honest.

While there is a certain appeal to your simplistic view that either something is right or it is wrong and where \"no fraud\" is all you need to regulate financial markets reality is that the world is FAR more complex than that. Even with all the regulations we have, that guy can present himself and his company either way and be 100% in the clear.\n \n The world is a complex place, you won't get an argument from me on that. However when people say \"it's more complex than that\", they usually aren't talking about complexity; they are usually talking about relativism. They mean 'The viewpoints do not agree and it's too complex to sort through'.\n \n The appeal of what you are calling simplicity is clarity of thought. Science is beautiful, it is like a weather system moving across a beautiful country (knowledge), before it lies a vast confused storm. The storm is composed of dogma, superstition, conjecture, sophistry, and conflicting voices. Some stare at the storm and despair because the chaos is unfathomable.\n \n Yet the scientists of the world, not just scientist of the modern sense of the word but anyone who believes they can consistently apply logic to understand and solve; have ever pushed the storm and opened more of the land to the sun. The land is not chaotic, it is complex to but in a wonderful way, it exhibits patterns; these patterns allow the abstraction of it's complexity into categorical organization. There look at that structure, how complex is the shape but we can call it a mountain, and on the mountain are trees and leaves and bumps and erosion channels; In the erosion channels are rocks and sand; and the sand is made up of different types of matter that we can identify.\n \n What a vast 'simplification' it is to call all that a mountain?\n \n That is how true knowledge exists daewoo, the sword of reason is logic; but it's shield which defends the knowledge gained is precision of definition and consistency of categorization.\n \n It is little wonder that all fades to hopeless chaos when you aren't sure what your definitions mean, if you are willing to undercut them with exceptions, or if you refuse to even believe there can be definitions.\n \n Only men can corrupt their own concepts so I can promise you that I believe it wholeheartedly when I say that the 'problems' you see in any change to the status quo are entirely generated by the confusion of others or inherited from our past.\n \n I use the past for examples often as well; many baseless assertions can be disproved by showing that it was once otherwise; but never should you believe that just because it has never been one way it can never be in the future.\n \n In this case men have based their currency on precious metals and other real values, and it did not shatter the space time continuum.\n \n We are of course free to discuss the merits or detriments all we want; but I will never accept the avoidance of logical analysis on the absurdity that complexity should be met with anything but especially invigorated rational examination. Where did you say that? That is what I hear when I read 'over-\n simplistic', 'silly', 'foolish', and 'childish'.\n \n Why do you do it? It drives me mad with curiosity but you think silence is preferable to communication? What do you expect others to think then?\n \n \nWhat regulation does is provide confidence to market participants which allows your market to function. There has been no time in human history where non barter markets existed without regulation. 2000 years ago local guilds were setting the standard weight for a sack of wool at their markets and punishing merchants for shorting customers.

You can put money in your bank and feel safe about it because your deposits are insured, and there are regulations on the banks to ensure they do not do anything stupid and end up shut down. \n\n I am all for standards, but standards are not the same as regulation.\n \n Are you familiar with the computer parts industry?\n \n They have set up their standards almost entirely without government help. PCI - HDMI\n \n The sticker approving compatibilities are numerous, but none of these companies has crossed the line and tried to use threat of force to stop other standards.\n \n The standards that have won have done so on their merits and the merits of the companies that championed them.\n \n Is it so high a price that the customer should have to look for that sticker on the gas pump for the preservation of liberty?\n \n Banks are another deal entirely, the government as it is doesn't have the right to back up loans; the money is being backed entirely by artificial methods of removing wealth from the market by force.\n \n You could essentially accomplish the same thing by giving banks the right to confiscate wealth in their area until they can meet all withdrawals.\n \n It is the banks responsibility to insure their capital, it is there right not to. I am sure that a standard 'secure banking' contract could be devised which banks must sign for the right to advertise their 'sticker'; but other than that or something similar you simply don't have the right regardless of how you think it may help the economy.\n \n It is up to the consumer to find suppliers who meet their terms, it has always been so. We cannot morally and we cannot practically set those terms for them. A government dictate on how a genre of company may exist is just as damaging as a government dictate on which company may exist (monopolies).\n \n \nThe financial crisis was a good example of what happens when there are not regulations there to protect you...and even worse, when there are not regulations there to protect you and people believe there are. When they pushed through deregulation it sounded like a good idea. People did not realize that wall street would use it to stop rating securities based on the underlying asset values and start rating them on repayment order. Allowing investors to decide who to lend money to without government interference makes sense...until they make bad loans using YOUR money.\n\n Giving the power to the government to decide who you can lend money to makes sense... until they stop you from making good loans using YOUR money.\n \n From the capital provider to the bank that makes the final loan someone would stop and consider the risks... unless they felt there was a regulation to protect them from that responsibility.\n \n Regulation is a self-reinforcing argument, people believe they do not need to do their own homework because the government will protect them from bad investments; so they don't; then when something leaks through the regulations it is claimed that there weren't enough.\n \n The message the market would naturally be transmitting to investors is 'your hopes are too high, make more secure investments' however what would naturally happen is up for debate. Many including me don't believe there would have ever been a crisis without the regulation on loans.\n \n \nAllowing them some book keeping flexibility sounds like a good idea...until they use that flexibility to move all their bad assets into SIVs and move them off the books, or use repo agreements to move them off the balance sheet just long enough to file your quarterly reports.\n\n Strong market pressure for full investment agencies to provide contracts crafted to remove all doubt from investors minds.",

Money is green pieces of paper with pictures of dead presidents on them. \n \n\n Anyone who takes such a loan is borrowing against the market in general. If they don't create 200,000 in physical wealth everyone else's money has gotten more useless regardless. You want to take 200,000 back?\n\n \n Wrong. They are borrowing against future income in order to repay the $200,000 that was borrowed into existence against the real value of the tangible asset. \n \n \nI hardly need to argue the point though, if you were correct and the arbitrary units were maintaining their ratio with real value inflation would be zero, or at least fluctuate around a very small difference.\n\n \n First, I am correct. There is no question of that. Note I say the way fiat currency systems are supposed to work. \n \n You get inflation from 2 sources in a fiat currency system. The first is from overprinting (what the fed is doing now). The second is through devaluation of the tangible assets that the money was borrowed into existence to purchase. \n \n \n \n \nIn your world you get to redefine things such that they have pretty much the same meaning but you add in a little exception which ultimately means 'unless the local government decides otherwise', for that is what 'against the law' means so long as you accept that the law is the arbitrary determination of the local government.\n \n Murder is unlawful killing?

You can present a balance sheet many different ways, all of them 100% factual an honest, that present far different pictures. \n \n \nThe world is a complex place, you won't get an argument from me on that. However when people say \"it's more complex than that\", they usually aren't talking about complexity; they are usually talking about relativism. They mean 'The viewpoints do not agree and it's too complex to sort through'.\n \n The appeal of what you are calling simplicity is clarity of thought.

The storm is composed of dogma, superstition, conjecture, sophistry, and conflicting voices. Some stare at the storm and despair because the chaos is unfathomable.\n\n \n Wrong. The appeal of what I am calling simplicity is LACK of thought. \n \n Lets say you have $10 million worth of non depreciating manufactured goods sitting in a warehouse. Obviously that should count as an asset, less marketing costs, overhead, and transport. We will call that 20%. So, you have an $8 million asset sitting in a warehouse. WHOO HOO, you are rich. You are a millionaire!! But, you have no marketing, transport, or cash available. Are you still rich? That $8 million in assets only becomes valuable if you can sell it...otherwise it is just taking up space. \n \n You can look at it both ways and both are completely honest. Say you are going to the bank to try to raise some money so you can put the people in place to sell your $8 million worth of widgets. Obviously you list that $8 million worth of widgets as assets, you need to borrow money against them to put your sales and transport in place. No banker is going to disagree with you and claim they are not assets. \n \n Say, on the other hand, you go down to apply for food stamps because you have no money to buy food. Do you list that $8 million in assets on your application? Of course not. If you cant sell them, they are not assets, they are essentially without value. They are junk. Any social worker would tell you the same thing. \n \n How can that be? You have just filled out 2 forms in one day, on one you are a millionaire, on the other you are destitute, and they are both true?? You have certainly filled the forms out for your own gain, and they say the opposite about you, but you have committed not fraud. What is an asset to your banker is not an asset to your social worker because to the banker the goods hold value sitting in the warehouse, while to the social worker they only hold value once they are sold so you can buy food. If you cant sell them, they are without value. \n \n That is about the simplest example I can come up with. Decisions like that, but FAR more complex, come up in business all the time. It is not about shifting morals, or relativism. The simple minded solutions you champion simply do not exist. \n \n \n \n\n In this case men have based their currency on precious metals and other real values, and it did not shatter the space time continuum.\n\n \n Yes, they have. But only after governments stepped in to regulate them.\n \n \nWe are of course free to discuss the merits or detriments all we want; but I will never accept the avoidance of logical analysis on the absurdity that complexity should be met with anything but especially invigorated rational examination. Where did you say that? That is what I hear when I read 'over-\n simplistic', 'silly', 'foolish', and 'childish'.\n\n \n I have not seen invigorated rational examination out of you yet. Just a bunch of simplistic, silly, foolish, childish ideas based on a moral code that apparently only you understand that is itself based on a childishly simple understanding of reality. \n \n \nGiving the power to the government to decide who you can lend money to makes sense... until they stop you from making good loans using YOUR money.\n \n From the capital provider to the bank that makes the final loan someone would stop and consider the risks... unless they felt there was a regulation to protect them from that responsibility.\n \n Regulation is a self-reinforcing argument, people believe they do not need to do their own homework because the government will protect them from bad investments; so they don't; then when something leaks through the regulations it is claimed that there weren't enough.\n \n The message the market would naturally be transmitting to investors is 'your hopes are too high, make more secure investments' however what would naturally happen is up for debate. Many including me don't believe there would have ever been a crisis without the regulation on loans.\n\n \n Those many are fools. The entire crisis was caused by the fact that wall street figured out an unregulated way to make those loans. They could not have made those bad loans as traditional mortgage loans because it would have been illegal for them to do so. There are regulations about loan quality for all loans that an FDIC insured bank makes. \n \n After the deregulation of the last 2 decades, they could, however, securitize those bad loans and sell them off without any regulation whatsoever. It is just plain stupid to think that there would have been no crisis without the regulation on loans when it was the UNREGULATED loans that caused the crisis. Standard bank held mortgages did not suffer at all. Their value did not change and their default rate did not increase. Likewise GSE originated loans (freddie and fannie) held their value and their default rates never topped 6.2%. Why? Because there are regulations that govern the loan quality of GSE originated loans. They are not allowed to loan $400,000 to a crack whore with no visible means of support. There were no such regulations preventing countrywide from originating such a loan and securitizing it themselves, which is why currently over 28% of loans that countrywide originated are in default and that number keeps climbing. \n \n Your statement may literally be the most asinine thing I have ever seen on a forum. It is absolutely ridiculous and indefensible and shows a complete and total lack of knowledge of the subject. \n \n Pathetic. Why dont you go over to the religious forum and dazzle them with your moral theories for a while. You are contributing nothing at all of value anywhere else.",

   "No, it is not....nor are any of the financial regulations we have in the US today. Regulation of minting is regulation of quality, which is what virtually ALL financial regulations are\n\n Quality of companies work, not quality of currencies authenticity.\n \n The difference is that you are comparing the certainty that the coin is gold with certainty that the fruit at the market is delicious.\n \n They are not the same thing because you need to control a private entities activities to make an attempt at the latter while you need only control your own minting process for the former.\n \n \nHow is that a problem? Nobody has suggested that wealth has been borrowed into existence. The money was borrowed into existence. Money is green pieces of paper with pictures of dead presidents on them. \n\n The green pieces of paper are supposed to represent wealth, if they are borrowed into existance but no wealth is; they are meaningless.\n \n \nWrong. They are borrowing against future income in order to repay the $200,000 that was borrowed into existence against the real value of the tangible asset. \n\n Why do they need to repay the imaginary wealth? If they didn't succeed than no wealth exists for that currency. You are basically saying that you must commit to create this much wealth.\n \n This is artificial.\n \n \nFirst, I am correct.\n\n Second you are not.\n \nThere is no question of that.\n\n Then shutup and quit like you have before. Debate is to answer that question.\n \nNote I say the way fiat currency systems are supposed to work. \n \n You get inflation from 2 sources in a fiat currency system. The first is from overprinting (what the fed is doing now). The second is through devaluation of the tangible assets that the money was borrowed into existence to purchase. \n\n Interesting how you differentiate the two :p\n \n Wasn't I just saying that the money shouldn't be borrowed into existance because the wealth is not necessarily being created and definitely not being created of any natural investment capital.\n \n Didn't I just say that this would cause valueless money to enter circulation, causing inflation?\n \n \nExcept no objective definitions were used. \n \n\n That's a problem isn't it.\n \n \nWrong.\n\n Right.\n \nThe appeal of what I am calling simplicity is LACK of thought. \n\n Failure to think causes confusion, not oversimplification.\n \n \nLets say you have $10 million worth of non depreciating manufactured goods sitting in a warehouse. Obviously that should count as an asset, less marketing costs, overhead, and transport. We will call that 20%. So, you have an $8 million asset sitting in a warehouse. WHOO HOO, you are rich. You are a millionaire!! But, you have no marketing, transport, or cash available. Are you still rich? That $8 million in assets only becomes valuable if you can sell it...otherwise it is just taking up space. \n \n You can look at it both ways and both are completely honest. Say you are going to the bank to try to raise some money so you can put the people in place to sell your $8 million worth of widgets. Obviously you list that $8 million worth of widgets as assets, you need to borrow money against them to put your sales and transport in place. No banker is going to disagree with you and claim they are not assets. \n \n Say, on the other hand, you go down to apply for food stamps because you have no money to buy food. Do you list that $8 million in assets on your application? Of course not. If you cant sell them, they are not assets, they are essentially without value. They are junk. Any social worker would tell you the same thing. \n \n How can that be? You have just filled out 2 forms in one day, on one you are a millionaire, on the other you are destitute, and they are both true?? You have certainly filled the forms out for your own gain, and they say the opposite about you, but you have committed not fraud. What is an asset to your banker is not an asset to your social worker because to the banker the goods hold value sitting in the warehouse, while to the social worker they only hold value once they are sold so you can buy food. If you cant sell them, they are without value. \n\n Wonderful example. See what evil subjectivism has wrought upon the world?\n \n The person in this example is being dishonest. He is using two definitions of asset. Asset could not fit both or else he would be forced to tell the social worker he had 8mil, asset could not fit neither or else he would be forced to tell the bank he had nothing.\n \n So you want to regulate something? Put out an official definition of asset and how to calculate it.\n \n \nThat is about the simplest example I can come up with. Decisions like that, but FAR more complex, come up in business all the time. It is not about shifting morals, or relativism. The simple minded solutions you champion simply do not exist. \n\n Yes they do. Coming up with examples of inadequately defined terms only strengthens my previous conviction that objectivity is an ideal.\n \n \nYes, they have. But only after governments stepped in to regulate them.\n\n The quality of the units, not the value.\n \n \nI have not seen invigorated rational examination out of you yet.

Or the certainty that the companies quarterly reports actually reflect the companies economic situation. \n \n Our financial regulations are exactly the same as the regulations nations in the past have used when it came to minting metal coins.

It is a fiat currency. Gold and silver are no better. If you take a pig and sell it, and are paid in gold, the gold represents the value of that pig.

It can be used decoratively, but then so can spray paint. The only reason gold is valuable is that we have agreed it is valuable. If tomorrow we decided it was not valuable and it had to count on its utility as a decoration and in some limited industrial production to support its price, it would be cheaper than copper. \n \n That is why they have managed to make fiat currencies work. When the US left the gold standard a lot of people were certain our currency would crash and burn immediately.

Put out an official definition of asset and how to calculate it.\n\n \n That is not possible because what may be an asset in one situation may not be in another, as I clearly showed above. \n \n We can go even one step further with this. So, our guy who either has $8 million in assets or does not, depending in whether you are a social worker or a banker, goes home and while he is waiting for either his $1 million loan to show up or his food stamps, he decides to sit down and do some cash flow analysis. Now, he has $8 million worth of product sitting in a warehouse ready to load on trucks as soon as his banker gets his paperwork done. In the mean time, he has to pay for that warehouse, then there is maintenance and utilities at the warehouse. He has no choice. He has to store and maintain his stuff, and that costs money. So suddenly the $8 million in product is not actually an asset at all, it is a liability with fixed costs. So, now, depending on how you want to look at it, the guy is either a millionaire, broke, or $200,000 in the hole. \n \n \n \nYes they do. Coming up with examples of inadequately defined terms only strengthens my previous conviction that objectivity is an ideal.\n\n \n Asset is not an inadequately defined term. The definition is straightforward. It is the situation that has changed.\n \n Two guys are both holding rifles.\n One is a soldier getting ready to go into battle. To him, the rifle is an asset.\n The other is a marathon runner at the starting line. To him the rifle is a liability. \n \n This is not that hard to understand. \n \n \nThe quality of the units, not the value.\n\n \n The value of the unit is defined by the quality. \n \n \n \nDid they lie about the loans risk? Is there even some standard for determining that risk?\n\n \n No and no. If those loans had fallen under the governments regulatory authority there would have been standards for determining the risk. Since they did not, Countrywide was able to create their own standards which, not surprisingly, showed that the loans were extremely safe. \n \n \n \nUh huh.

Which is why we did not just have a financial crisis....er....uh...never mind.\n \n What we saw leading up to the crisis was EXACTLY the unregulated system you keep arguing in favor of. You cant claim that regulations caused the crisis...there were none. Those securitized mortgages that exploded were completely unregulated. They WERE all rated by third party analysts. This was all graded bond paper. And OF COURSE there were contractual clauses about defaults. In fact, since these were tranched based on repayment order, there was FAR more default oriented language in the prospectus than you see anywhere else in the financial world. \n \n \n \nWhy don't you put me on ignore? you know you want to.\n\n \n Bored.

The reason we have decided gold is valuable is that it is rare and hard to destroy (it does have good conductivity too).\n\n \n Except gold is not rare...not by a long shot. But the vast majority of the gold that we have is locked away in various institutions and being used as reserves. As I noted in my last post, if they quit holding it as reserves and actually depended on its utility to maintain its price, it would be cheaper than copper. \n \n \nThat money has value is not what I was calling artificial, pretending that you can maintain the ratio by obligating people to create a certain amount of wealth if they want to add a certain amount of money to the system.\n \n That could only work in an near ideal world. It is much more sane to think you could keep track of a static amount of currency than to think such a practice would reflect real accurate adjustment.\n\n \n No it wouldnt because you would be constantly in a state of EXTREME deflation. If you are going to have a currency based economy that currency is a placeholder for physical wealth. If you add add tangible value to the economy such as a new house, a new car, a new bulldozer, whatever, you have to create a similar amount of currency to represent that wealth. Otherwise everything you ever manufacture in your economy becomes deflationary. It would take VERY little time before there was simply not enough currency in circulation to keep that economy going. \n \n \n \nNo, as you just finished telling me gold has no value of it's own. Therefore how much it would be valued at in ancient rome would not be the quality of the coin but a market derived value.\n \n Observe: as you pointed out roman authorities did mint their coins all the same, which means they all had the same quality for a long time.\n \n Are you saying that the value of the coins never changed throughout roman history?\n \n Are you saying that by producing uniform gold coins rome somehow set their empire's GDP to zero?\n\n \n No....and I am again wondering exactly how intelligent you are here. The value of the money is still market set, but by regulating the minting of the coin the public has confidence to use the currency and accept it at face value. \n \n The value for a coin that has been minted by the government and that you know is 94.3% pure gold is a LOT easier to discover than the value of some random coin whose content is unknown. \n \n \n \n \nSo you expect me to believe that for no apparent reason people just sucked up these bad loans like candy never being competent enough to check their quality?\n \n Doesn't it seem far more likely that because they thought the government was using force to stop bad loans from even going on the market they didn't check or didn't check well enough?\n\n \n No, they sucked up the loans because the loan issuers convinced them that cutting them into tranches based on repayment order turned those sows ears into silk pursed. \n \n Then they used historic default date for mortgages to calculate assumed default rate for their tranches.\n \n What they did not do was include the fact that the mortgages they were making were MUCH, MUCH riskier than traditional mortgages. Typically a mortgage is either prime or sub prime. Companies created a whole new class of mortgages...the \"screw you we got the origination fee\" mortgage. They just didnt tell anybody this. \n \n Check their quality? Er...uh....we just found out how hard it can be to decide on asset valuation of a single asset you have sitting in a warehouse. Trying to actually check underlying quality in an MBS pool is something that a team of 30 accountants do...and that is if it is even possible for them to do it since in most cases things like the original mortgage application stayed with the originator. \n \n \n \nI doubt that in the extreme.\n\n \n Doubt all you want. I showed that it did. End of story. Your concession is noted. \n \n \n \nOf course I can. People simply do not buy useless product en masse for no reason. If they do and yet the company selling the product has also been honest about every question put to them and about their advertisements and product description you expect me to believe that these people simply went insane or were too stupid to know the value of the product in the first place.\n \n In which case you are basically saying 'if people are too stupid to know what something is worth the government should regulate it's value'.\n \n\n \n No, they bought the worthless product en mass because they did not know it was a worthless product. \n \n Nor am I saying the government should regulate its value. I am saying they should regulate disclosure and, in the case of insured banks, loan quality. \n \n You clearly dont have much, if any, experience working with or understanding complex financial instruments, but it is a LOT more complex than you seem to understand. \n \n Believe what you want, but even the ratings agencies, whose analysts do nothing but inspect and rate bonds did not realize these were going to end up going belly up. The vase majority of them were rated as investment grade bonds. \n \n \nThen what did countrywide have to gain by 'tricking' all their buyers into buying bad loans.\n\n \n Uh...well.....during the buildup to the collapse countrywide made a little more than $200 billion doing it. That is a pretty good incentive. \n \n I am not sure they \"tricked\" anybody, though. They believed that the securities they were selling were actually good. \n \n \nWhat made them think the annalist would not notice or that the contractual clauses would not revert the debt back to them?\n\n \n Again, the analysts apparently didnt notice. \n \n Revert the debt back to them? That would be AWESOME. If you come across any investments like that, where you get to keep the money if they turn out to be good investments but you can charge losses back to whoever sold them to you, let me know. I have never in my life seen such a setup and would LOVE to take advantage of such a sweetheart deal!!!",

They ensure that everybody is using the same methods, which is the only way a prospectus or quarterly report can be made to make sense.\n \n That should be in the former of a 'sticker' which verifies that certain methods have been used in determining the properties of a security. It cannot be a mandate to sell only certain kinds of securities that pass federal inspection.\n \n \nNobody has suggested that we should regulate what securities can be sold. If they regulated what securities could be sold there would be no junk bond market. I dont know of any country, and where, ever, that has prevented low quality securities from being sold. HOWEVER, regulations keep those junk bonds from being dressed up to look like AAA rated securities. \n\n Are you telling me that if right now every 'regulation' you think would prevent this 'problem' went into effect, not a single one would ever force a company to do anything?\n \n \nAre you being deliberately obtuse or are you actually this stupid? \n\n Ad hominem\n \n \nExcept gold is not rare...not by a long shot. But the vast majority of the gold that we have is locked away in various institutions and being used as reserves. As I noted in my last post, if they quit holding it as reserves and actually depended on its utility to maintain its price, it would be cheaper than copper.\n \n You just mentioned stupidity :p\n \n Yes gold is rare, it's utility is besides the point, because it is rare and copper is not no one would dream of using gold instead of copper unless the slight boost in conductivity really mattered.\n \n \nNo it wouldnt because you would be constantly in a state of EXTREME deflation.\n\n You said this before, I agreed it was so before. Do you think that fact is a one sentence defeat of the idea?\n \n In simpler words 'who cares if it is extreme deflation?'.\n \n \nIf you are going to have a currency based economy that currency is a placeholder for physical wealth.\n\n Obviously, but there is no reason that it needs to represent a static amount of wealth. \n \n \nOtherwise everything you ever manufacture in your economy becomes deflationary. It would take VERY little time before there was simply not enough currency in circulation to keep that economy going.\n\n Well let's be clear, if we are able to continue to divide the unit we are always going to be able to work in convenient amounts.\n \n It would take a while yet before a cent is worth too much and we can deal with that when it comes. (like a century from now when we might not be using physical bills much anyway)\n \n The global wealth does not grow that quickly.\n \n \nNo....and I am again wondering exactly how intelligent you are here. The value of the money is still market set, but by regulating the minting of the coin the public has confidence to use the currency and accept it at face value. \n \n The value for a coin that has been minted by the government and that you know is 94.3% pure gold is a LOT easier to discover than the value of some random coin whose content is unknown. \n \n You are relating two unconnected concepts.\n \n How much the gold is worth in ancient rome, and whether or not a coin is gold.\n \n You are implying that controlling the latter sets the former. It cannot be so.\n \n \nNo, they sucked up the loans because the loan issuers convinced them that cutting them into tranches based on repayment order turned those sows ears into silk pursed. \n\n Back to the old carpetbagger argument then?\n \n \nThen they used historic default date for mortgages to calculate assumed default rate for their tranches.\n \n What they did not do was include the fact that the mortgages they were making were MUCH, MUCH riskier than traditional mortgages. Typically a mortgage is either prime or sub prime. Companies created a whole new class of mortgages...the \"screw you we got the origination fee\" mortgage. They just didnt tell anybody this. \n\n So the government needs to regulate any product that is particularly low quality?\n \n Any objective basis to decide when that happens or is it just when 'I am mad cause I lost some money'.\n \n \nCheck their quality? Er...uh....we just found out how hard it can be to decide on asset valuation of a single asset you have sitting in a warehouse. Trying to actually check underlying quality in an MBS pool is something that a team of 30 accountants do...and that is if it is even possible for them to do it since in most cases things like the original mortgage application stayed with the originator. \n \n I wouldn't buy something of which I have no indication of the quality. Would you?\n \n \nDoubt all you want. I showed that it did. End of story. Your concession is noted. \n\n No you said that regulations would have prevented the crisis. If doubting assertions is concession, all debaters concede on the premise of debate.\n \n \nNo, they bought the worthless product en mass because they did not know it was a worthless product. \n\n So someone has to save them from their helpless ignorance?\n \n \nNor am I saying the government should regulate its value. I am saying they should regulate disclosure and, in the case of insured banks, loan quality.\n \n Disclosure is 'regulated', it's fraudulent to lie to your customers about your product.\n \n You simultaneously insist to me that things like asset can't be objectively defined, allowing banks to 'fudge' the portrayal of their securities, while also claiming that regulations must be put in place to prevent such fudging.\n \n Which begs the question, if no one can call the bank on dishonesty; how are the regulations to be formulated to combat the unofficial dishonesty?\n \n To do so you would need to have a list of things they are compelled to reveal.\n \n Yet these things if they are at all relevant (about the product) are also already the fully purview of any potential buyers. They need only ask.\n \n The presumption that regulations can be crafted which accurately identify the risk to buyers necessitates the possibility that the risk can be calculated objectively.... unless the regulations aren't designed to be objective, but instead given in abstract imprecise language, regulations whose effective role is to validate government intervention when ever an official subjectively decides he needs to make people play fair.\n \n \nYou clearly dont have much, if any, experience working with or understanding complex financial instruments, but it is a LOT more complex than you seem to understand. \n\n Uh huh, so if I said you seem totally unaccustomed to philosophical thought, and that it is far more crucial than you could possibly imagine; would you give a ____?\n \n \nBelieve what you want, but even the ratings agencies, whose analysts do nothing but inspect and rate bonds did not realize these were going to end up going belly up. The vase majority of them were rated as investment grade bonds. \n\n I see, well it is a good thing we have god-men accountants working for the government that would be able to formulate the criteria for spotting bad apples and legislate against them while private professionals had no chance.\n \n \nUh...well.....during the buildup to the collapse countrywide made a little more than $200 billion doing it. That is a pretty good incentive. \n\n Which means that even though their merchandise was bad there was no contractual bind which would have reverted the financial failure to them. A no return policy that seemed to be accepted by the buyers. That is what I meant when I was talking about clauses about defaults.\n \n \nI am not sure they \"tricked\" anybody, though. They believed that the securities they were selling were actually good. \n\n The conspiracy is totally without conspirators now, except of course those who removed the so called necessary regulations.\n \n If only they had been in place country wide and others like it wouldn't have been able to fool themselves and their customers into thinking the loans were good. They would of course seen that making high risk loans wasn't actually smart because as we all know regs heighten the mental abilities of the poor volk.\n \n \nAgain, the analysts apparently didnt notice. \n \n Yet are ever clairvoyant congress did, and before this whole mess....\n \n \nRevert the debt back to them? That would be AWESOME. If you come across any investments like that, where you get to keep the money if they turn out to be good investments but you can charge losses back to whoever sold them to you, let me know. I have never in my life seen such a setup and would LOVE to take advantage of such a sweetheart deal!!!\n\n Sure, over a certain percentage of loans default; the debt is reverted.\n \n The bank cannot have net value as a goal or else they would not sell the perceived valuable loans off. They would do so only if they needed more capital upfront.\n \n In which case they wouldn't care about such clauses as they would have been in the best position as anyone to evaluate the risk of the loans.\n \n We aren't talking about first tier investors but investors who are selling their investments.\n \n There are only three reasons they would sell their investment, they have reason to believe the investment is bad so they would make more money by selling it than waiting for it to be paid off (which won't happen), they need capital faster than the investment will return it, or the investment requires further capital they cannot provide and they are trying to 'pass the torch' to a company with more resources. (that last is not really applicable here)\n \n The market self-regulates, buyers are careful and such clauses as this form in standard contracts all by themselves all the time; but you can't tell what would happen because regulation has so mutilated the scene.",

   "This post is another excellent example that the average liberal democrat will speculate and make insane accusations based on ridiculous conspiracy theories that are rational only in the mind of leftist apologists.\n\n \n Ahh the lashing out of the feeble minded who have no other means of defending their carefully constructed house of cards. I regret that I did not see this post sooner and so risk that you in turn might miss my response.\n \n \nThink about it, What motive would republicans have to insure that Greene won this primary? \n\n \n You can do this! Its less difficult than making toast. I know that took you a awhile, but you can make it all by yourself now right? \n \n Let's see, the question why would Republicans want an unknown, inexperienced candidate facing criminal charges who has no resources, both financially and logistically, to become the nominee that will oppose them in the coming election? Hmmm it's a tough one would you like to buy a vowel or do you think you can solve the puzzle? From the Wall street Journal\n \n \"His candidacy has virtually assured his popular Republican opponent, Sen. Jim DeMint, an easy victory. Mr. DeMint leads Mr. Greene by 64%-21%, according to a recent Rasmussen poll\"\n \n \"In an otherwise tough year for incumbents, Mr. DeMint has had to spend almost no time or money defending his seat, instead directing as much as $4 million from his political-action committee to help ultra-conservative candidates in Colorado, Kentucky, Florida and elsewhere. \n \n Mr. Greene also has complicated matters for other Democratic candidates in South Carolina. Gubernatorial nominee Vincent Sheheen, a telegenic state senator, has distanced himself from Mr. Greene, but the state GOP still created a website linking Mr. Sheheen with Mr. Greene, positing a \"Greene-Sheheen\" ticket. \"Sometimes the Democrats make our lives a little too easy,\" the site reads mockingly\"\n \n How about now, is it a little clearer for you?\n \n \nAnd what evidence do you have beyond your delusional imaginings that these machines could be hacked by a simple cell phone? \n\n \n And no sunshine daddy didn't call you son because you were so bright. \n \n Rage Against the Machines Voting Matters Blog\n \n Paper, Please! Voting Matters Blog\n \n And you thought it couldn't be done\n \n Researchers J. Alex Halderman from the University of Michigan, and Princeton's Ariel J. Feldman managed to open the machine, overwrite the embedded psOS+ operating system with the more pedestrian DOS, and install 'Pac-Man' -- all without leaving any evidence that the machine had been physically altered (aside from the ghosts chasing a yellow circle around the screen, that is). \n \n Electronic Voting Machine Hacked to Run 'Pac-Man'\n \n 100+ Diebold voting machines, known for how easily they can be hacked, available now on EBay | Top of the Ticket | Los Angeles Times\n \n \nNo pappi, the reality is that it is the massively stupid average democrat voter who voted for this guy just because he was in the democrat column. No other info was needed except that it was known in the predominantly African American district that he was BLACK.\n \n \n Why yes of course it so obvious why didn't I see it people are not dishonest just racist. It is far more likely that thousands of people of like colored minds saw a distinct advantage in Green and highly unlikely that just a few people, maybe even one would do something to impact elections. That I think would be a first in US History don't you agree?\n \n \nBut of course that fact would never occur to you since you are as intellectually stunted as those who voted for Greene. That's why you prefer conspiracies to the simple fact that the average democrat voter is a clear and unadulterated mental deficient.\n\n \n \n Is it more embarrassing to be shown your far less intelligent than you thought after bragging about your superiority or are you just used to this by now and will ignore this and pretend it never happened?\n \n emoticon_xgood :)",
