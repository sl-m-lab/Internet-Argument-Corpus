   "Atheism means the lack of belief in God's existence, or the belief that God does not exist: there is a difference in confidence here. Atheists are thought to be more dogmatic than mere agnostics; but everyone is an atheist about most gods.\n \n Consider the following assortment of gods; Zeus, Osiris, Woden, Kali, Asman, Llud, Huitzilopochtli..........and more, thousands more: gods for every land and clime. All of them have been believed in at some place and at some time; perhaps a few still are. But as far as Christians are concerned, these are gods that never existed. \n \n Why do Christians say these gods are 'false', or 'mythical', or non-existent? Surely for similar reasons to those given by atheists in rejecting the idea of a Christian god, or indeed any god whatsoever. \n \n The implication here is that Christians are prepared to use arguments based on evidence (or the lack of any) against the existence of pagan gods, but they oppose the same arguments if they are used to make the atheist case against a Christian god.",

St Augustine for another. My philosophy supervisor for a third.\n \n You can also argue that it is a unique line of reasoning, in that it might come from a direct experience of God's presence or him communicating with you. In such a circumstance it's quite different to the reasons others disbelieve.\n \n There is an argument here that the naturalistic explanations used by Christians against other religions can backfire, just as the attacks by Protestants on Catholic 'superstition' were turned on religion as a whole. But many Christians would claim either that other religions were imperfect understandings of God (C S Lewis again: he said that as an atheist he had to think all religions were totally wrong, but as a Christian he could appreciate a fundamental truth in nearly all of them), or that other religions were created by the Devil to decieve people (Milton). Neither of these are naturalistic",

   "If you read the Bible loosely (liberally) and believe in God, Jesus and so on, but don't take it literally and don't believe Adam and Eve were stuck in a garden with a lippy snake, then it's easy to justify Christianity as 'making sense' if you proceed to read other religion's scripture literally.\n \n If you read the Bible 'literally', then it's equally easy to justify a Christian faith. It says there is only one God, and as such anything you later read that contradicts this is wrong.\n \n I think Alan Ryan has a point. Atheists and Christians can use the same arguments to discredit Judaism, Islam etc. and some of these arguments can then in turn be levelled against Christians by atheists.\n \n Another point is that most leading scientists in the past and now are, afaik, Christian. This in turn lead to [some denominations of] Christianity being one of the quicker religions to adapt to the increase in knowledge. If you believe there is a higher power out there, then the comparitively 'advanced' nature (in terms of lack of contradictions with science) of Christianity would make Christianity seem more plausible than some other religions.\n \n Christianity is also the religion with morals very (most?) similar to Western society. If you want to 'find a religion' in terms of 'what feels right', Christianty would be the obvious option as Christianity has adapted to your societies' morals and your society has adapted to Christianity's morals.\n \n -Wez",

I don't recall Lewis using logic in choosing Christianity over any other option, but it has been a while since I've read his religious works.\nRead 'Mere Christianity'. I don't think the logic is valid, but he certainly seems to, and says that faith is about not giving up out of weakness, rather than being 'blind' or involving a 'leap'. Faith for Lewis is more like a marriage: you choose the religion on its merits, but faith stops you turning away if you have a short-term dip in actual fervor, or suffer doubt. It means you have a commitment to seriously consider the problem rather than just turning away.\n \n As for why he believed, I can paraphrase: \n 'With Jesus saying the things he said and doing the things he did we cannot call him a wise man or a teacher. Such a person would not claim Godhood or the ability to forgive sins. We must either consider him a madman, the most terrible liar in history, or fall on our knees and confess him as the living God'.\n \n If you watch (or read) closely in Narnia, he puts the same process on Lucy: 'does your sister lie? No? Does she seem mad? No? Then she must be telling the truth?\n \n It's totally invalid, for several reasons, but he thought it worked.\n \n \n \nAs I said, I'm unfamiliar with any such approach, either from the mainstream or the fringes. If you could point me at anything where someone tries this argument? It seems to me that not only could it backfire, it would be almost certain to.\nI'm only aware of it indirectly. If you read Hume on Miracles (in the Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, I think it's chapter 10), he references the work of a Protestant denying literal transubstantiation and then repeats the process on miracles generally. I would point out that both the Protestant's and Hume's logic is also flawed, but that doesn't mean it isn't attempted.",
