I thought he was anti(to the point of mental disorder)-gay?\n\n \n Directly from their website: \n (I will not link their site here, but a simple google will get you there) \n \nAugust 20, 1995 - The Night America Bombed Westboro Baptist Church With An IED (Improvised Explosive Device) In A Cowardly Move To Stop WBC's Anti-Gay Gospel Preaching - Thereby Bringing Down The Unmitigated And Irreversible Wrath Of God Upon This Evil Nation, Manifesting Itself In The Daily Bloody IED-Deaths Of American Soldiers In Iraq And Other Places.\n\n Let's clarify a little. It was a pipe bomb that caused $1691 in damage to a van and $60 damage to a fence. And it was not \"America\"...it was a solitary 25 y/o college student with an axe to grind. This seems to be only one of the many \"reasonings\" that Phelps uses to make his case. Others are that America caters to and gives special treatment to homosexuals, the military instituting the don't ask, don't tell policy...etc. \n \n Phelps thinks that any disaster that befalls the nation or even private American citizens is punishment from god for allowing homosexuals to live among us. In fact, it seems that Phelps feels that just about everyone is going to hell except him and his WBC members. (How convenient...right?). emoticon_rolleyes \n \n Notable individuals that are going to hell acoording to Phelps: \n All soldiers in the US military\n Ronald Reagan\n Reggie White\n Pope John Paul II\n Corretta Scott King\n All of the coal miners who died recently\n You...me...\n Canadians\n The Swedish\n W \n etc etc etc...\n \n It is all guilt by association...even if you yourself are anti-gay. If you serve in our military (or; live in America, Canada, Sweden, are catholic, listen to Elton John, mine coal, fight for civil rights) you support the ideals of a doomed nation that supports gays, ergo you support gays as well, and god kills these people as punishment. \n \n This man and his sheeple are disrespectful XXXXXX, nothing more.\n \n My overall guess as to why they are hitting funerals so hard is that it causes a high level of outrage, and it brings attention to them. Same reason they protested the funerals of the coal miners, and same reason they protested the 9/11 tragedy. What the majority of Americans see as tragic and sorrowful, they see as an opportunity.

   "You may not be as hate-filled as Phelps. But many who are not as hate filled as Phelps still do not support equality under the law for gay couples. That is Matthew's wish, and if you do not support that then you are a hinderance to what he feels is right and just, regardless of how you feel about him as a person.\n \n It's like saying \"I like blue-eyed children just fine, but we need to save money so we aren't going to feed them this week.\" I am not trying to draw a comparison between forced starvation and legal rights for couples here - but rather trying to elaborate that \"how you feel\" about a thing does not mean squat if you are supporting action that can harm.\n\n \n \n Exactly and more Eloquently put then how I said it. emoticon_xgood",

   "Well then If you are different you then support same sex marriage equal rights for gays and non discrimination legislation, and hate crimes legislation?\n \n See if you are different then Phelps then you would support us. If someone does not support these items they might just as well be phelps because either way gays are screwed, no pun intended. What is the difference between someone that hates you and someone who disaproves of you? Either way it gets us no where.\n\n \n Like I said in my last post...do you believe that stealing is wrong? If you do then you must be just like Phelps. You think in extremes...only two types of people; I find that a sad and simple way to look at life.",

I guess there is no difference in people that believe stealing is wrong...they all must think the same. For you to see that if someone thinks gays should no marry or whatever then they have to adopt all of Phelps views then that is just the dumbest view I can think of. Why doesn't Phelps have to adopt mine? If you want to group us all into \"people that don't support everything you want\" then there are a lot of people with me and so be it.",

From my point of view those who disaprove of gay rights will do nothing to help advance gay rights. Those who hate gay people will do nothing to advance gay rights. So I ask you if you were a gay man would you see a difference? I can see the difference between disaproval and hate but neither one does anything to advance gay rights.
