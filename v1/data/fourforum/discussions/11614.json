   "Hi everyone it's been well over a couple of months since my last post and I have been busy. I was given an honorable discharge from the navy and am now attending college as a music major and lead tenor sax in the jazz ensemble and lead baritone sax in the wind ensemble. I'm actually living my goals and dreams!\n \n I found a job and am living an almost normal life outside of the issues I have come here to seek answers to. from you guys. First off I'm gay in case you didnt know and I',m part of a very christian family. I have been dragged off to church several times already where the pastor has kept on and on about the evil of gays and voting yes on prop 8 (california proposition on bannig gay marriage) and to the point to where they sell T-shirts about the proposition to raise money towards it. \n \n Then comes my family. My sister who is not very christian and is like any normal rebellious teen trusts me and loves me the same but I'm afraid she may shy away from me if I tell her.\n \n My mom is very christian and I think it might break her heart if she knew. My father being a very religious person I fear will even kick me out of the house once he knows cause i guess he'd rather have his soul than his son.\n \n My point is that I'm sick of hiding and I can't keep pretending. Ive already came out to 3 of my closest friends and their totally fine and support me. So what am I supposed to do about my family and how should I approach it. Because it's getting to the point to where when they make an anti gay comment or something I get very defensive and upset and they notice and I'm afriad I may just blurt it out.\n \n Any help would be very nice. Thanks guys.",

   "Tell them, or write to them in a letter if you don't live at home anymore. But however you do it confess that what you're about to share is the scariest thing you've ever had to confess to them, but because you know that your relationship is founded in the love that God has for us through Christ, that you know they wont judge or condemn you for something you have no emotional control over. \n \n Explain to them that you understand that we are all sinners in Gods sight and that Jesus died for all of us. So you're not seeking their approval, but just for their love, their understanding, and their acceptance of you during this difficult time of accepting who you are. Assure them that you're the same person you have always been, and that the only reason sharing this part of your life with them is so difficult is because you love them so much and you value their approval and acceptance like any other kid does his parents. \n \n And that more than anything you need to know that they still love you as you aren't choosing to do anything to hurt them. Say I've always wanted you to be proud of me and I'm so afraid that this will change your opinion of me. But then I think of the Lords love and forgiveness for us as sinners, and it seems impossible to me that you would hold me to a higher standard of perfection than anyone else. So please accept me as I am and most of all, help me accept myself for who I am as i am struggling in ways that you could never relate to. I need to know that you can still love me mom and dad. Only because I love you both so much. Your son...\n \n If you could write this to them in a letter, it might allow them to read it in private together, and digest it, and talk about it together before facing you with it. I would really suggest that route. Maybe you could invite them to dinner at a nice restaurant, get them seated, excuse yourself, give the Host the letter to deliver to them after they eat with your apologies that you were called away unexpectedly, and leave your CC# with the host to pay the bill with a 20% tip added in, and then slip away. \n \n They would have a nice dinner, read the letter afterwards and be able to discuss it over an after dinner drink. But I don't know your parents, so this is just an idea.",

   "My opinion? Don't worry about your teen sister. I don't know her personally, but every teenager I know (especially girls) are completely accepting of gays. This is the 21st century, and being gay is completely normal. Most people accept that. And if you're gay, then you're gay. There's nothing you can do to hide or change that, its just who you are. I would also find a more accepting and open minded church than the one you currently attend. I found a very nice Episcopalian church for awhile that was very intelligent, and accepted gays and gay marriage.\n \n There are plenty of gay people now days. I have gay uncles, cousins, and plenty of gay friends. Not a very big deal in my mind. I wouldn't hide who you are from your family.",

One who has not done this sometimes cannot imagine how hard it is. \n \n What seems to be a common occurrence is that is often goes much better than feared. I'd take her advice, though, and hold off on the parents just yet. In any event, you should come out when it makes sense for you - when being closeted is more painful than not - and do it on your terms. Certainly be sensitive to how hard this is on others, especially family and friends you love. But on balance, taking a risk of losing someone occasionally is a tough choice that we make.\n \n I am really stinking lucky in this regard. I have never lost anyone in my life that I actually cared about by coming out. A few XXXXXXXXs are gone, but no great loss. Not everyone is this fortunate, so I totally understand why it occassionally makes sense to stay closeted. On the other hand, I have NEVER known anyone who, after the dust settles, is not much happier and relieved by coming out. \n \n Good luck.",

   "Jason, in my christian religeon God says when a man sleeps with another man, as a man would sleep with a woman, it is an abomination before God. But we are also told to not hate the person, but instead we are to love the person, but not his sin. God says homosexuality is a sin, but God also says that we are not to judge others, because if we judge people like yourself, then God will in turn judge us.

   "Jason,\n I haven't been reading to much of these debates of gay rights lately but yours caught my attention. \n Look, my mother is religious and shoved me out of the closet at the age of sixteen. She was searching my car and personal belongings and found an innocent letter I wrote to another boy. \n She railed against me for months and even years. She even went so far as to tell me, \"when I'm 6 feet under, I want you to have no doubt that you put me there\". This was early on. She struggled for a very long time. But I had to recognize that this was her struggle, not mine. I would be there for her, to ansewr any questions but this was her's to come to terms with. \n She feared embarrassment from her family and wonderd how I would be judged by her god. \n I am who I am. That is the consistent message I stuck to. You can't let your anyone, family or not, disenfranchise you from being who you are. \n Your life and happiess depends on it. \n \n What I did do, was mix in some educating literature with her books. \n She never mentioned the books, she didn't throw them back at me, I actually found one hidden away next to her bed with a bookmark. This was wonderful for me. It told me that she was actually trying. She was seeking education. \n \n Skip ahead a few years. She came to me and apologized for \"ignorance\". \n She admited she just didn't know what it meant to be gay in our schools and society at large, and cried uncontrolable for adding to the suffering I must have already been going through. She said she could never forgive herself. \n \n Today, she has reconciled her faith with her son (me) and doesn't hesitate to point out injustice where she sees it. Here in Ohio, one of my proudest moments was when I saw her planting the \"vote no\" sign against the anti-gay marriage admendment in her front yard. It still passed, but that meant so much.\n Your Mom, your Dad, your Sister can change. You can not. \n Be strong, do not ever let anyone stop you from being you. Don't be stifled, be proud and happy. You are not the problem here, it's the product of a flood of anti-gay propaganda from \"so-called christians and other faiths\" and just the uneducated person next door that's part of the problem. \n \n They will come around, for you, just stay you. \n I wish you all the happiest for your wonderful life ahead of you.
