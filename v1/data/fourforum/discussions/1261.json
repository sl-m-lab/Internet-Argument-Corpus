   "The whole text is:\n \n \"It has been several times truly remarked that bills of rights are, in\n their origin, stipulations between kings and their subjects,\n abridgements of prerogative in favor of privilege, reservations of\n rights not surrendered to the prince. Such was MAGNA CHARTA, obtained by\n the barons, sword in hand, from King John. Such were the subsequent\n confirmations of that charter by succeeding princes. Such was the\n Petition of Right assented to by Charles I., in the beginning of his\n reign. Such, also, was the Declaration of Right presented by the Lords\n and Commons to the Prince of Orange in 1688, and afterwards thrown into\n the form of an act of parliament called the Bill of Rights. It is\n evident, therefore, that, according to their primitive signification,\n they have no application to constitutions professedly founded upon the\n power of the people, and executed by their immediate representatives and\n servants. Here, in strictness, the people surrender nothing; and as they\n retain every thing they have no need of particular reservations. \"WE,\n THE PEOPLE of the United States, to secure the blessings of liberty to\n ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution\n for the United States of America.\" Here is a better recognition of\n popular rights, than volumes of those aphorisms which make the principal\n figure in several of our State bills of rights, and which would sound\n much better in a treatise of ethics than in a constitution of\n government.\"\n \n \n James Madison is saying that the text you quote is a misconception. He is using it to start his arguement not as proof for yours. He is saying exactly the same thing I did. That THE PEOPLE empowered themselves.\n \n \n He begginning of his argument to refute YOUR argument starts with: Here, in strictness, the people surrender nothing\n You confuse me. It's Alexander Hamilton who's speaking, not Madison. He's saying that a Bill of Rights is not necessary. I was just trying to point out the historical origins of the American Bill of Rights and I don't see how this text refutes that.",

If the Founders had meant to say, ?Congress shall make no law impairing the right of each state to maintain such well regulated militia as it may deem necessary to its security as a free state,\" then they would have said so.\n \n \n \n \n Furthermore, these 'natural rights' are being interpreted by the Courts so therefore the court is defining the scope of 'natural rights' not nature!\n\n \n That is an interesting discussion. Your point about 1939 and the private owernship of guns is moot. It is not the holding in the case. The holding is weather a person can own a sawed-off shotgun and nothing else. The holding decides the law. The holding did not decide the issue of private ownership of firearms. As shown that after the holding was enforced, private ownership of firearms still exists in the USA after 1939. The discussion regarding the militia in 1939 has no bearing on law, it is not the holding.\n \n As you have also shown every citizen above age 17 is in the militia. Thus every person in the USA and a citizen has a right to firearms.",

The holding is weather a person can own a sawed-off shotgun and nothing else. \n\n The courts have certainly disagreed with you about that. \n \"Appellant, Peter B. Thomas, argues that the City of Portland, Maine, and various city officials infringed his constitutional rights by denying him a permit to carry a concealed handgun. Established case law makes clear that the federal Constitution grants appellant no right to carry a concealed handgun. See, e.g., United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 178, 59 S.Ct. 816, 818, 83 L.Ed. 1206 (1939) (second amendment applies only to weapons that have a 'reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.');\"\n (Thomas v. Members of City Council of Portland)\n http://www.healylaw.com/cases/thomas2.htm\n \n \"This appeal concerns the constitutionality of the Village of Morton Grove's Ordinance No. 81-11,[fn1] which prohibits the possession of handguns within the Village's borders. The district court held that the Ordinance was constitutional. We affirm....The second amendment provides that 'A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.' U.S. Const. amend. II. Construing this language according to its plain meaning, it seems clear that the right to bear arms is inextricably connected to the preservation of a militia. This is precisely the manner in which the Supreme Court interpreted the second amendment in United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 59 S.Ct. 816, 83 L.Ed. 1206 (1939), the only Supreme Court case specifically addressing that amendment's scope. There the Court held that the right to keep and bear arms extends only to those arms which are necessary to maintain a well regulated militia....Under the controlling authority of Miller we conclude that the right to keep and bear handguns is not guaranteed by the second amendment.[fn9]\" Quilici v. Village of Morton Grove, 695 F.2d 261 (7th Cir. 1982)http://www.healylaw.com/cases/quilici.htm\n \n So the ruling in US v.

   "Further 'arms' is seen as guns. In the 1800s the US courts ruled that the right to carry a concealed knife was not protected because it was understood that the right to bear arms relates not to personal security, but the protection of the citizen from the state - taking away rights.\n Many US gun-owners talk about the 'protection' they feel with guns - and there's a big debate over the crime rate - all of which is ignoring that the right to bear arms is not about personal protection.\n\n The second amendment does not start with...\n \"Gun ownership being important for personal protection....\"\n nor does it start with\n \"Hunting being an important part of feeding one's family....\"\n but it does start with\n \"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state....\"\n \n think about it",

   "Kelvin. I have already stated these court cases. But I will repeat myself (it's a bit long... the cases are at the end).\n \n Originally posted on : How do you defend yourself? Post 29\n \n Effectively your argument is that; the right to carry arms is a natural right, although you've no proof of what is a 'natural right'. Nor have you shown that this right has always existed... just that the founding fathers believed that these rights always existed... but then they would because they were trying to legitimate armed rebellion. Their rationale was they were rebelling against a legitimate authority, by stating that there was some higher authority which the state itself was in conflict with - rather a simple, but novel argument - and therefore they were just rebelling to restore this over-arching authority.\n \n Natural rights don't exist at all. How does a right 'just exist' ie. naturally?\n http://www.spectacle.org/0400/natural.html\n \n However, I don't expect you'll agree to that tract. So let's look at what you said.\n \n Firstly the Ninth Amendment is superfluous to your argument. You are trying to state that some rights have existed 'naturally' and the Constitution only vocalises some of them. But, what of these...? What are these natural rights that are not mentioned? Do the courts enunciate what they are?\n \n You said... \n Quote: \n Originally Posted by Rev. HellBound\n The rights in the Constitution recognize SOME of the rights of freemen. \n \n A-hem. Some freemen. It is not an absolute right. It never was. I asked you where do we find this 'natural right' to carry weapons? US laws somewhat stems from British laws; where did this right exist before it was mentioned in the Constitution? Or, did it just exist in man's hearts?\n \n Your web-site further claims \" The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government. This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted, which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution.\"\n http://www.constitution.org/leglrkba.htm\n \n So, it at least is trying to say that this 'right' has existed in long-established principles in English common law! And, then, where might they be expressed? (Or are they just too suggesting it existed in the ether)\n \n What about?\n The U.K. Bill of Rights (1689)\n That the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defence suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law. It is not a 'natural' right. It is a legislated right.\n \n So, it's not all freemen, just some. Actually it was also in practice on propertied Protestants too! So much for being a universal, therefore natural right!\n \n Well, if you believe that this is a 'natural right' it only applies to non-Catholics, and is conditional by the law. Hardly a 'natural right'. Further, hardly a long-established principle. One web-site suggests also the Magna Carta of 1215, but as this in principle again only was related to the rights of Churchmen and nobles, it suggests to that you don't have this as a precedent of a 'long-established principle of English law' guaranteeing the rights of all freemen.\n \n You need too to understand that they (the English in 1688) had also ejected a legitimate government out - not over taxes, but because James II Stuart had a Catholic heir. By usurping traditional power they had to appeal to a higher authority.\n \n Either it has and has never been set down before the American revolution, or, it has. If the later, then where is it. If the former, then what proof do you have that this 'natural right' has always existed?\n \n Therefore as far as a 'natural right' existing, the right to bear arms doesn't seem very natural! It never applied to all freemen.\n \n Until you can prove that this right to bear arms is 'natural'... then I must look at how the 'right' has been enacted.\n \n How have Americans viewed this right and law?\n  Houston v. Moore 1820 \n \"[The immediate issue in this case was federal and state jurisdiction to try non-compliance with militia orders. The context provides much enlightenment on the militia institution. Militia duty was conscript duty. Militiamen were governed by the rules and articles of war. The Militia Acts were the precursors of the selective service acts of the twentieth century. There was NO mention of a \"personal right\" to be armed outside of lawful authority. Houston v. Moore is provided here for further enlightenment to interested parties as Appendix W to US v. Emerson. It was not included in the appendices provided to the Fifth Circuit.] \"\n http://www.potowmack.org/houst1.html\n \n Martin v. Mott, 1827\n \"[The issue in this case was federal and state authority and jurisdiction over the militia. As in Houston v. Moore, the context provides much enlightenment on the militia institution. Militia duty was conscript duty. Militiamen were governed by the rules and articles of war. The Militia Acts were the precursors of the selective service acts of the twentieth century. There was NO mention of a \"personal right\" to be armed outside of lawful authority. Martin v. Mott and Houston v. Moore are provided for further enlightenment to interested parties as Appendices to US v. Emerson. These were not included in the appendices provided to the Fifth Circuit.] \"\n http://www.potowmack.org/martmott.htm\n \n AYMETTE v. THE STATE (1840)\n \"When, therefore, (the British) Parliament says that \"subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defence, suitable to their condition, as allowed by law,\" it does not mean for private defence, but, being armed, they may as a body rise up to defend their just rights, and compel their rulers to respect the laws. This declaration of right is made in reference to the fact before complained of, that the people had been disarmed, and soldiers had been quartered among them contrary to law. The complaint was against the government. The grievances to which they were thus forced to submit were for the most part of a public character, and could have been redressed only by the people rising up for their common defence, to vindicate their rights.\"\n The section under consideration, in our bill of rights, was adopted in reference to these historical facts, and in this point\n of view its language is most appropriate and expressive. Its words are, \"the free white men of this state have a right to keep and\n bear arms for their common defence.\"\n and\n \"hey need not, for such a purpose, the use of those weapons which are usually employed in private broils, and which are efficient only in the hands of the robber and the assassin. These weapons would be useless in war. \"\n http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu....tte_v_state.txt\n \n At best this means you better hand in your glock! Notice the words 'as allowed by law' hardly shows a long standing principle of a natural right - unless you argue that it's always been infringed upon... and why not? We can't have every loony carrying guns around, if we did, gun related homicides would sky-rocket. Ooops, that's what's happening in America isn't it!\n \n This interpretation of a 'natural right' suggests you don't need a gun for your own safety, as you seem to believe.\n \n So, the state has always legislated and defined this right. That's what states are for - a referee or umpire to settle disputes in law. Further for the good of the people, the people have handed power over to the state. You might want to read Hobbes on this.",

Fresh in their minds was the memory of the British violation of civil rights before and during the Revolution. They demanded a \"bill of rights\" that would spell out the immunities of individual citizens. Several state conventions in their formal ratification of the Constitution asked for such amendments; others ratified the Constitution with the understanding that the amendments would be offered.\"\n http://www.billofrights.com/HistoryoftheBillofRights.htm\n \n \"The Convention had decided that the Constitution would take effect upon ratification by conventions in nine of the 13 states. By June 1788 the required nine states ratified the Constitution, but the large states of Virginia and New York had not. \n Most people felt that without the support of these two states, the Constitution would never be honored. \n  To many, the document seemed full of dangers: would not the strong central government that it established tyrannize them, oppress them with heavy taxes and drag them into wars? \"\n http://odur.let.rug.nl/~usa/H/1994/ch4_p6.htm\n \n \" The absence of a \"bill of rights\" turned out to be an obstacle to the Constitution's ratification by the states. It would take four more years of intense debate before the new government's form would be resolved. The Federalists opposed including a bill of rights on the ground that it was unnecessary. The Anti-Federalists, who were afraid of a strong centralized government, refused to support the Constitution without one. \"\n http://archive.aclu.org/library/pbp9.html\n \n \"The Constitution was signed in September 1787 and sent to the Congress. Eleven days later, it was submitted to the states for ratification. But as the people began to examine the document, they came to share the sentiments of those who advocated that the Constitution include a set of specific guarantees among them, the right to free speech, freedom of religion, due process of law and freedom from governmental search and seizure. The people ratified the Constitution only after its framers pledged to add to it such protections. Congress added those protections in 1789, and in 1791 twothirds of the states ratified the first ten amendments to the Constitution, which became known as the Bill of Rights.\"\n http://www.aclu-mass.org/issuebriefs/histbillrgts.html\n \n \n As I said, you are an American.

   "\n The Bill of Rights came about because your own country wanted a lot of power - to protect the citizen from it becoming a tyranny you can form a militia - to protect your state against the national government.\n Very true. The second amendment itself says it was written to ensure the \"security of a free state,\" Arms that don't contribute to such a purpose are not protected by the second amendment. The guns you own for hunting, recreation, or personal defense against criminals are not protected by the second amendment. The second amendment was written not to protect people against criminals. It was written to protect people against the federal government. The Constitution in Article 1 Section 8 explains- \"The Congress shall have Power To.... \n To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress;\" People were fearful that the Constitution gave the federal government too much power over the militia and so the second amendment was added. \n \n Let's go back to Amyette v. State (1840). It concerned a person who carried a knife around with him for personal protection. The court explained that \"it does not mean for private defence, but, being armed, they may as a body rise up to defend their just rights, and compel their rulers to respect the laws.\"\n Notice the words \"as a body\". It's not a right that you exercise by yourself. It's a right that is exercised with others (more specifically with others in the militia). In that sense it's a collective right. The court also explained the meaning of the term \"bear arms\"\n \"Here we know that the phrase has a military sense, and no other; and we must infer that it is used in the same sense in the 26th section,\n which secures to the citizen the right to bear arms. A man in the\n pursuit of deer, elk, and buffaloes might carry his rifle every day\n for forty years, and yet it would never be said of him that he had\n borne arms; much less could it be said that a private citizen bears\n arms because he has a dirk or pistol concealed under his clothes,\n or a spear in a cane.\" \n \"Bearing arms\" does not mean carrying a gun around for personal protection against criminals or using a gun for hunting. Bearing arms \"has a military sense, and no other\"\n \n This becomes more evident if you examine the first draft of the Second Amendment- \"The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country; but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.\"",

   "You complain about a 1994 law that made \"good citizens\" wait for their guns. This was the Brady Law. Yet in another thread you speak highly of the Brady Law because it was democratically made. \n \n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=1205&page=4\n\n \n It is called tollerance. It is not an individual requirement in a democracy, but without it there is no democracy. Too bad so very few people who are anti-gunners can practice tollerance.\n \n Please do not put such word in my mouth. You are almost implying that I approve of Brady law. I do not. I only approve of instant background checks and nothing else about Brady. The ONLY good thing about Brady is the instant background check and nothing else. Funny thing about Brady. The last bill before Congres which increased law enforcement budgets also had more gun control legislation with it. Of course Brady supported it. NRA said no. No to the bill because of more gun control. \n Not no to more law enforcement budget. That is typical of Brady trickery. Of course Brady milked as the NRA helping criminals and not helping police. The NRA is for increased law enforcement spending. Not increased law enforcement spending AND gun control on the same bill.\n \n BTW in the other thread? Can you help point out which NRA policy is racist? and why?",

   "The NRA is for increased law enforcement spending.\n\n Yeah right. If only the NRA would do more than pay lip service to the idea enforcing gun control laws. Who is in charge of enforcing federal gun laws? The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (the ATF). Who has been the number one enemy of the ATF over the years? The NRA. In the 1980's the NRA tried to convince President Reagan to abolish the ATF. In more recent years that have lobbied congress to decrease the budget of the ATF. \n \n \" 'The National Rifle Association, every year, is before the appropriations committees on Capitol Hill advocating that ATF's budget be cut.

If the government approves of the request, that approval \n grants you the same rights as any other citizen. So, the government has the right to not approve a request for citizenship. Again, I seen nothing but a semantic debate that is meaningless in this context. As the government can choose to do or not do something, it's no different than the government having the right to choose something and the authority to impose their decision. Whatever words are used here, it's just a meaningless semantic debate about which word you choose to use.\n \n 2) The remainder of your argument picks apart a sentence and uses words out of context, and doesn't even mention the most important part of what the object of that sentence is!\n \n The sentence refers to a militia.\n \n The entire sentence essentially says that the government will permit people to posses arms, for the purpose of forming a militia.\n \n That seems to be a pont you kinda overlooked.\n \n As it happens, we've got a militia already, and the government has not prevented keeping the weapons for our militia.\n \n However, you are a private citizen. And the government would be happy for you to bear arms in our militia in Iraq.\n \n Unfortunately, by yourself, you are nothing but an individual. And the 2nd Amendment does not apply to a militia of 1 person. \n \n The Supreme Court refused to debate that case when it was brought to them a few weeks ago.\n \n In the case, the lawyers were going to argue that an organization should be permitted to bear arms (i.e. own guns), but a private citizen is not entiled to do so under the 2nd Amendment, as 1 person is not a militia, but an organization of people can be considered to be a militia.\n \n Rather than read a sentence 2 or 3 words at a time, and loose the entire meaning of it, or omit the reason for the sentence entirely, it would make more sense to discuss what is being said in an entie phrase, rather than as you did.",

Namely, the definition of a militia at the time that the Constitution was written. Again, I didn't and don't disagree with that definition as it applies to that time, nor what was in the minds of the Founding Fathers.\n \n I would point out that if we choose to interpret everything in a document that is several hundred or several thousand years old, quite literally, that the Constitution and a few other well known documents would not make much sense in our lives today.\n \n Yes, at the time, I am sure, as you posted, that Men were expected to bring their own rifles.\n \n Thankfully, today, you do not have to bring your own tank, nor RPG's, Stingers, rifles, or anything else.\n \n And THAT is an important point to remember, when we look at the Constitution. We do not expect and do NOT EVEN PERMIT Men to bring their own weapons into the militia that is formed, in peacetime or wartime.\n \n The ORGANIZATION (the collective i.e. militia) provides weapons for Men.\n \n So, sure when the Constitution was written, I PERSONALLY believe that when the Founding Fathers put in the 2nd Amendment, that they most likely felt there was absolutely no need to EXPLICITLY say \"Private Citizens\" shall have the right to keep arms, BECAUSE EVERYONE HAD A GUN! LOL!\n \n I do NOT disagree with that aspect of the 2nd Amendment argument. Also, I should point out AGAIN, that the Supreme Court (A FEW WEEKS AGO) REFUSED to hear the case about the 2nd Amendment, and the right of an Organization (if you prefer: the POWER of an Organization) to own guns, but not for individuals.\n ----------\n So, let's get down to brass tacks...\n \n If you choose to interpret the Constitution as written, and what the Founding Fathers hadi in mind, when they wrote the 2nd Amendment EXACTLY THAT WAY... then I would say \"Yes\" there is NO question that the Founding Fathers would have expected every home to have a gun, and that individuals should own guns. (There were people hunted for a real reason back then.)\n I think it would be silly to argue differently. HOWEVER...\n \n HOWEVER... If you believe that the Constitution is A LIVING DOCUMENT... as many judges and laymen do, and I personally think that is what understanding the Constitution IS AND SHOULD BE all about, then you CAN CERTAINLY interpret the Constitution as CLEARLY indicating that the Right to Bear Arms was given for the purpose of a militia, and that COLLECTIVES \n (i.e. Organizations) should have the right to keep Guns, and with few exceptions, no individual. \n \n Recall that the Founders did specify a purpose for the Individual being able to bear Arms, and THAT PURPOSE was for a militia. HOWEVER, TODAY there is NO SUCH purpose.\n ===============\n So, THE ENTIRE DEBATE REALLY comes down to this...\n \n Should the Constitution be understood exactly as written, and with exactly what the Founding Fathers had in mind, \n \n OR\n \n Should the Constitution be understood as written during a point in time in history, and for it to maintain its value and application, it needs to be interpreted as a \"Living Document\" with the situations and conditions we face today, in mind.\n \n The two approaches are quite different, and there MAY BE reasons that I am unaware of (as a layman) that are ALREADY SPECIFIED, in which approach 1 or approach 2 must be used (by law).\n \n I'm not a Constitutional Lawyer, so I have to make up my own mind how I think the Constitution should be read, and I suspect you do as well.\n \n In this case, and I suspect that in very many cases, I would say that approach 2 is required, BUT THERE IS A PROBLEM ...\n \n I RECOGNIZE ... that if all legal gun owners were forced to turn in thier guns, that only the police and criminals would have guns.\n \n THAT PRESENTS A BIG PROBLEM FOR ME.... as I do own a Shotgun, and a Handgun for Home Protection purposes. I have also spent over 180 hours reading a number of books by lawyers, and other professionals that understand much about using guns and the various interpretations, of the diverse State laws that are applied, when using a gun for self-defense. And I've spent over 40 hours on just studying that part of my own State's laws on using a gun for that purpose. \n \n And I've been trained by a former cop, with the shotgun, and by a person that competes in various gun tournaments with my handgun, and about 6 or 7 other types of handguns.\n \n And in a year's time, I've fired 3000 rounds of ammo, for practice.\n \n Does everyone do any of this? Hardly. Does it bother me. You bet!\n \n So, until the State says I've gotta turn over my registered guns, I'm gonna keep em. Carefully!\n \n BTW. The KKK is No voice of reason. They are a hate organization that has lynched African Americans for just the fun of it, and aside from their general philosophy of White Supremacy, they are SUPREMELY stupid, and ignorant pathetic excuses for White people everywhere!!!\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n with exactly what the Founding Fathers had in mind,",

We do not expect and do NOT EVEN PERMIT Men to bring their own weapons into the militia that is formed, in peacetime or wartime.\n \n The ORGANIZATION (the collective i.e. militia) provides weapons for Men.\n \n So, sure when the Constitution was written, I PERSONALLY believe that when the Founding Fathers put in the 2nd Amendment, that they most likely felt there was absolutely no need to EXPLICITLY say \"Private Citizens\" shall have the right to keep arms, BECAUSE EVERYONE HAD A GUN! LOL!\n \n I do NOT disagree with that aspect of the 2nd Amendment argument. Also, I should point out AGAIN, that the Supreme Court (A FEW WEEKS AGO) REFUSED to hear the case about the 2nd Amendment, and the right of an Organization (if you prefer: the POWER of an Organization) to own guns, but not for individuals.\n ----------\n So, let's get down to brass tacks...\n \n If you choose to interpret the Constitution as written, and what the Founding Fathers hadi in mind, when they wrote the 2nd Amendment EXACTLY THAT WAY... then I would say \"Yes\" there is NO question that the Founding Fathers would have expected every home to have a gun, and that individuals should own guns. (There were people hunted for a real reason back then.)\n I think it would be silly to argue differently. HOWEVER...\n \n HOWEVER... If you believe that the Constitution is A LIVING DOCUMENT... as many judges and laymen do, and I personally think that is what understanding the Constitution IS AND SHOULD BE all about, then you CAN CERTAINLY interpret the Constitution as CLEARLY indicating that the Right to Bear Arms was given for the purpose of a militia, and that COLLECTIVES \n (i.e. Organizations) should have the right to keep Guns, and with few exceptions, no individual. \n \n Recall that the Founders did specify a purpose for the Individual being able to bear Arms, and THAT PURPOSE was for a militia. HOWEVER, TODAY there is NO SUCH purpose.\n ===============\n So, THE ENTIRE DEBATE REALLY comes down to this...\n \n Should the Constitution be understood exactly as written, and with exactly what the Founding Fathers had in mind, \n \n OR\n \n Should the Constitution be understood as written during a point in time in history, and for it to maintain its value and application, it needs to be interpreted as a \"Living Document\" with the situations and conditions we face today, in mind.\n \n The two approaches are quite different, and there MAY BE reasons that I am unaware of (as a layman) that are ALREADY SPECIFIED, in which approach 1 or approach 2 must be used (by law).\n \n I'm not a Constitutional Lawyer, so I have to make up my own mind how I think the Constitution should be read, and I suspect you do as well.\n \n In this case, and I suspect that in very many cases, I would say that approach 2 is required, BUT THERE IS A PROBLEM ...\n \n I RECOGNIZE ... that if all legal gun owners were forced to turn in thier guns, that only the police and criminals would have guns.\n \n THAT PRESENTS A BIG PROBLEM FOR ME.... as I do own a Shotgun, and a Handgun for Home Protection purposes. I have also spent over 180 hours reading a number of books by lawyers, and other professionals that understand much about using guns and the various interpretations, of the diverse State laws that are applied, when using a gun for self-defense. And I've spent over 40 hours on just studying that part of my own State's laws on using a gun for that purpose. \n \n And I've been trained by a former cop, with the shotgun, and by a person that competes in various gun tournaments with my handgun, and about 6 or 7 other types of handguns.\n \n And in a year's time, I've fired 3000 rounds of ammo, for practice.\n \n Does everyone do any of this? Hardly. Does it bother me. You bet!\n \n So, until the State says I've gotta turn over my registered guns, I'm gonna keep em. Carefully!\n \n BTW. The KKK is No voice of reason. They are a hate organization that has lynched African Americans for just the fun of it, and aside from their general philosophy of White Supremacy, they are SUPREMELY stupid, and ignorant pathetic excuses for White people everywhere!!!\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n with exactly what the Founding Fathers had in mind,\n\n \n A standing army provides weapons for the men. A militia can, ours does not. Every citizen above the age of 17 in the USA is in the miltia. You don't have a choice. On your 18 birthday in the USA, you become a member of the miltia. As a militia member, I can own guns.\n \n According to your training you are now a menace and danger to society according to anti-gunners. \n \n For anyone who believes that the NRA is racist, please see last monts issue of American Rifleman. Two women are highligted as historical figures who used firearms, both ex-slaves.",

Gun Owners need to know the laws, they need to proove that they can hit paper at some reasonable distance, say 15 yards, say 18 out of 20 times, and they need to be trained, and retested every few years to make sure that they can still hit paper and are not gonna be shooting wildly out of one of their windows, instead of at the immenent deadly threat.\n \n What I am saying is to give legal gun owners a chance at knowing their rights, so they don't end up in jail because the THOUGHT this or that, and they need to protect society from legal gun owners by making sure that we are properly trained and tested. That;s my beef with the gun laws.\n \n I'm telling you folks, read at least the first 3 of those books I posted up for you in the other thread in this forum, because you have no idea how stacked up AGAINST THE LEGAL GUN OWNER, the State Laws are.

   "I think some people take certain words out of context in the second amendment and then they apply their own modern day definitions to words that historically had quite different meanings. Remember that the second amendment starts off with \"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state....\"\n Even without this preamble the second amendment would still only protect a right in connection with militia service. Michael C. Dorf, professor of law at at Columbia University, explains the meaning of the phrase \"keep and bear arms\". \n \n \"Moreover, if one reads Founding Era documents, one finds that the phrase 'bear arms' was almost always used to refer to military service. (The interested reader can try this himself or herself by searching for the phrase 'bear arms' in the Library of Congress's database of congressional and other documents from the founding era.).... \n \n At the Founding, 'keep and bear' appears to have been understood as a unitary phrase, like other constitutional terms such as 'cruel and unusual' or 'necessary and proper.' In my own research, I have not come across any documents of the Founding period that treat 'keep' as adding a right to private possession distinct from the military notion of arms-bearing.\" \n http://www.cnn.com/2001/LAW/11/columns/fl.dorf.2nd.amendment.11.01/\n\n \n I hate it when people quote the whole message, but I am going to anway because I think you present some important argument here and I want to make certain that those who see the reply catch the context of the argument.\n \n First off, in Jeffersons papers, as collected at the library of congress, the smitsonian, and other institutions, he uses the term \"Bear Arms\" a total of 347 times. Of those, only 54 refer to any type of miliatry service, military units, or government service. The remainder refer entirely to individuals. If you look at the commentaries of the constitution at the time, including papers written by the original signers, you will find that the second amendment is discussed in great length by the majority of those people, and in every single case, it is referred to as an individual right, unlimited in scope.\n \n Examples of some qoutes from the founders:\n \n No freeman shall ever be debarred the use of arms. \n ---Thomas Jefferson: Draft Virginia Constitution, 1776. \n [The Constitution preserves] the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation...(where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.\n ---James Madison\n Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any pretence, raised in the United States. A military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power, and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination, to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive. \n ---Noah Webster, An Examination of the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (Philadelphia 1787). \n [W]hereas, to preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them; nor does it follow from this, that all promiscuously must go into actual service on every occasion. The mind that aims at a select militia, must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle; and when we see many men disposed to practice upon it, whenever they can prevail, no wonder true republicans are for carefully guarding against it. \n ---Richard Henry Lee, The Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788. \n [T]he people are not to be disarmed of their weapons. They are left in full possession of them\n ---Zacharia Johnson\n \n \n Every single man who signed the constitution maintained a personal arsenal. Over half of those who signed the constitution had CANNONS in their arsenal. \n \n The argument about applying modern speach standards to the second Amendment does bring some interesting points, though. The biggest one is, Does the phrase \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State\", mean anything at all? Review of other historical documents at the time, including text books, suggests that it may not be at all central to the right conveyed in the amendment. \n \n This was a writing technique taught and used during the period. There was an introductory clause, then a purpose clause. Many state constitutions contain such wording (will give an example in a second). The purpose clause was NOT to be dependant on the introductory clause. Here is an example from the Rhode Island constitution:\n \n //quote//\n The liberty of the press being essential to the security of freedom in a state, any person may publish sentiments on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty \n //end quote//\n \n To interpet the above quote the same way the \"collective right\" proponents interpet the second, you would be forced to find that \"any person may publish sentiments on any subject\" only insofar as it relates to items which are \"essential to the security of freedom in a state\". Thus, publishing of items NOT directly \"essential to the security of freedom in a state\" could be prohibited. Fictional novels, recipe books and non-fiction books which did not meet the criteria of \"essential to the security of freedom in a state\" could all be outlawed.\n \n Every constitution from the original 13 states carries clauses worded like this. Every publication (newspapers, circulars, etc..), technical writing, and legal commentary recoverd from the time period carried phrases worded in such a manner. It is not unreasonable to assume that the Second Amendment should be interpeted in the same manner as other writings of the time which are identically formed. \n \n Now, I am going to jump around just a bit. Somebody in a previous post made reference to \"a militia of one\" There is no such thing. The militia is comprised of EVERY american who is physically able to serve between the ages of 17 and 45.\n \n Here is the current militia act:\n //quote//\n \n (a) The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and . . . under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard.\n \n \n (b) The classes of the militia are -- \n \n \n (1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and\n \n \n (2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia. \n \n //end quote//\n \n \n Here is the militia act of 1792:\n \n //quote//\n Sec. 1. Be it enacted . . . That each and every free able-bodied white male citizen of the respective states, resident therein, who is or shall be of the age of eighteen years, and under the age of forty-five years (except as is herein after excepted) shall severally and respectively be enrolled in the militia . . . . That every citizen so enrolled and notified, shall, within six months thereafter, provide himself with a good musket or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints, and a knapsack, a pouch with a box therein to contain not less than twenty-four cartridges, suited to the bore of his musket or firelock, each cartridge to contain a proper quantity of powder and ball: or with a good rifle, knapsack, shot-pouch and powder-horn, twenty balls suited to the bore of his rifle, and a quarter of a pound of powder. . . .\n \n \n Sec. 2. [Exempting the Vice President, federal judicial and executive officers, congressmen and congressional officers, custom-house officers and clerks, post-officers and postal stage drivers, ferrymen on post roads, export inspectors, pilots, merchant mariners, and people exempted under the laws of their states\n //end quote//\n \n \n So, there is no \"militia of one\". Even current US law requires that the militia is comprised of EVERYBODY who fits the guidelines set forth in the act. I am part of that militia. You are part of that militia. The only argument that could be made for NOT being part of the militia is if you do not fit the age requirements, you are not able bodied, or you re not a man. Of course, the \"not a man\" defense would most likely not work, but I suppose you could try arguing it, if you really wanted.",

   "The first part of your post is a quibble over the words Rights and Power. \n There really is no reason I know of the quibble about the words, for the following reasons:\n \n 1) When a foreigner has met the requirements of the law and wants to become a U.S. Citizen, the foreigner can ask for the government to grant him or her citizenship. If the government approves of the request, that approval \n grants you the same rights as any other citizen. So, the government has the right to not approve a request for citizenship. Again, I seen nothing but a semantic debate that is meaningless in this context. As the government can choose to do or not do something, it's no different than the government having the right to choose something and the authority to impose their decision. Whatever words are used here, it's just a meaningless semantic debate about which word you choose to use.\n \n 2) The remainder of your argument picks apart a sentence and uses words out of context, and doesn't even mention the most important part of what the object of that sentence is!\n \n The sentence refers to a militia.\n \n The entire sentence essentially says that the government will permit people to posses arms, for the purpose of forming a militia.\n \n That seems to be a pont you kinda overlooked.\n \n As it happens, we've got a militia already, and the government has not prevented keeping the weapons for our militia.\n \n However, you are a private citizen. And the government would be happy for you to bear arms in our militia in Iraq.\n \n Unfortunately, by yourself, you are nothing but an individual. And the 2nd Amendment does not apply to a militia of 1 person. \n \n The Supreme Court refused to debate that case when it was brought to them a few weeks ago.\n \n In the case, the lawyers were going to argue that an organization should be permitted to bear arms (i.e. own guns), but a private citizen is not entiled to do so under the 2nd Amendment, as 1 person is not a militia, but an organization of people can be considered to be a militia.\n \n Rather than read a sentence 2 or 3 words at a time, and loose the entire meaning of it, or omit the reason for the sentence entirely, it would make more sense to discuss what is being said in an entie phrase, rather than as you did.\n\n \n You totally miss the meaning and history of the Declaration of Independacne and Constitution. The People did not get rights from the government. Nor does did the government give the rights. The People of the United States took those rights named in the Constitution. A Constitution does not give rights, it limits what a government can do to the People.\n \n I am not a militia of 1 person. I am a member of an unregulated militia and so are you. You do not have a choice when you become 18. The government does not permit a militia. The government is PREVENTED from disbanding the militia. That is what the Constitution is all about, it is a document the limits what a government can do.\n \n The driving comparison is not correct. Driving is a priveldge not a right. Rights can only be removed by a judge/jurry or a judge/doctor. For example you only loose your rights when you become a criminal and go to prison or when you become insane. A blind man is neither and has his full rights. Minimimal requirements imposed on citizen for to exercise thier rights are unconstitutional and illegal for full citizens.\n \n Please find better examples than driving and the blind man. Plus as a good citizen it is your duty to tollerate other people who lawfully exercise thier\n rights. Thus it is your duty to tollerate even blind gun owners who lawfully exercise thier rights. \n \n That is why anti-gunners are comming after YOU. They despise your rights. They think thier privledge is superior to your rights. Anti-gunners do not have the right to live in a gun free society. Living in a gun\n free society is a priviledge. Thier privlidge is not superiour to my rights. Please also note that the members of the militia provide thier own firearms.",

   "daewoo, you raised an important point i don't disagree iwth. Namely, the definition of a militia at the time that the Constitution was written. Again, I didn't and don't disagree with that definition as it applies to that time, nor what was in the minds of the Founding Fathers.\n ,\n\n \n \n That is the start of message 100, I deleted the rest because it is long. Go back and read it, though, it is well worth your time. \n \n I agree entirely that the constitution is a living document. I disagree with you on the manner in which it changes (or is changed). The constitution contains specific instruction as to how to change it so as to ensure that it always reflects current events. Additions, or ammendments, can be added to the constitution, or removed from the constitution, pursuant to article five, which reads:\n \n //quote//\n The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate. \n //end quote//\n \n You will note that it does not allow for changes in meaning or content based on perceptual differences in timeline by judges or lawyers. The procedure for modifying the constitution is a difficult one. You need far more than the simple majority that is required to pass a regular law.\n \n Our founders, in their wisdom, did this on purpose. They did this to ensure that before foresaking any freedom or right that is gauranteed in the constitution, people had to think long and hard. This was specifically for the purpose of ensuring that we did not adapt the constitution in such a way as to haphazardly destroy rights today that we may need tommorow.\n \n I think this is especially true of the second amendment. The intention of the founders, after reviewing their papers and other contemporary sources from the period, was unquestionably to guarantee all americans an individual right to posess weapons. It is furthermore entirely clear through historical research that one of the reasons they wished to assure the people held this awsome power was in the event that the government would become tyranical and there would be a need for the population at large to overthrow it. This is alluded to several times in commentaries on the constitution, as well as being the primary topics of several papers by Jefferson. \n \n Many people look at this and say \"there is no reason to overthrow the government\", and I agree with them entirely. When the constitution was ratified, there was no more reason to overthrow the government than there is today. The british government had just been overthrown, and new government was not \"tyranical\". They still saw fit to include the provision that all men could be armed.\n \n So, we have established that today, there is no reason to overthrow the government. I believe that our government may be misguided on a few things. I believe that some sectors of our government are corrupt. I do not believe they fit the definition of \"tyranical\" by a long shot. The government at the time the constitution was written was not \"tyranical\" either. \n \n The second amendment is every bit as valid today as it was when it was written. The amendment is meant to serve not only as an assurance that the American citizenry would have the power to overthrow thier government if needed, but I think it was included as a reminder to our government that it is entirely subjegated to the will of the people. \n \n I do wish that our founding fathers could have had just a single glimpse of the future. I think it would have changed the way they worded the second amendment. Since the meaning of the second amendment is unequivically explained in their own writings, it seems a little odd that we would have such a problem interpeting it today. It seems as though they could have explained it a little more clearly. I believe that they believed that they HAD explained it clearly. Some of my other posts refer to the actual language of the amendment, including the speech conventions used at the time and the difference between \"powers\" and \"rights\" in the eyes of our founders. I will not bore everybody with re-canting the entire thing here.\n \n I think they didn't feel they needed to beat the meaning of the second amendment to death because, as you pointed out in post #100, everybody in that time already had a gun. It was kind of a tradition that boys be given their first rifle (actually most likely a musket) on their thirteenth birthday (usually theri father got a new one, and handed the old one down to the boy). Since guns were generally single shot weapons, most folks kept several of them for defensive purposes. There is an account from one unnamed source from the time that it was common for families that lived in \"the wilderness\" to be in possesion of up to 30 guns. This allowed the men to fire while the women reloaded.\n \n I think that what the modern anti-gunners are trying to do is short circuit the constitutional process for amendment. To the best of my knowledge, it is universally accepted that when attempting to interpet the constitution, historical research is required. The historical research leaves no question as to the meaning this section of the constitution. \n \n The proper thing to do if one wishes to remove the rights guaranteed by the second amendment, is to repeal it, not for politically alinged judges to make rulings based on politics and ignoring all historical evidence to the contrary. If people do not like the right as recognised by the second, they should CHANGE the recognised right. This can be done, and it is how our constitution requires that it be done.\n \n Now, a word on gun control. \n \n I have no problem with certain types of gun control. I do not think that felons should be allowed to have guns. Felons are not allowed to vote, or to hold public office, why shoudl their right to bear arms be especially protected? I think instant background checks are a fine idea.\n \n The problem I see, is that te instant background checks are NOT instant and are NOT keeping felons from obtaining guns. Somebody is certain to post the ATF numbers (or numbers from somewhere else) that show the numbers of \"felons\" who were kept from purchasing guns.\n \n I would urge you to contact whatever agency you obtained your report form and request the raw data for their report. The only place the data can actually be gotten is either the ATF or the DOJ. I have not reviewed the raw data for a while as the ATF charges quite handsomly for copies, you have to fill out a plethra of FOA forms, and pay for shipping. The raw data came (in 2000) in 14 file boxes, stuffed full with copies at (if I remember correctly) 8 cents per page. this was not a cheap project.\n \n What I found when doing my own number crunching is that while popular sources, including some law enforcement agencies and some of the more popular gun control groups, cited MILLIONS of felons being refused the ability to purchase a firearm, the actual numbaer was MUCH lower. From the inception of the brady bill to the end of the Clinton presidence, there were less than 10 people actually charged with attempting to purchase a firearm.\n \n What happened to the millions of other guys? Why didn't we prosocute them? Because in the vast majority of cases, they had done nothing wrong. The great big numbers people keep seeing posted are NOT the number of felons who tried to purchase guns. The numbers you have seen are usually based on the TOTAL number of rejections. The vast majority of those rejections are based on incomplete or incorrectly completed paperwork. \n \n Several of the rejections that were made basd on the criminal check were NOT due to felony convictions, but to municipal warrants, often issued in other states. How do you get a municipal warrant issued? In every one of the cases, it was unsatisfied traffic tickets or parking tickets, most of them several years old. In every single case of people with warrants that was investigated, it was found by the investigators that it was likely that the individual had no idea there was a warrant out there.\n \n In all those millions of rejections, less than 1.4% of the people actually were restriceted form getting a gun. The rest either appealed the decision and were cleared, or went back and paid their old speeding ticket and reapplied.\n \n My argument against the \"instant\" background check is that they cost millions a year, and they don't work. The number of people who are actually prohibited form purchasing a gun is pathetically small. Watching the news, though, it seems that these felons are still getting their guns. I know how.\n \n A while back I wanted to get my wife a handgun. My personal preference is a 1911A1 customised with a bobbed hammer and a beavertail grip (so the hammer doesn't cut a groove in your hand). My wife wanted something smaller. I wanted to get her an H&K 9mm. The particular model I wanted was $1200. I was complaining about this to a friend and he said \"I know a guy....\" I went with him to see his \"guy\" and bought a pre-ban H&K 9mm, new in box, with 3 hi-cap mags, never fired, for $450. The guys told me \"this gun is not on any import list, it has never been registered anywhere, it is entirely untracable\".\n \n I screwed up the whole \"untracable\" thing by asking one of our local sheriffs deputies to run the serial number for me (wife would have been REALLY upset if later something had happened and the police ran the numbers and said \"this gun was used to kill 25 cops in miami\". The gun came back \"no history\" no information at all was available for it.\n \n Now, I would challenge any anti gunner to answer me this----\n \n Why would a felon try to buy a gun at a gun store, background check or not, if they can buy a brand new, untracable weapon from \"alternative channels\" for a quarter the price?\n \n As long as these \"alternative channels\" exist, the largest result of the background checks is that we are spending millions of dollars a year to help cities collect unpaid traffic tickets from potential gun buyers. Where is the logic in this?\n \n If we could at least close our borders down to the point that millions of illegal aliens, and hundreds of tons of drugs are pouring across our borders each year, MAYBE we could do something constructive to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. Until then, more restrictive gun laws are just an annoyance to law abiding citizens. They are just in place to make the anti ginners feel like they have done something constructive when in reality they have done NOTHING.\n \n And the assault weapon ban........I will sum that up with one question. When was the last time you heard of a crime employing a bayonet? I have never heard of one. We still have to spend millions funding enforcement efforts for that piece of legislative trash. If you break down the number of assault weapons used in crimes, and then further break that number down to reflect the leaglly posessed assault weapons used in crimes, it becomes immediatly apparent that the assault weapon ban is a solution in search of a problem.",

   "I don't know if I would agree that all these folks just want to trample our rights and ignore the constitution. Many people who argue the \"collective rights\" theory just don't know any better. I think this is due to the measured propoganda of some of the anti gun zealots. Take a look at http://www1.law.ucla.edu/~volokh/ He is a constitutional law professor from UCLA. He is one of my favorites to cite, since he is a \"convert\" from the collective rights theory. Read his testemony to congress regarding the issue.\n \n Basically, he had always believed the collective rights theory because that is what he was taught in law school. He ended up having to research it for a class he was scheduled to teach. To his surprise, the view was wholly insupportable when researched using widely accepted research practices for dealing with constitutional law. A lot of his papers are available at the above link, you can find more by doing a search for \" Eugene Volokh \".\n \n Guy like him are important to have on our side. It has been stated by a few that Eugene will have a bigger impact on the future of gun rights than the NRA. His classes are required coursework, which means that a whole new generation of lawyers, thousands each year, come out of UCLA knowing beyond a doubt that the second amendment is an individual right. Someday, these lawyers will grow up to be judges, who will know beyond a doubt that the second amendment is an individual right.\n \n It is nearly impossible to change sombodies mind once it is set, especially on some of the gun issues where, in some cases, the anti-gunners views are so contrary to common sense that it is sad.\n \n You can roll up here, though, and have a lively debate, which is always fun. I do sometimes hope that some of the casual viewers of sites like this (like the 8th grade gentleman who was here the other day) might be swayed by a rational, well concieved argument backed up by solid facts and numbers. \n \n My last post was directed at Treat2. He is not an anti gunner, he has stated on multiple occasions that he is a gun owner. We were simply having a philisophical discussion on to what extent the constitution is a living document.",

   "Interpretations are only valid by a federal court, whether we like it or not. This won't go to the Supreme Court as they are too frightened of the implications. Me, I'm satisfied with the way things are, and I feel safe in saying that. It is a dangerous world, and if I protect myself and my family the way I see fit, this debate will go on and it won't concern me.\nI've noticed that there seem to be three basic interpretations of the second amendment. \n \n 1) The second amendment protects a collective right to bear arms. This is the position that has been taken by most of the lower federal courts in recent decades. \n \n 2) The second amendment protects a limited individual right. Individuals have a right to bear arms, but this right can be subject to reasonable restrictions and limitations in the interest of the common good. Such restrictions commonly include waiting periods, the banning of machine guns, gun registration and licensing. Attorney General John Ashcroft, for example, says that the second amendment protects an individual right to bear arms, but he has also stated that he supports the extension of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. \n \n 3) The second amendment protects an unlimited right to bear arms for adult, law-abiding citizens.\n",

I do agree that they just refuse to hear the case because they don't want to get into the middle of things.\n \n I use a legal advisor occasionally who is a retired federal judge. I have asked him about why the supreme court doesn't want to take the case. He claims that it is just so politically charged that they are afraid of the consequesnces. I spoke with him earlier today about the 9th circuits decision, and it is he who pointed out that they dodged the bullet completely. What they found was that none of the plantifs had cause to request relief from the court. He said that the \"DC residents don't have the same rights as others\" adn the whole second amendment analysis (whihc is actually as odds with rulings from the majority of the judicial circuits) was a political ploy. \n \n There are now 3 districts that have implicitly said that the second gives a \"collective\" right. They are directly in contrast with a half dozen districts that claim it is an individual rigt (also in contrast to the MILLER fiunding by the supreme court).

See id. at 923....'Technical' membership in a state militia (e.g., membership in an 'unorganized' state militia) or membership in a non-governmental military organization is not sufficient to satisfy the 'reasonable relationship' test.

   "I hate it when people quote the whole message, but I am going to anway because I think you present some important argument here and I want to make certain that those who see the reply catch the context of the argument.\n \n First off, in Jeffersons papers, as collected at the library of congress, the smitsonian, and other institutions, he uses the term \"Bear Arms\" a total of 347 times. Of those, only 54 refer to any type of miliatry service, military units, or government service. The remainder refer entirely to individuals.\n\n Even if it's talking about individuals it could be talking about individuals bearing arms in connection with a militia. And you say this based on what source? \n \n \n \nIf you look at the commentaries of the constitution at the time, including papers written by the original signers, you will find that the second amendment is discussed in great length by the majority of those people, and in every single case, it is referred to as an individual right, unlimited in scope.\n\n I don't think so. James Madison's first draft of the second amendment was \"The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country: but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.\" It's quite clear there that the term \"bear arms\" is referring to military service. Furthermore, if you look at the debates of that the first congress that surrounded the adoption of the second amendment it was frequently debated whether certain people should be exempted from bearing arms (militia service). \n \n Looking at the root meaning of the word further confirms this:\n \"To bear arms is, in itself, a military term. One does not bear arms against a rabbit. The phrase simply translates the Latin arma ferre. The infinitive ferre, to bear, comes from the verb fero. The plural noun arma explains the plural usage in English ('arms'). One does not 'bear arm.' Latin arma is, etymologically, war 'equipment,' and it has no singular forms.' 16 By legal and other channels, arma ferre entered deeply into the European language of war. To bear arms is such a synonym for waging war that Shakespeare can call a just war 'just-borne arms' and a civil war 'self-borne arms.' 17 Even outside the phrase 'bear arms,' much of the noun&#47977; use alone echoes Latin phrases: to be under arms (sub armis), the call to arms (ad arma), to follow arms (arma sequi), to take arms (arma capere), to lay down arms (arma ponere).\"\n http://www.potowmack.org/garwills.html\n \n A State Supreme Court understood the meaning of the term \"bear arms\" quite well. \"The 28th section of our bill of rights provides, 'that no citizen of this State shall be compelled to bear arms, provided he will pay in equivalent, to be ascertained by law.' Here we know that the phrase has a military sense, and no other; and we must infer that it is used in the same sense in the 26th section, which secures to the citizen the right to bear arms. A man in the pursuit of deer, elk and buffaloes, might carry his rifle every day, for forty years, and, yet, it would never be said of him, that he had borne arms, much less could it be said, that a private citizen bears arms, because he has a dirk or pistol concealed under his clothes, or a spear in a cane.\"\n Aymette v. State, 21 Tenn. (2 Hump.) 154 (1840) \n \n The 9th Circuit Court in its thorough historical analysis of the second amendment explains: \"We consider it highly significant, however, that the second clause does not purport to protect the right to 'possess' or 'own' arms, but rather to 'keep and bear' arms. This choice of words is important because the phrase 'bear arms' is a phrase that customarily relates to a military function. Historical research shows that the use of the term 'bear arms' generally referred to the carrying of arms in military service- not the private use of arms for personal purposes. n28 For instance, Professor Dorf, after canvassing documents from the founding era, concluded that 'overwhelmingly, the term had a military connotation.' ....Further, the Oxford English Dictionary defines 'to bear arms' as 'to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight.' 1 OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY 634 (J.A. Simpson & E.S.C. Weiner, eds., 2d ed. 1989) (quoted in Yassky, supra, at 619). Thus, the use of the phrase 'bear arms' in its second clause strongly suggests that the right that the Second Amendment seeks to protect is the right to carry arms in connection with military service.\"\n http://www.potomac-inc.org/silveira.html\n \n \n David Yassky explains, \"searching a Library of Congress database containing all official records of debates in the Continental and the U.S. Congress between 1774 and 1821 reveals thirty uses of the phrase 'bear arms' or 'bearing arms' (other than in discussing the proposed second amendment); and in every single one of these uses, the phrase has an unambiguously military meaning.\"\n \"The Second Amendment: Structure, History, and Constitutional Change\" 99 Mich.

The whole people is the corpus sanum, what Madison calls 'the people at large.' 52 Thus 'the people' form militias though not every individual is included in them.\"\n http://www.potomac-inc.org/garwills.html\n\n \n Your concept of a militia is not a militia.

   "This Post took about 9 hours to think through and write up.\n Hope it rejuvinates the debate. \n Much as I am a gun owner, I'm not seeing to much in the Second.. Here's why...\n \n Whether or not the 2nd Amendment was written to provide for the protection of the States from a foreign invasion, or border dispute, or Civil War, it is clear that the objective of the 2nd Amendment is to address the basic provisions and control required to form a militia reporting to the President. \n \n One of the provisions to form a militia is explicitly stated in the \n 2nd Amendment as the unrestricted Right of the individual to own guns. \n \n At that time in our history, when a militia was formed, it was expected that individuals would bring their own gun(s) to the militia. That provision is THE IMPLICIT PURPOSE of the Right of the individual to own guns.\n \n Within the 2nd Amendment, there are NO OTHER IMPLICIT, NOR EXPLICIT purposes pertaining to the unrestricted Right of the individual to own gun(s). \n \n In other words, the 2nd Amendment does NOT IMPLICITLY, NOR EXPLICITLY suggest or expand its purpose beyond what it required for a militia, and the control of a militia.\n \n The 2nd Amendment does NOT provide an individual the Right to own gun(s) for the PURPOSE OF providing for: food, self-defense, target practice, a hobby as a collector, or fun..\n \n Therefore, ANY OTHER PURPOSE OR REASON for the possession of guns that has been attributed to rights under the 2nd Amendment is based entirely upon thoughts and purposes that were NOT IN THE MINDS OF the Founding Fathers when the 2nd Amendment was written.\n \n The Founding Fathers knew many people required guns to provide for food, income, and home-defense. Yet, the Founding Fathers did not separate the purpose of the unrestricted Right of individuals to own guns for a militia, from the SOLE PURPOSE of owning guns for the creation of a militia.\n \n The Founding Fathers did not write the 2nd Amendment in a manner that\n would even suggest that the Right of an individual to own guns had purposes beyond a militia, that would provide for: food, self-defense, target practice, a hobby as a collector, or fun..\n \n We may therefore conclude that, any reason or purpose for an individual owning a gun, OTHER THAN for a militia, is not provided for under the 2nd Amendment, and that current gun laws for private ownership of guns is mistaken.\n \n Justifications or reasons to provide individuals with a Right to own guns for a purpose or reason other than a militia, would have to be based on some Amendment, other than the 2nd Amendment, to determine if any such Right exists for individual gun ownership exists.\n \n That the Founding Fathers did not write all Amendments with the explicit and specific Rights of individuals for every condition and circumstance is self-explanatory, as the size of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution would be enormous, and the Founding Fathers would still be busy writing the Bill of Rights and a Constitution if that was the case.\n However, the Founding Fathers were very careful in their use of words and phrases, and in the logical composition of a Constitution, and that they decided not to specify other purposes exist that justify individual gun ownership, beyond a militia, in the 2nd Amendment. That decision would appear to be intentional.\n \n Although it might ideal to understand all that the Founding Fathers had in mind, when the Constitution was written, it must also be understood \n and concluded that what was the basis for a rational giving the Founding Fathers reasons to create an Amendment, and chose specific terms, phrases, and specifics, may not exist today, nor even be of any importance. \n \n For example, individuals need not carry guns from their home to where our troops will gather. Today's \"militia\" provides for the a militia's need, and an individual's need for guns. What the Founding Fathers once wrote with respect to an individual possessing a gun for the purpose of a militia and the remainder of the 2nd Amendment requires revision or elimination.",

As I recall the point to the second ammendment was to allow citizenry to maintain weapons in order that, in an emergency, when the regular army was insufficient for any number of reasons, then the citizenry would be called upon to defend the country. It was intended to prevent invasion. \n \n It was also intended to show that the ordinary citizenry are not outclassed by the regular army. Hence, the right not to be required to board soldiers. \n \n The right to own guns is a necessary right. It is not limited to anything organized. The word does not appear in the constitution.",

The 2nd Amendment is very clear, it is not a requirement to bear arms. The militia is a requirment of for the security of a free state, not to bear arms. Yes the 2nd amendment is meant for the militia, the militia is not a necessary requirment. The militia is supported by the right to bear arms, not the other way around. As a militia memember both organized and unorganzied, my right to bear arms is guaranteed to not be infringed, the same for even citizens who are not in the militia. The right to bear arms exists as a right unto itself.\n \n If you use the \"militia\" portion of the text, your position makes no sense: \"A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state\"\n \n \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" is totally clear.\n \n The militia portion of the text is equalivant of fluf just like judical opinion.",

   "The original intent and purpose of the Second Amendment was to preserve and guarantee, not grant the pre-existing right of individuals, to keep and bear arms. Although the amendment emphasizes the need for a militia, membership in any militia let alone a well regulated one, is not required to exercise the right to keep and bear arms. \n \n There is no evidence from the writings of the Founding Fathers, early American legal commentators, or pre-twentieth century Supreme Court decisions, indicating that the Second Amendment applied only to members of a well regulated militia or that the sole purpose of this amendment was to preserve the right of states to keep their militias. \n \n As for your no nuts with guns. If a person has been adjudicated mentally incompetent, then that person can be denied some rights. This law is on the books.\n \n As for felons not having guns. Do you mean ex felons? Because felons have been convicted of a crime and are serving a sentence. If that sentence is shorted by a felon being paroled from prison, the felon is still completing their sentence just not in prison. The felon is required to live by the department of corrections guide lines. The department of corrections for many states do not allow felons to have guns. Why do the people that want to ban the right to bear arms use this lie? Now if the people that want as they call them reasonable limits on a right want to do some good, why don't you fight to keep dangerous criminals in prison?

   "The second ammendment specifically says that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed...........However, the context includes that of a well regulated militia. Note the word REGULATED. The people are allowed to keep and bear arms....within REGULATIONS.\n \n\n \n \n Wrong...... Well regulated as used in context in the 1700s was defined as:\n \n Well Regulated \n \n Of all the words in the Second Amendment, \"well regulated\" probably causes the most confusion. The Random House College Dictionary (1980) gives four definitions for the word \"regulate,\" which were all in use during the Colonial period (Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Edition, 1989): \n \n 1) To control or direct by a rule, principle, method, etc.\n 2) To adjust to some standard or requirement as for amount, degree, etc.\n \n 3) To adjust so as to ensure accuracy of operation.\n \n 4) To put in good order. \n \n The first definition, to control by law in this case, was already provided for in the Constitution. It would have been unnecessary to repeat the need for that kind of regulation. For reference, here is the passage from Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, granting the federal government the power to regulate the militia: \n \n To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress; \n \n Some in their enthusiasm to belong to a well regulated militia have attempted to explain well regulated by using the definition \"adjust so as to ensure accuracy.\" A regulated rifle is one that is sighted-in. However well regulated modifies militia, not arms. That definition is clearly inappropriate. \n \n This leaves us with \"to adjust to some standard...\" or \"to put in good order.\" Let's let Alexander Hamilton explain what is meant by well regulated in Federalist Paper No. 29: \n \n The project of disciplining all the militia of the United States is as futile as it would be injurious if it were capable of being carried into execution. A tolerable expertness in military movements is a business that requires time and practice. It is not a day, nor a week nor even a month, that will suffice for the attainment of it. To oblige the great body of the yeomanry and of the other classes of the citizens to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well regulated militia, would be a real grievance to the people and a serious public inconvenience and loss. \n --- See The Federalist Papers, No. 29. \n \n \n \"To put in good order\" is the correct interpretation of well regulated, signifying a well disciplined, trained, and functioning militia. \n \n This quote from the Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774-1789 also conveys the meaning of well regulated: \n \n Resolved , That this appointment be conferred on experienced and vigilant general officers, who are acquainted with whatever relates to the general economy, manoeuvres and discipline of a well regulated army. \n --- Saturday, December 13, 1777. \n \n \n The Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Edition, (1989) defines regulated in 1690 to have meant \"properly disciplined\" when describing soldiers: \n \n [obsolete sense] \n b. Of troops: Properly disciplined. Obs. rare-1. \n \n 1690 Lond. Gaz. No. 2568/3 We hear likewise that the French are in a great Allarm in Dauphine and Bresse, not having at present 1500 Men of regulated Troops on that side. \n \n The text itself also suggests the fourth definition (\"to put in good order\"). Considering the adjective \"well\" and the context of the militia clause, which is more likely to ensure the security of a free state, a militia governed by numerous laws (or just the right amount of laws [depending on the meaning of \"well\"] ) or a well-disciplined and trained militia? \n \n Well regulated has nothing to do with law or regulations on 'the people'....",

I mean no disrespect generally. I do not like prejudicial comments when people characterize me as \"anti-gun\" because I am for some reasonable limits.\n \n I am aware criminals do not obey laws to begin with. I am a member of the NRA myself. I am a conservative and have never voted to support any new gun legislation. I have vehemently opposed it. My point being that reasonable limits are reasonable. It is innappropriate for a just society with a maintained civil service such as a police force to have its citizens carrying fully automatic weapons loaded and in plain view all over the streets. That is not making any sense. People are hot headed by nature. We argue and fight on a regular basis. \n \n You are a resonable person and say you would never harm anyone with your weapon unless they are attacking you (I think you would say this anyway.) The taking of another human life is a very serious thing. The laws are there to protect gun owners as much as those who might be shot. I do not own a gun. I am a memeber of the NRA. I do not wish to own a gun. I do not think I have need of one. I live in a very large metropolitan area. I do not support further legislation. I do support the enforcement of what is current. I think some could be repealed but am okay with what is there. The second ammendment does not allow for the infringement of this right because of the need for a WELL REGULATED MILITIA. Correct the militia is what is regulated. However, I am allowed to say that I disagree with you. I cannot yell fire in a crowded theater unless there is a fire. My first ammendment right is limited. My second ammendment right is limited to allow for the clear and present danger that certain things might pose. \n \n I used the extreme argument of tanks with full shells. Clear and Present Danger with that. \n \n I still ask the question, where do we draw the line. I notice not one of you advocating for unrestricted gun ownership has answered that question. In spite of claims such as felons who have not had their rights restored or insane people should not be allowed guns. You agree with some limits. It is inherent in your argument.

   "Akhil Reed Amar, a leading scholar of constitutional law and author of The Bill of Rights: Creation and Reconstruction, explains,\n \"But the libertarian reading must contend with textual embarrassments of its own. The amendment speaks of a right of 'the people' collectively rather than a right of 'persons' individually. And it uses a distinctly military phrase: 'bear arms.'....The rest of the Bill of Rights confirms this communitarian reading. The core of the First Amendment's assembly clause, which textually abuts the Second Amendment, is the right of 'the people'--in essence, voters--to 'assemble' in constitutional conventions and other political conclaves. So, too, the core rights retained and reserved to 'the people' in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments were rights of the people collectively to govern themselves democratically. The Fourth Amendment is trickier: 'The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.' Here, the collective 'people' wording is paired with more individualistic language of 'persons.'\" \n http://www.constitution.org/2ll/2ndschol/103wha.htm\n \n But whether the second amendment protects an individual right or a collective right the important part is that it protects a right in connection with a well-regulated militia. The 8th Circuit Court explained this quite clearly. \n \n \"Citing dicta from United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 265, 110 S.Ct. 1056, 1060, 108 L.Ed.2d 222 (1990), Hale argues that the Second Amendment protections apply to individuals and not to states or collective entities like militias. This argument is inapplicable to this case. The purpose of the Second Amendment is to restrain the federal government from regulating the possession of arms where such regulation would interfere with the preservation or efficiency of the militia. See Miller, 307 U.S. at 178, 59 S.Ct. at 818; United States v. Oakes, 564 F.2d 384 (10th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 926, 98 S.Ct. 1493, 55 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978); Cody, 460 F.2d 34. Whether the 'right to bear arms' for militia purposes is 'individual' or 'collective' in nature is irrelevant where, as here, the individual's possession of arms is not related to the preservation or efficiency of a militia.\" U.S. v. Hale (8th Cir. 1992)",

   "First of all, I wanted to say that this has been, in general, a very good thread. I just finished reading all the posts, and I think that both sides have made very good points, in particular about what the second amendment protects.\n \n My first question is about the militia. Staying away from the orginized v. unorginized question for a moment, it seems that there are some that do accept that the 'militia' part of the amendment is important, but we are (mostly) all part of a militia stemming from US Code Title 10:\n \n The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard.\n \n Thus, you right to own a gun stems from the fact that by definition almost everyone has the right to own a gun. However, would this imply that your if you are not in the National Guard, you can only own a gun if you are male?\n \n This may be silly, but it is an honest question.\n \n PS - if you don't believe that the 'militia' part of the 2nd amendment is important, you don't have to reply to this. That would be another argument.\n \n THanks for your thoughts.\n \n -Dan",

The often quoted US v. Miller makes pretty clear, it seems to me, that certain weapons are not protected by the 2nd amendment. So, you do not have a 'right' to own any gun as provided by the Bill of Rights. Does anyone argue with this?

He was thus charged by to be in violation of the NFA.\n Mr. Miller claimed that this indictment was unconstitutional because it violated the 2nd amendment.

It said that the NFA was constitutional (because of the whole milita thing) , thus congress did have a right to regualte certain types of firearms. they did not say that the gun was unconstitutional. They said that regulating the gun WAS constitutional, so if congress wanted, in theory, they could make the gun illgegal.\n \n I will try to use an example. Let's say that the Constitution said that all people have the right to have pistols. That does not mean that rifles would be illegal. However, if congress passed a law that said rifles were illegal, that could not be overturned by the Supreme Court. However, congress could not pass a law saying that all pistols were illegal.

   "First of all, thanks for brining up US v. Cruikshank, whoever did. (I think that it was Kelvin, but JAG, I believe, has mentioned some of its implications before. I am glad that it is brought up, because it does seem somewhat odd, in that I have never really heard the pre existing rights argumet often used, and in the implications that it seems to have.\n \n I do agree that that it states (US v. Cruikshank) that the Constitution does not grant the right to bear arms, that the right to bear arms was \"pre-existing,\" and all that the Contstitution states is that the federal government cannot take that right away. It compares the 2nd amemdment to the right to assmeble, etc, as a right that derives is its source \"from those laws whose authority is acknowledged by civilized man throughout the world\".\n \n I am, however, suprised that gun rights advocates use this case to defend the right to own guns, because the case seems to imply the opposite, as stated by Tim.\n \n The opinion seems to indicate that although congress has no power to regulate guns, the states do...\n \n When discussing the 1st amendment, which is decided also has the status of a pre existing right, the opinion states: \n \n  The particular amendment now under consideration assumes the existence of the right of the people to assemble for lawful purposes, and protects it against encroachment by Congress. The right was not created by the amendment; neither was its continuance guaranteed, except as against congressional interference. For their protection in its enjoyment, therefore, the people must look to the States.\n \n Then when moving on to the 2nd amendment, the opinion states:\n \n The second and tenth counts are equally defective. The right there specified is that of 'bearing arms for a lawful purpose.' This is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed; but this, as has been seen, means no more than that it shall not be infringed by Congress.\n \n I guess that I must be misinterpreting something, because to me, it seems pretty clear, that the opinion is stating that the 2nd amendment only limits the federal government from regulating firearms, not that states. If this were ture, though, why do pro gun advocates site it? Please, of someone can help clarify, it would be appreciated. Any links to interpretations, implications, etc, of this case would be greatly appreciated.\n \n In quick response to JOG's question,\n \n \nIf states can restrict rights then why can't states pass racist and sexist laws?\n\n \n ...although, of course, there has been much difference of opinion on this over the last 100 years or so, the 14th amendment EXPLICITLY says that STATES cannot deprive any one of life, libterty, etc...\n \n ..I am not an expert by any means on Jim Crow Laws, etc, so if I am wrong about any of that, please correct me.

   " The question was if states can limit one right, then why cannot the state's limit other rights?\n \n\n Because that's what the Supreme Court has ruled.\n \"By its express terms, the Bill of Rights applies only to the federal government. However, the 1st Amendment and most of the remaining amendments in the Bill of Rights apply to state governments today because of the judicially created 'Incorporation Doctrine'. \n \n Beginning in 1925, the justices gradually incorporated the provisions of the Bill of Rights into the 14th Amendment's 'due process' clause by declaring that each of the rights was 'fundamental' to the conception of due process of law.\" \n \n But not all the amendments in the Bill of Rights have been applied to the states through the 14th amendment's due process clause.\n \n \"The 'total' or 'full' incorporation theory has never commanded a majority of the Court. Although Justice Black maintained that one of the chief objects of the 14th Amendment was to make the Bill of Rights applicable to the states, the historical record is ambiguous and the court has opted for 'selective' incorporation. At this point, the only provisions of the first eight amendments that have not been incorporated are the 2nd and 3rd Amendments, the 5th Amendment's requirement of grand jury indictment, and the 7th Amendment.\"\n \n So states can limit rights protected by the 2nd, 3rd, 7th amendments and the 5th amendment's right to a grand jury indictment. States cannot limit your 1st amendment rights, but a state can have you stand trial for a crime even if you have not been indicted by a grand jury. Does it seem inconsistent? Well, it's the law and what the courts have decided.",

Again, giving the states the responsibility of defending the right, but not giving them the option of limiting it.\n \n The next couple of passages explain this further:\n \n //qoute//\n The third and eleventh counts are even more objectionable. They charge the intent to have been to deprive the citizens named, they being in Louisiana, 'of their respective several lives and liberty of person without due process of law.' This is nothing else than alleging a conspiracy to falsely imprison or murder citizens of the United States, being within the territorial jurisdiction of the State of Louisiana. The rights of life and personal liberty are natural rights of man. 'To secure these rights,' says the Declaration of Independence, 'governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.' The very highest duty of the States, when they entered into the Union under the Constitution, was to protect all persons within their boundaries in the enjoyment of these 'unalienable rights with which they were endowed by their Creator.' Sovereignty, for this purpose, rests alone with the States. It is no more the duty or within the power of the United States to punish for a conspiracy [92 U.S. 542, 554] to falsely imprison or murder within a State, than it would be to punish for false imprisonment or murder itself. \n \n The fourteenth amendment prohibits a State from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; but this adds nothing to the rights of one citizen as against another. It simply furnishes an additional guaranty against any encroachment by the States upon the fundamental rights which belong to every citizen as a member of society. As was said by Mr. Justice Johnson, in Bank of Columbia v. Okely, 4 Wheat. 244, it secures 'the individual from the arbitrary exercise of the powers of government, unrestrained by the established principles of private rights and distributive justice.' These counts in the indictment do not call for the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this provision in the amendment\n //end quote//\n \n By editing the second section cited, and disregarding the entire rest of the ruling which explains the concept further (full text can be found at http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=92&invol=542), you could, indeed, conclude that this ruling finds that the states have the power to limit your second amendment rights. If you include the entire text of the ruling, it becomes clear that this is not the case but rather it holds the states responsible for protecting your second amendment rights. \n \n \n Does it seem to anybody else that we seem to go around and around in this thread????\n\n Did you examine the entire text of the ruling? \n \n The court stated that \"We have in our political system a government of the United States and a government of each of the several States. Each one of these governments is distinct from the others, and each has citizens of its own who owe it allegiance, and whose rights, within its jurisdiction, it must protect. The same person may be at the same time a citizen of the United States and a citizen of a State, but his rights of citizenship under one of these governments will be different from those he has under the other.\"\n \n Notice the last sentence. So if the federal government is in charge of safeguarding the right to bear arms then it would seem that the states would not have the same responsibility since \"rights of citizenship under one of these governments will be different from those he has under the other.\"",
