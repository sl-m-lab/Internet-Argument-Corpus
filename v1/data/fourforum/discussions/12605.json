   "This is taken from another debate on another thread, Galileo posted this article as an example of how slanted and biased World Net Daily is, but I want to discuss the content of this article and the arguments if offers regarding the issue of who it is that molests little boys and why the homosexual community gets a pass on this crime as a social issue within it given the evidence this article clarifies?\n \n I think it's important to make this debate about supportable facts and social observations and not about attacking the sources used to make points on either side of the issue.\n \n \n\"Baldwin says his research not only 'confirms that homosexuals molest children at a rate vastly higher than heterosexuals,' but it found that 'the mainstream homosexual culture' even 'commonly promotes sex with children.' \"\n Report: Pedophilia more common among 'gays'\n \n Another fine example of \"objective\" reporting from the World Net Daily.\n\n \n Show me what isn't totally objective about this article Galileo!!! It quotes a rebuttal from gay sources which attempt to refute its conclusions and definitely gives both sides of the story a hearing while defending its perspective. So point out clearly how it isn't objective if you can. Here's the article:\n Report: Pedophilia more common among 'gays'\n Research purports to reveal 'dark side' of homosexual culture\n Posted: April 29, 2002\n 1:00 am Eastern\n \n By Jon Dougherty\n \u00a9 2009 WorldNetDaily.com\n \n Child molestation and pedophilia occur far more commonly among homosexuals than among heterosexuals on a per capita basis, according to a new study.\n \n \"Overwhelming evidence supports the belief that homosexuality is a sexual deviancy often accompanied by disorders that have dire consequences for our culture,\" wrote Steve Baldwin in, \"Child Molestation and the Homosexual Movement,\" soon to be published by the Regent University Law Review.\n \n Baldwin is the executive director of the Council for National Policy in Washington, D.C.\n \n \"It is difficult to convey the dark side of the homosexual culture without appearing harsh,\" wrote Baldwin. \"However, it is time to acknowledge that homosexual behavior threatens the foundation of Western civilization - the nuclear family.\"\n \n Though the homosexual community and much of the media scoff at such accusations, Baldwin - who chaired the California Assembly's Education committee, where he fought against support for the homosexual agenda in the state's public schools - says in his report that homosexual activists' \"efforts to target children both for their own sexual pleasure and to enlarge the homosexual movement\" constitute an \"unmistakable\" attack on \"the family unit.\"\n \n Baldwin's research is substantiated in a recently completed body of work written by Dr. Judith Reisman, president of the Institute for Media Education and author of numerous authoritative books debunking sexual myths, including \"Kinsey, Crimes & Consequences.\"\n \n In her thesis - also written for the Regent University Law Review - Reisman cited psychologist Eugene Abel, whose research found that homosexuals \"sexually molest young boys with an incidence that is occurring from five times greater than the molestation of girls. ...\"\n \n Abel also found that non-incarcerated \"child molesters admitted from 23.4 to 281.7 acts per offender ... whose targets were males.\"\n \n \"The rate of homosexual versus heterosexual child sexual abuse is staggering,\" said Reisman, who was the principal investigator for an $800,000 Justice Department grant studying child pornography and violence. \"Abel's data of 150.2 boys abused per male homosexual offender finds no equal (yet) in heterosexual violations of 19.8 girls.\"\n \n Jay Heavener, spokesman for PFLAG - Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, counters that federal crime data refute claims that homosexuals molest children at higher rates than heterosexuals.\n \n \"According to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), this claim is false,\" he told WND by e-mail. \"The gay and lesbian community calls into question any dubious research which flies in the face of our own experience.\"\n \n And Gary Schoener, a clinical psychologist who has been diagnosing and treating clergy abuse for 28 years, told Salon.com, \"There are far more heterosexual cases than homosexual.\"\n \n In terms of sheer numbers, that may be true. But in terms of numbers of children abused per offender, homosexuals abuse with far greater frequency; and boys, research shows, are the much-preferred target.\n \n Baldwin says evidence he examined disproves the assertion that child molestation is more prevalent among heterosexuals. Both he and Reisman found that media coverage of adult homosexual abuse of minors is also slanted.\n \n \"The National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association (NLGJA) recently boasted that although homosexuals are less than two percent of the population, three-fourths of the people who decide the content of the front page of the New York Times are homosexual,\" Reisman wrote.\n \n That one fact is especially noteworthy, experts point out, given the recent child sex scandals taking place within the American Catholic church.\n \n A survey by WorldNetDaily of recent news reports found that rarely did the media describe priestly sexual abuse as \"homosexual\" or \"gay\" activity - even though the worst incidents involved male-to-male contact, and a spate of investigative reports has revealed that the Vatican is concerned about an upsurge of homosexuals in seminary schools throughout the world.\n \n Gay press promotes sex with children\n \n Baldwin says his research not only \"confirms that homosexuals molest children at a rate vastly higher than heterosexuals,\" but it found that \"the mainstream homosexual culture\" even \"commonly promotes sex with children.\"\n \n \"The editorial board of the leading pedophile academic journal, Paidika, is dominated by prominent homosexual scholars such as San Francisco State University professor John DeCecco, who happens to edit the Journal of Homosexuality,\" Baldwin wrote.\n \n During his research, he also found:\n \n The Journal of Homosexuality recently published a special double-issue entitled, \"Male Intergenerational Intimacy,\" containing many articles portraying sex between men and minor boys as loving relationships. One article said parents should look upon the pedophile who loves their son \"not as a rival or competitor, not as a theft of their property, but as a partner in the boy's upbringing, someone to be welcomed into their home.\"\n In 1995 the homosexual magazine \"Guide\" said, \"We can be proud that the gay movement has been home to the few voices who have had the courage to say out loud that children are naturally sexual\" and \"deserve the right to sexual expression with whoever they choose. ...\" The article went on to say: \"Instead of fearing being labeled pedophiles, we must proudly proclaim that sex is good, including children's sexuality ... we must do it for the children's sake.\"\n Larry Kramer, the founder of ACT-UP, a noted homosexual activist group, wrote in his book, \"Report from the Holocaust: The Making of an AIDS Activist\": \"In those instances where children do have sex with their homosexual elders, be they teachers or anyone else, I submit that often, very often, the child desires the activity, and perhaps even solicits it.\"\n In a study of advertisements in the influential homosexual newspaper, The Advocate, Reisman found ads for a \"Penetrable Boy Doll ... available in three provocative positions. She also found that the number of erotic boy images in each issue of The Advocate averaged 14.\n Homosexual newspapers and travel publications advertise prominently for countries where boy prostitution is heavy, such as Burma, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand.\n Homosexuality 'youth-oriented'?\n \n \"Research on the homosexual lifestyle confirms it is almost exclusively a youth-oriented culture,\" Baldwin wrote. \"Very few gays exhibit preference for older men.\"\n \n \"Some admit to focus on teenage boys,\" he said, \"some on prepubescent boys, and many cross over between categories.\"\n \n A 1988 study detailed in Baldwin's report found that most pedophiles even consider themselves to be \"gay.\" According to the study, \"Archives of Sexual Behavior,\" some 86 percent of pedophiles described themselves as homosexual or bisexual. Also, the study found, the number of teenage male prostitutes who identify as homosexuals has risen from 10 percent to 60 percent in the past 15 years.\n \n When asked what he thought about critics who attempt to debunk his research, Baldwin said the results speak for themselves.\n \n \"For them to say this theory is false is to call many of the homosexual movement's leaders liars,\" he said. \"Most of my evidence comes right from the gay community.\"\n \n \"I managed to find enough evidence that my thesis - child molestation is an integral part of the homosexual movement - is a valid thesis,\" Baldwin told WorldNetDaily.\n \n Other experts have also found a distinct pattern between child sex abusers and the incidence of homosexuality.\n \n \"How long can psychologists be in denial about the significance of the dark side, and ignore what it implies about the homosexual condition? And there's a matter of even greater concern. How long will psychologists eagerly throw open the door to gay life for every sexually confused teenager?\" writes Joseph Nicolosi, Ph.D, on behalf of NARTH - the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality - a group that says it exists to \"provide psychological understanding of the cause, treatment and behavior patterns associated with homosexuality, within the boundaries of a civil public dialogue.\"\n \n The North American Man-Boy Love Association, or NAMBLA, is \"a group that openly promotes sex with minor boys and claims that boy-lovers respond to the needs of the boys they love,\" Baldwin said in his report.\n \n The group is often endorsed by \"many of the homosexual movement's most prominent leaders,\" he said.\n \n Advocacy moving to schools\n \n Promotion of the \"gay and lesbian lifestyle\" is increasing in the nation's public schools.\n \n A WND survey of homosexual-oriented websites found that almost every group has some sort of program to \"educate\" teachers, school administrators and other school employees about the homosexual lifestyle:\n \n GLSEN - the Gay Lesbian and Straight Education Network - bills itself as \"the largest national network of parents, students, educators and others\" specifically formed to end \"discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression in K-12 schools. Two recent press released boasted of the Broward County (Fla.) school board approving GLSEN-sponsored \"training for teachers.\"\n A student activist working with GLSEN officials has managed to \"give voice\" recently to \"gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered students\" at California schools;\n PFLAG has created a national campaign called, \"From Our House to the Schoolhouse,\" distributing to school officials - among other materials - a booklet entitled, \"Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation and Youth: A Primer For Principals, Educators, & School Personnel. [Editor's note: Readers need the Adobe PDF reader to open and read this file.]\n Though most school-related programs are sold to administrators and parents as programs designed simply to end persecution of homosexuals and lesbians, none disclose what Baldwin says is compelling evidence that homosexuality is harmful to children.\n \n \"What ... does the academic literature say about the relationship between homosexuality and child molestation? Quite a bit, actually,\" he wrote, quoting data compiled by the Family Research Institute: \"Scientific studies confirm a strong pedophilic predisposition among homosexuals.\"\n \n The institute, after reviewing more than 19 studies and peer-reviewed reports in a 1985 \"Psychological Reports\" article, found that homosexuals account for between 25 and 40 percent of all child molestation.\n \n \"But this number is low,\" Baldwin says, \"due to the fact that many reporters will not report if a child molester is a homosexual, even if he knows that to be the case.\"\n Now, consider that the vast majority of child molestation cases are against boys not girls and add to that the number of straight males to homosexual males which puts homosexuals at only 2% of the population in this article, (I thought it was more like 4%) and you have an extreme per capita imbalance in favor of homosexual molestation over heterosexuals. And I think this article proves that very effectively while giving the opposition side a hearing in explaining their side as reflected in the bolded.",

   "Here's another link which confirms this argument in very clear terms. The applicable section is in chapter 4.\n \n THE HOMOSEXUAL ISSUES INVOLVING CHILDREN IN CANADA\n Q6 Are homosexual men more inclined to child molestation than heterosexual men?\n In gross numbers, no. Proportionally, yes, much more.\n According to American studies, the evidence indicates that homosexual men molest boys and teenagers at rates completely disproportionate to the rates at which heterosexual men molest girls. A study shows that the homosexual child molester accounts for approximately 7 times more victims than the heterosexual molester. When it comes to child sex abuse, men are almost always the perpetrator. Up to one-third or more of child sex abuse cases are committed against boys, but less than 3% of the population is homosexual. Also according to a study published in Adolescence, 29% of the adult children of homosexual parents have been specifically subjected to sexual molestation as a child by a homosexual parent, compared to only 0.6 percent of adult children of heterosexual parents. \n According to the American Journal of Diseases of Children and The Advocate, close to 60% of adolescent AIDS sufferers were infected by adult bisexual and homosexual men. Thousands of these American boys are now dead. The same is probably true for other western countries like Canada, where many young runaway boys end up prostituting themselves for men.\n Although pedophilia is condemned by most homosexuals, it remains condoned by many gay and lesbian leading North American activists who lobby for the lowering of the age of consent for sex. It is said to be healthy for the boys involved by the self-proclaimed homosexual association NAMBLA (North American Man Boy Love Association). Intergenerational sex (often used euphemism for pederasty) is an undeniable fixture of gay literature, gay films, gay travel and gay prostitution. In the 70's, The Advocate repeatedly ran full page adds for a \"Penetrable boy doll\" and in the 90's, 21% of it's readers admitted having been molested before the age of 15. \n \n Other questions and answers\n Many more studies can be found on the above matters and related ones. Although they are seldom heard in the mainstream Western media, several experts can explain the reality of the homosexual life style, and the consequences to the health of the sexual minority and the self proclaimed real objectives of the homosexual lobby. \n http://www.crin.org/docs/resources/treaties/crc.34/Canada_RW_Update.doc",

I'm pretty sure we've discussed her on here before along with Paul Cameron. There aren't even sources given for these claims. Also, editorial opinions hardly count for much. What else, oh yeah, some travel information for countries which have a lot of child sex, means nothing.\n \n I read these publications, have been for many, many years, and don't see anything about this topic. I guess this must show that pedophilia/child sexuality is an issue specific to the straight community, since the author of this book, published by the University of Minnesota Press, is straight---\n That new book about children and sex is only half as shocking as you've heard. - By Hanna Rosin - Slate Magazine\n \n The book and topic were even discussed in many predominantly straight publications, even my local newspaper.\n \n No, Archangel, you are wrong. It's not reasonable to assume that men who molest boys are gay. Men who molest little girls are not acting on heterosexuality. No one refers to them as \"heterosexual child molestors\". You can't determine whether someone is gay or straight from these criminal actions. If a gay man, who has an adult boyfriend, molested a little girl, would you say that gay man is straight? No, of course you would not.",

Since you are heterosexual, do you have the desire to be naked around females of ANY age?\n\n \n Interesting, because Gene Abel also says this:\n  Based on data from a study of non-incarcerated child sex offenders, Gene G. Abel, M.D., has found that homosexuals \"sexually molest young boys with an incidence that is occurring five times greater than the molestation of girls.\"\n \n A professor of psychiatry who has taught at several medical schools, including Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, Abel is currently affiliated with Emory University School of Medicine and Morehouse School of Medicine. He has been a research scientist in the field of sexual violence for 25 years, and the National Institute of Mental Health has awarded him funding for six long-term studies to investigate sexual violence and to design new ways to stop it.\n \n Specifically, Abel's report provides data to show that, on average, 150.2 boys are molested per homosexual pedophile offender, whereas only 19.8 girls are molested per heterosexual pedophile offender. Incredibly, homosexual offenders admitted between 23.4 and 281.7 acts of molesting boys.\n It also says this:\n Reisman's research in \"Crafting 'Gay' Children\" determined that the total population of homosexual men in America was no more than 2 million in 1991. During the same year, \"U.S. Population, Statistical Abstracts\" show that 6-8 million boys under age 18 had been sexually abused at some time prior to age 18.\n \n Meanwhile, the population of heterosexual men in the U.S. was approximately 86-88 million in 1991, and an estimated eight million girls had been sexually abused at some time prior to age 18.\n \n Based on the government's own statistics -- the \"Statistical Abstract of the United States, 1992, Data on Boys and Girls,\" published by the U.S. Commerce Department -- Reisman cited the following for that year:\n \n Of 86 - 88 million heterosexual men, 9 percent of them victimized 8 million girls under age 18, which constitutes 25 percent of all girls.\n An uncertain percentage of the estimated 2 million homosexual men victimized 6-8 million boys, under age 18, amounting to 17 - 24 percent of all boys.\n Therefore, considered in the aggregate, 3 to 4 boys are sexually molested per homosexual adult male.\n Only .09 girls are sexually molested per heterosexual adult male, which is to say that, on average, 1 in 11 heterosexual males victimizes a girl under 18.\n Within the child protection establishment, sexual abuse is defined simply as an adult having sex with a juvenile under age 18 -- whether \"consensual\" or not. When dealing with children, \"consensual\" is not the legitimizing criterion it is for adults. Indeed, almost invariably, sexual predators defend their \"loving\" physical relationships with children as being \"consensual,\" when in reality the seduction and manipulation of children -- resulting in their \"consent\" -- is both an art form and the stock in trade of pedophiles.\n The Simon and Schuster book \"Homosexualities,\" by Alan Bell, reports that 25 percent of homosexual men admit to having had sex with boys who are 16 or under.\n And there's more...\n \n Further corroborating this well-hidden homosexual proclivity for targeting younger males are the following findings published in the Journal of the American Medical Association:\n \n 50 percent of male AIDS victims reported having sex with an adult male by the age of 16.\n 20 percent of male AIDS victims had sex with an adult male by age 10.\n \"The Advocate,\" a popular homosexual newsmagazine, conducted a survey of its readers. Of the 2,500 responses obtained, 21 percent admitted that an adult man committed a sexual act with them by the time they were 15.\n Rape of a sacred trust\n \n You see, what is undeniable is that with a homosexual population of between 2 and 4% of the overall society, and such a large percentage of boys being molested, with absolutely no real evidence that straight men sexually abuse boys rather than their natural preference, girls. By the very definition, men who are attracted to other males are homosexual. To then imply that most of these men sexually abusing boys are then heterosexuals belies common sense and reality. I really don't care what one study suggests when we have real world examples which say the opposite is true. Examples which are outlined in this article.",

   "Molestation and rape are not crimes of passion - they are violence. Victims are chosen based perceived vulnerability - not because they turn you on.\n \n This is really, really, really low Archangel. As a victim of rape I am offended that you detract from what my rape was.\n\n \n Are you suggesting that homosexual child molesters are incapable of projecting those characteristics jito? Exactly what in your statement, assuming it is 100% factual in all cases exonerates homosexuals pedophiles from fitting that profile? \n \n In addition, how is this debate detracting from your personal experience? In fact, as a female, this debate doesn't even apply to your situation since nobody is suggesting you were raped by a homosexual. So of what value is this rant since it is completely out of bounds of what is being discussed here? \n \n These people would have us believe that straight men are motivated to sexually molest boys when that assumption and claim is ridiculous based on everything we know about human sexuality. But to the apologists for the homosexual PC police, they believe they can make any ludicrous claim and unless we can show signed confessions from every molester out there that they are homosexual, then to the apologist it is fine assuming they are straight men doing this no matter how incredible a claim it is and how much it flies in the face of reason and known human sexual expression.\n \n Remember my thread about the indoctrination of students in public schools through these programs? Well, here is another quote from my link above which clarifies just how this is a part of the homosexual agenda. Read it and weep Jito, and then get enraged since the truth of what is happening to our children so offends you. Too bad what's happening to the children doesn't offend your side though, but that would require a moral center, wouldn't it!\n The 'helping hand' \n In Gilbert Herdt's book, \"Gay and Lesbian Youth,\" Douglas Feldman, a medical anthropologist and a member of the homosexual activist community, is quoted as saying, \"These kids are our future and we must invest in them.\" Feldman states that teen-agers are \"very susceptible to sexually transmitted diseases,\" and that sexually abused boys \"have about a 1 in 4 chance of developing AIDS in approximately five years.\"\n \n Herdt speaks of adult male homosexuals as \"coaches\" and \"guides\" who should help young boys overcome their heterosexual \"victim\" status by \"coming out\" into homosexuality.\n \n Reisman blames the nation's public schools and lawmakers for granting various protections to such \"coaches\" and \"guides\" within the nation's schools.\n \n \"They teach confused children about tolerance, sexual diversity and such. They like to tell young boys that 'at least one in 10 of you are gay.' Anyone who objects is immediately labeled homophobic,\" she said.\n \n In his study, \"The Role of Adult Advisors\" (as quoted from Herdt's \"Gay Culture in America\"), homosexual advocate Frederick Lynch says, \"What has not been brought out fully in some other coming-out studies is the role of the guide, teacher or 'helping hand' in either the signification state, the coming-out stage or both ... the often benign and helpful role that older, more experienced homosexual men play with regard to younger (males).\"\n \n Reisman is concerned that educators have embraced the homosexual agenda and now encourage boys to have sex with each other at an early age. One of the places such experimentation could easily take place is in a tent during a Boy Scout camping trip, she said. Boys who have been told that experimentation is acceptable may also be willing to accept the advances of an adult male or older boy, she added.\n \n \"They tell these impressionable kids that if they feel different, confused, strange, or if they are questioning, that they may be gay,\" she said. \"What child isn't confused at that age, anyway? These kids don't know what to think, and then they're told it's OK to experiment to find out.\"",

   "Interesting, because Gene Abel also says this:\n  Based on data from a study of non-incarcerated child sex offenders, Gene G. Abel, M.D., has found that homosexuals \"sexually molest young boys with an incidence that is occurring five times greater than the molestation of girls.\"\n \n A professor of psychiatry who has taught at several medical schools, including Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, Abel is currently affiliated with Emory University School of Medicine and Morehouse School of Medicine. He has been a research scientist in the field of sexual violence for 25 years, and the National Institute of Mental Health has awarded him funding for six long-term studies to investigate sexual violence and to design new ways to stop it.\n \n Specifically, Abel's report provides data to show that, on average, 150.2 boys are molested per homosexual pedophile offender, whereas only 19.8 girls are molested per heterosexual pedophile offender. Incredibly, homosexual offenders admitted between 23.4 and 281.7 acts of molesting boys.\n\n \n That's garbage, Archangel. The study I posted said: \n \n \nwhen we excluded the men in our study who molested both boys and girls, the remaining subjects reported a total number of boy victims that was 40 percent of the number of girl victims.\n\n \n There is no such thing as \"homosexual offenders\", as I have shown. Most men who molest boys are heterosexual. Which gay-hating site are you getting this from? Care to post a source?\n \n \nIt also says this:\n\n \n What says it? Your anti-gay poropaganda trash site?\n \n \nReisman's research in \"Crafting 'Gay' Children\" determined that the total population of homosexual men in America was no more than 2 million in 1991. During the same year, \"U.S. Population, Statistical Abstracts\" show that 6-8 million boys under age 18 had been sexually abused at some time prior to age 18.\n \n Meanwhile, the population of heterosexual men in the U.S. was approximately 86-88 million in 1991, and an estimated eight million girls had been sexually abused at some time prior to age 18.\n \n Based on the government's own statistics -- the \"Statistical Abstract of the United States, 1992, Data on Boys and Girls,\" published by the U.S. Commerce Department -- Reisman cited the following for that year:\n \n Of 86 - 88 million heterosexual men, 9 percent of them victimized 8 million girls under age 18, which constitutes 25 percent of all girls.\n An uncertain percentage of the estimated 2 million homosexual men victimized 6-8 million boys, under age 18, amounting to 17 - 24 percent of all boys.\n Therefore, considered in the aggregate, 3 to 4 boys are sexually molested per homosexual adult male.\n Only .09 girls are sexually molested per heterosexual adult male, which is to say that, on average, 1 in 11 heterosexual males victimizes a girl under 18.\n Within the child protection establishment, sexual abuse is defined simply as an adult having sex with a juvenile under age 18 -- whether \"consensual\" or not. When dealing with children, \"consensual\" is not the legitimizing criterion it is for adults. Indeed, almost invariably, sexual predators defend their \"loving\" physical relationships with children as being \"consensual,\" when in reality the seduction and manipulation of children -- resulting in their \"consent\" -- is both an art form and the stock in trade of pedophiles.\n The Simon and Schuster book \"Homosexualities,\" by Alan Bell, reports that 25 percent of homosexual men admit to having had sex with boys who are 16 or under.\n\n \n Well, something's wrong there. As my source, and others show, girls are molested at a rate much higher than boys. Also, as has been established, men who molest boys are overwhelmingly heterosexual. And here we go again with that one survey from Alan Bell about \"having had\" sex with boys who are 16(I thought it was 17) or under. At any rate, it's talking about people who have at any time, had sex as teenagers. Meaning two gay teenagers could have sex with each other(not uncommon in the straight community amongst teens), and be asked the question years later, responding in the affirmative. \n \n \n \n \nAnd there's more...\n \n Further corroborating this well-hidden homosexual proclivity for targeting younger males are the following findings published in the Journal of the American Medical Association:\n \n 50 percent of male AIDS victims reported having sex with an adult male by the age of 16.\n 20 percent of male AIDS victims had sex with an adult male by age 10.\n \"The Advocate,\" a popular homosexual newsmagazine, conducted a survey of its readers. Of the 2,500 responses obtained, 21 percent admitted that an adult man committed a sexual act with them by the time they were 15.\n Rape of a sacred trust\n\n \n Yeah, garbage. Let's survey only heterosexuals who have sexual diseases, and generalize the sample to suggest it applies to all heterosexuals. That's what you are doing with homosexuals, and it is 100% WRONG! And where is the source for this Advocate article, I'd like to see it in context. The readers of a particular magazine are not necessarily a generalizable sample. Let's only interview straight women who read Cosmo, and see the results we get. Please. \n \n \nYou see, what is undeniable is that with a homosexual population of between 2 and 4% of the overall society, and such a large percentage of boys being molested, with absolutely no real evidence that straight men sexually abuse boys rather than their natural preference, girls.\n\n \n I've shown you the evidence! Are you this silly? Do you lie purposely?\n \n \nBy the very definition, men who are attracted to other males are homosexual.\n\n \n The definition of homosexuality doesn't include the attraction of an adult to a child.\n \n \nTo then imply that most of these men sexually abusing boys are then heterosexuals belies common sense and reality. I really don't care what one study suggests when we have real world examples which say the opposite is true. Examples which are outlined in this article.\n\n \n Yes, I know you don't care about what an actual study, posted in full, says. That's the problem. What are these \"real world\" examples? I have shown real world examples which prove my point, and dismiss yours.",

   "The studies that Archie quotes do the same thing over and OVER and OVER again.\n They assume that if a man molests a boy, that must mean the man is gay.\n That is a false assumption, as multiple research items prove.\n \n Study #1\n In 1978 psychologist Nicholas Groth screened 175 men who had been convicted in Massachusetts of sexual molestation of children and referred by a court for psychological evaluation. He found not a single gay man in this sample. Every one of the perpetrators was either an exclusive heterosexual, a bisexual with a predominantly heterosexual orientation, or a fixated pedophile with no sexual interest in adults.[4]\n \n His conclusion? That \"the adult heterosexual male constitutes a greater risk to the underage child than does the adult homosexual male.\"\n Playing the Pedophilia Card\n ================================================== ===\n Study #2\n \n In the same year, researcher David Newton reviewed the scientific literature and found no reason to believe that anything other than a \"random connection\" existed between homosexual orientation and child molestation.[5]\n Playing the Pedophilia Card\n ================================================== ===\n Study #3\n \n In 1988, renowned sex researcher Kurt Freund at the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry in Toronto studied two groups of paid volunteers and found that gay men responded no more to male child stimuli than heterosexual men responded to female child stimuli.[6] He later described as a \"myth\" the notion that gay men are more likely than straight men to be child molesters.[7]\n Playing the Pedophilia Card \n ================================================== ===\n Study #4\n \n In 1992, alarmed over claims made during a campaign for an anti-gay state constitutional amendment in Colorado, two physicians reviewed every case of suspected child molestation evaluated at Children's Hospital in Denver over a one-year period. Of the 269 cases determined to involve molestation by an adult, only two of the perpetrators could be identified as gay or lesbian. The researchers concluded that the risk of child sexual abuse by an identifiably gay or lesbian person was between zero and 3.1%, and that the risk of such abuse by the heterosexual partner of a relative was over 100 times greater.[8]\n Playing the Pedophilia Card\n ================================================== ===\n Study #5\n \n A 1994 study found that &#8220;a child&#8217;s risk of being molest ed by his or her relative&#8217;s heterosexual partner is 100 times greater than by someone who might be identified as a homosexual.

In one study of 269 cases of child sexual abuse, only two offenders were gay or lesbian. Of the cases studied involving molestation of a boy by a man, 74 percent of the men were or had been in a heterosexual relationship with the boy's mother or another female relative. The study concluded that \"a child's risk of being molested by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is over 100 times greater than by someone who might be identifiable as being homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual.\"10 \n http://archive.aclu.org/issues/gay/parent.html \n ================================================== ===\n \n General Note:\n \n The American Psychological Association, the National Association of Social Workers, the American Academy of Child Psychiatrists and the Child Welfare League of America all have policy statements stating there is no correlation between homosexuality and child abuse. \n \n When asked about this question, the American Psychiatric Association wrote to the Senate stating: &#8220;While we are all concerned by the issu of sexual abuse, there is no credible evidence that lesbians and gay men are more likely to commit such offenses than others.

They really are straight - they're responding to the feminine qualities of pre-pubescent boys, qualities that gay men didn't find appealing. After all, gay men are, by definition, attracted to men; the feminine characteristics of young boys were a turn-off to them.\n \n Testing The Premise: Are Gays A Threat To Our Children?\n\n \n Interestingly, your link also says this, below, Jake. It points out that A lot of people behave homosexually without being among the three percent who identify themselves as gay. In fact, when it comes to homosexual behavior, this three percent is barely scratching the surface. This would explain these male child molesters who prey on boys in a rational and common sense manner since we know that to claim that straight men are attracted to boys because of their femininity is making impractical conclusions which defy logic.\n \n This also answers foundits apologist studies which seek to make male on male child molestation a straight mans issue. The fact remains that it is irrational to conclude that men who are damaged enough to molest children would be straight men by sexual inclination and yet prefer to molest boys rather than girls. Just as we don't see homosexuals molesting girls, it is irrational and unreasonable that straight men molest boys. It is more reasonable to conclude that these men are either lying to the study and themselves or just in denial of their true nature due to machismo and embarrassment. \n \n The reason why we will never agree on this is because it requires common sense in applying known sexual proclivities to the acts being attributed to these offenders. the homosexual apologists prefer to manipulate the natural proclivities of straight men in order to indict them for the high number of young male victims since homosexuals make up such a small percentage of the population. They know how damming the statistics look for their community if it is admitted that all male child victims of sexual molestation come from within the homosexual community. And please remember, I said in my first post that I'm not making a blanked indictment here about all homosexuals. That would be unfair and ludicrous in my opinion. But I will reject just as strongly that it is straight men who are molesting little boys as that defies logic and the natural sexual preferences of those men. It is more reasonable to conclude that these emotionally and sexually damaged offenders are lying to themselves and those around them regarding their true sexual proclivities, and that they are in fact homosexuals/bisexuals who are living a persona as straight men which your own link concludes is a rational assumption based on the evidence. \n How Many Homosexuals Are There?\n We know that the proportion of self-described gay men in the general population is very small - certainly much smaller than the one-sixth to one-third of children abused children who are male victims of adult men. Many gay rights opponents place the proportion of self-described gay men quite low, around 1-3%. But most large-population surveys support something higher than 3%.17, 18 For the sake of this discussion, we'll accept 3%.\n \n What does this mean? Well, let's say we've gathered 10,000 adults in a stadium and asked them one simple yes-or-no question: \"Are you gay?\" If our 3% figure is correct, only 300 people in that stadium will answer \"yes,\" with the remaining 9,700 saying \"no.\" This much is pretty obvious.\n \n And for someone who answers \"yes\" to that question, what would we know about him or her? Again, most people would think this answer is pretty obvious as well. If he's a man, that means he dates other men, he is sexually attracted to other men, and because he is comfortable enough to answer \"yes\" to a stranger with a clipboard, he is probably known by his family, friends and neighbors as being gay.\n \n And you can draw the same conclusions for a woman who answers \"yes\" as well: she dates other women, is attracted to other women, and is confident enough to say so when asked. In other words, visibly \"out\" gay men and women are typically the ones who answer \"yes\" to this question in surveys.\n \n And how do we know that this three percent mostly represents those who are \"out\"? Well, a recent online survey by Harris Interactive asked them exactly that. Those who identified themselves as gay reported that 92% are out to their close friends, 78% are out to their parents, 68% are out to other relatives, acquaintances and to casual friends, and 66% are out to co-workers.19\n \n What's more, many surveys show that this three percent does not include everyone who is behaving homosexually. Not only does this figure often exclude bisexuals, it also excludes those who don't identify themselves as gay for any number of reasons - even though they may admit to engaging in same-sex sexual contact.\n \n According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 57% of men who had sex with another man did not consider themselves to be homosexual or bisexual.20 A recent random survey of 4,193 men in New York City revealed that while 91.3% claimed they were straight, 9.3% of those \"straight\" respondents had sex only with other men in the previous year, while another 0.8% reported having sex with both men and women.21 When the authors included gays and bisexuals, they noted that among men who have sex with men, 73% identified as straight. Another representative survey found that more than 20% of all men have had a homosexual experience.22\n \n And remember - these figures are all based on what these men voluntarily admit to doing. Who knows how many others refuse to acknowledge their sexual activity when asked for these surveys.\n \n It's important to keep in mind exactly who we're talking about when we're discussing this three percent. A lot of people behave homosexually without being among the three percent who identify themselves as gay. In fact, when it comes to homosexual behavior, this three percent is barely scratching the surface.",

   "Interestingly, your link also says this, below, Jake. It points out that A lot of people behave homosexually without being among the three percent who identify themselves as gay. In fact, when it comes to homosexual behavior, this three percent is barely scratching the surface.\n\n While this is true, this does not address the research done on \"men who HAVE sex with men and/or women, and molest boys\".\n In Jake's study, this is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT section which Archie is trying to confuse with the overall research. Archie is trying to use this ONE SEPARATE section to make false claims about the other study, IGNORING THE DETAILS of the other study.\n \n \n \nThis would explain these male child molesters who prey on boys in a rational and common sense manner since we know that to claim that straight men are attracted to boys because of their femininity is making impractical conclusions which defy logic.\n\n \"making impractical conclusions which defy logic \"???\n :xbanghead\n There is no such conclusion that can be drawn!\n \n The facts were shown. Archie doesn't want to acknowledge that these items could be true, so he automatically disregards them WITHOUT REASON, and calls it \"defying logic\".\n \n If you LOOK at the studies on CHILD MOLESTATION, they are specific.\n \"Of 50 male children, 37 (74%) were molested by men who had been in a heterosexual relationship with the child&#8217;s relative. Three were molested by women, five were molested by both parents, and three others were molested by non-relatives. Only one perpetrator could be identified as being possibly homosexual in his adult behavior.23 \"\n \n These studies look at WHICH ADULTS the molestors slept with.\n This completely bypasses Archie's \"self-identified as gay\" complaint cause it DOES NOT MATTER how these people identified. The study was CAREFUL enough to look at the sexual past of these people.\n \n \n \nThis also answers foundits apologist studies which seek to make male on male child molestation a straight mans issue.\n\n NO. It does not Archie.\n The studies I talked about looked at WHICH ADULTS the molestors had sex with.\n Considering your argument, this BYPASSES what you are talking about cause IT DOES NOT MATTER how the molestor \"identifies\" when the researchers look at WHICH ADULTS THE MOLESTORS sleep with.\n \n \n \nThe fact remains that it is irrational to conclude that men who are damaged enough to molest children would be straight men by sexual inclination and yet prefer to molest boys rather than girls.\n\n :xbanghead :xbanghead\n Archie, we're talking about DAMAGED people in the first place.\n Your big problem appears that you would prefer to listen to people who are RENOWNED for being anti-gay and misrepresenting research, over organizations like the APA.\n \n \n \nJust as we don't see homosexuals molesting girls, it is irrational and unreasonable that straight men molest boys. It is more reasonable to conclude that these men are either lying to the study and themselves or just in denial of their true nature due to machismo and embarrassment. \n\n Archie shows absolutely no evidence for any of these assumptions, yet demands we accept them all cause he can't fathom the world not being as he wants it to be...\n \n \n \nThe reason why we will never agree on this is because it requires common sense in applying known sexual proclivities to the acts being attributed to these offenders.\n\n No. We will probably never agree.\n Furthermore, I find it amusing that on MY side, the research actually did the due diligence to INVESTIGATE which gender the molestor was having adult sex with. On your side, it is simply ASSUMED.\n \n The people who aren't looking to slur gays will have no problem listening to the COMMON research put out by the APA and other nationally recognized professional organizations.\n \n People like you who are interested in slurring gays will only listen to the people who are like you. You will listen to the people who are shown to misrepresent the research.\n Earlier, I pointed out that YOUR RESEARCHERS misrepresented the work of Dr Eugene Abel. He NEVER said what your guy claimed.\n Yet AGAIN, you fail to admit that you have quoted something proven inaccurate, and you stick to it...\n :xbanghead\n At least you're consistent... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nthe homosexual apologists prefer to manipulate the natural proclivities of straight men in order to indict them for the high number of young male victims since homosexuals make up such a small percentage of the population.\n\n \"homosexual apologists\"?\n If we could have an HONEST analysis of each sides' resources, it would go like this...\n On OUR side, you can look at the people involved and their history. Typically, the people who conducted the research are NOT gay. They don't do \"gay\" research in general. The research in general was done by people who were researching CHILD MOLESTATION, and that was their primary focus.\n \n On Archie's side, you can look at the people involved and their history. Typically, Archie's resources are RENOWNED for making a living of being anti-gay. Furthermore, they typically don't do their own research, but rather misrepresent the research of others (like I have shown Dr Eugene Abel's research was misrepresented). The proclivities on Archie's side can be shown to be dubious in a LONG LIST of ways (like with Reisman's history).\n \n Yet Archie has the gall to criticize our experts for what he calls \"homosexual apologist\", with little to no analysis done beyond that.\n Again, par for Archie's course...",

And I will post a verse that explains that our battle is a spiritual one rather than physical. And truthfully speaking TQ, any further explanation for you would be a waste of time as you will only mock the concept that demons influence both peoples actions and world events. You are completely blind to the fact that they have control over every unsaved person alive in different degrees.\n Eph 6:12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age,* against spiritual [hosts] of wickedness in the heavenly [places].\n \n Here are 3 more verses that speak to the spiritual battle we are in.\n \n Ephesians 2:2 in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.\n \n Ephesians 3:10 so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places.\n \n Colossians 1:13 For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son, (NASB \u00a91995)\n \n Here are more references to the power and influence of principalities. Rom 8:38,39, Col 2:15, 1Pe 3:22\n \n I stand by this post and challenge you to show that it isn't perfectly in line with spiritual principles. \n \n Just so you know though, principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age,* against spiritual [hosts] of wickedness in the heavenly [places] \n \n prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. These are direct references to the battle between Gods Angels and fallen Angels, or demons as we commonly refer to them. You know, the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. \n \n Here are more direct references to the works of demons and their removal from their victims.\n Mar 16:9 Now when [He] rose early on the first [day] of the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven demons.\n Mar 16:17 And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues;\n Luk 4:41 And demons also came out of many, crying out and saying, \"You are the Christ, the Son of God!\" And He, rebuking [them], did not allow them to speak, for they knew that He was the Christ.\n Luk 8:2 and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities--Mary called Magdalene, out of whom had come seven demons,\n Wasn't Mary Magdalene the prostitute whom Jesus rescued from being stoned to death? See the connection tq? Weird isn't it that Jesus also cast out 7 demons from her? And that she followed Him from that time forth? This is why I needed you to quote the actual post. So I could show that I'm not off the wall as you attempted to paint me to be. That my statement is in line with spiritual principles. Now your contention is NOT with me, but it is the bible itself which you stand against. So good luck with that battle my shallow friend. emoticon_xgood\n \n And here is tq's insulting and emotional follow up post to the above response and my reply to him. http://www.4forums.com/political/315064-post41.html Just to keep the record straight, of course. :)",

And I posted evidence above whic confirms that attraction to young men and boys is rampant in the homosexual community. \n \n You might have an argument in your favor if, oh let's say that the founder of NAMBLA was a straight man. But you can't go there because he isn't, and that organization was built with a homosexual membership which was only rejected by the larger homosexual community because it painted too large a target on the whole community. But if you'll notice, the larger community has never been able to deconstruct NAMBLA. It still exists and still gets its members from the homosexual community.

There is a definite percentage of the straight population who do this based on some sexual aberration which exists within them. I make no excuses for them, nor do I feel responsible for their lack of control or their unnatural sexual urges. Why you have a hard time accepting the reality that some homosexuals are attracted to young boys, and why you take it personally as if it reflects on you somehow, defies reason.

But it was real, and very tempting for a horny 21 year old who lived and breathed through his out of control hormones. And regarding the bolded, that is exactly what got me through without submitting to my urges to ravage that magnificent girl who turned me on at every level of my being. You see Jake, this happened at 21 years old, like I said; but I got saved at 22 years old, a year later. So I had no spiritually held moral convictions to rely on at all. I was acting purely in the flesh and it was my fear of legal repercussions which prevented me from going all the way with her. The point was that I had the ability to refrain.

Why you have a hard time accepting the reality that some homosexuals are attracted to young boys, and why you take it personally as if it reflects on you somehow, defies reason.

It's the result of having that \"aberration\", as you called it.\n \n \nI haven't been shown any real evidence at all Jake.

So I had no spiritually held moral convictions to rely on at all. I was acting purely in the flesh and it was my fear of legal repercussions which prevented me from going all the way with her. The point was that I had the ability to refrain. Sexual Narcissists don't. And if you knew me back then, you would realize how big a moral victory that night was for me. emoticon_xlove\n\n \n So what was it, the religion or the fear of authority, or both?

It exposes your need to exaggerate and outright lie about what I said in order to insult me and make me appear to be some sort of crazy whacko. You made the blanket statement above that you quoted my precise words, yet you told Jito that I said this: You're forgetting-this is the guy who stated that gays are possessed by demons, which are invited in by masturbation, and that these demons make gays molest kids so they can be \"passed on\" to the kids.\n \n In reposting my original statement below which you produced, or this post, Please show where I ever mentioned masturbation or that all gays molest kids? You completely misrepresented my scripturally and spiritually supported/documented statement by attempting to attack my sanity. Below is your fallacious and dishonest assertion of what I originally said, and my original statement for all to see so your dishonesty in presenting my opinion is documented for all to see.\n \n I also stated clearly that the forces of spiritual darkness had influence in the lives of all unregenerate people, as I said here: You are completely blind to the fact that they have control over every unsaved person alive in different degrees. So mine was a blanket statement regarding the spiritual battle which humanity is involved in whether they are aware of it or not, (which you obviously are completely blind to) But your post to Jito attempted to apply it only to homosexuals which is another distortion of what I actually said which my quoted response below also proves.\n \n That is why I asked you to document my original post for proper content and context so I could show that you dishonestly mangled what I said in order to attack my sanity.

Let's look at that article you posted:\n \n \"However, these spirits can be transmitted to children, especially if someone who had this demonic spirit seduced or raped a child--or even if they were close to gay people. These demons can also be imparted to others through unholy sexual acts.\n \n People become homosexuals because they yield to abnormal acts or lust. It is through some source that they have received a demonic spirit that drives them to their lust. Viewing evil videos or pornographic books is a way of opening the door for Satan to give one an evil, perverse spirit.\"\n \n Are you actually going to try and defend this idiocy that you posted in defence of your beliefs from an \"honest and objective\" source?\n [Archangels response:] Yes, I absolutely do defend it. And I will post verses that explain that our battle is a spiritual one rather than physical. And truthfully speaking TQ, any further explanation for you would be a waste of time as you will only mock the concept that demons influence both peoples actions and world events. You are completely blind to the fact that they have control over every unsaved person alive in different degrees. \n Eph 6:12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age,* against spiritual [hosts] of wickedness in the heavenly [places].\n \n Here are 3 more verses that speak to the spiritual battle we are in.\n \n Ephesians 2:2 in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.\n \n Ephesians 3:10 so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places.\n \n Colossians 1:13 For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son, (NASB \u00a91995)\n \n Here are more references to the power and influence of principalities.

Do you know the leader of the Ku Klux Klan is a Christian? You might have an arugment that there's no link between Christianity and racism, if that organization didn't exist. Do you know that atheists are underrepresented in the prison system? Do you know that fundamentalist Mormons, like the ones who molest young girls, are heterosexual and Christian? \n\n \n Your attempts to change the subject and detract from the issue at hand will not work Jake. Let's stay on track and attempt to stay with what is known about the agenda and history of the homosexual involvement with legalizing sex with boys and destroying age of consent laws.\n NAMBLA And\n Homosexual Activism\n \n \n Pedophiles And Homosexual Activists Push For Total Sexual Liberation\n \n In August, 2003, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against the state of Kansas over the state's criminal sodomy law involving children. The ACLU is defending Matthew Limon, a homosexual who committed sodomy against a 14-year-old boy in 2000. At the time of his crime, Simon was 18 years old. The ACLU is claiming that Limon's conviction is unconstitutionally discriminatory because the penalties for sodomy with a minor are different than for heterosexual sex with a minor.\n \n Kansas Attorney General Phill KIine says the fairness of Limon's sentence should be a state legislative issue, not a constitutional one. According to Kline, \"If the ACLU wins in the thrust of their arguments, it means the state has no right to say that it is illegal for an adult to have sex with a 13-year-old child.\" Kline also fears that an ACLU victory will make it difficult for the state to enforce laws against polygamy, incest, bestiality, and other sexual perversions.\n \n The effort to abolish \"age of consent\" laws has been a long-time goal of homosexual activists. The 1972 Gay Rights Platform, for example, called for the abolition of all laws prohibiting sex with children. The platform demands: \"Repeal of all laws governing the age of sexual consent.\"\n \n In September, 1995, three homosexual activists published an essay entitled, \"The State Of Gay Liberation\" in Guide, a homosexual publication. The essay was authored by North American Man Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) co-founder David Thorstad, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Professor Richard D. Mohr, and San Francisco journalist Bruce Mirken.\n \n Thorstad, of course, is a life-long pederast and homosexual activist who clearly describes the important linkage between homosexuality and pedophilia. In a speech given before a homosexual group in Mexico in 1998, Thorstad said: \"Pederasty is the main form that male homosexuality has acquired throughout Western civilization-and not only in the West! Pederasty is inseparable from the high points of Western culture-ancient Greece and the Renaissance.\" (David Thorstad, \"Pederasty And Homosexuality,\" NAMBLA web site)\n \n Fellow author Professor Richard Mohr, is a homosexual activist who is an advocate for same-sex marriage and has said he hopes that homosexual marriage will help define \"monogamy\" out of marriage altogether. (Stanley Kurtz, \"Beyond Gay Marriage,\" The Weekly Standard, Aug. 4-11, 2003)\n \n Bruce Mirken is a homosexual and San Francisco journalist who was arrested in 1998 for attempting to have sex with a 13-year-old boy he had contacted through the Internet. When he entered a Sacramento park to sodomize the boy, he was met by police who had been tracking his activities on the Internet. The charges were eventually dropped against him on a technicality.\n \n Sexual Liberation For Children\n \n Thorstad and Professor Mohr want sexual liberation for children and Mirken believes that AIDS activism is what will help perpetuate and strengthen the homosexual movement.\n \n According to David Thorstad, in \"The State Of Gay Liberation,\" homosexuals must get back to a \"radical vision of sexual freedom for all. We need to reaffirm our place in the great variety of same-sex behaviors that exist-have always existed-in human societies. We dare not allow our homosexual gift to be alienated from us by the limited vision, stifling political correctness, and erotophobic provincialism.\" In short, homosexuals should openly support the promotion of adult/child sex!\n \n Professor Mohr argues that the use of \"gay youth\" is a key to gaining political and cultural victories in the U.S. He writes: \"...these brave youth are key to culture's change on gay issues. Thanks to them, increasingly people know someone for whom being gay is an issue. Thanks to them the gay movement is achieving critical mass.\" Bruce Mirken claims that radical AIDS activism is what will save the homosexual movement from decline.\n \n The effort to push adult/child sex isn't limited to these three homosexual activists. It is part of the overall homosexual movement. As author Mary Eberstadt wrote in \"Pedophilia Chic: Reconsidered\" in The Weekly Standard, (Jan. 1, 2001): \"The reason why the public is being urged to reconsider boy pedophilia is that this 'question,' settled though it may be in the opinions and laws of the rest of the country, is demonstrably not yet settled within certain parts of the gay rights movement.\" Eberstadt notes that as the homosexual movement becomes more mainstream, this \"question\" about adult/child sex will become more prominent. Homosexuals who desire sex with children will do exactly what the ACLU is doing in Kansas: Destroy all laws banning sex between adults and children.Exposed: Homosexual Urban Legend: NAMBLA And Homosexual Activism\n \n These are historically documented facts which can be independently verified. This isn't me attacking anyone but merely exposing the hidden agenda of the homosexual community which denies support for NAMBLA publicly, but supports them and their agenda in any way they can. The whole piece is very damming but feel free to prove any of it wrong on a point by point basis.\n \n \nWhere do terrorists get their recruits, Archangel? It's from Middle-Eastern immigrants, of which you are one. NAMBLA gets it's recruits from all over. I don't see the word gay nor the word homosexual in their name at all. There are pedophiles part of online groups all over these days, and its members are not in NAMBLA. Watch the news at all?\n\n \n More attempts to deny reality and change the subject Jake. And I feel no need to defend against anything you say here.\n \n \nYou say some heterosexuals WITH AN ABERRATION. THE KEY WORD IS: \"ABERRATION\". THAT OBVIOUSLY DOES NOT REFER TO HETEROSEXUALITY ITSELF. HOWEVER, YOU ARE LINKING HOMOSEXUALITY ITSELF. THAT IS WRONG.emoticon_xbanghead\n \n \n Sure it does. hetero child molesters are an aberration of heterosexuality just as homosexual child molesters are an aberration of homosexuality. What I am maintaining though is that it is homosexuals which are attracted to boys while heterosexual deviants are attracted to girls. That is the crux of the point I'm defending which you refuse to admit to. \n \n \nHAVE YOU GONE MAD, ARCHANGEL? WHERE HAVE I DEFENDED PEDOPHILIA OR CHILD MOLESTATION?! I'VE DONE THE EXACT OPPOSITE.\n\n \n Man are you ultra sensitive Jake. Show where I said you were defending pedophelia? I said you are defending against it being a very real practice and preference within the gay community. That isn't a personal indictment of your acceptance of it as right or good at all.\n \n \nI've never said no homosexuals are attracted to young kids, just that it's not because of homosexuality itself. It's the result of having that \"aberration\", as you called it.\n\n \n On this point I will agree. But just as the aberration exists within the hetero community with an attraction to young girls, so does it exist within the homosexual community with an attraction for young boys. That's my point and my only issue here which you seem anathema to accept. \n \n \nSo what was it, the religion or the fear of authority, or both? You bolded religion too, but then say you weren't saved until a year later. You crow about it, because you're a hypocrite.\n\n \n As I said Jake, and again you seem unwilling or unable to grasp it. I wasn't a believer in Christ when this occurred. So my current spiritual convictions had no bearing on that night or that experience in any way. I was just a horny kid who had one goal on his mind that night, and that was to get laid. The moral of that story was my ability to refrain from acting on those powerful hormonal impulses with a girl who seemed mature enough on every level of my immature considerations that night to have sex with, and who wanted to have sex. Sexual perverts and Narcissists have no such proclivity or ability to refrain from doing that which they know is illegal and morally wrong.",

So he will attempt to discredit me without even attempting to refute the evidence. So since you can't refute these facts: http://www.traditionalvalues.org/urban/nine.phphow about these made by Father David Trosch about homosexual priests and the abuse scandal which has plagued the American church?\n On Homosexuals in the Catholic Priesthood\n Pedophile Protection Observations \n \n \n In a conversation with a well qualified school teacher who is a convert to Catholicism, she stated that she believes that as many as 75% of priests may be homosexual. Later, in consideration of what she had said, I reflected upon a number of priests in the archdiocese and had to admit the possibility that a high percentage of them might at least be homosexually oriented. I told her that I had considered the possibility that 40% of priests might be homosexual but found it hard to believe that the numbers she suggested could be correct. In using the term homosexual I am not distinguishing between those who are chaste and those who are active / practicing homosexuals.\n \n Shortly after ordination I had reflected that it would be terrible that if as many as 2% of priests were homosexual. Perhaps a year later in a conversation with a highly placed priest of the archdiocese he stated that approximately 35% of priests were homosexuals. It was most disconcerting to read the following article in which Fr. Cozzens, the head of a Catholic seminary, says that estimates range as high as 60% of American priests are homosexual.\n \n Unfortunately the article states that, \"Cozzens is not against ordaining gay men, and concedes some effective bishops and even some popes may have been gay.\"\n \n I totally disagree with his position of not being against ordaining gay men. I personally believe that it should be incorporated into the Code of Canon Law that homosexual orientation invalidates ordination, that is, makes homosexual orientation a diriment impediment to ordination. I further believe that an active homosexual cleric or religious (including pedophiles) should incur a totally reserved automatic excommunication that remains unforgivable while remaining in such position. Such sin would be a permanent impediment in regard to returning to religious life.\n \n While the expulsion of active homosexuals would possibly, even probably, cause a significant temporary decline in the number of available priests, I believe that in the long run the Church would have a great increase in vocations with a correspondingly healthier priesthood and consequently a morally healthier Church and world.\n \n Father David C.

But which of us is mentally ill remains to be seen and proven. \n =========================================================================================================\n \n \n \nSoooo, how exactly is me quoting your precise words, and you stating you agree that yes, gays are evil, posessed by demons, and that you can \"catch gay\" by exposure proving me wrong here Archie?\n \n You claimed you never said the above. I post the link to the very post that you did this in (which, for some reason you decided to re-post), and then you state that proves that you didn't say what you quoted yourself saying?\n \n FFS Archie, go see a psychiatrist already!\n\n \n The fact is that I never did say what you dishonestly attributed to me above in your post to Jito. It exposes your need to exaggerate and outright lie about what I said in order to insult me and make me appear to be some sort of crazy whacko. You made the blanket statement above that you quoted my precise words, yet you told Jito that I said this: You're forgetting-this is the guy who stated that gays are possessed by demons, which are invited in by masturbation, and that these demons make gays molest kids so they can be \"passed on\" to the kids.\n \n In reposting my original statement below which you produced, or this post, Please show where I ever mentioned masturbation or that all gays molest kids? You completely misrepresented my scripturally and spiritually supported/documented statement by attempting to attack my sanity. Below is your fallacious and dishonest assertion of what I originally said, and my original statement for all to see so your dishonesty in presenting my opinion is documented for all to see.\n \n I also stated clearly that the forces of spiritual darkness had influence in the lives of all unregenerate people, as I said here: You are completely blind to the fact that they have control over every unsaved person alive in different degrees. So mine was a blanket statement regarding the spiritual battle which humanity is involved in whether they are aware of it or not, (which you obviously are completely blind to) But your post to Jito attempted to apply it only to homosexuals which is another distortion of what I actually said which my quoted response below also proves.\n \n That is why I asked you to document my original post for proper content and context so I could show that you dishonestly mangled what I said in order to attack my sanity. I have affectively defended my original statement while exposing your inability to properly interpret or define what I said in that debate. \n \n \nYou're forgetting-this is the guy who stated that gays are possessed by demons, which are invited in by masturbation, and that these demons make gays molest kids so they can be \"passed on\" to the kids.\n \n You can't make up this kind of crazy...\n\n \n \n \nHey! Archie's back! That's great, now you can address this.\n\n TQ I'm not even going to address the \"oh, but those other laws don't count\" argument, as it's nonsensical-which has been pointed out to you in the past. Let's look at that article you posted:\n \n \"However, these spirits can be transmitted to children, especially if someone who had this demonic spirit seduced or raped a child--or even if they were close to gay people. These demons can also be imparted to others through unholy sexual acts.\n \n People become homosexuals because they yield to abnormal acts or lust. It is through some source that they have received a demonic spirit that drives them to their lust. Viewing evil videos or pornographic books is a way of opening the door for Satan to give one an evil, perverse spirit.\"\n \n Are you actually going to try and defend this idiocy that you posted in defence of your beliefs from an \"honest and objective\" source?\n [Archangels response:] Yes, I absolutely do defend it. And I will post verses that explain that our battle is a spiritual one rather than physical. And truthfully speaking TQ, any further explanation for you would be a waste of time as you will only mock the concept that demons influence both peoples actions and world events. You are completely blind to the fact that they have control over every unsaved person alive in different degrees. \n Eph 6:12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age,* against spiritual [hosts] of wickedness in the heavenly [places].\n \n Here are 3 more verses that speak to the spiritual battle we are in.\n \n Ephesians 2:2 in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.\n \n Ephesians 3:10 so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places.\n \n Colossians 1:13 For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son, (NASB \u00a91995)\n \n Here are more references to the power and influence of principalities. Rom 8:38,39, Col 2:15, 1Pe 3:22 I post them now, for your convenience.\n \n Romans 8:38-39 (New International Version)\n 38For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,[a] neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n \n Colossians 2:15 (New International Version)\n 15 And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.\n \n 1 Peter 3:21-22 (English Standard Version)\n 21Baptism, which corresponds to this,(A) now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but(B) as an appeal to God for a good conscience,(C) through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 22who has gone into heaven and(D) is at the right hand of God,(E) with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.",

   "Your attempts to change the subject and detract from the issue at hand will not work Jake. Let's stay on track and attempt to stay with what is known about the agenda and history of the homosexual involvement with legalizing sex with boys and destroying age of consent laws.\n NAMBLA And\n Homosexual Activism\n \n \n Pedophiles And Homosexual Activists Push For Total Sexual Liberation\n \n In August, 2003, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against the state of Kansas over the state's criminal sodomy law involving children. The ACLU is defending Matthew Limon, a homosexual who committed sodomy against a 14-year-old boy in 2000. At the time of his crime, Simon was 18 years old. The ACLU is claiming that Limon's conviction is unconstitutionally discriminatory because the penalties for sodomy with a minor are different than for heterosexual sex with a minor.\n\n \n So the issue was discrimination. Since heterosexuals can have sex at that age, in the state, why can't homosexuals?\n \n \nThe effort to abolish \"age of consent\" laws has been a long-time goal of homosexual activists. The 1972 Gay Rights Platform, for example, called for the abolition of all laws prohibiting sex with children. The platform demands: \"Repeal of all laws governing the age of sexual consent.\"\n\n \n Right, so we have to go back almost 40 years, to the beginning of the gay rights movement. This was when gay people identified as sexual outlaws, and with other goups on the fringes of society. That's not our movement today.\n \n \nIn September, 1995, three homosexual activists published an essay entitled, \"The State Of Gay Liberation\" in Guide, a homosexual publication. The essay was authored by North American Man Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) co-founder David Thorstad, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Professor Richard D. Mohr, and San Francisco journalist Bruce Mirken.\n \n Thorstad, of course, is a life-long pederast and homosexual activist who clearly describes the important linkage between homosexuality and pedophilia. In a speech given before a homosexual group in Mexico in 1998, Thorstad said: \"Pederasty is the main form that male homosexuality has acquired throughout Western civilization-and not only in the West! Pederasty is inseparable from the high points of Western culture-ancient Greece and the Renaissance.\" (David Thorstad, \"Pederasty And Homosexuality,\" NAMBLA web site)\n \n Fellow author Professor Richard Mohr, is a homosexual activist who is an advocate for same-sex marriage and has said he hopes that homosexual marriage will help define \"monogamy\" out of marriage altogether. (Stanley Kurtz, \"Beyond Gay Marriage,\" The Weekly Standard, Aug. 4-11, 2003)\n \n Bruce Mirken is a homosexual and San Francisco journalist who was arrested in 1998 for attempting to have sex with a 13-year-old boy he had contacted through the Internet. When he entered a Sacramento park to sodomize the boy, he was met by police who had been tracking his activities on the Internet. The charges were eventually dropped against him on a technicality.\n \n Sexual Liberation For Children\n \n Thorstad and Professor Mohr want sexual liberation for children and Mirken believes that AIDS activism is what will help perpetuate and strengthen the homosexual movement.\n \n According to David Thorstad, in \"The State Of Gay Liberation,\" homosexuals must get back to a \"radical vision of sexual freedom for all. We need to reaffirm our place in the great variety of same-sex behaviors that exist-have always existed-in human societies. We dare not allow our homosexual gift to be alienated from us by the limited vision, stifling political correctness, and erotophobic provincialism.\" In short, homosexuals should openly support the promotion of adult/child sex!\n \n Professor Mohr argues that the use of \"gay youth\" is a key to gaining political and cultural victories in the U.S. He writes: \"...these brave youth are key to culture's change on gay issues. Thanks to them, increasingly people know someone for whom being gay is an issue. Thanks to them the gay movement is achieving critical mass.\" Bruce Mirken claims that radical AIDS activism is what will save the homosexual movement from decline.\n \n The effort to push adult/child sex isn't limited to these three homosexual activists. It is part of the overall homosexual movement. As author Mary Eberstadt wrote in \"Pedophilia Chic: Reconsidered\" in The Weekly Standard, (Jan. 1, 2001): \"The reason why the public is being urged to reconsider boy pedophilia is that this 'question,' settled though it may be in the opinions and laws of the rest of the country, is demonstrably not yet settled within certain parts of the gay rights movement.\" Eberstadt notes that as the homosexual movement becomes more mainstream, this \"question\" about adult/child sex will become more prominent. Homosexuals who desire sex with children will do exactly what the ACLU is doing in Kansas: Destroy all laws banning sex between adults and children.Exposed: Homosexual Urban Legend: NAMBLA And Homosexual Activism\n \n These are historically documented facts which can be independently verified. This isn't me attacking anyone but merely exposing the hidden agenda of the homosexual community which denies support for NAMBLA publicly, but supports them and their agenda in any way they can. The whole piece is very damming but feel free to prove any of it wrong on a point by point basis.\n\n \n What you are talking about is opinions of a few individuals, and one specific article. When an article is debating an issue, they present two sides of an opinion. It doesn't mean the publication or the community it serves supports all opinions presented. Some of what you posted are mere editorial opinions by individuals. \n \n Many publications discuss the issue. Some author and publish books on it---\n \n Harmful to Minors: The Perils of Protecting Children From Sex, published by University of Minnesota Press.\n \n These people have nothing to do with NAMBLA, and these publications also have no connection to the gay rights movement. The authors are not homosexual. I suppose the fact that people published articles on Judith Levine's opinions represented in her book are an indictment of entire communities in which these are published? Like my local newspaper?\n \n By the way, pederastry was practiced at a time when different sex couples were being married at 12 years old or younger. This is not accepted in our culture today, whether it is a same sex or different sex relationship. \n \n \nSure it does. hetero child molesters are an aberration of heterosexuality just as homosexual child molesters are an aberration of homosexuality. What I am maintaining though is that it is homosexuals which are attracted to boys while heterosexual deviants are attracted to girls. That is the crux of the point I'm defending which you refuse to admit to.\n\n \n The evidence doesn't support your claim. Common sense doesn't either. What attracts men to men and men to women are not the same things that attracted pedophiles to children. The children are not physically developed. The girls do not have breasts, the boys do not have fully functioning, developed genitalia.\n \n \nMan are you ultra sensitive Jake. Show where I said you were defending pedophelia? I said you are defending against it being a very real practice and preference within the gay community. That isn't a personal indictment of your acceptance of it as right or good at all.\n\n \n You said I was defending that \"aspect of human nature\". I defend against your argument, which is not supported by facts. Are there some homosexuals who molest children? Yes. Does it represent homosexuality in any way? No. \n \n \nOn this point I will agree. But just as the aberration exists within the hetero community with an attraction to young girls, so does it exist within the homosexual community with an attraction for young boys. That's my point and my only issue here which you seem anathema to accept. \n\n \n It's neither homosexuality nor heterosexuality. It's child abuse. It's a harmful, anti-social behaviour. Some people who engage in it are pedophiles. Pedophilia is separate from homosexuality and heterosexuality.\n \n \nAs I said Jake, and again you seem unwilling or unable to grasp it. I wasn't a believer in Christ when this occurred. So my current spiritual convictions had no bearing on that night or that experience in any way. I was just a horny kid who had one goal on his mind that night, and that was to get laid. The moral of that story was my ability to refrain from acting on those powerful hormonal impulses with a girl who seemed mature enough on every level of my immature considerations that night to have sex with, and who wanted to have sex. Sexual perverts and Narcissists have no such proclivity or ability to refrain from doing that which they know is illegal and morally wrong.\n\n \n In discussing narcissists, this has no bearing on one's heterosexuality or homosexuality. It's something separate, like child molestation and pedophilia are separate.",

Your source has an obvious political agenda. I showed how these same tactics can easily be used against heterosexuals:\n \n http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/Articles/000,015.pdf\n \n It's patently obvious to everyone of any sophistication, that an article which simply discusses an issue or quotes merely one particular perspective on an issue, is not necessarily an indictment on an entire publication, nor an entire group of people who may read the publication. How else could we have debate? In the letters to the editor section of your local paper, for example, you will find a wide range of views.\n \n I asked you, sine the Associated Press and my local newspaper had articles which included the views of Judith Levine on her book, does that idict everyone associated, including the \n readers, in having an agenda in support of child molestation?

HERE IT IS AGAIN, TRY READING WHAT YOUR COHORTS SAID FOR COMPREHENSION.\n NAMBLA And\n Homosexual Activism\n \n \n Pedophiles And Homosexual Activists Push For Total Sexual Liberation\n \n In August, 2003, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against the state of Kansas over the state's criminal sodomy law involving children. The ACLU is defending Matthew Limon, a homosexual who committed sodomy against a 14-year-old boy in 2000. At the time of his crime, Simon was 18 years old. The ACLU is claiming that Limon's conviction is unconstitutionally discriminatory because the penalties for sodomy with a minor are different than for heterosexual sex with a minor.\n \n Kansas Attorney General Phill KIine says the fairness of Limon's sentence should be a state legislative issue, not a constitutional one. According to Kline, \"If the ACLU wins in the thrust of their arguments, it means the state has no right to say that it is illegal for an adult to have sex with a 13-year-old child.\" Kline also fears that an ACLU victory will make it difficult for the state to enforce laws against polygamy, incest, bestiality, and other sexual perversions.\n \n The effort to abolish \"age of consent\" laws has been a long-time goal of homosexual activists. The 1972 Gay Rights Platform, for example, called for the abolition of all laws prohibiting sex with children. The platform demands: \"Repeal of all laws governing the age of sexual consent.\"\n \n In September, 1995, three homosexual activists published an essay entitled, \"The State Of Gay Liberation\" in Guide, a homosexual publication. The essay was authored by North American Man Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) co-founder David Thorstad, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Professor Richard D. Mohr, and San Francisco journalist Bruce Mirken.\n \n Thorstad, of course, is a life-long pederast and homosexual activist who clearly describes the important linkage between homosexuality and pedophilia. In a speech given before a homosexual group in Mexico in 1998, Thorstad said: \"Pederasty is the main form that male homosexuality has acquired throughout Western civilization-and not only in the West! Pederasty is inseparable from the high points of Western culture-ancient Greece and the Renaissance.\" (David Thorstad, \"Pederasty And Homosexuality,\" NAMBLA web site)\n \n Fellow author Professor Richard Mohr, is a homosexual activist who is an advocate for same-sex marriage and has said he hopes that homosexual marriage will help define \"monogamy\" out of marriage altogether. (Stanley Kurtz, \"Beyond Gay Marriage,\" The Weekly Standard, Aug. 4-11, 2003)\n \n Bruce Mirken is a homosexual and San Francisco journalist who was arrested in 1998 for attempting to have sex with a 13-year-old boy he had contacted through the Internet. When he entered a Sacramento park to sodomize the boy, he was met by police who had been tracking his activities on the Internet. The charges were eventually dropped against him on a technicality.\n \n Sexual Liberation For Children\n \n Thorstad and Professor Mohr want sexual liberation for children and Mirken believes that AIDS activism is what will help perpetuate and strengthen the homosexual movement.\n \n According to David Thorstad, in \"The State Of Gay Liberation,\" homosexuals must get back to a \"radical vision of sexual freedom for all. We need to reaffirm our place in the great variety of same-sex behaviors that exist-have always existed-in human societies. We dare not allow our homosexual gift to be alienated from us by the limited vision, stifling political correctness, and erotophobic provincialism.\" In short, homosexuals should openly support the promotion of adult/child sex!\n \n Professor Mohr argues that the use of \"gay youth\" is a key to gaining political and cultural victories in the U.S. He writes: \"...these brave youth are key to culture's change on gay issues. Thanks to them, increasingly people know someone for whom being gay is an issue. Thanks to them the gay movement is achieving critical mass.\" Bruce Mirken claims that radical AIDS activism is what will save the homosexual movement from decline.\n \n The effort to push adult/child sex isn't limited to these three homosexual activists. It is part of the overall homosexual movement. As author Mary Eberstadt wrote in \"Pedophilia Chic: Reconsidered\" in The Weekly Standard, (Jan. 1, 2001): \"The reason why the public is being urged to reconsider boy pedophilia is that this 'question,' settled though it may be in the opinions and laws of the rest of the country, is demonstrably not yet settled within certain parts of the gay rights movement.\" Eberstadt notes that as the homosexual movement becomes more mainstream, this \"question\" about adult/child sex will become more prominent. Homosexuals who desire sex with children will do exactly what the ACLU is doing in Kansas: Destroy all laws banning sex between adults and children.Exposed: Homosexual Urban Legend: NAMBLA And Homosexual Activism",

Let's look at that article you posted:\n \n \"However, these spirits can be transmitted to children, especially if someone who had this demonic spirit seduced or raped a child--or even if they were close to gay people. These demons can also be imparted to others through unholy sexual acts.\n \n People become homosexuals because they yield to abnormal acts or lust. It is through some source that they have received a demonic spirit that drives them to their lust. Viewing evil videos or pornographic books is a way of opening the door for Satan to give one an evil, perverse spirit.\"\n \n Are you actually going to try and defend this idiocy that you posted in defence of your beliefs from an \"honest and objective\" source?\n Yes, I absolutely do defend it. And I will post verses that explain that our battle is a spiritual one rather than physical. And truthfully speaking TQ, any further explanation for you would be a waste of time as you will only mock the concept that demons influence both peoples actions and world events. You are completely blind to the fact that they have control over every unsaved person alive in different degrees. \n Eph 6:12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age,* against spiritual [hosts] of wickedness in the heavenly [places].\n \n Here are 3 more verses that speak to the spiritual battle we are in.\n \n Ephesians 2:2 in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.\n \n Ephesians 3:10 so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places.\n \n Colossians 1:13 For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son, (NASB \u00a91995)\n \n Here are more references to the power and influence of principalities.

Let's see your evidence. And while you're at it, prove that all of this other information is either inaccurate or biased in its conclusions. \n \n Only in the warped rationalizations of defensive homosexuals could they insist that it's straight men who seek to molest boys when it's homosexuals who are attracted to their own gender and when the culture of youth is rampant in the homosexual community. \n On Homosexuals in the Catholic Priesthood\n Pedophile Protection Observations \n \n \n In a conversation with a well qualified school teacher who is a convert to Catholicism, she stated that she believes that as many as 75% of priests may be homosexual. Later, in consideration of what she had said, I reflected upon a number of priests in the archdiocese and had to admit the possibility that a high percentage of them might at least be homosexually oriented. I told her that I had considered the possibility that 40% of priests might be homosexual but found it hard to believe that the numbers she suggested could be correct. In using the term homosexual I am not distinguishing between those who are chaste and those who are active / practicing homosexuals.\n \n Shortly after ordination I had reflected that it would be terrible that if as many as 2% of priests were homosexual. Perhaps a year later in a conversation with a highly placed priest of the archdiocese he stated that approximately 35% of priests were homosexuals. It was most disconcerting to read the following article in which Fr. Cozzens, the head of a Catholic seminary, says that estimates range as high as 60% of American priests are homosexual.\n \n Unfortunately the article states that, \"Cozzens is not against ordaining gay men, and concedes some effective bishops and even some popes may have been gay.\"\n \n I totally disagree with his position of not being against ordaining gay men. I personally believe that it should be incorporated into the Code of Canon Law that homosexual orientation invalidates ordination, that is, makes homosexual orientation a diriment impediment to ordination. I further believe that an active homosexual cleric or religious (including pedophiles) should incur a totally reserved automatic excommunication that remains unforgivable while remaining in such position. Such sin would be a permanent impediment in regard to returning to religious life.\n \n While the expulsion of active homosexuals would possibly, even probably, cause a significant temporary decline in the number of available priests, I believe that in the long run the Church would have a great increase in vocations with a correspondingly healthier priesthood and consequently a morally healthier Church and world.\n \n Father David C.

The applicable section is in chapter 4.\n \n THE HOMOSEXUAL ISSUES INVOLVING CHILDREN IN CANADA\n Q6 Are homosexual men more inclined to child molestation than heterosexual men?\n In gross numbers, no. Proportionally, yes, much more.\n According to American studies, the evidence indicates that homosexual men molest boys and teenagers at rates completely disproportionate to the rates at which heterosexual men molest girls. A study shows that the homosexual child molester accounts for approximately 7 times more victims than the heterosexual molester. When it comes to child sex abuse, men are almost always the perpetrator. Up to one-third or more of child sex abuse cases are committed against boys, but less than 3% of the population is homosexual. Also according to a study published in Adolescence, 29% of the adult children of homosexual parents have been specifically subjected to sexual molestation as a child by a homosexual parent, compared to only 0.6 percent of adult children of heterosexual parents. \n According to the American Journal of Diseases of Children and The Advocate, close to 60% of adolescent AIDS sufferers were infected by adult bisexual and homosexual men. Thousands of these American boys are now dead. The same is probably true for other western countries like Canada, where many young runaway boys end up prostituting themselves for men.\n Although pedophilia is condemned by most homosexuals, it remains condoned by many gay and lesbian leading North American activists who lobby for the lowering of the age of consent for sex. It is said to be healthy for the boys involved by the self-proclaimed homosexual association NAMBLA (North American Man Boy Love Association). Intergenerational sex (often used euphemism for pederasty) is an undeniable fixture of gay literature, gay films, gay travel and gay prostitution. In the 70's, The Advocate repeatedly ran full page adds for a \"Penetrable boy doll\" and in the 90's, 21% of it's readers admitted having been molested before the age of 15. \n \n Other questions and answers\n Many more studies can be found on the above matters and related ones. Although they are seldom heard in the mainstream Western media, several experts can explain the reality of the homosexual life style, and the consequences to the health of the sexual minority and the self proclaimed real objectives of the homosexual lobby. \n http://www.crin.org/docs/resources/treaties/crc.34/Canada_RW_Update.doc\n \n [QUOTE=Archangel;350900]This is taken from another debate on another thread, Galileo posted this article as an example of how slanted and biased World Net Daily is, but I want to discuss the content of this article and the arguments if offers regarding the issue of who it is that molests little boys and why the homosexual community gets a pass on this crime as a social issue within it given the evidence this article clarifies?\n \n I think it's important to make this debate about supportable facts and social observations and not about attacking the sources used to make points on either side of the issue.\n \n \n \n Show me what isn't totally objective about this article Galileo!!! It quotes a rebuttal from gay sources which attempt to refute its conclusions and definitely gives both sides of the story a hearing while defending its perspective.

Here's the article:\n Report: Pedophilia more common among 'gays'\n Research purports to reveal 'dark side' of homosexual culture\n Posted: April 29, 2002\n 1:00 am Eastern\n \n By Jon Dougherty\n \u00a9 2009 WorldNetDaily.com\n \n Child molestation and pedophilia occur far more commonly among homosexuals than among heterosexuals on a per capita basis, according to a new study.\n \n \"Overwhelming evidence supports the belief that homosexuality is a sexual deviancy often accompanied by disorders that have dire consequences for our culture,\" wrote Steve Baldwin in, \"Child Molestation and the Homosexual Movement,\" soon to be published by the Regent University Law Review.\n \n Baldwin is the executive director of the Council for National Policy in Washington, D.C.\n \n \"It is difficult to convey the dark side of the homosexual culture without appearing harsh,\" wrote Baldwin. \"However, it is time to acknowledge that homosexual behavior threatens the foundation of Western civilization - the nuclear family.\"\n \n Though the homosexual community and much of the media scoff at such accusations, Baldwin - who chaired the California Assembly's Education committee, where he fought against support for the homosexual agenda in the state's public schools - says in his report that homosexual activists' \"efforts to target children both for their own sexual pleasure and to enlarge the homosexual movement\" constitute an \"unmistakable\" attack on \"the family unit.\"\n \n Baldwin's research is substantiated in a recently completed body of work written by Dr. Judith Reisman, president of the Institute for Media Education and author of numerous authoritative books debunking sexual myths, including \"Kinsey, Crimes & Consequences.\"\n \n In her thesis - also written for the Regent University Law Review - Reisman cited psychologist Eugene Abel, whose research found that homosexuals \"sexually molest young boys with an incidence that is occurring from five times greater than the molestation of girls. ...\"\n \n Abel also found that non-incarcerated \"child molesters admitted from 23.4 to 281.7 acts per offender ... whose targets were males.\"\n \n \"The rate of homosexual versus heterosexual child sexual abuse is staggering,\" said Reisman, who was the principal investigator for an $800,000 Justice Department grant studying child pornography and violence. \"Abel's data of 150.2 boys abused per male homosexual offender finds no equal (yet) in heterosexual violations of 19.8 girls.\"\n \n Jay Heavener, spokesman for PFLAG - Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, counters that federal crime data refute claims that homosexuals molest children at higher rates than heterosexuals.\n \n \"According to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), this claim is false,\" he told WND by e-mail. \"The gay and lesbian community calls into question any dubious research which flies in the face of our own experience.\"\n \n And Gary Schoener, a clinical psychologist who has been diagnosing and treating clergy abuse for 28 years, told Salon.com, \"There are far more heterosexual cases than homosexual.\"\n \n In terms of sheer numbers, that may be true. But in terms of numbers of children abused per offender, homosexuals abuse with far greater frequency; and boys, research shows, are the much-preferred target.\n \n Baldwin says evidence he examined disproves the assertion that child molestation is more prevalent among heterosexuals. Both he and Reisman found that media coverage of adult homosexual abuse of minors is also slanted.\n \n \"The National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association (NLGJA) recently boasted that although homosexuals are less than two percent of the population, three-fourths of the people who decide the content of the front page of the New York Times are homosexual,\" Reisman wrote.\n \n That one fact is especially noteworthy, experts point out, given the recent child sex scandals taking place within the American Catholic church.\n \n A survey by WorldNetDaily of recent news reports found that rarely did the media describe priestly sexual abuse as \"homosexual\" or \"gay\" activity - even though the worst incidents involved male-to-male contact, and a spate of investigative reports has revealed that the Vatican is concerned about an upsurge of homosexuals in seminary schools throughout the world.\n \n Gay press promotes sex with children\n \n Baldwin says his research not only \"confirms that homosexuals molest children at a rate vastly higher than heterosexuals,\" but it found that \"the mainstream homosexual culture\" even \"commonly promotes sex with children.\"\n \n \"The editorial board of the leading pedophile academic journal, Paidika, is dominated by prominent homosexual scholars such as San Francisco State University professor John DeCecco, who happens to edit the Journal of Homosexuality,\" Baldwin wrote.\n \n During his research, he also found:\n \n The Journal of Homosexuality recently published a special double-issue entitled, \"Male Intergenerational Intimacy,\" containing many articles portraying sex between men and minor boys as loving relationships. One article said parents should look upon the pedophile who loves their son \"not as a rival or competitor, not as a theft of their property, but as a partner in the boy's upbringing, someone to be welcomed into their home.\"\n In 1995 the homosexual magazine \"Guide\" said, \"We can be proud that the gay movement has been home to the few voices who have had the courage to say out loud that children are naturally sexual\" and \"deserve the right to sexual expression with whoever they choose. ...\" The article went on to say: \"Instead of fearing being labeled pedophiles, we must proudly proclaim that sex is good, including children's sexuality ... we must do it for the children's sake.\"\n Larry Kramer, the founder of ACT-UP, a noted homosexual activist group, wrote in his book, \"Report from the Holocaust: The Making of an AIDS Activist\": \"In those instances where children do have sex with their homosexual elders, be they teachers or anyone else, I submit that often, very often, the child desires the activity, and perhaps even solicits it.\"\n In a study of advertisements in the influential homosexual newspaper, The Advocate, Reisman found ads for a \"Penetrable Boy Doll ... available in three provocative positions. She also found that the number of erotic boy images in each issue of The Advocate averaged 14.\n Homosexual newspapers and travel publications advertise prominently for countries where boy prostitution is heavy, such as Burma, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand.\n Homosexuality 'youth-oriented'?\n \n \"Research on the homosexual lifestyle confirms it is almost exclusively a youth-oriented culture,\" Baldwin wrote. \"Very few gays exhibit preference for older men.\"\n \n \"Some admit to focus on teenage boys,\" he said, \"some on prepubescent boys, and many cross over between categories.\"\n \n A 1988 study detailed in Baldwin's report found that most pedophiles even consider themselves to be \"gay.\" According to the study, \"Archives of Sexual Behavior,\" some 86 percent of pedophiles described themselves as homosexual or bisexual. Also, the study found, the number of teenage male prostitutes who identify as homosexuals has risen from 10 percent to 60 percent in the past 15 years.\n \n When asked what he thought about critics who attempt to debunk his research, Baldwin said the results speak for themselves.\n \n \"For them to say this theory is false is to call many of the homosexual movement's leaders liars,\" he said. \"Most of my evidence comes right from the gay community.\"\n \n \"I managed to find enough evidence that my thesis - child molestation is an integral part of the homosexual movement - is a valid thesis,\" Baldwin told WorldNetDaily.\n \n Other experts have also found a distinct pattern between child sex abusers and the incidence of homosexuality.\n \n \"How long can psychologists be in denial about the significance of the dark side, and ignore what it implies about the homosexual condition? And there's a matter of even greater concern. How long will psychologists eagerly throw open the door to gay life for every sexually confused teenager?\" writes Joseph Nicolosi, Ph.D, on behalf of NARTH - the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality - a group that says it exists to \"provide psychological understanding of the cause, treatment and behavior patterns associated with homosexuality, within the boundaries of a civil public dialogue.\"\n \n The North American Man-Boy Love Association, or NAMBLA, is \"a group that openly promotes sex with minor boys and claims that boy-lovers respond to the needs of the boys they love,\" Baldwin said in his report.\n \n The group is often endorsed by \"many of the homosexual movement's most prominent leaders,\" he said.\n \n Advocacy moving to schools\n \n Promotion of the \"gay and lesbian lifestyle\" is increasing in the nation's public schools.\n \n A WND survey of homosexual-oriented websites found that almost every group has some sort of program to \"educate\" teachers, school administrators and other school employees about the homosexual lifestyle:\n \n GLSEN - the Gay Lesbian and Straight Education Network - bills itself as \"the largest national network of parents, students, educators and others\" specifically formed to end \"discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression in K-12 schools. Two recent press released boasted of the Broward County (Fla.) school board approving GLSEN-sponsored \"training for teachers.\"\n A student activist working with GLSEN officials has managed to \"give voice\" recently to \"gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered students\" at California schools;\n PFLAG has created a national campaign called, \"From Our House to the Schoolhouse,\" distributing to school officials - among other materials - a booklet entitled, \"Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation and Youth: A Primer For Principals, Educators, & School Personnel. [Editor's note: Readers need the Adobe PDF reader to open and read this file.]\n Though most school-related programs are sold to administrators and parents as programs designed simply to end persecution of homosexuals and lesbians, none disclose what Baldwin says is compelling evidence that homosexuality is harmful to children.\n \n \"What ... does the academic literature say about the relationship between homosexuality and child molestation? Quite a bit, actually,\" he wrote, quoting data compiled by the Family Research Institute: \"Scientific studies confirm a strong pedophilic predisposition among homosexuals.\"\n \n The institute, after reviewing more than 19 studies and peer-reviewed reports in a 1985 \"Psychological Reports\" article, found that homosexuals account for between 25 and 40 percent of all child molestation.\n \n \"But this number is low,\" Baldwin says, \"due to the fact that many reporters will not report if a child molester is a homosexual, even if he knows that to be the case.\"\n Now, consider that the vast majority of child molestation cases are against boys not girls and add to that the number of straight males to homosexual males which puts homosexuals at only 2% of the population in this article, (I thought it was more like 4%) and you have an extreme per capita imbalance in favor of homosexual molestation over heterosexuals. And I think this article proves that very effectively while giving the opposition side a hearing in explaining their side as reflected in the bolded.\n \n [QUOTE=Archangel;351293]To summarize this opinion, foundit realizes he can't refute my evidence above as it is absolutely rational and reasonable based on the truth of my arguments and the reality of the situation. So he will attempt to discredit me without even attempting to refute the evidence. So since you can't refute these facts: http://www.traditionalvalues.org/urban/nine.phphow about these made by Father David Trosch about homosexual priests and the abuse scandal which has plagued the American Catholic Church?",

   "To summarize this opinion, foundit realizes he can't refute my evidence above as it is absolutely rational and reasonable based on the truth of my arguments.\n\n Archie, your claim is either a bald-faced lie, or willful ignorance on your part.\n I have posted SEVERAL posts you have COMPLETELY failed to respond to or address.\n \n And somehow I just knew that as I posted that one comment to Chester, you would pick at it and try to make it into something it wasn't. It's part of your modus operandi.\n \n \n \nSo he will attempt to discredit me without even attempting to refute the evidence. So since you can't refute these facts: \n\n Archie, I have REPEATEDLY replied to the junk you threw out there.\n YOU are the one who haven't responded to MY posts on this issue.\n http://www.4forums.com/political/gay-rights-debates/12605-debate-about-homosexualitys-link-child-molestation-3.html#post351204\n http://www.4forums.com/political/gay-rights-debates/12605-debate-about-homosexualitys-link-child-molestation-2.html#post351102\n \n And then there is this post chock full of research articles proving my point, to which you just whine (FALSELY) about them being \"homosexual apologists\" and claim that everybody is lying.\n http://www.4forums.com/political/gay-rights-debates/12605-debate-about-homosexualitys-link-child-molestation-2.html#post351055\n \n \n \nhttp://www.traditionalvalues.org/urban/nine.phphow about these made by Father David Trosch about homosexual priests and the abuse scandal which has plagued the American church?\n\n Archie, WHAT FACTS????\n Can't you recognize the language in your own article???\n Let me highlight it for you...\n In a conversation with a well qualified school teacher who is a convert to Catholicism, she stated that she believes that as many as 75% of priests may be homosexual. Later, in consideration of what she had said, I reflected upon a number of priests in the archdiocese and had to admit the possibility that a high percentage of them might at least be homosexually oriented. I told her that I had considered the possibility that 40% of priests might be homosexual but found it hard to believe that the numbers she suggested could be correct. In using the term homosexual I am not distinguishing between those who are chaste and those who are active / practicing homosexuals.These are people GUESSING about how many people they THINK MIGHT be gay in Catholicism...\n NOT research.\n \n This isn't \"proof\" of anything, especially considering their estimates are ALL OVER THE PLACE.\n First it's 75%.\n Then they want to guess 40%.\n Then maybe 35%????\n \n These guys DO NOT KNOW AND THEY ARE GUESSING, and you toss that out there like it's \"proof\" I can't repudiate???\n :xbanghead\n :xbanghead\n :xbanghead\n \n \n \nI further believe that an active homosexual cleric or religious (including pedophiles) should incur a totally reserved automatic excommunication that remains unforgivable while remaining in such position. Such sin would be a permanent impediment in regard to returning to religious life.\n\n This part of the article was kind of funny.\n If you watched the Catholic church's response to the questions of \"child molestors\" in our ranks, vs \"gays\" in our ranks, their responses were incredibly different.\n For gays in their ranks, they quickly came out with a standard of practice to kick them out.\n For pedophiles in their ranks, they actually stalled on the issue. When THEIR OWN CLERGY pressed the issue, they tried to refuse to do the obvious and intelligent response.\n That says something...\n \n \n Archie, on another level I once thought about how vile you can be regarding slurring homosexuals, but was amused that you hadn't hit this \"topic\" which is a favorite of some others out on the internet.\n It's a topic which is thoroughly refuted BY THE EXPERTS, and people like you have to run to the ANTI-GAY resources in order to find your fodder, but that has never stopped you before. (And what's really funny about that is you will throw out allegations of \"homosexual apologists\" as you dwell in posting quotes SOLELY FROM ANTI-GAY resources... emoticon_rolleyes )\n \n I guess you finally hit the bottom of the barrel...",

If the catholic church actually believed that the child molesters who abused boys for decades weren't homosexual priests, then why did they respond to that crisis by adopting the policy to not allow homosexuals to become priests?\n\n Sigh!\n \n THIS is where Archie continues his repugnant tirade, ignoring facts.\n A variety of organizations have excluded gays from their ranks, ADMITTING that it had nothing to do with \"child molestation\". The Boy Scouts come to mind.\n \n The funny thing here is that Archie is trying to REVERSE the burden of proof, and in a most absurd and idiotic manner.\n He is trying to pretend that the REASON for Catholics excluding gays is somehow related to \"child molestation\", yet he provides NO PROOF of his claim, while at the same time demanding others provide a response.\n \n The \"gay\" statement was coincidental. The Catholic church has LONG HAD A COMPLAINT regarding gays in the clergy. Long before molestation scandals broke...\n \n The REAL question that disproves Archie's innuendo is why they easily came out with an anti-gay announcement, but STALLED on the child molestation announcement. It would seem logical that if the two were in any way linked, they would simply have THE SAME POLICY.\n And these policies would be released at the same time.\n \n But of course, Archie is grotesquely wrong in his insinuation. \n \n \n \nAfter all, they had decades of data to go by before finally deciding to do the spiritual and scriptural thing and separate these people from their church members children. \n\n \"Decades of data\"?\n They have NO DATA.\n \n You presented people GUESSING as to how many gays in the clergy, and it ranged from 75% to 35%. That type of range alone should show that they are WILDLY GUESSING about their claim.\n \n And furthermore, there is NO DATA here.\n All you have is male victims, and then you INSIST that they must be gay cause a man molested a little boy... :xbanghead\n \n \n The funny thing about all this is that if ARchie's position was real, it could TRY to DIRECTLY REFUTE what I am talking about.\n The anti-gay resources Archie clings to could TRY to examine the sexual orientation of the people who molest boys, and SHOW that they were \"gay\" without the child molestation victim.\n BUT THEY CANNOT for two reasons.\n 1) These guys don't even do their own research. Archie keeps quoting \"Reisman\" who talks about \"Eugene Abel's\" research, but if you LOOK AT Dr. Abel's research, it DISTINCTIVELY says that MOST people who molest boys are STRAIGHT in their adult relationships.\n Archie CONTINUES to quote the Reisman liar even AFTER that lie is pointed out.\n \n 2) If they were to do so, it would prove their case wrong, so they ignore the issue. Archie's SOLE response on this issue has been one of DENIAL.\n Over and OVER and OVER again, he just keeps insisting that it cannot be true that a heterosexual man would molest a boy. Cause he can't fathom it...\n \n Quite frankly, his approach is like insisting that a schizophrenic man who hears voices must have better hearing. He tries to give a SANE association for a problem that is INSANE at its roots.\n Pedophiles are SICK people. Their desires to molest children are born out of SICK portions of their mind.\n Not the healthy portions which lead people to seek relationships and sexual relationships with adults. :xbanghead",

   "[B]Go ahead and show that evidence that ANY priests who abused young boys were straight jason. Let's see your evidence. And while you're at it, prove that all of this other information is either inaccurate or biased in its conclusions. \n \n Only in the warped rationalizations of defensive homosexuals could they insist that it's straight men who seek to molest boys when it's homosexuals who are attracted to their own gender and when the culture of youth is rampant in the homosexual community. \n\n \n \n Facts About Homosexuality and Child Molestation\n \n Facts About Homosexuality and Child Molestation\n \n Members of disliked minority groups are often stereotyped as representing a danger to the majority's most vulnerable members. For example, Jews in the Middle Ages were accused of murdering Christian babies in ritual sacrifices. Black men in the United States were often lynched after being falsely accused of raping White women.\n \n In a similar fashion, gay people have often been portrayed as a threat to children. Back in 1977, when Anita Bryant campaigned successfully to repeal a Dade County (FL) ordinance prohibiting anti-gay discrimination, she named her organization \"Save Our Children,\" and warned that \"a particularly deviant-minded [gay] teacher could sexually molest children\" (Bryant, 1977, p. 114). [Bibliographic references are on a different web page]\n \n In recent years, antigay activists have routinely asserted that gay people are child molesters. This argument was often made in debates about the Boy Scouts of America's policy to exclude gay scouts and scoutmasters. More recently, in the wake of Rep. Mark Foley's resignation from the US House of Representatives in 2006, antigay activists and their supporters seized on the scandal to revive this canard.\n \n It has also been raised in connection with scandals about the Catholic church's attempts to cover up the abuse of young males by priests. Indeed, the Vatican's early response to the 2002 revelations of widespread Church cover-ups of sexual abuse by priests was to declare that gay men should not be ordained.\n \n \n Public belief in\n the stereotype The number of Americans who believe the myth that gay people are child molesters has declined substantially. In a 1970 national survey, more than 70% of respondents agreed with the assertions that \"Homosexuals are dangerous as teachers or youth leaders because they try to get sexually involved with children\" or that \"Homosexuals try to play sexually with children if they cannot get an adult partner.\"1\n \n By contrast, in a 1999 national poll, the belief that most gay men are likely to molest or abuse children was endorsed by only 19% of heterosexual men and 10% of heterosexual women. Even fewer - 9% of men and 6% of women - regarded most lesbians as child molesters.\n \n Consistent with these findings, Gallup polls have found that an increasing number of Americans would allow gay people to be elementary school teachers. For example, the proportion was 54% in 2005, compared to 27% in 1977.\n \n Examining the\n Research Even though most Americans don't regard gay people as child molesters, confusion remains widespread in this area. To understand the facts, it is important to examine the results of scientific research. However, when we evaluate research on child molestation, our task is complicated by several problems.\n \n One problem is that none of the studies in this area have obtained data from a probability sample, that is, a sample that can be assumed to be representative of the population of all child molesters. Rather, most research has been conducted only with convicted perpetrators or with pedophiles who sought professional help. Consequently, they may not accurately describe child molesters who have never been caught or have not sought treatment.\n \n Terminology A second problem is that the terminology used in this area is often confusing and can even be misleading. We can begin to address that problem by defining some basic terms.\n \n Pedophilia and child molestation are used in different ways, even by professionals. Pedophilia usually refers to an adult psychological disorder characterized by a preference for prepubescent children as sexual partners; this preference may or may not be acted upon. The term hebephilia is sometimes used to describe adult sexual attractions to adolescents or children who have reached puberty.\n \n Whereas pedophilia and hebephilia refer to psychological propensities, child molestation and child sexual abuse are used to describe actual sexual contact between an adult and someone who has not reached the legal age of consent. In this context, the latter individual is referred to as a child, even though he or she may be a teenager.\n \n Although the terms are not always applied consistently, it is useful to distinguish between pedophiles/hebephiles and child molesters/abusers. Pedophilia and hebephilia are diagnostic labels that refer to psychological attractions. Not all pedophiles and hebephiles actually molest children; an adult can be attracted to children or adolescents without ever actually engaging in sexual contact with them.\n \n Child molestation and child sexual abuse refer to actions, and don't imply a particular psychological makeup or motive on the part of the perpetrator. Not all incidents of child sexual abuse are perpetrated by pedophiles or hebephiles; in some cases, the perpetrator has other motives for his or her actions and does not manifest an ongoing pattern of sexual attraction to children.\n \n Thus, not all child sexual abuse is perpetrated by pedophiles (or hebephiles) and not all pedophiles and hebephiles actually commit abuse. Consequently, it is important to use terminology carefully.\n \n Another problem related to terminology arises because sexual abuse of male children by adult men2 is often referred to as \"homosexual molestation.\" The adjective \"homosexual\" (or \"heterosexual\" when a man abuses a female child) refers to the victim's gender in relation to that of the perpetrator. Unfortunately, people sometimes mistakenly interpret it as referring to the perpetrator's sexual orientation.\n \n To avoid this confusion, it is preferable to refer to men's sexual abuse of boys with the more accurate label of male-male molestation. Similarly, it is preferable to refer to men's abuse of girls as male-female molestation. These labels are more accurate because they describe the sex of the individuals involved but don't implicitly convey unwarranted assumptions about the perpetrator's sexual orientation.\n \n Typologies of\n Offenders The distinction between a victim's gender and a perpetrator's sexual orientation is important because many child molesters don't really have an adult sexual orientation. They have never developed the capacity for mature sexual relationships with other adults, either men or women. Instead, their sexual attractions focus on children - boys, girls, or children of both sexes.\n \n Over the years, this fact has been incorporated into various systems for categorizing child molesters. For example, Finkelhor and Araji (1986) proposed that perpetrators' sexual attractions should be conceptualized as ranging along a continuum - from exclusive interest in children at one extreme, to exclusive interest in adult partners at the other end.\n \n Typologies of offenders have often included a distinction between those with an enduring primary preference for children as sexual partners and those who have established age-appropriate relationships but become sexually involved with children under unusual circumstances of extreme stress. Perpetrators in the first category - those with a more or less exclusive interest in children - have been labeled fixated. Fixation means \"a temporary or permanent arrestment of psychological maturation resulting from unresolved formative issues which persist and underlie the organization of subsequent phases of development\" (Groth & Birnbaum, 1978, p. 176). Many clinicians view fixated offenders as being \"stuck\" at an early stage of psychological development.\n \n By contrast, other molesters are described as regressed. Regression is \"a temporary or permanent appearance of primitive behavior after more mature forms of expression had been attained, regardless of whether the immature behavior was actually manifested earlier in the individual's development\" (Groth & Birnbaum, 1978, p. 177). Regressed offenders have developed an adult sexual orientation but under certain conditions (such as extreme stress) they return to an earlier, less mature psychological state and engage in sexual contact with children.\n \n Some typologies of child molesters divide the fixation-regression distinction into multiple categories, and some include additional categories as well (e.g., Knight, 1989).\n \n For the present discussion, the important point is that many child molesters cannot be meaningfully described as homosexuals, heterosexuals, or bisexuals (in the usual sense of those terms) because they are not really capable of a relationship with an adult man or woman. Instead of gender, their sexual attractions are based primarily on age. These individuals - who are often characterized as fixated - are attracted to children, not to men or women.\n \n Using the fixated-regressed distinction, Groth and Birnbaum (1978) studied 175 adult males who were convicted in Massachusetts of sexual assault against a child. None of the men had an exclusively homosexual adult sexual orientation. 83 (47%) were classified as \"fixated;\" 70 others (40%) were classified as regressed adult heterosexuals; the remaining 22 (13%) were classified as regressed adult bisexuals. Of the last group, Groth and Birnbaum observed that \"in their adult relationships they engaged in sex on occasion with men as well as with women. However, in no case did this attraction to men exceed their preference for women....There were no men who were primarily sexually attracted to other adult males...\" (p.180).\n \n Other\n Approaches Other researchers have taken different approaches, but have similarly failed to find a connection between homosexuality and child molestation. Dr. Carole Jenny and her colleagues reviewed 352 medical charts, representing all of the sexually abused children seen in the emergency room or child abuse clinic of a Denver children's hospital during a one-year period (from July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1992). The molester was a gay or lesbian adult in fewer than 1% in which an adult molester could be identified - only 2 of the 269 cases (Jenny et al., 1994).\n \n In yet another approach to studying adult sexual attraction to children, some Canadian researchers observed how homosexual and heterosexual adult men responded to slides of males and females of various ages (child, pubescent, and mature adult). All of the research subjects were first screened to ensure that they preferred physically mature sexual partners. In some of the slides shown to subjects, the model was clothed; in others, he or she was nude. The slides were accompanied by audio recordings. The recordings paired with the nude models described an imaginary sexual interaction between the model and the subject. The recordings paired with the pictures of clothed models described the model engaging in neutral activities (e.g., swimming). To measure sexual arousal, changes in the subjects' penis volume were monitored while they watched the slides and listened to the audiotapes. The researchers found that homosexual males responded no more to male children than heterosexual males responded to female children (Freund et al., 1989).\n \n Science cannot prove a negative. Thus, these studies do not prove that homosexual or bisexual males are no more likely than heterosexual males to molest children. However, each of them failed to prove the alternative hypothesis that homosexual males are more likely than heterosexual men to molest children or to be sexually attracted to children or adolescents.\n \n The Mainstream\n View Reflecting the results of these and other studies, the mainstream view among researchers and professionals who work in the area of child sexual abuse is that homosexual and bisexual men do not pose any special threat to children. For example, in one review of the scientific literature, noted authority Dr. A. Nicholas Groth wrote:\n \n Are homosexual adults in general sexually attracted to children and are preadolescent children at greater risk of molestation from homosexual adults than from heterosexual adults? There is no reason to believe so. The research to date all points to there being no significant relationship between a homosexual lifestyle and child molestation. There appears to be practically no reportage of sexual molestation of girls by lesbian adults, and the adult male who sexually molests young boys is not likely to be homosexual (Groth & Gary, 1982, p. 147). \n \n In a more recent literature review, Dr. Nathaniel McConaghy (1998) similarly cautioned against confusing homosexuality with pedophilia. He noted, \"The man who offends against prepubertal or immediately postpubertal boys is typically not sexually interested in older men or in women\" (p. 259).\n \n This well known lack of a linkage between homosexuality and child molestation accounts for why relatively little research has directly addressed the issue. Proving something we already know simply isn't a priority. Indeed, a commentary that accompanied publication of the 1994 study by Jenny et al. in Pediatrics noted that debates about gay people as molesters \"have little to do with everyday child abuse\" and lamented that they distract lawmakers and the public from dealing with the real problem of children's sexual mistreatment (Krugman, 1994).\n \n Other\n Sexual Abuse In scandals involving the Catholic church, the victims of sexual abuse were often adolescent boys rather than small children. Similarly, the 2006 congressional page scandal involved males who were at least 16 years old.\n \n These are cases in which the term pedophilia - referring as it does to attractions to prepubescent children - can cause confusion. Rather than pedophilia, the accusations stemming from these scandals raised the question of whether gay people shouldn't be trusted in positions of authority where there is any opportunity for sexually harassing or abusing others.\n \n Here again, there is no inherent connection between an adult's sexual orientation and her or his propensity for endangering others. Scientific research provides no evidence that homosexual people are less likely than heterosexuals to exercise good judgment and appropriate discretion in their employment settings. There are no data, for example, showing that gay men and lesbians are more likely than heterosexual men and women to sexually harass their subordinates in the workplace. Data from studies using a variety of psychological measures do not indicate that gay people are more likely than heterosexuals to possess any psychological characteristics that would make them less capable of controlling their sexual urges, refraining from the abuse of power, obeying rules and laws, interacting effectively with others, or exercising good judgment in handling authority. As explained elsewhere on this site, sexual orientation is not a mental illness nor is it inherently associated with impaired psychological functioning.\n \n Gay men and lesbians function effectively in a wide variety of employment settings. The research literature doesn't reveal any differences between heterosexuals, bisexuals, and homosexuals in job performance or ability to properly exercise authority in supervisory roles. As indicated by workplace policies around the United States, a large and growing number of private and public employers do not perceive a problem with hiring gay and bisexual people as employees or managers. Many corporations, educational institutions, and local governments have adopted policies that prohibit discrimination against employees on the basis of sexual orientation. Many of those organizations provide benefits such as health insurance for employees' same-sex partners. Indeed, one widely cited reason for offering such benefits is that they enable a company to remain competitive by attracting high quality employees who happen to be gay, lesbian, or bisexual.\n \n Thus, there is no factual basis for organizations to avoid hiring homosexual or bisexual people, simply on the basis of their sexual orientation, for positions that involve responsibility for or supervision of others, whether children, adolescents, or adults.\n \n What About Claims That Scientific Research Proves Gay Men Are Likely To Molest Children?\n \n Some conservative groups have argued that scientific research strongly supports their claims that homosexuality and pedophilia are linked. The Family Research Council has produced what is perhaps the most extensive attempt to document this claim. It is an article by Timothy J. Dailey titled Homosexuality and Child Abuse.\n \n With 76 footnotes, many of them referring to papers in scientific journals, it appears at first glance to be a thorough and scholarly discussion of the issue. On further examination, however, its central argument - that \"the evidence indicates that homosexual men molest boys at rates grossly disproportionate to the rates at which heterosexual men molest girls\" - doesn't hold up.\n \n In the following section, the main sources cited by Dailey and the FRC to support their claim are reviewed. The papers are listed in the same order in which they are first cited by the FRC article.\n \n 1. Freund et al. (1989). Heterosexuality, homosexuality, and erotic age preference. Journal of Sex Research, 26, 107-117.\n \n This article is discussed above in the \"Other Approaches\" section. As the FRC concedes, it contradicts their argument. The abstract summarizes the authors' conclusion: \"Findings indicate that homosexual males who preferred mature partners responded no more to male children than heterosexual males who preferred mature partners responded to female children.\"\n \n \n 2. Silverthorne & Quinsey. (2000). Sexual partner age preferences of homosexual and heterosexual men and women. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 29, 67-76.\n \n The FRC cites this study to challenge the Freund et al. data (see the previous paper above). However, the methodologies were quite different. Freund and his colleagues used a sample that included sex offenders and they assessed sexual arousal with a physiological measure similar to that described below for the 1988 Marshall et al. study. Silverthorne and Quinsey used a sample of community volunteers who were asked to view pictures of human faces and use a 7-point scale to rate their sexual attractiveness. The apparent ages of the people portrayed in the pictures was originally estimated by Dr. Silverthorne to range from 15 to 50. However, a group of independent raters perceived the male faces to range in age from 18 to 58, and the female faces to range from 19 to 60.\n \n The article doesn't report the data in great detail (e.g., average ratings are depicted only in a graphic; the actual numbers aren't reported) and the authors provide contradictory information about the rating scale (they describe it as a 7-point scale but also say it ranged from 0 to 7, which constitutes an 8-point scale). In either case, it appears that none of the pictures was rated as \"very sexually attractive\" (a rating of 7). Rather, the highest average ratings were approximately 5.\n \n On average, gay men rated the 18-year old male faces the most attractive (average rating = about 5), with attractiveness ratings declining steadily for older faces. They rated the 58-year old male faces 2, on average. By contrast, heterosexual men rated the 25-year old female faces the most attractive (about 5), with the 18- and 28-year old female faces rated lower (between 2 and 3) and the 60-year old female faces rated the least attractive (about 1).\n \n A serious problem with this study is that the researchers didn't control for the possibility that some of the faces pictured in the photos might simply have been more or less physically attractive than the others, independent of their age or gender. The researchers explicitly acknowledged this shortcoming, speculating that the women's faces in the 25-year old group might have been more attractive than women's faces in the other age groups. But they didn't address the possibility that the attractiveness of the male and female faces may not have been comparable.\n \n This issue could have been addressed in various ways. For example, prior to collecting data, the researchers could have started with a large number of photographs and asked a group of independent raters to evaluate the general physical attractiveness of the face in each photo; these ratings could have been used to select photos for the experiment that were equivalent in attractiveness. Getting independent ratings of experimental stimuli in this way is a common procedure in social psychological research.\n \n Thus, even if one accepts the questionable assumption that this study is relevant, it doesn't support the FRC's contention that gay men are more likely than heterosexual men to be child molesters for several reasons:\n * the researchers failed to control for the varying attractiveness of the different photos;\n * all of the faces portrayed in the photos were perceived to be at least 18; and\n * the study merely assessed judgments of sexual attractiveness rather than the research participants' sexual arousal. \n \n \n 3. Blanchard et al. (2000). Fraternal birth order and sexual orientation in pedophiles. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 29, 463-478.\n \n This study categorized convicted sex offenders according to whether they molested or reported sexual attraction to boys only, girls only, or both boys and girls. These groups were labeled, respectively, homosexual pedophiles, heterosexual pedophiles, and bisexual pedophiles. This classification referred to their attractions to children. Adult sexual orientation (or even whether the men had an adult sexual orientation) wasn't assessed.\n \n \n 4. Elliott et al. (1995). Child sexual abuse prevention: What offenders tell us. Child Abuse & Neglect, 19, 579-594.\n \n In this study, child sex offenders were interviewed. Their sexual orientation (gay, heterosexual, bisexual) wasn't assessed. The authors drew from their findings to suggest strategies for how parents and children can prevent sexual victimization. It is noteworthy that none of those strategies involved avoiding gay men.\n \n \n 5. Jenny et al. (1994). Are children at risk for sexual abuse by homosexuals? Pediatrics, 94, 41-44.\n \n This study, described above in the section on \"Other Approaches,\" contradicts the FRC's argument. The FRC faults the study because the researchers didn't directly interview perpetrators but instead relied on the victims' medical charts for information about the offender's sexual orientation. However, other studies cited favorably by the FRC (and summarized in this section) similarly relied on chart data (Erickson et al., 1988) or did not directly assess the sexual orientation of perpetrators (Blanchard et al. 2000; Elliott et al. 1995; Marshall et al., 1988). Thus, the FRC apparently considers this method a weakness only when it leads to results they dislike.\n \n \n 6. Marshall et al. (1988). Sexual offenders against male children: Sexual preference. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 26, 383-391.\n \n In this study, the researchers compared 21 men who had sexually molested a male under 16 years (and at least 5 years younger than themselves) to 18 unemployed men who were not known to have molested a child. Over a series of sessions, each man watched color slides of nude males and females of various ages and listened to audiotaped descriptions of both coercive and consensual sexual interactions between a man and a boy. During the sessions, each man sat in a private booth, where he was instructed to lower his trousers and underwear and attach a rubber tube to his penis. The tube detected any changes in penis circumference, with increases interpreted as indicating sexual arousal.\n \n The FRC cites this study as showing that \"a homosexual and a heterosexual subgroup can be delineated among these offenders.\" This is true but hardly relevant to their claims.\n \n The researchers categorized 7 offenders who were more aroused overall by the male nudes than the female nudes as the homosexual subgroup. They categorized 14 offenders who were more aroused overall by the female nudes as the heterosexual subgroup. The offenders were not asked their sexual orientation (gay, straight, bisexual) and the paper does not report any information about the nature of the offenders' adult sexual relationships, or even if they had any such relationships.\n \n \n 7. Bickley & Beech. (2001). Classifying child abusers: Its relevance to theory and clinical practice. International Journal Of Offender Therapy And Comparative Criminology, 45, 51-69.\n \n This is a literature review and theoretical paper that discusses the strengths and weaknesses of various systems for classifying child molesters. In citing this study, the FRC says it:\n \n refers to homosexual pedophiles as a \"distinct group.\" The victims of homosexual pedophiles \"were more likely to be strangers, that they were more likely to have engaged in paraphiliac behavior separate from that involved in the offence, and that they were more likely to have past convictions for sexual offences.... Other studies [showed a] greater risk of reoffending than those who had offended against girls\" and that the \"recidivism rate for male-victim offenders is approximately twice that for female-victim offenders.\" \n \n In reality, however, the paper was summarizing the findings of other studies, not reporting new data. In the passage excerpted by the FRC, the authors were discussing published papers that used a classification system focusing entirely on the sex of victims (not whether the perpetrator is straight or gay). Here is the complete text (the passages that FRC omitted are highlighted):\n \n \"Grubin and Kennedy (1991) reported that when dividing sex offenders based simply on the sex of their victims, offenders against boys stood out as a distinct group. They noted that their victims were more likely to be strangers, that they were more likely to have engaged in paraphiliac behavior separate from that involved in the offence, and they were more likely to have past convictions for sexual offences. Other studies have employed the sex-of-victim approach in the prediction of future risk, with offenders who have sexually abused boys or both boys and girls reported as having more victims and being at greater risk of reoffending than those who had offended against girls only [bibliographic references omitted]. In the nondiagnostic remarks, DSM-IV (APA, 1994) claims that the recidivism rate for male-victim offenders is approximately twice that for female-victim offenders, and although not demonstrating such a marked difference, Furby,Weinrott, and Blackshaw (1989), in an extensive review of recidivism rates, found that reoffending was higher for male victim offenders. [\u00b6] However, the sex-of-victim distinction has not been consistently found, and contrasting findings have been reported in studies that have demonstrated no differences in recidivism rates between the groups [bibliographic references omitted]. Furthermore, Abel, Becker, Murphy, and Flanagan (1981) found that those child molesters who offended against girls reported more than twice as many victims as those who had offended against boys, a finding contrary to the hypothesized outcome.\" (p. 56)\n \n \n 8. Jay & Young. (1977). The gay report: Lesbians and gay men speak out about sexual experiences and lifestyles. New York: Summit.\n \n This book, published nearly 30 years ago by a team of writer-activists, is not a scientific study. The authors' survey methodology is not reported in detail and, because it was a journalistic work, the survey was never subjected to scientific peer review.\n \n \n 9. Erickson et al. (1988). Behavior patterns of child molesters. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 17, 77-86.\n \n This study was based on a retrospective review of the medical records of male sex offenders admitted to the Minnesota Security Hospital between 1975 and 1984. Apparently, 70% of the men abused girls, 26% abused boys, and 4% abused children of both sexes. (The paper is unclear in that it doesn't explain how perpetrators with multiple victims were counted.) The paper asserts in passing that \"Eighty-six percent of offenders against males described themselves as homosexual or bisexual\" (p. 83). However, no details are provided about how this information was ascertained, making it difficult to interpret. Nor did the authors report the number of homosexual versus bisexual offenders, a distinction that the Groth and Birnbaum study (described above) indicates is relevant.\n \n \n \n In summary, the scientific sources cited by the FRC report do not support their argument. Most of the studies they referenced did not even assess the sexual orientation of abusers. Two studies explicitly concluded that sexual orientation and child molestation are unrelated. Notably, the FRC failed to cite the 1978 study by Groth and Birnbaum, which also contradicted their argument. Only one study (Erickson et al., 1988) might be interpreted as supporting the FRC argument, and it failed to detail its measurement procedures and did not differentiate bisexual from homosexual offenders.\n \n Do Any Studies Claim To Show That Homosexuals Are More Likely To Molest Children?\n \n One individual has claimed to have data that prove homosexuals to be child molesters at a higher rate than heterosexuals. That person is Paul Cameron. As detailed elsewhere on this site, Cameron's survey data are subject to so many methodological flaws as to be virtually meaningless. Even so, his assertions are sometimes quoted by antigay organizations in their attempts to link homosexuality with child sexual abuse.\n \n In a 1985 article published in Psychological Reports, Cameron purported to review published data to answer the question, \"Do those who commit homosexual acts disproportionately incorporate children into their sexual practices?\" (p. 1227). He concluded that \"at least one-third of the sexual attacks upon youth are homosexual\" (p. 1228) and that \"those who are bi- to homosexual are proportionately much more apt to molest youth\" than are heterosexuals (p. 1231).\n \n Cameron's claims hinge on the fallacious assumption that all male-male molestations are committed by homosexuals. Moreover, a careful reading of Cameron's paper reveals several false statements about the literature he claimed to have reviewed.\n \n For example, he cited the Groth and Birnbaum (1978) study mentioned previously as evidencing a 3:2 ratio of \"heterosexual\" (i.e., female victim) to \"homosexual\" (i.e., male victim) molestations, and he noted that \"54% of all the molestations in this study were performed by bisexual or homosexual practitioners\" (p. 1231). However, Groth and Birnbaum reported that none of the men in their sample had an exclusively homosexual adult sexual orientation, and that none of the 22 bisexual men were more attracted to adult males than to adult females. The \"54%\" statistic reported by Cameron doesn't appear anywhere in the Groth and Birnbaum (1978) article, nor does Cameron explain its derivation.\n \n It is also noteworthy that, although Cameron assumed that the perpetrators of male-male molestations were all homosexual, he assumed that not all male-female molestations were committed by heterosexuals. He incorporated a \"bisexual correction\" into his data manipulations to increase further his estimate of the risk posed to children by homosexual/bisexual men.\n \n In the latter half of his paper, Cameron considered whether \"homosexual teachers have more frequent sexual interaction with their pupils\" (p. 1231). Based on 30 instances of sexual contact between a teacher and pupil reported in ten different sources published between 1920 and 1982, Cameron concluded that \"a pupil would appear about 90 times more likely to be sexually assaulted by a homosexual practitioner\" (p.1232); the ratio rose to 100 times when Cameron added his bisexual correction.\n \n This ratio is meaningless because no data were obtained concerning the actual sexual orientation of the teachers involved; as before, Cameron assumed that male-male contacts were perpetrated by homosexuals. Furthermore, Cameron's rationale for selecting particular sources appears to have been completely arbitrary. He described no systematic method for reviewing the literature, and apparently never reviewed the voluminous literature on the sexual development of children and adolescents. His final choice of sources appears to have slanted his findings toward what Cameron described as \"the relative absence in the scientific literature of heterosexual teacher-pupil sexual events coupled with persistent, albeit infrequent, homosexual teacher-pupil sexual interactions\" (p. 1232).\n \n A subsequent paper by Cameron and others (Cameron, Proctor, Coburn, Forde, Larson, & Cameron, 1986) described data collected in a door-to-door survey in seven U.S. cities and towns, and generally repeated the conclusions reached in Cameron (1985). Even Cameron himself admitted that his conclusions in this study are \"based upon small numbers of data points\" (Cameron, 2005, p. 230). As before, male-male sexual assaults were referred to as \"homosexual\" molestations (e.g., Abstract, p.327) and the perpetrators' sexual orientation apparently was not assessed. This study also suffers from fatal methodological problems, which are detailed elsewhere on this site.\n \n In yet another article published in Psychological Reports, Cameron claimed to have reviewed data about foster parents in Illinois and found that 34% were perpetrated by a foster parent against a child of the same sex, that is, female-female or male-male (Cameron, 2005). Not only did Cameron again make the fallacious claim that all male-male molestations are committed by homosexuals, he also made the same claim about female-female molestations. Once again, he had no data about the actual sexual orientations of the molesters.\n \n Cameron continues to produce reports that essentially repeat the same inaccurate claims. Perhaps one of the best indicators of his diminishing credibility in this area is that his work was not cited in the 2004 FRC report discussed in detail above.\n \n \n Conclusion\n \n The empirical research does not show that gay or bisexual men are any more likely than heterosexual men to molest children. This is not to argue that homosexual and bisexual men never molest children. But there is no scientific basis for asserting that they are more likely than heterosexual men to do so. And, as explained above, many child molesters cannot be characterized as having an adult sexual orientation at all; they are fixated on children.\n \n \n Notes\n \n 1. The survey was conducted under the auspices of the Kinsey Institute (Klassen, Williams, & Levitt, 1989). (return to text)\n \n 2. Sexual abuse by women occurs but has not been well documented. Perhaps it is not surprising, therefore, that the child molester stereotype is applied more often to gay men than to lesbians. (return to text)",

   "1) It is the PSYCHOLOGICAL STANDARD to understand that a pedophile's sexual orientation is NOT determined by his choice in victims.\n \n <<Preference for children as sex partners may not be exclusive, and more often than not, pedophiles have no gender preference in prepubescent children. However, by a margin greater than two to one, most victims are girls. Moreover, the pedophile is usually a relative, friend, or neighbor of the child's family.<<\n Pedophilia | Encyclopedia of Psychology | Find Articles at BNET\n \n They aren't \"homosexual\" because to a pedophile, the gender of his prey is virtually irrelevant.\n \n Heterosexual married fathers who have never had \"gay\" sex with an adult in their life can AND DO molest their sons. Some people would blindly tell you that they were \"gay\" and ignore the reality of the situation.\n \n \n 2) In addition, the \"sexual orientation\" of a pedophile is often a misnomer. A \"pedophile's\" sexual orientation IS for \"kids\".\n \n <<The distinction between gender of victim and sexual orientation of perpetrator is important because many child molesters don't really have an adult sexual orientation. They have never developed the capacity for mature sexual relationships with other adults, either men or women.\n \n Recognizing this fact, Finkelhor and Araji (1986) proposed that discussions of the sexual attractions of perpetrators should be conceptualized along a continuum ranging in degrees from exclusive interest in children to exclusive interest in adult partners.<<\n Facts About Homosexuality and Child Molestation",

   "Gee, a militant homosexual source. How quaint. emoticon_xgood Sexual Orientation: Science, Education, and Policy\n \n \nFacts About Homosexuality and Child Molestation\n \n Facts About Homosexuality and Child Molestation\n \n Members of disliked minority groups are often stereotyped as representing a danger to the majority's most vulnerable members. For example, Jews in the Middle Ages were accused of murdering Christian babies in ritual sacrifices. Black men in the United States were often lynched after being falsely accused of raping White women.\n \n In a similar fashion, gay people have often been portrayed as a threat to children. Back in 1977, when Anita Bryant campaigned successfully to repeal a Dade County (FL) ordinance prohibiting anti-gay discrimination, she named her organization \"Save Our Children,\" and warned that \"a particularly deviant-minded [gay] teacher could sexually molest children\" (Bryant, 1977, p. 114). [Bibliographic references are on a different web page]\n \n In recent years, antigay activists have routinely asserted that gay people are child molesters. This argument was often made in debates about the Boy Scouts of America's policy to exclude gay scouts and scoutmasters. More recently, in the wake of Rep. Mark Foley's resignation from the US House of Representatives in 2006, antigay activists and their supporters seized on the scandal to revive this canard.\n \n It has also been raised in connection with scandals about the Catholic church's attempts to cover up the abuse of young males by priests. Indeed, the Vatican's early response to the 2002 revelations of widespread Church cover-ups of sexual abuse by priests was to declare that gay men should not be ordained.\n \n \n Public belief in\n the stereotype The number of Americans who believe the myth that gay people are child molesters has declined substantially. In a 1970 national survey, more than 70% of respondents agreed with the assertions that \"Homosexuals are dangerous as teachers or youth leaders because they try to get sexually involved with children\" or that \"Homosexuals try to play sexually with children if they cannot get an adult partner.\"1\n \n By contrast, in a 1999 national poll, the belief that most gay men are likely to molest or abuse children was endorsed by only 19% of heterosexual men and 10% of heterosexual women. Even fewer - 9% of men and 6% of women - regarded most lesbians as child molesters.\n \n Consistent with these findings, Gallup polls have found that an increasing number of Americans would allow gay people to be elementary school teachers. For example, the proportion was 54% in 2005, compared to 27% in 1977.\n \n Examining the\n Research Even though most Americans don't regard gay people as child molesters, confusion remains widespread in this area. To understand the facts, it is important to examine the results of scientific research. However, when we evaluate research on child molestation, our task is complicated by several problems.\n \n One problem is that none of the studies in this area have obtained data from a probability sample, that is, a sample that can be assumed to be representative of the population of all child molesters. Rather, most research has been conducted only with convicted perpetrators or with pedophiles who sought professional help. Consequently, they may not accurately describe child molesters who have never been caught or have not sought treatment.\n \n Terminology A second problem is that the terminology used in this area is often confusing and can even be misleading. We can begin to address that problem by defining some basic terms.\n \n Pedophilia and child molestation are used in different ways, even by professionals. Pedophilia usually refers to an adult psychological disorder characterized by a preference for prepubescent children as sexual partners; this preference may or may not be acted upon. The term hebephilia is sometimes used to describe adult sexual attractions to adolescents or children who have reached puberty.\n \n Whereas pedophilia and hebephilia refer to psychological propensities, child molestation and child sexual abuse are used to describe actual sexual contact between an adult and someone who has not reached the legal age of consent. In this context, the latter individual is referred to as a child, even though he or she may be a teenager.\n \n Although the terms are not always applied consistently, it is useful to distinguish between pedophiles/hebephiles and child molesters/abusers. Pedophilia and hebephilia are diagnostic labels that refer to psychological attractions. Not all pedophiles and hebephiles actually molest children; an adult can be attracted to children or adolescents without ever actually engaging in sexual contact with them.\n \n Child molestation and child sexual abuse refer to actions, and don't imply a particular psychological makeup or motive on the part of the perpetrator. Not all incidents of child sexual abuse are perpetrated by pedophiles or hebephiles; in some cases, the perpetrator has other motives for his or her actions and does not manifest an ongoing pattern of sexual attraction to children.\n \n Thus, not all child sexual abuse is perpetrated by pedophiles (or hebephiles) and not all pedophiles and hebephiles actually commit abuse. Consequently, it is important to use terminology carefully.\n \n Another problem related to terminology arises because sexual abuse of male children by adult men2 is often referred to as \"homosexual molestation.\" The adjective \"homosexual\" (or \"heterosexual\" when a man abuses a female child) refers to the victim's gender in relation to that of the perpetrator. Unfortunately, people sometimes mistakenly interpret it as referring to the perpetrator's sexual orientation.\n \n To avoid this confusion, it is preferable to refer to men's sexual abuse of boys with the more accurate label of male-male molestation. Similarly, it is preferable to refer to men's abuse of girls as male-female molestation. These labels are more accurate because they describe the sex of the individuals involved but don't implicitly convey unwarranted assumptions about the perpetrator's sexual orientation.\n \n Typologies of\n Offenders The distinction between a victim's gender and a perpetrator's sexual orientation is important because many child molesters don't really have an adult sexual orientation. They have never developed the capacity for mature sexual relationships with other adults, either men or women. Instead, their sexual attractions focus on children - boys, girls, or children of both sexes.\n \n Over the years, this fact has been incorporated into various systems for categorizing child molesters. For example, Finkelhor and Araji (1986) proposed that perpetrators' sexual attractions should be conceptualized as ranging along a continuum - from exclusive interest in children at one extreme, to exclusive interest in adult partners at the other end.\n \n Typologies of offenders have often included a distinction between those with an enduring primary preference for children as sexual partners and those who have established age-appropriate relationships but become sexually involved with children under unusual circumstances of extreme stress. Perpetrators in the first category - those with a more or less exclusive interest in children - have been labeled fixated. Fixation means \"a temporary or permanent arrestment of psychological maturation resulting from unresolved formative issues which persist and underlie the organization of subsequent phases of development\" (Groth & Birnbaum, 1978, p. 176). Many clinicians view fixated offenders as being \"stuck\" at an early stage of psychological development.\n \n By contrast, other molesters are described as regressed. Regression is \"a temporary or permanent appearance of primitive behavior after more mature forms of expression had been attained, regardless of whether the immature behavior was actually manifested earlier in the individual's development\" (Groth & Birnbaum, 1978, p. 177). Regressed offenders have developed an adult sexual orientation but under certain conditions (such as extreme stress) they return to an earlier, less mature psychological state and engage in sexual contact with children.\n \n Some typologies of child molesters divide the fixation-regression distinction into multiple categories, and some include additional categories as well (e.g., Knight, 1989).\n \n For the present discussion, the important point is that many child molesters cannot be meaningfully described as homosexuals, heterosexuals, or bisexuals (in the usual sense of those terms) because they are not really capable of a relationship with an adult man or woman. Instead of gender, their sexual attractions are based primarily on age. These individuals - who are often characterized as fixated - are attracted to children, not to men or women.\n \n Using the fixated-regressed distinction, Groth and Birnbaum (1978) studied 175 adult males who were convicted in Massachusetts of sexual assault against a child. None of the men had an exclusively homosexual adult sexual orientation. 83 (47%) were classified as \"fixated;\" 70 others (40%) were classified as regressed adult heterosexuals; the remaining 22 (13%) were classified as regressed adult bisexuals. Of the last group, Groth and Birnbaum observed that \"in their adult relationships they engaged in sex on occasion with men as well as with women. However, in no case did this attraction to men exceed their preference for women....There were no men who were primarily sexually attracted to other adult males...\" (p.180).\n \n Other\n Approaches Other researchers have taken different approaches, but have similarly failed to find a connection between homosexuality and child molestation. Dr. Carole Jenny and her colleagues reviewed 352 medical charts, representing all of the sexually abused children seen in the emergency room or child abuse clinic of a Denver children's hospital during a one-year period (from July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1992). The molester was a gay or lesbian adult in fewer than 1% in which an adult molester could be identified - only 2 of the 269 cases (Jenny et al., 1994).\n \n In yet another approach to studying adult sexual attraction to children, some Canadian researchers observed how homosexual and heterosexual adult men responded to slides of males and females of various ages (child, pubescent, and mature adult). All of the research subjects were first screened to ensure that they preferred physically mature sexual partners. In some of the slides shown to subjects, the model was clothed; in others, he or she was nude. The slides were accompanied by audio recordings. The recordings paired with the nude models described an imaginary sexual interaction between the model and the subject. The recordings paired with the pictures of clothed models described the model engaging in neutral activities (e.g., swimming). To measure sexual arousal, changes in the subjects' penis volume were monitored while they watched the slides and listened to the audiotapes. The researchers found that homosexual males responded no more to male children than heterosexual males responded to female children (Freund et al., 1989).\n \n Science cannot prove a negative. Thus, these studies do not prove that homosexual or bisexual males are no more likely than heterosexual males to molest children. However, each of them failed to prove the alternative hypothesis that homosexual males are more likely than heterosexual men to molest children or to be sexually attracted to children or adolescents.\n \n The Mainstream\n View Reflecting the results of these and other studies, the mainstream view among researchers and professionals who work in the area of child sexual abuse is that homosexual and bisexual men do not pose any special threat to children. For example, in one review of the scientific literature, noted authority Dr. A. Nicholas Groth wrote:\n \n Are homosexual adults in general sexually attracted to children and are preadolescent children at greater risk of molestation from homosexual adults than from heterosexual adults? There is no reason to believe so. The research to date all points to there being no significant relationship between a homosexual lifestyle and child molestation. There appears to be practically no reportage of sexual molestation of girls by lesbian adults, and the adult male who sexually molests young boys is not likely to be homosexual (Groth & Gary, 1982, p. 147). \n \n In a more recent literature review, Dr. Nathaniel McConaghy (1998) similarly cautioned against confusing homosexuality with pedophilia. He noted, \"The man who offends against prepubertal or immediately postpubertal boys is typically not sexually interested in older men or in women\" (p. 259).\n \n This well known lack of a linkage between homosexuality and child molestation accounts for why relatively little research has directly addressed the issue. Proving something we already know simply isn't a priority. Indeed, a commentary that accompanied publication of the 1994 study by Jenny et al. in Pediatrics noted that debates about gay people as molesters \"have little to do with everyday child abuse\" and lamented that they distract lawmakers and the public from dealing with the real problem of children's sexual mistreatment (Krugman, 1994).\n \n Other\n Sexual Abuse In scandals involving the Catholic church, the victims of sexual abuse were often adolescent boys rather than small children. Similarly, the 2006 congressional page scandal involved males who were at least 16 years old.\n \n These are cases in which the term pedophilia - referring as it does to attractions to prepubescent children - can cause confusion. Rather than pedophilia, the accusations stemming from these scandals raised the question of whether gay people shouldn't be trusted in positions of authority where there is any opportunity for sexually harassing or abusing others.\n \n Here again, there is no inherent connection between an adult's sexual orientation and her or his propensity for endangering others. Scientific research provides no evidence that homosexual people are less likely than heterosexuals to exercise good judgment and appropriate discretion in their employment settings. There are no data, for example, showing that gay men and lesbians are more likely than heterosexual men and women to sexually harass their subordinates in the workplace. Data from studies using a variety of psychological measures do not indicate that gay people are more likely than heterosexuals to possess any psychological characteristics that would make them less capable of controlling their sexual urges, refraining from the abuse of power, obeying rules and laws, interacting effectively with others, or exercising good judgment in handling authority. As explained elsewhere on this site, sexual orientation is not a mental illness nor is it inherently associated with impaired psychological functioning.\n \n Gay men and lesbians function effectively in a wide variety of employment settings. The research literature doesn't reveal any differences between heterosexuals, bisexuals, and homosexuals in job performance or ability to properly exercise authority in supervisory roles. As indicated by workplace policies around the United States, a large and growing number of private and public employers do not perceive a problem with hiring gay and bisexual people as employees or managers. Many corporations, educational institutions, and local governments have adopted policies that prohibit discrimination against employees on the basis of sexual orientation. Many of those organizations provide benefits such as health insurance for employees' same-sex partners. Indeed, one widely cited reason for offering such benefits is that they enable a company to remain competitive by attracting high quality employees who happen to be gay, lesbian, or bisexual.\n \n Thus, there is no factual basis for organizations to avoid hiring homosexual or bisexual people, simply on the basis of their sexual orientation, for positions that involve responsibility for or supervision of others, whether children, adolescents, or adults.\n \n What About Claims That Scientific Research Proves Gay Men Are Likely To Molest Children?\n \n Some conservative groups have argued that scientific research strongly supports their claims that homosexuality and pedophilia are linked. The Family Research Council has produced what is perhaps the most extensive attempt to document this claim. It is an article by Timothy J. Dailey titled Homosexuality and Child Abuse.\n \n With 76 footnotes, many of them referring to papers in scientific journals, it appears at first glance to be a thorough and scholarly discussion of the issue. On further examination, however, its central argument - that \"the evidence indicates that homosexual men molest boys at rates grossly disproportionate to the rates at which heterosexual men molest girls\" - doesn't hold up.\n \n In the following section, the main sources cited by Dailey and the FRC to support their claim are reviewed. The papers are listed in the same order in which they are first cited by the FRC article.\n \n 1. Freund et al. (1989). Heterosexuality, homosexuality, and erotic age preference. Journal of Sex Research, 26, 107-117.\n \n This article is discussed above in the \"Other Approaches\" section. As the FRC concedes, it contradicts their argument. The abstract summarizes the authors' conclusion: \"Findings indicate that homosexual males who preferred mature partners responded no more to male children than heterosexual males who preferred mature partners responded to female children.\"\n \n \n 2. Silverthorne & Quinsey. (2000). Sexual partner age preferences of homosexual and heterosexual men and women. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 29, 67-76.\n \n The FRC cites this study to challenge the Freund et al. data (see the previous paper above). However, the methodologies were quite different. Freund and his colleagues used a sample that included sex offenders and they assessed sexual arousal with a physiological measure similar to that described below for the 1988 Marshall et al. study. Silverthorne and Quinsey used a sample of community volunteers who were asked to view pictures of human faces and use a 7-point scale to rate their sexual attractiveness. The apparent ages of the people portrayed in the pictures was originally estimated by Dr. Silverthorne to range from 15 to 50. However, a group of independent raters perceived the male faces to range in age from 18 to 58, and the female faces to range from 19 to 60.\n \n The article doesn't report the data in great detail (e.g., average ratings are depicted only in a graphic; the actual numbers aren't reported) and the authors provide contradictory information about the rating scale (they describe it as a 7-point scale but also say it ranged from 0 to 7, which constitutes an 8-point scale). In either case, it appears that none of the pictures was rated as \"very sexually attractive\" (a rating of 7). Rather, the highest average ratings were approximately 5.\n \n On average, gay men rated the 18-year old male faces the most attractive (average rating = about 5), with attractiveness ratings declining steadily for older faces. They rated the 58-year old male faces 2, on average. By contrast, heterosexual men rated the 25-year old female faces the most attractive (about 5), with the 18- and 28-year old female faces rated lower (between 2 and 3) and the 60-year old female faces rated the least attractive (about 1).\n \n A serious problem with this study is that the researchers didn't control for the possibility that some of the faces pictured in the photos might simply have been more or less physically attractive than the others, independent of their age or gender. The researchers explicitly acknowledged this shortcoming, speculating that the women's faces in the 25-year old group might have been more attractive than women's faces in the other age groups. But they didn't address the possibility that the attractiveness of the male and female faces may not have been comparable.\n \n This issue could have been addressed in various ways. For example, prior to collecting data, the researchers could have started with a large number of photographs and asked a group of independent raters to evaluate the general physical attractiveness of the face in each photo; these ratings could have been used to select photos for the experiment that were equivalent in attractiveness. Getting independent ratings of experimental stimuli in this way is a common procedure in social psychological research.\n \n Thus, even if one accepts the questionable assumption that this study is relevant, it doesn't support the FRC's contention that gay men are more likely than heterosexual men to be child molesters for several reasons:\n * the researchers failed to control for the varying attractiveness of the different photos;\n * all of the faces portrayed in the photos were perceived to be at least 18; and\n * the study merely assessed judgments of sexual attractiveness rather than the research participants' sexual arousal. \n \n \n 3. Blanchard et al. (2000). Fraternal birth order and sexual orientation in pedophiles. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 29, 463-478.\n \n This study categorized convicted sex offenders according to whether they molested or reported sexual attraction to boys only, girls only, or both boys and girls. These groups were labeled, respectively, homosexual pedophiles, heterosexual pedophiles, and bisexual pedophiles. This classification referred to their attractions to children. Adult sexual orientation (or even whether the men had an adult sexual orientation) wasn't assessed.\n \n \n 4. Elliott et al. (1995). Child sexual abuse prevention: What offenders tell us. Child Abuse & Neglect, 19, 579-594.\n \n In this study, child sex offenders were interviewed. Their sexual orientation (gay, heterosexual, bisexual) wasn't assessed. The authors drew from their findings to suggest strategies for how parents and children can prevent sexual victimization. It is noteworthy that none of those strategies involved avoiding gay men.\n \n \n 5. Jenny et al. (1994). Are children at risk for sexual abuse by homosexuals? Pediatrics, 94, 41-44.\n \n This study, described above in the section on \"Other Approaches,\" contradicts the FRC's argument. The FRC faults the study because the researchers didn't directly interview perpetrators but instead relied on the victims' medical charts for information about the offender's sexual orientation. However, other studies cited favorably by the FRC (and summarized in this section) similarly relied on chart data (Erickson et al., 1988) or did not directly assess the sexual orientation of perpetrators (Blanchard et al. 2000; Elliott et al. 1995; Marshall et al., 1988). Thus, the FRC apparently considers this method a weakness only when it leads to results they dislike.\n \n \n 6. Marshall et al. (1988). Sexual offenders against male children: Sexual preference. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 26, 383-391.\n \n In this study, the researchers compared 21 men who had sexually molested a male under 16 years (and at least 5 years younger than themselves) to 18 unemployed men who were not known to have molested a child. Over a series of sessions, each man watched color slides of nude males and females of various ages and listened to audiotaped descriptions of both coercive and consensual sexual interactions between a man and a boy. During the sessions, each man sat in a private booth, where he was instructed to lower his trousers and underwear and attach a rubber tube to his penis. The tube detected any changes in penis circumference, with increases interpreted as indicating sexual arousal.\n \n The FRC cites this study as showing that \"a homosexual and a heterosexual subgroup can be delineated among these offenders.\" This is true but hardly relevant to their claims.\n \n The researchers categorized 7 offenders who were more aroused overall by the male nudes than the female nudes as the homosexual subgroup. They categorized 14 offenders who were more aroused overall by the female nudes as the heterosexual subgroup. The offenders were not asked their sexual orientation (gay, straight, bisexual) and the paper does not report any information about the nature of the offenders' adult sexual relationships, or even if they had any such relationships.\n \n \n 7. Bickley & Beech. (2001). Classifying child abusers: Its relevance to theory and clinical practice. International Journal Of Offender Therapy And Comparative Criminology, 45, 51-69.\n \n This is a literature review and theoretical paper that discusses the strengths and weaknesses of various systems for classifying child molesters. In citing this study, the FRC says it:\n \n refers to homosexual pedophiles as a \"distinct group.\" The victims of homosexual pedophiles \"were more likely to be strangers, that they were more likely to have engaged in paraphiliac behavior separate from that involved in the offence, and that they were more likely to have past convictions for sexual offences.... Other studies [showed a] greater risk of reoffending than those who had offended against girls\" and that the \"recidivism rate for male-victim offenders is approximately twice that for female-victim offenders.\" \n \n In reality, however, the paper was summarizing the findings of other studies, not reporting new data. In the passage excerpted by the FRC, the authors were discussing published papers that used a classification system focusing entirely on the sex of victims (not whether the perpetrator is straight or gay). Here is the complete text (the passages that FRC omitted are highlighted):\n \n \"Grubin and Kennedy (1991) reported that when dividing sex offenders based simply on the sex of their victims, offenders against boys stood out as a distinct group. They noted that their victims were more likely to be strangers, that they were more likely to have engaged in paraphiliac behavior separate from that involved in the offence, and they were more likely to have past convictions for sexual offences. Other studies have employed the sex-of-victim approach in the prediction of future risk, with offenders who have sexually abused boys or both boys and girls reported as having more victims and being at greater risk of reoffending than those who had offended against girls only [bibliographic references omitted]. In the nondiagnostic remarks, DSM-IV (APA, 1994) claims that the recidivism rate for male-victim offenders is approximately twice that for female-victim offenders, and although not demonstrating such a marked difference, Furby,Weinrott, and Blackshaw (1989), in an extensive review of recidivism rates, found that reoffending was higher for male victim offenders. [\u00b6] However, the sex-of-victim distinction has not been consistently found, and contrasting findings have been reported in studies that have demonstrated no differences in recidivism rates between the groups [bibliographic references omitted]. Furthermore, Abel, Becker, Murphy, and Flanagan (1981) found that those child molesters who offended against girls reported more than twice as many victims as those who had offended against boys, a finding contrary to the hypothesized outcome.\" (p. 56)\n \n \n 8. Jay & Young. (1977). The gay report: Lesbians and gay men speak out about sexual experiences and lifestyles. New York: Summit.\n \n This book, published nearly 30 years ago by a team of writer-activists, is not a scientific study. The authors' survey methodology is not reported in detail and, because it was a journalistic work, the survey was never subjected to scientific peer review.\n \n \n 9. Erickson et al. (1988). Behavior patterns of child molesters. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 17, 77-86.\n \n This study was based on a retrospective review of the medical records of male sex offenders admitted to the Minnesota Security Hospital between 1975 and 1984. Apparently, 70% of the men abused girls, 26% abused boys, and 4% abused children of both sexes. (The paper is unclear in that it doesn't explain how perpetrators with multiple victims were counted.) The paper asserts in passing that \"Eighty-six percent of offenders against males described themselves as homosexual or bisexual\" (p. 83). However, no details are provided about how this information was ascertained, making it difficult to interpret. Nor did the authors report the number of homosexual versus bisexual offenders, a distinction that the Groth and Birnbaum study (described above) indicates is relevant.\n \n \n \n In summary, the scientific sources cited by the FRC report do not support their argument. Most of the studies they referenced did not even assess the sexual orientation of abusers. Two studies explicitly concluded that sexual orientation and child molestation are unrelated. Notably, the FRC failed to cite the 1978 study by Groth and Birnbaum, which also contradicted their argument. Only one study (Erickson et al., 1988) might be interpreted as supporting the FRC argument, and it failed to detail its measurement procedures and did not differentiate bisexual from homosexual offenders.\n \n Do Any Studies Claim To Show That Homosexuals Are More Likely To Molest Children?\n \n One individual has claimed to have data that prove homosexuals to be child molesters at a higher rate than heterosexuals. That person is Paul Cameron. As detailed elsewhere on this site, Cameron's survey data are subject to so many methodological flaws as to be virtually meaningless. Even so, his assertions are sometimes quoted by antigay organizations in their attempts to link homosexuality with child sexual abuse.\n \n In a 1985 article published in Psychological Reports, Cameron purported to review published data to answer the question, \"Do those who commit homosexual acts disproportionately incorporate children into their sexual practices?\" (p. 1227). He concluded that \"at least one-third of the sexual attacks upon youth are homosexual\" (p. 1228) and that \"those who are bi- to homosexual are proportionately much more apt to molest youth\" than are heterosexuals (p. 1231).\n \n Cameron's claims hinge on the fallacious assumption that all male-male molestations are committed by homosexuals. Moreover, a careful reading of Cameron's paper reveals several false statements about the literature he claimed to have reviewed.\n \n For example, he cited the Groth and Birnbaum (1978) study mentioned previously as evidencing a 3:2 ratio of \"heterosexual\" (i.e., female victim) to \"homosexual\" (i.e., male victim) molestations, and he noted that \"54% of all the molestations in this study were performed by bisexual or homosexual practitioners\" (p. 1231). However, Groth and Birnbaum reported that none of the men in their sample had an exclusively homosexual adult sexual orientation, and that none of the 22 bisexual men were more attracted to adult males than to adult females. The \"54%\" statistic reported by Cameron doesn't appear anywhere in the Groth and Birnbaum (1978) article, nor does Cameron explain its derivation.\n \n It is also noteworthy that, although Cameron assumed that the perpetrators of male-male molestations were all homosexual, he assumed that not all male-female molestations were committed by heterosexuals. He incorporated a \"bisexual correction\" into his data manipulations to increase further his estimate of the risk posed to children by homosexual/bisexual men.\n \n In the latter half of his paper, Cameron considered whether \"homosexual teachers have more frequent sexual interaction with their pupils\" (p. 1231). Based on 30 instances of sexual contact between a teacher and pupil reported in ten different sources published between 1920 and 1982, Cameron concluded that \"a pupil would appear about 90 times more likely to be sexually assaulted by a homosexual practitioner\" (p.1232); the ratio rose to 100 times when Cameron added his bisexual correction.\n \n This ratio is meaningless because no data were obtained concerning the actual sexual orientation of the teachers involved; as before, Cameron assumed that male-male contacts were perpetrated by homosexuals. Furthermore, Cameron's rationale for selecting particular sources appears to have been completely arbitrary. He described no systematic method for reviewing the literature, and apparently never reviewed the voluminous literature on the sexual development of children and adolescents. His final choice of sources appears to have slanted his findings toward what Cameron described as \"the relative absence in the scientific literature of heterosexual teacher-pupil sexual events coupled with persistent, albeit infrequent, homosexual teacher-pupil sexual interactions\" (p. 1232).\n \n A subsequent paper by Cameron and others (Cameron, Proctor, Coburn, Forde, Larson, & Cameron, 1986) described data collected in a door-to-door survey in seven U.S. cities and towns, and generally repeated the conclusions reached in Cameron (1985). Even Cameron himself admitted that his conclusions in this study are \"based upon small numbers of data points\" (Cameron, 2005, p. 230). As before, male-male sexual assaults were referred to as \"homosexual\" molestations (e.g., Abstract, p.327) and the perpetrators' sexual orientation apparently was not assessed. This study also suffers from fatal methodological problems, which are detailed elsewhere on this site.\n \n In yet another article published in Psychological Reports, Cameron claimed to have reviewed data about foster parents in Illinois and found that 34% were perpetrated by a foster parent against a child of the same sex, that is, female-female or male-male (Cameron, 2005). Not only did Cameron again make the fallacious claim that all male-male molestations are committed by homosexuals, he also made the same claim about female-female molestations. Once again, he had no data about the actual sexual orientations of the molesters.\n \n Cameron continues to produce reports that essentially repeat the same inaccurate claims. Perhaps one of the best indicators of his diminishing credibility in this area is that his work was not cited in the 2004 FRC report discussed in detail above.\n \n \n Conclusion\n \n The empirical research does not show that gay or bisexual men are any more likely than heterosexual men to molest children. This is not to argue that homosexual and bisexual men never molest children. But there is no scientific basis for asserting that they are more likely than heterosexual men to do so. And, as explained above, many child molesters cannot be characterized as having an adult sexual orientation at all; they are fixated on children.\n \n \n Notes\n \n 1. The survey was conducted under the auspices of the Kinsey Institute (Klassen, Williams, & Levitt, 1989). (return to text)\n \n 2. Sexual abuse by women occurs but has not been well documented. Perhaps it is not surprising, therefore, that the child molester stereotype is applied more often to gay men than to lesbians. (return to text)\n",

As repeatedly pointed out, a large percentage MOLEST BOTH genders.\n The issue is not in preferring a \"gender\". Just because the victims happen to have a gender does not mean that the pedophile PREFERS that gender in other situations. (like those who like to see blood flow would only like red...)\n \n And coming from a different angle, your approach fails to recognize an important fact.\n MARRIED MEN who only have sex with women CAN and DO molest their sons.\n By your blind approach, you would ignore their HETEROSEXUAL action and declare them \"homosexual\".\n In fact, as pointed out the research EXAMINED their ADULT sexual interactions, and found that for the VAST MAJORITY of people who molest boys they sleep ONLY WITH ADULT WOMEN and never adult men.\n \n But you refuse to accept that.... emoticon_frazzled",

Did you read and comment on these damming quotes from homosexual activists who very openly state what the agenda is and should be regarding the desired dissolution of age of sexual consent laws? Can you produce other homosexual groups which exist in order to overtly oppose what these men have dedicated their lives to accomplishing?\n \n You would actually have us believe that because the larger homosexual community remains silent on this issue that they oppose it, but we all know that everything the larger community opposes, they attack with fervor in order to stop it. But no such voice exists within the homosexual community to stand against what North American Man Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) co-founder David Thorstad, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Professor Richard D. Mohr, and San Francisco journalist Bruce Mirken stands for.\n \n \nHere's the rub, and the evidence of your denial of reality. My evidence IS NOT anti-gay opinions. THEY ARE DIRECT QUOTES FROM HOMOSEXUALS AND PEDERASTS FROM WITHIN YOUR OWN HOMOSEXUAL COMMUNITY. BUT IN TYPICAL FASHION, YOU WILL ATTEMPT TO TEAR IT APART AND CRITIQUE IT AS IF IT'S MY SIDE MAKING THOSE VERY DAMMING STATEMENTS WHICH DO INDICT YOUR COMMUNITY FOR ACCEPTING AND ENDORSING THIS ACTIVITY WHEN THEY THINK WE STRAIGHTS AREN'T WATCHING. HERE IT IS AGAIN, TRY READING WHAT YOUR COHORTS SAID FOR COMPREHENSION.\n NAMBLA And\n Homosexual Activism\n \n \n Pedophiles And Homosexual Activists Push For Total Sexual Liberation\n \n The effort to abolish \"age of consent\" laws has been a long-time goal of homosexual activists. The 1972 Gay Rights Platform, for example, called for the abolition of all laws prohibiting sex with children. The platform demands: \"Repeal of all laws governing the age of sexual consent.\"\n \n In September, 1995, three homosexual activists published an essay entitled, \"The State Of Gay Liberation\" in Guide, a homosexual publication. The essay was authored by North American Man Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) co-founder David Thorstad, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Professor Richard D. Mohr, and San Francisco journalist Bruce Mirken.\n \n Thorstad, of course, is a life-long pederast and homosexual activist who clearly describes the important linkage between homosexuality and pedophilia. In a speech given before a homosexual group in Mexico in 1998, Thorstad said: \"Pederasty is the main form that male homosexuality has acquired throughout Western civilization-and not only in the West! Pederasty is inseparable from the high points of Western culture-ancient Greece and the Renaissance.\" (David Thorstad, \"Pederasty And Homosexuality,\" NAMBLA web site)\n \n Fellow author Professor Richard Mohr, is a homosexual activist who is an advocate for same-sex marriage and has said he hopes that homosexual marriage will help define \"monogamy\" out of marriage altogether. (Stanley Kurtz, \"Beyond Gay Marriage,\" The Weekly Standard, Aug. 4-11, 2003)\n \n Bruce Mirken is a homosexual and San Francisco journalist who was arrested in 1998 for attempting to have sex with a 13-year-old boy he had contacted through the Internet. When he entered a Sacramento park to sodomize the boy, he was met by police who had been tracking his activities on the Internet. The charges were eventually dropped against him on a technicality.\n \n Sexual Liberation For Children\n \n Thorstad and Professor Mohr want sexual liberation for children and Mirken believes that AIDS activism is what will help perpetuate and strengthen the homosexual movement.\n \n According to David Thorstad, in \"The State Of Gay Liberation,\" homosexuals must get back to a \"radical vision of sexual freedom for all. We need to reaffirm our place in the great variety of same-sex behaviors that exist-have always existed-in human societies. We dare not allow our homosexual gift to be alienated from us by the limited vision, stifling political correctness, and erotophobic provincialism.\" In short, homosexuals should openly support the promotion of adult/child sex!\n \n Professor Mohr argues that the use of \"gay youth\" is a key to gaining political and cultural victories in the U.S. He writes: \"...these brave youth are key to culture's change on gay issues. Thanks to them, increasingly people know someone for whom being gay is an issue. Thanks to them the gay movement is achieving critical mass.\" Bruce Mirken claims that radical AIDS activism is what will save the homosexual movement from decline.\n \n The effort to push adult/child sex isn't limited to these three homosexual activists. It is part of the overall homosexual movement. As author Mary Eberstadt wrote in \"Pedophilia Chic: Reconsidered\" in The Weekly Standard, (Jan. 1, 2001): \"The reason why the public is being urged to reconsider boy pedophilia is that this 'question,' settled though it may be in the opinions and laws of the rest of the country, is demonstrably not yet settled within certain parts of the gay rights movement.\" Eberstadt notes that as the homosexual movement becomes more mainstream, this \"question\" about adult/child sex will become more prominent. Homosexuals who desire sex with children will do exactly what the ACLU is doing in Kansas: Destroy all laws banning sex between adults and children.Exposed: Homosexual Urban Legend: NAMBLA And Homosexual Activism\n",

They called themselves \"gay\" in order to garner support for an uprising movement.\n NO modern gay rights group supports pedophilia, so just be honest about this and stop throwing that junk out there.\n \n \n \nIn September, 1995, three homosexual activists published an essay entitled, \"The State Of Gay Liberation\" in Guide, a homosexual publication.

I can't find it.\n I imagine that if it exists, I would no doubt hate it and plug plenty of holes in it, but the fact that a gay man arguing AGAINST pedophilia would be lost on Archie.\n \n \n \nThorstad, of course, is a life-long pederast and homosexual activist ...\n\n This is another repugnant practice that is employed.\n Somebody takes a PEDOPHILE, one of the guy who started NAMBLA, and BLINDLY starts claiming he is a \"homosexual activist\".\n This guy started NAMBLA.\n \n Can you name me ANY gay rights cause this guy has actually fought for???\n He does NOT fight for gay rights. He is NOT a \"homosexual activist\".\n He is a PEDOPHILE.\n I would be really surprised if this guy has EVER had an adult relationship. It has been previously pointed out to you that a lot of these pedophiles DO NOT have adult relationships, but you ignored THAT as well...\n \n \n \nIn a speech given before a homosexual group in Mexico in 1998...\n\n MEXICO???\n And WHAT \"homosexual group\"?\n HOW MANY people were there???\n There are ABSOLUTELY NO DETAILS here to even attempt to think about verifying what actually happened...\n \n \n \nProfessor Mohr argues that the use of \"gay youth\" is a key to gaining political and cultural victories in the U.S. He writes: \"...these brave youth are key to culture's change on gay issues.
