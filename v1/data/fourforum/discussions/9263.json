   "[The following is an essay I plan to submit to Hamline University, a liberal arts college in St. Paul. I'm open to any pointers you guys have.]\n \n \n \"Prepare to be upset,\" I whispered to Chris from the chair beside him.\n \n He nodded and leaned back, his face bearing a grave expression. So far, the results of the state tournament were looking anything but good. Several teams had already won more than one All-State award, yet Buffalo lagged behind at zero. We watched with disbelief as members from teams we had defeated marched up to the front of the Marriott Hotel's dining room to claim their personal trophy and pose for a picture with former Justice Sandy Keith. Our coach, Ms. Raymond, wore a puzzled smile and kept shaking her head.\n \n Not a single one of us doubted that we deserved to be there, of course. It was the Buffalo High School's first time in the Minnesota Mock Trial State Tournament since 1994, but with the help of an experienced coach, we had fought for every inch of ground in the regional competitions and had made it. According to the tournament staff, our team had not been crushed by State regulars, either. Three trials later, after supposedly overcoming Perham, Apple Valley, and Meadow Creek Christian Academy-a team that had placed third at nationals two years before-we sat in our best attire with the top twelve teams in the state of Minnesota, waiting for the answer to that one question the luncheon was all about<b></b>: Which two teams will go on?\n \n The All-State trophies on the table trickled away one by one, and when the last award recipient was called, my team mates glanced at one another in agony. We were the only team that had not received any awards. How we turned up with such bad luck continues to elude me, but the cards didn't stay stacked against us for long.\n \n The final words eventually found their way to the tip of Judge James Dehn's tongue. All eyes zeroed in on his face and the noise died. The clothes I wore felt like a sauna.\n \n \"The defense is... Minneapolis South High.\"\n \n The table next to us exploded into relief. Few of us (if anyone in the room) understood why, however. South was the sun of the Minnesota solar system-the Hamline University version of a high school mock trial team. Five out of the last eight state championships belonged to South. In ninth grade, my first year on Buffalo's mock trial team, we faced South in a regional competition with the goal of losing by under 80 points (and we failed). \n \n South's opponent would be the big news. Meadow Creek Christian Academy had always battled them for the championship in the past. The whole room envied South and yearned for a fresh winner.\n \n \"The plaintiff is...\" Judge Dehn declared, \"Buffalo.\"\n \n I can't remember my own reaction, though I do remember the reaction of everyone else on the team. Flabbergasted, Bryant, our team captain, remained in his chair with an open jaw. Jeremy leaped to his feet with a yell and slapped Chris on the back while Jacob and Jessica clapped in stunned silence. As she shook the hands of coaches on opposing teams, Ms. Raymond wept.\n \n The trial against Minneapolis South was undoubtedly our most difficult of the season, and we lost. From our perspective, however, the silver medals didn't look any worse than the gold. Initially, our goal had been to make it halfway through regions. At state, we had hoped to walk away with at least one win.\n \n Buffalo's mock trial team is just as competitive now as it was last season. This year, I am one of the team's captains, and our eyes are already set on the state championship. To prepare, several members of our team attended a collegiate-level national tournament at the Hennepin County Government Center last year. I was fortunate enough to observe Hamline University's team in action, and I've been interested in both collegiate mock trial and Hamline ever since. In addition to the tournament I witnessed, my high school team also attended a mock trial camp at Hamline University over the weekend of November 17, 2006, and I had the opportunity to take a tour of the campus, meet Hamline's mock trial coach, and get to know some of the team members.\n \n Beyond the outstanding reputation of Hamline's mock trial team, I'm looking for a liberal arts education because my interests extend well beyond law and speech. I enjoy writing. Since Middle School, I've completed several short stories and novels. I've even tried to combine my education in the German language with my writing.\n \n In school, I try to take the most challenging classes available. This year, for instance, five of my eight classes are college courses through the University of Minnesota and Southwest State, which include an intermediate course of German, a democracy course that Ms. Raymond happens to teach, microeconomics, psychology, and a college preparatory writing course.\n \n I'm considering writing, international business, and law as possible careers, and that puts me at an advantage if I attend Hamline. Nevertheless, I've tried to keep my education broad because the truth is that I don't know what I want to do after college. Whatever path I find myself on, however, I know what kind of person I want to be. I want to be an open-minded individual with a passion for learning and understanding; I want to be someone with a compassionate, enlightened perspective of the world. I believe Hamline University will help instill all of those qualities in me.",
