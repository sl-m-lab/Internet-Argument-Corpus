It did not get screwed up under Carter, he inherited it that way, and quite frankly Paul Volker FIXED it under Carter. It just took a few yours for it to show up. \n \n When Carter went to appoint a chairman for the federal reserve he had 2 criteria...that is be somebody who is knowledgeable and that it be somebody of unimpeachable character. \n \n In economic circles Volker is widely viewed as the most knowledgeable person on the planet when it comes to the US economy.\n \n Frankly this posts exposes the depths of your stupidity when it comes to economic matters.",

Turns out his move actually did work and helped our economy in the long run. He is a smart guy and has good sense. I'm not too sure about the stance of tougher regulation was needed to prevent this crisis.\n \n In any event, the guy is old...why doesn't he retire :)...I'll be damned if I'm working at 81",
