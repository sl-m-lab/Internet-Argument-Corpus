   "The way I see it, if there were regulations that permitted exceptions due to religious beliefs it may favor one religion over another and unintentionally produce a state sponsored religion.\n \n Certainly christians (at least most of them) do not have any requirement for head coverings. Whereas Orthodox judaism and certain islamic sects do require it. \n \n Current Laws do not account for religious differences at all.\n \n However, the dress code was intended to curb gang activity. Banning one item of gang paraphenalia will only lead to the development of another.",

The issue is that the rule is intended to deal with Gangs. It cannot becaue they find other ways.
