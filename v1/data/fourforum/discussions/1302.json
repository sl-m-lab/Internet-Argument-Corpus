   "The economic problem with privatized education is that education is commonly aknowledged as a good with external gains. That is, the market price on education is lower than would be efficient from a socio-economic view. By subsidizing and/or finance public or private education the overall national wellfare could in fact increase. \n \n As for the economic implications of a voucher system: This has its positive side, and its negative side. Positive is that you would install some form of competition between schools that gives immediate and visable (sp?) effects. Something that governmental quality controlls and/or media attention fails to accomplish. The only problem is that schools would then have an incentive to steer their educational program towards education that is more and more benfitial for the individual student, but les and less benefitial for the society. This would result in a net loss for the society (assuming that the ratio of individual gain/socieatal (sp?) gain was a good one from the begining).\n \n \n And then we have the political effects, but I won`t get into them at the moment.",

   "Libertarian,\n \n \n \n Excuse my ignorance. How does this change anything? Isn't education still funded by taxes. There will still be the same amount of taxes, the same amount of students, and the same amount of schools.\n\n \n It doesn't change anything. Libertarian is just making XXXX up as he goes along.\n \n The majority of the money funded for public schools come from local taxes (primarily residential property taxes). The second largest funding source is state money known as \"general funds\". The money that goes into general funds come from various funding sources ranging from state income taxes, lottery revenues, and state sales taxes. General fund is a \"virtual pot\" of money. The local governments do not maintain this pot.\n \n States also charge fees for a variety of services and the revenues from those fees go into the general fund -- after paying operating costs for those services. Some fees, though, do not go to general fund and may go to a dedicated \"special funds\" where money from these special funds pay for specific services first before it is used for anything else.\n \n General fund is used to pay for a number of services including education, department of environment, road repair and maintenance, etc. The money from the state for education is primarily depended on school enrollment (fewer students, less money from the state). The notion that the federal government gets a \"percentage\" like a \"middleman\" would is downright bizarre thinking. The same is true for state government's \"percentage\".\n \n And it is a myth that competition via vouchers would improve education. At best, the quality of education won't change. At worse, it will drop. \n \n Contrary to popular attitudes, the United States of America already has private schools. The only thing left to do is for the \"pro-voucher\" crowd to actually acknowledge the significance of this fact -- as in, why are the private schools not competing now? Since obviously, they are not competing with each other now, then they won't be competing with public schools, either.\n \n Secondly, let us pretend that competition actually exists. Let us imagine that this competition that they claim will occur. How will these schools compete? What are they competing for? These schools will be competing for students. That should be obvious. Just like the colleges and universities, the quality of education will drop to attract students to their campuses. Most higher level institutions do not have high entrance standards, not all of them are Harvards and Princetons.\n \n A school cannot get a lot of money -- vouchers -- if the student is unable to enroll in the school due to academic reasons. That is quite obvious. So the private school will have to lower standards to allow them to enroll. \n \n Luckily, private schools don't actually compete so it is unlikely that they would lower their standards, especially since they are plenty of students to go around and not enough schools and teachers.",
