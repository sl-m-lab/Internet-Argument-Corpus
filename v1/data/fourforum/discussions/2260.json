The wide mix of people there would result in it remaining quite seperate and so the conditions persist. Also once a few inventions have been created then it would encourage more later as more expertise becomes more common around the area and communication improves.\n Just a few guesses anyway.\n\n Good post. Technological momentum makes perfect sense--once you get going, one invention may lead to another. As for climate, much of Europe is temperate, but so is North America and South Africa. And temperate climates seem pretty harsh to me, especially in the past. They have serious winters, and wouldn't cold weather be an obstacle? I would think the perfect climate would have weather that never gets in the way, like in Southern California. You talk about land (and presumably crop productivity)too, but wouldn't S. California be really good here too? Why didn't the indigenous tribes in that area invent more? \n \n You might respond that the high movement of lots of people is important along with a favorable climate. Well, Europe is really like a peninsula at the edge of Asia. Your argument tells me the center should be most favorable. China has had crop productivity and large population for a very long time and lots of competetion among different groups (e.g. the incursions of the Mongols), so why not more inventions there? \n \n Africa is where humans started, so for a long time the population center was there giving that region the only chance of advancement, and there are regions with favorable climates there. If a temperate climate was needed, the Southern corner could have worked just like the western edge of Asia (Europe) did. \n \n Competition, climate, centrality, and the movement of people is consistent with achievements of the Mediterranean I suppose, but for one thing competition may be the result of achievements as well as the cause. History is replete with examples of cultures that invent something which gives them greater power which they then use to expand and successfully compete with others over territory, etc. Large populations and movements can also be the result of technological innovation. Mesopotamia developed the plow, much more food was produced supporting many more people, and crowding led to movement. \n \n It seems to me that Mediterranean or China or even Southern Africa may have been the most conducive to scientific achievements based on some or all of the factors you point to, but they did not end up being the center, Europe did.",

You hunt around and can find non-European inventions, but how many European inventions did not make it on the list? The pattern is too striking to explain it away in terms of bias. \n \n \n It is pretty simple to explain it away as biased. When I was talking about \"missed\" inventions, I was not talking little stuff. I was talking tuff like STEEL. That is a pretty severe oversight. The SAIL, another pretty severe oversight. That list pretty much highlights all the MAJOR european inventions, but leaves out some really major ones from other parts of the world. There is no way you are going to convince me that Europe is responsible for 90% of the innovation the world has seen. They spent too long in the dark ages and were not \"civilized\" early enough to get in on any early great inventions. They had their time in the limelight, then were surpassed by America and asia (especially japan).\n \n \nOn your natural resouces point, why was steel first developed in India and Syria, if Europe was the place with the accessible resources? And harvesting hardwoods does not require advanced technologies--is Europe is the only place in the world with abundant hardwoods?\n\n \n In Syria and India, they were panning iron ore out of the streams or collecting it from open cliff faces. The ore deposts in both places are small, and once the exposed deposits ere used required deep mining operations to get to. By contrast, in europe they were mining the stuff in open pits. Deep shaft mining requires a lot higher degree of technology than open pit mining.\n \n At the time, Europe was pretty much the only place in the known world with abundant hardwoods. The middle east was mostly desert, Africa is a somewhat poor place to get hardwoods (though there are some hardwoods that grow in the jungle, they are difficult to harvest due to the complexities of working in the jungle).\n \n \nMy point is that Europe overall has been a hotbed of invention, not just prior to 1800. The sample may have led you to think my focus here is on ancient history--it is not. My sample focused on that early period in response to the claim that Christianity has had less influence in the last couple hundred years. If I had counted all the inventions listed on that website up to the present time, the European dominance would have been only greater. By the way, when I say \"European\" that means America, Canada, Australia, etc. America alone has been a powerhouse of inventions. \n \n \n Prior to 1800, I think the middle east would beat the wetern world as a hotbed of innovation and scientific learning. I think they would spank us pretty badly. The arabs, indians, and even turks, always held a high degree of respect for science and innovation, while the western world ended up in the dark ages burning scholars at the stake.\n \n Since the 1800's the western world has dominated on the scientific front. While the initial cause of this was most likely an abundance of resources, it seems that there is also a cultural bias that should probably be examined in relation to the question. Even today, there are nomadic people in the middle east who travel around on camels, live in tents, and are perfectly happy to do so. I doubt you would find many westerners who would be willing to live like that, much less \"happy to do so\". \n \n The concept of the \"gadget\" is primarily a wesern invention. Little dohickeys that perform no real function but to entertain or make life more comfortable. You didn't see a whole lot by way of innovations related to comfort or entertainment in other parts of the world, that seems to be a primarily western concern\n \n As time goes by, the west will slowly be replaced as the presumptive world power. History shows us this. Soemthign will eventaully happen that the west will be unable to adapt to (energy shortage comes to mind) and anothe region of the world will become prevelant. While I realise it is difficult to envision anything that could weaken the western world in such a manner, I am sure it would have been difficualt for the romans to belive that their empire would ever fall, or for the egyptians to believe they would someday be surpassed.

   "It won't be one hell of an uphill battle to convince me that Europe has not dominated in inventions; when I see compelling evidence that it is not the case, I'll be more than happy to switch opinions. I respect only evidence,and don't give a damn about other considerations. I have to admit I suspect you have some reason why you don't want European dominance to be true. I see that you are not totally inflexible; does that mean you are just mostly inflexible? \n\n \n No, that means I have been interested in, and studied, history for most of my life. In order to convince me that shis is correct, you are oging to have to convince me that most of the histry I have ever learned is wrong. Prior to the Renaissance, western culture was mainly ruled by superstition. \n \n \nI did a mini-study of a sample of inventions. It was simple and quick, but it followed the logic of scientific research. That mini-study was responded to with counter-examples and speculation. The scientific approach requires one to respect systematic data over what has been offered here.\n\n \n No, part of the scientific process is ensuring you have good data to begin with. You picked a fairly random web page, counted inventions, and formed a hypothesis. This is NOT the scientific process.\n \n \nMy original post ask for speculation concerning why we see European dominance. I did not ask for people to speculate about why my mini-study might be flawed. \n \n \n Yes, and I speculate that we see European dominance prior to 1800 because your data set is bad. You asked why I thought the list may be biased, so I told you. \n \n \nYou have shown that the list lacks inventions; you have not demonstrated that it systematically excludes non-European inventions and not European inventions to the extent that only systematic bias is needed to explain my results. \n \n \n If I can list 20 MAJOR inventions of non-european origin that immediatly pop to mind when looking at the list, something is wrong. I am not claiming malice on the part of whoever created the list. I think it is far more likely that it was created by a european who was most familiar with european inventions. If an American made such a list, you would most likely find that it tends to focus on American inventions (unless they hapeed to be a historian, in which case they would be more likely to be aware of other major inventions). THis has a lot more to do with our educational system than intentional bias.\n \n \nOnce again you are missing my point--the issue is not about the list being incomplete or more important inventions being left off; the issue is whether the sample systematically excludes non-European inventions (or more important inventions that are non-European) and not European inventions to the extent that only systematic bias is needed to explain my results. \n \n \n In that case, yes, this particular sample shows the west as a hotbed of innovation. It is still a poor sample and drawing any type of conclusion from such an obviously limited data set would be impossible. So, the answer to the question:\n \n \nCan you explain to me why we see a concentration on inventions in European countries\n\n \n Would have to be:\n \n There is not enough data presented to propose a hypothesis. \n \n \nHmmm, \"Westerners behaved in such a pathetic, stupid manner here\" huh? You are reinforcing my suspicion that YOU have something to prove here. This issue came up in an earlier thread where we were discussing the relative merits and demerits of Christianity. So I got curious about this topic. My point is just what I said: I saw a pattern; how do we explain it?\n\n \n Nope, no paticular bias and nothing to prove. Westerners DID behave in a pathetic and stupid manner. They burned thousands of years of knowledge in the name of superstition. This, to my mind, is pretty stupid. \n \n \nMy point is just what I said: I saw a pattern; how do we explain it?\n\n \n You saw a pattern based on flawed data.

I know that three centers of invention that we have discussed have been Europe, China, and Western Asia. Europe and Western Asia have fairly harsh climates in their own ways, and I think the Chinese were originally a northern people, living in a cold climate. Maybe a fairly harsh climate encourages people to become farsighted, to think, for example, about what can we do now to help ourselves survive the winter? Devoting lots of time and energy to invent things requires an orientation of getting a better pay off down the road even though it may cost you in the short run. \n \n In milder or easy climates, maybe the pressure was off to innovate; maybe the attitude of \"things are good, why change them?\" developed. But in climates that were VERY harsh, like with the Eskimoes, two things may be occurring there. Those climates were simply too harsh to survive in, so cultures that live in those climates now simply haven't had as much time in their particular environment as others. And second, if a climate was TOO severe, all energy would be devoted to mere survival; there would be none left over for tinkering and invention.",

   "Example to bias when it comes to valuing inventions that \"lies close to home\": http://www.nationmaster.com/graph-T/peo_nob_pri_lau_cap\n \n According to this Iceland (1), Sweden (2), Denmark(4) and Norway(5) are among the 5 most succesful when it comes to nobel price winning discoveries per capita. One could make the assumption that Nordic culture and scandinavian socialistic wellfare states would be the most succesful characteristics when it comes to making groundbreaking discoveries during the 20th century. In fact, the correlation is very convincing. However, when you consider the fact that the Nobel price is a price that is awarded in Sweden and that those who choose the winning discoveries are all swedish citizens with swedish bias the correlation becomes slightly less convincing...\n \n Edit: The correlation is still strong if you choose to examine Nobel prize laureates /GDP (Only that Sweden and Iceland switch places and UK beats Norway) : http://www.nationmaster.com/graph-T/peo_nob_pri_lau_gdp\n\n Interesting, but I already believe any list will have bias. The question is whether there is enough systematic bias to nullify the observed pattern. In my sample there were listed close to 300 European inventions. Roughly 10% of the world's population invented 300 inventions. To believe that, in reality, inventions have been evenly distributed among the whole world, you would have to believe that there were no European inventions missing from the list and that 2,700 non-European inventions were omitted from the list (if 10% invented 300, then 90% must invent nine times Europe--that is 2700). Very unlikely.",

Very unlikely.\n\n \n Well, first of all I think the numbers of inventions (or discoveries) throughout the history of mankind has been far more numerous than some mere thousands. Secondly, the list is heavily biased as it is only concerned with the time period since the 1800. Thirdly, even lists of older inventions may stand a risk to be biased as the historic recordings may indeed be biased. And fourthly, I think that recent inventions are more likely to both be listed and differentiated and as europe and the US has been dominant for at least 400 years europe and the US will have disaprotionally many inventions listed in a normal list that doesn`t try to answer your particular question.",

   "Well, first of all I think the numbers of inventions (or discoveries) throughout the history of mankind has been far more numerous than some mere thousands. \n \n My point is about the degree of systematic bias against the non-European. There may be more than 3000 inventions (although your point is speculative) but if there are, it is likely that many European inventions did not make the list.\n \n \n\n Secondly, the list is heavily biased as it is only concerned with the time period since the 1800. \n \n\n Once again your point is speculative; how do we know that many pre-1800 European inventions did not make the list. The fact is that invention were slow in coming for much of human history and have exploded in the last couple hundred years, and most have fallen into the European category.\n \n \n\n Thirdly, even lists of older inventions may stand a risk to be biased as the historic recordings may indeed be biased. \n \n\n Again, speculative.\n \n \n\n And fourthly, I think that recent inventions are more likely to both be listed and differentiated and as europe and the US has been dominant for at least 400 years europe and the US will have disaprotionally many inventions listed in a normal list that doesn`t try to answer your particular question.\n\n My question was European dominance in invention overall--not a specific time period--so the list is relevant to this question. Your points as well as the points of every other skeptical person have amounted to mostly speculation and to anecdote. Any reasonable person will take systematic evidence as being weightier evidence than speculation. When I see a better list of inventions show that Europe has had no more than 10% of the world's inventions, then the evidence will have shifted to support for the no-European dominance hypothesis.",
