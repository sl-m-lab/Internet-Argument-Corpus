   "Some years ago, an English preacher by the name of Smith Wigglesworth remarked, \"If you leave people as you found them, God is not speaking through you. If you are not making people either mad or glad, there is something wrong with your ministry. If there's not a war going on, you're not doing your job.\"\n \n Another commentator, a guy by the name of Arthur Wallis, speaking on the apostolic style of preaching that we see in the Book of Acts, said, \"Such preaching makes indifference to the word of God impossible - it sets the hearers into one of two camps. It's calculated to either produce a revival or a riot.\"\n \n Today, there are dedicated Christ-bashers in these forums. They spend their days denying Jesus Christ, attacking the Bible, and attacking Christ's followers. Worse, there are apathetic \"Christians\" who let them slide and don't confront them and their falsehoods. The Christ-bashers don't want any moral judgments made about sin and lifestyles. Instead of fessing up and repenting, they remain stiff-necked like the Israelites of old. Instead of repenting they feel they have to attack the messenger, and the source of the message - Jesus Christ and the Bible.",

   "The intense flogging and torture is not biblcial.\n\n \n Wrong.\n \n \nTHe trial is not historical.\n\n \n Wrong again.\n \n The Temple Scroll and Crucifixion\n \n The following relates to \"The Temple Scroll\" (11QT - one of the Dead Sea Scrolls found at Qumran). The significance of what was found in this first century scroll confirms that the Jews of Jesus' time recommended and endorsed crucifixion for those whom they believed violated their religious beliefs. This evidence strongly counters the arguments of those who suggest that crucifixion was purely a Roman practice and that Jewish authorities therefore could not have been instrumental in recommending the crucifixion for Jesus.\n \n .....the Temple Scroll is evidence that the Jews practiced crucifixion against their own people during the period of Jesus' lifetime. In particular, column 64 describes in some detail the Essene understanding of Deuteronomy 21:22-23 which says: \n \n \"When someone is convicted of a crime punishable by death and is executed, and you hang him on a tree, fall night upon the tree; you shall bury him that same day, for anyone hung on a tree is under God's curse. You must not defile the land that the Lord your God is giving you for possession.\"\n \n The Essene interpretation of this passage is found in the Damascus Document 64.6-12 \n \n Thus you shall eradicate all evil in your midst, and all the children of Israel shall hear it and fear. If there were to be a spy against his people who betrays his people to a foreign nation or causes evil against his people, you shall crucify him and he will die. On the evidence of two witnesses and on the evidence of three witnesses shall he be executed and they shall crucify him. If there were a man with a sin punishable by death and he escapes amongst the nations and curses his people, the children of Israel, he also you shall crucify and he shall die. Their corpses shall not spend the night on the tree; instead you shall bury them that day because they are cursed by God and man, those crucified; thus you shall not defile the land which I give you.\n \n Perhaps the question has arisen in the reader's mind at this point, \"what does this have to do with Jesus?\" Well, the New Testament bears witness to the fact that Jesus was executed primarily because the Jews were angry at him because of his Sabbath practices. This Qumran text bears witness to the fact that crucifixion was used against those who \"defiled\" the land; and Sabbath breaking was defilement! Such defilers are cursed by God! \n \n While it is clear that the Romans in fact crucified Jesus, that the Jewish leadership participated is also undeniable. Of course the actual order was reserved for the Roman prefect. But Jesus was handed over for execution after the Jews had decided that he must be executed.  \n \n http://www.theology.edu/journal/volume3/crucify.htm",

There are a number of religious sites that disagree.\n \n From http://www.ucc.org/ucnews/mar04/passion.htm\n \n \n \n It is important for Christians (and others) who view this film to read the gospel accounts before and/or after any viewing. The danger is that it will become the Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" of Christ's Passion story. That is, the public may only know the Passion story as it is depicted here-with all of the non-Biblical material assumed to be Biblical or historical, just as many now only know the details of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy through Oliver Stone's fictional film.\n \n\n \n and\n \n http://www.ucc.org/ucnews/mar04/passion.htm\n \n \n\n \n How anyone can say this movie is \"theologically accurate\" is beyond me. They are either ignorant of scripture or never believed it to begin with! Be assured that this movie does NOT depict the gospel accurately according to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John! Events that did take place are omitted, and things that never happened were added. Not only does Mel take lightly the warnings to those who add to or take from the word of God, but so do those who endorse this movie!\n \n",

If you are not making people either mad or glad, there is something wrong with your ministry. If there's not a war going on, you're not doing your job.\"\n \n Another commentator, a guy by the name of Arthur Wallis, speaking on the apostolic style of preaching that we see in the Book of Acts, said, \"Such preaching makes indifference to the word of God impossible - it sets the hearers into one of two camps. It's calculated to either produce a revival or a riot.\"\n \n Today, there are dedicated Christ-bashers in these forums. They spend their days denying Jesus Christ, attacking the Bible, and attacking Christ's followers. Worse, there are apathetic \"Christians\" who let them slide and don't confront them and their falsehoods. The Christ-bashers don't want any moral judgments made about sin and lifestyles. Instead of fessing up and repenting, they remain stiff-necked like the Israelites of old. Instead of repenting they feel they have to attack the messenger, and the source of the message - Jesus Christ and the Bible.\n\n \n \n \n I liken todays evangelical christians to the pharisies of christs day. They are so hidebound to the bible and the law,that they wouldn't know Jesus if he walked to them with a choir of angels in tow.

   "Today, there are dedicated anti-Christs in these forums. They spend their days ing Jesus Christ, distorting the Bible, and attacking Christ's followers. Worse, there are apathetic \"Christians\" who let them slide and don't confront them and their falsehoods. The anti-Christ don't want any moral judgments made about their own sins and lifestyles. Instead of fessing up and repenting, they remain stiff-necked like the Israelites of old. Instead of repenting they feel they have to attack the messenger, and the source of the message - Jesus Christ and the Bible. :p\n\n \n very nicely said.. i agree with you.. i am too one of the Christains attacking falsehoods. many people just want proof and when it is given they dont recieve because like you said they become \" stiff-necked\" that is total rebellion to the truth. and they know it. so all we can do is present our facts and our Truth and if they dont believe it well tough luck for them.. theyll kick themselves in the butt one day",

EZ, your posts are, if nothing else, entertaining. I gotta give you at least that :-)\n \n On a more serious note, and related to your (ahem) \"point\", I suggest that you take inventory as to the present and future economic prospects of your and my country. It don't look good. For example, the American economy is driven by oil, and we import half the oil we consume, which makes us dependant on the whim of foreign suppliers. We purchase that oil with American dollars, and the value of the dollar is in decline with respect to many other currencies. You can thank Bush and Congress for that. We've lost much of our manufactoring capability to foreign sources. That's a given. The Chinese and Japanese are buying dollars in an attempt to prop up its value. Why do you think they're doing that? Because they're good guys? No. They want to protect their export market from a declining dollar, and the question then becomes, at what point do they draw the line? That decision is theirs and not ours. \n \n Are we still a military superpower? Sure. But how long can we maintain that position when our economy continues to transition away from manufacture and toward retail and service? We're still the 800 lb. gorilla, but one can discern serious cracks in the wall. And we must ask what relevance our superpower status has to Joe Sixpak, who lost his job at the steel mill and is now stocking shelves at Wal-Mart. That's his first job. His second job is night cashier at the local ARCO-MiniMart. I grew up in an era when the father would take his son to the factory for a job. Those days are long gone. \n \n I fully expect that none of this will make sense to you, EZ, and that's quite all right. I'm not posting for your benefit.",

I'm not saying easier, but better because I can cast all of my worries,concerns, hurts, hangups, and habits at the foot of the cross. Now, what has God given me? A darling wife, a beautiful daughter, a great apartment, a car that's paid for, a steady, stable job (along with a summer job that I enjoy and pays well), two fine basses that serve me well, and much more.

Just \"poof,\" and there he is?\n\n \n Uh, no - 'Just \"poof,\" and there he is' is your angle on the matter.\n \n A nutshell answer to your question: modern man is the only extant species of a once widespread family, the Hominidae, which split from the ape family some 5 or more million years ago. Numerous fossil hominids are known, but the fragmentary nature of the fossil evidence makes relationships hard to discern. Among the known hominids are several types which are strong contenders as human ancestors, or at least as close relatives of those ancestors. An important observation is the chronology of the fossils: we never find sapiens before erectus, or erectus before habilis, and so on.\n \n Given the very low probability of hominid remains being fossilised in the first place, and then of those fossils coming to light in recent times, the fossil evidence for humans having evolved from pre-human hominids is probably as good as we could reasonably expect. You, of course, will continue to advertise your lack of understanding by calling for the 'missing link' to be produced. This is a figment of creationists' imagination: there is no single, discrete step between modern man and non-man. What we do have are specimens from some 500 000 years ago which combine features of early sapiens and late erectus. These are not 'the missing link', as the term has no meaning; but they are good indicators of transition.\n \n From time to time you ask, amusingly, for something you call 'conclusive DNA evidence' of human ancestry. You do so disingenuously, since you are aware that DNA does not survive in very old fossils; but even with that safety net, you still decline to clarify what, if it existed, you would accept as 'conclusive DNA evidence'. Apparently 98% overlap between human and chimp DNA is not enough to convince you of common ancestry; so what would?",

But this posture is often dogmatic, intolerant, and coercive, for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues, and if one does not embrace it, one may likely face public ridicule, demagogic tactics, and perhaps even legal reprisals. Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant.\"\n\n \n EZ, if you're going to cut&paste, you are obligated to cite your source.",

   "\"HOW TO PREACH THE POLITICALLY-CORRECT WAY\"\n \n First, humor their contentions that there is no absolute truth. If you're presenting them with Biblically based truths about Jesus Christ and the Bible and they say, \"That's your truth,\" be sure to tell them, \"Well of course you're right. I'm sure your pagan beliefs about the Bible are just fine.\" Don't respond to their \"all truths are relative\" argument with, \"Are you absolutely sure of that or just relatively sure?\" \n \n If they object to something the Apostle Paul or someone else in the Bible wrote and say \"I don't believe everything that's written in the Bible,\" don't ask them to document why it's not Biblical or what early manuscripts they've researched in making that determination. Just humor their \"feel good\" politically correct denials and tell them they're doing great in making those kinds of observations.\n \n Avoid preaching doctrines that are offensive to the carnal mind, lest they should say to you, as they did to Christ, \"This is a hard saying, who can hear it?\" \n \n Be careful not to disturb the consciences of your hearers, lest they become alarmed about their souls. Make sure you have been without sin of any kind for at least thirty years and are as squeaky-clean and perfect as Jesus Christ before ever preaching about sins that needs to be repented of. \n \n Address the emotions, and not the consciences, of your hearers.\n \n Be careful not to testify from your own experiences about the power of the Gospel and the Holy Spirit, lest you should produce the conviction upon your hearers hearts and minds that you have experienced something they need.\n \n Denounce sin in general, but make no reference to specific sins that the politically correct mind might deem offensive. \n \n Do not give the impression that God commands your listeners here and now to obey the truth. Do not let them think that you expect them to turn anytime soon from their worldly ways and give their lives to Christ. \n \n Admit, either obviously or casually, that all men have sufficient moral goodness in them to get to heaven - lest sinners should understand that they need a radical change of heart from sin to holiness. Don't let them know that they need to repent and receive the perfect righteousness of Christ - achieved by grace through faith in him (Romans 3; Ephesians 2:8-9) - and be born again, in order to obtain salvation. Always let them think they're good enough on their own to please God and get into heaven. \n \n Do not speak of the spirituality of God's holy law (by which comes the knowledge of sin), lest the sinner should recognize his lost condition.\n \n Make no appeals to the fears of sinners; but leave the impression that they have no reason to fear going to hell if they reject Christ.\n \n Always preach Christ as just an amiable and good-natured religious philosopher (but not the divine God and the only way to the Father), and ignore telling them about those scathing rebukes of sinners and hypocrites that he pronounced, which so often made his hearers tremble. Tell them the first part of the story of how he did not condemn the adulteress, but make sure you don't tell them the other part about, \"Now go, and sin no more.\"\n \n Say so little about hell that people will think it doesn't really exist. Push the politically correct mindset that God would never send anyone to hell. Ignore all the teachings and parables about hell that Christ and others taught.\n \n Make no disagreeable references to the teachings of self- denial, cross-bearing, and crucifixion to the world, lest you should convict and convert people.\n \n Do not rebuke any worldly tendencies you find in society or in the church, lest you should hurt someone's feelings.\n \n Don't explain to them that sanctification by the Holy Spirit is a life-long process. Let them think that once someone has become a Christian they're automatically perfect. That way they can continue their rant that all Christians are hypocrites and say they don't want any part of them or their God. \n \n Encourage current attitudes in pro gay and pro shack-up churches, so that they think they won't need to turn from their sins and false teachings. And even if, in your own mind, you admit that these things are sins, don't ever ask them yourself (personally) to repent or turn from their sinful ways. \n \n Never take a stand against anything that's politically correct lest you become unpopular. \n \n Even though the Bible says \"Love does not rejoice in iniquity,\" and \"Love does a neighbor no harm\" (like enticing others into unbiblical sin), don't dare mention it. Instead, whenever the carnal minded tell you they love their (illicit sexual) partner, tell them that since it's love then it must be okay with God. \n \n Never ask them how many souls they've personally led to Christ or who and for how long they've preached the Gospel to others. Tell them that's just something zealots do. \n \n Tell them it's okay to change Good Friday and Christmas to \"Spring Break\" and the \"Winter Holidays\" so no one will get their politically correct feelings tweaked and be remotely reminded of Jesus Christ. Tell them two hundred years of Godly American traditions such as these were just narrow-minded nonsense to begin with. And make darn sure you don't do anything about this yourself. Just roll over and let some other mother's son take the heat and fight the fight. \n \n Tell them it's always okay to use the term \"Christian fundamentalist\" in a negative way. Don't let them know that liberal fundamentalism, with all its anti-biblical worldliness, is in any way offensive to God or anyone else. And for sure don't remind them that Jesus Christ had his own Biblically-based, fundamental truths that he preached. \n \n Tell them casual gossip and other personal attacks against fundamentalists is okay, since the fundamentalists are obviously screwed up anyway. Never ask them to document their hateful attacks with hard facts or, God forbid, rebuke the gossip. \n \n Tell them voting for the politically correct candidate who, when elected, puts card-carrying ACLU, pro-partial-birth abortion justices on the bench is really good. \n \n And finally, don't let them know that without conviction for their sins, there is no need for a Savior.",
