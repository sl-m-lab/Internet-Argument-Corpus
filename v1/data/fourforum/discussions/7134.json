I am talking about being paid for work. I think that if you put in a day's work you ought to be able to have a safe, realitic place to sleep, food, you know, the necesities - and maybe a pleasure or two (and no I am not talking about plasma TVs - that's luxury). \n \n \nUnfortunatly we live in a country that is going broke,a nd nobody seems inclined to do much about it. The middle class is sinking to the lower class., or skipping that level alltogether and becoming homeless as employers find that hirings former middle management to do menial labor is not a recipe for success. \n\n \n Neither is modeling our labor force like a Mexican maquiladora where you make pennies a day and still don't eat. Treating the American work force like a slave labor force will turn us into thirld world nation just as quickly as not doing something about our economy. \n \n Fixing this will take sacrifice on both ends. If companies want to cut their costs - they need to cut costs to the consumer, too. They can't just slash wages, but not the price of living.\n \n \nYoua re certainly correct that we do not have the climate to support people living in shacks and shanty towns. That does not mean that is not going to happen, or more correctly that it is not already happening. That just means that more people are going to freeze to death in the winter. \n\n \n And you don't care about that and have the nerve to call me arrogant?\n \n \nWealth and a high standard of living are not your birthright as an American. \n\n \n I am not talking about wealth. And by the way, wealth is not your free ride to abuse and expolit everyone else. \n \n \nFor several generations Americans worked hrd bringing money into the country. For the last few generations we have worked hard at spending it. Now, like a little new money brat who just realized their trust fund is NOT in fact bottomless, we are throwing a temper tantrum. It is an unpleasant wakeup call, but at this point there is not other alternative.\n\n \n Maybe that's YOUR story, but I have worked hard all my life, and never more so than when I was poor.\n \n You seem to have very poor regard for anyone who has not suceeded in creating or desired the lifestyle of the upper class.

I think that if you put in a day's work you ought to be able to have a safe, realitic place to sleep, food, you know, the necesities - and maybe a pleasure or two (and no I am not talking about plasma TVs - that's luxury). \n\n \n That would be nice. Unfortunatly, it isn't reality in much of the world, and we are nearing a point where we can no longer afford the luxuries that the rest of the wolrd does not have. It takes money to provide those things. We are running out of money. End of story. You can try as you will, in your usual manner, to twist this into some kind of vicious anti woman or anti poor litany on my behalf, but facts is facts. My personal opinion regarding the poor means nothing. We as a nation are running out of money. \n \n \n \nNeither is modeling our labor force like a Mexican maquiladora where you make pennies a day and still don't eat. Treating the American work force like a slave labor force will turn us into thirld world nation just as quickly as not doing something about our economy. \n \n Fixing this will take sacrifice on both ends. If companies want to cut their costs - they need to cut costs to the consumer, too. They can't just slash wages, but not the price of living.\n\n \n The down side to this is that production costs have to be cut FIRST. Otherwise the company is out of business before they can do anything about consumer pricing. We need a minimum 35% cut in consumer pricing (because the Chinese good generally cost 30% less delivered). Taking into account the fact that we also have to upgrade our infrastructure while still remaining competitive, that equates to a roughly 72% wage cut in order for the US to be able to compete in the international arena again. We essentially have to be able to match the Chinese wage system, and they are currently striving to make their average wage $18k per year.\n \n This could result in a decrease in US pricing, onshore, of roughly 33%, since the delivery (shipping) costs are lower. By cutting our average wage to $18k per year, that would allow us to produce the goods at the Chinese cost...in theory. In reality, we have some other issues, such as the fact that over half of Americans work in unskilled service industry positions, or have skill sets that are not transferable to production work. This will cause our prices to remain higher in the short term.\n \n If you want to see how that equates to savings, wander through your local Wal Mart. The majority of items on Wal Marts shelves are Chinese made. The price that you see there are the best we could really hope for from American manufacturers.\n \n \n \nAnd you don't care about that and have the nerve to call me arrogant?\n\n \n I don't feel sorry for a rabbit that gets eaten by a wolf, either. #### happens. It isn't a perfect world, but every time somebody gets a bug to make a perfect world it seems to end in slaughter. Life is hard.\n \n \n \nI am not talking about wealth. And by the way, wealth is not your free ride to abuse and expolit everyone else. \n\n \n I am not talking about abusing or exploiting anybody. I am talking about natural economic forces at work. Company A produces the same product as Company B at half the price, Company B either has to find a way to lower production costs, or they go out of business. That is just life. The real world.\n \n \nMaybe that's YOUR story, but I have worked hard all my life, and never more so than when I was poor.\n \n You seem to have very poor regard for anyone who has not suceeded in creating or desired the lifestyle of the upper class. You seem to think them all lazy and unskilled and deserving little more than a grass hut. Is the dollar sign the only value measurement you know?\n\n \n \n Were you working 12 hours a day in a steel mill, making just enought to put your wife and 4 kids, 2 of whom worked as well, up in a one bedroom apartment? Thats what they were doing in the 40's and 50's, thats how we built our industrial infrastucture. As time went by, wages rose because working in a steel mill is hard. Eventualyl it became so expensive to get people to work in steel mills that our steel missl started to go under. Today, we do not produce tool steel anywhere in the United States. Tool steel is the foundation of industry. We import it from Idia, and the fact that we have to import it becuase nobody here is willing to make it means that EVERY item made in the US costs just a little more. \n \n We no longer make nuts and bolts in the US,outside of some small outfits that do custom spec runs. Why? BEcause making nuts and bolts was hard, hot, nasty work and there was not enough overhead in it to pay the rediculously high wages that American workers demanded. \n \n The majority of Americans now work in the service sector. The downside to the service sector is that most of it adds no value to the sytem, it is just shuffling money. A social worker does not do anytihng to make America richer, nor does a maid, or a consultant. Evn oru retail sector, primarily pushing foreign made goods now, does not do naything to strenghten our economy. \n \n You can scoff all you want at the attention I pay economic matters. Only a fool fails to recognize that those things you seem to hold so dear vanish without a viable economy to support them. \n \n You fail to recognize that what you see as a living wage would make you wealthy in most of the world, and you have no birthright as an American to be wealthy compared to the rest of the world. If a guy will sweep a floor for $2 per day in Pakistan, and we have to compete with the pakistanis, then american floor sweepers need to be prepared to do it for $2 per day.",

   "Okey, let`s make some things clear here. American wages merely decide the american distribution of resources in the USA. Nothing more, nothing less. This means that lowering the wage for a certain group will merely shift this distribution. To lower the wages across the board will only shift income derived from work, to income derived from transfers and income derived from capital holdings.

Your wage disparity is allready the highest in the western world (japan included) and a measure like this could easily throw the US into a dual economy, something that previously only third world countries have needed to worry about. No doubt it would cause huge social unrest that most probably would force politicians to act. \n \n Is there no other way of improving US international competativity? Yes, there is. Your wages international competativity is determined by your exchange rate. If the US is in such a bad shape that you desperatly need to increase international competativity, you can decrease the living standards across the board by letting the dollar dive. This will quickly restore the competativity of your export industries as well as discourage imports. It will decrease the american living standard across the board as vaccations abroad and imported goods will become dramaticly more expensive. However, you have not shifted your internal distribution of resources. You could naturally mix these two measures, but keep in mind that your society is allready two-tiered and you allready have significant social problems due to income disparity.",

No doubt it would cause huge social unrest that most probably would force politicians to act. \n \n Is there no other way of improving US international competativity? Yes, there is. Your wages international competativity is determined by your exchange rate. If the US is in such a bad shape that you desperatly need to increase international competativity, you can decrease the living standards across the board by letting the dollar dive. This will quickly restore the competativity of your export industries as well as discourage imports. It will decrease the american living standard across the board as vaccations abroad and imported goods will become dramaticly more expensive. However, you have not shifted your internal distribution of resources. You could naturally mix these two measures, but keep in mind that your society is allready two-tiered and you allready have significant social problems due to income disparity.\n\n \n At this point anything the US does to resolve the inflated standard of living issue is going to require an initial period of economic depression, be it forced or voluntary (doubtful). While either of your scenarios and the more attractive combination of the two would provide a capitalized platform with competitive and profitable production, our current circumstances of directing unacceptable and unsustainable resources to military spending at the cost of social improvement using abnormal debt levels would require unwinding the economy for repositioning. I don't see that as a realistic political option until developing nations have increased their standards of living to absorb reasonable amounts of their now surplus (without US consumption) production. Until they accomplish that, they'll continue subsidization of the US economy by facilitating our debt to protect their markets. \n \n Once that point in time approaches, or the US provides a premature withdrawal as the top consumer through inability to print enough money to service debt due to currency devaluation, I see little change in US attitude at leadership or citizenry levels. The average American still believes a standard of living far above a point of global reality and US position of being a debtor nation is their birthright and our political leadership feeds that myth. So we'll continue paying bus drivers teacher salaries, continue paying three times global market value for other skills producing internal transactions and continue filling our growing inner-cities with an ever-increasing bottom tier of trapped society until a seam breaks or we're slowly dumped as a favored customer.",

Where do you think all of the abandoned buildings and crack houses came from? \n Now, consider that Daewoo's friend is taking an unused wharehouse in a blighted neighborhood and coaxing wealthy people to move back into that area. Once the units are occupied, there's a local demand for goods and services that's created and it draws new businesses back into the area.

   "Okey, let`s make some things clear here. American wages merely decide the american distribution of resources in the USA. Nothing more, nothing less. This means that lowering the wage for a certain group will merely shift this distribution. To lower the wages across the board will only shift income derived from work, to income derived from transfers and income derived from capital holdings. Would this really make the US more internationally competative? Possibly. It would at least attract foreign capital and retain domestic capital. The lower costs of hiring would make it possible to hire more people and produce at lower costs (as long as hiring aditional workers creates aditional profits). \n\n \n You are working on the assumption here that capital holidngs will always increase in value. This is unrealistic. In reality, the US is in a bubble economy. Our housing, used car prices, and even our equity markets are built almost entirely on consumer confidence, which will almost certainly tumble as we adjust wage structure to reflect market realities. \n \n I also want to clarify that I am absolutly advocating across the board wage adjustments here, not just adjustments for the lower class or production workers. \n \n \nThis would obviously lead to even more economic inequality in the US society and would indeed be a very high price to pay. Your wage disparity is allready the highest in the western world (japan included) and a measure like this could easily throw the US into a dual economy, something that previously only third world countries have needed to worry about. No doubt it would cause huge social unrest that most probably would force politicians to act. \n\n \n But without such adjustments to our wage structure, our economy will wither and die, which makes everybody poor. This is not a good thing. I do not agree that across the board wage adjustmetn would cause additional economic inequality. Our economic inequality has increased as our economy falters. I see nothing to indicate that we could expect a reversal of this pattern. \n \n \nIs there no other way of improving US international competativity? Yes, there is. Your wages international competativity is determined by your exchange rate. If the US is in such a bad shape that you desperatly need to increase international competativity, you can decrease the living standards across the board by letting the dollar dive.

However, you have not shifted your internal distribution of resources. You could naturally mix these two measures, but keep in mind that your society is allready two-tiered and you allready have significant social problems due to income disparity.\n\n \n \n Considering that over 60% of the world reserve currency is currently held in US dollars, including a large portion of your own countries reserves, do you really want to see this happen? \n \n Additionally, a large portion of our problem is that we do not produce the base materials for the items we do produce. We import things like steel, hardware, machinery, chemicals, etc.. Basically everythign that makes industry roll along. Decrease the value of the dollar, and we STILL have to purchase these things, and do so with a devalued dollar. These costs are passed on to the end user.\n \n Our problem is two fold. First, our people are unwillign to work for a reasonable, internationally competitve wage. Second, our industrial infrastructure has crumbled. We need to both increase industrial capacity and produce our goods at a cost competitve on the international market.\n \n Besides, if you want to talk abotu somthing that would bring a true two tiered society, crashing the dollar in such a manner is gauranteed to do so. While the middle class tends to have only a rudminetary understnading of how our economic system works, and only the most basic understanding of how one goes about protecting themselves from inflation, I assure you that this is well understood by the upper class.",

   "SEC Revamp May Tighten Salary-Disclosure Rules\n December 29, 2005 6:36 a.m.\n The combination of secrecy and massive scale in executive compensation has often proven scandalous. And while the latter is ultimately up to company shareholders, the Securities and Exchange Commission plans to address the former sometime soon.\n \n As early as next month, the SEC is due to issue a proposal for a far-reaching overhaul of the disclosure rules on executive pay, in which public companies could have to provide investors with valuations of the pensions and stock options of senior executives, the Financial Times reports. Current SEC disclosure rules have been criticized by investors and academics for failing to provide shareholders with a full picture of bosses' compensation in a particular fiscal year. SEC Chairman Christopher Cox tells the FT that improved compensation disclosure \"is needed in order to eliminate the surprise of hidden payments owed to senior management. ... Investors have every right to better understand the real costs of complicated compensation and benefits packages.\" In 2004 alone, the median total pay of chief executives increased by 30%, according to a survey of 1,522 chief executives by the Corporate Library, a corporate-governance watchdog.\n \n Under the new SEC rules, valuations of executives' pensions and options could be included in the compensation tables that companies must compile about the pay of their top five executives and place in proxy statements, the FT says. While company proxy-statement summary compensation tables for the top five executives currently include salary, bonus and a dollar value for any restricted stock awarded in the past three fiscal years, the table doesn't value any stock options granted to the executives in the year, or give details of their defined benefit pensions. So the SEC is considering requiring companies to give actuarial valuations of the defined benefit pensions, people familiar with the matter tell the FT. They also say the SEC is considering requiring companies to make fair or market valuations of stock options at the time they are granted to executives, and to include the information in the summary compensation table.\n \n Separately, new rules on how U.S. companies account for stock options are set to cause widespread confusion on Wall Street early next year as investors struggle to make sense of the numbers, and investment analysts tell the FT this will increase the number of investors who simply ignore the new numbers. Some warn it could eventually undermine the effect of the accounting change, which took more than a decade to bring about and forces companies to deduct the cost of employee options from their reported profits. The confusion is likely to hit technology companies hardest, given their extensive use of stock options to reward employees, the FT adds. The predicted confusion stems from a lack of agreement on whether investors should treat option costs in the same way as other corporate expenses, as well as the difficulty many will have in understanding the transitional impact of the new rules. Several big Wall Street banks have issued directives to their analysts requiring them to take option costs into account, but others say they will instead assess companies using \"pro-forma\" numbers that exclude the costs.\n \n By JOSEPH SCHUMAN",

   "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/02/opinion/02mon2.html\n \n January 2, 2006\n Editorial\n Another Marie Antoinette Moment \n There is no shortage of numbers and studies detailing the widening gap between what American companies pay workers and the millions of dollars those same companies pay top executives. But just in case anyone hasn't been paying attention, here enters David Brooks, chief executive of the bulletproof vest manufacturer DHB Industries Inc., to provide a fuller picture. \n \n Mr. Brooks has made hundreds of millions of dollars through the company, principally from federal and municipal contracts for bulletproof vests. But while 18,000 of those vests were being recalled by the United States military, some from Iraq, Mr. Brooks was in the midst of throwing a private party for his daughter and her friends at the Rainbow Room at Rockefeller Center. \n \n The bash was headlined by a list of performers that could easily have carried the Super Bowl halftime extravaganza. The superstar rapper 50 Cent and the front men from the rock group Aerosmith were among the night's many performers. According to The Daily News in New York, the party's estimated $10 million price tag - a figure Mr. Brooks albeit called greatly exaggerated - culminated with guests reportedly walking out carrying gift bags valued at $1,000 each, stocked with digital cameras and video iPods.\n \n Mr. Brooks is free to spend his money as he pleases, but he might have thought better than to draw added attention to his company right now. The November recall of the vests was the second by the military in 2005. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the company and Mr. Brooks. And the company is also the target of several shareholder lawsuits after a material in some of its body armor failed a federal safety test. \n \n Meanwhile, the party came less than three months after the release of a report on ballooning pay for chief executives that singled out Mr. Brooks for making $70 million in 2004 compared with $525,000 in pre-Iraq-war 2001. The report said he made an additional $186 million in 2004 selling company stock.\n \n The same report, by the Institute for Policy Studies, a left-leaning research center, and United for a Fair Economy, a group seeking to narrow the gap between rich and poor, found that in 2004 the ratio of C.E.O. pay to worker pay at large companies had ballooned to 431 to 1. If the minimum wage had advanced at the same rate as chief executive compensation since 1990, America's bottom-of-the-barrel working poor would be enjoying salad days, with legal wages at $23.03 an hour instead of $5.15.\n \n In the go-go days of the Internet bubble, these kinds of statistics were easy to ignore because it felt as if anyone could be the next millionaire and surely the rising tide would lift all boats. Now corporate profits are being wrung in large part from cost cutting like reductions to worker health care and retirement, layoffs and plant closings. \n \n It would be nice to see corporate America put more effort - and money - into quality control and fair living wages for workers and less into exorbitant pay packages and bonuses for corporate chieftains. We remain hopeful, although we can't help but think that while the average American will read about Mr. Brooks's war-windfall party at the Rainbow Room and feel queasy, someone in the ranks of the super-rich might take it as a challenge and check to see if the Taj Mahal is available for birthday parties.",
