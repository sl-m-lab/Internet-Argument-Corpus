What if Dark energy/dark stars like them expanded from the big bang until they reach their apex, then snap back on themselves like a rubber band to the size of a Sun like ours and from the heat, friction and energy release caused by the reversal, so does the Nuclear reaction which ignites the dark matter and creates visible light and a newly born sun. \n \n The Sun is massive from our perspective but compared to the Dark Star it might have been that could have been 200,000 times larger than its current size prior to its birth as the Sun we know it to be today would explain the enormous amount of energy contained within it/them. It would also explain why new Suns are being born all the time even though Time and Space is very old. The question is, why are these dark stars reaching their apexes at such different rates of speed? \n \n Are they expanding at different rates, or is their mass determining the size they expand to before reaching their own unique apex which also determines the size of the Sun they become once they shrink back into the visible light density range allowing for the Nuclear reaction which will feed their new life as a visible energy source for the Solar System they inhabit.\n \n What I like about String Theory and Quantum Physics is that it is all completely theoretical and hypothetical in that it is currently completely unprovable.
