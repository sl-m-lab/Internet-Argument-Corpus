Addiction is a categorized disorder. There are many addictions listed...alcohol among them, but they all point to addictive behavior leading to disorder...as long as they meet the criteria.

Who suggested that you had to be a Christian for the constitution to apply to you?\n \n \n If we deny someone the same opportunities afforded others based on a religious belief that their sexual orientation is not correct, we are denying them their constitutional rights.

Many speculate that Buchanan, from a Quaker anti-slavery section of Pennsylvania, adopted his pro-slavery views from a homosexual relationship with William Rufus King, the Alabaman former Vice President. Not surprisingly, Buchanan is generally regarded as having been our worst president, taking little if any action against the rising impudence of the pro-slavery South.\n \n Politics and sodomy doesn't mix. It's tempting to suppose that Rasputin got his influence over the Romanovs through sodomy (at least of the Tsarina and the Tsarevitch I'm guessing). It is difficult else to explain how this dissolute drunken nobody gained such influence. That he could magically heal the hemophilia of the Tsarevitch hardly seems credible. Then again, prostaglandins are known to on the whole encourage blood clotting, which is why aspirin tends to prevent heart attacks and strokes (aspirin works by blocking prostaglandins). So you see, sodomy, by making the Tsar the laughing stock of the Russian people, is largely responsible for the rise of Communism, just as it was largely responsble for the South being able to strengthen itself prior to the Civil War, making for a much bloodier conflict.",
