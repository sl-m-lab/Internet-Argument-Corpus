What does this have to do with evolution?\n ======================\n If you can accurately define the qualities of your god and how it relates to the known(knowable) universe, then maybe you'd have something there. It is not some conspiracy that god isn't accepted by science. It's also not an \"evil\" thing.\n \n There are an infinite number of reasons for the creation of the universe that have no visible or measureable evidence to support them. A \"god\" or other magnificent \"creator\" is just one of that infinte number. \n \n Expansion theory, on the other hand, isn't something that some other human made up to make money, nor is it something most people think is \"fact\". It's a theory based on all of the evidence we have so far. Read bullet #1 in this FAQ:\n \n An FAQ on cosmology:\n http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmology_faq.html#XIN\n \n Science is open to interpertation and correction...from anyone. Religion is not.

   "No, God does not guide evolution, but it is a plan in His Work.\n\n That's your opinion, of course.\n \nTake a look around at the hundreds and thousands of variations of \"base\" species,\n\n How do you determine a \"base\" species. What is that supposed to mean?\n \nor average increase in human height in the last few centuries.\n\n Not genetic but rather due to better nutrition, reduction of paracites and so on. It is my understanding that average height is decreasing again.\n \nEvolution is all around us, but it does not, however, explain the origins of life nor of the origins of the universe.\n\n Quite correct. But that is because it doesn't try. Evolution deals with changes in populations of living things. A different field of science deals with the origin of life, called abiogenesis. And the origins of the universe are studied by cosmology. The origin of the universe and the origin of life are not part of the theories of evolution.\n \n It really doesn't matter where life came from. You could even postulate a magic being in the sky that poofed the first life into existance. That is irrelevant to evolutionary theory. Evolution deals with the mechanisms of and the reasons for heritable changes in living organisms.\n \nThe question is religious.\n\n Definately not,\n\n Now you are just being silly. Of course it is a religious question. Any consideration of the supernatural is beyond the domain of science. Science is naturalistic. The supernatural is beyond the abilities of scientific inquiry.\n \nwhat about inflationary theory?\n\n Since it doesn't dealy with changes in the heritable characteristics of living things, it is not evolution.\n \nThat is a scientific belief which people immediately make into scientific fact.\n\n You're being silly again. First, it is a scientific theory. I think that you don't know what a scientific theory is. Secondly, it is far from being considered a fact. There are other theories of the origin of the universe that don't include inflation.\n \nThere is zero empirical evidence supporting inflationary theory, or any other such theory describing the creation of the universe.\n\n Wrong. What is observed are the predicted consequences of inflation. I suppose I could get out some of my books on astrophysics and review it all for you, but I think you would learn more if you consulted someone more knowledgable and who is a better writer than I. I recommend The Whole Shebang: A State-of-the-Universe(s) Report by Timothy Ferris. It is several years old now, but it is a great book for learning about cosmology.\n \nInflationary theory is regarded as \"most-likely true\" because it acceptably fits into the belief systems and biases of the experts.\n\n Nonsense. It is regarded as the best explanation that we have that accounts for all of the observations. It has also been predictive, i.e., it has been used to make predictions of other observations that were subsequently observed.\n \nWhich automatically places it a step above the other theories, Creationism being one, because it doesn't clash with what people want to hear.\n\n But a scientist makes his bones by clashing with what people want to hear and being correct. Eventually, if enough supportive evidence is accumulated, then old theories are overthrown. The problem with creationism is that there is no theory and there isn't a single thread of supportive evidence.\n \nIt takes as much faith to believe the universe came into being from nothing, with energy, matter, and time spontaneously generating themselves. As it does to believe that an omnipotent Creator designed and brought the universe into existence for a purpose.\n\n I imagine it would if anyone actually believed that the universie came into existance from nothing. But that isn't a matter of science, is it. Besides, you are the one who claimes that the universe was made from nothing. Although there is some speculation about the origin of the big bang, it is only speculation. We can't actually know that or even gather any information about it at this time. I don't know what caused the big bang. You can claim that your God did it if you want.\n \nScience cannot dis/prove either God or inflationary theory, or any other theory in regards to the creation of the universe because you cannot use the scientific method on it.\n\n Science doesn't prove. Science offers explanations. The concept of God is beyond naturalistic means of science. Therefore, science neither tries to prove nor disprove the existance of such a a being. However, the inflation theory was subjected to the scientific method. Such experiments like COBE and WMAP support the inflation theory.\n \nAnd I know that just because we can't observe it doesn't mean it didn't happen, but then you'd have to say that for both sides of the arguement.\n\n Sure. But you need some evidence before your side becomes anything more than superstition.\n \nSo you can believe that the question of the universe's or of life's origin is purely religious,\n\n That wasn't the question. The question was did God do it? That is a religious question not subject to consideration by science. No claim was made that the origin of the universe is a religious question. Go back and read again. Follow with your finger when you read if it helps.\n \nbut then you have to dump all your (secular) \"scientific\" theories in there aswell.\n\n Yes. Scientific theories don't deal with God.\n \nOr you can leave them both in the scientific theory category, which is what they are - theories, based off of assumptions and extrapolations - neither of which are void of error.\n\n But creation isn't a theory and it's definitely not science. And science isn't based on assumptions and extrapolations. Perhaps you should take a science course. Science is based on observation, hypothesis, prediction, and testing.",
