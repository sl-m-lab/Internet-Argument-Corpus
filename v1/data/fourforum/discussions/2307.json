This is from Matthew: \n \n 10:29 \n Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.\n \n 10:30 \n But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.\n \n 10:31 \n Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.\n \n There are various and many verses dealing with circumcision. It shouldn't be of any kind of stretch for Christians to believe God just watched a bird go belly up -- actually knew in advance -- and land ingloriously in the bushes. Compared to other things asserted in the bible, counting and actually numbering everyone's hairs isn't that hard to believe. \n \n regards",

To think that this earth is all there is to offer is really quite discouraging. \n \n If there is an afterlife and God is a loving God (and there is and He is) then to kill them is merciful rather than to let them move continually away from that which is best for them, namely God.
