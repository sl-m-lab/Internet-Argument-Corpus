   "So my personal stance on Abortion is that it shouldn't be a get out of jail free card. In other words, you made the decision, you had a myriad of protection issues from condoms to spermicide to the morning after pill, had you taken these precautions you wouldn't BE in this predicament.\n \n \n However I do support abortion if it is a matter of rape, or some other sort of violence or other reason leading to the woman becoming pregnant, or if there are serious medical complications that could endanger the woman's life.\n \n Having said that, I find that sex in general is personal responsibility. One must be knowledgeable and show caution even in the heat of the moment which everyone has been there....\n \n I find it particularly disturbing that the abstinence policy that struck sex education and non biased methodical precautionary measures to young adults, has resulted in the highest escalation of teen pregnancy in over a decade....\n \n Knowledge is power, and while parents have a sensitive issue to deal with especially teens having sex, we all know that regardless of warning or caution a young person is bound to do it.\n \n We at least can give them the tools to do so responsibly. That being said, I believe that if you can't have the balls to talk to your kid about the birds and the bee's and would rather let the state raise your child you have no business being a parent...",
