   "CONFIRMATION OF 1453 BC VIA HISTORICAL INTERLOCKING JUBILEE AND SABBATIC CYCLES \n \n Leviticus 25 (excerpts)\n \n And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,\n Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.\n \n Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;\n \n But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.\n \n That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land.\n \n And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.\n \n Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.\n \n And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.\n \n A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you\n \n \n \n Levitical law required the Israelites to refrain from farming the ground and releasing those in servitude to go free every 7th year. This became known as the Sabbatic Year/7-year Sabbatic Cycle.\n \n Although these Cycles could not be fully operational until they entered the promise land/Canaan, their inaugural reckoning was the year of the Exodus. Thus the 50th year/Jubilee would come 50 years after the Exodus, which would be the 10th year (civil) since the entry into Canaan.\n \n 1453 - 40 year Wilderness journey - 10 years in Canaan = 50th year/Jubilee = 1405-1404 BC (inclusive of year 1453).\n \n However, only after Israel enters Canaan does the first Jubilee Cycle begin, hence Cycle No.1 commences 1405-1404 BC. This Cycle No.1 is counted as such because the Leviticus text specifies \"when they come into the land\" (Leviticus 25:2).\n \n The Jubilee/50th year would be celebrated at the end of 7 sets of 7 year Sabbatic Cycles. The silver Jubilee trumpet would sound throughout the land on the Day of Atonement (10th Tishri) and this new year would be observed as the Year of Jubilee.\n \n \nAccording to the \"Jewish Encylopedia\", Vol.10, page 607:\n \n \"The 16th Jubilee occurred in the 18th year of Josiah's reign.\"\n\n \n This historical fact produces the following tabulation:\n \n 16th Jubilee, that is 7 x 7 Sabbatic Cycles = 16 x 49 = 784 years.\n \n 1453 - 40 - 10 = 1405-1404 = date of first Jubilee Cycle.\n \n Josiah's 18th year (621-620 BC) is when the said 16th Jubilee occurred.\n \n The difference between 1405-1404 BC and 621-620 BC = 784 years.\n 784 divided by 49 = 16 with NO REMAINDER.\n \n IMPORTANT: The fiftieth year was the Jubilee year, but the cycle ended at the 49th year. Hence, the 50th year is the Jubilee AND the first year of the NEXT cycle.\n \n source for the above evidence: Dr. Adam Rutherford, \"Pyramidology Book III\" [1966] London, Tinsley Publishing.\n \n 1Kings 6:1\n \n And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.\n \n External synchronisms link Assyrian king Shalmaneser III 6th year to equate with Ahab's 22nd year.\n \n \nhttp://fontes.lstc.edu/~rklein/Documents/Assins.htm\n \n Kurkh Monolith of Shalmaneser III 853 BCE\n \n COS 2, 263-264\n \n I approached the city of Qarqar. I razed, destroyed and burned the city of Qarqar , his royal city. 1,200 chariots, 1,200 cavalry, and 20,000 troops of Hadad-ezer of Damascus; 700 chariots, 700 cavalry, 10,000 troops of Irhuleni, the Hamathite; 2,000 chariots, and 10,000 troops of Ahab, the Israelite; 500 troops of Byblos; 1,000 troops of Egypt; 10 chariots and 10,000 troops of the land of Irqanatu; 200 troops of Matinu-ba'al of the city of Arvad; 200 troops of the land of Usanatu; 30 chariots and X,000 troops of Adon-ba'al of the land of Shianu, 1,000 camels of Gindibu of Arabia; X hundred troops of Ba'asa, the man of Bit ruhubi, the Ammonite--these twelve kings he took as his allies....\n \n I decisively defeated them from the city of Qarqar to the city of Gilzau. I felled with the sword 14,000 troops, their fighting men. Like Adad, I rained down upon them a devastating flood. I spread out their corpses and I filled the plain. I felled with the sword their extensive troops. I made their blood flow in the wadis. The field was too small for laying flat their bodies; the broad countryside had been consumed in burying them. I blocked the Orontes River with their corpses as with a causeway. In the midst of this battle I took away from them chariots, cavalry, and teams of horses.\n\n \n The above source dates the said battle 853 BC. Rutherford also dates the same event to the same year. (Chapter VII, pages 582,583)\n \n The links below date Shalmaneser III reign began in 858 BC, which establishes the above date 853 BC and its battle to have occurred in the 6th year of Shalmaneser III. Rutherford is in perfect agreement with this information. (Chapter VII, pages 582, 583)\n \n \n http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/battle%20of%20Karkar\n \n \nhttp://www.aina.org/aol/kinglist\n \n Shalmaneser III 858 BC - 824 BC 34 years\n\n \n http://www.fact-index.com/k/ki/kings_of_assyria.html\n \n \nRutherford Chronology/Chapter VII, page 599\n \n Jeroboam 938 BC - 916 BC = 22 years.\n \n Nadab 916 BC - 914 BC = 2 years.\n \n Baasha 914 BC - 890 BC = 24 years.\n \n Elah 890 BC - 888 BC = 2 years.\n \n Zimri 888 BC = 7 day reign.\n \n Civil War: Omri v. Tibni 888 BC - 887 BC = 2 years.\n \n Omri 886 BC - 874 BC = 12 years.\n \n Ahab 874 BC - 853 BC when he died in the 22nd year of his reign. (1Kings 16:29)\n\n \n The inscriptions of Shalmaneser III and the Assyrian King List, and the 1954 discovery of the SDAS King List, which is harmonious with Khorsabad King List and Nassouhi King List, all establish 853 BC (beginning Nissan) as the 6th year of Shalmaneser III with the 22nd year of Ahab. (source: Rutherford/Chapter VII, pages 582-587)\n \n \nRutherford/Chapter VII, page 587:\n \n Dr. H.R. Hall (late Head of the Department of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities in the British Museum)\n \n Dr. Hall quote: \n \n \"We know that Ahab was reigning over Israel in 853 BC, and any chronological theorizing as to Old Testament dates which takes no account of this fact is utterly worthless.\" [\"The Ancient History of the Near East\", page 16]\n\n \n I have now externally fixed the death of Ahab and thus also the years of his reign.\n \n This benchmark dating establishes the death of Ahab = 853 BC, which sets his 1st year (sole) to be 874 BC.\n \n This confirms 64 years between Ahab's first year and the death of Solomon in 938 BC which sets his 4th year to be 974 BC.\n \n Thus the \"480th year\" of 1Kings 6:1, that is 479 years and 1 month perfectly establishes that the Bible dates the Exodus in 1453 BC.\n \n The Jubilee and Sabbatic Cycle evidence spectacularly confirms the 1453 dating over a long range of centuries.\n \n This evidence in its totality decimates any dating of the Exodus based on archaeological remains to be the \"error\" (LOL !) of assuming Biblical chronology false.\n \n Assumptions are not evidence but is packaged as such so anti Bible worldviews are preserved under the disguise of objective research supported by perceived educational credentials. \n \n Ray Martinez",
