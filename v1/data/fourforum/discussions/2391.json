   "I am going to take a walk on the commie wild side here and say that I do think it is possible that human beings will someday reach the point where we do not need governments at all. Aside from the occasional deranged crackpot, crime seems to be a product of environment, and I firmly believe that the time may actually come when people are largly content and crime will decline to the point where it is a trivial matter. At that point, we will not need (or want) a government to force us to do things.\n \n For now, I see the governments monopoly of force as a necessary evil. I, too, am a little leary of the government trying to jump in and run all these other programs, as that is not the function of a government, and the government is not well suited to perform in this capacity.\n \n I will say that there are governments in other countries that do seem to be much better suited when i comes to such things. If you look at Sweden, their government seems better organised and equipped to run large social programs. I am not sure if the difference is the basic structure, or if the difference is an organizational one, but they actually do seem to perform fairly well in this capacity (though there do seem to be some disturbing figures coming ut of Sweden lately). Whether socialism is actually working in Sweden may still be debatable, but I think their governments effectiveness at administering it is not.\n \n In America, the government was not meant to have a monopoly on the use of force. That was why the second Ammnedment was written, to ensure that the people would have the ultimate monopoly on the use of force. Unfortunatly, those that aspire to government generally revel in it, and the biggest threat to the power of a government is a populatio that is able to drag the politicians up against the wall and shoot them should it be considered necessary. So over the course of years, we have joined many other nations, both current and historical, whose politicians regularly behave badly and do so without any real fear of consequence. \n \n I think that removing the governments monopoly on the use of force was maybe the most revolutionary concept in the creation of America. IF the governemnt does not hold a monopoly on the use of force, the public opinion means a LOT more than when they do. What we have anymore is a government that is not a slave of its citizens, but instead rules them as a king might. We have two political parties that are so powerful that their hold on the system is almost unbreakable, and who realistically are so close idealistically that we have to inflate minor issues to make them appear to be relevant. \n \n I don't see the monopolization of force as being an absolute requisit to the establishment and maintenance of a government. IT is instead a cop out by lazy peple who are unwilling to act to maintain order. As an example, I offer up the old west in AMerica. I live in kansas, and have a real interest in the histor of this area. Contrary to what one might see on old westerns, the west was not an area of complete lawlessness. In the early history of the west, there were very few lawmen. A town that was large enough might have a town marshall, and there were some federal marshals running around. Many (but by no means all) counties had a sheriff, but most of the counties in kansas are in the area of 800 square miles or more. \n \n When your local law enforcement official ran into something he could not handle, the local citizenry was fully expected to step up and provide the manpower to assist them in keeping order in their community. If you came upon somebody being robbed, or beaten, or raped, you as a citizen were expected to do something about it. From a standpoint of citizen safety, this was not a great plan, it was also not a big issue becasue crime was actualy fairly rare. Between 1840 and 1844, the court in my area did not record hadeling a single felony. THe majority of what does show on the docket for those years were drunk and disorderly type charges. In that 4 year time span, there were 2 rapes reported to law enforcement, 17 thefts and 9 assaults. I live near emporia, and this area was one of the more populated in the state at that time. \n \n I believe that people did not commit as may crimes during that time due to a few different factors. On wa that land was cheap or free, schools were abundant, and jobs were simple to come by. This is not to my mind an environmen that garners criminal activity. The other reason I think that there was so little crime even in the absence of a large police presence was precisely becasue fo the fact that the government did not hold a monopoly on the use of force. You did not only have to worry about being caught by the government, you had to worry about being caught by the entire civilian population as well, as most people considered it their civic duty to help maintain order.\n \n This is a far cry from today. Not three months ago, a woman was raped in plain view on the shoulder of I 35 in wichita during rush hour. Nobody stopped to render aid, and by the time the police arrived the perpetrator as long gone. This is not uncommon by todays standards. I sat in on a rape prevention class a while back, and they told the girls (it was a bunch of college girls) that, in the event you are raped, you should yell \"FIRE\" instead of \"HELP\" becasue people will not respond to cries for help. The instructor (A KBI agent) said that they have found that in many cases, that following crimes where the victim called for help, people in the area who absolutly MUST have been well within hearing range reported that they did not even hear the cries. There is some question as to whether this is because they were lying, or whether our sense of civic duty as actually declined to the point that we have trained ourselves to tune such things out. \n \n In the absence of citizens who actually are willing to take the initiative to safeguard their society, the monopolization of force by the government is an absolute must.",
