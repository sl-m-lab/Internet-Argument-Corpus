The baby isn't more or less precious. Anymore than my kid isn't more or less precious than the next person's.\n \n The difference is where you feel you can demand accountability. I think pro-life people who accept an exception in the case of incest and rape don't view the child as less precious, they simply don't feel the mother has the same accountability as she did not consent to the pregnancy. (Granted, there are misogynistic lifers those who want to hold women as slaves to any and all pregnancies that come along...)\n \n I really don't think the big pro-life vs pro-choice argument is about where life begins or whether or not life is precious.

In more detail I guess you could say \"is it a right or a want and what would be a right and do we have finite rights\". Pesonally, the right to life is kind of the start of every other \"right\" or \"want\" or anything for that matter...so above all you got that one.

   "It's a good summary of Voice of Reason's position, and the pro-life position as a whole. \n \n Amusingly it's the same form of argument that pro-choice people use to justify allowing a mother to choose to have an abortion. Abortions are horrible, as we pro-choicers agree with the pro-lifers. And we agree that there are situations in which the mother must be supported at the great expense of the child, situations where doing otherwise would be worse. \n \n I think it's easy to agree that the best situation is both the mother and child surviving. The next best situation is only the mother surviving. The third best situation is only the child surviving. The fourth best situation is neither the mother nor the child surviving. The fourth best is naturally the worst situation, with the third best being the second worst, and so on. \n \n I suggest that it is obvious and agreed upon that the second worst (third best) situation is permissable only when a woman consents to giving her life for the sake of the child's life, a heroic action.\n \n Likewise I suggest that it is obvious and agreed upon that where a woman can and will choose to carry the child to term, the best situation, is prefered by all. \n \n The argument seems to start when you try to define the second best (third worst) situation in terms of when it should occur rather than in terms of who makes the choice. Pro-lifers argue that only saving a mother's life itself is worth the child's life. Pro-choicers argue that a mother has interests beyond the prolongation of her life which no one else's interests (including the child's right to life) trump. \n \n When the question of saving the life of a suicidal rape victim, through an abortion of her unwanted child, is agreed upon to avert the worst case scenario, then we are dealing with pragmatic issues of better-worse rather than clear-cut issues of right/wrong. \n \n The pro-choice position depends on that pragmatic stance though, because it needs to show that it is better for a woman's right to choice trumps the child's right to life, in order to demonstrate the preferability of the pro-choice position. \n \n In addressing this question the pro-life position admits that, although all life is equally sacred, there are times when we must be pragmatic and do what must be done to prevent worse from happening.\n \n This is why Duo accuses the pro-life position of \"twisted logic\" because he assumes that it follows from couching the question in such pragmatic terms that the answer must automatically be a pro-choice answer (which isn't true because the pro-life position is starting from a different set of values and therefore must necessarily arrive at a different answer consistent with pro-life principles).",

The objection that Duo seems to have with Voice of Reason is that the pragmatism is not applied consistently over similar situations, as seen with the suicidal tendencies argument. Whether both approach the issue similarly is different than the specific objection I have seen Duo give.
