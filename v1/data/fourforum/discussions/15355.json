   "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/22/opinion/22kristof.html\n \nFaith is a huge force in American life, and it&#8217;s common to hear the Bible cited to bolster political and moral positions, especially against same-sex marriage and abortion.

In the Bible, erotic writing is:\n a. Forbidden by Deuteronomy as &#8220;adultery of the heart.&#8221;\n \n b.

   "This quiz, and the answers below, draw from a new book, \"Unprotected Texts: The Bible's Surprising Contradictions about Sex and Desire.\" It's by Jennifer Wright Knust, a Bible scholar at Boston University who is also an ordained American Baptist pastor.\n \n Professor Knust's point is that the Bible's teachings about sexuality are murky and inconsistent and prone to being hijacked by ideologues (this quiz involves some cherry-picking of my own). There's also lots we just don't understand: What exactly is the offense of \"arsenokoitai\" or \"man beds\" that St. Paul proscribes? It is often translated as a reference to homosexuality, but it more plausibly relates to male prostitution or pimping. Ambiguity is everywhere, which is why some of you will surely harrumph at my quiz answers:\n \n 1. A. Abortion is never mentioned as such.\n \n 2. A, B and C. The Bible limits women to one husband, but other than that is all over the map. Mark 10 envisions a lifelong marriage of one man and one woman. But King Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines (I Kings 11:3). And Matthew (Matthew 19:10-12) and St. Paul (I Corinthians 7) both seem to suggest that the ideal approach is to remain celibate and avoid marriage if possible, while focusing on serving God. Jesus (Matthew 19:12) even seems to suggest that men make themselves eunuchs, leading the early church to ban enthusiasts from self-castration.\n \n 3. A and C. As for stoning on a father's doorstep, that is the fate not of lesbians but of non-virgin brides (Deuteronomy 22:13).\n \n 4. B. Read the \"Song of Songs\" and blush. It also serves as a metaphor for divine relations with Israel or with humans.\n \n 5. B and C. Jesus in Mark 10:11-12 condemns divorce generally, but in Matthew 5:32 and 19:9 suggests that a man can divorce his wife if she is guilty of sexual immorality.\n \n 6. A, B and C. We forget that early commentators were very concerned about sex with angels (Genesis 6, interpreted in the Letter of Jude and other places) as an incorrect mixing of two kinds.\n \n 7. C. \"Sodomy\" as a term for gay male sex began to be commonly used only in the 11th century and would have surprised early religious commentators. They attributed Sodom's problems with God to many different causes, including idolatry, threats toward strangers and general lack of compassion for the downtrodden. Ezekiel 16:49 suggests that Sodomites \"had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy.\"\n \n Hmm. \"Did not aid the poor and needy.\" Who knew that that's what the Bible condemns as sodomy? At a time of budget cuts that devastate the poor, isn't that precisely the kind of disgusting immorality that we should all join together in the spirit of the Bible to repudiate?\nHow'd you all do?",

The rest will be there at their appointed times.\n\n \n I wish you would read the Bible before you go off on these total misrepresentations.\n \n I notice you use that key word unrepentant, givng yourself a backdoor, but really are these Christian values? As long as you say your sorry someday, go ahead and do whatever you find entertaining. For example\n \n Hosea 9\n 11Ephraim's(A) glory shall fly away like a bird-\n (B) no birth, no pregnancy, no conception!\n 12(C) Even if they bring up children,\n I will bereave them till none is left.\n \n \n Even(M) though they give birth,\n (N) I will put their beloved children to death.\n \n \n 16Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb.\n \n or\n \n 2 Kings 15:16 (King James Version)\n \n 16Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.\n \n We already discussed Numbers, but how about one more\n \n Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.'\" \n \n \n These they were unwilling to destroy completely, but everything that was despised and weak they totally destroyed.\n \n 10 Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel: 11 \"I regret that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me and has not carried out my instructions.\" Samuel was angry, and he cried out to the LORD all that night. \n \n 34 Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul. 35 Until the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again, though Samuel mourned for him. And the LORD regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel. \n \n These three examples clearly show God not only condones but gets angry when children, infants and the unborn are not killed as God commands. \n \n The last is 1 Samuel 15\n \n So God commands the death of innocents, encourages his people to seek vengence and condones the genocide of the peoples who occupied what would become Israel going so far as to take away Samuel's rule. \n \n Go ahead best shot, swing batter batter.",
