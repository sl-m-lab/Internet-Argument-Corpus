   "I have mentioned before on these very boards the same fact that Crim has mentioned. A program of international testing begun in the early 90's determined that 4th graders in the United States ranked very near the top (about 20 industrialized nations) in their performance in math and science. The testing has been expanded to over 40 nations and still our 4th graders are near the top in the most recent tests.\n \n When it comes to 8th graders we don't do as well. We are just about in the middle. Those numbers have been steady over the last decade.\n \n But when it comes to secondary school graduates, the United States is near the bottom and we have been through all of the tests (18 out of 20 in the early tests and 40 out of 42 in recent tests). We do a bad job of teaching science concepts and produce high school graduates that are scientifically illiterate. Witness anyone who talks about scientific proof or mumbles that evolution hasn't been proven or that it is only a theory.\n \n The result is that only the very top few or our high school graduates can cut the grade in the sciences in our own universities. Many of those do not aspire to be scientists because of personal preference. Another cause is that scientists are held in low esteem by a large segment of our population. Science becomes a profession that is not desirable and not worth the dilligent effort involved.\n \n So Calli quotes Gallup polls and links the site. But when I cite her very own sources, she wants to see the the \"statistic\" on that. I'm wondering how far you read in that Gallup poll, Calli? You must have a subscription since you quoted the numbers from Gallup rather than another site that was quoting some selected set of numbers.\n \nSo doing a detailed study of something requires that one takes a class for it in a university and reads books papers written on it by \"real scientists\"? Wow, I never knew that. Thanx for enlightening me.\n\n You are welcome. The idea that one would learn science from scientists seemed somehow obvious to me. The idea is somehow more complex than I imagined. If I am sick I do not consult my plumber or my mechanic. On the other hand, I don't consult a geologist if my car breaks down. Where else would you learn science but from scientists? How do you propose to learn about biology but from biologists? How else do you propose to learn about science without reading books and papers written by scientists?\n \n So yes indeed. A \"detailed\" study of a topic requires reading some actual significant literature or actually taking a course at some university. I'll give you a hint though. Evolutionary biology classes are upper division - you'll need 18 to 20 semester hours in biology to get in the door. In my day that it also required a course in genetics - which required a course in zoology and a course in botany.\n \n I mean, how can you claim to have done a detailed study if you haven't read anything written by an evolutionary biologist or taken a single course in evolutionary biology? It's a bit like claiming that I have done a detailed study of christianity by reading Stephen King novels.\n \n The problem is that you made up your mind before you knew the facts. You only sought information from sources who would tell you what you wanted to hear. You don't have the knowledge to judge the scientific validity of the information. And yet you claim that you have done a detailed study of the topic with an open mind.\n \n I'll give you a hint. I spent a year, an hour a day, 5 days a week, studying the Bible with a Bible scholar (PhD). We read it cover to cover. That doesn't even begin to touch on my studies in philosophy and theology. To learn about Christianity and the Bible, I went to theologeans an Bible scholars - I didn't consult one plumber or even an evolutionary biologist.\n \n So please. Exactly how did you accomplish your detailed study of evolution without reading a single piece of evolutionary literature or taking a single course in biology? I am baffled.",

   "Thank you Karl\n \n I stand corrected. I said 68% when it was actually 65%.\n \n The numbers don't reflect the attidude of those who responded. Other polls have returned similar numbers but have shown that even the 68% that favor the teaching of creationism did not mean that they wanted it to be taught as science. Even those who preferred that both be taught tended to separate the topics into \"science\" and \"social studies.\" Creationism can be taught in comparative religion classes along with other religious creation myths. It can by taught in classes on mythology along with other religious mythology. That is not a problem. Enough of that 68% agrees with that to make reduce the number of those who feel that creation should be taught as science to a minority.\n \n I guess it should be pointed out that there is a direct correlation between level of education and income. That may be the significant statistic when creationism is considered. Creationists are creationists because they are less educated. They make less money for the same reasons.\n \n I also notice that I failed to address some other of Calli's concerns.\n \n She asked that I define \"educated\": I really didn't think the word needed definition but I'll try. But I find that even dictionary definitions are circular. I think that it would involve study, whether in formal classes or by reading recognized experts in the field. For example, Douglas Futuyma is recognized as an expert in evolutionary biology and I have read the text book that he wrote. Am I educated? More so than before I read his text. I have also read Gould, Dawkins, Mayr, Maynard Smith, Tattersal, Lewin (and in fact, Lubenow), Smith, Jones, Miller, Szathmary, Williams, Gillespie, Stringer, and on and on. All of those are evolutionary biologists. How may have you read? I think that \"educated\" means a concerted effort to study the views of the experts in the field. Gish, Morris (2), Hovind, Ham, Setterfield, Sarfati, Brown, Johnson, Dembski and others are not evolutionary biologists. But I have read them. And I know enough to know that they are wrong. And they are wrong for the very same reason that you are wrong. They knew the conclusions they would reach before the examined the evidence.\n \nYou prove my point exactly. Just because 99% of scientists believe in evolution, why should I? You are right, by catering to evolutionists we are getting behind in our education.\n\n Just because 99% of astrophysicists believe that the earth orbits the sun, why should you? Just because 99% of medical doctors believe that germs cause disease, why should you? Just because 99% of geologists believe that plate subduction causes vulcanism, why should you? (I know I lost you on that one.) Just because 99% of physicists believe that the sun produces energy by nuclear fusion, why should you? And that's why I don't consult my plumber or my mechanic about plantar fasciitis. What do you know that makes you better informed than thousands upon thousands of scientists who have spent decades of study in their subject. But you, who hasn't read a single book or paper have done a \"detailed study\" (of course with an open mind) and concluded that you are right and they are wrong. Moreover, you think that the terminally ignorant should be allowed to vote on science.",

   "Oh yeah. Crim reminds me.\n \n One of the reasons that our high school graduates fare so badly against other industrialized nations is that they are totally ignorant of evolutionary theory, not to mention what science is and how it works. Of the nations that do better than us, none teaches creationism. We do better than Somolia and Croatia, but they don't teach creationism either.\n \n According the the National Academy of Science and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, one of the major reason for our failure to adequately educate our students in the sciences is the activity of fundamentalist, young earth creationists at the grass roots level of the school district or the individual school. Rather than deal with the constant harrassment from uneducated parents, teachers and administration tend to teach science as a pile of disassociated facts, unrelated to each other and without coordinating concepts. Thus, our students do poorly on exams that test knowledge of the major concepts of science. We're not just talking about biology you know - but physics and chemistry and even a basic understanding of what science is (just like you, Calli).\n \n So Calli, if you think that we are falling behind because we teach evolutionary science (which we don't), the that implies that you can present some sort of coherent theory of creationism. Since you did your detailed study, you must understand the \"scientific theory of creation.\" Please present it and an overview of the scientific evidence. Even if evolutionary theory is incorrect, along with astronomy, astrophysics, geology, molecular biology, population genetics, genetics, nuclear physics and on and on, that doesn't support creationism.\n \n Please present a coherent, non-contradictory, scientifically supported theory of creation. You must explain everything that all of the rest of the sciences explain and you must do it in a more logical manner. If you cannot do so, then creationism is nothing more than an unsupported assertion.",

   "I didn't know they were. Please substantiate that with some reliable figures from somewhere. But back to the point I was making. Our students start out near the top among industrialized nations in their knowledge of math and science (4th grade), fall to the middle by 8th grade, and end up at the bottom by 12th grade. One of the most industrialized nations in the world turns out scientific illiterates.\n\n \n \"College graduates: Creationist 25% Theistic evolution 54% Naturalistic Evolution 16.5% \n High School Dropouts: Creationist 65% Theistic evolution 23% Naturalistic Evolution 4.6%\"\n \n \nLet me see if I understand, you claim that our students do poorly at math because we teach evolution? Where did you get that idea? And considering that these tests measure knowledge of the principles of evolution in the science, and our students do poorly, I don't see your point. You are saying that they do poorly in science generally, including evolution, because our schools teach evolution.\n\n \n I didn't say they did poorly at math! You are simply twisting my words. The students are failing because science is a huge part of their education, and they are being taught evolution. If they answer on homework, tests, etc. that God was the reason for anything they get an F.

Our schools have the obligation to teach the most current scientific theories, you know, stuff like the earth orbits the sun. The students have an obligation to learn and understand their understanding of those theories.\n\n \n So basically you are saying that evolution is the one and only true explanation of how we came to be, and that it is okay for the schools to force students to accept this \"fact\". That is why they are failing.\n \n \nI suspect a lie here somewhere. Why would they not answer questions about evolution by using evolutionary concepts?\n\n \n They don't believe in evolution, that's why. If the question says \"what were some of the transitional links between ape and man?\" they write in that there are none and that man did not evolve. F!\n \n \nFor God sake why? \"Please explain the possible mechanisms for the development of ring species such as the herring gull/lesser black-backed gull. POOF! God did it!\"\n\n \n Yep.\n \n \nAnd they should. It seems that they are not too bright.\n\n \n If you mean that they have not been brainwashed by the public school system, then they are definitely not too bright. \n \n \nDon't be silly. You claimed that you had done a detailed study (with an open mind, no less) of evolution. It turns out that you cannot name a single book about evolution that you have read, much less taken an actual course. I don't claim that you need to graduate from college.

I think that you should at least have the integrity to learn the basics before you comment. You haven't done that.

Maybe you just like making yourself feel superior to me...who knows...\n \n \nSo they're failing because they're XXXXXX?\n\n \n They're failing because the public school system is run by XXXXXX.\n \n \nAnyone who does not believe in evolution is on the same level as niggers and Jews.

   "Hey, I haven't been around in a while, but wanted to step in on this one. If a student is taking a science course, biology, anthropology, psychology...or whatever, the point of exams and essays is to show the teacher that you UNDERSTAND what is being taught. So any student who answers an evolution rlated question with God did it...deserves to fail. Calli, you're the one who insists that Creationists are the ones who have looked at and UNDERSTOOD both sides to the issue and have decided Creationism is the right way to go. In that case, whether they believe it or not they should be able to on an exam explain how something came to be according to whatever model you are being taught in the class, and if it is a science class you should answer the question according to the evolutionary model, more than likeley. So if in a biology class you're friends are asked to explain how bipedality came about and they say....God created man that way, then they deserve to fail. Regardless of what they believe, and decent student knows that when you answer questions in a class you answer in context to the class, not some other way, so whether you believe the evolutionary explanation of bipedality or not is beside the point, you should know enough to know that the answer the teacher is looking for has nothing to do with God. There are a lot of things in psychology that I think are worthless, but if I am asked about a theory which I disagree with, I am still going to explain what the theory is and the support which exists for, because I seriously doubt \"It's a bull**** theory which is absolutely worthless.\" Would give me very much credit. Now if they are writing essays on THEIR OWN opinions and beliefs and are not doing well, then and only then is there a possibility that the teacher is being unfair, and even in that case it is quite likely just because your friends are not supporting their positions very well. So while it is possible that your friends are being treated unfairly, I find it highly unlikely. It seems much more likely that your friends just dont have sense enough to stick to the subject at hand and use what they have been taught to answer a question...their own personal belief is irrelevant. Maybe if you tell you friends to add the words \"According to the theory of evolution\" to every question and they will figure it out. \n \n Sarah",

You can read about it the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study site. Notice that this site is maintained by the National Center for Education Statistics or the United States Department of Education. If you actually have the ability to extract information from the site and the ability to understand what you read, you will find that 4th graders rate near the top, 8th graders near the middle, and 8th graders at the bottom.\n \n For example, in 1999 math scores in Singapore, Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Netherlands, Czech Republic, and Austria were significantly higher than those of the U.S. The U.S. ranked 12 out of 26 countries. The U.S. scored 545 as compared to the average score of 529.\n \n I science the U.S. ranked 3rd, behind Korea and Japan.\n \n 8th Graders ranked 28th out of 41 in math and 17 of 41 in science.\n \n Our 12th graders ranked 19 out of 21 in math and 16 out of 21 in general science.

   "A hypothesis is an educated thought.\n\n Much more. A hypothesis displays internal consistency. It is logically formed and must not contain self-contradictory statements. It must have explanatory value. The hypothesis invokes the causes or forces that are at work to produce what is observed to happen. It may not be a mere restatement of the problem. The hypothesis must make an advancement in the state of knowledge - for example, it must explain some observations that other hypotheses have not been able to explain, while at the same time being always consistent with basic laws of science that pertain. And finally, it must be falsifiable - that is it must be vulnerable to being rejected through the use of empirical tests. A hypothesis is predictive and the predictions must be testable.\n \nA theory is an idea that has some evidence to support it.\n\n No. That's the hypothesis. A theory has been tested. That means that from the hypothesis a prediction is made that has the power to falsify the hypothesis. In other words, the prediction must necessarily be true if the hypothesis is correct. Then an experiment is designed and conducted to test the prediction. When the hypothesis has been tested strongly, it is called a theory.\n \n From the evidence a hypothesis is formulated. The hypothesis is a proposed explanation that takes into account all of the observed facts. It is built on previous science, experience and sometimes guess work. Then comes the prediction, followed by the experiment that tests the prediction. If it passes, you may have a theory.\n \nA Law is an idea that has been proved to be true.\n\n Science is always tentative. \n \n A law is a form of scientific statement with special attributes. First, it is a very general statement in the sense that it is applicable over a wide range of time and space; it is a statement that applies over and over, countless times, in countless situations. Second, the statement of the law, once formulated, does not vary with repitition. Third, and most important, the statement enjoys an extremely small probability of being in error because it has been tested in application countless times by innumerable investigators without once having failed its tests.

   "\"Creationists, otoh, do nothing but attack science because they have nothing of substance to defend.\"\n \n This is not the case. Christ is firmly established, as everything He claimed to be. Even though there is hard evidence for Jesus being everything He cliamed to be, this does not impose on faith which is: \"..The substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\" (Hebrews 11:1) I am placing this in the cross fire, because of ill-advised attacks in this thread, but the majority of this can be carried on to,\"Christ: real or fake, Creator or not\". \n \n A piece that I put together by the manifold grace of God:\n \n Jesus of Nazareth is as established as any one else in history, even before this discovery. We have Josephus (historian of the first century) mentioning Jesus,\"...a man named James, the brother of Jesus, who was called the Christ...\". That was from the historical work \"The Antiquities\". That work holds water in the eyes of nearly every scholar (there is no dispute over it). Then we have a piece in \"Testimonium Flavianum\", also by Josephus, that tells us about Jesus. Just to get a little of it down,\"About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call Him a man.... When Pilate, upon hearing Him accused by men of the highest standing among us, had condemned Him to be crucified.... On the third day He appeared to them restored to life....\" Keep in mind that we have found the historical accounts recorded by Josephus to be extremely accurate, and all of his works have gained him a vast amount of credibility. Now let's take a look at Tacitus, one of the most renowned historians of the time. He recorded,\"Nero fasened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had it's origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievious superstitution, thus checked out for the moment, agian broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome.... an arrest was made of all who pleaded guilty... an immense multitude was convicted.\" From Tacitus' reports we find out that: the Christ was crucified under Pontius Pilate, miricles must have had skeptics calling it a \"mischievious superstitution\", that it \"checked out for the moment\" when Christ was crucified but broke back out dispite the persecution the followers were being subjected to (they saw Christ ressurected and that propelled them to follow Him agian), and they could have saved themselves by not pleading guilty but instead (they were so filled with God's power) they took the penalty and would not deny their Master. So even the absolutly anti-Christian sources give us confirmation to Jesus' character. \n Let's see what Plint the Younger says about the Christian faith, as another non-Christian first century source. (he also went into the early second century) \"I asked them if they were Christians, and if they admit it, I repeat the question a second and third time, with warning of the punishment awaiting them. If they persist, I order them to be led away for execution...I am convinced that their stubbornness and unshakable obstinacy ought not to go unpunished.... They also declared that the sum total of their guilt or error amounted to no more than this: they had met regularly before dawn on a fixed day to chant verses alternately amongst themselves in honor of Christ as if to a god...This made me decide it was all the more necessary to extract the truth by torture from two slave-woman, whom they called deaconesses. I found nothing but a degenerate sort of cult carried to extravagant lengths.\" From this obviously non-Christian document from about A.D. 111, we can gather alot of information. We learn how they knew that Christ was God, how thay were so strong in their faith thay were willing to be slaghtered by the bunches (this would not have been the case had not Christ ressurected), and we learn that they were guilty of nothing other than worshiping Christ. \n -In fact Simon Greenleaf, the founder of the Harvard University of Law, was very skeptical of Christs existence, and was seen as a skeptic. When He, however, looked over the evidence, and dissmissed anything that was not concrete, he came to an interesting conclusion. He found that not only was history showing that Jesus was a real figure, but he found that the death and ressurection is as established as any other event in human history, based on the evidence. \n -Scholar's date the texts of the new testament all before 96 A.D.. In fact, scholars (even non-Christian) have brought back some of the Gospels to less than 7 or 8 years after Christ. These accounts would have never made it to us today had they not been accurate, especially given the almost immediate vast production of these accounts. If the Roman's had the ability to prove these events to be false thay would have jumped on the opportunity. \"All scripture is given by inspiration of God...\" 2 Timothy 3:16",

   "This is not the case. Christ is firmly established, as everything He claimed to be\n \n \n Besides being false, this has NOTHING to do with Creationism. Creationism involves the creation story in Genesis, not the life of Jesus.\n \n \nJosephus\n \n \n Josephus did not live at the time of Jesus. The Testimonium Flavianum, which is usually cited by Christian Apologeticists (is that the word?), is controversial. It says that Jesus was the messiah and rose after three days, among other things. We have other reasons to disregard the passage as possibly being altered by Christians later. For one, the Christian writer Origen said that Josephus did not accept Jesus as the Messiah, which contradicts the passage. Josephus was also a Pharisaic Jew, so claiming Jesus as Messiah would have been blasphemy for him.\n \n Tacitus was also not a contemporary of Jesus and was most likely just repeating what Christians at the time believed.\n \n Pliny the Younger was again not a contemporary. He wrote around 100 AD. The Christians he dealt with wouldn't even have known Jesus. Strong convictions can be found in any number of faiths.\n \n \nIn fact, scholars (even non-Christian) have brought back some of the Gospels to less than 7 or 8 years after Christ. \n \n \n I believe the earliest gospel estimation is placed around 50 ad, which is almost 30 years after Jesus died.\n \n \nIf the Roman's had the ability to prove these events to be false thay would have jumped on the opportunity.\n \n \n You ignore the fact that most people didn't friggin care.

   "\"I believe the earliest gospel estimation is placed around 50 ad, which is almost 30 years after Jesus died.\"\n \n Jesus died in 33 A.D., so at your date of 50 A.D. that would put approx. 17 years between Christ and the first account according to your remembrance. No time for the story to become fabricated, seeing as how it would have never been mass produced if the people of the time new it was not reality. The Apostle Peter would not have been heard from agian lest Christ was resurrected with power and majesty, especially after denying his relations with Christ three times just before the crucifiction. And in actuality, my friend, I am showing you that I do in fact have \"substance to defend\", and Christ is directly related to the issue at hand. \n \n The Bible says in regards to God the Father and His Son Jesus:\"through whom He also made the worlds\". The author also notes that Christ,\"upholds all things by the word of His power\". With those truths I hope you can see that Christ is directly involved with any debate about what He CREATED. \n \n The reason Josephus accounted for the resurrection was that it was so established that he saw it foolish to deny it. He was just taking the EVIDENCE for what it was worth, in the same manner that Lee Strobel did. However, even in acknowledging the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, we still must make a personal surrender to His purpose. James chapter 2 states that even the devil believes and trembles....but he sure is not entering the Kingdom.\n \n \"Christians were a small, unsocial cult.\"\n \n Such a small insignifacant \"cult\" that Jesus was crucified only for the fact that He was the Massiah. He was not commiting crimes, Jesus had no problem with paying taxes to the government (Luke 20:25) , was only bringing peace and healings, but thay crucified Him. But it was prophesy, they said God would be treated like unwanted property. \"But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquity\" (Isaiah 53:5) \"After two days he will revive us; On the third day he will raise us up.\" (Hosea 6:2) The Bible fortold exactly what was to happen long before ot ever took place. Not because these men were super human, but because they were given utterance from God Almighty. In fact the prophet Daniel told us the exact date that we would see \"Messiah the Prince\" in Daniel 9:24-26. It is exactly at 32 or 33 A.D., any other date and that prophesy could not have been fulfilled. Agian, the creator deserves say in regards to His creation. Who are we to tell God Almighty what to do, God needs no counselors. With the power of what Christ has given us to substantiate His claims to being Creator, we had better consider His case, if Christ is Lord there is alot at stake.",

   "I'm going to do this one more time in hopes that readers like Debater will actually grasp the meaning. I don't see that it is possible that he didn't see it before.\n \n In northern Europe and Scandanavia, two species of gull overlap in their range, the herring gull and the lesser black-backed gull. (When I say species, I am using the biological species concept [BSC]. Any two reproductively isolated populations are separate species. If they do not interbreed, they are not the same species). The herring gulls range to the west, while the lesser black-backed gulls range to the east.\n \n You can follow the herring gull to the west, to the Shetland Islands, to the Faroe Islands, to southern Greenland, and on to the upper areas of North America. American herring gulls range well down the coast of North America. This contiguous population continues across North America to Alaska. (I have seen them along the coast of Massachusetts, around inland lakes. I have seen them around Lake Erie and around Lake Yellowstone.) Across the Berring Strait, they are known as Vega herring gulls. As you move to the west, as differences in appearance gradually appear, you will encounter Birula's gull, Heuglin's gull, Siberian lesser black-backed gull and finally, the lesser black-backed bull.\n \n So let me review. These gulls are a contiguous and continuously interbreeding population that circles the globe in the northern hemisphere. At no place is there a break in range that isolates one population from another. So the herring gull and the lesser black-backed bull are the extremes of a single population that circles the globe. And yet, they are separate species.\n \n If you have a problem picturing that, imagine a nest robber in North America that reduces the population of herrings gulls to extinction. You now have two populations of gulls that descended from a single population. They are \"cousins\", so to speak, and do not interbreed even though they are remnants of a single wide ranging population. So which is the \"old species?\"\n \n By the way, this is known as a \"ring species\" in biological science. There are two other well known examples; a salamander the rings the central valley of California, and a bird that rings the Tibetan plateau. In each of these we are able to see the formation of new species because of reproductive isolation - in these cases the extremes of a wide ranging population. When the ends meet because they circle the North Pole, the Tibetan plateau, or the California central valley, they are essentially different species (macroevolution). It must be apparent that they descend from a common ancester - and yet they are separate species.",

   " If the Supreme Court changed its mind. How about teaching both in schools? Students could choose which class to attend.\n\n \n The first attempted sentence is a fragment. Perhaps it should read \"What if the Supreme Court changed its mind?\" I will also assume you are talking about the U.S. Supreme Court. Anyway, this is already the case, in many states a class in creationism is a substitute for normal biology. Personally, I don't agree with this. Also, schoolchildren really do not have the education to pick which course they want to take (that's why they're in school). Also, parents may choose to have their children take creationism. With all the information presented thus far, including the income table, is it really right for parents to give their kids a lower chance at success? Sure, there may be a few lucky students who can make 50k a year, but the majority of all creationists don't get far with their life. They may be religiously in-tune, but is that a decision we should let parents make? Besides, extreme creationists either go to religious school or are home-schooled, so this proposed hypothetical situation is unrealistic, useless, and costly to the government why would the Supreme Court do this if it is such a bad solution to a nonexistent problem?\n \n \n It is not just a religious theory!\n\n \n And my father isn't a shepherd!!! Could you provide one institution other than religion that uses this theory, then? Seriously, I believe we are debating the creationism in Genesis, correct? Then you'd better check your fats on that one.\n \n EDIT: I reread, and it seems you are correct. Creationism isn't a theory at all! On one of my most generous days, I might call it a set of poor hypotheses. It really should be classified as a myth\n \n \n Well using the same logic, evolution is an anti-religion theory!\n\n \n While it is true that science and religion are not generally compatible, because science is based on evidence supporting a hypothesis, which will eventually become a theory after significant support, and a law after virtually proven true (but never actually proven), while religion is a series of stories to try to explain the universe in the simplest way possible (god did it). Science is meant to expand and change over time until the theory of everything is reached. Religion assumes they already have that theory (god did it). Evolution is no mo0re anti-religion than science itself, except that the conflict manifests itself here.\n \n \n Evolution is science. Creationism is a religious belief. So the question is- Should our public schools teach science or religion? \n\n \n Science is a set of hypotheses which get more and more accurate over time. Religion is an unchanging \"guess\" at what could have happened. If the U.S. wants to keep up with its overseas competitors scientifically, we must teach the newest science. This is one of the U.S.'s top goals right now.\n \n \n I don't think eveolution, or religion should be taught in school. Either of them. They are two extreme views, that have nothing to do with education. If a teacher has to go over one(just to keep it fair) she would have to go over both. And like gilligan said that is a lot of different religions to go over. \n\n \n Evolution is by no means extreme. The majority of the scientifically literate agree with it. Evolution also has a lot to do with education. It has been supported time and time again, elevating it from a hypothesis to a theory. If you think a theory is not accurate enough, I would ask you to name 3 laws that have to do with biology. Can't do it? I suppose we should get rid of biology then, right? Wrong. Biology saves many lives every day. From the production of insulin to new medicine every day, biology has saved millions worldwide, and the number rises every day. How many lives, and not souls (don't try saying it saves souls, that's not my question) does creationism save?\n \n \n True, but as Lurch corrected me before: It is the theory of evolution. Just as people have their views on this forum, parents have their views out there, and if a parent does not want their kid to learn about evolution because they believe in creationism, I think a parent has that right. I'm not saying parents should have control over the kids life, but when they are children, they should guide them. Some kids go through school, and don't know anything about god, at all. \n\n \n Point 1) parents have that right, see section I of this post\n Point 2) parents should not be given total control over their children's lives, or else they may make a wrong decision and their children will pay the price\n Point 3) who says you need to know about god? There are many atheists in the world, are you trying to persecute them? I think we must practice tolerance.\n \n \n Quote:\n if a parent does not want their kid to learn about evolution because they believe in creationism, I think a parent has that right. \n Parents also have to right to remove thier children from family life classes where they teach about maturation and sex. If a family seriously has a problem with thier child learning about evolution, I'm sure the school would not object to them removing thier child from the class. \n\n \n Public schools are sometimes required to teah evolution, an alternate solution is home school\n \n \n Quote:\n The theory of evolution is by no means an extreme view. It is the prevailing view. More than 99% of biologists accept the theory of evolution as the best explanation for the observations. \n \n \n \"Although most scientists subscribe to the theory of evolution as the best explanation for the origin of human beings, a recent Gallup poll shows that the American public is much more divided in its own beliefs.\"\n \n www.gallup.com\n \n Just because 99% of scientists believe in something does not mean that 99% the general public believes it as well. It is an extreme view...but then so is creationism. (Depending on how you define \"extreme\".)\n \n I thought this was interesting:\n \n \"A 1999 Gallup poll found that 68 percent of Americans favor teaching both creationism and evolution in the public schools. In an early-2000 survey by People for the American Way, half the respondents said that evolution is \"far from being proven scientifically.\"\n \n If America is a democracy, and 68% of people think that we should teach both evolution and creationism in school, then why don't we? (I know you guys think that it's because we aren't as \"enlightened\" about \"biology\" as scientists.)\n \n lurch:\n \n If your remarks are directed at \"young earth\" creationists only, then I guess you can't be criticizing me, huh? \n \n evolutionists:\n \n I'll take all the criticism I can get! \n \n 2 Corinthians 4:8-9 \"We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.\" \n\n \n I honestly doubt whether the public can make an appropriate decision on this one. True, 68% of the population does support creationism, however, we are not in a democracy. We are in a republic. Also, evolution is IMPOSSIBLE to prove scientifically, by the definition of science. See above for more info. Anyway, many studies have shown that as much as 97% of the U.S. population is scientifically illiterate. Anyway, I criticized your points enough, I hope.\n \n \nQuote:\n Gallup found that creationists tended to be less educated, less affluent, less urban. \n \n \n Define \"educated\". \n Quote:\n As I recall, it was about 68% of high school dropouts that were creationists and about 25% of college graduates. \n \n \n I'd like to see the statistic for that.\n Quote:\n It isn't that creationists aren't enlightened about biology, it is that they tend to be less educated. \n \n \n See above.\n Quote:\n You once said that you had done a detailed study of evolution, \"with an open mind.\" You never did tell me at what university. What books and papers written by real scientists did you read - by the way - real scientists don't have ministries. I suspect that you weren't being truthful when you made that claim. \n \n \n So doing a detailed study of something requires that one takes a class for it in a university and reads books papers written on it by \"real scientists\"? Wow, I never knew that. Thanx for enlightening me. \n\n \n Hmmm... educated could mean IQ, or it could mean college/high school, or it could mean any number of things. What's important is that the statistics exist and are accurate. Anyway, I hope you go and make a good use of your new enlightened life. Except that you seem to have been unenlightened, as you continued posting on the creationist side. \n \n \n Quote:\n The majority does not determine reality. Our science education is already behind other countries. Catering to the ignorant isn't going to help us catch up. \n \n \n You prove my point exactly. Just because 99% of scientists believe in evolution, why should I? You are right, by catering to evolutionists we are getting behind in our education. \n\n \n You have argued that creationism is both part of the majority and minority. Please pick one or the other.\n \n \n lurch:\n \n Do you know why the creationist students are failing in our highschools and colleges? Because most of them teach evolution! If you don't believe in evolution (or at least pretend to) you're history! I have heard countless stories of my friends getting F's on everything from homework to tests because they didn't use evolution as the premisis for their answers. They used God. That is why they are failing. Your definition of education is pathetic. If it were true, that would mean people on this site should not be able to debate about anything until they had gone through college.\n \n karl:\n Quote:\n Pity that the self-proclaimed Christians around here cannot show the same courtesy that you bring to the discussion. \n \n \n Now that was a little bit unecessary, wasn't it? How am I not being courteous? I think you should check your definition of courteous before you start insulting people. Thank you for debating with me.\n \n \n\n You seem to have many religious friends. I hope you practice religious tolerance while choosing them. Also, why would creationists take a class on evolution. When they are opposed to it. I'm sorry, but your friends don't sound very smart...at all...and perhaps you would give us your definition of education? Also, your courteousness is very refreshing indeed.\n \n \n Quote:\n I didn't know they were. Please substantiate that with some reliable figures from somewhere. But back to the point I was making. Our students start out near the top among industrialized nations in their knowledge of math and science (4th grade), fall to the middle by 8th grade, and end up at the bottom by 12th grade. One of the most industrialized nations in the world turns out scientific illiterates. \n \n \n \"College graduates: Creationist 25% Theistic evolution 54% Naturalistic Evolution 16.5% \n High School Dropouts: Creationist 65% Theistic evolution 23% Naturalistic Evolution 4.6%\"\n Quote:\n Let me see if I understand, you claim that our students do poorly at math because we teach evolution? Where did you get that idea? And considering that these tests measure knowledge of the principles of evolution in the science, and our students do poorly, I don't see your point. You are saying that they do poorly in science generally, including evolution, because our schools teach evolution. \n \n \n I didn't say they did poorly at math! You are simply twisting my words. The students are failing because science is a huge part of their education, and they are being taught evolution. If they answer on homework, tests, etc. that God was the reason for anything they get an F. (Because in the eyes of the school, they are wrong.)\n Quote:\n Whether you want to believe it or not is irrelevant. Our schools have the obligation to teach the most current scientific theories, you know, stuff like the earth orbits the sun. The students have an obligation to learn and understand their understanding of those theories. \n \n \n So basically you are saying that evolution is the one and only true explanation of how we came to be, and that it is okay for the schools to force students to accept this \"fact\". That is why they are failing.\n Quote:\n I suspect a lie here somewhere. Why would they not answer questions about evolution by using evolutionary concepts? \n \n \n They don't believe in evolution, that's why. If the question says \"what were some of the transitional links between ape and man?\" they write in that there are none and that man did not evolve. F!\n Quote:\n For God sake why? \"Please explain the possible mechanisms for the development of ring species such as the herring gull/lesser black-backed gull. POOF! God did it!\" \n \n \n Yep.\n Quote:\n And they should. It seems that they are not too bright. \n \n \n If you mean that they have not been brainwashed by the public school system, then they are definitely not too bright. \n Quote:\n Don't be silly. You claimed that you had done a detailed study (with an open mind, no less) of evolution. It turns out that you cannot name a single book about evolution that you have read, much less taken an actual course. I don't claim that you need to graduate from college. I do claim that it is stupid and dishonest to claim expertise that you don't have and to claim to oppose what you don't understand. I think that you should at least have the integrity to learn the basics before you comment. You haven't done that. That is true of several topics on which you post. \n \n \n I think it is hilarious that you still think that in order to do a detailed study of evolution, you have to read 10 different books on it and take brainwashing classes from a university. Maybe you just like making yourself feel superior to me...who knows...\n Quote:\n So they're failing because they're XXXXXX? \n \n \n They're failing because the public school system is run by XXXXXX.\n Quote:\n Anyone who does not believe in evolution is on the same level as ******* and Jews. THERE IS NO GOD. WE ALL EVOLVED. Calligirl, you do not know what you are talking about. Crim and Lurch, keep up the good work! \n \n \n Now THERE is an example of an uneducated XXXXX who just likes insulting people without presenting any facts. I actually like being compared to blacks and Jews. They are some of the nicest people I have ever met. \n\n \n Hmmmm..... all you have posted is fairly insignificant. I apologize that your friends apparently are all so religious that they don't care about their grade, but like everyone has said, schools have to teach accurate material, and evolution is accurate, as it has been tested time and time again, while creationism provides n evidence. I also do NOT appreciate your slandering of public school teachers, especially since I had one every year for 12 years of my life. I'd appreciate it if you apologized to all public school staff everywhere and asked for forgiveness. But I do have to agree with you that Hitler 666's comment was inappropriate and deserves retribution.\n \n Quote:\n Or maybe it's because \"God did it\" isn't a reasonable explanation for anything in science. \n \n \n In your opinion maybe.\n Quote:\n They're doing poorly because they AREN'T being taught about science and evolution when they should be. \n \n \n No, they're doing poorly because they ARE being taught evolution and they are being forced to believe it otherwise they flunk. (Which is what is happening most of the time.)\n Quote:\n Yeah, so if on my math test, I put \"The answer is 7 because my god says so\" and the teacher marks it wrong, he's the XXXXX? \n \n \n We're not talking about math. We're talking about science. (Just in case you didn't notice.)\n \n\n Point 1) GOD DID IT IS NEVER SCIENTIFIC. NO OPINIONS INVOLVED\n Point 2) once again I apologize for your friends' grades, but I really think that how creationists do In an evolution class is irrelevant.\n Point 3) thanks for the friendly reminder!\n \n Quote:\n No. By the definition of how science works. \n \n \n Oh, I get it. Science = evolution. Wrong.\n Quote:\n Wrong. The countries which are beating us are teaching evolution without question, while teachers here have to go around it so they don't stir up controversy (especially in the south). \n \n \n Countries are \"beating us\". That sounds like a lie from the evolutionist brainwashers to me.\n Quote:\n If an person has a dominant gene for brown eyes and a recessive gene for blue eyes, what kind of eyes will they have? \"Whatever color eyes God chooses for them. \"Diversity is created in sexual cells with (mitosis, meiosis)? \"Diversity is created by God.\" The normal force is _____? \"The force God makes.\" What process did pagans use to construct Stonehenge? \"God made stonehenge because he is so strong.\" \n \n \n I don't quite understand what you are trying to prove by this... What my point was is that questions about evolution cannot possibly be answered in a way which will not conflict with God and at the same time get creationists an A on a test. \n\n Point 1) see previous section point 1\n Point 2) I believe your argument is a misquotation, which would make it fallacious.\n Point 3) yet again, creationists don't need to be taking an evolution test.\n \n Wow, that made no sense at all. So I should just forget what I believe and write the answer that the teachers want? That's called tacit consent. People like you are the reason why creationists are failing in schools all around America. Maybe you should learn to stick up for what you believe. \n\n How did you not understand her point? It was simple and concise. If you don't want to argue with it, that's ok, but you don't need to lie. Besides, you understood posts far more complicated than this one, stop playing dum.\n \n Quote:\n Suppose that you're asked to explain the theory of evolution on a test and you don't explain it and just talk about creationism. It's like being asked what is the answer to 2+2. You might not want to say that 2+2=4 because it is the answer the teacher wants you to give. You might consider it tacit consent, but if you write 2+2=5 then you're going to fail the question. \n \n \n 2+2 = 4. That has been proven. Evolution, however, is a theory. Students should not have to answer questions using unproven theories. \n\n \n 2 things\n \n 1: 2+2=4 is only true if the addative postulate is true. You must assume that it is true, because it is a postulate. How is this different from evolution? Making a simple nessesary assumption to come up with a reasonable conclusion. Its what creationists do, only more logically.\n 2: theories can not be proven. Scienctific statements in general are unprovable. This is not that different from creationism, but it does have more logic behind it.\n \n \n No I don't believe in democratic classrooms!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n \n But a parent should be able to choose their childs education.\n\n \n See above\n \n \n Let's say the parents wanted to send their child to a public school but they didn't want the evolution class.\n \n The kid could just not attend the evolution classes.\n\n \n See above, again\n \n \n My def of evolution is that man evolved from a piece of star dust.\n \n I do not mean what lurch said.\n\n \n I'll include a full essay on what evolution is in a few days.\n \n \n Evolution is not \n Quote:\n astronomy, astrophysics, nuclear physics, geology, cosmology \n \n \n Although it is \n Quote:\n paleontology, paleoanthropology, or biology.\n \n\n \n If evolution is a piece of stardust turning into humans, then it would be astronomy, astrophysics, nuclear physics, geology and cosmology, as lurch pointed out. Also, I just noticed that creationist posts are generally shorter than evolutionist posts. That's pretty amazing (not really, all their posts are \"god did it\")\n \n \n no.\n \n Go read lurch's post maybe you'll understand.\n\n \n I think I do understand that you have no evidence behind what you say\n \n \n What I mean is that some creationists believe the universe is only a few thousand years old and they ignore science.\n \n That is what is meant by that list of subjects\n\n \n Could you please explain this a bit more?\n \n \n \"Creationists, otoh, do nothing but attack science because they have nothing of substance to defend.\"\n \n This is not the case. Christ is firmly established, as everything He claimed to be. Even though there is hard evidence for Jesus being everything He cliamed to be, this does not impose on faith which is: \"..The substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\" (Hebrews 11:1) I am placing this in the cross fire, because of ill-advised attacks in this thread, but the majority of this can be carried on to,\"Christ: real or fake, Creator or not\". \n \n A piece that I put together by the manifold grace of God:\n \n Jesus of Nazareth is as established as any one else in history, even before this discovery. We have Josephus (historian of the first century) mentioning Jesus,\"...a man named James, the brother of Jesus, who was called the Christ...\". That was from the historical work \"The Antiquities\". That work holds water in the eyes of nearly every scholar (there is no dispute over it). Then we have a piece in \"Testimonium Flavianum\", also by Josephus, that tells us about Jesus. Just to get a little of it down,\"About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call Him a man.... When Pilate, upon hearing Him accused by men of the highest standing among us, had condemned Him to be crucified.... On the third day He appeared to them restored to life....\" Keep in mind that we have found the historical accounts recorded by Josephus to be extremely accurate, and all of his works have gained him a vast amount of credibility. Now let's take a look at Tacitus, one of the most renowned historians of the time. He recorded,\"Nero fasened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had it's origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievious superstitution, thus checked out for the moment, agian broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome.... an arrest was made of all who pleaded guilty... an immense multitude was convicted.\" From Tacitus' reports we find out that: the Christ was crucified under Pontius Pilate, miricles must have had skeptics calling it a \"mischievious superstitution\", that it \"checked out for the moment\" when Christ was crucified but broke back out dispite the persecution the followers were being subjected to (they saw Christ ressurected and that propelled them to follow Him agian), and they could have saved themselves by not pleading guilty but instead (they were so filled with God's power) they took the penalty and would not deny their Master. So even the absolutly anti-Christian sources give us confirmation to Jesus' character. \n Let's see what Plint the Younger says about the Christian faith, as another non-Christian first century source. (he also went into the early second century) \"I asked them if they were Christians, and if they admit it, I repeat the question a second and third time, with warning of the punishment awaiting them. If they persist, I order them to be led away for execution...I am convinced that their stubbornness and unshakable obstinacy ought not to go unpunished.... They also declared that the sum total of their guilt or error amounted to no more than this: they had met regularly before dawn on a fixed day to chant verses alternately amongst themselves in honor of Christ as if to a god...This made me decide it was all the more necessary to extract the truth by torture from two slave-woman, whom they called deaconesses. I found nothing but a degenerate sort of cult carried to extravagant lengths.\" From this obviously non-Christian document from about A.D. 111, we can gather alot of information. We learn how they knew that Christ was God, how thay were so strong in their faith thay were willing to be slaghtered by the bunches (this would not have been the case had not Christ ressurected), and we learn that they were guilty of nothing other than worshiping Christ. \n -In fact Simon Greenleaf, the founder of the Harvard University of Law, was very skeptical of Christs existence, and was seen as a skeptic. When He, however, looked over the evidence, and dissmissed anything that was not concrete, he came to an interesting conclusion. He found that not only was history showing that Jesus was a real figure, but he found that the death and ressurection is as established as any other event in human history, based on the evidence. \n -Scholar's date the texts of the new testament all before 96 A.D.. In fact, scholars (even non-Christian) have brought back some of the Gospels to less than 7 or 8 years after Christ. These accounts would have never made it to us today had they not been accurate, especially given the almost immediate vast production of these accounts. If the Roman's had the ability to prove these events to be false thay would have jumped on the opportunity. \"All scripture is given by inspiration of God...\" 2 Timothy 3:16 \n\n \n Your first line srets the tone for your post. As has been proven time and time again, creationsm is indeed not substanciated.\n \n \n \"I believe the earliest gospel estimation is placed around 50 ad, which is almost 30 years after Jesus died.\"\n \n Jesus died in 33 A.D., so at your date of 50 A.D. that would put approx. 17 years between Christ and the first account according to your remembrance. No time for the story to become fabricated, seeing as how it would have never been mass produced if the people of the time new it was not reality. The Apostle Peter would not have been heard from agian lest Christ was resurrected with power and majesty, especially after denying his relations with Christ three times just before the crucifiction. And in actuality, my friend, I am showing you that I do in fact have \"substance to defend\", and Christ is directly related to the issue at hand. \n \n The Bible says in regards to God the Father and His Son Jesus:\"through whom He also made the worlds\". The author also notes that Christ,\"upholds all things by the word of His power\". With those truths I hope you can see that Christ is directly involved with any debate about what He CREATED. \n \n The reason Josephus accounted for the resurrection was that it was so established that he saw it foolish to deny it. He was just taking the EVIDENCE for what it was worth, in the same manner that Lee Strobel did. However, even in acknowledging the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, we still must make a personal surrender to His purpose. James chapter 2 states that even the devil believes and trembles....but he sure is not entering the Kingdom.\n \n \"Christians were a small, unsocial cult.\"\n \n Such a small insignifacant \"cult\" that Jesus was crucified only for the fact that He was the Massiah. He was not commiting crimes, Jesus had no problem with paying taxes to the government (Luke 20:25) , was only bringing peace and healings, but thay crucified Him. But it was prophesy, they said God would be treated like unwanted property. \"But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquity\" (Isaiah 53:5) \"After two days he will revive us; On the third day he will raise us up.\" (Hosea 6:2) The Bible fortold exactly what was to happen long before ot ever took place. Not because these men were super human, but because they were given utterance from God Almighty. In fact the prophet Daniel told us the exact date that we would see \"Messiah the Prince\" in Daniel 9:24-26. It is exactly at 32 or 33 A.D., any other date and that prophesy could not have been fulfilled. Agian, the creator deserves say in regards to His creation. Who are we to tell God Almighty what to do, God needs no counselors. With the power of what Christ has given us to substantiate His claims to being Creator, we had better consider His case, if Christ is Lord there is alot at stake.\n\n \n Once again your post has little relevance and is insubstanciated.\n \n \n getting back to the topic...\n \n how did a particle of star dust turn into a living organism?\n\n \n You tell me! It's your theory.\n \n \nalright how did evolution start?\n\n \n See above\n \n \n how did life come about?\n\n \n That is irrelevant. All we need to know is that it did\n \n \n well isn't that very important to the theory of evolution?\n \n Creationists have a theory. Evolutionists don't know.\n\n \n First- no, it isn't.\n Second- what theory is that?\n \n \n Ok. How did this little bob of life become a human?\n\n \n See above\n \n \n How does mutation create a higher life form?\n \n I want to get scientific. I have studied all about evolution.\n \n \n BTW are you a Darwin evolutionist?\n\n \n See above, yet again\n \n \n Many, Many tests have be done on creatures and plants and the result is that the only thing that can happen from a mutation is a lower life form. And yes many of the top evolution scientist agree that nothing so far has been shown to become a higher life form.\n\n \n I recall no such test. Please cite your sources.\n \n without abiogenesis proven evolution can not be proven.\n\n \n See above, yet again\n \n \n NO I believe in the big bang.\n \n I believe in what is call progressive creationism.\n \n God created things over time and in many different periods of time.\n\n \n Once again, there is conciderable evidence supporting evolution.\n \n \n an example of mutations is the eyeless cave fish.\n \n mutations have never led to a higher life form.\n\n \n You can not create the general from the specific, only the specific from the general\n \n \n prove it\n \n evolutionist scientists don't have a link\n\n \n It can't be proven because it's a theory. See above.\n \n \nbecause the earth is older than 10,000 years as many creationists think and the 7 day creation doesn't make sense.\n \n All the fossils are x and z but there isn't any y\n\n \n This is due to punctuated equilibrium. It will be explained later.\n \n \n The word for day in the bible just means a period of undefined time.\n \n what I mean by y is that there isn't any fossils to show that z came from x\n\n \n See above.\n \n \n since you follow darwin would it suprise you to learn that darwin's theory is based off the asumption that microbiology doesn't exist and that if microbiology was proven to exist he stated that his theory would be dead\n\n \n Show me\n \n \n Darwin stated it in the \"On The Origin of Species\" it think but I'll look it up.\n \n Why can't a animal evolve? Because the process that supposedly is evolution is DNA genitic failure. Is occurs when an a few acid particles are destroyed or break off the the DNA string. This is called a mutation. And the only thing that can happen when an absence of a DNA particle occurs is a absence of some feature. An creature with an absence of some feature is considered a lower life form again according to definition an absence of a certain feature constitutes a lower life form.\n \n I took a biology course at a local college which had a whole part of the class dedicated to evolution.\n\n \n That's interesting, but I want a direct quote. Anyway, Darwin can be wrong, you know, but his theory can still be accurate.\n \n \n and yes small changes can occur such as the different types of dogs or cats but not large changes such as from a bacteria to a human\n\n \n Let me get this strait: you want to see 1 generation of bacteria produce a living human? You're crazy. Please wait for my essay.\n \n \n May I point out that the acid assertion is directly from the Encyclopedia Brittanica! \n \n you obviously haven't studied animal types. Like Kingdoms and Phylum and the like. I mean a species type!\n\n \n What edition please? And what page and volume? I need to see this. And how can you tell wether or not someone studied classification?\n \n \n yes yes i know\n \n regarding the animal type \"mystic wall\"\n \n an example is the different skin colors in humans we are all homo sapiens but yet a variation.\n\n \n I'm a bit confused by this comment. Please elaborate.\n \n \n May I point out that the homo neadertalus is just a human with bigger bones! That still doesn't prove that humans decended from bacteria.\n\n \n I'm afraid that hypothesis is obsolete. It was disproved quite a while ago.\n \n \n There is two theory's regarding homo neadertalus one is that he is a separte creature now extint. the other is that he was a human with bigger bones. The reason the DNA is different is because is because neadertalus was much bigger, tougher, and coarser.\n\n \n See above\n \n \none) it's not half the distance\n \n two) bigger bones have different DNA for a neadertalus to become a sapien would be a loss not a gain losses are possible gains are not.\n \n fish can loose there eyes in a cave. humans can loose big bones because of a lack of a need for such big bones!\n\n \n You studied lamarkian evolution, not Darwinian evolution, right? That is beoming more and more apparent. I'm afraid your points are inaccurate.\n \n \n the only difference between a human and a Neanderthal is that neanderthals have larger bones.\n \n fish can loose eyes...\n \n humans can loose large bones...\n \n not a increase but a decrease\n \n and the theory of evolution is based off a continual rise\n\n \n Once again you are using lamarkian evolution. See above.\n \n \n Scientists now know that Neaderthal man was not a shuffling brute, but rather a true human who stood upright with the posture gait, and intellect of a person living today. Neanderthal skeletons and tools suggest that Neanderthal were physically superior to humans today, with larger, more powerfull muscles and stronger bones. In addition, the brain of the average Neanderthal was nearly 11% larger than that of modern man. Neanderthal man was also a moral and spiritual being as man, made in the image of God, has always been: he buried his dead and cared for the old and crippled among the living. Evolutionists now admit that Neanderthals were fully human; they are now classified as Homo sapiens neaderthalensis, designating them as a variety of true humans.\n \n \n When credit is due, credit shall be given. This was taken from a biology textbook.\n\n \n See above, this is now obsolete\n \n \n so how does homo Homo sapiens neaderthalensis prove evolution?\n\n \n You can't prove anything scientifically. See above\n \n \n well point out a evolutionary predecessor to man.\n\n \n Neanderthals, for one.\n \n \n habilis has been denouced by many scientists from both view points as a fake.\n \n homo erectus has been proven to be humans with malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies that caused wierd skeletal features since just about every erectus skeleton is slightly different.\n \n australopithecus (whose classification name was Zinjanthropus)was an extinct form of ape and is now reclassified as australopitheuc boisei or an ancient extinct ape\n \n and I need to look up homo archaic\n\n \n Please cite your sources as it is becoming difficult to believe you.\n \n \n Alright I've done a little research\n \n Dr. Marvin Lubenow in his book Bones of Contention points out that according to the fossil record H. erectus, H. haiblis, and H. sapien were contemporaries throughout most of the hominid fossil record.\n \n Sorry about that my information was old.\n\n \n That's what I said above\n \n \n A. africanus was an ape\n \n A. afarensis was an ape\n \n I don't know about the rest (A. anamensis, A. garhi and A. robustus)\n\n \n See above, please cite.\n \n \n No it is not a homeschool book, although some homeschoolers use it.\n \n A Beka Book Biology.\n \n With regards to the other points I'am currently working on it.\n\n \n Now I know you lied. That book is almost exclusively used by homeschoolers.\n \n \n why is it that some of the species overlap wouldn't that be just like what crim said?\n\n \n What do you mean overlap? The species lives independent of the other species, but an live at the same time.\n \n \nChristian schools use it\n \n with regards to the cousins argument if a creature evolves into a new species wouldn't the old species not exist any more?\n\n \n Um... just wait for my essay, ok?\n \n \n \n ok, i replied to every creationist point, now im going somewhere else. expect my essay in several days",

   "The first attempted sentence is a fragment. Perhaps it should read \"What if the Supreme Court changed its mind?\" I will also assume you are talking about the U.S. Supreme Court. Anyway, this is already the case, in many states a class in creationism is a substitute for normal biology. Personally, I don't agree with this. Also, schoolchildren really do not have the education to pick which course they want to take (that's why they're in school). Also, parents may choose to have their children take creationism. With all the information presented thus far, including the income table, is it really right for parents to give their kids a lower chance at success? Sure, there may be a few lucky students who can make 50k a year, but the majority of all creationists don't get far with their life. They may be religiously in-tune, but is that a decision we should let parents make? Besides, extreme creationists either go to religious school or are home-schooled, so this proposed hypothetical situation is unrealistic, useless, and costly to the government why would the Supreme Court do this if it is such a bad solution to a nonexistent problem?\n extreme evolution is as rediculous as extreme creation. It was always there? give me a break! Prove it.\n \n \n \n\n And my father isn't a shepherd!!! Could you provide one institution other than religion that uses this theory, then? Seriously, I believe we are debating the creationism in Genesis, correct? Then you'd better check your fats on that one.\n \nThank you for grouping all religions together into one institution and showing us that they are all fallacious! The fact that there are so many other institutions to pick from like evolution and... and... and... Well I'm sure your monstorous brain will be able to come up with a couple that arent related to creation or evolution.\n\n EDIT: I reread, and it seems you are correct. Creationism isn't a theory at all! On one of my most generous days, I might call it a set of poor hypotheses. It really should be classified as a myth\n \n \n \n While it is true that science and religion are not generally compatible, because science is based on evidence supporting a hypothesis, which will eventually become a theory after significant support, and a law after virtually proven true (but never actually proven), while religion is a series of stories to try to explain the universe in the simplest way possible (god did it). Science is meant to expand and change over time until the theory of everything is reached. Religion assumes they already have that theory (god did it). Evolution is no mo0re anti-religion than science itself, except that the conflict manifests itself here.\n \n \n \n\n So if a story in the bible is proven to be true, like the fact that there is enough water in the ice caps, and the atmosphere to cover the highest mountains, then these \"myths\" would become less rediculous? Or would there be a logical explanation other than a higher life form did it? Mayabe a crazy man built a big boat at the right time and happened to have two of each animal at the time? But that would be crazy talk. Wouldnt it?\n \n\n Science is a set of hypotheses which get more and more accurate over time. Religion is an unchanging \"guess\" at what could have happened. If the U.S. wants to keep up with its overseas competitors scientifically, we must teach the newest science. This is one of the U.S.'s top goals right now.\n \n\n The stories in the bible do get more and more accurate over time. As people search for evidence of these facts, they find it. \n \n \n\n Evolution is by no means extreme. The majority of the scientifically literate agree with it. Evolution also has a lot to do with education. It has been supported time and time again, elevating it from a hypothesis to a theory. If you think a theory is not accurate enough, I would ask you to name 3 laws that have to do with biology. Can't do it? I suppose we should get rid of biology then, right? Wrong. Biology saves many lives every day. From the production of insulin to new medicine every day, biology has saved millions worldwide, and the number rises every day. How many lives, and not souls (don't try saying it saves souls, that's not my question) does creationism save?\n \n If you take miracles for face value, then miracles save millions, but I suppose you would dismiss them as placebos, and disease regression. This is a more scientifically proven approach. And By the way, Im a creationist that believes in evolution. Put that in your pipe and smoke it.\n \n \n\n Point 1) parents have that right, see section I of this post\n Point 2) parents should not be given total control over their children's lives, or else they may make a wrong decision and their children will pay the price\n Point 3) who says you need to know about god? There are many atheists in the world, are you trying to persecute them? I think we must practice tolerance.\nParents dont have total controll over there kids, and you must not have contact with any if you believe this. Also, you ask if creationists are trying to persicute evolutionists? I think some of the bigot like creationists are, and this is wrong, just like I think that evolutionists like yourself, that are supposed to be scientifically minded are completely closed to the possibility that god did design the 12 fermionic particles, and the 12 bosonic particles. As well as the four fundimental forces, and had them interact with each other in a way that created the universe that we are and interact with today. But to think that this is true is pure poppycock. Is'nt it?\n \n \n \n\n Public schools are sometimes required to teah evolution, an alternate solution is home school\n \n \n \n I honestly doubt whether the public can make an appropriate decision on this one. True, 68% of the population does support creationism, however, we are not in a democracy. We are in a republic. Also, evolution is IMPOSSIBLE to prove scientifically, by the definition of science. See above for more info. Anyway, many studies have shown that as much as 97% of the U.S. population is scientifically illiterate. Anyway, I criticized your points enough, I hope.\n \n \n\n 68% of the USA? cause more like 90% of the world believes in a supreme being of some sort, and 99% of civilization in recorded history believes in a supreme being. and just try to gather evedince to the contrary if you dare.Furthermore, I believe that nothing can be proven to be 100% true by definition of scientific process. And I do believe that theus population is ignorant enough to be only 3% literate of the scientific process. lmao\n \n\n Hmmm... educated could mean IQ, or it could mean college/high school, or it could mean any number of things. What's important is that the statistics exist and are accurate. Anyway, I hope you go and make a good use of your new enlightened life. Except that you seem to have been unenlightened, as you continued posting on the creationist side. \n \n\n It seems that you have no idea of what IQ means. Let me enlighten you. IQ means Intelligence Quotent, Intelligence is by definition, how well you pick up on, and retain the logical and obvious. And I've got news for ya buddy, you havent allready stated what hasnt been said to many creationists before, so take your supposed enlightenment, and enlight your house with it. At least it will be of some use there.\n \n \n \n \n\n You seem to have many religious friends. I hope you practice religious tolerance while choosing them. Also, why would creationists take a class on evolution. When they are opposed to it. I'm sorry, but your friends don't sound very smart...at all...and perhaps you would give us your definition of education? Also, your courteousness is very refreshing indeed.\n\n This statement confirms the fact that you do not excercise the scientific process, as it displays your ignorance of a body of evedince that is not proven untrue.[/QUOTE]\n \n \n\n Hmmmm..... all you have posted is fairly insignificant. I apologize that your friends apparently are all so religious that they don't care about their grade, but like everyone has said, schools have to teach accurate material, and evolution is accurate, as it has been tested time and time again, while creationism provides n evidence. I also do NOT appreciate your slandering of public school teachers, especially since I had one every year for 12 years of my life. I'd appreciate it if you apologized to all public school staff everywhere and asked for forgiveness. But I do have to agree with you that Hitler 666's comment was inappropriate and deserves retribution.\n \n Point 1) GOD DID IT IS NEVER SCIENTIFIC. NO OPINIONS INVOLVED\n Point 2) once again I apologize for your friends' grades, but I really think that how creationists do In an evolution class is irrelevant.\n Point 3) thanks for the friendly reminder!\n \n Point 1) see previous section point 1\n Point 2) I believe your argument is a misquotation, which would make it fallacious.\n Point 3) yet again, creationists don't need to be taking an evolution test.\n \n How did you not understand her point? It was simple and concise. If you don't want to argue with it, that's ok, but you don't need to lie. Besides, you understood posts far more complicated than this one, stop playing dum.\n \n \n 2 things\n \n 1: 2+2=4 is only true if the addative postulate is true. You must assume that it is true, because it is a postulate. How is this different from evolution? Making a simple nessesary assumption to come up with a reasonable conclusion. Its what creationists do, only more logically.\n 2: theories can not be proven. Scienctific statements in general are unprovable. This is not that different from creationism, but it does have more logic behind it.\n \n \n \n See above\n \n \n \n See above, again\n \n \n \n I'll include a full essay on what evolution is in a few days.\n \n \n \n If evolution is a piece of stardust turning into humans, then it would be astronomy, astrophysics, nuclear physics, geology and cosmology, as lurch pointed out. Also, I just noticed that creationist posts are generally shorter than evolutionist posts. That's pretty amazing (not really, all their posts are \"god did it\")\n \n \n \n I think I do understand that you have no evidence behind what you say\n \n \n \n Could you please explain this a bit more?\n \n \n \n Your first line srets the tone for your post. As has been proven time and time again, creationsm is indeed not substanciated.\n \n \n \n Once again your post has little relevance and is insubstanciated.\n \n \n \n You tell me! It's your theory.\n \n \n \n See above\n \n \n \n That is irrelevant. All we need to know is that it did\n \n \n \n First- no, it isn't.\n Second- what theory is that?\n \n \n \n See above\n \n \n \n See above, yet again\n \n \n \n I recall no such test. Please cite your sources.\n \n \n See above, yet again\n \n \n \n Once again, there is conciderable evidence supporting evolution.\n \n \n \n You can not create the general from the specific, only the specific from the general\n \n \n \n It can't be proven because it's a theory. See above.\n \n \n \n This is due to punctuated equilibrium. It will be explained later.\n \n \n \n See above.\n \n \n \n Show me\n \n \n \n That's interesting, but I want a direct quote. Anyway, Darwin can be wrong, you know, but his theory can still be accurate.\n \n \n \n Let me get this strait: you want to see 1 generation of bacteria produce a living human? You're crazy. Please wait for my essay.\n \n \n \n What edition please? And what page and volume? I need to see this. And how can you tell wether or not someone studied classification?\n \n \n \n I'm a bit confused by this comment. Please elaborate.\n \n \n \n I'm afraid that hypothesis is obsolete. It was disproved quite a while ago.\n \n \n \n See above\n \n \n \n You studied lamarkian evolution, not Darwinian evolution, right? That is beoming more and more apparent. I'm afraid your points are inaccurate.\n \n \n \n Once again you are using lamarkian evolution. See above.\n \n \n \n See above, this is now obsolete\n \n \n \n You can't prove anything scientifically. See above\n \n \n \n Neanderthals, for one.\n \n \n \n Please cite your sources as it is becoming difficult to believe you.\n \n \n \n That's what I said above\n \n \n \n See above, please cite.\n \n \n \n Now I know you lied. That book is almost exclusively used by homeschoolers.\n \n \n \n What do you mean overlap? The species lives independent of the other species, but an live at the same time.\n \n \n \n Um... just wait for my essay, ok?\n \n \n \n ok, i replied to every creationist point, now im going somewhere else. expect my essay in several days\n\n As for the rest of this, I think that your tired of typing. and by the way, I'm looking forward to your essay on the subject. It should be interesting.",

And if all of the water in the atmosphere came out of suspension, then all of the mountains would be covered, and they did prove that. \n\n \n We could easily begin playing battle of the quotes here, but I did find this one with barely any effort: \nAbout 3,100 cubic miles of water, mostly in the form of water vapor, is in the atmosphere at any one time. If it all fell as precipitation at once, the Earth would be covered with only about 1 inch of water.\nhttp://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/earthhowmuch.html \n \n As far as all the ice goes, I wonder if you're aware that water actually expands when it freezes - meaning that if it unfroze, it would take up less volume than it presently does.\n \n And sure, there's tons and tons of water soaked into the earth and hidden in aquifers. Are you suggesting that water temporarily worked against gravity to come up to flood the earth? If you are introducing this suspension of the laws of physics, then why even try to bother with polar and atmospheric water, when you can just say \"God made the water come out of nowhere, then he took it away!\" Besides, he doesn't sound like an all-powerful God to me if he can't do that kind of thing.",

I'll type slowly this time so that you will be able to keep up. There are between 1.4 and 1.5 billion cubic km of water on earth, according to two different sources.

Im thinkin that you might find the water that you neglected to mention in these places.\nNope. Even if your number is correct (let's just grant that it is), 97% or earth's water is in the oceans. All other sources of water (fresh water in lakes, rivers, ground water, glaciers, ice caps, atmosphere) comprise only about 3% of the water on earth. So that would mean that there is a total of only 1.75 billion cubic km. In other words, all of the water not in the oceans, according to your number, would be only about 50 million cu km.\n \n But any way, I'll give you a better source that includes all of the water on earth and tells how much there is. Maybe you will realize that your assertion about what \"they\" proved is nonsense. Check the The Water Cycle page at the NASA Earth Observatory site. Notice what is said in the introduction:\n \nIn all, the Earth's water content is about 1.39 billion cubic kilometers (331 million cubic miles) and the vast bulk of it, about 96.5%, is in the global oceans. Approximately 1.7% is stored in the polar icecaps, glaciers, and permanent snow, and another 1.7% is stored in groundwater, lakes, rivers, streams, and soil. Finally, a thousandth of 1% exists as water vapor in the Earth's atmosphere.\nBe sure to check out the table - just page down.\n \n The NASA site agrees with the numbers that fishpower gave. 12,900 cu km total water in the atmosphere at any time and that would be enough to cover the surface of the earth to a depth of about 2.5 cm (that's 'about' an inch). In fact, you might read the site that fishpower linked for you. It is probably more in line with your abilities to understand. The is the USGS Water Science for Schools site.\n \n And now would you be nice enough to support your assertion that \"they\" proved that there is enough water to cover the highest mountains? Who proved it? How did they prove it? Where was this information published? I don't think that NASA or the USGS are cracker jack boxes but I gave you some of my sources. Now what is your source.\n \n I suspect that you are just gullible and got duped by some creationist ministry.

If you had read the chart you would have learned that about 1.7% of the total water on earth is in ground water (23,400,000 cu km). That's not much. Of course there is another 16,500 cu km in soil moisture, and 300,000 cu km in ground ice and permafrost. That is a total of 1.723% of the total water on earth, which is about 1,385,984,000 cu km. Before I said between 1.4 billion cu km and 1.5 billion cu km. NASA gives a number just under the 1.4 billion. That is the total water present on earth - all of it. As I pointed out, it would take 4.5 billion cu km of additional water to cover Everest. That is more than 3 times the total amount of water on earth.\n No. I already told you that there is only 23.4 million cu km in the ground water.\n \n I relied on NASA and the USGS for my numbers, as well as a couple of sites from universities. They were all pretty much in the same ball park. So I have furnished numbers from reliable sources while you haven't provided any sources. All you have is you need for there to be enough water so that your mythology can be correct. Since you demand proof of me, it is only reasonable that you offer your \"proof\", or at least a reliable source.\n I already have. You have offered no support for your assertion.\n So what. Is there 4.5 billion cu km contained in those sources? Please show how they are not taken into account. Please show that the source of all of the hydrocarbons was water that once flooded the earth. Please show that during the flood all of the hydrogen and oxygen formed water that flooded the earth. Also please offer an explanation of how Noah et all survived without oxygen. What caused all of that water to break into hydrogen and oxygen?\n \n You know, you make fundamentalist christianity look quite stupid.\n\n So do you believe in God? Or not? And by the way, I'm just grabbin at straws here, so I have no sources. But the final resting place of the ark was discovered, and if you would like to discredit that, then I'm sure you will be able to find many sources to do so. If you want to believe that we are it, and support the ludicrous assumption that there is no life anywhere else in the universe, you may also do that. This is another belief that I have. We are not the only lifeforms in the universe, and I do have credible resources to back that up. As for God, I cant prove that he exists, but I know in my heart that he does, and you will never change that. For all I know, he removed all of the hydrogen, and oxygen from the hydrocarbons, and oxidized material, and combined them to form water just to get rid of all of the vermin on the planet. Or he took all of the water mollecules in the solar system and put them on earth for 40 days and nights. Or mayabe he flattened all of the mountains and valleys out causing the water to cover all of the land. Who knows. Or mayabe the nasa figures that the rest of the sources you mentioned share are by some miracle wrong. That would just be ludicrous though. Wouldnt it? After all, nasa has a pair of xray glasses that lets them see right down to the mantle, and they havent found any water. And by the way.

And every hole that our rig has ever drilled, and every hole that I have ever heard of being drilled even in the middle east has had to cement a surface casing into the ground to seal off the water table so as not to contaminate it with chemicals. so yes there is water anywhere on the planet if you drill deep enough.

   "Now now, lets not be so harsh on canadianman77. I'm sure he can supply us with some evidence of the ark, if we were only to ask nicely. We can then examine the evidence and see if it... excuse the pun... holds water.\n \n So, in the philosophical spirit... canadianman77, would you please provide evidence to back up your claim regarding the ark? I mean it is poor argument to simply say \"X is the case and you will surely show evidence to the contrary so let us let it rest here.\" I think we aught to see your evidence and weigh it carefully against the \"non-ark theory\" that pandion, waxy, and trebor are proposing. I'm sure the truth with set us free :).\n \n As for God, which you brought up, do you believe the ark story was wholly true... literal that is, to the very last word? Or was it generally some sort of allegory? That is, all the facts need not be true, but some general moral story is the true meaning behind it.\n \n If there is some moral of the story, I would like to know what it is, cauze as a philosopher I have difficulty understanding how an omni-benevolent God would allow 99.9% of the people in the world to die!\n \n The Noah story, however, seems to come from the Akkadian religion (from Sumaria who's capital was Babylon)... remember the ancient tribes of Israel came from that region (if you don't believe me you can look at the book of Job. Job came from Ur, one of the major cities in ancient Sumaria). In the oldest recorded religious text, which outdates the bible as it was written in about 2100B.C. Remember... It was a verbal tradition long before it was written in cuniform! Now in this epic text the hero, Gilgamesh, must travel to a man called \"Utanapishtim.\" Turns out Utanapishtim was the survivor of a great flood created by Enlil because humans were too noisy. Utanapishtim was selected to survive and was told by Ea of the plan to flood earth he was ordered to build an... *drum roll* ARK! Which took seven days to complete. In it he put forth \"my family and relatives. I put aboard all of the craftspeople. I put aboard animals of the field, both wild and tame.\"\n \n In this flood mountains were buried and people were killed. Utanapishtim tells of looking out at the still waters, unable to find any land anywhere \"the surface of the sea was as level as a flat roof.\"\n \n Just a coincidence? Oh and the ancient Greeks had a flood myth known as the \"Flood Cycle.\" It was caused by Zeus who was angry at humans for no longer being nice to each other. This came to a head when a man called Lycaon treated Zeus poorly in his human disguise. Zeus enlisted Poseidon to flood the world.\n \n So the flood myth has a rich tradition in that part of the world and points to something other than a \"biblical\" story. Most religious scholars think that there was a massive flood in that religion of the world that got caught up in the religions, however that is just speculation. No one really knows why these three religions (at the time two major and one in-between Major/Minor) have them, but the scholars agree, Noah's story was heavily influenced by the Utanapishtim flood story.",

Did the energy not evolve to a more complex state?\nLet me repeat. Try to follow this time. The word evolution, when used unmodified, is used by scientists to refer to biological evolution. It is irrelevant that the most general meaning of the word means change, and thus can be used to refer to stellar evolution or galactic evolution, or anything else. You specifically used the term evolutionist, so I thought that you understood that you were talking about biological evolution. That is the only context in which the word \"evolutionist\" makes sense. In a biological context the word evolution has a much narrower meaning, quite specific to biology. It does not mean mere change, but specific kinds of changes in living beings. Biological evolution is not the same as and is not related to changes in the universe.\n \n If you want to be understood, then learn what you are talking about, unless you are a creationist and wish to confuse the issues. Thus, if you want to discuss cosmology, then do so. Just stop going out of your way to confuse the issue by implying that cosmology is evolution and cosmologists are evolutionists.\n \n The problem is that you want to argue against the theory of evolution, just like your preacher told you that you should do to be a good little fundy.

I'm not a scientist.\nWhy am I not surprised by that admission.\n \nI, and probably most of the people here, use the word evolution in the layman sense: interchangeably with \"atheist.\" \nThat's not the layman's sense. You are being dishonest. \"evolution\" isn't interchangeable with \"atheist,\" and you know it. You are making the pretense of discussing science, and if you wish to do so then you need to learn the meanings given to the words by scientists. Otherwise you will not be understood, as is clear from what you have said so far. Science, evolutionary biology, cosmology, or any other science isn't atheistic. No science has the tools to arrive at a conclusion as to whether or not your god exists.\n \nIf you would prefer me to say \"atheistic evolutionist\" and \"the origins of life\" I will.\nIf you wish to continue to be misunderstood and for you opinions to be discounted because you have failed to learn the meanings of words in science, what science is and how it works, then feel free. There probably are evolutionists that are atheists, the the two actually don't have any connection. The connection is in your mind because of what seems to be your bizarre faith and your misunderstanding of evolutionary biology. And, of course, evolution isn't directly concerned with the origin of life. Some magical being could have poofed life into existence and evolution would still be observed.\n \n Most people know what I'm talking about either way. Please, lets talk about my arguments, not your grammar.\n\n Were we talking about my grammar? I missed that too. OK. Let's talk about your arguments. Go ahead and present some.\n \nThis is a misstatement. A common creationist objection to evolution is that mutations do not significantly change life over time. (Macro and Micro evolution)\nWell, I didn't make the statement so I can't figure out why you would include it in a response to me. But I'll explain it to you anyway. The point was quite simple but you seem to have missed it.\n \n You stated, \"The meaning of evolution is for any process to change over time.\" Symbiote replied, \"And a creationist is someone who believes nothing changes over time, is that it?\" If you object to evolution and if your definition of evolution is correct, then it seems to me that Symbiote's inference is correct.\n \n More importantly, why are creationist objections to evolution important? Most especially when they are wrong. The effects of mutations are not theoretical and they do change life over time. Are you actually interested in learning about some?\n \n However, your definition of evolution is a straw man. While your Little Golden Dictionary may tell you that the word \"evolution\" means change, it doesn't go far enough. The word has a lot more baggage than that and you risk making yourself look foolish unless you understand the connotations of the word in addition to the denotation. In Victorian England the word \"evolution\" meant more than just change. If someone had meant change, they would have said change. Evolution meant change in a particular direction, many times with the understanding of progress. Charles Darwin actually used a form of the word (evolved) one time in \"On The Origin of Species.\" It is the last word of the text and Darwin intended exactly the Victorian meaning of the word. However, the word \"evolution\" applied to Darwin's theories (there are at least 5 separate theories of evolution in \"Origin\", not to mention other theories of evolution in other books) soon became popular, and was even commonly used by Darwin's fellow scientists. But Darwin objected to the application of the word to his theories specifically because he intended no implication of direction or progress, and in fact, asserted that there was none. But in spite of his objections, and at the urging primarily of T.H. Huxley, even Darwin finally accepted the name \"evolution\" as the name of the process explained by his theories.\n \n After some decades of debate and objections to evolutionary theory because of the lack of an adequate theory that explained the transmission of characteristics from one generation to the next, Mendel's work was rediscovered. Several biologists, over the course of a decade or more, synthesized Darwinism with Mendelian genetics. Modern biology is built on this synthesis. Interestingly, one major contributor the the synthetic theory was Sir Julian Huxley, the grandson of T.H. Huxley. Out of this synthesis of evolutionary biology also came the definition of evolution that is still used today. I'll give you two paraphrases of that definition, one that I learned when I first began to study evolutionary biology, and another stated in a way that a layman should be able to understand.\n \n Evolution is a change in the frequency of alleles in a population over time.\n \n Quite simple and stated in terms that are understood by every biologist (well, English speaking at least). Now for the layman:\n \n Evolution is a change in the genetic makeup, i.e., the heritable characteristics contained in the genome, either an increase or a decrease, of a group of interbreeding organisms from one generation to the next.\n \n I like the first. It is concise and clear. It may be because I understand the meanings of all the words and because I have an emotional attachment to a definition that I learned the first day of a class in evolutionary biology.\n \n So you accused me of snapping my mind shut because you doubted that I had read your assertion filled and fact-less posts. So demonstrate your open mind by indicating that you have actually read my post, wherein the biological definition of evolution was actually offered.\n \n Thanks for your attention.",

The medical instructions given by Moses to the Israelites some 3500 years ago were not only far superior to the practices of contemporary cultures, they also exceeded medical standards practiced as recently as 100 years ago. Where did Moses get this advanced information? Following are some examples of the medical knowledge afforded the Israelites in biblical times:\n \n Sanitary Practices\n \n For centuries doctors denied the possibility that disease could be transmitted by invisible agents. However, in the late 19th century Louis Pasteur demonstrated in his Germ Theory of Disease that most infectious diseases were caused by microorganisms originating from outside the body. This new understanding of germs and their means of transmission led to improved sanitary standards that resulted in an enormous drop in the mortality rate. Yet these core principles of sanitation were being practiced by the Israelites thousands of years earlier. \n \n The Israelites were instructed to wash themselves and their clothes in running water if they had a bodily discharge, if they came in contact with another person's discharge, or if they had touched a dead human or animal carcass. They were also instructed to wash any uncovered vessels that were in the vicinity of a dead body, and if a dead carcass touched a vessel it was to be destroyed. Items recovered during war were also to be purified through either fire or running water. In addition, the Israelites were instructed to bury their human waste outside of camp, and to burn the waste of their animals (See Numbers 19, Leviticus 11 and 15, Deuteronomy 23:12). \n \n These sanitary practices without question saved countless lives in the Israelite camps by protecting them against infection caused by unseen germs.\n \n Meanwhile, their Egyptian peers were dying by the thousands due to \"remedies\" that almost always consisted of some amount of human or animal dung. As mentioned earlier, the sound sanitary practices that we take for granted today only began to flourish about a 100 years ago. \n\n \n Just think about it. This is not the only one. If you read through my link you will see examples such as:\n \n An advanced disenfectant solution.\n \n The knowledge of Germs.\n \n Laws of quarantine.\n \n Healthy dietary guidelines.\n \n Blood as the force of life\n \n the optimal time for surgery.\n \n and others.\n \n AGAIN: How do you explain this without God?\n \n I'm not done: The bible also has been proven the aboslute MOST ACCURATE ANCIENT HISTORICAL BOOK by tens of thousands of archeological finds. Here are the links I presented:\n \n http://www.bibleevidences.com/archeology.htm\n http://www.myfortress.org/archaeology.html\n http://www.carm.org/evidence/eviden...haeological.htm\n http://www.biblestudymanuals.net/quran7.htm\n http://faithfacts.gospelcom.net/maps_a.html\n http://vvv.com/~csnobelen/jericho.html\n http://www.irr.org/mit/bibarch1.html\n http://www.ucgstp.org/lit/booklets/true/archaeol.html\n http://isaalmasih.net/archaeology-isa/\n \n Again, if you don't want to read the links, at least let this sink in:\n \n Archeological Evidence\n \nIt would be extremely difficult for the honest skeptic to dispute the overwhelming archeological support for the historical accuracy of both the Old and New Testaments. Numerous items discussed in the Bible such as nations, important people, customary practices, etc. have been verified by archeological evidence. Bible critics have often been embarrassed by discoveries that collaborated Bible accounts they had previously deemed to be myth, such as the existence of the Hittites, King David, and Pontius Pilate, just to name a few. The noted Jewish archeologist Nelson Glueck summed it up very well:\n \n \"It may be stated categorically that no archeological discovery has ever controverted a single biblical reference. Scores of archeological findings have been made which confirm in clear outline or in exact detail historical statements in the Bible.\"\n \n When compared against secular accounts of history, the Bible always demonstrates amazing superiority. The noted biblical scholar R.D. Wilson, who was fluent in 45 ancient languages and dialects, meticulously analyzed 29 kings from 10 different nations, each of which had corroborating archeological artifacts. Each king was mentioned in the Bible as well as documented by secular historians, thus offering a means of comparison. Wilson showed that the names as recorded in the Bible matched the artifacts perfectly, down to the last jot and tittle! The Bible was also completely accurate in its chronological order of the kings. On the other hand, Wilson showed that the secular accounts were often inaccurate and unreliable. Famous historians such as the Librarian of Alexandria, Ptolemy, and Herodotus failed to document the names correctly, almost always misspelling their names. In many cases the names were barely recognizable when compared to its respective artifact or monument, and sometimes required other evidence to extrapolate the reference.\n \n I believe one of the more overwhelming testimonies regarding the depth of archeological evidence for the New Testament is in the account of the famous historian and archeologist Sir William Ramsay. Ramsay was very skeptical of the accuracy of the New Testament, and he ventured to Asia minor over a century ago to refute its historicity. He especially took interest in Luke's accounts in the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts, which contained numerous geographical and historic references. Dig after dig the evidence without fail supported Luke's accounts. Governors mentioned by Luke that many historians never believe existed were confirmed by the evidence excavated by Ramsay's archeological team. Without a single error, Luke was accurate in naming 32 countries, 54 cities, and 9 islands. Ramsay became so overwhelmed with the evidence he eventually converted to Christianity. Ramsay finally had this to say:\n \n \"I began with a mind unfavorable to it...but more recently I found myself brought into contact with the Book of Acts as an authority for the topography, antiquities, and society of Asia Minor. It was gradually borne upon me that in various details the narrative showed marvelous truth3. \n \n Luke is a historian of the first rank; not merely are his statements of fact trustworthy...this author should be placed along with the very greatest historians.\"\n\n \n So, not only does the Bible have the undeniable hand of God, but it also is THE MOST accurate historic book. One of the sources in the above said that IT HAS NEVER BEEN CONTRODICTED BY AN ARCHEOLOGICAL FIND.\n \n I'm still not done. In the Bible, a massive amount of scientific principles can be found. Here is the link that I posted:\n \n http://www.bibleevidences.com/scientif.htm\n \n Please, let this sink in:\n \n \nThe Earth and Space\n \n The earth's shape is perhaps the most important to deal with first since many critics claim that the Bible portrays the earth as flat. This couldn't be farther from the truth and in my opinion is one of the most vaporous arguments used by skeptics against the Bible. There is not a single passage that plainly states that the earth is flat1. The groundswell of this criticism gets its roots from the inaccurate but common belief among many that the ancients on up through the middle ages believed that the earth was flat. The truth is, virtually all learned people have known for the last 2500 years that the earth is spherical [please see footnote 2].\n \n Before the learned ancients surmised that the earth was spherical, the divinely inspired Isaiah wrote \"It is He who sits above the circle of the earth...(NKJ, Isaiah 40:22)\". In addition, from the Book of Job we have \"He stretches out the north over empty space; he hangs the earth on nothing (NKJ, Job 26:7)\". It should be noted that just last century scientists believed space consisted of a hypothetical substance called Ether (not the chemical), which was the medium between the celestial bodies. Also, the pagans of that time believed in such things as a mythical Atlas character who supported the pillars that held heaven and earth apart, and later carried the earth around on his shoulders. Another interesting tidbit that illuminates the divine nature of Job 26:7 is the recent discovery of a huge hole in space in the direction of the northern hemisphere3.\n\n \n I can think of no other name for this except one: proof for Christianity. And this is just the Bible. But we still have one more thing to deal with, and thats evolution. Many people here seem to think that the Bible and evolution can mix, but, as Genesis 5:1-2 says:\n \n \"When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God. 2 He made them male and female and blessed them. And when they were created, he called them \"man.\"\"\n \n Anyone with even a basic knowledge of evolution knows that this is not what evolution claims happend.\n \n So, what have we seen?\n \n 1) The Bible claims to be the word of God.\n \n 2) The Bible is the word of God.\n \n 3) The Bible and Evolution cannot possibly mix.\n \n Do you need more proof? I have it. First, lets all understand the above.",

However,archelogy has found out that Jerico was destroyed 200 years before Joshua.\n \n The bible claims that Joshua destoyed ai. Archelogy discovered Ai was destroyed 1200 years before Joshua\n \n The bible claims there were several million hebrews wandering the sinia desert for 40 years during the exodus.\n \n Science has proven that the sinia desert can not support that number of people for that long. The remains of the camps, traces that number of people\n would have left are conspicuouly missing. On the other hand, there is a lot of good evidence that the hebrews developed from the Caananites, which contradicts the biblical claims.\n \n As for your claim 'evolution and christanity don't mix'.. there are many evolutionary biologists that accept evolution. I guess that blows that claim out of the water. You can look up biologist Kenneth Miller , a devout christian that is an outspoken critic of 'scientific creationism', and GLenn Miller, who became a geologist to try to 'prove' Young earth creationism, and instead decieded there was overwhelming evidence for an old earth and for evolution.",

But, of course, there were perfectly good words for town or village or settlement even back then that could have been used. In order to make your argument effective, it seems that it would require either knowledge or references to the work of knowledgeable individuals regarding first and second century linguistics.

Are you debating me, or trying to find the truth?\n \n I looked it up in my Webster.\n \n From the Websters Thesaurus.  \n \n \"Urban:\n \n Synonyms burghal, city, municipal\n Related Word inner city; metropolitan; civic, popular, public; oppidan, town, village\"\n \n \nUnproven assertions mean nothing also.

Btw, I counted more than 50 unproven assertions that you have made since your first post after I made my post.\n \n \nYou did NOT provide evidence. You made a list of links that made assertions. Those links used bad logic, distorted facts, and invalid assumptions. One invalid assumption is that the Kosher laws showed advanced medical knowledge. You made the claim.. but the links and the claim does not match up with reality. \n\n \n Can you please demonstrate this, provide evidence, and stop asserting things? Thank you. :) \n \n \nI am going to say that you are very much wrong ther. I woudl say that informed Christians who belive in the bible can certain not reject evolution. Or, will you say that John Paul the second was not an informed christian, and are you saying he did not believe in the bible? How about one of his predicessors, Pope Pius XII? It sounds to me you drew a line in the sand, and won't listen to reason.\n\n \n I'm not catholic, so I really don't want to get into an argument about this. Lets just say that those popes either did not read this verse, or did not believe the Bible. There are no other way to believe, following the platform of logic.",

   "Lets go over this again, seeing as I was not understood the first time. \n \n Now, if all of you try to objectively understand what I'm saying, you will see my point.\nOh. I understood you the first time. But you claimed to have presented arguments and evidence. You didn't. Why should anyone look at your religious claims objectively since they are strictly subjective when you are unwilling to take an objective look at empirical evidence of science?\n \nThesis statement:\n The Bible contains the undeniable hand of God. Since the Bible does not support the ideas of evolution, abiogenesis, and aitheism those ideas must be flawed. I can go into other reasons that evolution is flawed if you wish.\n End thesis statement.\n \n ^Did you understand that?\nYes. I certainly did. But I deny out of hand that the Bible contains the undeniable hand of God. What you are claiming is that you don't have faith. Of course the Bible does not support evolution of abiogenesis because those ideas were unheard of for about 3 millennia after Genesis was written. By the same token, the Bible doesn't support plumbing, aeronautics, orbital mechanics, physics, bacteriology, x-ray, MRIs, CT scans, internal combustion engines, computers, and so forth. So I guess it means that all of those ideas are flawed too. I don't know what \"aitheism\" is or why it is important, or why or how it applies to evolutionary theory or abiogenesis - the Bible either for that matter.\n \nAlrighty, let us take a look at the arguments and evidence that I have presented, with quotes and explanations for easier reading.\nLooks like the same stuff you posted before, which is neither arguments nor evidence.\n \nFirst of all, we need to understand several things:\n \n 1) The Bible claims to be inspired by God.\nSo does the Qur'an.\n \nAGAIN: How do you explain this without God?\nThey could have learned by observation and practice. There is no reason to believe that they had to be informed of these things by God. The Bible contains tribal laws. That is why they were written there. Not much of an argument. Not convincing.\n \nThe bible also has been proven the aboslute MOST ACCURATE ANCIENT HISTORICAL BOOK by tens of thousands of archeological finds.\nNot from what I've read. Someone else already pointed out some of the errors of the Bible as to Joshua. I've heard of more. But still, that isn't verification for God's inspiration of the Bible, and even if some of the Bible is correct, how does that mean that all of it is? Again, not a convincing argument. It lacks any real substance.\n \nIn the Bible, a massive amount of scientific principles can be found.\nDo you mean the part about how bats are birds, grasshoppers have 4 legs, and rabbits chew the cud? Scientific parts like that? The assertion about the Hebrews knowing that the earth was not flat is hogwash. Biblical cosmology clearly reflects a flat earth. It was thought to be a flat circle covered by a dome (the firmament) with windows for rain and water above and water below. And very clearly the Bible states that God hung the sun, moon and the stars on the dome of the firmament.\n \n I guess you prefer a quite free interpretation of the Bible rather than a literal one. If that is the case, why insist the Genesis is true at all? If you are going to distort it, why not just recognize that it is allegorical, composed of mythology?\n \nI can think of no other name for this except one: proof for Christianity.\nOne other name for it comes to mind - proof of Judaism. Nothing you have posted has anything to do with Christianity.\n \nMany people here seem to think that the Bible and evolution can mix,...\nPersonally, I don't care.\n \nSo, what have we seen?\n \n 1) The Bible claims to be the word of God.\nSo does the Qur'an. So what?\n \n2) The Bible is the word of God.\nYou haven't presented any evidence that would lead someone to that conclusion. Your bare assertion is meaningless.\n \n3) The Bible and Evolution cannot possibly mix.\nThat isn't my problem. Actually, lots of Christians have no problem with any of the sciences and the Bible. Most of them are more educated in both Christianity and science than you.\n \nDo you need more proof? I have it. First, lets all understand the above.\nMore? You haven't presented any. And I suspect that you \"flaws\" in evolution will be based on ignorance and your reading from some ministry more concerned with money than truth.",

   "Also, your \"awsomely advanced egyptions\" were totally unscientific: take a look at this excert from the article. Btw, as I clearly outlined in my post, the Bible is completely scientific\n \n \nMedical Knowledge and Philosophy\n \n Egyptians believed that disease and death were never natural or inevitable. The most commonly held hypothesis stated that disease was caused by some powerful spirit which might use any means, natural or unnatural, visable or invisable to cause the disease. This was refered to as wekhedu (translated as morbid principle or rot). The medical papyri make specific mention of these things which enter the body from the outside. \"The breath of life enters into the right ear and the breath of death enters into the left ear\" Ebers papyrus(854f). Another mention is from the Edwin Smith Papyrus (Case 8) \"As for something entering from the outside, it means the breath of an outside god or death. It is not an entering of that which is created by his own flesh.\" \n \n Egyptian physicians had developed a theory of \"metu\" (translated as tubes). The metu included blood vessels, arteries, ducts, nerves, tendons and muscles. These tubes ran between the heart and the anus and then went to various parts of the body. In the medical texts the physician often specifies what the particular met (singular form of metu) was carrying, such as blood, air, mucus, urine, semen, water, feces and good or evil spirits. \n \n In this theory, disease arises when wekhedu travels through the metu. Once inside, it could stick, grow and spread, causing dental problems, stomach cramps, eye infections, fevers, mental illness, tumors and so on. Early scientists and physicians had so closely observed the course of disease they could theorize there was an unseeable thing (wekhedu) that infected the patient (their words \"stick, grow and spread\"), causing illness. Today we believe that unseen (without a microscope) bacteria and viruses invade the body from the outside, stick, grow and spread, causing illness. Not so different after all. \n \n \n",

   "Ancient surgery was surprisingly successful. There was an excellent chance of recovering from an operation. Several examples exist of cranial surgery, probably to repair skulls smashed during battle. There are only a few examples of trepaning (cutting a hole in the skull for unknown reasons) that are often seen in other ancient cultures. All of those found however, show bone growth around the removed bone section. This indicates that the patients lived after the surgery for some time. Evidence of bone setting, draining cysts, pulling teeth and removal of growths has been found during examination of mummies. A recently examined mummy, found in the necropolis at Thebes, had a delicately carved wooden prosthetic toe complete with toenail to replace one that had been amputated. It had attached to her foot with a fine linen lace. In later periods caesarian sections are attested to by two tomb paintings. There is no evidence of other abdominal surgery. \n Wounds were treated with willow bark (the original source of asprin) and moldy bread compresses (known to contain antibiotics), kept clean through ritual bathing and infection free through the regular application of honey (known even today as an excellent anti- bacterial). Before operations, patients were given numbing agents including opium and belladonna, as well as others. The knives and scalpels were heated to cauterize wounds which stops bleeding. This provided an (at the time) unknown benefit, sterilized instruments. These facts help put to rest the idea that ancient people's medical knowledge was undeveloped, potentially dangerous and mostly ineffective.\n\n \n Yes, and they were also treated very commonly with animal dung, saw dust, and variose other fast-killing medicines.

The resulting germs would have quickly infected and killed a great many patients.\n \n In sharp contrast, the Scriptures reveal advanced sanitation methods that were not understood by the scientific medical community until after World War 1! In fact, a total of 213 of the 613 biblical commandments found in the Torah--one third of the Law of Moses--were detailed medical regulations that insured the health of the Israelites if they obediently followed the laws of God.\n\n \n Some of these advanced medicals:\n \n \"Blood as the force of life\"\n \n \"Germs and bacterial infections\"\n \n \"Advanced disinfectant solution\"\n \n \"The optimal time for surgery\"\n \n If you want more information, please take a look at these links:\n \n http://www.bibleevidences.com/medical.htm\n http://www.newhope.bc.ca/98-01-11.htm\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v17/i1/medicine.asp\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v26/i1/hygiene.asp\n \n Now that we clearly understand the content of my link, we can discuss it with a general understanding.\n \n TS",

I have presented several qualified links, most of which quote historians and doctors.\n \n Second, the Egyptians used the process of elimination, as is well documented in history. It goes something like this: \"Lets see what happens if we put insect legs and arsenic on a wound, and call upon our 'gods' to heal the wound. Well, that didn't work, so lets try something else.\" If, after literally thousands of tries, the came across something that appeared to help, they would keep it. But, documented history shows us that the end results that Egyptians achieved were much less than those achieved by the teachings in the Bible. Here is why we know this: the Hebrews, unlike the Egyptians, obtained medical practices from God that could not have been gotten from the process of elimination. Read through these links:\n \n http://www.bibleevidences.com/medical.htm\n http://www.newhope.bc.ca/98-01-11.htm\n http://www.pytlik.com/observe/deliverus/signature-05.html\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v17/i1/medicine.asp\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v26/i1/hygiene.asp\n \n Now, lets pull a sample:\n \n \nCircumcision and Blood Clotting\n For centuries scholars must have been perplexed by God's law of circumcision which required the procedure to be performed on the 8th day after birth (Gen 17:12, Gen 21:14, Lev 12:3, Luke 2:21). Medical researchers recently discovered that the two main blood clotting factors, Vitamin K and Prothrombim, reach their highest level in life, about 110% of normal, on the 8th day after birth. These blood clotting agents facilitate rapid healing and greatly reduce the chance of infection. You can verify with any Obstetrician that the 8th day of life is the ideal time for a circumcision, and that any circumcision done earlier requires an injection of Vitamin K supplement.\n\n Please demonstrate how this could have been achieved by random, trial and error methods. Remember, no other civilization on earth even circumcised at that time, and even today, the only reason that we sometimes circumcise is because we know that that bacteria infections can result from not doing so.\n \n And, lastly, realize that none of your arguments affect my end conclusion in the very least: you have only attacked a small part of my argument.\n \n \nAs a final point, can I ask why this discussion is in a creation and evolution thread rather than the science or religion ones?\n\n \n Because of verses in the Bible like Genesis 5:1-2, \"In the beginning, He [meaning God] made them male and female.\" Such verses, from a book clearly inspired by God, should be taken into account before deciding that creationism is false.\n \n In case your wondering what my entire argument is, much of it can be found on this website:\n \n www.bibleevidences.com",

It's \"proper\" term is empiricism. It is employed by doctors the world over even today. It's not as good as the scientific method, but since it doesn't involve nasty ethical issues of mass human use as \"controls\", it's generally regarded as somewhat more suitable for use in medicine. The Bible writers may have employed the same techniques. They alternatively (and more likely) simply plagerised Egyptian medical knowledge.\n \n \nhttp://www.bibleevidences.com/medical.htm\n http://www.newhope.bc.ca/98-01-11.htm\n http://www.pytlik.com/observe/deliverus/signature-05.html\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v17/i1/medicine.asp\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v26/i1/hygiene.asp\nHmm, more of those \"less than unbiased\" links.

There are even bas reliefs of the Egyptians doing it around 4000BC (eg http://www.noharmm.org/paige.htm about 4/5ths the way down)\n \n \nBecause of verses in the Bible like Genesis 5:1-2, &#8220;In the beginning, He [meaning God] made them male and female.&#8221; Such verses, from a book clearly inspired by God, should be taken into account before deciding that creationism is false.\nNo really they shouldn't. One should concentrate upon objective evidence, not some random religious text when considering origins. That aside, perhaps you could focus your argument a bit therefore. Remove the irrelvent stuff that needs ridiculing upon another thread (the advanced medicine in the Bible joke) and concentrate upon the bit that applies to creation here.",

Obviously a myth. Light was produced before any body that produces light. \n \n Second, another magical being who creates a garden, a man, lots of animals, and then after encouraging beastiality, finally creates woman as a proper partner.

Perhaps a few hundred. This includes every single creature, from the lowliest virus to the blue whale. There is absolutely zero evidence to support this.\n \n OR\n \n 2 - Noah actually took two (and importantly, only two) of every kind of creature on the earth, and made them inhabit an artificially created habitat for an entire year. There are several obvious problems with this. Since the entire world was covered with water, the delicate balances of water chemistry would have been upset. All creatures living in the water unable to adapt to this change would have died. Most creatures are unable to cope with this change, including whale species. How did Noah fit two of every species of whale on the ship, complete with state of the art water recycling and filtration systems?\n \n What did the carnivorous animals eat? They couldn't have eaten other animals, since there was only two of each. They are not physically able (and no mention in the bible is made of them being able) to eat plants.\n \n What about the plants? There are untold millions of different plant species. Were all of these collected and cared for as well?\n \n How was the power for all the recycling systems generated?\n \n How did the animals from other continents get to the arc?

A light year is the distance light travles in one year. Thus, if something is millions of light years away, it would take millions of years for the light from that thing to reach us.

   "how old may i ask? and if you say millions of years prove it also. \n\n \n How old does radiometric dating show the Earth and the Universe to be? Much older than 10 thousand years: about 4.5 billion years for the Earth, and therefore, at least that old for the Universe.\n \n For various reasons (subduction, erosion, volcanism, impact events, etc.), scientists cannot get their hands on the rocks that formed the Earth's original surface. But they do have access to rocks of great antiquity. Using a variety of different radioisotopes to calculate the age of one group of rocks gave consistent results of 3.7 billion year.\n \n \n\"The oldest rocks exposed on the surface of the earth are 3.5 to 3.8 billion years in age. Consider the various dating methods applied to the Greenland Amitsoq Gneiss: \n \n Rb-Sr isochron 3.70 +- 0.14 billion years\n Pb-Pb isochron 3.80 +- 0.12 billion years\n U-Pb discordia 3.65 +- 0.05 billion years\n Th-Pb discordia 3.65 +- 0.08 billion years\n Lu-Hf isochron 3.55 +- 0.22 billion years\n \n Note that all of the methods agree (3.68-3.70 is within all of their ranges of error). Isochron and discordia methods also have an internal check which identifies undateable samples. Similar formations which give similar ages can be found as well in North America, India, Russia, Australia, and Africa. This date therefore merits some confidence.\" \n (http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/debate-age-of-earth.html) \n\n \n To get a better idea of how old the Earth itself (not just its' oldest exposed rocks) is, we need to switch to looking at other bodies in the solar system; ones that unlike the Earth are geologically and meteorologically dead. Two prime candidates are the moon and meteorites. Do the results of applying radiometric dating methods to them produce results consistent with the results obtained using the Earth's oldest exposed rocks? Yes. \n \n In order to determine the age of a class of meteorites known as carbonaceous chondrites, several groups of scientists measured the age of CAIs (calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions) found in them.\n \n \n\"In contrast to the relative age dating achieved with 26Al-26Mg radioactive decay, absolute formation ages of CAIs and chondrules may be measured with the 207Pb/206Pb [lead-207/lead-206] chronometer. This lead-lead age is based on radioactive decay of two long-lived radioactive isotopes 235U [uranium-235] and 238U [uranium-238]. The uncertainties of 207Pb/206Pb dates can be as low as 0.5-1.5 My [million years], thus the 207Pb/206Pb chronometer may be suitable for resolving a potential 2-3 My age difference between CAIs and chondrules. C. All\u00e9gre, G. Manhes, and C. G\u00f6pel (Paris Geophysical Institute) report an impressively precise Pb-Pb age of 4566\u00b12 Ma for CAIs from the Allende CV chondrite.\" (http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Sept02/isotopicAges.html) \n\n \n Thus, the calcium-aluminum inclusions contained in the meteorites were radiometrically dated to 4.566 billion years (plus or minus 2 million years). And as science demands, the general results were repeatable.\n \n \n\"In our recently published paper in Science magazine, we report Pb-Pb isochron ages for two CAIs (E60 and E49) from the CV carbonaceous chondrite Efremovka and a similarly precise Pb isotopic age for chondrules from the CR carbonaceous chondrite Acfer 059. We also report the 26Al-26Mg systematics for the CAI E60. \n \n The Pb-Pb isochron age for the Acfer 059 chondrules is 4564.7\u00b10.6 Ma. The weighted average Pb-Pb isochron age for the Efremovka CAIs is 4567.2\u00b10.6 Ma.\" (http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Sept02/isotopicAges.html) \n\n \n Switching to second candidate for undisturbed rocks, radiometric dating of the oldest lunar rocks produced ages remarkably consistent with the values for the CAIs from meteorites.\n \n \n\n Description Technique Age (billions of years)\n Apollo 17 Rb-Sr isochron 4.55 +- 0.1 \n Apollo 17 Rb-Sr isochron 4.60 +- 0.1 \n Apollo 17 Rb-Sr isochron 4.49 \n Apollo 17 Rb-Sr isochron 4.43 +- 0.05 \n Apollo 17 Sm-Nd isochron 4.23 +- 0.05 \n Apollo 17 Sm-Nd isochron 4.34 +- 0.05 \n Apollo 16 40Ar/39Ar 4.47 \n Apollo 16 40Ar/39Ar 4.42 \n (http://www.gate.net/~rwms/AgeEarth.html)\n \n\n \n Sticking with the dating of moon samples for a minute, we can see the high degree of internal consistency produced by applying multiple dating methods to a single sample (note however, that it is not one of the oldest moon rocks). The following table is based on one at http://www.gate.net/~rwms/AgeEarth.html (which itself lists as its reference for this data, \"Age of the Earth\", G. Brent Dalrymple, 1991). The data pertain to the dating a single moon rock brought back by Apollo 11, sample 10072.\n \n \n\n Technique Age (billions of years)\n 40Ar/39Ar whole rock 3.49 +- 0.05 \n 40Ar/39Ar whole rock 3.52 +- 0.04 \n 40Ar/39Ar plagioclase 3.57 +- 0.05 \n 40Ar/39Ar plagioclase 3.56 +- 0.06 \n 40Ar/39Ar ilmenite 3.58 +- 0.05 \n 40Ar/39Ar pyroxene 3.55 +- 0.05 \n Rb-Sr isochron 3.57 +- 0.05 \n Sm-Nd isochron 3.57 +- 0.03 \n \n\n \n So whether radiometrically dating (1) exposed rocks on Earth, (2) basaltic rocks retrieved from the moon, or (3) calcium-aluminum inclusions in meteorites, the results all point to an Earth that is about 4.5 billion years old, and not one of them is consistent, at all, with a Biblically young Earth. Further, not only were multiple objects dated, but multiple methods for calculating were used, and all results produced were found to be consistent.\n \n YECs do not accept such findings, of course; they attempt to dismiss them by challenging the validity of radiometric dating itself (note that, again, instead of supporting their own position, as real scientists do, the YECs attempt to attack the opposing position). \n \n While scientists openly admit that radiometric dating methods don't give exact ages, the relatively small error ranges are in no way compatible with the Creationists' claims. For example, the uranium-lead radiometric measurement of the Earth's oldest exposed rocks yielded an age of 3.65 billion years, plus or minus 50 million years; this spread in no way allows for the Earth to be just 10,000 years old. Thus these ranges in calculations (plus or minus a few million years) cannot be used by Creationists to reject the scientific conclusion, nor to support their own YEC position.\n \n Very rarely, an anomalous date might be produced by radiometric dating methods. For example, attempts to date a single lava flow that was known to have occurred in 1801 in Hawaii apparently failed: researchers used the decay of potassium into argon but the resulting age was not a mere 100 or 200 years, but 160 million years! Worse, the upper limit was 3 billion years! As one might expect, YECs jumped all over these findings. Might these be legitimate Creationist concerns? No. A single anomalous result dating a recent Hawaiian lava flow, using a single radioisotope, does not invalidate the vast amount of consistent results everywhere else: radiometric dating is accurate, even if a rare exception happened to pop up. For example, concerning the ages of the oldest exposed Earth rocks, in order to double check - no, triple check - no quadruple check - the results, a total of five different radioisotope decay sequences were employed for the same rock formations ... and, all five methods produced results that were extremely consistent with one another. And of course, there is also the fact that radiometric dates were calculated using meteorites, and these too were consistent, both within themselves and with those based on the exposed Earth rocks. And, a slew of radiometric dates based on moon samples were also all internally consistent, as well as being consistent with the multiply checked dates based on meteorites and Earth rocks. The fact that so many different results are all internally consistent, as well as being consistent across the vary different objects dated, tells us something to be sure: the dates are valid. Does a single anomalous result from a measurement of how old a Hawaiian lava flow is show that all of these multiply checked and consistent values are complete rubbish? Of course not. \n \n One might still feel unsatisfied with the above counter to the Creationist's apparently strong evidence of, though unique, a grossly inaccurate result. Not to worry, just as YECs did and continue to do, I (though for completely different reasons) intentionally left out some details. The fact is that the results of interest were not anomalous: Creationists just made them appear to be.\n \n \n\"[The Young-Earth Creationist] Morris cited a study by Funkhouser and Norton - \"Radiogenic Helium and Argon in Ultramafic Inclusions from Hawaii\" published in the Journal of Geophysics Research, vol. 73, pgs. 4601 - 4607. What Morris didn't bother to inform his readers was that the study concerned xenoliths - fragments of foreign rock broken off by the magmas intrusion through the crust. Since they are not completely melted by the magma, they are in fact much older than the lava flow (with K/Ar dating, what you are really dating is how long it has been since the rock solidified from the molten state - at this point the daughter Argon can no longer escape from the rock). That particular study confirmed (as geologists already suspected) that xenoliths could not be properly dated with the K/Ar method. The Funkhouser and Norton study clearly stated that the \"ages\" determined by K/Ar dating had no geological meaning and also determined that the xenoliths contained excess argon trapped in \"air\" bubbles inside the rock. Of course there was no mention of these details by Morris or any of the internet postings I have seen that still list this \"problem\" - despite the fact that Dalrymple answered it over 10 years ago. In the same paper, Dalrymple goes on to describe in detail several other quotes taken out of context by Creationists.\" (http://www.gate.net/~rwms/AgeEarth.html) \n\n \n So the radiometric data stand: the Earth, moon, and older meteorites are all between 4 and 4.5 billion years old.\n \n Note the central importance of radiometric dating to the Creation vs. evolution debate. For example, when using a variety of independent genetic similarities between humans and chimpanzees to try to demonstrate descent from a common ancestor, some Creationists have been known to claim that such a conclusion can only be arrived at if one already assumes that something existed prior to God's creating man (and chimp) about 10,000 years go. To show there is reason to believe that such was the case, a scientist can point to fossils of Australopithecus anamensis, Australopithecus afarensis, Australopithecus africanus, Homo habilis, Homo erectus, and Homo ergaster as being potential ancestors of humans, all of which date back well beyond 10,000 years ago...some to millions of years. But, the Creationist can respond by claiming that those \"pre-humans\" didn't actually exist that long ago, because radiometric dating methods are completely worthless. Obviously, such an assertion is flawed. When multiple, different radioisotopes are used for dating, each helps establish the validity of the other (besides, geological evidence also confirms that these \"pre-humans\" lived before modern humans did: their remains are found only in strata lower in the geological column than are the remains of any modern humans).",

   "how old may i ask? and if you say millions of years prove it also. \n\n \n \nHow old does radiometric dating show the Earth and the Universe to be? Much older than 10 thousand years: about 4.5 billion years for the Earth, and therefore, at least that old for the Universe. ...\n\n \n In addition to the radiometric data I laid out in my previous post, there is also the fact (which has been brought up previously in this or another recent thread here) that astronomers are detecting light from galaxies that are 10 or more billions of light years distant. This poses a problem for YECs.\n \n According to the Big Bang theory, our Universe began about 13.7 billion years ago. As their telescopes improved over the years, astronomers have been able to peer farther and farther back in time. Many observations have now been made of regions of space that are over 10 billion light years distant. Therefore, it has taken the light from them more than 10 billion years to reach us. But Young-Earth Creationists claim the Universe is only 6 to 10 thousand years old. If that were true, then how could astronomers be seeing objects that are 10 billion light years distant? How could light travel 10 billion light years in only 10 thousand years? YECs often use the same general logic as they do for other phenomena that contradict their religious views: God just did it that way ... He created the Universe mature. \n \n Since science says that 6,000 years ago there were photons from a galaxy 10 billion light years away headed towards Earth, YECs just claim that when God created those distant stars He also placed some of their photons already en route to the Earth at various distances, making it falsely appear as though a continuous stream of photons has been leaving those stars for the past 10 billion years. In other words, for virtually every star in the Universe, God supposedly, just 6 or 10 thousand years ago, placed some divinely created photons at a distance of 9.999999999999 billion light years away from Earth, another batch of divinely created photons forming this same continuous stream at 9.999999999998 billion light years distant, and few more divinely created photons forming this same continuous stream 9.999999999997 billion light years distant, and so on down the line, all the way to the Earth's surface. So we are now supposedly seeing photons that were created just 6 thousand years ago (divinely created, not by the star) and placed perfectly to create the illusion that the star has been emitting photons for 10 billion years. Actually, God's deceit would require more. For every star that God fabricated a continuous en route photon stream for, He would actually have to had created a billion or trillion such individual streams so that astronomers all over the Earth would see the same false evidence. Why would God go to all of this trouble of planting an astronomical amount of misleading photons all across the Universe, in all directions, making it falsely appear that the stars and galaxies that are billions of light years distant are actually billions of years old? Deceit? Sounds like it to me. \n \n Let's see if we can easily come up with a satisfactory explanation - besides deceit - that God would have done so. \n \n Could it be so that plants on Earth could photosynthesize? No, because the Sun is all plants need. They don't require any stars from outside our own solar system, let alone from outside our own galaxy, let alone from outside our own galaxy cluster.\n \n Could it be so that ancient travelers, like Moses, could navigate? No. First, stars and galaxies billions of light years distant are not even visible with the naked eye, so they could not possibly be used for navigation. Second, there are many stars within a 10,000-light-year radius from Earth - which would be visible to the naked eye - that could serve for navigation. Just to give an idea of how close some of the stars in a few main constellations are...\n \n Big Dipper: Those listed on a diagram are 68, 78, 88, 105, and 210 light-years distant. http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/ast99/ast99237.htm\n \n Ursa Major: Those listed are 50, 65, 70, 80, 90, and 210 light-years distant.\n http://www.geocities.com/~smalltelescope/constellations/ursamajor/ursamaj2.html\n \n Draco: Those listed are 65, 93, 110, 215, and 400 light-years distant.\n http://starryskies.com/The_sky/constellations/draco.html\n \n Draco: Those listed are 88, 99, 110, 188, 289, 322, 397, 1186, and 1500 - 3500 light-years distant.\n http://www.kyes-world.com/DracoskyPRINTABLE.htm\n \n Ursa Minor: Those listed are 110, 240, and 350 light-years distant.\n http://starryskies.com/The_sky/constellations/ursa_minor.html\n \n Orion: Those listed are 300, 650, 800 (a total of 2 different stars), 1600, and 2000 light-years distant.\n http://starryskies.com/The_sky/constellations/orion.html\n \n So we could find no satisfactory explanation for why God would intentionally deceive the world by planting trillions upon trillions of photons, throughout the entire known Universe, in exactly the arrangement needed to mislead scientists across the globe into believing that stars billions of light years away are billions of years old. \n \n Furthermore, the YEC explanation is far more involved and complex, and requires more and far greater assumptions, than does the straightforward scientific explanation. So both rational thought and Ockham's razor would have us jettison the religious explanation and accept the scientific one.",

They don't exist now and didn't exist 10 thousand years ago. So why would God have created the illusion that something that never existed in His universe - quasars - did exist billions of years ago? That takes deceit to a whole new level.\n \n The word quasar comes from \"quasi stellar\" and refers to small (solar-system size) but extremely energetic sources of energy (output as much energy as large galaxies). More importantly, it is now known that quasars lie at great distances from our own galaxy (the theories that suggested they were local have been discredited by multiple lines of compelling evidence). The key is that quasars only occur at vast distances from the Earth, which means they occurred only in the very distant past: billions of years ago, for example. In fact, the existence of quasars is one line of evidence that discredits the steady-state theory of the Universe: the Universe was different in the distant past than it is now...quasars no longer occur. Quasars fit in nicely with the Big Bang and standard cosmological models that allow for billions of years.\n \n What's the Young-Earth Creationist's explanation for quasars? Well, they can't simply deny that quasars exist. So did God purposely fake out scientists by creating the illusion that there were once many quasars billions of years ago, even though God never actually created any quasars in his Universe?

I suspected as much. I'm sure that much of it was over your head and once you got past the first sentence you were bored because you didn't understand any of it. I notice that you didn't respond to anything he said.\n \nGenerally, you need to get right to the point, say it, and try to hold on to your position. More specifically for your case, make one argument at a time.\nHe did. Isn't it amazing that you didn't recognize that he covered a single point in each post? First he covered radiometric dating, then distant galaxies, then quasars, and then the CMBR. He did exactly what you say he didn't do. The problem is that the \"creation science\" world in which you dwell works by sound bite - the whole argument in a single assertion - no observation, no evidence, no logic. Real science takes longer, and that is one of the ways that you can differentiate real science from pseudoscience (like \"creation science\"). If you don't understand the science, you get swamped and bored and then make yourself look foolish by telling the poster that he should have done exactly what he did.\n \nOf course, you already knew this. emoticon_rolleyes\nBut apparently you didn't.",

   "Not only does science show that the Earth (and Universe) are mutiple billions of years old (the radiometric data I listed being a real killer for YECs), there's also the fact that YECs' \"flood geology\" is not supported by geological observations, and is in fact, contradicted by the facts.\n \n Here is what one former-YEC had to say about how geology not only doesn't support \"the flood\" model, but actually counters it. Emphasis has been added.\n \n \n \"Why I left Young-earth Creationism by Glenn R. Morton \n \n Copyright 2000 by Glenn R. Morton. This may be freely distributed so long as no changes are made to the text and no charges are made to the reader. \n \n For years I struggled to understand how the geologic data I worked with everyday could be fit into a Biblical perspective. Being a physics major in college I had no geology courses. Thus, as a young Christian, when I was presented with the view that Christians must believe in a young-earth and global flood, I went along willingly. I knew there were problems but I thought I was going to solve them. When I graduated from college with a physics degree, physicists were unemployable since NASA had just laid a bunch of them off. I did graduate work in philosophy and then decided to leave school to support my growing family. Even after a year, physicists were still unemployable. After six months of looking, I finally found work as a geophysicist working for a seismic company. Within a year, I was processing seismic data for Atlantic Richfield. \n \n This was where I first became exposed to the problems geology presented to the idea of a global flood. I would see extremely thick (30,000 feet) sedimentary layers. One could follow these beds from the surface down to those depths where they were covered by vast thicknesses of sediment. I would see buried mountains which had experienced thousands of feet of erosion, which required time. Yet the sediments in those mountains had to have been deposited by the flood, if it was true. I would see faults that were active early but not late and faults that were active late but not early. I would see karsts and sinkholes (limestone erosion) which occurred during the middle of the sedimentary column (supposedly during the middle of the flood) yet the flood waters would have been saturated in limestone and incapable of dissolving lime. It became clear that more time was needed than the global flood would allow. (See http://www.seg.org/publications/geoarchive/1996/sep-oct/geo6105r1336.pdf for an article showing an example of a deeply buried karst. For a better but bigger (3.4 meg) version of that paper see http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/proceedings/97/97ng/ng97_pdf/NG4-1.pdf\n \n One also finds erosional canyons buried in the earth. These canyons would require time to excavate, just like the time it takes to erode the Grand Canyon. This picture was downloaded from a site which is now gone from the web. It was \n http://ic.ucsc.edu/~casey/eart168/3DInterpretation/Deltain3d1.gif\n \n I worked hard over the next few years to solve these problems. I published 20+ items in the Creation Research Society Quarterly. I would listen to ICR, have discussions with people like Slusher, Gish, Austin, Barnes and also discuss things with some of their graduates that I had hired. \n \n In order to get closer to the data and know it better, with the hope of finding a solution, I changed subdivisions of my work in 1980. I left seismic processing and went into seismic interpretation where I would have to deal with more geologic data. My horror at what I was seeing only increased. There was a major problem; the data I was seeing at work, was not agreeing with what I had been taught as a Christian. Doubts about what I was writing and teaching began to grow. Unfortunately, my fellow young earth creationists were not willing to listen to the problems. No one could give me a model which allowed me to unite into one cloth what I believed on Sunday and what I was forced to believe by the data Monday through Friday. I was living the life of a double-minded man--believing two things. \n By 1986, the growing doubts about the ability of the widely accepted creationist viewpoints to explain the geologic data led to a nearly 10 year withdrawal from publication. My last young-earth paper was entitled Geologic Challenges to a Young-earth, which I presented as the first paper in the First International Conference on Creationism. It was not well received. Young-earth creationists don't like being told they are wrong. The reaction to the pictures, seismic data, the logic disgusted me. They were more interested in what I sounded like than in the data! ...\" (http://home.entouch.net/dmd/gstory.htm) \n",

   "I'd say the most crushing is the most obvious and simple.\n \n The fact that we can see stars that are farther away than 6000 ly.\n\n \n I agree that that is crushing, but actually, not neccesarily to a Young-Earth position. Someone could potentially offer a position where the UNIVERSE is billions of years old, but EARTH is just 6 to 10 thousand years old. That would fit the starlight evidence.\n \n But the radiometrically determined ages of exposed rocks here on Earth, at ~3.5 billion years, is the best direct evidence for an old Earth.\n \n Consider just this one quote.\n \n \n\"The oldest rocks exposed on the surface of the earth are 3.5 to 3.8 billion years in age. Consider the various dating methods applied to the Greenland Amitsoq Gneiss: \n \n Rb-Sr isochron 3.70 +- 0.14 billion years\n Pb-Pb isochron 3.80 +- 0.12 billion years\n U-Pb discordia 3.65 +- 0.05 billion years\n Th-Pb discordia 3.65 +- 0.08 billion years\n Lu-Hf isochron 3.55 +- 0.22 billion years\n \n Note that all of the methods agree (3.68-3.70 is within all of their ranges of error). Isochron and discordia methods also have an internal check which identifies undateable samples. Similar formations which give similar ages can be found as well in North America, India, Russia, Australia, and Africa. This date therefore merits some confidence.\" \n (http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/debate-age-of-earth.html) \n\n \n Not directed at you, but for others who aren't up on this, it is important to stress that the dating methods represented in the above table have internal checks by their very design. For example, a reported isochron-derived age has already passed a validation test because the method uses multiple data points, and checks that all points are collinear (for more details on how this validates the data, and eliminates the need to make a couple basic assumptions used in simpler radiometric dating methods, visit http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/isochron-dating.html#isochron). This built-in self-check helps ensure that even a single isochron-derived age, such as the one based on Rb-Sr above, is reliable. Confidence in the correctness of that age is increased when a second isochron-derived age (based on a different parent-daughter set of isotopes, such as the Pb-Pb one above), which also has passed its own internal data-consistency check, is consistent with the first. And when a third isochron-derived age (using yet a third set of isotopes, such as the Lu-Hf isochron above), which also passed its own internal validation, is consistent with the other two isochron-derived ages, there is little doubt that confidence in the values is warranted.\n \n That seems like about as clear-cut, ain't-gonna-be-refuted evidence that the Earth is multiple billions of years old, not just 6 to 10 thousand.",
