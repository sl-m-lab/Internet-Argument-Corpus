   "Is it appropriate for the wife of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to conduct herself in this manner?\n \nThomas Turley criticizes Justices wife for injudicious Tea Party activism. Constitutional law expert Jonathan Turley on Monday assailed the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas for her growing role in Tea Party political activism.\n \n \"It's, in a word, injudicious,\" Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University, said on MSNBC's Countdown With Keith Olbermann. \"The fact that this is news is an example of the self-restraint used by most spouses [of Supreme Court Justices] previously.\"\n\n Turley criticizes Justice's wife for 'injudicious' Tea Party activism | Raw Story\n \n \nIn January, Virginia Thomas created Liberty Central Inc., a nonprofit lobbying group whose website will organize activism around a set of conservative \"core principles,\" she said.\n \n The group plans to issue score cards for Congress members and be involved in the November election, although Thomas would not specify how. She said it would accept donations from various sources -- including corporations -- as allowed under campaign finance rules recently loosened by the Supreme Court. ..\n\n Justice's wife launches 'tea party' group - Los Angeles Times",

Justices are selected by how they are expected to rule.\n \n Justice Thomas is a conservative. In other words he bases his rulings on inherent constitutional grounds and what the founding fathers intended, as do the other conservative justices. \n \n The liberal 'wing' of the SC, on the other hand, are activist, and claim an 'evolving' constitution, such as finding the 'right to privacy' clause as a clearance for unfettered abortion. \n \n So why should the 'activity' of Justice Thomas' wife be any different than the 'activist' bent of the liberal wing?

   " \n \n Also, I cannot recall any other judges in high positions whose spouses have been politically active.\n \n Can you?\n\n \n Ramona Ripston retired from the ACLU after 28 or so years of heading the blooming thing. For 28 of those years -- well, I don't know if it's all 28 -- but for a whole lot of those years, her husband is on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, is the most leftist radical judge on that circus, his name is Stephen Reinhardt. Stephen Reinhardt's married to the head honcho of the ACLU and not once was his impartiality ever questioned. \n \n Oh, no, and she was praised as a liberal lion, and he's always written up that way, too.....\n \n Can't we be a little less transparent?\n \n For crying out loud, Ginni Thomas has worked at the Heritage Foundation. She has worked at Hillsdale College. She helped recruit and educate members of Congress, she's been a legislative assistant, she has helped members of Congress, Republicans, come up with arguments to sell issues. Liberals know all this. Besides, I thought women were supposed to seek their own identities? I thought the feminists had taught us that this is exactly what women should be doing, that they should not be appendages of their husband, that their husband should be appendages of them, uh, if you can picture that. \n \n Anyway, what happened to all that? Do you think that Ginni Thomas is the first spouse of a judge? Ramona Ripston at the ACLU, for crying out loud, with her husband on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. So liberals are squealing like stuck pigs. They will always tell us what they're afraid of, and they're doing it here.\n \n Do you remember the name Hillary Clinton? Hillary Clinton was a spouse. She was a spouse, not of a Supreme Court justice. Hillary Clinton was the spouse of the president of the United States, and because the president of the United States had had dalliances with several women from trailer parks and television studios and pancake houses and so forth, she exacted a price. She got to play a role in policy in order to stay married and present the happy couple face. You don't think there was something unseemly about that? Hillary Clinton was a spouse and last time I looked she's the secretary of state and her husband's an ex-president, and he's running around making speeches all over the place. Where do you guys find the ability to draw the line here when it comes to Clarence Thomas and his wife?\n \n Has anybody ever heard of Tom and Linda Daschle? Tom Daschle was the Senate majority leader, and at the time his wife was a lobbyist working on things that came under, of course, his own work. And they said, \"Oh, no conflict here! No, no, no. Don't worry about it.\" Nobody had a care in the world about it. How many members of the media are married to elected officials, or how many members of the media have spouses who work for the media? I know one spouse. I know one CNN infobabe. Her husband was a prime advisor to Jane Harman. They're since divorced, but I don't think Jane Harman had anything to do with it. I mean, the resolving door between media and government spouses (non-spouses, boyfriends, girlfriends, mistresses, for crying out loud) is all over. It's incestuous in that town. \n \n Now, Nina Totenberg. Nina Totenberg is out there saying, \"Wow, this is unseemly. We can't have the wife of a Supreme Court justice involved in partisan politics.\" She's so concerned, so concerned that Ginni Thomas might create a conflict. This is a reporter, Nina Totenberg, was married to an ex-senator: Floyd Haskell.\n \n She was married to ex-Senator Floyd Haskell. There's no conflict there, right? She is best friends with Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Nina Totenberg, a reporter at NPR, is best friends with one of the most liberal justices on the court. She's a parent. She has a kid. She's involved with Americans for Democratic Action, and she's a reporter concerned about conflicts? So what should Ginni Thomas do? (excerpts from RUSH)\n \n Yeah, right........what the liberals are telling Ginni Thomas is to sit down, shut up, and get in the kitchen.\n \n They are all running around like stuck pigs. Nothing's going the way it was supposed to go. Health care was supposed to happen last August, if not earlier.",
