Criminals are treated in a worse fashion than others because there are reasons to take away certain rights from them because of their own behavior. Children and severely mentally incapacitated individuals have certain rights taken away from them for their own good - ex. the right to wander around where they please. By the way, this paragraph does not relate to abortion in that I am not saying that fetus' rights should be taken away because of any particular reason relating to what the fetus did. My view is that we give rights to people in the first place because we can relate to and empathize with people and would expect to have those same rights if we were in their shoes.

Check out this website: \n \n http://www.blackgenocide.org/\n \n \n \"Planned Parenthood is the largest abortion provider in America. 78% of their clinics are in minority communities. Blacks make up 12% of the population, but 35% of the abortions in America. Are we being targeted? Isn't that genocide? We are the only minority in America that is on the decline in population.

The founder of Planned Parenthood said, \"Colored people are like human weeds and are to be exterminated.\" Is her vision being fulfilled today?\"\n\n Are you claiming that black women are being forced into abortion? If not, then how is \"genocide\" being committed if they themselves are choosing abortion?\n \n By the way, the rates of abortion in whites vs blacks are similar to the rates of teenage pregnancy between whites and blacks. From http://www.teenpregnancy.org/america/statisticsDisplay.asp?ID=3&sID=20 , there is a roughly three times higher rate of teenage pregnancies among black women than among white women (153/1000 vs 55/1000). From http://www.abortionfacts.com/statistics/race.asp , the abortion rate for whites is 12/1000 while it is 31/1000 for black women. Note, the 1000 refers to 1000 women of child-bearing age (or 1000 teenage women in the case of teenage pregancy rates). Since there is a much higher rate of teenage pregnacny among black women, it makes sense that there would be a much higher rate of abortion among black women. So, the main question is \"Why is there so much more teenage pregnancy among black women?\". I would think that poverty is a main reason. African Americans started off poor because of the legacy of slavery and stayed poor for ages because of unbridled discrimination. The last few decades have produced enormous changes in laws and practices governing discrimination. Unfortunately for African Americans, just as they were gaining more freedoms from discrimination in law and practice, socio-economic changes in the US made it more difficult for anybody who was poor (black or white) to get into the middle class. However, I hope that more African Americans will be able to take more advantage of those opportunities that they do still have to advance to higher levels (in education, sports, etc.).",

That is a topic (who/how decisions of abortion policy) that one can more reasonably argue than whether abortion is moral or not, though it takes more legal and constitutional law knowledge than (at least) I have. I do support a more pragmatic approach to this topic, along the lines of what do we actually need to do about this complex problem. Deciding what is a human or baby or what it feels or thinks is essentially an unanswerable issue. Interesting philosophical arguments to be sure, unless one wants to be dogmatic and insist their own is the only way to see things. \n \n The other issue of what constitutes a \"human right\" legal or constitutionally (or even if such a thing exists in those domains) is also an interesting topic, that I had not considered until now.\n \n Thanks for the clarification.",

   "What are the underlying reasons for that belief? \n \n For me, the underlying reasons for most of my moral belief system are sympathy toward other human beings coupled with an idea that any moral rule needs to be universally applied in its intention. I think that most of us find slavery repulsive because we can sympathize with the suffering of the slave. That is certainly the case for me. \n At a time when slavery was considered ok by most I still believe it was wrong. A majority does not determine what is moral in the absolute sense (although they do enforce it by law...but lets speak outside of that for now). The most basic belief is that others are to be treated with the same respect as myself. I don't think it gets more basic than that...unless you get into where my morals actually derive from. \n \n \nOn a side note, your idea that all people should be treated the same is a nice idea in general but all of us deviate from that when there are reasons to deviate from that. Criminals are treated in a worse fashion than others because there are reasons to take away certain rights from them because of their own behavior.\nPerhaps we have a different definition of equally.\n \n \nChildren and severely mentally incapacitated individuals have certain rights taken away from them for their own good - ex. the right to wander around where they please. By the way, this paragraph does not relate to abortion in that I am not saying that fetus' rights should be taken away because of any particular reason relating to what the fetus did. My view is that we give rights to people in the first place because we can relate to and empathize with people and would expect to have those same rights if we were in their shoes. This is an approach that necessitates a mental existence in the being in question.\nI disagree. I don't mean to imply that equality means we all get exactly the same stuff.",

   "Yes, that makes a lot of sense. That is a topic (who/how decisions of abortion policy) that one can more reasonably argue than whether abortion is moral or not, though it takes more legal and constitutional law knowledge than (at least) I have. I do support a more pragmatic approach to this topic, along the lines of what do we actually need to do about this complex problem. Deciding what is a human or baby or what it feels or thinks is essentially an unanswerable issue. Interesting philosophical arguments to be sure, unless one wants to be dogmatic and insist their own is the only way to see things. \n \n The other issue of what constitutes a \"human right\" legal or constitutionally (or even if such a thing exists in those domains) is also an interesting topic, that I had not considered until now.\n \n Thanks for the clarification.\n\n \n I think the constutionality of the issue is very important as well and perhaps we should make a topic on that. We have before but it always seems like the \"abortion in the constitution\" side dies...this is not to imply they gave up but normally the person arguing doesn't have a good grasp on constituitonal law and history. Sigma argues this sometimes but she doesn't have the time to post often...thus the argument dies right in the middle :(. \n \n TheMoose, would you like Phyllis to start topic on this and perhaps you could learn more about the constitution?

   "first of all, im very sorry that you have not been educated in high school about the statistics, but here you go... this is just one of thousands of sources on the internet that match these numbers... if you really want to see ... google it and find the credible websites.. i dont have time to post 50 for you.\n \n http://www.abortionno.org/Resources/fastfacts.html\n \n \"UNITED STATES\n \n Number of abortions per year: 1.37 Million (1996)\n Number of abortions per day: Approximately 3,700\n \n Why women have abortions\n 1% of all abortions occur because of rape or incest; 6% of abortions occur because of potential health problems regarding either the mother or child, and 93% of all abortions occur for social reasons (i.e. the child is unwanted or inconvenient).\"\n\n \n Don't you hate when people ask for sources and then don't even read it?! That is so annoying. But I definately agree with your source. Statistics have everything to do with what your agrument is about. I have read your link, and it is very accurate. I found not holes in it at all. Actually it is a national average. So it is a worthy source. Please allow me to add to your source, with ones of my own.\n \n Since people still, after a source has been listed. Have doubt, allow me to presnt some more links in conjunction with VTCruiser's links.To fortify the stand. Since this too is my view.\n \n Take a look at this source http://www.PregnantPause.org/numbers/index.html \n \n Here you need to scroll down, and click on,\" why women abort\". There you will see a chart of the reasons. This poll is taken from women who have aborted, and the numbers are from a worty source. Since they are taken from actual women, who have had an abortion. The numbers, match the ones that VTCruiser put up in his first link. 93% of abortions come from women who have social problems. Which in my mind, is not a valid reason for an abortion. BTW only 1.0% of the abortions were from incest, or rape.\n \n Now getting to the point that alot of pro-choice people like to debate upon. They speak of it being cruel to make a woman carry a fetus, when she was raped. They think that this is a special reason why alot of women who have been raped, get abortions. They feel as if, when raped the majority of women have abortions. Well, despite what alot of pro-chioce people want to believe. Alot of women who have been raped do not want abortions. As a matter of fact, they resent any who say they should have one, because they were raped. But I don't want anyone to take my word for it. Lets see what the victims have to say about this.\n \n http://www.lifenews.com/nat2566.html\n \n I do believe the victims are speaking against the abortion of their fetuses, because of rape. And are even taking it to court, to have their voices heard. They are tired of being misrepresented.\n \n Take a look at this. http://www.Amazon.com/victims-victors-Pregnancies-Abortion-Resulting/dp/0964895714\n \n Now this is a book written from about 200 women. Who have been victims of rape. And who have either kept their babies, or regret killing them. Scroll down until you see book description. And read some of their comments on abortion because of rape. \n \n \n What better source to go by then those who have been in the situation?! And I don't doubt that there are some out there who have been raped, and quickly want an abortion. But the majority don't. And like that old phrase says,\" The majority rules!\"",

   "Are you claiming that black women are being forced into abortion? If not, then how is \"genocide\" being committed if they themselves are choosing abortion?\n \n By the way, the rates of abortion in whites vs blacks are similar to the rates of teenage pregnancy between whites and blacks. From http://www.teenpregnancy.org/america/statisticsDisplay.asp?ID=3&sID=20 , there is a roughly three times higher rate of teenage pregnancies among black women than among white women (153/1000 vs 55/1000). From http://www.abortionfacts.com/statistics/race.asp , the abortion rate for whites is 12/1000 while it is 31/1000 for black women. Note, the 1000 refers to 1000 women of child-bearing age (or 1000 teenage women in the case of teenage pregancy rates). Since there is a much higher rate of teenage pregnacny among black women, it makes sense that there would be a much higher rate of abortion among black women. So, the main question is \"Why is there so much more teenage pregnancy among black women?\". I would think that poverty is a main reason. African Americans started off poor because of the legacy of slavery and stayed poor for ages because of unbridled discrimination. The last few decades have produced enormous changes in laws and practices governing discrimination. Unfortunately for African Americans, just as they were gaining more freedoms from discrimination in law and practice, socio-economic changes in the US made it more difficult for anybody who was poor (black or white) to get into the middle class. However, I hope that more African Americans will be able to take more advantage of those opportunities that they do still have to advance to higher levels (in education, sports, etc.).\n\n \n Ok, I'm going to have to question your statement as far as this post goes.\n \n I really don't like the fact that you brought out, how African Americans, abort because of poverty, and low education. But white people abort for different reasons. \n That is basicly what you said. I find that to be an insult. My cousin, was not poor, nor was she uneducated when she had her abortions. As well as my sister. I think that is some kind of rasist idea that alot of people like to keep as regards to black people. Because I never saw you pin a reason, on why white people abort. But in your mind its understandable. But WOE! To the uneducated black folks! Then you go on to state that black people should in fact take advantage of the higher education, and sports provided for them.\n \n By that statement, it seems to me as if you're implying that black people don't take the oppurtunity to benefit ourselves. Need I remind you, that black people are leading in the sports world. And that there are thousands of black people who are taking advantage of higher learning.\n \n And what is your advice for those who are white, who lead uneducated lives, and abort because of being poor. Believe it or not, there are alot in that situation. So don't you dare classify one race. And assume, they are uneducated, and poor. Thus they have abortions. Expecially since I see that with people of all races. It seems to me like you never took that into consideration.",

Indeed, I think that No people - black or white or Asian - take advantage of those opportunities sufficiently, which is part of the reason why this country is far back in its educational attainment compared to other developed countries. Education seems to be the best way for people to advance from a life of poverty to one of middle class status or higher.

Specifically, I openly claim that not enough poor white people are taking advantage of those opportunities offered them through education to reach into the middle classes. Indeed, I think that No people - black or white or Asian - take advantage of those opportunities sufficiently, which is part of the reason why this country is far back in its educational attainment compared to other developed countries. Education seems to be the best way for people to advance from a life of poverty to one of middle class status or higher. What is wrong in advocating that people, of any race, take more advantage of it?\n\n \n I agree that ALL races should take more advantages of the opportunity to advance. But you did not generalize your statements. You classified them to one specific group of people. By making the statement that African Americans should take the opportunity to advance. \n \n But only now are you generalizing your statement. Which tends to lead a reader, like me. To think you were only pin-pointing a certain group of people. Beings that you only said African Americans. You never pin-pointed another race.

   "Firstly, I don't know what procedure you are talking about on that site. Because I was only intrested in the numbers. Not some video, that I don't know whether it is fake or not. I don't pay attention to videos on the internet about abortions. Because I don't know their source, and if they were altered. Also, I don't go to sites with the purpose for the sites to lie, and use deception so that my point can seem right. I like my links to be accurate. I will say this. My numbers added up, to VTCuisers numbers. And his numbers were national average numbers. That shows that whether they come from a pro-life site or not. The numbers are correct. But if the site is what is throwing people off. I will provide numbers from other sources other then a pro-life site, to support my claim. \n\n \n It wasn't a video, it was the methods of abortion \"information\" section of the site. I was just wondering if anyone knew it was correct. \n \n \nAgain, I was not saying the majority rules, in the decision of what other women do with their bodies. I was proving a STATEMENT wrong. Does anyone get it now?! So I'm not saying you have no choice and others deterimne your choice. But the statement that the majority of raped women get abortions is wrong. Only a very few do. That is what I'm stating.\n\n \n I wasn't aware anyone stated that the majority of women who are raped have abortions. I know people have stated that abortion is justified in cases of rape, and it has been mentioned that it isn't the woman's fault to have been raped [in response to those saying the woman should have never had sex].",

   "I know exactly what the example was supposed to be. But the example was uncalled for, and based on an assumption. And I don't take things like that lightly.\n\n \n My experiences with you thus far is that you take little lightly. I use sarcasm to its full benefit. I'm here for fun more than anything. \n \n \nI'm not talking about a while back. I was refering to the sources I put up yesterday. Which you failed to mention yesterday. \n \n\n \n Your sources say the same thing that VTs did and I am not arguing about those stats. I am well aware that few abortions are performed due to rape or critical health conditions. My arguments are with whether rape/critical health conditions are the only valid reasons to abort and with the clumping of millions of women's life experiences into \"social\" or \"convenience\" categories. \n \n \nWell since you quoted yourself on this one. I don't know if you are responding to me or yourself. \n\n \n Just pointing out a previous response I made in regards to the stats.\n \n \nI have already posted up reasons, for why it is not an excuse to abort based on the reasons above. \n\n \n Whoopdedoodaday - I am officially posting here that they are valid excuses.\n \n \nIn another thread. I even put up links, because this has been asked before. And I really don't feel like repeating myself. Also, if you are going to call me preachy, and trival, then why even respond to me?! Your statements will just be the same. To me that is boring. \n\n \n I am not here to entertain you.\n \n You come in here and post stats that claim 93% of abortions are for social or convenience reasons. I take issue with the generalization that everything in a woman's life short of her impending death is a mere \"social\" or \"convenience\" matter. The things I posted are a damned big deal - and need to be addressed (and are only a small offering of the complications that could be going on in a woman's life). What I am saying is that stamping your foot and claiming \"those reasons aren't a good enough reason to get an abortion\" is preachy and does NOTHING. \n \n I am curious as to your goal here. Is it to attempt to reduce abortion or are you just here to state your opinion and attempt to change minds? If it is the latter - preaching is fine, if it is the former - you aren't really going to help. YOU may not think me having to stop working and potentially lose my home or not being able to care for my son aren't good enough reasons to abort - but I may. And if I am the one who is pregnant I will do what I must. You can join me in attempting to find a solution or you can preach. Which do you think will work in stopping the abortion?\n \n \nAlso, you still doubt information that is stated. Like in the case with the rape victims, you said, \"you doubt it, nor do you care.\" \n\n \n You finding one sight of raped women who regret having aborted does not indocate a majority of anything. And I really wouldn't care if you did. I am not arguing that. I never claimed anything about what raped woman want or will prefer. I just want them to have choice. I want me to.\n \n \nI'm not getting mixed up in a debate with someone, who does not want to look at sources, \n\n \n I took a glance and have seen many like them before.\n \n Careful how you condemn - you are being hypocritical again. May I remind you that when I attempted to show you what the world's leading health organizations had to say about gay parenting / gay marriage and what several children of gay parents had to say about their parents you flatly refused to visit the information.\n \n \nand who calls people trival. \n\n \n I did not do this. I said that you were trivializing the life circumstances of 93% of women who are facing unplanned pregnancy. \n \n \nIf you think I'm preachy, stop talking to me.\n\n \n No.\n \n \nThats your choice.

Abortion is a sad symptom of bigger issues. I do believe that it would be wonderful to reduce abortion - but I don't believe criminalization is the answer. And I do believe there are times when abortion may be necesary but only the woman pregnant can know that.\n \n You do not support abortion, but do not seek to stop it either. To me that makes you pro-choice. You think its horrible and even wrong - but you aren't seeking to make choices for other people either.\n \n I have always felt there is more middle ground between the pro-life and pro-choice movement than there is dissent - we all just spend too much time bickering to find it.\n \n For the record - most choicers don't think abortion is grand - it is a sad, hard thing a woman goes through.

   "Margaret Sanger: founder of planned parenthood wrote the following.... \n \n \n \n CHAPTER IV: The Fertility of the Feeble-Minded\n \n What vesture have you woven for my year?\n O Man and Woman who have fashioned it\n Together, is it fine and clean and strong,\n Made in such reverence of holy joy,\n Of such unsullied substance, that your hearts\n Leap with glad awe to see it clothing me,\n The glory of whose nakedness you know?\n \n \"The Song of the Unborn\"\n Amelia Josephine Burr\n \n There is but one practical and feasible program in handling the great\n problem of the feeble-minded. That is, as the best authorities are\n agreed, to prevent the birth of those who would transmit imbecility to\n their descendants. Feeble-mindedness as investigations and statistics\n from every country indicate, is invariably associated with an abnormally\n high rate of fertility. Modern conditions of civilization, as we are\n continually being reminded, furnish the most favorable breeding-ground\n for the mental defective, the XXXXX, the imbecile. \"We protect the\n members of a weak strain,\" says Davenport, \"up to the period of\n reproduction, and then let them free upon the community, and encourage\n them to leave a large progeny of `feeble-minded': which in turn,\n protected from mortality and carefully nurtured up to the reproductive\n period, are again set free to reproduce, and so the stupid work goes on\n of preserving and increasing our socially unfit strains.\"\n \n The philosophy of Birth Control points out that as long as civilized\n communities encourage unrestrained fecundity in the \"normal\" members\n of the population--always of course under the cloak of decency and\n morality--and penalize every attempt to introduce the principle of\n discrimination and responsibility in parenthood, they will be faced with\n the ever-increasing problem of feeble-mindedness, that fertile parent\n of degeneracy, crime, and pauperism. Small as the percentage of the\n imbecile and half-witted may seem in comparison with the normal members\n of the community, it should always be remembered that feeble-mindedness\n is not an unrelated expression of modern civilization. Its roots strike\n deep into the social fabric. Modern studies indicate that insanity,\n epilepsy, criminality, prostitution, pauperism, and mental defect, are\n all organically bound up together and that the least intelligent and the\n thoroughly degenerate classes in every community are the most prolific.\n Feeble-mindedness in one generation becomes pauperism or insanity in the\n next. There is every indication that feeble-mindedness in its protean\n forms is on the increase, that it has leaped the barriers, and that\n there is truly, as some of the scientific eugenists have pointed out, a\n feeble-minded peril to future generations--unless the feeble-minded are\n prevented from reproducing their kind. To meet this emergency is the\n immediate and peremptory duty of every State and of all communities.\n \n The curious situation has come about that while our statesmen are\n busy upon their propaganda of \"repopulation,\" and are encouraging the\n production of large families, they are ignoring the exigent problem of\n the elimination of the feeble-minded. In this, however, the politicians\n are at one with the traditions of a civilization which, with its\n charities and philanthropies, has propped up the defective and\n degenerate and relieved them of the burdens borne by the healthy\n sections of the community, thus enabling them more easily and more\n numerously to propagate their kind. \"With the very highest motives,\"\n declares Dr. Walter E. Fernald, \"modern philanthropic efforts often tend\n to foster and increase the growth of defect in the community.... The only\n feeble-minded persons who now receive any official consideration are\n those who have already become dependent or delinquent, many of whom have\n already become parents. We lock the barn-door after the horse is stolen.\n We now have state commissions for controlling the gipsy-moth and\n the boll weevil, the foot-and-mouth disease, and for protecting the\n shell-fish and wild game, but we have no commission which even attempts\n to modify or to control the vast moral and economic forces represented\n by the feeble-minded persons at large in the community.\"\n \n How the feeble-minded and their always numerous progeny run the gamut\n of police, alms-houses, courts, penal institutions, \"charities and\n corrections,\" tramp shelters, lying-in hospitals, and relief afforded by\n privately endowed religious and social agencies, is shown in any\n number of reports and studies of family histories. We find cases of\n feeble-mindedness and mental defect in the reports on infant mortality\n referred to in a previous chapter, as well as in other reports published\n by the United States government. Here is a typical case showing the\n astonishing ability to \"increase and multiply,\" organically bound up\n with delinquency and defect of various types:\n \n \"The parents of a feeble-minded girl, twenty years of age, who was\n committed to the Kansas State Industrial Farm on a vagrancy charge,\n lived in a thickly populated Negro district which was reported by\n the police to be the headquarters for the criminal element of the\n surrounding State.... The mother married at fourteen, and her first\n child was born at fifteen. In rapid succession she gave birth to sixteen\n live-born children and had one miscarriage. The first child, a girl,\n married but separated from her husband.... The fourth, fifth and sixth,\n all girls, died in infancy or early childhood. The seventh, a girl,\n remarried after the death of her husband, from whom she had been\n separated. The eighth, a boy who early in life began to exhibit criminal\n tendencies, was in prison for highway robbery and burglary. The ninth, a\n girl, normal mentally, was in quarantine at the Kansas State Industrial\n Farm at the time this study was made; she had lived with a man as\n his common-law wife, and had also been arrested several times for\n soliciting. The tenth, a boy, was involved in several delinquencies when\n young and was sent to the detention-house but did not remain there\n long. The eleventh, a boy... at the age of seventeen was sentenced to the\n penitentiary for twenty years on a charge of first-degree robbery; after\n serving a portion of his time, he was paroled, and later was shot and\n killed in a fight. The twelfth, a boy, was at fifteen years of age\n implicated in a murder and sent to the industrial school, but escaped\n from there on a bicycle which he had stolen; at eighteen, he was shot\n and killed by a woman. The thirteenth child, feeble-minded, is the girl\n of the study. The fourteenth, a boy was considered by police to be the\n best member of the family; his mother reported him to be much slower\n mentally than his sister just mentioned; he had been arrested several\n times. Once, he was held in the detention-home and once sent to the\n State Industrial school; at other times, he was placed on probation.\n The fifteenth, a girl sixteen years old, has for a long time had a bad\n reputation. Subsequent to the commitment of her sister to the Kansas\n State Industrial Farm, she was arrested on a charge of vagrancy, found\n to by syphilitic, and quarantined in a state other than Kansas. At the\n time of her arrest, she stated that prostitution was her occupation.\n The last child was a boy of thirteen years whose history was not\n secured....\"(1)\n \n The notorious fecundity of feeble-minded women is emphasized in studies\n and investigations of the problem, coming from all countries. \"The\n feeble-minded woman is twice as prolific as the normal one.\" Sir James\n Crichton-Browne speaks of the great numbers of feeble-minded girls,\n wholly unfit to become mothers, who return to the work-house year after\n year to bear children, \"many of whom happily die, but some of whom\n survive to recruit our idiot establishments and to repeat their mothers'\n performances.\" Tredgold points out that the number of children born to\n the feeble-minded is abnormally high. Feeble-minded women \"constitute\n a permanent menace to the race and one which becomes serious at a time\n when the decline of the birth-rate is... unmistakable.\" Dr. Tredgold\n points out that \"the average number of children born in a family is\n four,\" whereas in these degenerate families, we find an average of 7.3 to\n each. Out of this total only a little more than ONE-THIRD--456 out of\n a total of 1,269 children--can be considered profitable members of the\n community, and that, be it remembered, at the parents' valuation.\n \n Another significant point is the number of mentally defective children\n who survive. \"Out of the total number of 526 mentally affected persons\n in the 150 families, there are 245 in the present generation--an\n unusually large survival.\"(2)\n \n Speaking for Bradford, England, Dr. Helen U. Campbell touches another\n significant and interesting point usually neglected by the advocates of\n mothers' pensions, milk-stations, and maternity-education programs.\n \n \"We are also confronted with the problem of the actually mentally\n deficient, of the more or less feeble-minded, and the deranged,\n epileptic... or otherwise mentally abnormal mother,\" writes this\n authority. \"The `bad mothering' of these cases is quite unimprovable\n at an infant welfare center, and a very definite if not relatively very\n large percentage of our infants are suffering severely as a result of\n dependence upon such `mothering.\"'(3)\n \n Thus we are brought face to face with another problem of infant\n mortality. Are we to check the infant mortality rate among the\n feeble-minded and aid the unfortunate offspring to grow up, a menace to\n the civilized community even when not actually certifiable as mentally\n defective or not obviously imbecile?\n \n Other figures and studies indicate the close relationship between\n feeble-mindedness and the spread of venereal scourges. We are informed\n that in Michigan, 75 per cent. of the prostitute class is infected with\n some form of venereal disease, and that 75 per cent. of the infected\n are mentally defective,--XXXXXX, imbeciles, or \"border-line\" cases\n most dangerous to the community at large. At least 25 per cent. of the\n inmates of our prisons, according to Dr. Fernald, are mentally defective\n and belong either to the feeble-minded or to the defective-delinquent\n class. Nearly 50 per cent. of the girls sent to reformatories are\n mental defectives. To-day, society treats feeble-minded or \"defective\n delinquent\" men or women as \"criminals,\" sentences them to prison or\n reformatory for a \"term,\" and then releases them at the expiration\n of their sentences. They are usually at liberty just long enough to\n reproduce their kind, and then they return again and again to prison.\n The truth of this statement is evident from the extremely large\n proportion in institutions of neglected and dependent children, who are\n the feeble-minded offspring of such feeble-minded parents.\n \n Confronted with these shocking truths about the menace of\n feeble-mindedness to the race, a menace acute because of the unceasing\n and unrestrained fertility of such defectives, we are apt to become the\n victims of a \"wild panic for instant action.\" There is no occasion for\n hysterical, ill-considered action, specialists tell us. They direct our\n attention to another phase of the problem, that of the so-called \"good\n feeble-minded.\" We are informed that imbecility, in itself, is not\n synonymous with badness. If it is fostered in a \"suitable environment,\"\n it may express itself in terms of good citizenship and useful\n occupation. It may thus be transmuted into a docile, tractable, and\n peaceable element of the community. The XXXXX and the feeble-minded,\n thus protected, so we are assured, may even marry some brighter member\n of the community, and thus lessen the chances of procreating another\n generation of imbeciles. We read further that some of our doctors\n believe that \"in our social scale, there is a place for the good\n feeble-minded.\"\n \n In such a reckless and thoughtless differentiation between the \"bad\"\n and the \"good\" feeble-minded, we find new evidence of the conventional\n middle-class bias that also finds expression among some of the\n eugenists. We do not object to feeble-mindedness simply because it\n leads to immorality and criminality; nor can we approve of it when it\n expresses itself in docility, submissiveness and obedience. We object\n because both are burdens and dangers to the intelligence of the\n community. As a matter of fact, there is sufficient evidence to lead us\n to believe that the so-called \"borderline cases\" are a greater menace\n than the out-and-out \"defective delinquents\" who can be supervised,\n controlled and prevented from procreating their kind. The advent of the\n Binet-Simon and similar psychological tests indicates that the mental\n defective who is glib and plausible, bright looking and attractive, but\n with a mental vision of seven, eight or nine years, may not merely lower\n the whole level of intelligence in a school or in a society, but may\n be encouraged by church and state to increase and multiply until he\n dominates and gives the prevailing \"color\"--culturally speaking--to an\n entire community.\n \n The presence in the public schools of the mentally defective children\n of men and women who should never have been parents is a problem that\n is becoming more and more difficult, and is one of the chief reasons for\n lower educational standards. As one of the greatest living authorities\n on the subject, Dr. A. Tredgold, has pointed out,(4) this has created\n a destructive conflict of purpose. \"In the case of children with a low\n intellectual capacity, much of the education at present provided is\n for all practical purposes a complete waste of time, money and\n patience.... On the other hand, for children of high intellectual\n capacity, our present system does not go far enough. I believe that\n much innate potentiality remains undeveloped, even amongst the working\n classes, owing to the absence of opportunity for higher education, to\n the disadvantage of the nation. In consequence of these fundamental\n differences, the catchword `equality of opportunity' is meaningless\n and mere claptrap in the absence of any equality to respond to such\n opportunity. What is wanted is not equality of opportunity, but\n education adapted to individual potentiality; and if the time and money\n now spent in the fruitless attempt to make silk-purses out of sows'\n ears, were devoted to the higher education of children of good natural\n capacity, it would contribute enormously to national efficiency.\"\n \n In a much more complex manner than has been recognized even by students\n of this problem, the destiny and the progress of civilization and of\n human expression has been hindered and held back by this burden of the\n imbecile and the XXXXX. While we may admire the patience and the deep\n human sympathy with which the great specialists in feeble-mindedness\n have expressed the hope of drying up the sources of this evil or of\n rendering it harmless, we should not permit sympathy or sentimentality\n to blind us to the fact that health and vitality and human growth\n likewise need cultivation. \"A LAISSER FAIRE policy,\" writes one\n investigator, \"simply allows the social sore to spread. And a quasi\n LAISSER FAIRE policy wherein we allow the defective to commit crime\n and then interfere and imprison him, wherein we grant the defective the\n personal liberty to do as he pleases, until he pleases to descend to a\n plane of living below the animal level, and try to care for a few of his\n descendants who are so helpless that they can no longer exercise that\n personal liberty to do as they please,\"--such a policy increases and\n multiplies the dangers of the over-fertile feeble-minded.(5)\n \n The Mental Survey of the State of Oregon recently published by the\n United States Health Service, sets an excellent example and should be\n followed by every state in the Union and every civilized country as\n well. It is greatly to the credit of the Western State that it is one of\n the first officially to recognize the primary importance of this problem\n and to realize that facts, no matter how fatal to self-satisfaction,\n must be faced. This survey, authorized by the state legislature, and\n carried out by the University of Oregon, in collaboration with Dr. C.\n L. Carlisle of the Public Health service, aided by a large number of\n volunteers, shows that only a small percentage of mental defectives and\n XXXXXX are in the care of institutions. The rest are widely scattered\n and their condition unknown or neglected. They are docile and\n submissive, they do not attract attention to themselves as do the\n criminal delinquents and the insane. Nevertheless, it is estimated that\n they number no less than 75,000 men, women, and children, out of a total\n population of 783,000, or about ten per cent. Oregon, it is thought, is\n no exception to other states. Yet under our present conditions, these\n people are actually encouraged to increase and multiply and replenish\n the earth.\n \n Concerning the importance of the Oregon survey, we may quote Surgeon\n General H. C. Cumming: \"the prevention and correction of mental\n defectives is one of the great public health problems of to-day. It\n enters into many phases of our work and its influence continually crops\n up unexpectedly. For instance, work of the Public Health Service in\n connection with juvenile courts shows that a marked proportion of\n juvenile delinquency is traceable to some degree of mental deficiency\n in the offender. For years Public Health officials have concerned\n themselves only with the disorders of physical health; but now they are\n realizing the significance of mental health also. The work in Oregon\n constitutes the first state-wide survey which even begins to disclose\n the enormous drain on a state, caused by mental defects. One of the\n objects of the work was to obtain for the people of Oregon an idea\n of the problem that confronted them and the heavy annual loss, both\n economic and industrial, that it entailed. Another was to enable the\n legislators to devise a program that would stop much of the loss,\n restore to health and bring to lives of industrial usefulness, many of\n those now down and out, and above all, to save hundreds of children from\n growing up to lives of misery.\"\n \n It will be interesting to see how many of our State Legislatures have\n the intelligence and the courage to follow in the footsteps of Oregon in\n this respect. Nothing could more effectually stimulate discussion, and\n awaken intelligence as to the extravagance and cost to the community of\n our present codes of traditional morality. But we should make sure\n in all such surveys, that mental defect is not concealed even in such\n dignified bodies as state legislatures and among those leaders who are\n urging men and women to reckless and irresponsible procreation.\n \n I have touched upon these various aspects of the complex problem of the\n feeble-minded, and the menace of the XXXXX to human society, not merely\n for the purpose of reiterating that it is one of the greatest and most\n difficult social problems of modern times, demanding an immediate, stern\n and definite policy, but because it illustrates the actual harvest of\n reliance upon traditional morality, upon the biblical injunction to\n increase and multiply, a policy still taught by politician, priest\n and militarist. Motherhood has been held universally sacred; yet, as\n Bouchacourt pointed out, \"to-day, the dregs of the human species, the\n blind, the deaf-mute, the degenerate, the nervous, the vicious, the\n idiotic, the imbecile, the cretins and the epileptics--are better\n protected than pregnant women.\" The syphilitic, the irresponsible, the\n feeble-minded are encouraged to breed unhindered, while all the powerful\n forces of tradition, of custom, or prejudice, have bolstered up the\n desperate effort to block the inevitable influence of true civilization\n in spreading the principles of independence, self-reliance,\n discrimination and foresight upon which the great practice of\n intelligent parenthood is based.\n \n To-day we are confronted by the results of this official policy. There\n is no escaping it; there is no explaining it away. Surely it is an\n amazing and discouraging phenomenon that the very governments that have\n seen fit to interfere in practically every phase of the normal citizen's\n life, dare not attempt to restrain, either by force or persuasion, the\n XXXXX and the imbecile from producing his large family of feeble-minded\n offspring.\n \n In my own experience, I recall vividly the case of a feeble-minded girl\n who every year, for a long period, received the expert attention of a\n great specialist in one of the best-known maternity hospitals of New\n York City. The great obstetrician, for the benefit of interns and\n medical students, performed each year a Caesarian operation upon this\n unfortunate creature to bring into the world her defective, and, in\n one case at least, her syphilitic, infant. \"Nelly\" was then sent to a\n special room and placed under the care of a day nurse and a night nurse,\n with extra and special nourishment provided. Each year she returned to\n the hospital. Such cases are not exceptions; any experienced doctor or\n nurse can recount similar stories. In the interest of medical science\n this practice may be justified. I am not criticising it from that\n point of view. I realize as well as the most conservative moralist that\n humanity requires that healthy members of the race should make certain\n sacrifices to preserve from death those unfortunates who are born with\n hereditary taints. But there is a point at which philanthropy may become\n positively dysgenic, when charity is converted into injustice to the\n self-supporting citizen, into positive injury to the future of the race.\n Such a point, it seems obvious, is reached when the incurably defective\n are permitted to procreate and thus increase their numbers.\n \n The problem of the dependent, delinquent and defective elements in\n modern society, we must repeat, cannot be minimized because of their\n alleged small numerical proportion to the rest of the population. The\n proportion seems small only because we accustom ourselves to the habit\n of looking upon feeble-mindedness as a separate and distinct calamity to\n the race, as a chance phenomenon unrelated to the sexual and biological\n customs not only condoned but even encouraged by our so-called\n civilization. The actual dangers can only be fully realized when we have\n acquired definite information concerning the financial and cultural cost\n of these classes to the community, when we become fully cognizant of the\n burden of the imbecile upon the whole human race; when we see the funds\n that should be available for human development, for scientific, artistic\n and philosophic research, being diverted annually, by hundreds of\n millions of dollars, to the care and segregation of men, women, and\n children who never should have been born. The advocate of Birth Control\n realizes as well as all intelligent thinkers the dangers of interfering\n with personal liberty. Our whole philosophy is, in fact, based upon\n the fundamental assumption that man is a self-conscious, self-governing\n creature, that he should not be treated as a domestic animal; that he\n must be left free, at least within certain wide limits, to follow his\n own wishes in the matter of mating and in the procreation of children.\n Nor do we believe that the community could or should send to the\n lethal chamber the defective progeny resulting from irresponsible and\n unintelligent breeding.\n \n But modern society, which has respected the personal liberty of the\n individual only in regard to the unrestricted and irresponsible bringing\n into the world of filth and poverty an overcrowding procession of\n infants foredoomed to death or hereditable disease, is now confronted\n with the problem of protecting itself and its future generations\n against the inevitable consequences of this long-practised policy of\n LAISSER-FAIRE.\n \n The emergency problem of segregation and sterilization must be faced\n immediately. Every feeble-minded girl or woman of the hereditary\n type, especially of the XXXXX class, should be segregated during the\n reproductive period. Otherwise, she is almost certain to bear imbecile\n children, who in turn are just as certain to breed other defectives. The\n male defectives are no less dangerous. Segregation carried out for one\n or two generations would give us only partial control of the problem.\n Moreover, when we realize that each feeble-minded person is a potential\n source of an endless progeny of defect, we prefer the policy of\n immediate sterilization, of making sure that parenthood is absolutely\n prohibited to the feeble-minded.\n \n This, I say, is an emergency measure. But how are we to prevent the\n repetition in the future of a new harvest of imbecility, the recurrence\n of new generations of XXXXXX and defectives, as the logical and\n inevitable consequence of the universal application of the traditional\n and widely approved command to increase and multiply?\n \n At the present moment, we are offered three distinct and more or less\n mutually exclusive policies by which civilization may hope to protect\n itself and the generations of the future from the allied dangers of\n imbecility, defect and delinquency. No one can understand the necessity\n for Birth control education without a complete comprehension of the\n dangers, the inadequacies, or the limitations of the present attempts at\n control, or the proposed programs for social reconstruction and racial\n regeneration. It is, therefore, necessary to interpret and criticize\n the three programs offered to meet our emergency. These may be briefly\n summarized as follows:\n \n (1) Philanthropy and Charity: This is the present and traditional method\n of meeting the problems of human defect and dependence, of poverty and\n delinquency. It is emotional, altruistic, at best ameliorative, aiming\n to meet the individual situation as it arises and presents itself. Its\n effect in practise is seldom, if ever, truly preventive. Concerned\n with symptoms, with the allaying of acute and catastrophic miseries, it\n cannot, if it would, strike at the radical causes of social misery. At\n its worst, it is sentimental and paternalistic.\n \n (2) Marxian Socialism: This may be considered typical of many widely\n varying schemes of more or less revolutionary social reconstruction,\n emphasizing the primary importance of environment, education, equal\n opportunity, and health, in the elimination of the conditions (i. e.\n capitalistic control of industry) which have resulted in biological\n chaos and human waste.

   "Fair enough. Preach on.\n\n \n I sure will.\n \n \n \n \nI see unplanned pregnancy and all that leads to it as a problem. I am for all kinds pro-active and re-active measures. Abortion is a sad symptom of bigger issues. I do believe that it would be wonderful to reduce abortion - but I don't believe criminalization is the answer. And I do believe there are times when abortion may be necesary but only the woman pregnant can know that.\n\n \n I also see it as a problem. But I know I'm strictly pro-life. \n \n \nYou do not support abortion, but do not seek to stop it either. To me that makes you pro-choice. You think its horrible and even wrong - but you aren't seeking to make choices for other people either.\n\n \n I'm by no means pro-choice. I view potential of a fetus as more important, then the womans choice. People don't like it, but thats the way I feel. Also, you mentioned that you wwouldn't want to see abortion banned. Well I would not be oppossed to it if it happened. I would not mind if it was banned. I'm just not going to sit up here and keep pushing the issue. I don't care to make choices for others, but I'm not oppossed to seeing abortion banned. \n \n \nI have always felt there is more middle ground between the pro-life and pro-choice movement than there is dissent - we all just spend too much time bickering to find it.\n\n \n I do believe you're right.\n \n \nFor the record - most choicers don't think abortion is grand - it is a sad, hard thing a woman goes through. We just don't want it criminalized - made illegal.\n\n \n I thought it was the other way around. I thought you guys did not mind aborion. I never knew that some of you didn't like abortion since you pro-choice people, are always arguing us pro-life people down as far as abortion goes. \n \n \nIn the end - choicers aren't saying that all rape victims want abortion anyway. They are just saying that they want all rape victims to have the choice.\n\n \n Some of the statements that I've heard.

What level of nutrition was available to those persons in that \"headquarters for the criminal element\"?\n \n \n\"The parents of a feeble-minded girl, twenty years of age, who was committed to the Kansas State Industrial Farm on a vagrancy charge, lived in a thickly populated Negro district which was reported by the police to be the headquarters for the criminal element of the\n surrounding State....\n\n \n \n \n\"The mother married at fourteen, and her first child was born at fifteen.

   "Another opinion", 
   "Regarding what Margaret Sanger did or did not say, some of your biased sites claim she said that African Americans are like weeds while the Planned Parenthood site (arguably also biased) claims that such claims are false and that various passages and books were falsely credited to her. I could take the trouble to try to do a more full search myself to look into this but I would find it, personally, of negligible interest and priority. Why? Because it REALLY DOES NOT MATTER for today's policies and directions. \n \n Look, Thomas Jefferson made an extraordinary contribution to our Democracy BUT he owned slaves and had an illegitimate child with one. Does that mean that we discredit all the good that he did because of the bad? No. We appreciate the good while disparaging the bad. The bad that he did - i.e. in having a relationship with his black slave - should be disparaged but it did not have any long term effect so it is of much lesser import. The legacy of Thomas Jefferson which exists today is the one which had the longer lasting effect - i.e. his contributions to Democracy. \n \n Similarly, on a different level, Margaret Sanger was a supporter of Eugenics - which nearly everyone is against today, including myself and the great majority of pro-choice supporters. However, the Eugenics movement never gained strong power and has no legacies which continue to this day. Also, whether or not she did make disparaging comments about blacks, those comments have nothing to do with the efforts of Planned Parenthood today, so why do you find them of such importance. She may have had her negative sides that should be disparaged (just like the negative sides of anyone who has made positive contributions). However, I do strongly appreciate her contributions toward contraception for women.\n \n Are you claiming that Planned Parenthood or any such organization encourages Eugenic practices against African Americans today? If so, then where is your evidence?",
