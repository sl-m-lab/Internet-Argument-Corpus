   "My knowledge of this is very sketchy but what I piece together it starts off from asexual reproduction (one organism creating another) that in reverse, two coming together to form one, and the system gets slowly and steadily more complex. I know I really didn't answer you question but thats the most I know other than to say it kinda works. Ok I'm going to shut up now after I have exposed my own total ignorance.",

   "Go to the bookstore or library and get the following book:\n The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature\n \n It is quite clear that maximus has a very incomplete concept of evolution. Sex existed long before there were any humans. Sex did not evolve in humans but existed in our ancestors and their ancestors and their ancestors. There is evidence that plants and animals had developed sex more than 500 million years ago.\n \n Although the answer to the question of \"why sex?\" isn't known with certainty, there are some ideas about it. You can read about them in the book above. The leading hypothesis is that sexual reproduction is a means of shedding paracites and also a means to develop resistance to them.",

   "Exchanging DNA is good as it creates a greater oppertunity for beneficial mutations to be passed on much faster than pure mitosis. Early sex is going to be more like a few bacteria do today - kill everything around you and assimilate bits of their DNA or via phages accidently copying section of host DNA into themselves and then passing them on.\n \n After a while the bacteria develop a way of injecting DNA into each other and the exchange of DNA becomes common, spreading fast.\n \n Eventually as organisms get more complex it suddenly becomes advantageous to produce the bare minimum gamete you can (as it lets you create more chances for your DNA to meet a partner as less resources are being devoted to each individual one - they are taking advantage of their unevolved fellows). As this trend continues another strategy emerges, to devoute a large amount of resources to be able to cope with any of the smaller gametes fusing with you (rather than pumping as many smallish gametes out and hoping you find a gamete large enough to form a viable zygote, especially when you have been busy selecting yourself for smaller and smaller gametes). Both strategies are beneficial in the extreme, whilst something in the middle in not a advantage (too small to cope with half the gametes, and not numerous enough to find the large ones).\n \n This goes on you have just selected two sexs. Now bare in mind that one of the varients has to devote a lot of resources to just one gamete at a time (or along those lines) compared to hundreds, you start to get sexual dimorphism based off advantageous behaviour and new phenotypically advantages).\n \n \n Few gaps (there is probably spores in there somewhere between proper haploid gametes and the pure exchange of DNA buts it gets complicated the more details you get into), but its the simplified version that gives you the vague idea how it could develop.\n Bacteria do have sex even though they are very different from what we think of as male and female (one receives new DNA, other has a 'injector' to put it in the other- ok not that different but they can switch and the actual processes are totally different other than in general prinicple, think they alternate it other generations to reduce inbreeding)\n \n Human XY business is all due to where the sex determining sections are and is more recent that the fundamentals of sex (its the other way round in birds I think, some fish have it our way, others don't have sex chromosomes at all) and is based on the fact a the homozygous chromosome appears a lot more than the one with the sex determining factor on it. Genes on the (human) female chromosome, X, replicate faster if it can get rid of the Y gene as its not as essential and there are ways round the mess this causes (i.e not having to become haploid). Y genes benefit by losing as much of the excess sequence on the chromosome that the X might use to recognise and use to target with its anti Y chromosome things. Right now, Y is about as small as it can get and so is no longer really selected against, not entirely sure but I think once it reachs a certain size there is a reasonable chance (well in billions or so or whatever) that the sex determining factors end up on another chromosome and the whole things starts again (hence the erractic system of sex determination) \n Its not a definite theory but it is a possibility, though how widely accepted I'm not sure",
