The people he listens to will tell him the same. So the ones who will get the benefit of tolerance are the ones here who, I am guessing have a better life than they did in their country of birth. So really this is not a question of doing something to bring understanding, there are a dozen ways I can think of that are better than shoving a meaningless inflammatory project down the throats of Americans. How does building a Mosque 2 blocks from ground zero bring about understanding? How many Americans will be going there to learn about Islam?

What guarantee are there that radical anti American propaganda will not be distributed or taught?

NYC is not where the Muslims who wish to act contrary to the Qu'ran and become terrorists live. They are not the uneducated victims of religious fanatics who are happy to send people to their death taking as many infidels as they can with them. The people who need this mosque or community center the most will only see it as a victory for Islam in the war against the Great Satan. That the symbol of American corruption and greed has been replaced by a magnificent symbol of Islam. Who will explain no it is just the US being tolerant of others opinions?

Definitely close enough to serve a community without upsetting everybody but a small minority of that community. If they want to show solidarity and create mutual understanding between the different cultures this is one of the worst ways to do it. \n \n Sharia law isn't about tolerance it's about conversion.

   "So what if they did? They can stand out on the sidewalk and do it now if they wanted to. \n\n \n If they want to stand on a milk crate and read from the Qu'ran all day here is some water and sunscreen read aloud until you have no voice left. That is their right and they are welcome to it. What I was pointing out was an attempt was made to distinguish a Mosque from a Community Center. Not a big deal, but call it what it is. \n \n Looking at it in context they say they wish to foster understanding and reconciliation between cultures. They say they want to bring healing and promote an environment of peace. Is this the way to do that? Are they accomplishing that by establishing a mosque 2 blocks from where religious extremists killed 3,000 people? \n \n The head of the group that wants to build has a book out, where he has changed the name, in which he doesn't discuss those things, but why America is to blame for 9/11 and terrorism. Again he can do so free speech is a right.\n \n Will they be teaching people about how to integrate their Islamic faith into American culture? No there is an established pattern of setting up and setting precedent to legally inserting Sharia law as what govern them. As I said the Muslims here are not the problem. The Muslims here are not taught to blow themselves up and take as many infidels as they can with them. The Muslims here are not the illiterate victims of religious zealots out to overthrow the American government. The Muslims here are not the ones who need this. The head of this group does not condemn terrorism. He believes America is at fault for 9/11 and other acts perpetrated against it. His mission statement is concerns establishing Sharia law. There is no meeting in the middle in such matters. Sharia law, unlike Christian or even Judaism, which I am neither and don't support either, conflicts drastically in some cases with American law mostly with ironically, equal rights.\n \n So add it all up and sorry I see a potential problem. If the Klan wanted to set up next to the Church in Birmingham that was burned in 1963 to bring peace do you think it would work? How about a Pol Pot cultrural center next to the Vietnam Memororial? They could but you have to question the motives for doing something like that. Where the actions don't fit the words. \n \n \n \nRecently in California they disallowed a Christian group on a college campus (as a recognized organization) because the group wanted to follow exactly what they teach (in other words they didn't allow a gay leader). Under your level of thinking this is perfectly fine. \n\n \n Wow talk about a spin. You know perfectly well that this is not what happened. The group was not given access to public funds because they were not open to all members of the public. They were allowed to continue as a club, they just had to pay for it themselves. So is it fair to say under your level of thinking it is ok to discriminate because of your religion. Minorities should be happy to work hard, pay taxes so they can support organizations that think they don't deserve the same rights as everybody else, is that it? But I am the bigot here emoticon_xgood\n \n \nReligion is a fundamental level of thinking for people meaning they derive their entire life around it.\n \n \n Great not a problem, enjoy your beliefs from the comfort of your own home or take it to your place of worship. Your spoiled by the tolerance that our Constitution and culture force upon religion, but religion by virtue of what it is is not tolerant. To each there is one God and you either believe that or you are wrong. For some the response to non belief is I am sorry to hear that and nothing more the flip side of that is the extremes we see presently and throughout history. I have no problem with freedom of religion, as long as it remains free for all religions and those who are not religious. Sharia law is not one of those.\n \n \nThis is the reason is a specific right in the constitution right up there with being able to speak your mind. I'm not about to take any of those principals away from people because I have bigoted thoughts about a certain religion. \n\n \n This isn't about something so simple as a Mosque. If it was there would be an outcry against the hundreds of others being built around the country. A huge one in San Diego for example, not a word didn't make the worthy news even with all this. The problem is who is involved, what their motivation is, where it is being built, why it is being built and what will be the result. Free speech doesn't let you yell fire in a movie theater, it doesn't allow you to undermine the American government, together with religion doesn't give you double the right to discriminate against others. We don't stop Christians who let their children die waiting for God to heal them, but we do prosecute them when those children are denied medical care.

And no it was leadership and members, but let's go your route it's ok to discriminate (which the court actually said was ok) as long as you claim it is because God doesn't approve of someone. Or you can belong but your not worthy of holding a leadership position. \n \n They were more than welcome to exclude whoever they wanted, they just would have to pay their own expenses. \n \n \nThe point here is that in both cases people are trying to control what others do with their own interests. I find that to be a problem.\n\n \n Yes and no. To a certain degree that happens all the time, that is what laws do, that is what taxes do, that is what contracts do, behavior is controlled all the time. We have a fairly broad set of boundaries, but we have them. Sometimes the attempts to control behavior are to prevent certain types of behavior and that means somebody is not going to be able to do something they want to do. Why do zoning laws restrict the type of business that can be opened in certain areas. Try opening an oil change shop on Rodeo and Brighton Way in Beverly Hills, ain't going to happen. \n \n \n \nNo this isn't even true. If this guy was doing it in San Diego, as you say, than no one would care about the motivation or who this guy is. \n \n The real thing is where it is being built. Frankly this doesn't make much sense to me. Can you tell me what the limit is? Would 5 blocks be ok? Being close to a location where people of the same religion committed a criminal act doesn't seem like a strong argument to deny people use of their property to me.\n\n \n \n \nIt doesn't let you yell fire but it does let you undermine the American Government. In fact political speech was the biggest reason for having the amendment. \n\n \n The Supreme Court has ruled inciting criminal activity and sedition among several others is not protected under the 1st. You can criticize the government, you can point out their mistakes, you can talk of removing officials, but not overthrowing it, rebellion etc\n \n \n \nAnd to date this guy has done none of those.\n\n \n Actually he has, but not yet to the point where he would be successfully prosecuted. \n \n \n \nThere is no law this guy is violating and there is no illegal disorder yet created. Not only that, this is an accuse. You would have no problem if this would be elsewhere so stop pretending like what he believes or says matters. \n\n \n Your 100% wrong. I have gone to his website and the organizations he belongs to I have read their mission statements now and before they changed them. I have not read his book, but he did also change the name of that. I have read what these groups are doing and that is why I don't believe what he says about why he is doing it and what he hopes to accomplish. He will not seriously run afoul of the law and will play victim for public support because that is the only way the US will fall, from within. I doubt it will be in my lifetime, but I do not doubt that I will live to see the beginnings of a dramatic change in our society. It may turn out for the best it may not, but this is one of those things that you ask how did I miss that after the fact.\n \n \n \nYou're right...let me rephrase. \n \n I think it is damaging if people start coming up with arbitrary rules that go against our very founding principals. In a way this was done with the constitution by judges and I do not think it should be continued by the general public here.\n \n\n \n I agree for the most part. Maybe it is just embarrassment that the hijackers might have a memorial on the site before the victims do.\n \n \nOne, we aren't in Europe. Two, I'm referring to something like denying Joe's Porn Shop while allowing Dan's Porn Shop. This is basically what you argue. You would allow some religious venues to be there but not all.\n\n \n I meant to compare specialty shops in Europe to our generic shops here. It is a very fine line dealing with religion, especially one that we are not that familiar with. Almost every religion accepts tolerance if it has to, but many don't think their religion might be right or their God is ok with the worship of false Gods by the unbeliever. I don't advocate shutting religion down, unless it crosses that line that causes harm to others or attempts to restrict the freedom of others. Where that line is I couldn't say and when I do I have no idea if others will agree, but it is there somewhere\n \n \nOf course it is sensitive and it is probably irresponsible of the people building it there. That said, I'm not about to say you can't build it there because it may hurt someone's feelings (there is a limitation to this assuming someone is about to call me out on being a hypocrite from the gay rights forum). It just isn't a good or wise action to start denying people property rights like you suggest. Surely that isn't hard to understand either.\n\n \n I am expressing my 1st amendment right to complain and my dislike, I get to do that. Just as they if obey all the laws get to build their building and if they like can put a picture memorial of the hijackers with the words heroes and in loving memory in neon lights on all 4 sides of it. Not going to accomplish any of what they say they want to, but they can",

Say fees earned vs. state and/or federal money and then another for gifts and another income from investments or intelluctural property etc. \nFrom what I understand the real question was the money (something like under $50) and use of facilities most likely in a student union building. Now that building was probably paid for by a combination of state appropriations/state bonds/ and student fees. Hard to say really. Nevertheless, if a school let an outside group use it they normally charge a fee and it goes into a fund for student organizations...often times whats called an agency fund. Not only that but it is almost the same as not allowing a group to march in a public park because they discriminate. There isn't any special burden caused to the state for having a group meet in there. \n \n As for the accounting, my specialty, you bet they keep money separate. Governments run off what is called \"fund accounting\". Universities operate the same way because of the need to spend certain monies a certain way. For example bond money can only be used for construction of buildings, typically, so you have a \"fund\" called \"proceeds from bond for building X\" (to keep it simple). You'll have one for student financial aid, tuition, student fees, athletic fees, agency money, donations, endowments, etc. Whenever you hear that \"jobs created\" number, that is possible because governments set up funds for ARRA projects and can track them separate. \n \n Anywho, so basically they do separate the money and did so with the student fees. \n \n \nUltimately the point is not a penny of public money can be used for discimination.\nWell public money is used for discrimination all the time. Affirmative action is a great example of this. I just don't think this is public money and I don't think it is discrimination. For example if you have a competitive bowling club and you say you have to bowl over a certain threshold to be in the club than shouldn't they be allowed to do this? Student fee money is collected for distribution in the manner in which the students want to be benefited. Those bowling students actually already paid money. Ideally you would just use that money but it is easily to collect it all and disburse it as needed to benefit the entire student body.\n \n \nFor me at least I don't think it is a good idea for it to be built there, not by him and I think his reasons are not honest.

I just happen to think the people arguing against it don't have a good enough reason in my book. I hope you understand this is opinion and I'm not suggesting anything on legal grounds. This just kinda reminds me of small towns who don't want a Wal-Mart. They yell all these reasons and then it doesn't get built and it goes in a town over so everyone from the first town have to drive further now but still go to the Wal-Mart :)...wait, what are we talking about againemoticon_xclown",
