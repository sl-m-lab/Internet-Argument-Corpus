   "I was shocked and saddened when I read the news of terrorist attacks in London. These blasts are barbaric acts against innocent citizens. And the people in all countries are praying for Londoners now. But simultaneously I'd stress these acts of terror again and again remind us that all countries must work together to overcome the terror threat. Although we haven't got any official information about the organizers of the terrorist attacks in London yet, but I flatter myself that they were not foreigners. They are home-grown British. Of course, the method - simultaneous attacks - is a very typical for al-Qaida tactics. But it is also typical for any Islamic radical groups that lately have very often found refuge in UK. It's enough to remind you that central office of well-known Islamic extremist organization, Hizb-ut-Tahrir is officially located in London. And this organization, which enlists as terrorist one in most countries in the world, continues its open activity in UK. So there is no surprise for me that such bloodiest attacks have taken place in London now and that UK authorities have been in a hurry to announce this was the work of some unknown al-Qaida group. It seems to me Americans put it into Blair's head to call its group \"Secret Organization Group of al-Qaida of Jihad Organization\"... Poor Londoners! They've paid too dear a price for the policy of drift of their powers, which are playing double game.",
