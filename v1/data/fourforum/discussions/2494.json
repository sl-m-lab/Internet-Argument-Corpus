   "Those of us who have been involved in the prolife movement for any length of time know how frustrating it can be to get churches mobilized in any kind of formal and organized way in defense of the preborn.\n \n The process of mobilizing a church begins, in most cases, with the church's pastor. If the pastor is unsupportive, it's unlikely the church will be supportive. I know from much personal experience that there are thousands of pastors who claim to be prolife, yet they are noticeably nervous when I ask them to work with me in organizing a Life Appreciation Sunday, or join us for the Life Chain, or participate in any active way in defense of the preborn. \n \n When pressed on the matter, the conversation inevitably turns to the pastor's fear of jeopardizing his church's tax-exempt status. \n \n The Rev. D. James Kennedy has stated:\n \n \"The federal government has proved a tremendous impediment to the ongoing work of Christians. In all the laws that they have passed against Christian schools, gagging the church, taxation, and all kinds of things that they have done, they have made it harder for the church to exercise its prerogatives and to preach the gospel. \n \n \"Take the last presidential election. There were numbers of things that I knew that I was never able to say from the pulpit because if you advance the cause of one candidate or impede the cause of the other you can lose your tax exemption. That would have been disastrous not only for the church, but for our school and our seminary, everything. So you are gagged. You cannot do that. The IRS, a branch of our government, has succeeded in gagging Christians.\"\n \n Dr. Kennedy is right, but he's also blaming the wrong party. The IRS has never required any church to be 501c3. \n \n The IRS' own publications plainly state that all church are \"automatically tax-exempt and tax-deductible\" without ever having to apply for 501c3 recognition. \n \n Not only is 501c3 status unnecessary for any church, when a church becomes a 501c3 they place themselves under the regulatory control of the IRS, and all the potential threat and intimidation that comes along with it. Why would any thinking pastor want that, when it's not at all necessary? It just doesn't make sense.\n \n Thankfully, there's a remedy. Churches can stop \"rendering unto Caesar\" those things which belong exclusively to Jesus Christ. For some insight on the issue you might want to check out: http://501c3.hushmoney.org",

   "I wouldn't have thought there would be any law stopping a church from preaching to it's own congregation. But that isn't what we are talking about is it?\n \n I think Sigma is on to something. If churches want to preach beyond their congregation, then I don't see any reason why they shouldn't be supporting the wider community by paying taxes.\n \n But I don't really think tax is the real issue here. While the church provides a voice for its congregation, it does not speak for every member of our community. \n \n There are many rights at stake in this issue, and the church is powerful enough, not to require further protection. After all, it is the government that enacts laws based on a community's opinion, not the church. Any erosion of this distinction cannot be tolerated.",
