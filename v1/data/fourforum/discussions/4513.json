   "Saw a link to this pamphlet on a bolg and checked it out. It was distibuted to homes and businesses on Wisconsin. I am sorry I would be really freaked if someone came to my door and wanted to hand me this brochure.\n \n http://www.wcuweb.com/Documents/WCULITERATURE/truth.htm\n \n \n The claims about the Nazi's being homosexuals is really out there. If you read to the bottom and look at the reference list you of course see the Name Paul Cameron . What a surpirse that was to find. This isn't very christian if you ask me, luck may have it that most people don't want homosexuality to be criminal. I am just amaed at the lies that are in this brochure, some of which are just outragous claims.\n -Comparing gays to serial killers?\n -Some Nazi death camp survivors have estimated that up to 20% of the guards were homosexuals?\n -Those legislators who are truly \"conservative\" or especially Christian should be working to recriminalize homosexual acts.?\n \n Wow, even the most anti-gay posters I have met on this board wouldn't condone this site and it's wild claims.",

Clearly, many individual Christians, particularly the religious (as in member of orders, not as in pious -- though they were that, too), also did much to thwart the Nazis. \n\n \n Also what was up with Hitler's whole search for the Holy Grail? \n \n * film of the Nazi expeditions across the world, from the Baltic to Venezuela; \n * footage of the 1938 expedition to Tibet, with the measuring of skulls of Tibetans; \n * documentary evidence for expeditions to Peru, Iceland and Iran, and footage of SS chief Heinrich Himmler at archaeological sites.\n \n Didn't Himmler build a mosuleum for the Grail? Or something like that? \n \n I forget exactly now. \n \n But recall something about how Hitler was attempting to redefine Christianity into his own vision with Germany being the dominant influence in a \"new World order.\" \n \n I sort of recall a poster done in Germany that depicted Hitler as a Knight Templar. A crusader of a sort. \n \n \nOn the other hand, though there is evidence that some figures in the Reich were homosexual (or bisexual), Hitler never sought to associate Naziism with homosexuality or homosexual organizations and, in fact, used their records to arrest gay people and destroyed the organizations.\n\n \n Let us not forget that it was from this time period, as well as Hitler's goal to destroy Gays as well as Jews, first utilized the pink triangle to identify gays within the camps. (similarly as with the jews and the use of two yellow triangles, one on top the other to form a star of David, meant to identify Jews.)\n \n \n \nAs for using Hitler to make Christianity look bad, well, very few segments of German/Austrian/Italian/etc society escaped WWII without a deep stain. Christian churches, including the RCC, are no exception.\n\n \n Well no, not with all the publicity photos of Hitler buddying up to RCC higherachy, photos of Bishops raising their arms in Nazi salute to Hitler. Not to mention the RCC flat out denial of what was occuring within the camps.",
