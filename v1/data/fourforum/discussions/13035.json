   "[QUOTE]\nTotally untrue. If you look at systems where VAT is imposed, it raises the proportion of income going on taxation for the poor and reduces it for the rich\n.\n \n Wrong. The fair tax has a 'pre-bate' already built into it indexed to the poverty level. People will get a payment, at the Beginning of each month, that covers tax for the basics \n \n\n How can you claim they would pay no tax when you want to tax everything they buy?\n\n \n Are you being deliberately dense? When you buy something today, in the store, the price of that product already has all the taxes that were paid to produce that product embedded in the cost! The average is about 22%. The fair tax takes that out and replaces it with a sales tax. Because the current embedded taxes will come out (corp. tax, payroll etc...) and because they will be getting a Prebate check, the Fair Tax is the ONLY system that will eliminate taxes on the poor.\n \n \nAs for causing a boom, sales taxes reduce the free flow of goods, people need to make more profit in order to sell at a given price, so money doesn't work as hard going around the economy. It actually slows economic growth. You want to promote growth? Tax uninvested capital and unearned income.\n\n \n Ha! Firstly, we've discussed how much tax is already embedded in a product. Again, that will come out. Secondly, people will have much more money in their pockets because they won't be paying withholding, etc.. taxes. Thirdly, our products will be that much cheaper in the international market and that will spur domestic manufacturing growth. Finally, two things. There is about $13 TRILLION in American money in tax shelters internationally. If even half of that came home (since there wouldn't be any tax on working capital) think of the stimulus. Also by eliminating the corp. tax, tons of jobs will come back home (not to mention the foreign companies that will relocate to the US).",

I posted a graph of the data, kinda hard to spin that.\n \n \n \nFor people on lower incomes, the monthly bill for health insurance premiums is not affordable.\n \n They must choose whether to eat or pay rent or pay for health insurance.\n \n I know this for a fact because, as a woman of a certain age, I have always experienced economic discrimination and have always been low income and I know what it is like to have to live on a low income.\n\n \n Well, they get food stamps for their food and Medicaid for medicine and go to the emergency room for the sniffles. And what, if anything, should anyone be responsible for? Aren't we going to expect anyone to show any interest in their own welfare?\n \n \nBush's right wing governance discouraged knowledge of science and medicine and has created a generation of scientific imbeciles who don't know any thing about healthy nutrition and how to be healthy in general.\n \n Kids are encouraged to become addicted to watching TV and to believe all the stupid fast food ads they see on the boob tube.\n\n \n Bush tricked people into eating McDonald's every meal or smoke crack or drink everyday? Did they erase people's knowledge about anything discovered before 2001 pertaining to Nutrition, Health, or Responsibility? Besides, if the Govt. is responsible for everyone becoming impoverished, fat, addicts, how is them taking over healthcare going to make anyone better?\n \n \nAgain, scientific and medical ignorance. Americans are allowed to be proud of the fact that it's ok for them to be stupid and nonintellectual. George W. Bush played the stupid ignorant fool to perfection and Americans lapped it up\n\n \n So all of America's health problems and issues happened in the last 8 years? Come on. If you can't answer something, just say so. But responding with something like that is beneath you.\n \n \n \n\n Note that Bush and company cut taxes enormously and ran the economy of our country and a huge number of small businesses into the ground.\n \n A lot of government money has been wasted on health care provided by business entities which are inefficient in delivering health care.\n\n \n A business with a bottom line is less efficient than the government?\n \n \nNote that our pharmaceuticals are far more expensive in this country than they are in Canada because we have been forbidden to cut a more favorable deal for the American people by a contract made between Bush's administration and the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n \n What are the profit margins of the pharmaceutical companies in the US? And where are the great advances in Drugs comming from? The countries with govt. controlled drug companies? What giant breakthroughs in medicine came out of the USSR? Or are coming out of China? Or even France or Spain?\n \n \nTry taking on a corporation and its high-powered staff of attorneys.\n \n If you have a problem with government services, contact your senators and congressional representative. These people are your public servants, you vote for them, you pay their salaries, they are supposed to serve your interests.\n\n \n First off, a business that hurts its customers won't be in business for long. But either way, its not possible to sue the govt. in many cases. Furthermore, do you think its easier to get the federal govt. to respond to you than a company that must earn the money you give it? The elected officials are interested only in your vote not your welfare.\n \n \nKings, queens, millionaires, the ultra rich. Of course, the high-priced end of medical care is better in the US.\n\n \n What about the huge amount of people that come from Canada on a regular business? And I think its telling that people who can, would come here rather than getting the \"free\" care in their own country. I'm not sure we want to dumb down care here.\n \n \nDo you see Joe the Plumber from Canada crossing the border over here if he doesn't have a wheelbarrow filled with money?\n\n \n Then how do people without a wheelbarrow full of money get treatment here. And yes, many people come who are middle class.\n \n \nYou're certainly not going to find that info on the so-called \"mainstream\" media which is controlled by the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries.\n\n \n All the commercials I see are about the evil insurance companies, the great healthcare plan, and how people are using scare tactics to trick the public on not liking the healthcare plan. These are REAL COMMERCIALS... some of which I saw on Fox News Channel no less.",

   "And to reiterate...the treatment/scorn shown for anyone who questions the healthcare plan is deplorable. People don't even understand the plan (hell, the lawmakers haven't even read it) and they have a right to question or protest their govt. for ANY reason. Its like some of the leaders have forgotten that this is AMERICA! Just a few short months since Bush and the supporters of the party in power have already forgotten how much they enjoyed their right to protest. Incredible!",
