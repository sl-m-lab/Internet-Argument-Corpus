   "\"How the mind works...is still a mystery. We understand the hardware, but we don't have a clue about the operating system.\"\n \n --- James Watson, co-discoverer of the DNA molecule\n \n \n \n Do humans have an operating system, a code for consciousness similar to the computer's 01 binary code?\n \n Someone has claimed to have discovered a \"master meme\", the king of all ideas, which they have called OS 012.\n \n Is there any merit in having an idea which everybody can agree on? Could it be the start of a new wave of futuristic language and conflict resolution?\n \n The essence of it is this:\n \n 0=Mystery\n 1=True\n 2=False\n \n OS 012 \n \n \n Is this guy insane?
