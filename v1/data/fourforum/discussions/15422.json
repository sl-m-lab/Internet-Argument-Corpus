   "Street Prophets: Faith and Politics\n \n \"Dear Conservative Americans,\n \n The years have not been kind to you. I grew up in a profoundly Republican home, so I can remember when you wore a very different face than the one we see now. You've lost me and you've lost most of America. Because I believe having responsible choices is important to democracy, I'd like to give you some advice and an invitation.\n \n First, the invitation: Come back to us.........................................\"\n \n (full letter viewed at the site) and trust me, it's worth reading the entire letter.-poet",
