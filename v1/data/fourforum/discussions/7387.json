   "France's Chirac Issues Nuclear Warning. \n \nPresident Jacques Chirac warned Thursday that France could respond with nuclear weapons against any state-sponsored terrorist attack, broadening the terms of French deterrence to adapt to new threats.\n \n The warning came as France works with other Western nations to ensure that Iran does not become a nuclear power, but officials and experts said Chirac's comments were not aimed specifically at Iran.\n \n \"Nuclear deterrence ... is not aimed at dissuading fanatic terrorists,\" Chirac said in a speech delivered at a nuclear submarine base in western France.\n \n \"Leaders of states who would use terrorist means against us, just like anyone who would envisage using, in one way or another, arms of mass destruction, must understand that they would expose themselves to a firm and fitting response from us,\" he said. \"This response could be conventional. It could also be of another nature.\"\nA marvelous display of French Exceptionalism: rules for others don't apply to us. One can only wonder how Chirac would have responded if Bush had made this threat first.",

   "Saddam and the terrorists.\n http://www.nationalreview.com\n \n When President Bush stated that \"we've had no evidence that Saddam Hussein was involved with the September 11th\" attacks, his critics quickly spun this into \"Saddam Hussein had no links to terrorism.\" This was despite the fact that in the same breath the president had said, \"there's no question that Saddam Hussein had al Qaeda ties.\" According to Editor & Publisher, the story got little play, though it is certain to come back to haunt the president during the election campaign when Democrats seek to wedge the Iraq and al Qaeda issues. Thus, it is useful to review the bidding on the known facts of the relationship between the two. While it is still debatable to what degree Saddam Hussein supported the global terrorist network, it is becoming increasingly clear that Iraq provided terror groups with some forms of logistical, intelligence, transportation, training, weapons, and other support. The emerging evidence points to the conclusion that al Qaeda had a cooperative relationship ? that is, a strategic alliance ? with Iraq. The conventional wisdom has been that this could not have been the case because bin Laden, an Islamic fanatic reactionary, and Saddam, a secular Baathist modernizer, could never align or cooperate. On a personal level, they probably hated each other. If intelligence analysts approach their task with the premise that a relationship could not exist, they will lack the analytical framework necessary to piece together the clues that could demonstrate that it did. Maybe an Elvis Presley/Richard Nixon-type photo of the two would convince them, but not much else.\n \n INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS 101\n But the premise is facile. The principle that drove Iraq and al Qaeda together is one of the oldest in international-relations theory ? the enemy of my enemy is my friend. The motive for their alliance was a common hatred for the United States and Israel. Ideology seldom determines wartime-alliance structures, and for both Saddam and Osama the 1990s were wartime. The Iraq/al Qaeda combination is as reasonable as the temporary strategic alliance between the U.S. and the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany, or Syrian and American troops fighting side by side during Operation Desert Storm. (Note that it is hard to distinguish Syria from Iraq ideologically, and Baathist solidarity was certainly not a motivating factor in the relationship between the two countries.) Moreover, despite their personal dislike for each other, Saddam Hussein was the only state leader openly to praise bin Laden's attacks on the U.S. (if not bin Laden himself).\n \n Saddam Hussein showed no reluctance to support terrorism per se during his career. The fact that he gave money to the families of Palestinian suicide terrorists and had a close working relationship with the PLO was well known, and something he admitted. The Iraqi regime maintained a terrorist training camp at Salman Pak near Baghdad where foreign terrorists were instructed in methods of taking over commercial aircraft using weapons no more sophisticated than knives (interesting thought that). Saddam also harbored Abu Nidal and other members of his international terror organization (ANO) in Baghdad. Abu Nidal died under suspicious circumstances in Baghdad in August 2002, an apparent multiple gunshot suicide. Abd-al-Rahman Isa, ANO's second in command based in Amman, Jordan, was kidnapped September 11, 2002, and has not been heard from since. Coalition forces did recently apprehend ANO member Khala Khadr al-Salahat, the man who reputedly made the bomb for the Libyans that brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. He was hiding out in Baghdad. Another bomb maker, Abdul Rahman Yasin, was also a Baghdad resident. He was one of the conspirators in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing who had fled there after being detained briefly by the FBI. Recent document finds in Tikrit show that Iraq supplied Yasin with both money and sanctuary. The 1993 WTC attack was masterminded by Yasin's associate Ramzi Yousef, who received financial support from al Qaeda through Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a key 9/11 planner.\n \n There is also the case of Abu Zubayr, an officer in Saddam's secret police who was also the ringleader of an al Qaeda cell in Morocco. He attended the September 5, 2001 meeting in Spain with other al Qaeda operatives, including Ramzi Bin-al-Shibh, the 9/11 financial chief. Abu Zubayr was apprehended in May, 2002, while putting together a plot to mount suicide attacks on U.S. ships passing through the straits of Gibraltar. He has allegedly since stated that Iraq trained and supplied chemical weapons to al Qaeda. In the fall of 2001 al Qaeda refugees from Afghanistan took refuge in northern Iraq until they were driven out by Coalition forces, and Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, an al Qaeda terrorist active in Europe and North Africa, fled from Baghdad during Operation Iraqi Freedom. He has reportedly been sent back to Iraq to coordinate al Qaeda activities there.\n \n Iraq made direct payments to the Philippine-based al Qaeda-affiliated Abu Sayyaf group. Hamsiraji Sali, an Abu Sayyaf leader on the U.S. most-wanted terrorist list, stated that his gang received about one million pesos (around $20,000) each year from Iraq, for chemicals to make bombs. The link was substantiated immediately after a bombing in Zamboanga City in October 2002 (in which three people were killed including an American Green Beret), when Abu Sayyaf leaders called up the deputy secretary of the Iraqi embassy in Manila, Husham Hussain. Six days later, the cell phone used to call Hussain was employed as the timer on a bomb set to go off near the Philippine military's Southern Command headquarters. Fortunately, the bomb failed to detonate, and the phone yielded various contact numbers, including Hussain's and Sali's. This evidence, coupled with other intelligence the Philippine government would not release, led to Hussain's expulsion in February 2003. In March, ten Iraqi nationals, some with direct links to al Qaeda, were rounded up in the Philippines and deported as undesirable aliens. In addition, two more consulate officials were expelled for spying.\n \n The most intriguing potential link is reflected in documents found by Toronto Star reporter Mitch Potter in Baghdad in April, 2003. The documents detail direct links between al Qaeda and Saddam's regime dating back at least to 1998, and mention Osama bin Laden by name. The find supports an October 2001 report by William Safire that noted, among other things, a 1998 meeting in Baghdad between al Qaeda #2 Ayman al Zawahiri and Saddam's vice president, Taha Yasin Ramadan. Other reports have alleged bin Laden himself traveled to Iraq around that time, or at least planned to. Former Iraqi ambassador to Turkey, Farouk Hijazi, now in custody, allegedly met with bin Laden before the 9/11 attacks.\n \n THE ATTA CASE\n The alleged meeting between 9/11 team leader Mohammed Atta and Iraqi intelligence agents in Prague, Czech Republic (CR) is a unique case in that the Czechs have been more adamant about proving it than the United States. Interior Minister Stanislav Gross held a press conference on October 26, 2001, revealing the details of the Prague connection. According to Czech police, visa records indicate that Atta visited Prague twice in 2000. His first confirmed visit was while he was in transit from Hamburg to Newark, New Jersey, June 2-3, 2000. The German newspaper Das Bild reported on October 25, 2001 that according to unnamed FBI sources, Atta met with Iraqi diplomat Ahmad Samir al-Ani in a cafe in Prague on June 2. Another report has it that Atta did not leave the airport terminal since he lacked a visa. Later that summer Atta flew back to the CR. He stayed one night in the Prague Hilton, and may have spent a brief period of time in the town of Kutna Hora, 35 miles north of Prague, under the name Mohammed Sayed Ahmed. During his second visit, he allegedly met with Ahmed Hedshani, the former Iraqi ambassador to Turkey.\n \n The more controversial part of the story is the alleged meeting between Atta and al-Ani in the Iraqi embassy in Prague in the spring of 2001. Atta was identified based on photographs published after the 9/11 attacks by an informer who was at the embassy at the time and had met Atta, though said he was \"not 100 percent sure\" it was him. The Czech counterintelligence service (BIS) gives it a 70 percent probability. Al-Ani was expelled from the Czech Republic in April 22, 2001, for \"activities which conflicted with his status.\" He was allegedly plotting an attack on Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), which was also supporting Radio Free Iraq.\n \n But if they met, why? It is unlikely they were discussing the alleged RFE/RL operation, since Atta had more important things to do and the Iraqis did not need his help with that one anyway. They might have been discussing the 9/11 attacks, but there is no evidence to support that claim. The article in Das Bild raised another, more intriguing possibility: The Iraqis were supplying Atta with anthrax spores for use in attacks on the United States. The anthrax attacks had commenced shortly before the article was published, and the idea seemed plausible at the time. In fact, it still does ? the anthrax used in the attacks was weapons grade, the attacks originated from areas near where the hijackers had been active, and two years of investigation have not turned up the presupposed domestic perpetrator. At some point, you would think Occam's Razor would come into play.\n \n The US Justice Department disputes most of the above. Because the US has no independent evidence that the 2001 meeting occurred, and since an examination of INS records published in May 2002 showed no movements corresponding to the Czech timeline, Justice concluded that the meeting could not have taken place. (The report did however show Atta going to Madrid for a week in January 2001, and to Zurich for twelve days in July 2001.) Yet, the Prague meeting came and went in a day or so. If Atta had traveled under an assumed name, a possibility the Justice Department acknowledged, he could have been there and back before anyone noticed. (Iraqi deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz also denied the meetings took place.) The affair has been a matter of contention between the U.S. and CR. Interior Minister Gross, BIS chief Jiri Ruzek, and Jan Klas, chairman of the parliamentary commission overseeing the BIS, have stated that thus far they have seen no evidence to challenge their conclusions. Clearly, the essential person to talk to is al-Ani. He was reportedly apprehended by U.S. forces on July 2, 2003, though where he was caught, where he is now, and what he has had to say about the alleged meetings, are all unanswered questions.\n \n Last June, former CIA Director James Woolsey said that \"there were enough connections [between al Qaeda] and Iraq and Iraqi intelligence that we ought to be looking at this very hard, as we capture files and people and hard disk drives in Iraq and so on, and see what we can turn up.\" There are more open-sourced links than those noted here ? I would refer readers to Appendix A of Richard Miniter's Losing Bin Laden for some more noteworthy incidents and possible evidence of collusion. As I have noted before, Saddam Hussein had means, motive, and opportunity to be involved with global terrorism, and al Qaeda in particular. Much remains to be revealed, and one hopes the administration is compiling a dossier to make the case in detail and beyond doubt. The president has stated that there is no question these ties existed, and it is frustrating that something unquestionable keeps being questioned so persistently.",

I think that the world would let such a defensive move slide, but would look harshly on the use of nukes by the agressor nation.\n \n IMO, going to war with IRan may well cuase just as many problems for the dollar as not. Just on the possibility of a disruption with Iran oil is close to $70 per barrel and the dollar has dropped over 300 pips against almost all other currencies since the first of the year, a move that cannot be traced to purely economic indicators.\n \n The Sauds have already suggested a willingness to change to Euros for oil sales if the dollar fails to stabilize, so this may well be a damned if we do damned if we don't scenario.",

The world cannot and will not allow Iran to become a nuclear tyrant.\n\n \n The IAEA has unfettered access to all Iranian nuclear sites. Additionally, they have cameras at all researcxh and refining facilites, as well as an agreement with Iran for snap inspections pretty much anywhere they wish. They have had go anywhere see anythign access for 2 years now.\n \n What exactly would you suggest as \"proof\" of peacful intentions? After all the inspections, and with all the cameras, the IAEA has nto found one shred of evidence that there is any military aspect to Irans program at all. It is NOT Irans responsibility to prove they are not militarizing their program. It is the IAEAs responsibility to show that they are, since it is nearly impossible to prove from the negative viewpoint. \n \n Do you not see that this is the Iraq game all over again? The inspectors say \"There is nothing there\". The US swears that it IS and by god we have EVIDENCE (that nobody is allowed to see). IT is the same right down to the insistance that the Iranians prove that something does not exist, which is impossible to do. And the US public eating it all up.\n \n Lets look at the realities of the situation for a minute.\n \n Iran is running a heavby water reactor which is more than capable of producing enough plutonium for weapons. Additionally, their heavy water reactor has the ability to act as a breeder reactor, producing even more plutonium.\n \n Iran announced a little over a year ago that they felt that ME oil reserves were massively overstated,a nd that within 15 years there would be a seriosu energy deficit worldwide, and that they planned to be the worlds premier supplier of nuclear fuel. Currently most nuclear fuel comes from the US and the EU. Letting the Iranians start a large fuel program would significnatly impact the fuel sales of those nations.\n \n Iran announced last year that they would be opening a Euro based oil market in 2006. Every OPEC country has singed on to sell there and every European and Asian nation has expressed a willingness to buy there. They expect to pull 20% of oil sales the first year and increase in subsequent years. Besides the direct market loss, consider this. Lets say that the world uses about 30 billion barrels of oil per year, and oil costs $50 per barrel. That is 1.5 trillion in cash changing hands. Now, lets say that the Iranians actually take 20% of that and sell it in Euros instead of dollars. That is 300 billion in the first year. That essentially means 300 billion American dollars that nobody particularly needs, because they are paying Euros, not dollars, for their oil. And that is just the first year. The dollar would fall like a rock, and continue to fall.\n \n So, what do you think is the more likely scenario here? Do you REALLYthink that we are going after a country for uranium enrichment, despite the fact that they have the ability to turn out all thee plutonium they need, and despite the fact that the IAEA has inspected the hell out of them, and has cameras in thir facilites? Or do you thin we aare being lied to AGAIN??",

   "Iran has also declared nuclear weapons to be haram (I think that is the correct term), or forbidden. \nIran has also said chemical and biological weapons are haram. Based on such declaration we can infer there are no such weapons in Iran. The problem is that Iran balks at intrusive inspections that would satisfy the world community. Further, the argument rings hollow that Iran needs nuclear power to ensure their energy needs, as they sit on vast reserves of $70-a-barrel petroleum, and burn off natural gas at the wellhead.\n \n The haram declaration is a hopelessly transparent fa\u00e7ade, since if WMDs are haram, how is it that Iran was caught with a prohibited uranium enrichment program? When IAEA inspectors uncovered the covert activity, Iran had no choice but to argue a strategy of dual use, no matter how implausible that appears to skeptical onlookers. Regardless, getting some turbaned clerics in Qom to declare nuclear weapons haram (prohibited) one day doesn't preclude them from later tearing up that fatwa and declaring such weapons halal (acceptable). \n \n \nIn any case we are not talking about a nuclear armed Iran, as yet, though we are talking about a nuclear armed Israel.\nThat sounds rather backwards. News headlines show there is extensive talk today about a nuclear armed and theocratic Iran and almost no talk about a democratic Israel, where a nuclear weapons capability has existed for 40 years. \n \n \n \nI don't think even the Iranian leadership is going to nuke tel aviv when the response will be 200 Jericho 2 missiles hitting Iran.\nThe ruling clerics hold supreme power, unchecked by the parliament. No one can be sure what the Guradian Council will do if allowed to have nuclear weapons. We can be sure, however, of what they have done in the last two years: lapsing back into extremism, unwinding the reforms of the former moderate president, disqualifying half the candidates in the last election, closing down the free press, torturing journalists, jailing students, executing gays, and so on.\n \n Now comes the country's new president to poke a stick in the eye of any so willing to accord rational thinking to the current regime. Consider Ahmadinejad's view of his speech to the UN General Assembly. Afterwards he was videotaped relating the story of how a light surrounded him during his speech, and that his audience was transfixed as if a hand held them there and made them sit. This Holocaust-denying, genocide-aspiring believer in apocalyptic Muslim prophecy also stated recently that the Islamic Revolution's main mission is to prepare the way for the reappearance of the 12th Imam. Note that the coming of this messianic figure is to be accompanied by unprecedented trials and tribulations, death and destruction. This isn't mere rhetoric, given 1400 years of Shi'a martyrdom, reaching back to Muhammad's son-in-law, Ali, the 1st Imam who was murdered by Muslim zealots. That the mullahs may wish to hasten Armageddon may not be the stretch that you think. Some mullahs say that Iran can and will survive a nuclear exchange with Israel, and that the sacrifice of millions of Muslims in exchange for cleansing Muslim lands of infidels is consistent with the Shi'a tenet of righteous martyrdom.\n \n But even if you're right that the Iranian leadership won't become unhinged, fixating on the threat to Israel is too narrow a focus. A nuclear Iran will trigger a regional arms race, since Arab pride is unlikely to tolerate an exclusive Persian Bomb. Nor will Arab states want their petroleum export policy dictated by Iran. Nor will Europeans, whose capitals are within missile range, want to be vulnerable to shake downs and extortion. Nor will fledgling Mideast democracies want to be bullied by Tehran. Nor will America want tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers from Afghanistan to the Persian Gulf to be targeted. Autocracy, WMDs, and religious extremism is an ominous mix.",

Should Iran desire to industrialise ( ie build up a manufacturing base ) Iran is going to require more of that 2.5 million barrels to stay in Iran to power the factories and electrical power plants.\nYour stats on Iran's oil production and export are accurate. So too the mention of Iran's population and severe unemployment of youth. Your assumption, however, that Iran's domestic consumption can only be increased by reducing oil exports is bogus.\n \n Iran's future oil production is not fixed at current levels. Nor is it wrong to suggest that Iran's stated need for nuclear power is not very compelling, given the immense scope of natural gas they burn off at the wellhead. Indeed, Iran is the world's worst offender of this environmentally destruction behavior, as shown in this bar chart on page 5.\n \n If Iran would reduce its wastage of natural gas at the wellhead to the world average of 2.3%, the economic savings would be equivalent to roughly three of the Bushehr nuclear power plants that Russian is constructing.\n \n If the Iranian leadership were serious about national economic development and providing opportunities for unemployed youth, they would abandon their nuclear aspirations for now. It's simply too costly, compared to the practical alternative of further developing their enormous reserves of indigenous energy resources.\n \n But the country's ruling mullahs simply aren't focused on economic development to assist the nation's youth, or even the middle class for that matter. Look at the economic record of postrevolutionary Iran. It's been a history of steady decline since the ayatollahs came to power. How is it that you cite Iran's current oil production of 4 million bbl/d, yet do not openly wonder how it is that oil production was at 6 million bbl/d in 1979?\n \n Not only is oil production two-thirds of what it was before the revolution, but Iran's per capita income today is just one-third what it was. And what became of the vibrant middle class that use to be? The nation's youth are not the only ones suffering from widespread unemployment, chronic high inflation, and wage stagnation.\n \n Let's be clear. The politically modern president who was elected to office in the late '90s to reverse this dire economic trend is now gone, utterly defeated by his conservative foes who are returning the nation to extremism. The Iranian economic renaissance you allude to will continue to be pipe dream. It appears that as long as the mullahs are in control, business corruption will continue to be rampant, economic reform will remain off the radar, and direct foreign investment will find limited opportunity. \n \n \n \nAs nuclear power is emmissions friendly it makes some economic environmental sense to use nuclear power. Just as the Japanese and French.\nI agree it makes more economic sense than before. My personal view of nuclear power has changed in recent years. I was long a staunch opponent of nuclear power for environmental reasons, dating back to my college years when I majored in wildlife ecology. I've undergone a conversion of sorts due our national appetite for energy and the problems deriving from excessive dependence on petroleum imports.\n \n Here's a January 2006 briefing paper entitled, The Economics of Nuclear Power, from the Uranium Information Center, an Aussie website.\n \n Note the opening bullet: Nuclear power is cost competitive with other forms of electricity generation, except where there is direct access to low-cost fossil fuels.\n \n Still, let's assume for sake of argument that Iran's economic development warrants a need for nuclear power. Then how does one explain Iran's rejection of the EU-Russian proposal to defuse the crisis. No one should doubt that Iran's quest is for nuclear armaments, not power. The question at hand is how should the international community respond.",

Let the chips fall where they may. \n Regardless of who attacks Iran, ME oil supplies will be disrupted. The US now depends on the Sauds for about 14% of oil imports, with Iraq, Indonesia and others contributing 5%. Canada, Mexico and Venezuela provide 41%, with domestic production at 40%. A war against the ME initiated by the US or a US supported Israel, which is what attacking Iraq will produce in a manner which we're now unable to cope with facing only Bin Laden, will disrupt the world economy to a level where our oil requirements will easily be reduced by 20%. We're heading towards a severe domestic economic crisis with or without attacking Iran that will lower our oil consumption. I'd prefer weathering that circumstance with fewer enemies, ongoing Asian credit facilitation, and Iran as a potential nuclear danger who can, if necessary, be quickly eliminated at low cost to my country using our nuclear weapons capability. \n \n Idealistic thought: We have the means to completely eliminate any nation who attacks us; let us shed our fears and concentrate on getting our own country positioned for future growth after becoming a service industry economy adjusts our standard of living and completes the migration to a two-tier society. Driving our economy with internal transactions on a debt basis without legitimate new wealth is eventually fruitless unless we begin attacking nations for immediate booty. A shame that our recent era of great prosperity developed such pathetic, self-serving dual political parties as our sole leadership choice.",

   "Awww, that's easy. For years, France, Germany and Russia were paid off with oil contracts from Saddam if they continually oppose any effort to stop the corruption in the \"Oil for Food\" program that the UN set up. So it was in France's interest to oppose the US taking out Hussein.\n\n \n What a nonsense. This myth is going through internet debates for quite a while, but that does not make it better. It is just wrong. France and russia are in the UN security council and they are among the ones that are responsible for the sanctions against Iraq. So they spoiled there own (alleged) business with Saddam. And opposing the Iraq war to continue business with Saddam would only make sence if you would assume that the US are going to loose it, which nobody did. And btw the \"Oil for food\" program was tiny and simply not worth it. And BUYING Oil is a bad business. To make money you SELL it. Why should the russian BUY oil when they are sitting on enough oil to supply the half world themselves. The (tiny) iraqi oil exports were observed by the UN and the americans. So how should Saddam sell anybody oil without anybody finding out about these deals?\n \n No no, the reasons why these countries opposed the war were different. And they have the right to do so.
