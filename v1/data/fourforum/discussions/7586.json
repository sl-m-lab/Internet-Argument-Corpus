   "If the international world really wants to stop nuclear proliferation in the Middle East they would put pressure on the State of Israel to disarm their nuclear weapons. How can the international community of nations say Iran cannot have nuclear weapons and Israel can? This is the epitome of hypocrisy of the western world that the Arab nations see today. On one hand if an Arab nation violates United Nations Resolutions they are sanctions and or invaded. On the other hand if the State of Israel violates United Nations Resolutions escalating the violence in the region they receive more United States military aid. \n \n Without major changes in United States-Israeli policies and actions in the region there will be no peace or security in the world. The Middle East arms race must end with the State of Israel following the path of Libya and South Africa in dismantling their nuclear weapons. Then and only then could a nuclear free Middle East be a possible reality. Otherwise you can expect more Islamic Middle Eastern nations trying to obtain nuclear weapons one way or another. \n \n The question the Israelis have to answer is for how long do they think they can be the only country in the Middle East with nuclear weapons. The Jewish people of Israel have to learn to become more and better diplomats and less of warriors in their pursuit of peace and security. Never before in world history have so few people gotten so much global attention stirring up so much resentment. \n \n The Israelis and United States have start working with the International community of nations for what is in the best interest of the people of the world. There is no way Israel or the United States could lose if they became more apart of the international community as an equal instead of standing it alone. The security of both nations would greatly improve with their improved relations with more nations around the world. Israel will be much more secured with more fiends than foes in the Middle East. \n \n The chances the State of Israel can remain the only nation in the Middle East with nuclear weapons for very long are slim to none over the course of time. This course will lead to World War III putting the whole world in more danger. On the other hand if Israel dismantled their nuclear weapons the whole world would unite to keep the Middle East nuclear free region. In this case the State of Israel would have new doors opening in the Middle East and around the world making them more secure than ever before. \n \n My Blog http://www.globalcrier.blogspot.com/",
