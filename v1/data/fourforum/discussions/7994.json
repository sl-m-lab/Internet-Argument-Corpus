It has also trimmed its holding of sterling from 11pc to 10pc. The surprise move sent the dollar tumbling to $1.2342, down almost 2pc for the week. It fell to $1.7822 against sterling in New York trading.\n \n Traders were already skittish after warnings from Bundesbank chief Axel Weber that financial markets were at risk of \"significant negative consequences\" from a possible slide in the dollar and a sharp rise in US bond prices as capital inflows dried up.\n \n The Swedish move follows comments over the last month from officials in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar hinting at a partial switch of their dollar-heavy reserves into euros.\n\n \n I have heard on several occasions our current situation regarding dollar hegemony compared to a gamne of high stakes poker where all the participants are just waiting for some sign from the other players. \n \n This is my favorite part of the article...an attempt to put lipstick on a pig if ever I have seen one:\n \n \nSweden's Riksbank denied the switch was a thumbs-down for the dollar, saying it was aimed at ensuring stable reserves by reducing volatile currencies.\n\n \n I got a news flash that gave the entire statement this morning. Unfortunatly it was in my forex trading platforms news window so I have no link, but this is about as slective a paraphrase as I have ever seen. Even this is not all that great. Essentially the happy happy sunshine revised version in the artcle reads \"The swedish say it is not a thumbs down for the dollar....just that the dollar is trash and they don't want it anymore\".\n \n It is time for the economic cheerleaders out there to realize that even the selfless socialists in sweden are tired of loosing 10-20% of their reserve value every year so that Americans can sit on their asses, be non productive, and fight idealogical wars.",
