Is it any wonder that the theory of evolution is under siege, or that many Americans still believe in a link between Iraq and 9/11, when facts and evidence can be dismissed as matters of opinion? \n \n David Silverstone\n New York, June 15, 2005",

   "This is a bit offtrack for the abortion thread but pertains to factual relativism:\n \n We're losing in Iraq\"\n \n \n \n Members of the Bush team may scoff at those of us in the \"reality-based community,\" but even some of their own are beginning to call the administration on its tenuous relationship with the facts on the ground in Iraq. In this week's U.S. News & World Report, Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel -- he would be a Republican -- says it's time for the White House to come to grips with the hard truth about the war: \"The reality,\" he says, \"is that we're losing in Iraq.\" \n \n \"Things aren't getting better; they're getting worse,\" Hagel tells the magazine. \"The White House is completely disconnected from reality. It's like they're just making it up as they go along.\" \n \n Hagel has criticized the administraton's handling of the war before, but his talk of \"losing in Iraq\" represents his harshest assessment yet. His comments come after Vice President Dick Cheney declared that we're seeing \"the last throes\" of the insurgency in Iraq but before 37 Iraqis died in suicide bombings and other attacks Sunday and 20 more were killed Monday -- and before Condoleezza Rice made the rounds of the weekend talk shows to boast of the progress being made in the war. On Fox News Sunday, Rice dismissed the insurgency as \"a few terrorists and so-called insurgents who are plying their wares in a way that gets a lot of attention\" and claimed that the administration is \"making a lot of progress on what is going to be a strategic breakthrough for the United States, which is to have a different kind of Middle East.\" \n \n From Salon's War Room",
