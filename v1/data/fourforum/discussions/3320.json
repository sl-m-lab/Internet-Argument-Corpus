   "I've come across several posts that have various stages of evolution/migration etc stemming from China, not Africa..\n The Chinese are quick to show the prominent role China played in our evolution. There is evidence that we evolved in Africa, or that we evolved elsewhere. http://www.chineseprehistory.org/beard.htm\n \n Thus...\n \"The recent African-origin model championed by many genetic researchers relies on genetic findings that fit just as easily into a contrasting multiregional model. That is, populations of H. sapiens living in different parts of Africa, Asia, and Europe interbred enough over at least the past 1 million years to evolve collectively as a single species. The various populations around the world derived from even older ancestors of H. sapiens in this scenario.\n Practitioners of what has been dubbed anthropological genetics now operate with a sense of caution and a hunger for better explanations of how evolutionary forces produce genetic diversity among individuals and groups.\n \"A lot of us have been too eager to assume that a strict out-of-Africa model is correct because it's compatible with the genetic data, without considering that the data also fit with the multiregional theory,\" says anthropologist John H. Relethford of the State University of New York at Oneonta. \"It's time to go back to the drawing board on this issue.\"\n A fundamental conflict between the two current theories--each of which has several proposed variations on its theme--lies in their differing assumptions about the evolutionary significance of genetic differences among individuals and populations, Relethford asserts. DNA analyses appear unable to determine which perspective proves superior, he says.\"\n http://www.findarticles.com/cf_dls/...1/article.jhtml\n \n Further, today's paper shows this article.\n Family trees share roots in 1415BC\n By Deborah Smith, Science Editor\n October 2, 2004\n The world is a closer-knit place than it seems.\n Everyone alive today is descended from one person who lived about 3500 years ago, probably in Asia, a study has found.\n American researchers created elaborate mathematical models of human migration to come up with this estimate of when our most recent common ancestor existed. \"While we may not all be 'brothers', the models suggest we are all hundredth cousins or so,\" said Joseph Chang, a professor of statistics at Yale University.\n \"No matter the languages we speak or the colour of our skin, we share ancestors who planted rice on the banks of the Yangtze, who first domesticated horses on the steppes of the Ukraine, who hunted giant sloths in the forests of North and South America and who laboured to build the Great Pyramid of Khufu.\"\n The find may seem surprising, but the number of ancestors each person alive has - two parents, four grandparents, 16 great-grandparents, etc - builds up very quickly, until, many generations back, there is a large overlap, the researchers said.\n They carried out different computer simulations of history, tracking the movement and possible interbreeding of all the people who have lived within the past 20,000 years, incorporating factors such as geographical barriers to migration and world events. The results are published in the journal Nature.\n The average date for when the most recent common ancestor lived was 1415BC. And most simulations suggested an East Asian homeland, because this would have allowed the descendants to move quickly into Europe, the Americas, and even the Pacific islands.\n The team noted that if one group of people had been completely isolated until today, then, logically, the common ancestor must have lived before they went into isolation.\n People in Tasmania were one group who may have been completely isolated from mainland Australia from 12,000 years ago until 1803, due to the flooding of Bass Strait. This did not affect the results, because \"today there are no remaining native Tasmanians without some European or mainland Australian ancestry\".\n http://smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/01/1096527941072.html?oneclick=true\n \n DISCLAIMER: I don't support the out-of-china/multi-regional models. But further information can be found at\n http://www.jqjacobs.net/anthro/paleo/multiregional.html",

The article suggests that previous theories were Afro-centric. \"Could it be that the entire story of primate and human evolution was like watching the movie \"Out of Africa\" over and over, with every major transition in primate evolution occurring on that continent?\" Are you using 'ancestral with the spin that ancestor may not be anything other than archaic?\n Or are you suggesting that they arose in China, then moved back to Africa? Because the article says \"Carnegie palaeontologist Chris Beard tells how he made the scientific and political choices governing his selection of fossil research sites, and what it's like to discover a very early rung on the ladder of human evolution.\" Which suggests that they were an actual ancestor.\n By the way, you do the same bwaahhaa as Iamthetruth. An indication of the level of which you wish to 'discuss' things. (Could it be that you have two IDs on this post?). Sorry if that seems ad hominem, but it's less so that your remarks.\n\n History repeats itself :)\n It says clearly...\n \"Carnegie paleontologist Chris Beard tells how he made the scientific and political choices governing his selection of fossil research sites, and what it's like to discover a very early rung on the ladder of human evolution.\"\n http://www.chineseprehistory.org/beard.htm\n But then you're going to end this post not really sure about whether it is, or it isn't another theory on the origins of man.\n \nWhat does an article about the origin of primates some 50 million years ago, which may have been in China, have to do with origin of hominids, which was in Africa some 5 to 7 million years ago. If you wish to claim ancestry, you are free to do so.\n\n Read the words -ladder of early human evolution emphasised above. Then, read the article.\n or go to the links at its parent site (which is devoted to China-centred evolution links)\n http://www.chineseprehistory.org//index.htm.\n It gives heaps of links to multi-regional theories, one states...\n \"..evidence is mounting that the emergence of modern humans during the Late Pleistocene was characterized by a &#8220;multi-causal and complex demographic process&#8221; and &#8220;a complex migration and mixing process, variable degrees of continuity in various regions of the world, and strong ties between eastern and western parts of the Old World&#8221; (Brauer 1992). A similar conclusion was reached from a study of the Yunxian crania, from Hubei province, China (Li and Etler 1992), in which it was noted that, &#8220;the differential distribution of character states associated with H. sapiens in regionally disparate Middle Pleistocene human populations suggests that the events leading to the emergence of modern humans were not restricted to one region of the world alone.\"\n Homo erectus in East Asia: Human Ancestor or Evolutionary Dead-End? Dennis A. Etler Department of Anthropology Cabrillo College, Aptos, California\n http://www.chineseprehistory.org//athena_review.pdf\n Or \"The Retention in East Asia of the diagnostic facial and dental features mentioned above, which are characteristic of all living and fossil Asians, refutes the notion that the transition from H. erectus to premodern H. sapiens in China was due to a simple replacement event...\"\n Etler, D. A. \"The Fossil Evidence for Human Evolution in Asia\"\n http://www.chineseprehistory.org//annualreview.pdf\n \nYet another screwed up link.\n\n Yes, see the note at the bottom of the post.\n \nMy wife tells me that I have no patience with computer illiterates. It seems that it is so. However, the quote doesn't refer to anything that has gone before. I doubt it. There are too many other DNA studies that show that humanity is older than that. But we'll see. Was this study actually published?\n\n It said in Nature. See http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/nature/journal/v431/n7008/abs/nature02842_fs.html\n One mistake such as...\n http://smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/01/1096527941072.html?oneclick=true \n Doesn't equate to illiteracy (if it did, then note the spelling mistakes you make) (ah for only an ounce of insight)\n \nDISCLAIMER: I don't support the out-of-china/multi-regional models. But further information can be found at\n http://www.jqjacobs.net/anthro/paleo/multiregional.html \n\n \nCertainly you don't\n\n Good, that's what I said.\n \nFurther to this there are many variations on the two basic theories\n\n \nSo what? Why do you think that current scientific theories must represent the absolute TROOTH?\n\n It isn't even close. It can't answer how, only that it did.\n \nWhat happens when more data is found that falsifies the TROOTH? Creationists cling to the TROOTH as long as they can, until it becomes so stupid that their elementry (sic) school children begin to question them. Then TROOTH changes.\n\n Obviously it's upsetting to you and Mach because you've done nothing but try and question why I'd post information, as if you're worried about information.\n \nBy the way, Monty. I know a paleoanthropologist who was a member of the team that worked on the Shoshonius cooperi. Do you want me to send you(r) post along for comment?\n\n Who cares?\n \nWould it matter to you if the origin of primates were in china while the origin of hominids was in Africa? Can you actually understand the difference?\n\n Would it matter? Nope. Would your friend know the defence between the word 'human' and 'primate'?\n You seem not to be able to make up your mind, you both accept that it is one of many theories on humans - asking 'so what if it is', but then you also argue that it isn't... hence the 80% of your post that you try to claim it's saying something else.",

   "\"...the theory of evolution does not rely upon any of the mutually exclusive theories as you claim.\"\n \nYes it does.\n\n No it doesn't... yes it does... no it doesn't... yes it does... Where are we going with this? Let's start over, as Mach tried to do:\n \n Evolution: Change in allele frequency in a population over time.\n \n Does evolution rely on different hypotheses about the exact path that humanity took to arrive where it is today? No. Regardless of the path that that modern humans took to get where we are today, the theory of evolution stands. It has been supported by countless observations. Never has there been a valid observation that didn't support the theory of evolution. (Not to say that there won't ever be, but there hasn't been yet. We can reasonably conclude that, given the vast amount of supporting evidence, it is highly unlikely that there ever will be such an observation.)\n \n \nWhen you want to show how evolution happened, such as with the ascent of man, there are several different ideas put forward. They are mutually exclusive (the two I'm aware of), and the one I put forward is one of them. \n\n Okay. I'm with you so far.\n \n \nHow do you think the path-way for man's ascension is described?\n My textbook, when I was studying evolution demonstrated the various stages of man's evolution, including the pathway of the arrival of modern man.\n How did modern man appear? It put forward four schools of thought\n the Unilinear School;\n the Polyphyletic School'\n the Preneanderthal School; and\n the Presapiens School\n Poirier, F E, \"In Search of Ourselves: An Introduction to Physical Anthropology\", p346ff \n These were used to show how evolution in man happened.\n\n Close. They are attempts at explaining the nature of evolution specific to our ancestry.\n \n \nThey are relied upon to show how man evolved.\n\n I think here's where you're starting to lose me. They are not relied upon for anything. They are hypotheses. Attempts to explain observed evidence. When evidence is found that can be used to conclude that a hypothesis is not true, then another hypothesis must be found that fits the existing evidence.\n \n \nAnd they are mutually exclusive.\n\n So what?\n \n \nIf you are going to demonstrate how evolution happened, then you rely on a theory, or in this case, a set of theories.\n\n Incorrect. Explanations of the theory of evolution rely on observed evidence. When observed evidence does not fit the explanation, then that particular explanation cannot be an accurate explanation.\n \n \nI have already acknowledged that since studying this, these four schools have lapsed. HOWEVER, two current theories have emerged, and they are used to show how evolution in man happened, and guess what? They are mutually exclusive too!\n\n Again... so what? What's your point?\n \n \n \nAnd, as I stated, the \"Out of China\" stuff represents ONE OF THOSE THEORIES which is used by, or relied upon to explain   evolution and it is mutually exclusive of the other one relied upon.\n\n So, the \"Out of China\" hypothesis is one attempt at an explanation for how modern man came to be what it is today. Okay. And there are other attempts (some of which are mutually exclusive) at explaining how modern man came to be what it is today. Okay. \n \n So what's your point?\n \n Please note again your incorrect assumption in the above paragraph that I highlighted in bold. Evolution does not rely upon these mutually exclusive explanations. These attempts at specific explanations are, simply put, guesses based on observed data.\n \n \nIF you don't believe evolutionists put forward this theory, then what do they rely on? \n\n Ummm... First of all. I don't think anyone would argue that scientists who recognize the validity of evolutionary theory have put forward the \"Out of China\" hypothesis. Secondly... What does who or what rely on for what? To support evolution? The vast body of evidence that exists that supports evolution. And the lack of evidence that exists that does not support evolution.\n \n \nOr, do you simply dismiss this theory and rely on the Afro-centric one? \n\n They are both attempts at explaining more specifically how we came to be what we are today. Obviously, they cannot both be correct. Perhaps neither of them is an accurate representation of how we came to be where we are today. But so far, both of these hypothesis have evidence that supports them... or else they would be scrapped in favor of another attempt at an explanation that better fits the observed evidence.\n \n Montalban -- What is your attempt at an explanation as to how modern humans came to be what they are today?",

   "Montalban... I just thought of an explanation that may help you understand this concept. Please offer me your thoughts as to what you make of this explanation:\n \n The various, mutually exclusive ideas of the specific nature of the course that evolution took in actual human history in this physical realm are not Theories of Evolution in and of themselves. They should not be confused with evolutionary theory, which states that evolution is the change in allele frequency in a population over time. \n \n Consider it using this analogy for a moment...\n We have an observation that we know to be true. Let's say, for example, in North America, some birds fly south for the winter months. That's been observed countless times, and there can be no real argument that it happens.\n \n Now... let's consider one particular type of bird... say, geese. Or, more specifically, Canadian Honkers. (Out of curiosity, do you have geese in Australia?) Let's explore why geese in particular fly south in the winter. Where and why did that start? What is the motivation? What particular routes do these geese take when they fly?\n \n These are the sorts of questions that can have mutually exclusive explanations. But the question of whether or not the geese actually fly south is unaffected by these mutually exclusive hypotheses. \n \n Certainly, this isn't a perfect analogy. But I'm curious to know whether you see my point in presenting this. Please respond if you are so inclined.",

   "No it doesn't... yes it does... no it doesn't... yes it does... Where are we going with this? Let's start over, as Mach tried to do:\n Evolution: Change in allele frequency in a population over time.\n\n Either you believe this is 'just-so' statement, evident by itself, or you believe that scientists actually put forward ideas to show how evolution happens, using evidences.\n And how is this shown? They use many different models to explain how evolution happened. Evolutionists claim to use observation and models to show how evolution happened. Unless you and Mach believe that I am saying that the process of evolution relies upon mutually exclusive theories, and I'm not saying that. I'm saying the explanation of evolution relies upon a whole range of 'proofs' from observations, various hypotheses and theories, and some of these are mutually exclusive.\n \nDoes evolution rely on different hypotheses about the exact path that humanity took to arrive where it is today? No. Regardless of the path that modern humans took to get where we are today, the theory of evolution stands.\n\n This is it then! It is the ultimate 'just-so' belief. You do a massive discredit to evolutionary theorists who've spent heaps of time and effort in an effort just to show how it did happen. If you just say 'evolution happened' and don't rely on no explanation of 'how', then you have created a massive 'just-so' statement. But scientists endeavour to show evolution has happened. And some of the theories, (interpretations of the evidence), they put forward are mutually exclusive.\n \"Q:I thought evolution was just a theory. Why do you call it a fact?\n A: Biological evolution is a change in the genetic characteristics of a population over time. That this happens is a fact. Biological evolution also refers to the common Adescent of living organisms from shared ancestors. The evidence for historical evolution -- genetic, fossil, anatomical, etc. -- is so overwhelming that it is also considered a fact. The theory of evolution describes the mechanisms that cause evolution. So evolution is both a fact and a theory.\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/faqs-qa.html\n What are these evidences to show that it is a 'fact'? Well some of them point to mutually exclusive theories.\n \nIt has been supported by countless observations. Never has there been a valid observation that didn't support the theory of evolution. (Not to say that there won't ever be, but there hasn't been yet. We can reasonably conclude that, given the vast amount of supporting evidence, it is highly unlikely that there ever will be such an observation.)\n\n AND the evidence points to, in some cases mutually exclusive theories.\n \nWhen you want to show how evolution happened, such as with the ascent of man, there are several different ideas put forward. They are mutually exclusive (the two I'm aware of), and the one I put forward is one of them.\n\n \nOkay. I'm with you so far.\n\n [quote=Montalban]How do you think the path-way for man's ascension is described?\n My textbook, when I was studying evolution demonstrated the various stages of man's evolution, including the pathway of the arrival of modern man.\n How did modern man appear? It put forward four schools of thought\n the Unilinear School;\n the Polyphyletic School'\n the Preneanderthal School; and\n the Presapiens School\n Poirier, F E, &#8220;In Search of Ourselves: An Introduction to Physical Anthropology&#8221;, p346ff \n These were used to show how evolution in man happened. \n [quote=Thebootfitter]Close. They are attempts at explaining the nature of evolution specific to our ancestry.\n That's exactly what I said, they were used to show how man evolved, through a process of evolution. And they are mutually exclusive.\n [quote=Montalban]They are relied upon to show how man evolved.[/quote\n \nI think here's where you're starting to lose me. They are not relied upon for anything. They are hypotheses. Attempts to explain observed evidence. When evidence is found that can be used to conclude that a hypothesis is not true, then another hypothesis must be found that fits the existing evidence.\n\n No, they are relied upon to show how evolution happened. See quote above; 'The evidence for historical evolution is so over-whelming that evolution is considered a fact'.(ibid)\n \nAnd they are mutually exclusive.\n\n \nSo what?\n\n That is a point we can raise on another thread perhaps. If you have no problem with it being a theory that excludes others then you need not debate me here, because all I did was posit on of the mutually exclusive theories that evolution relies upon.\n \nIf you are going to demonstrate how evolution happened, then you rely on a theory, or in this case, a set of theories. \n\n \nIncorrect. Explanations of the theory of evolution rely on observed evidence. When observed evidence does not fit the explanation, then that particular explanation cannot be an accurate explanation.\n\n Not quite. Evidence is 'there'. Scientists use it to demonstrate one hypothesis/theory. Some other group of scientists use it to demonstrate another hypothesis/theory. Regardless, my book showed all four schools as possible.\n On the current theories of the ascent of Man...\n \"The current controversy is largely a reflection of different scientific philosophies, linked to ideas about race through their treatment of variation. But there is more to it. Even if they have no conscious social agenda, scientists are bound by the same preconceptions as everyone else - their social, religious, and educational backgrounds influence their choices of theories and, perhaps more important, their philosophies of science. Karl Popper noted more than once that it doesn't matter where hypotheses come from, only whether they explain the evidence they are based on, wether they are subject to disproof, and whether they can hold up to enthusiastic attempts to disprove them. This philosophy forms the basis of deductive science. But hypothesis do come from somewhere, often the underlying assumptions of society. Moreover, not only the differences in sources of ideas, but also different premises scientists have held about evolution, human nature, God, and how science should be done, have always underscored the controversies about human evolution.\"\n Wolpoff, M & Caspari, R, (1997) \"Race and Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction\", p12.\n \nI have already acknowledged that since studying this, these four schools have lapsed. HOWEVER, two current theories have emerged, and they are used to show how evolution in man happened, and guess what? They are mutually exclusive too! \n\n \nAgain... so what? What's your point?\n\n What's yours?\n I stated why I posted here. I stated at the beginning of this post I was presenting evidence for one of them. I stated the way this thread would 'evolve'. You and Mach seem very upset by me posting stuff on evolution.\n \nAnd, as I stated, the \"Out of China\" stuff represents ONE OF THOSE THEORIES which is used by, or relied upon to explain evolution and it is mutually exclusive of the other one relied upon. \n\n \nSo, the \"Out of China\" hypothesis is one attempt at an explanation for how modern man came to be what it is today. Okay. And there are other attempts (some of which are mutually exclusive) at explaining how modern man came to be what it is today. Okay.\n\n BINGO. Finally. Yes.\n \nSo what's your point?\n\n Egad. If you didn't read through all the posts.\n See post #4 \"I am simply putting these forward for comment\". I believe that many people here would not be aware of the mutl-regional model. Mach and your own dedication to stifling the dissemination of information is remarkable.\n \nPlease note again your incorrect assumption in the above paragraph that I highlighted in bold. Evolution does not rely upon these mutually exclusive explanations. These attempts at specific explanations are, simply put, guesses based on observed data.\n\n Then you are saying you can't show how evolution happened.\n \nIF you don't believe evolutionists put forward this theory, then what do they rely on? \n\n \nUmmm... First of all. I don't think anyone would argue that scientists who recognize the validity of evolutionary theory have put forward the \"Out of China\" hypothesis.\n\n You actually need to read what was in the articles they put forward. I used a 'catch-phrase' title, that seems to be something you've obsessed with. The actual theories are the 'muti-regional' model. This is startling that you would be so dismissive of it without actually demonstrating any rudimentary knowledge of what it is you're dismissing.\n \nSecondly... What does who or what rely on for what? To support evolution? The vast body of evidence that exists that supports evolution. And the lack of evidence that exists that does not support evolution.\n\n So, now we're back to evolution being supported by (I use 'rely upon'; but you and Mach seem to hate that) evidence. What evidences? If I line up a series of skulls and say 'here is the evidence that supports evolution' it would mean nothing. Someone would step forward and say \"We believe it supports evolution because ....blah, blah, blah!\" they construct a theory to interpret the evidence evolution is 'supported by'. But another group step forward, take the same evidence and re-arrange it in another way, still consistent with evolution. Textbooks will teach each is valid. They are mutually exclusive, but they explain how evolution happened. Therefore evolution is supported by mutually exclusive theories.\n \nOr, do you simply dismiss this theory and rely on the Afro-centric one? \n\n \nThey are both attempts at explaining more specifically how we came to be what we are today. Obviously, they cannot both be correct.\n\n Indeed, but they are still used to demonstrate how the evidence supports evolution. Or, you're back to just pointing to a bunch of evidence and saying 'we don't know how it supports evolution, but it does.'\n \nPerhaps neither of them is an accurate representation of how we came to be where we are today. But so far, both of these hypothesis have evidence that supports them... or else they would be scrapped in favor of another attempt at an explanation that better fits the observed evidence.\n\n Yes, I understand that. I presented one of them for discussion and got a bucket of indignation hurled at me for doing so. As I said, so much for discussion about evolution, let's instead debate endlessly wether it's a 'theory' or a 'hypothesis', or \n \nMontalban -- What is your attempt at an explanation as to how modern humans came to be what they are today?\n\n This is again going off topic. As I stated earlier, people already know what I believe. I instead post a bit of information, that I don't happen to agree with to generate discussion. Instead it backfires by a whole group of people who seem deeply upset that I should even desire to do so.\n \n In effect I see your denials to undermine evolutionary theory; ironic. The vast array of evidences 'just' point to evolution. Regardless of the theories used to shape it.\n \n I'd like to continue some more, but I've got to go and vote.",

   "If you have no problem with it being a theory that excludes others then you need not debate me here, because all I did was posit on of the mutually exclusive theories that evolution relies upon.\n\n I appreciate that you post some of the attempted explanations for how we came to be where we are today. Feel free to post as many as you like. There is certainly no shortage of ideas in the wide world we live in.\n \n Point of clarification: \n My motivation is this (nothing more and nothing less) --< I am merely attempting to clarify an inaccurate statement that you made when you said, \"I am simply putting forward for comment one of the mutually exclusive theories that evolution relies upon.\"\n \n And then I said, \"...the theory of evolution does not rely upon any of the mutually exclusive theories as you claim.\"\n \n And then you said, \"Yes it does.\"\n \n The fact that you are putting forward something for comment is irrelevant to my point. The fact that you are claiming that evolution relies upon something other than observed evidence is what I am addressing here.\n \n Now that this is established, I would appreciate your cooperation in resolving this issue with me without introducing other factors into the equation.\n \n Regardless of the topic we are discussing, the principles remain the same... whether it be evolutionary biology, cosmology, gravity, etc. The scientific method, in principle, remains the same. It consists of four main steps (copied here from talkorigins):\n \n 1. Make observations. \n 2. Form a testable, unifying hypothesis to explain these observations. \n 3. Deduce predictions from the hypothesis. \n 4. Search for confirmations of the predictions; if the predictions are contradicted by empirical observation, go back to step (2). \n \n When a particular hypothesis is supported by many observations over and over again, and is not contradicted by any of the observations that have been made over the course of time, it will be regarded as a theory. \"The validity of a hypothesis does not stand or fall based on just a few confirmations or contradictions, but on the totality of the evidence.\"\n \n As we can see from this very simple explanation, a scientific theory depends upon the observations (i.e. the evidence) that support it. If the evidence does not support a hypothesis, it will be either scrapped or modified so that it fits the existing evidence. In no way, shape, or form does any scientific theory depend upon another hypothesis. All the mutually exclusive theories in the world cannot change observed evidence. (However, testing for a particular hypothesis may lead to the discovery evidence that falsifies one hypothesis or another.)\n \n This is not a difficult concept to grasp, but perhaps I am just not adept at explaining it in a manner that communicates to you, Montalban.

No theory relies upon other hypotheses for its validity. A theory relies upon observed data.\n \n \nThis is it then! It is the ultimate 'just-so' belief.\n\n You're not serious, are you?

Otherwise, let's defer to the body of evidence collected over the years that supports evolutionary theory.\n \n \nIf you just say 'evolution happened' and don't rely on no explanation of 'how', then you have created a massive 'just-so' statement.\n\n Here, I must ask for clarification... Are you suggesting that we determine specifically how the frequency of alleles changes in a population over time? I'll defer to a biologist who can explain this fact in detail. Or are you suggesting we determine specifically how modern man came to be what it is today? As is evidenced by the multiple, mutually exclusive theories that exist (some of which you have brought to our attention), I'm not aware that we yet can answer this question. However, given what we know about biological populations from years of observed evidence, there is no current hypothesis that fits the observed evidence - except evolutionary theory, meaning that the genetic characteristics that make up our current population has been changing over time... and the further back we go into history, the more changes that have been observed. \n \n \nBut scientists endeavour to show evolution has happened.\n\n I don't think this is an accurate statement. Almost all scientists recognize that evolution happens. Some of them endeavor to show exactly the route that a particular species took in its evolutionary development.\n \n \nAnd some of the theories, (interpretations of the evidence), they put forward are mutually exclusive.\n\n Why do you continue to stress this irrelevant point?\n \nAnd AND the evidence points to, in some cases mutually exclusive theories.\n\n Here you do it again...\n \n \nNo, they are relied upon to show how evolution happened. See quote above; 'The evidence for historical evolution is so over-whelming that evolution is considered a fact'.(ibid)\n\n The mutually exclusive hypotheses to which you are referring attempt to explain how evolution occurred... the specific route that it took to bring us where we are today. The fact that evolution happens does not depend upon these hypotheses; rather, evolution depends upon the body of evidence that supports it. If any ONE piece of evidence can be shown to contradict the theory of evolution, then it will have to be modified to fit that evidence - or else scrapped in favor of a new theory that does fit the evidence. Given all the tests that evolution has passed to this point in time, it is highly unlikely (though certainly possible) that new evidence will be discovered that refutes evolutionary theory. Rather, as new evidence is discovered, new hypotheses will be developed that better explain the specifics of the evolutionary path that our ancestors took.\n \n \nNot quite. Evidence is 'there'.\n\n Are you claiming here that you know of evidence that refutes evolutionary theory? I find this hard to believe, but if you demonstrate this evidence, I'm all ears!\n \n \nScientists use it to demonstrate one hypothesis/theory. Some other group of scientists use it to demonstrate another hypothesis/theory. Regardless, my book showed all four schools as possible.\n\n You seem to be stuck in this fallacy of thinking that hypothesis in their earlier periods cannot be mutually exclusive without invalidating a different theory. It's okay for hypotheses to be mutually exclusive. Happens all the time. One of them may accurately describe reality. Maybe none of them can explain newly discovered evidence. If that's the case, then a new hypothesis is created. Maybe several new ones. Maybe some of these new ones are also mutually exclusive. One of them may accurately describe reality. Maybe none of them do. This is the way it works. This is the scientific process. Pretty simple.\n \n \nWhat's yours?\n\n If it wasn't clear before, I have attempted to state my point clearly and concisely in my most recent post.\n \n \nYou and Mach seem very upset by me posting stuff on evolution. \n\n I don't get 'upset.' This is a story that you are fabricating in your mind. You can post on evolution all you want. But if you make an inaccurate statement, and I catch it, I'll point it out for the sake of clarification. I'd hope you would do the same for me.\n \n \nMach and your own dedication to stifling the dissemination of information is remarkable. \n\n You are welcome to your opinion. &#61514; Though, I don't believe either one of us has any problem whatsoever with you disseminating valid information. Your claim that a scientific theory relies upon other hypotheses is what both of us are attempting to clarify.\n \n \nThen you are saying you can't show how evolution happened. \n\n If you are asking whether I know the specific evolutionary route that our ancestors took in order to bring us where we are today, you are correct.

   "And what you are saying is not accurate. No theory relies upon other hypotheses for its validity. A theory relies upon observed data.\n\n The data isn't just 'observed'. It is put into a hypothesis, it is used to show how evolution happened. People don't just accept evolution based on a jumble of data that only means itself. The data is used by scientists to create workable theories of how the data fits into the idea of evolution. Or else you are saying that the proof of evolution is just that there's lots of evidence that proves it, surely a circular argument. It is 'how' it proves it that is important.\n No scientist just presents a skull and says \"This is data that proves evolution\". They present the skull and they might say 'this proves evolution because it shows the 'how' of evolution, because it shows a change from one species into another.\" It shows a particular school of thought on how to interpret the evidence. Another scientist, still agreeing with evolution might say that the skull fits somewhere else in the scheme of things, and propose another school of thought. \n \nThis is it then! It is the ultimate 'just-so' belief.\n\n \nYou&#8217;re not serious, are you? Are you aware of one single observation that contradicts evolutionary theory? If so, please share it. Otherwise, let&#8217;s defer to the body of evidence collected over the years that supports evolutionary theory.\n\n So in effect you belief people observe evolution happening, and don't try to demonstrate 'how', somehow it is just observed happening?\n How is evolution proved:\n Prediction 1.4: Intermediate and transitional forms: the possible morphologies of predicted common ancestors\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section1.html#pred4\n Part of this would include showing how man evolved; through observations of the evidence, and how that evidence fits into evolution.\n There are mutually exclusive theories here and they are all used to show how man evolved. I have pointed out that evolution does not rely solely on these mutually exclusive theories. But, they are used, and therefore 'relied upon' to explain how man arose.\n The whole web-page is called \"29+ Evidences for Macroevolution\" it is not just a whole bunch of 'evidences'. It is evidences that are used to make predictions, to demonstrate how \"A\" evolved into \"A1\" and \"A2\" etc.\n Evolution relies upon these evidences.\n \nIf you just say 'evolution happened' and don't rely on no explanation of 'how', then you have created a massive 'just-so' statement.\n\n \nHere, I must ask for clarification&#8230; Are you suggesting that we determine specifically how the frequency of alleles changes in a population over time?\n\n I am saying that one of the 'proofs' for evolution is given that man evolved from lower forms. \"How?\" is the valid question that they answer by putting forward theories. Some of these are mutually exclusive. If they don't demonstrate \"How?\" then you are saying 'it just is'.\n \nI&#8217;ll defer to a biologist who can explain this fact in detail. Or are you suggesting we determine specifically how modern man came to be what it is today? As is evidenced by the multiple, mutually exclusive theories that exist (some of which you have brought to our attention), I&#8217;m not aware that we yet can answer this question. However, given what we know about biological populations from years of observed evidence, there is no current hypothesis that fits the observed evidence &#8211; except evolutionary theory, meaning that the genetic characteristics that make up our current population has been changing over time&#8230; and the further back we go into history, the more changes that have been observed.\n\n Yes, I know that, that's why there are several theories. And yes, you recognise that I present one of them for discussion.\n \nBut scientists endeavour to show evolution has happened. \n\n \nI don&#8217;t think this is an accurate statement. Almost all scientists recognize that evolution happens. Some of them endeavour to show exactly the route that a particular species took in its evolutionary development.\n\n Then when they 'recognise evolution happens' it is based on what? A 'just-so' statement, or is it based on ideas of how to put the evidences together? Recall, I never said evolution solely relies on mutually exclusive theories, but it is without doubt that it does use these to show evolution.\n \nAnd some of the theories, (interpretations of the evidence), they put forward are mutually exclusive.\n\n \nWhy do you continue to stress this irrelevant point?\n\n It is not irrelevant, and I started to address it in another thread. If you accept that some of these theories are mutually exclusive, and are used to demonstrate evolution, then what's your point?\n Otherwise you are suggesting that evolution is demonstrated by some ethereal 'body of evidence' that just 'is'. It just 'is not'. It is worked into and by schools of thought to show how evolution happened.\n \nAnd the evidence points to, in some cases mutually exclusive theories. \n\n \nHere you do it again&#8230;\n\n You do have a point?\n \nNo, they are relied upon to show how evolution happened. See quote above; 'The evidence for historical evolution is so over-whelming that evolution is considered a fact'.(ibid) \n\n \nThe mutually exclusive hypotheses to which you are referring attempt to explain how evolution occurred&#8230;\n\n Yes, that's what I've been saying. In order to show 'how' they use these schools of thought, they rely on them to show 'how'.\n \nthe specific route that it took to bring us where we are today. The fact that evolution happens does not depend upon these hypotheses; rather, evolution depends upon the body of evidence that supports it.\n\n This is ridiculous. Then you are again pointing to some series of unconnected pieces of evidence which mean absolutely nothing, other than they prove evolution. Evolution is not just change in alles, but a large theory of how all species share common descent.\n \nIf any ONE piece of evidence can be shown to contradict the theory of evolution, then it will have to be modified to fit that evidence &#8211; or else scrapped in favour of a new theory that does fit the evidence.\n\n Yes, but the mutually exclusive theories don't contradict 'evolution' but each other. Thus to show 'evolution' it doesn't matter how many theories that are mutually exclusive are presented.\n \nGiven all the tests that evolution has passed to this point in time, it is highly unlikely (though certainly possible) that new evidence will be discovered that refutes evolutionary theory.\n\n That is the topic for another debate.\n \nRather, as new evidence is discovered, new hypotheses will be developed that better explain the specifics of the evolutionary path that our ancestors took.\n\n You are reverting back to the 'just-so' that all sorts of bits of unconnected evidences just points to evolution.\n \nNot quite. Evidence is 'there'.\n\n \nAre you claiming here that you know of evidence that refutes evolutionary theory? I find this hard to believe, but if you demonstrate this evidence, I&#8217;m all ears!\n\n Let's try a hypothetical for a moment. Say I have some evidence that refutes evolution; a human skull. There that's evidence that refutes evolution. (end of hypothetical; I await your response)\n \nScientists use it to demonstrate one hypothesis/theory. Some other group of scientists use it to demonstrate another hypothesis/theory. Regardless, my book showed all four schools as possible. \n\n \nYou seem to be stuck in this fallacy of thinking that hypothesis in their earlier periods cannot be mutually exclusive without invalidating a different theory. It&#8217;s okay for hypotheses to be mutually exclusive. Happens all the time. One of them may accurately describe reality. Maybe none of them can explain newly discovered evidence. If that&#8217;s the case, then a new hypothesis is created. Maybe several new ones. Maybe some of these new ones are also mutually exclusive. One of them may accurately describe reality. Maybe none of them do. This is the way it works. This is the scientific process. Pretty simple.\n\n Yes and it is these hypothesis that are used to show how evolution happened. I posted one of these theories, and you and I and Mach have been debating over it.\n \nMach and your own dedication to stifling the dissemination of information is remarkable. \n\n \nYou are welcome to your opinion. Though, I don&#8217;t believe either one of us has any problem whatsoever with you disseminating valid information. Your claim that a scientific theory relies upon other hypotheses is what both of us are attempting to clarify.\n\n That's right, you believe in something esoteric, that evolution just relies on 'evidence'. It's not constructed into any meaningful way, it just 'is there'. And it just supports evolution.\n I also believe that you are confused by my statement about evolution relying on mutually exclusive theory. I have stated before I am not saying that the process of evolution depends on this, but that the theory of evolution does. This is now the second time I've pointed this out.\n \nThen you are saying you can't show how evolution happened.\n\n [quote=thebootfitter]If you are asking whether I know the specific evolutionary route that our ancestors took in order to bring us where we are today, you are correct. I can&#8217;t show how this happened. I don&#8217;t know. In fact, no one knows. That&#8217;s why there are hypotheses in place (some of which are mutually exclusive)&#8230; some scientists are attempting to find an explanation that fits all the observed evidence, and does not contradict any known evidence.[/quote[\n Refer again to web-site above. The reason scientists say that evolution happened is not just based on 'evidence' but a demonstration of how that evidence shows evolution.\n \nYou actually need to read what was in the articles they put forward. I used a 'catch-phrase' title, that seems to be something you've obsessed with. \n\n \nHuh? Nevermind&#8230;\n\n \nThis is startling that you would be so dismissive of it without actually demonstrating any rudimentary knowledge of what it is you're dismissing. \n\n \nHow have I been &#8216;dismissive&#8217; of&#8230; Nevermind again&#8230; it&#8217;s a non-issue that is irrelevant to my point.\n\n Then what's your point?\n Let me try another tack... I will use your standard for debate, but use it for God.\n You are in effect arguing for evolution the way people argue for God. God exists. I can point to evidences for God. Creation, we are here. Life exists. These are the evidences for God. The evidences show that God exists. It doesn't matter 'how' they are used to demonstrate God existing, and it doesn't matter that several religions are mutually exclusive. The 'how' is totally unimportant because there is evidence for God. The evidence 'just points to God' and it need not be worked into a hypothesis, becuase it the theory is not reliant upon the hypotheses.\n Recall the hypothetical above? The human skull. By your rationale of arguing I don't need do anything other than present the skull as evidence. It doesn't have to fit into any theory, and even if it did or not, it wouldn't disprove the over-arching theory that my statement 'just is right'. That is exactly what you are saying with evolution. That all the evidences just point to evolution.\n \nIn fact, I don&#8217;t really care to continue addressing your comments from this post. It&#8217;s fun exchanging posts with you, but sometimes it can be tiring. For whatever it&#8217;s worth, my opinion is that posts are typically more effective when they have a clearly stated point and concise supporting evidence. My opinion is that too many things get lost and confused in a long post (such as this current response to you). Whaddaya say, we both make a concerted effort to keep our posts succinct and meaningful?\n\n Your points need to be addressed.",

   "I concede to the absurdity of continuing this line of discussion. \n \n Peace out,\n The Bootfitter\n\n Ironically you two both seem to believe that the vast body of scientific work is pointless, because none of it is needed to show how evolution 'is', because the evidence itself just shows that.\n I am sorry that the Bootfitter feels this debate is a nonsense. I am simply now positing statements for God in the same language he and Mach use for evolution.\n But first...\n A SUMMARY:\n Mach first argued that they weren't theories, but hypotheses, post #7\n Trochilidae (post #14) claimed that they weren't to do with the evolution of man in China.\n Mach then implies that I am saying it the explanation of the theory of evolution relies solely on these two theories.\n \n2. You claim Evolution relies on these theories, yet we know it relies on the body of evidence that supports it, not these two theories.\n\n (post #20)\n and also same post\n \nYou clearly state that you believe the foundation of evolution is based on these two mutually exclusive theories, which is false\n\n Then he denies this (#22)\n \n The Bootfitter has chimed in\n Post 35\n \n And what you are saying is not accurate. No theory relies upon other hypotheses for its validity. A theory relies upon observed data.\n\n I believe that this needs to be modified to read:\n It is a nonsense that people just observe data. Data is interpreted.\n A theory relies upon observed data put into a workable and meaningful way (hence into a hypothesis). How it is put into a meaningful way? Well in the case for man's ascent one school of thought shapes it one way, another school, another way. These two schools happen to be mutually exclusive..\n Post 35 again\n \nYou&#8217;re not serious, are you? Are you aware of one single observation that contradicts evolutionary theory? If so, please share it. Otherwise, let&#8217;s defer to the body of evidence collected over the years that supports evolutionary theory.\n\n Well, all the observations of evidence; do they just prove evolution; or are they actually connected to a theory somehow. Do people just look at a skull of Lucy and say \"This is evidence for evolution; because it is observed to be\"? It doesn't rely on any hypothesis for how it fits in anywhere at all. It just is evidence that is just observed and it just proves evolution. How does the skull of Lucy show that alles have been changed from something to something else?\n One theorist might say that the skull shows the transition from type \"A\" to type \"B\", another might say that it is a dead-end evolved from \"A\". Either way these hypotheses are used to show how evolution worked. The theoreticians rely on explanations to show 'how?' And they might come up with one theory of how Lucy's skull fits in, or they might come up with several, or several that are mutually exclusive. The evidence just doesn't 'exist'. It doesn't just prove an observation.\n \n Let's look at two different theories, using Mach/the Bootfitter's line of reasoning for both...\n Evolution: Change in allele frequency in a population over time\n Creation: Created by God in six days.\n That is the two theories. I can claim that there is evidence for the later. Creation itself, we are here, we are rational beings, we have souls etc.\n Is evolution proved by anything? No, not according to Mach and the Bootfitter, other than 'the observation of evidence'. Such a esoteric proof! SO, likewise God must be just proved by 'the evidence' too. As the Bootfitter said above \"No theory relies upon other hypotheses for its validity\" thus the observation of evidence for God does not need to rely on any shape of the evidence at all.\n \n In effect you are both dismissing the vast array of scientific work to show how evolution 'works' and just saying 'it works, based on the evidence'. Not only are the hypotheses irrelevant if they are mutually exclusive, they are irrelevant per se. Evolution: it just does. It just has been observed. No hypothesis of how the evidence points to evolution need matter at all, because evolution is proved. Thus as I stated, it is the ultimate 'just-so' belief.\n \n Most evolutionists don't say it's just 'observation' but point to how it is observed.\n A creationist claim might be\n \"Evolution has not been, and cannot be, proved. We cannot even see evolution (beyond trivially small change), much less test it experimentally.\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA202.html\n How do evolutionists refute this?\n \"Each new piece of evidence tests the rest....\n Fossil animals fit in the same tree of life. We find several cases of transitional forms in the fossil record.\"\n (Ibid), that is there's a theory showing a line of fossils; a tree of life. This is a hypothesis of how to interpret the fossil record. That is it is how the evidence demonstrates evolution. It isn't just 'observed', it is constructed into a hypothesis.\n (Note evidence and proof are two different things:\n \"Because the offer is as bogus as a $3 bill, and designed to be unmeetable. It's unclear whether Hovind wants \"evidence\" or \"proof\" of evolution. He mentions both, but they're entirely different things\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/faqs.html). Evolution doesn't just rely on evidence. Evidence doesn't just sit there.\n \n And why this re-action, because despite countless times telling you all of the reason I started this thread Mach still insists on seeing evil\n \nI submit that you have no point, and are teaching the controversy, based on the obvious lack of legitimate responses you make. Even thbootfitter is having to repeat himself in a vain attempt at getting you to actually debate rather than teach the controversy. I have done this too, many times, in fact, many posts start like this, but quickly devolve into nonsense. There are two types of debaters here. Those who debate to learn and test their knowledge, often conceding and adopting new beliefs. Those like yourself who debate solely to persuade and promote a belief that you have no intention of changing, regardless of the debates. Although, I'd like to be wrong on that last statement.\n -Mach\n",

It is constructed into arguments to show how it fits into the pattern of evolution. They have established evolution is proved to be a fact, by giving a catalogue of evidences (see Mach's most recent post).\n \n You may not be aware of the history of this debate. I published for discussion one of the many interpretations that evolution relies upon to show how evolution works. When I say this, I've been at pains to differentiate between claiming that a process of evolution depends on this theory, to the explanation of evolution relies on this theory (the later is the point I am making). It, the mult-regional model, is used to apply the evidence. And, it just so happens to be a model that is mutually exclusive of another model also used to explain how man ascended. Oddly, only one person has actually engaged me in a debate about the evidence I put forward; a banned poster; who claimed that it was nothing to do with the evolution of man. Everyone else is caught up in side-issues.\n \n Rather than discuss this point, and the new ideas of the multi-regional model, as I have stated again and again is why I posted this, I've had people argue that\n a) it's not a theory\n b) it's not used by (relied upon) by evolution\n c) and repeated questions from Mach as to why I'd post this information (and I'm now up to about eight times answering this one).\n \n As also stated, it is ironic that people such as Mach would undermine the vast amount of work (which I don't agree with, but that's another point), that scientists endeavour upon to show how the evidence proves evolution. Scientists don't just go out into the field and catalogue evidences. They don't teach evolution by saying 'this is the catalogue of evidences'.\n \n They use evidences (I used the term 'rely upon) to fit into a theory. The bootfitter argued that the proof of evolution is totally divorced from any such series of hypotheses. Which is not backed up by any thing other than him and Mach saying so; I endeavoured to show talkorigins going through a list of theories as to why evolution is believed to be a fact.\n I will ask you directly. Do you believe evolution relies upon (a jumble of) evidence, or a collection of reasoned hypotheses?\n I repeat, I present one of these, and it is used to support evolution. It might well fall by the way, but without hypotheses, then there seems to be only a series/catalogue of disjoined evidences.\n Incidentally, on another thread I put forward a discussion about mutually exclusive theories, so I have not avoided the issue. I had no desire for it to be connected with this thread because they are two issues.",

You should cease projecting your own non-argument style onto other people.\n \n Now for the mix-up...\n \n I think you are both trying to be cute here. Unkerpaulie hit the nail on the head. Here's what one evolutionist site says...\n \n \"Q: I thought evolution was just a theory. Why do you call it a fact? \n A: Biological evolution is a change in the genetic characteristics of a population over time. That this happens is a fact. Biological evolution also refers to the common descent of living organisms from shared ancestors. The evidence for historical evolution -- genetic, fossil, anatomical, etc. -- is so overwhelming that it is also considered a fact. The theory of evolution describes the mechanisms that cause evolution. So evolution is both a fact and a theory.\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/faqs-qa.html\n Here's another...\n \"A century's accumulation of such evidence establishes descent, with modification, from common ancestors as a fact of science. How we explain this fact&#8212;what the principles and causes of it may be&#8212;is the theory of evolutionary process, parts of which are subject to various amounts of scientific debate, modification, and extension.\"\n http://evonet.sdsc.edu/evoscisociety/evolu_fact_theo.htm\n Evolutionists argue that it is a fact. Evolution is taught as being true. The arguments against teaching creation in schools in part rested on the 'truthfulness' of evolution. That's what evolutionists in general argue. Specifically, here's what you two have said...\n \n Post 28 you use an analogy to show that regardless of the theories, the fact (in this case, geese fly south) happens to be true.\n \n Post 33\n \nWhen a particular hypothesis is supported by many observations over and over again, and is not contradicted by any of the observations that have been made over the course of time, it will be regarded as a theory. &#8220;The validity of a hypothesis does not stand or fall based on just a few confirmations or contradictions, but on the totality of the evidence.&#8221;\n\n Thus, for you evolution is based on the evidence. (By the way, I thought you'd left this thread! Post 37)\n \n Post 35\n \nAlmost all scientists recognize that evolution happens\n\n Thus, for you, it is true.\n \n Post 39\n \nI very much do claim you said that evolution relies on these mutually exclusive theories. Because, you did. See, that's reason, and it relies on evidence. But I do understand you do not require evidence to accept something as a truth.\n\n Mach says I, unlike he, do not require evidence to know what is true. The implication here is that he knows what is true, because of the evidence. In fact he's said it so many times in so many ways that he believes I have faith - which for him is based on lack of evidence, again implying he knows the opposite of faith; fact , based on the evidence.\n \n If either of you wish to state that evolution is not true, but is based on evidences that you're not sure about, you're welcome to clarify your positions. This seems to be what you now wish to say \"Evolution is not true (in an absolute sense) although it is taught as a fact because it is supported by a catalogue of evidences which themselves are open to mutually exclusive interpretations and hypotheses, even though these hypotheses are themselves not important; just a catalogue of evidences.\"",

   "Hello Mach:\n Evolution does not rely on either of these theories or hypotheisis, it relies on the body of evidence that support it.\n \n With relation to the alleged human evolution, could you please list some of the \"body of evidence that support it\"?\n \n To Alan Ryan:\n It's [evolution] a well-tested and internally consistent (biological) explanation of how the species differentiated from a common ancestor over time (a long time).\n  \n \n Wow, would you look at this, I'm not the only one who says that evolutionary theory states that everything goes back to a common ancestor, i.e. a microbe. It is not just the varriation that we see today - which can also be easily accounted for in the creationary model. You used the words over a long time. So, please tell me, how can scientists \"test\" (or by any other scientific methods) events that happened in the vrey distant unobservable past when we do not see these macro evolutionary changes happening today? The only changes in species that we do observe today - which I agree with - are down-hill genetic changes in which the organism has lost DNA information from the genome, either due to mutation or some other natural process. See, heres the thing, how can you believe that one kind of creature (e.g. reptile) can change into a completely different kind of creature (e.g. bird) when you don't observe it happening today and all the genetic changes that we observe in today's world are heading in to a loss of genetic information (which is in the opposite of what is required for microbe to man evolution).\n \n I agree with the changes in species we observe, I agree with the natural selection and mutations that we observe and I agree with the biology we observe. I don't disagree with the geology we observe, I don't disagree with the astronomy we observe, and the list goes on in a similar fassion. In fact, there is nothing in this universe that I disagree with an evolutionist about what you observe, what I do disagree with them about is their interpretation  of the observation or evidence. Which really brings this whole issue of creation/evoluion down to a battle about the interpretations of the evidence. Because creationists and evolutionists are working from different starting faiths (or assumptions), they will come up with different conclusions about the same piece of evidence - depending on what their starting beliefs are. So this whole debate isn't over the evidence, both creationists and evolutionists are in complete agreement  over the evidence, the argument is over which interpretation of the evidence best fits the evidence and hence, is the right interpretation. Until the people of this forum understand that it is the interpretation of the evidence that we are arguing about, we will achieve nothing - just the usual false and misleading rhetoric, e.g. cretionists lie about the evidence, etc., etc..\n \n For example, we will use the natural processes of mutation and natural selection to illustrate this point. Both of these processes result in a loss of genetic information. This fits in perfectly with the creationary account, i.e. God created in unique kinds with massive amounts of genetic information that allow for massive amounts of variation within that kind. The dog kind is a classic example of this. We believe that all dogs (including wolves, jackals, dingos, domestic dogs, etc.) came most likely from just two dogs that had enormous potential for genetic variation. Thus, over time, the genetic information in the dog kind has thinned out as dogs adapt to their respective environments and what have you. Thus causing the massive variation that we observe in dogs. Sometimes I wonder that if an evolutionist in the future found the fossils of a Great Dane and a Chihuahua (I hope that is how it is spelt) whether or not he'd recognise that they belonged to the same family or genus!\n \n Although the evolutionary account can cope with a loss of genetic information from a creatures genome (e.g. through mutations and natural selection), it needs a lot of addition of genetic information (DNA) to a creature's genome. This would be good if we saw these sort of changes happening, but the truth is, we don't. Dr Richard Dawkins on the Answers in Genesis documentary \"From a Frog to a Prince\" illustrated this point that there is no natural or evolutionary process that can account for an increase in DNA (or genetic information) to the genome of a creature when he was asked by the presenter something to the effect of:\n \"Dr Dawkins, can you give any natural or evolutionary process that can be seen add new genetic information to the genome?\" \n Dr Dawkins response? Chilling silence. He had no response. Anyway, after a few seconds the camera came back on and the answer he gave didn't answer the question. The Australian Skeptics Association thought that AiG had misrepresented him and that it was a creation conspiracy, so they gave Dr Dawkins three whole pages in which to defend himself. But guess what? He still didn't answer the question! I say this not to put him down, because it was a hard question to answer. More like an impossible question to answer. The area of biology is very powerful for creation as opposed to the naturalistic evolutionary model.\n \n However, as evolution has no way to get either any initial information, or the information necessary for each increase in complexity, it can be ruled out of contention as the way living things came to be. \n \n Here is a rather unusual example of a mutation in action - destroying DNA information. Natural selection also destroys the genetic information rather than creating new ones. Therefore, since the creationary model does not involve new DNA being added to the genome of a creature, we come to the logical conclusion that creation is the better of the two interpretations of the evidence.\n \n The simple stick instect is also a major problem for evolutionists with their wings believed to have evolved, devoled, and than re-evolved independently on several occasions. Story telling.\n \n You seem to have an unrealistic knowledge of what science is and how it's application is limited. Naturally, one can only observe (experiment and repeat observations on) what exists in the present. This in itself implies that science can only deal with the present. It is just as easy task to understand that no scientist was present over the suggetsed millions of years to witness the supposed evolutionary progression of life from the simplex to the complex, nor to observe the first life forming in some primeval sea. No living scientist was also there to observe the big bang that is suppoed to have occured 15 billionish years ago. No scientist was there - no human witness was there to see these events occurring. They certainly cannot be repeate today. All the evidence that a scientist has exists only in the present. All the fossils, the living animals and plants, the world, the universe - in fact, everything - exists now in the present. The average person is not taught that scientist have only the present and cannot deal directly with the past. Evolution is a belief system about the past, based on the words of fallible men who were not there, but who are trying to explain how all the evidence of the present (that is, fossils, animals, and plants, etc.) orginated.\n \n \n This article Genetics: no friend of evolutioni basically sums up some of the points that I have been trying to get across. I've got to go now, Dad's telling me to go have a shower than head off to bed.",

   "Yet you believe that this is true. Later you'll deny that you can only know truth except by maths/logic.\n \n Then you've just created a paradox. You've just states as true that we can never know truth. You in fact make word games yourself, unfortunately, you aren't big on insight.\n Your word gamed state that 'evolution is true, based on evidences put together in uncertain ways.\" That is one of them. Another is \"Materialist science is rational, proven by the following irrational argument.... (insert your own argument based on philosophy)\".\n You do exactly the same thing all the time; here's a few others for you to chuckle over. \n a) Evolution is true, because it is.\n b) God is false because there's no evidence that would account for God, based on the fact I only accept evidence that wouldn't include God anyway.\n It is why you can so easily both argue that one can never know truth, but you (think you) know as true there is no God.\n Almost every time you post you do so with sophistry, but lack the insight to see this, because, (see circular reasoning) you believe you are right, and I am wrong! Why? Because you are!\n \n That is your opinion, unless you think it true.\n \n You can know truth.\n \n Actually you've already established that you think you can; through science.\n \n Is that true?\n \n You know this to be true, how?\n \n Yes, you keep issuing this statement. It is your own sophist argument I have answered time and time again. But then, you believe you're right, and I'm wrong.\n \n Then we're back to you arguing against an absolute truth, of God, based on your now concession that your own beliefs are not based on truths, in an absolute sense. Yet you have evidence? Go figure!\n \n No it doesn't. The evidence is made to fit evolution, based on the circular reasoning you exhibit, that it is true.\n \n Again you are dealing with an absolute truth; that there is no other credible theory. Your argument is certainly all over the place. It needs to be as you sinuously apply what is and isn't true.\n \n What's not true about truth? Again you've come up with a novel definition. If it is a degree of truth, then you need to state it as such.\n\n \n Good. Now that we've established we can know truth for the purposes of this debate and all future debates (only took about 3 months):\n \n True: 5 a : that is fitted or formed or that functions accurately\n http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictiona...tionary&va=true\n \n Evolution: \"Evolution: Change in allele frequency in a population over time\"\n \n And in actuality, this definition of evolution functions accurately when used to describe the diversity and changing of life on earth. So, I'm going with \"true\", by this definition. Of course, since my truth is based on evidence, I can certainly \"know\" a different truth. \n =======================================\n \n As you can see, I'm correct to claim evolution as true. \n \n \nYou do exactly the same thing all the time; here's a few others for you to chuckle over. \n a) Evolution is true, because it is.\n b) God is false because there's no evidence that would account for God, based on the fact I only accept evidence that wouldn't include God anyway.\n It is why you can so easily both argue that one can never know truth, but you (think you) know as true there is no God.\n\n \n Again, please do not quote me without both quotes and post #, you exhibit both fallacy (strawman, since I never say what you claim I say), and it is not relevant to the argument at hand.\n \n -Mach",

(And I seem to be the only one blamed for word-games :))\n Then he repeatedley questioned why I'd present such information. Which I answered eight times.\n Mach stated that evolution didn't rely on theories, but on evidences. The Bootfitter seconded this.

A good, but trivial, answer is: From Africa, like everybody else's genes. Paleontologists agree that the long-term human ancestors, a million years ago or so, dwelt in Africa. There is disagreement, however, about what happened after archaic presapiens humans (Homo erectus) spread over much of the Old World. The anatomically archaic populations of Europe, Northeastern Asia, and Southeastern Asia may have gradually evolved into the modern Homo sapiens sapiens populations inhabiting, respectively, Western Eurasia, East Asia, and Australia; this is the multiregional theory of human evolution (1). On the contrary, the Out-of-Africa theory regards all modern populations as descended from an anatomically modern group that dispersed from Africa less than 200,000 years ago and replaced archaic populations (2). \"\n http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/98/1/22\n Disagreement based on what? Well, on the current theories of the ascent of Man...\n \"The current controversy is largely a reflection of different scientific philosophies, linked to ideas about race through their treatment of variation. But there is more to it. Even if they have no conscious social agenda, scientists are bound by the same preconceptions as everyone else - their social, religious, and educational backgrounds influence their choices of theories and, perhaps more important, their philosophies of science. Karl Popper noted more than once that it doesn't matter where hypotheses come from, only whether they explain the evidence they are based on, wether they are subject to disproof, and whether they can hold up to enthusiastic attempts to disprove them. This philosophy forms the basis of deductive science. But hypothesis do come from somewhere, often the underlying assumptions of society. Moreover, not only the differences in sources of ideas, but also different premises scientists have held about evolution, human nature, God, and how science should be done, have always underscored the controversies about human evolution.\"\n \n Wolpoff, M & Caspari, R, (1997) \"Race and Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction\", p12.\n \n \n \n Your notions of race will lead you to fit the evidence to the theory you already hold. Although they all here agree that evolution did happen, the 'how?' question is resolved only in light of a priori beliefs.\n \n \nSuppose you have to see a doctor - would you be happy with his/her diagnosis given PRIOR to looking for signs and asking about symptoms\n - i.e. the evidence upon which a medically informed identification of your illness will be given ? N.B. A doctor's education and training are based on the natural sciences.\n\n So? Even doctors work on assumptions; hence they make mistaken diagnonses, or haven't you heard of them?\n Scientists often, even sub-consciously will disregard evidences that they've not been trained to use. Scientists are trained to take a particular approach.\n \n Many studies have been shown that scientific error is often a process of scientists own bias. Evolutionary scientists are not isolated from society. Conventions of society and transferred into the laboratory of science. Why is this so? It is because it order for science to be less in error, people need to know that science is part of human thought organisation, and is prone to be subjected to all the biases and flaws of the scientists themselves. Note too, that this comment above states that science curriculum's around the world differ. Thus what is considered important for a science education differs from nation to nation; this is influenced by socio-political factors. Thus the 'science' of a communist nation is not the same as the 'science' of a occidental capitalist nation - though both may be applying 'scientific' principles.\n \n \n \n Gender bias can be the cause of error, or of not immediately recognising truths.

You will find most rebuttals against Darwinism are given along the lines of \"This was already successfully argued - somewhere else.\" It is the same statement I often confronted on this forum, people would say \"You were retorted 'somewhere' else'.\n Dembski treats this in the foreword to his book Dembski, W. A. (ed) &#8220;Uncommon Dissent: Intellectuals who Find Darwinism Unconvincing&#8221;, p xxvff under \"The myth of victory past\"\n He states \"David Ray Griffin, a philosopher with no animus against Darwinism or sympathy for Behe's intelligent design perspective remarks: \"The response I have received from repeating Behe's claim is that I obviously have not read the right books. There are, I am assured, evolutionists who have described how the transitions in question could have occurred contra Behe...When I ask in which books I can find these discussions , however, I either get no answer or else some titles that, upon examination, do not in fact contain the promised accounts...\"\n David Ray Griffin \"Religion and Scientific Naturalism: Overcoming the conflicts\" (quoted in Ibid, p xxvi)\n Dembski himself sets out to look at one such case where Andrea Bottaro of the University of Rochester Medical Centre dismissed Behe in such a way; prattling about a number of sources containing already made arguments. Dembski took the time out to investigate each one and found many don't even talk about the issue.\n So in effect scientists are differing to the general body of science, that somewhere out there, science does have an answer to the questions posed by anti-Darwinists.\n \nMy point about the doctor was to illustrate that \"assumptions\" if you like come AFTER the evidence (of disease) has been considered in a scientific\n way.

Evolution is used to explain everything in nature.

But scientists do not countenance deference to \"authorities\" analogous to the pope (or to the Queen of England) should they choose to enter a scientific discourse.\n\n Not true, either. Scientists are of course deferring to people who are experts in other fields... and likewise, scientists rely on each other in what is called 'big science'. Further errors may present themselves with the advent of 'big science'; &#8220; the organization of large numbers of scientists bringing different bodies of expertise to a common research project.&#8221; (http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/s...owledge-social/)\n Hardwig in 1985 published research on the 'big science' project. He suggests that because a project becomes so large, no one scientist is an expert on all matters of the project; therefore there is a reliance upon the expertise of others in the project. &#8220;This leads Hardwig to ask two questions, one about the evidential status of testimony, and one about the nature of the knowing subject in these cases. With respect to the latter, Hardwig says that either the group as a whole, but no single member, knows or it is possible to know vicariously. Neither of these is palatable to him. Talking about the group or the community knowing smacks of superorganisms and transcendent entities and Hardwig shrinks from that solution. Vicarious knowledge, knowing without oneself possessing the evidence for the truth of what one knows, requires, according to Hardwig, too much of a departure from our ordinary concepts of knowledge.&#8221; (Ibid)\n \nIt is undeniable that Science exists in a cultural context and that scientists have their share of failings that afflict the rest of humanity. Scientists make\n mistakes - but when errors, misconceptions, frauds, etc., are detected by the scientific community, corrections are made and new formulations adopted that are consistent with the evidence.\n\n I agree. I am not anti-science, but I have no wish to see scientists set on a pedestal above the rest of humanity; as you seem to think; that even if they are mistaken; they cancel each other out; similar argument I'd use about my Church; that they are infallible, even though the individual members are fallible.\n \nScience does not have the mutability of a mere cultural artefact.

   "*tsk tsk* so much meaningless bickering. it started here:\n rather than work with the premises, the thread went downhill when the semantical irk of \"proven by the evidence\" was pounced on. at least nu leader could stay on track\n to me, this should be the crux of the debate. exactly what evidence SUPPORTS evolution or creation.\n mach and bootfitter provided the fossil record, mutations, genetic study, and natural selection in the wild as pieces of evidence that support evolution\n monty provided souls, intellegent design, the fact that order exists and a list of essays and articles on the matter as evidence that support creation\n rather than get into personal attacks and methodical, semantical and technical nit-picking, i'd like to see this discussion get back on track\n i have my thoughts on both sides of the debate, but for now i'm not going to pick a side. its not that i'm defending creationists because i commended nu leader and monty, but because i think mach and bootfitter could have much better addressed the core of the matter but opted to get on more trivial issues\n\n \n Ante up or don't bother with a critique, would be my suggestion, that's back-seat debating.\n \n I don't know about what your point is, but my debate points are with Montalban's post, not some broad topic as you mention. Furthermore, Montalban and I have a short history of debates on this issue to which we both pretty much know what we agree to disagree on. He and I have been through your topic on other threads, and yes, surprise, surprise, they also veer off topic so far that they are dead threads. If you have ever debated with montalban, you're probably familiar with the phenomenon. It's not within your control, nor mine, it's up to Montalban to stay on track, which I feel he chooses not to. If you want to pick one up or pursue it here, by all means, carry on. I would even be pleased if just to prove me wrong, Montalban stayed on topic :) \n \n My debate point is with the thread topic. Why was it posted? Why is it relevant? Which is the \"crux\" as you might say, of this post. I posted it about what Montalban, 4 or 5 times? Then I get accused of going off topic? *shrug*. The only reason I rejoined the debate once my arguments were not rebutted, was because my name, specifically, was mentioned, and yes, I stuck to the phrase my name was mentioned in, and chose not to rejoin the debate in full. thebootfitter was having a go and I was content to read. I don't get much out of Montalban debates intellectually speaking, they are 95% spin control, so if someone else takes up the slack, I enjoy the break.\n ------------------------------------------------\n My originial point:\n \n \nMontalban:\n I am simply putting forward for comment one of the mutually exclusive theories that evolution relies upon. \n \n \n \n1. Two theories can be mutually exclusive, what's your issue with this exactly?\n 2. Evolution does not rely on either of these theories or hypotheisis, it relies on the body of evidence that support it.\n\n \n To which Montalban claims evolution DOES rely on these two posted theories.\n If you feel inclined to teach the basics to Montalban on that, please do, I don't feel like expending the energy in this thread, as I say, others were doing fine. If you know Montalban, you know that his goal is not to arrive at a conclusion, but to spin. You aren't going to pin him if he chooses not to be pinned, but you can show the absurdity of some of his claims/arguments (and he can attempt the same on me of course).\n \n Please do share your thoughts though, and feel free to debate  it too, but you have to climb over the ropes and put in your mouth piece, otherwise Montalban might throw a chair at you if you sit on the side-lines and yell at the fighters ;)\n \n -Mach",

   "After so many attempts to get to the heart of the matter of what is meant by a \"scientific activity\", it's incredible that you should be content with the\n glib statement \"evolution is accepted as a given\"\n\n It's the argument presented by your side. When I posted the \"Out of China\" thread there were two posters, at least who challenged that evolution is supported by theories, rather, they said it is just supported by 'evidence'; the theories of how that evidence is placed in any context was, to them, superfluous. Therefore 'evolution is just supported' or 'just is' is what people have been saying to me. I actually stated that they are making a 'just-so' statement, and Mach continues to argue in favour of this.\n \nIf an individual accepts an unexamined assumption or a starting premise as an a priori \"given\", then whatever he may allege, he is not doing science. \n\n This is flawed as you've written off theoretical science in one swoop.\n \nScientific enquiries do not proceed by means of deductive logic.\n\n This is not true either. Galileo made observations, and although he didn't have the means of knowing all of what he observed, he made deductive logic in order to state what it was that he was observing; only being confirmed much later on (by Kepler, I believe).\n Scientists use deductive inference, logic, inductive inferences etc.\n \nNo, evolution is not accepted as a \"given\" :\n\n Yes it is. Evolution is accepted by a large amount of scientists as 'true'. Therefore every observation made is couched in the terms of evolution. If a scientist discovers a new skull, he'll be thinking \"How did this evolve?\".\n \nthe theory of evolution has been developed from the evidence that existed but the significance of which had not been systematically addressed until around Darwin's time.\n\n Darwin himself didn't have the key evidences, such as DNA, or even, going by the technology of his day he was missing the fossil record; which he himself stated might well show him to be wrong.\n \nOver the last 150 years, of course, new evidence and new ways of interpreting it have had the effect of increasing the sophistication of the theory.\n\n Yes, within the frame-work that evolution is true.\n \nYou say you are not anti-science but spend a lot of energy in trying to discredit a perfectly valid scientific discipline.\n\n Science is a thing. I am not debating it. I am debating the people (scientists) and those such as several posters here, who set them up as ubermensch who are able to ascertain truths (even in a scientific and non-absolute sense) devoid of all human foibles. This has been one of the most thorny (judging by reactions) issues raised.\n \nThe only punch you've thrown in this thread that has any weight (in my opinion) is your point about the problem of cultural/social bias affecting the impartiality of a scientific enquiry.\n\n Many thanks. Several posters here would not concede any points to me at all... such is their indignant anger at someone who dares question their high priests of knowledge.\n \nThere are many differences (for instance) between American and say Japanese society. But a Japanese aeronautical engineer will solve his design problems using the same scientific principles, mathematics, etc as his counterparts at Boeing.\n\n Evolution is not so exact a science, so the analogy fails. You concede (a possibility of) cultural bias...but then minimise it by such an analogy...\n \n Scientists raised in Marxist states were taught to think about evolution by Marxist standards, thus they found evidences about the collective/co-operative nature of hominids. Capitalists tended looked to the 'competition' between individuals and species... and thus they found evidences for that.\n Example, starting with Engels (who establishes the philosophical frame-work into which Marxist scientists will be taught)\n http://www.ex.ac.uk/projects/meia/Archive/1876-Hands/\n (A study by Engels, that deals with how manual labour helped in the development of mankind - helping us grow a bigger brain than other apes.)\n Further...\n Engels recognised that the erect posture in walking represented &#8220;the decisive step in the transition from ape to man.&#8221; This allowed the hand to be free and could &#8220;attain ever greater dexterity and skill&#8221;. Thus states Engels, &#8220;the hand is not only the organ of labour, it is also the product of labour.&#8221; He then went on to explain that this had further revolutionary consequences. &#8220;But the hand did not exist by itself. It was only one member of an entire, highly complex organism. And what benefited the hand, benefited also the whole body it served.&#8221;\n http://www.marxist.com/Theory/origins_of_our_species501.html\n \n Capitalism is blessed by Darwin, in that Darwinism has influenced thinking of modernity.\n &#8220;The Darwinian worldview was critical, not only in influencing the development of Nazism and communism, but also in the rise of the ruthless capitalists that flourished in the late 1800s and early 1900s (Morris and Morris, 1996). A key aspect of this brand of capitalism was its extreme individualism which indicated that other persons count for little, and that it is both natural and proper to exploit &#8220;weaker&#8221; companies. The so-called robber barons often concluded that their behavior was justified by natural law and was the inevitable outcome of history (Josephson, 1934). Many were raised as Christians, but rejected their Christianity or modified it to include their socialist/Darwinian ideas. Gertrude Himmelfarb noted that Darwinism may have been accepted in England in part because it justified the greed of certain people. &#8220;\n http://www.icr.org/pubs/imp/imp-333.htm\n \n &#8220;In Marxism, groups are more important than individuals. Capitalists view nature as competitive, whereas these Marxist critics tend to view it as being much more cooperative.&#8221;\n http://www.stephenjaygould.org/reviews/hull_sociobiology.html\n \n Chinese nationalists are championing the muti-regional model of evolution.\n \n There is also gender-bias\n In &#8220;whose science? whose knowledge?&#8221; Sandra Harding argues that science is about power - especially with regards to gender.\n &#8220;Harding argues that, while Western sciences certainly have helped to develop some part of society, they have simultaneously helped to disempower others-such as many people of Third World descent, women and the poor, both here and around the world.&#8221;\n http://www.udel.edu/PR/UpDate/92/3/19.html\n Science is male-orientated.",

However, aside from this ego-centric way of reasoning I have in fact mentioned a thread already in which people have made such comments, and it was one he had posted on.

It is, I'm afraid, quite akin to the way the Medieval Catholic Church reacted to criticism. All arguments are put, and personal attack (on the person questioning this fact) is deemed rational.\n &#8220;The scientific establishment bears a grisly resemblance to the Spanish Inquisition. Either you accept the rules and attitudes and beliefs promulgated by the 'papacy' (for which read, perhaps, the Royal Society or the Royal College of Physicians), or face a dreadful retribution.

You super-men of science seem impervious to such things.\n \n Even when scientists accept this viz. when I quoted the following...\n \"The current controversy is largely a reflection of different scientific philosophies, linked to ideas about race through their treatment of variation. But there is more to it. Even if they have no conscious social agenda, scientists are bound by the same preconceptions as everyone else - their social, religious, and educational backgrounds influence their choices of theories and, perhaps more important, their philosophies of science. Karl Popper noted more than once that it doesn't matter where hypotheses come from, only whether they explain the evidence they are based on, wether they are subject to disproof, and whether they can hold up to enthusiastic attempts to disprove them. This philosophy forms the basis of deductive science. But hypothesis do come from somewhere, often the underlying assumptions of society. Moreover, not only the differences in sources of ideas, but also different premises scientists have held about evolution, human nature, God, and how science should be done, have always underscored the controversies about human evolution.\"\n \n Wolpoff, M & Caspari, R, (1997) \"Race and Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction\", p12.\n \n \n \n A well known, and more obvious one I've already posted, but you may have missed...\n \n It is capitalist science that drove many scientists to ignore the evidences of cancer from smoking; economic forces were brought to bare for a long time.

The aura of science surrounding their 'proofs' that this makes a less irritating smoke, does not convince many toxicologists that they were valid. Of the many irritating combustion products in tobacco smoke, the modification of one has probably little more than a psychological affect in reducing irritation felt by the smoker.&#8221;\n \n http://www.metromkt.net/viable/health27.shtml\n \n Note here, the company issued scientific data to back up their claims about the harmless nature of their product.

As the smoke pH increases above about 6.0, an increasing portion of the total smoke nicotine occurs in free form, which is rapidly absorbed by the smoker and...instantly perceived as a nicotine kick.&#8221;\n \n 1973-07-12: BUSINESS: RJR senior scientist Frank Colby sends Blevins a memo suggesting that the company &#8220;develop a new RJR youth-appeal brand based on the concept of going back--at least halfway--to the technological design of the Winston and other filter cigarettes of the 1950s,&#8221; a cigarette which &#8220;delivered more 'enjoyment' or 'kicks' (nicotine).&#8221; Colby said that &#8220;for public relations reasons it would be impossible to go back all the way to the 1955-type cigarettes.&#8221;\n \n 1996-10-17: Researchers disclose molecular link between a substance in tobacco tar and lung cancer: a benzo (a) pyrene derivative damages lung cancer-suppresser gene, p53, in the exact &#8220;hotspot&#8221; associated with lung cancer. Science magazine\n \n Ibid.\n \n \n \n This wasn't simply a case of 'new discoveries'. As litigation has shown, there was pressures put by economic forces upon scientists who in turn produced the science that backed up what multi-national tobacco companies wanted.\n \n Thus, one scientist who was in the pay for 25 years was...\n \n &#8220;According to Jean-Charles Rielle and Pascal Diethelm, the conclusion reached by one of Professor Rylander's projects on respiratory infections in young children and environmental factors, namely that tobacco smoke did not modify risks of illness in young children, was mind-boggling and, when one knew that he was one of Philip Morris's most highly paid consultants, tended to call into question the objectivity of his work.&#8221;\n \n http://www.tobacco.org/pages.php\n \n \n \n I used the example of smoking because its more widely recognized and accepted that there was on-going scientific fraud at the behest of tobacco companies. This is pertinent to the idea of bias in science, and how 'scientific truths' are modified in light of that bias. Many will claim here that this in fact shows the triumph of unfettered science; in over-coming this 'bias', but that's the gift of hindsight, because you can say 'now' we are right, whereas you were still certain a few decardes ago when scientists presented arguments to say smoking was harmless. Right now there's suggestions that mobile (or cell) phones can cause brain tumours. It will be interesting to see what socio-economic forces interact here in the findings of scientists. There's also conflicting evidences in fields of pollution and environmental studies, population studies, resources studies etc. There are the same biases at work now.",

   "lby the way, what are the 2 mutual exclusive theories that MONTALBAN was talking about?\n\n Be it known that they are two of many sets of mutually exclusive theories.*\n This particular set deals with the ascent of man.\n There were four, when I did pre-history at university....(text:Poirier, F E, &#8220;In Search of Ourselves: An Introduction to Physical Anthropology&#8221;, p346ff)\n the Unilinear School;\n the Polyphyletic School'\n the Preneanderthal School; and\n the Presapiens School\n were all valid possibilities to the pathway our ancestors took. This seemed ludicrous to me (then, and still), that each mutually conflicting theory would be accepted (as long as it doesn't involve God). And yet people can say that the evidence points to a conclusion... that is a Godless process took place. How were they mutually exclusive? Well if one were correct, then the others couldn't be...\n Generally, because they each propose a different pathway or series of pathways for human evolution. &#8220;Various possibilities have led to various interpretations... Variation of these theories are endless; they are constantly being revised and rejected.&#8221; p346 (Ibid)\n Now, there's the \"Out of Africa\" school, and the \"Multi-regional school\"\n \n \nfrom there we could determine if they are really mutually exclusive, and if the theory of evolution really relies on them\n\n This is the real issue, it seems, in this debate; even though this is not the debate I wished to have here. The Bootfitter and Mach have put forward the argument that the explanation of / the theory of evolution doesn't rely on any schools of thought AT ALL, but merely on the evidences.\n \n I maintain that this is bunk, because scientists actually do endeavour to construct the evidences into workable theories to show 'how' evolution has happened. And one of these is the \"Multi-regional' theory, which is exclusive of the Out of Africa model\n Here the evidence, it is suggested fits two different models...\"A lot of us have been too eager to assume that a strict out-of-Africa model is correct because it's compatible with the genetic data, without considering that the data also fit with the multiregional theory,\" says anthropologist John H. Relethford of the State University of New York at Oneonta. \"It's time to go back to the drawing board on this issue.\"\n http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_6_155/ai_53965045\n \n One review of the Wolpoff book states...\n &#8220;Race And Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction &#8220;\n \n by Milford Wolpoff, University of Michigan and Rachel Caspari, University of Michigan \"Race and Human Evolution is a far-ranging account by leading researchers in the field that describes the latest scientific evidence and the conflicting theories about human evolution.\"\n http://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/perseus-cgi-bin/display/0-8133-3546-9\n \"Where do the genes of the Europeans come from? A good, but trivial, answer is: From Africa, like everybody else's genes. Paleontologists agree that the long-term human ancestors, a million years ago or so, dwelt in Africa. There is disagreement, however, about what happened after archaic presapiens humans (Homo erectus) spread over much of the Old World. The anatomically archaic populations of Europe, Northeastern Asia, and Southeastern Asia may have gradually evolved into the modern Homo sapiens sapiens populations inhabiting, respectively, Western Eurasia, East Asia, and Australia; this is the multiregional theory of human evolution (1). On the contrary, the Out-of-Africa theory regards all modern populations as descended from an anatomically modern group that dispersed from Africa less than 200,000 years ago and replaced archaic populations (2). \"\n http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/98/1/22\n \n *In an article in support of evolution, one group stated\n &#8220;We actually wish more evolutionary theory was being taught, not less. Strengths and weaknesses. At the end of this historic day, I urge you to take the bold step of simply recognizing the most enduring controversy of mankind, that of origins. And that profound and seemingly intractable scientific difficulties with the various theories of evolution, in some cases mutually exclusive theories of evolution, do indeed exist and should not be covered up or otherwise censored. As a fifth generation Texan, I say we should lead in teaching both sides of the controversy and let the fittest survive. Please stop scientific censorship.&#8221;\n http://www.ntskeptics.org/2003/2003december/december2003.htm\n And despite the fact the bootfitter and Mach also argue 'so what if they're mutually exclusive' they've fought tooth and nail to deny evolution uses any.

   "Evolution is itself a type of 'unifying theory'. It has two major sub-theories, a 'special' and a 'general' theory of evolution; often referred to as 'micro-evolution' and 'macro-evolution'.\n \"You ask some excellent questions that are difficult to answer with a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\" As you seem rightly to perceive, \"evolutionary theory\" may be viewed as a collection of subtheories and hypotheses constantly under investigation. The idea of \"mainstream mechanisms\" hints at the answer you are seeking....The real question is, how important is punk eek in the entire structure of evolutionary theory? Scientists DO argue over the weight or relative importance of any subtheory or hypothesis when considering the whole subject.\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/feedback/may03.html\n \nAnd despite the fact the bootfitter and Mach also argue 'so what if they're mutually exclusive' they've fought tooth and nail to deny evolution uses any.\n\n \nRegardless of the theory we are discussing, one theory cannot use (or as you originally stated -- rely upon) another theory to support it. It would not be a valid theory if it did, since BY DEFINITION, a theory relies upon the evidence that supports it. When you attempt to argue this point, it becomes obvious that you do not understand the scientific method.\n\n Then you are arguing that evolution does not follow scientific method, and is not valid. I welcome you to my side of the debate.\n However, leaving aside this attempt at humour - when you ignore that scientists do indeed propose different theories on how man evolved. What do you call then the differing theories of how man arose? I'd like to see what novel creation you deem these to be.\n \nConsider that a theory is an explanation of how the objective evidence came to be what it is. A theory is predictive and can be used to determine what other kind of yet unknown evidence would be expected if the theory were valid. When unknown evidence becomes known and it still fits the pre-existing theory, then there is even more evidence that supports the original theory. If evidence is discovered that doesn't coincide with the theory, then the theory must be modified or set aside for a different theory that does coincide with the evidence. This method is the same regardless of the subject of the theory.\n\n Evolution is deemed a 'fact'. It is deemed a fact, because it is believed it demonstrates how man and life came into being through natural causes. When you ask any evolutionist 'how did man evolve?\" they will put forward one or several theories of how this happened, in order to show how the 'fact' of evolution is true.\n \nThere is no room for a 'sub-theory' or 'sub-hypothesis' to support another theory.\n\n \"Each evolutionary sub-theory (as described in Section 2) is supported by different evidence, and should have different plausibility. We need conceptual clarity; the sub-theories of evolution should be precisely defined and their relationships should be carefully analyzed, because if there is only \"evolution\" it is easy to assume that evidence for some aspects of evolution necessarily provides strong support for other aspects.\"\n http://www.asa3.org/ASA/education/origins/logic.htm\n \"So far, the theory evolution by means of natural selection (which was Charles Darwin's theory) has been shown to be the best explanation for the path evolution has taken life. The hypotheses (\"sub-theories\") of the exact nature of how natural selection works are constantly being modified as we learn more and more about our world. Those hypotheses are constantly challenged and should be (that's how science learns more!). And much of what Darwin and Wallace wrote about in their early work has been found to be incorrect, but the basic premise that evolution occurs through natural selection has not been disproved.\"\n http://www.interaktv.com/DARWIN/Evolution.html\n \"Parental investment theory predicts that parents will invest in the offspring that will, in the long run, contribute more to its reproductive success. Defined as &#8220;any investment by the parent in an individual offspring that increases the offspring&#8217;s chance of surviving&#8230;at the cost of the parents ability to invest in other offspring&#8221;, this theory allows for many evolutionary-based sub-theories to be drawn from it (Chacon-Pugnau & Jaffe, 1996). One such sub-theory is the concept of sex-ratio and sex-ratio biases posited by Hamilton (1967) and further developed by Trivers & Willard (1973). This theory suggests that females can prenatally bias the sex of their offspring towards the sex that is more likely to benefit from the mothers situation, and increase their inclusive fitness. In polygynous species, where only a handful of males but the majority of females will reproduce, it is expected that females with higher resource predictability will bias their offspring towards males, because male fitness depends more on size and condition than does female fitness (van Schaik & Hrdy, 1991)\"\n http://www.u.arizona.edu/~jons/sexratio.html\n Also see\n \"The Process of Logically Evaluating Theories of Evolution\"\n http://www.asa3.org/ASA/education/origins/scilogic.htm\n You and Mach have continually resorted to re-stating your opinion that I am wrong. It is very easy to do this. I have chosen the path of couching my argument not just in terms of what I believe, but by using supporting citations.\n \n And note too, I have stated a number of times that I started this post merely to discuss the muti-regional model. But it seems that I have ruffled a few feathers by even daring to discuss someone else's faith.\n\n \nPoint of clarification -- In case you are implying that you have 'ruffled my feathers,' you are quite inaccurate in your assessment. \n In post #4, you stated, \"I am simply putting forward for comment one of the mutually exclusive theories that evolution relies upon.\"\n This is the point of contention. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\n I believe your feathers are ruffled because you are trying to have a mutually exclusive argument of your own. Evolution relies on evidences constructed into hypotheses. This is true because I've shown evolutionary sties that show the various proofs - theories of how man arose etc. If you were really interested in debate, you might have not gone to this drawn-out series of debates based on your own notions of science, which are not based on reality... else cite your support. As shown by my citations, your belief in the non-existence of sub-theories is wrong. Scientists do use a number of theories to show how evolution happened, and in this way 'evolution' becomes itself a type of 'unifying theory' of materialism. There is already the assumption that evolution is a 'fact', or an over-arching theory, but still established as having happened. It is believed to have happened based on the evidences constructed into workable hypotheses. As long as these hypotheses use evidence, and don't contradict the tenet of 'materialism' then they are generally accepted as possibilities.\n \"Now, when man determines that God, the Alpha and the Omega of being, is out of the question, he is hard-pressed to fill in the blanks (in this case the metaphysicals gulfs which span and plumb the theoretical depths of the whole universe and mans existential being within). For again, even as a mere theory, theism explains very much. Absent theism and epistemological honesty, every question leads to more questions, as does every theory. And every theory breaks down into sub-theories, all of which spawn various---nay, endless---- schools of thought, each one partisan to a particular \"way of seeing\" things. And, of course, all genuine knowledge hangs on the \"ifs\"; and these \"ifs\"--- these contingencies--- which might go this way or that, break down into even more \"ifs\" at every critical juncture endlessly, spawning more and more schools of thought and ways of seeing things, ad infinitum. It is a serious problem and has led many to a post-modern despair that anything can be truly \"known\"\"\n http://www.tcrnews2.com/darwin.html\n \n Can we now all move on to talk about the muti-regional theory (that is one of the many mutually exclusive theories evolution relies on)?",

The Theory of Evolution is ITSELF a hypothesis that was constructed based upon the existing objective evidence.

As far as I am aware, there is no known evidence to date that does not coincide with the explanation offered by evolutionary theory.

   "Evolution relies on evidences constructed into hypotheses.\n\n \nLet's start with this incorrect statement.\n\n No, let's start with you conceding that I have posted a number of sites that back up my claim. You stated categorically that a theory does not depend on sub-theories. This is patently incorrect. Unless you research this and post evidence to support your opinion, it remains your un-supported opinion. (We go into your alleged evidence later on...)\n \nThe Theory of Evolution is ITSELF a hypothesis that was constructed based upon the existing objective evidence. It doesn&#8217;t rely on evidence that is constructed into various hypotheses that support another hypothesis.\n\n This is not supported by the citations I made. It is a theory that rests on the construction of evidence into workable explanation(s). Otherwise you consign evolution to a 'just-so' summary.\n \nRather, the validity of any hypothesis relies upon whether or not the objective evidence that is known to exist is explained by that hypothesis.\n\n The theory of evolution IS explained by the number of sub-theories which you claim don't exist.\n \nIt&#8217;s really that simple. Any hypothesis (regardless of the field of study) begins with objective evidence. A hypothesis is an attempt to explain how the evidence came to exist as it exists. If evidence is ever discovered that does not coincide with the hypothesis, then that particular explanation is obviously not valid and must be modified or discarded in favor of a hypothesis that DOES coincide with the evidence.\n\n That is not necessarily true. When evidence exists that does not fit an hypothesis it can and is ignored. That is why you could have four mutually conflicting theories, because some 'evidence' is deemed not to represent anything, or is inconclusive, and the theory marches on without it.\n \nAs far as I am aware, there is no known evidence to date that does not coincide with the explanation offered by evolutionary theory. (If you are aware of such evidence, please share it with me and with the world so that we can move forward with a different hypothesis that DOES coincide with all known evidence.)\n\n That is the point I have made in the past. All evidence can be made to support evolution because evolution itself is so wide and varied, that even when the evidence supports one sub-theory, it still supports evolution, even if it conflicts with another sub-theory that supports evolution.\n \nThe distinction it seems you fail to make is that evolutionary theory is a valid theory that fits all known evidence, while specific hypotheses of the specific path that one particular species took to become what it is today (which you so graciously offered us an example of in beginning this thread) have not been shown to fit all known evidence.\n\n That was the reason I posted it there in the first place, to look at one of the theories that supports evolution. You still deny that this is the case, and repeating your 'just-so' statements is something I'd have thought you'd have found tedious. If you have any support for your beliefs, you'd have posted them by now. I've laid evidence on the table and you've not.\n You have made two major errors so far.\n a) that evolution just is true (in a scientific sense) because of evidences - this is to make it a 'just-so' statement\n b) that there are no theories reliant on sub-theories.\n It is in fact near shocking that it is you who have continually belittled the scientists efforts - by consigning them to the category 'unnecessary'. I have maintained that scientists have endeavoured to show how evolution is true, by working on hypotheses where in the evidence is constructed into workable theories. You simply deny that this is necessary because evolution is supported by 'evidence' in no way connected into any meaningful way other than 'it just does' support evolution.\n You and Mach have resorted to attempts undermining your own cause. And ironically, it is I (the alleged man of anti-science) that is defending the efforts of these learned men. It is why you continue to resort to an 'evidence-lite' debating style... Even your reference to your evidence requires me and others to actually track it down to see what it actually says, in context. This is a typical debating tool used by pro-evolutionists, a vague reference to something said somewhere else that refutes a current debate.\n \nWhen one of these hypotheses DOES fit all known evidence, and no evidence can be found that contradicts the hypothesis over the course of time, then it is likely that it will be considered a &#8220;scientific fact&#8221; as well. Evolutionary theory does not rely in anyway, shape or form on hypotheses that attempt to explain the evolutionary path of one particular species.\n\n Show me proof.\n \nYou and Mach have continually resorted to re-stating your opinion that I am wrong. It is very easy to do this. I have chosen the path of couching my argument not just in terms of what I believe, but by using supporting citations. \n\n \nCommon knowledge and logic need no citations.\n\n That is rich. Again you are content with an arrogant belief that you just happen to be 'right' and so see no reason to prove your case. In effect, you are saying your argument is based on a 'just-so'. You believe it is true, but you've no need to show this, regardless of the fact that I've cited a half dozen sites that show that you're wrong. Irony; arrogance is something I've been accused of!\n \nHowever, in case you are not familiar with the scientific method, I did offer a summary of it from talkorigins several posts back.\n\n If you refer to post #33 you offer a summary that does not contradict what I have said.\n \nBY DEFINITION of a scientific hypothesis, your statement that [a theory relies upon other theories or hypotheses] is incorrect. This is not a matter of opinion, no matter how you look at it.\n\n I have cited talkorigins that suggests that sub-theories are used to support evolution.\n Here it is again for the selectively myopic\n \"You ask some excellent questions that are difficult to answer with a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\" As you seem rightly to perceive, \"evolutionary theory\" may be viewed as a collection of subtheories and hypotheses constantly under investigation. The idea of \"mainstream mechanisms\" hints at the answer you are seeking....The real question is, how important is punk eek in the entire structure of evolutionary theory? Scientists DO argue over the weight or relative importance of any subtheory or hypothesis when considering the whole subject.\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/feedback/may03.html\n \n I suggest you re-read your citation (where ever that is). (see Appendix A) Your side is supposed to be based on rational thinking with an inclination towards supporting evidence. You've ignored talkorigins supporting my stance.\n Here's another from talkorigins.\n \"When non-biologists talk about biological evolution they often confuse two different aspects of the definition. On the one hand there is the question of whether or not modern organisms have evolved from older ancestral organisms or whether modern species are continuing to change over time. On the other hand there are questions about the mechanism of the observed changes... how did evolution occur? Biologists consider the existence of biological evolution to be a fact. It can be demonstrated today and the historical evidence for its occurrence in the past is overwhelming. However, biologists readily admit that they are less certain of the exact mechanism of evolution; there are several theories of the mechanism of evolution\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-fact.html\n Thus they say that the construction of the theories to show evolution is correct, occurs in many different theories/sub-theories.\n \n \nI'm sorry, I don't mean to jump in,\n\n You're welcome, this is a public forum\n \nbut I did want to comment that the comment above sounds a lot like churches of today and is one of the reasons I am not religious. The sheer number of different \"ways of seeing\" the bible and the different churches, all of which have a different interpretation of everything. Why should I believe one over another?\n\n Why should you believe one version of evolution over another?\n \n \n APPENDIX A\n The scientific method.\n With some minor effort I endeavoured to track down where your un-referenced material is from.\n I found this\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/sciproof.html\n at talkorigins.\n If this is the site you used for reference to in post #33 then you're really in trouble.\n Your version of 'scientific-method' is a philosophy of science. It is prefaced by the following...\n \"What is the scientific method? This is a complex and contentious question, and the field of inquiry known as the philosophy of science is committed to illuminating the nature of the scientific method. Probably the most influential philosopher of science of the 20th century was Sir Karl Popper. Other notables are Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos, Paul Feyerabend, Paul Kitcher, A. F. Chalmers, Wesley Salmon and Bas C. van Fraassen. This is not the place to delve into an explication of the various philosophies represented by these scholars; for more information I refer you to their works and to the discussion presented by John Wilkins in his Evolution and Philosophy FAQ. I personally take an experimentalist and comparative Bayesian view of the scientific method (Salmon 1990; Mayo 1996), and this will come through in how I present the evidence for common descent.\n You are supporting your idea of scientific method by reference to a philosophical debate. That is the first problem with your supposition that your opinion is factual. The second is that it in no way contradicts a need or use of sub-theories. You maintain that it does, but it doesn't state this, and in fact the references in talkorigins implicitly linked to sub-theories state that evolution does use sub-theories to support it. The arrogant stance of \"I don't need any evidence, I'm just right\" falls apart.\n Further, it continues to state...\n \"Examination of the scientific method reveals that science involves much more than naive empiricism\", that is, it's not reliant of mere 'evidence'.",

   "Where are we up to now with this debate?\n Aside from the fact that no one is prepared to actually discuss the multi-regional theory, we've continued on with non-scientific arguments from pro-evolutionists, about evolution...\n \n Mach has debated whether my original posts were actually hypotheses, and not theories.\n \n Mach and the Bootfitter denied that evolution depends on evidence actually constructed into a workable theory; they had the idea that evolution was a 'just-so' statement supported by evidence in no lucid way to evolution; the evidence just supported evolution (hence they were intent of showing how it supported evolution by merely giving catalogues of evidence).\n \n When I stated that it rests on sub-theories/theories to show how evolution actually is, the bootfitter made a very vague reference to a talkorigins site on Scientific Method, which\n a) not only didn't refute the idea of sub-theories\n was\n b) based on a philosophy of science (influenced by Karl Popper et al).\n \n Both these posters made 'just-so' statements about their own opinions with regards to evolution. They needed no evidence because they believed they just happened to be correct. So, even when I cited a number of sites (including talkorigins) that disagree with their notions of evolution, they ignore these, because as the Bootfitter said, you can't argue with logic and common sense, it just is.\n Which is ironic since he stated (Post #35)\n \n\"In fact, I don't really care to continue addressing your comments from this post. It's fun exchanging posts with you, but sometimes it can be tiring. For whatever it's worth, my opinion is that posts are typically more effective when they have a clearly stated point and concise supporting evidence. My opinion is that too many things get lost and confused in a long post (such as this current response to you). Whaddaya say, we both make a concerted effort to keep our posts succinct and meaningful?\"\n\n \n For him, this 'evidence' means stating his opinion to support his opinion. Mach does the same thing. If he repeats it long enough, it's a 'debate.'\n \n With this type of self-deluded belief in evolution it shows why debating over evolution can be so difficult. So many people make statements about it based on their own a priori beliefs with regards what is true and what isn't. This is in fact one of the things I have claimed (evolutionist) scientists themselves do, often. They refer to something being true, having been argued already some other time, somewhere else. It is a lazy way to debate. Opinions are important, but ones not based on anything other than an opinion of what they are worth, is pointless.\n \n I reminded Mach of this on another thread, and, rather than accept this, claimed I was 'goading' him. I am interested in debate, and I could claim to be 'goaded' too, post #47 where the Bootfitter just questions my perceptions of science could be construed as 'goading'. Such as 'just-so' statement devoid of any argument can be irritating. It's an attempt to say \"you are this... I don't need to prove it, you just are...\" However, in trying to avoid this tit-for-tat accusations, if any one can actually construct an argument about evolution relying just on evidence (in no connected or workable reason/theory/hypothesis), then it would be appreciated if they step forward, and don't cite just 'common sense'; especially in light of posts #96 and #100 of this thread I evidenced my argument about evolution being based on theories or constructs of evidence.\n \n Preferably, if someone would like to discuss muli-regional theories, you're welcome to chime in.",

I presented 'evidence' to the support my statement.\n Thus\n From the thread \"Lets discuss the actual reason creationists object to evolution\" (Post #147)\n The Bootfitter has said something patently false. One was his belief that definitions don't need to be proved. There's a whole page that refutes this at...\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evo...definition.html\n Wherein they say of one group of definitions \"These definitions are simply wrong\" (Ibid). It is completely nonsensical for the Bootfitter to pronounce his definitions as definitive, and therefore don't require proof.[/quote]\n I state what the opposition said, and give a statement of argument, with backing from a site from YOUR side of the debate. And what do you now do? Question the idea of appealing to authority. (howls of laughter deleted from post) :) It's an authority from YOUR side. Sorry, I've just got to laugh again. (howls of laughter deleted from post)\n But, in actual refutation of the 'scientific method' idea, I stated post #145 to The Bootfittetr\n \n Read your own citation that you vaguely referred to. It says that there are different ideas on it, one supported by Popper. Your cite continues to list other people who have different models of scientific method/philosophies of science...\"Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos, Paul Feyerabend, Paul Kitcher, A. F. Chalmers, Wesley Salmon and Bas C. van Fraassen.\"\n You really need to read your own source. It is no wonder you gave no direct link to it, and even when you referred to it a second time, made an even more vague reference to having mentioned it some time earlier in some other post.\n This one explains two particular approaches...\n \"A. contrasts two philosophies of scientific method:\n 1. Inductive: that one begins with observation, experiment\n 2. (Deductive): that experiments are always preceded by some theory or idea (153)\n http://www.iit.edu/~schmaus/Philoso.../experiment.txt\n You can do studies on the differing scientific methods at university...\n \"In the twentieth century, &#8220;Science&#8221; and &#8220;Culture&#8221; are often presented as a dichotomy. In this class we shall be examining that dichotomy, attempting to explode it by showing that science itself has a &#8220;culture&#8221; and that science is very much embedded in culture. We shall investigate disputes within sociology and philosophies of scientific method, debates around the public role of science, and the recent criticism of science and its place in society by the powerful critiques of feminism and post-modernism. A strong emphasis will be placed on case studies and seminar presentation.\"\n http://www.registrar.dal.ca/calenda...j=ctmp&num=3000\n \n\n Thus even his own source, doesn't agree with him. \n (howls of laughter deleted from post)\n \nmaybe some posters really do need to have every single element of a debate spelled out for them in excruciating detail and 50 link essays in order to understand the very basics.\n\n Perhaps that's true. I continue to endeavour to try to educate you.\n \nHopefully for most, that isn't the case.\n Waxy\n\n You're not one of the 'most', group. Hence you make so many 'just-so' statements that if you were serious, you'd attempt to actually find evidence. Oops, that's right, what sort of person appeals to authority?
