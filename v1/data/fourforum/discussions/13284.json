But, we have to consider that we don't really know how much thought and time went into each post.\n \n Now for you Simone...\n \n \n But, as far as I can see, the only goal of the gunners is to make sure that everyone has a gun, no matter how insane, no matter how stupid, no matter how incapable they may be to own such easy-to-use instruments of death. \n\n \n Then open your eyes, Simone. This is not the case. I am willing to show you the truth of the matter if you would be willing to discuss my \"goals\" or specific laws with me. I'm even willing to excuse as mere ignorance your branding me a \"fool\" who is \"kill crazy\" and willing to dance on the grave of a victim of an alleged murder-I understand how easy and comforting it can be to blindly stereotype people. \n \n I can get past all the empty name calling and reach a true discussion with you about specific concerns you may have about guns and gun control-provided you are willing to do so. I've had substantive discussion on gun control with others on your \"side of the hill\"-and you've already demonstrated that you have plenty of spare time. \n \n What do you say?",

Mao in 1947-48? Because those freedoms directly led to the abrogation of the ultimate right -- the right to life -- for at least 30 million people. Gun control is NOT about a government trying to disarm a people so that government can be tyrannical. It is about trying to disarm people so that people cannot be. If numbers are sufficient, guns are not necessary. It took nary a shot to bring down the USSR. If 10 million Chinese (just 1% of the nation) streamed into Tiananmen Square demanding a new government (rather than the 1,000 or so who did previously), the government would have no choice but to comply.\n\n \n The Weimer Government instituted gun control in 1928 specifically to prevent the Nazis from attaining power. They failed. In 1938, Hitler extended gun control laws because they were already in power by then. So, if we learned anything from German history, it's that gun control laws don't work in preventing tyranny, but do work in preserving one once it's in power.\n \n \nIndeed, why stop there? But it's a good start. The good people of Iraq have shown us what's needed to stop a government army dead in it's tracks - mostly a combination of small arms, mortars, IEDs, the occassional RPG.\n \n Nukes? Not really useful as a defensive weapon. \n \n\n \n I'd argue that nukes are the ONLY defensive weapon. What nuclear bomb possessing country are you aware of that has been invaded by another nation?\n \n \n\n I agree, for the most part. Once you get to tanks and helicopters though? Too big, too easy a target for a tyrannical regime. Do you see the Iraqis and Afghanis using tanks and helicopters? I'm sure they could get them if they really wanted, but they're useless against a government that invests in satellite technology and bombers. Better to stick with the rocket launchers and mines.\n\n \n The Iraqis had lots of tanks under Saddam. We left most of them burning along the roadside between Kuwait and Iraq. ;) Conventional wars are easier to win that guerilla wars. \n \n \nNot to mention the 6,000,000 Jews disarmed shortly before the holocaust.\n\n \n Jews, for the most part, didn't own guns before the Nazis took over. The Weimar regime instituted it in 1928. See above.",

If 10 million Chinese (just 1% of the nation) streamed into Tiananmen Square demanding a new government (rather than the 1,000 or so who did previously), the government would have no choice but to comply.\n\n \n Interesting quote:\n \n \n Gun control is NOT about a government trying to disarm a people so that government can be tyrannical. It is about trying to disarm people so that people cannot be. \n\n \n I find this a fairly accurate summation of the goal of Hitler's \"final solution.\" \n \n Of course, Brady, you offer no evidence of how widespread individual firearm ownership became in the 5 years before Hitler \"rose to power\" when it became legal to possess firearms again. One would think that your argument would have at least considered this factor-but I won't fault you because all you have done is borrowed an un-sourced argument. \n Brady, this is just more cut and paste, this time largely from the website guninformation.org. For example, the statement \n \n \n \"Private ownership of guns was very common under Saddam Hussein's regime (source)\" \n\n \n came directly from that site. The \"(source)\" link was broken when you cut and pasted it, but when we go to your source we see it cites a newspaper article which does nothing but repeat statements of readiness by Hussein himself for the U.S. invasion, a statement from a military source that says the military has stockpiled weapons, and interviews with three Iraqi citizens (the last of which did not give his name because he was \"unaccompanied\"-meaning this last one was interviewed without a government agent standing with the reporter to make sure the man said what he was supposed to say). Do you have any more information Brady, or is it all anecdotal \"we're ready if you guys invade us\" propaganda? How about a true survey or some statistical evidence? Present that and I will then address the differences in how private gun ownership did not prevent tyranny in Iraq. \n \n As for the example you cite of Nazi Germany, I note again what you cut and pasted provides no sources for anything it says. However, if you want a very comprehensive review of German firearm laws, practices, and the behavior of the German government in regards to firearm ownership both before and during Hitler's rule, then it can be found here: \n \n http://www.stephenhalbrook.com/article-nazilaw.pdf\n \n This article addresses every point you raise, Brady. \n \n Now if that proves too long or difficult a read, then consider that perhaps the best proof of whether Hitler believed gun control was necessary to ensure the domination of potentially unwilling subjects comes from the mouth of the man himself:\n \n \"The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty. So let's not have any native militia or native police. German troops alone will bear the sole responsibility for the maintenance of law and order throughout the occupied Russian territories, and a system of military strong-points must be evolved to cover the entire occupied country.\" Adolf Hitler, dinner talk on April 11, 1942, quoted in Hitler's Table Talk 1941-44: His Private Conversations, Second Edition (1973), Pg. 425-426.\n \n But we don't have to go to Europe to see how gun control was used selectively for population control-we have three shameful examples in our own back yard. The prohibition against black slaves having arms, and the laws denying arms to newly freed slaves after the Civil War are one example. The denial of the RKBA to Japanese Americans interned during WWII is another. The final example would be discrimination against Native Americans owning guns which did not finally end until 1979. \n \n If you want sources for these examples then step up and ask me.\n \n I'm willing to discuss Cambodia, Mainland China, Iraq, Nazi Germany, and any other historical issue involving gun control with you, Brady. All I ask is that you stop running from me and answer my questions in return. \n \n You could start with telling me how your claim of a rise in police deaths occurred after the AW ban expired is not a lie, or, if that's too difficult, then how about giving me some examples of the \"many\" anti gun quotes of the founders you claim exist (this time perhaps picking someone who was at least old enough to be potty trained when the BoR was adopted). \n \n \nWhen the boogeyman goes to bed, he checks his closet for Chuck Norris. \n\n \n Ethmi, that's classic! We needed a little levity in this thread. How about this one:\n \n \"When Brady goes to bed, he checks his closet for me.\"\n \n Run, Brady, Run!",

That is not to say that only those people are the militia either!\n \n Can you name one successful government that has ever won a guerrilla war?

Despite the claims of pro-gun activists, gun ownership did nothing to stop a tyrant like Hitler from seizing power.\n \n \n Hitler seized power and disarmed all opposition and brainwashed the Hitler Youth into being snitches for his coming regieme, like every tyrant before him did. He also made use of criminals much like the czars of the Romonov regieme and later tyrannical governments. Old Senator Sam Nunn used the Hitler law which is almost word for word in the 1968 GCA here in the U.S.A. \n \n \nOther paranoid voices argue that the citizens should arm themselves against their own government.\n\n \n So you think the Constitution is \"paranoid\" huh? You need to read the Federalist and anti- Federalist papers and quotes from our FF.\n \n \nSometimes they point to Waco or Ruby Ridge as examples, usually failing to note that it was precisely people arming themselves against government that attracted the government's attention in the first place. The US Government knows it's history -- it knows that Mao Tse-Tung, Pol Pot, and even Hitler started out as leader of a small group of lunatics who had easy access to firearms. They used their guns to intimidate people, and thus gain power.\n\n \n No comparison at all. The victims of both Ruby Ridge and Waco were primarily scare tactics such as you post here to demonize gun owners. Both of these travesties were instigated by \"a small group of lunatics\" in the government to gain more power and increase their funding. Lon Hourchi was indicted but never tried by a jury because of 'lack of money' by the State so it claimed in the Ruby Ridge slaughter. Waco was a Clinton/Reno diversion which originally started by a hyped up claim of \"child cruelty\" which the federal government had no jurisdiction over to begin with. I don't plan to entertain your non justifieable claims to the contrary to rehash old lies by our own government and sponsored by the likes of your kind.\n \n \nWould you have supported the \"freedom\" for Hitler and his cronies to own guns in 1932?

Gun control is NOT about a government trying to disarm a people so that government can be tyrannical.\n\n \n You couldn't make an association like this to save your life. Hitler gained power by deception much like what is happening now. The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (google it) puts to rest any claim you have made about Hitler. He did disarm Jews, Gypsies and others he was afraid of because they did not support him. He also had some weird features you share like torturing and burning helpless creatures! People cannot be tyrannical by definition. Check it out! Your claim is dismissed for want of cause and no true stated claim.\n \n \nIt is about trying to disarm people so that people cannot be.\n\n \n It is not NOBLE to eliminate nor diminish a right in the BOR. You spin more propaganda. Even the current administration admits the Right to Keep and Bear Arms applies to the States.\n \n \nIf numbers are sufficient, guns are not necessary.\n\n \n Wouldn't the same apply even if people were armed? Every tyrant in history has used disarmament of the people so they couldn't resist. The truth is, if only 3% of gun owners opposed the government it would be more than all the troops currently active and you would have to go to great lengths to assume that \"all\" the military would stay loyal to an unConstitutional regiem.\n \n \nIt took nary a shot to bring down the USSR.

   "Your guesses are not facts!\n\n \n Your 'fact' that the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising was in 1928 shows you know nothing about it.\n \n Anyone who can condone what happened here is pure evil:\n The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, by Marek Edelman\n \n snippet: \n Now the events began moving at a breath-taking pace. The ghetto streets became a bloody slaughter-house. The Germans made it a habit to shoot passers-by without the slightest provocation. People were afraid to leave their homes, but German bullets reached them through the windows. There were days when the toll of terror was 10-15 quite accidental victims. One of the more notorious sadists, a Schutzpolizei gendarme by the name of Frankenstein, had on his conscience over 300 people murdered in one month, more than half of whom were children. \n \n Simultaneously man-hunts were being conducted on the streets by German and Jewish Police. The captives were sent to various labour camps throughout the General Government. The Germans gained doubly from that procedure: first, they obtained the needed working power; secondly, they were able to show that all evictions were caused by the Germans' desire to \"increase the productive power\", and that in German labour camps, even though the conditions were difficult, one had an opportunity to live through the war... The Germans were truly magnanimous. They even permitted the people to write to their families... \n \n These letters found their way to the ghetto in great numbers and their result was disbelief of the more and more persistent reports concerning mass executions of Jews. Repeated deportations throughout the country, allegedly to Bessarabia, passed almost unnoticed, because the ghetto obstinately believed the rumours that letters had arrived from these people also. Likewise, people dismissed as untrue the story of the wholesale slaughter of almost the entire transport of German Jews brought the previous year to the vicinity of Lublin. The stories about the executions in the Lublin woods were too horrible, it was thought, to be true.\n *******************************************************\n \n They simply had nothing to lose. Read the rest from a survivor's prospective.\n \n brady, if you condone this you sure are in the right .org Must make you tingle to see places like Waco where women and children were burned alive and/or shot.

Most of them didnt even have guns so they couldnt be disarmed! \n A more farfetched question is the hypothetical proposition of armed Jewish resistance. First, they were not commonly armed even prior to the 1928 Law. \n\n \n In which case you would have to agree they were unarmed and unable to offer armed resistance to Hitler's tyranny--casting serious doubt on your implication that Germans as a whole were well armed when Hitler rose to power.\n \n Of course, you may have been trying to say that Aryan Germans were well armed while Jews and others were not. But you won't allow yourself to make this argument because it would highlight yet another example of how gun control was used as a tool of racist oppression-in this case being a means to the end you unwitting cited in an earlier cut and paste:\n \n \nGun control is NOT about a government trying to disarm a people so that government can be tyrannical. It is about trying to disarm people so that people cannot be. \n\n \n I agree with you Brady.

All that matters is that these law abiding citizens who were denied the right to defend their families their friends and their right to life with a firearm were rounded up and killed in one of the most physically sickening ways imaginable. They were denied basic human rights and had to watch everybody their knew die because of their religion with NO way to defend themselves.\n \n This to me is the most important fact. If every Jewish person was given the right to own firearms for self defence sure some of them would have died but 5 to 6 million armed citizens uprising against the tyrannical resigm would sure as hell overthrown the Nazi resigm and prevented millions of deaths not only Jewish deaths but possibley would have prevented many Deaths from both sides of the war.",

Because those freedoms directly led to the abrogation of the ultimate right -- the right to life -- for at least 30 million people. Gun control is NOT about a government trying to disarm a people so that government can be tyrannical. It is about trying to disarm people so that people cannot be. If numbers are sufficient, guns are not necessary. It took nary a shot to bring down the USSR.

   "Well now this should be fun. Afterall you're resurrecting a thread that's been effectively dead since late 2009. You could've simply quoted Brady and created a new thread to suggest to get the same message across. But instead you chose to take this course of action. So let's begin.\n \n \nI think that's correct.\n\n \n I disagree, both with the message you choose to quote, and with your belief that's it's correct.\n \n For starters you chose to quote the ramblings of Brady who tried to cite prostitutes to prove a position of his as being correct and got called out for doing such. In his quoted message Brady talks about \"the freedom for Hitler and his cronies to own guns in 1932.\" The problem with whatever parallel Brady tries to draw here is his missing of the fact that Hitler, the Nazi party and the soldiers of Germany were all government affiliated in some way, either due to direct possession within the German government, or they were closely tied to those who had clout with authority.\n \n No government is required to rely on constitutional permission to be armed for purposes of war and enforcing standards within the bounds of their country. Government has always had the authority to arm the military with various forms of weaponry regardless of whatever prohibitions they might place of the people of the nation. This is true no matter where you look. Take America for example and how soldiers in World War Two had free access to machine guns despite the National Firearms Act of 1934 restricting said machine guns to civilians during the same time frame. The military didn't need to undergo the rigorous paperwork requirements to acquire Thompson submachine guns and M3 grease guns or 30mm mortars.\n \n Whatever intellectual dishonesty Brady tried to engage in won't be tolerated. Nor will we allow it to be purported as it's a perversion of the truth and facts.\n \n Now onto the next part of the discrediting process.\n \n \nLook what has happened in the Middle East in the past few months. People in Egypt and Tunisia have gotten rid of dictators without an armed rebellion. In the 1980s, Koreans got rid of a US supported dictator and South Korea became a democracy. No guns were needed. If tens of millions of unarmed Americans started protesting in the streets and refusing to obey laws the US government would be forced to change. What else could the government do? The police would not have the manpower and resources to stop a mass protest like that.\n\n \n Your argument is incredibly naive in nature. The incidents that took place in Cairo could hardly be considered peaceful in nature. After the government basically shut down the internet in direct response to protesters using facebook to coordinate their attacks there was much rioting and violence taking place. The level of violence seen in Cairo alone was comparable to what took place during the Los Angeles Riots and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The situation degraded quickly and warranted the military deploying tanks in direct response.\n \n Let me repeat that in case it wasn't caught the first time. The military deployed tanks in response to the protesters!\n \n Simply because armed rebellions weren't needed in these cited examples you mention doesn't mean that's the norm of events.

   "Yep, an old thread from '09. star gazer keeps pace real well :)\n \n I don't suppose he noticed the hypocrisy of his own words with OUR government ordering a citizen, a former elected Senator to \"not own a gun\"...? If they can order you not to exercise this inalienable right, what is to keep them from forbidding you to not protest nor petition your government? Pietro was almost there and what else could they forbid you to not do like post on the internet or drive cars or grow gardens or whatever?\n \n Yep, and your solution is to protest. I agree with Pietro! The mass protests were ignored over the jelly healthcare bill. We got protests going on now in at least two States over union crud and the government workers are saying, \"raise taxes on business and let them pay for us\" then they will cry to high heaven for price controls because hamburgers went up $1.00. Sheer lunacy while inflation is also hitting everyone they want to be immune by spiraling benefits and wages. Wars have been fought for less. Gov't workers, paid by tax money are the wrong people who should be protesting.\n \n Don't you agree star gazer? emoticon_xangel",

   "Well now this should be fun. Afterall you're resurrecting a thread that's been effectively dead since late 2009. You could've simply quoted Brady and created a new thread to suggest to get the same message across. But instead you chose to take this course of action. So let's begin.\n \n I disagree, both with the message you choose to quote, and with your belief that's it's correct.\n \n For starters you chose to quote the ramblings of Brady who tried to cite prostitutes to prove a position of his as being correct and got called out for doing such. In his quoted message Brady talks about \"the freedom for Hitler and his cronies to own guns in 1932.\" The problem with whatever parallel Brady tries to draw here is his missing of the fact that Hitler, the Nazi party and the soldiers of Germany were all government affiliated in some way, either due to direct possession within the German government, or they were closely tied to those who had clout with authority.\n \n No government is required to rely on constitutional permission to be armed for purposes of war and enforcing standards within the bounds of their country. Government has always had the authority to arm the military with various forms of weaponry regardless of whatever prohibitions they might place of the people of the nation. This is true no matter where you look. Take America for example and how soldiers in World War Two had free access to machine guns despite the National Firearms Act of 1934 restricting said machine guns to civilians during the same time frame. The military didn't need to undergo the rigorous paperwork requirements to acquire Thompson submachine guns and M3 grease guns or 30mm mortars.\n \n Whatever intellectual dishonesty Brady tried to engage in won't be tolerated. Nor will we allow it to be purported as it's a perversion of the truth and facts.\n \n Now onto the next part of the discrediting process.\n \n Your argument is incredibly naive in nature. The incidents that took place in Cairo could hardly be considered peaceful in nature. After the government basically shut down the internet in direct response to protesters using facebook to coordinate their attacks there was much rioting and violence taking place. The level of violence seen in Cairo alone was comparable to what took place during the Los Angeles Riots and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The situation degraded quickly and warranted the military deploying tanks in direct response.\n \n Let me repeat that in case it wasn't caught the first time. The military deployed tanks in response to the protesters!\n \n Simply because armed rebellions weren't needed in these cited examples you mention doesn't mean that's the norm of events. After all you have accused others of cherry picking when they present examples of gun ownership saving lives and stopping crime. Therefore I'm accusing you of cherry picking for citing these two isolated events.\n \n There's no guarantee that mass protesting of government policy in America would end peacefully even if we fell out in the millions. There was much protest against the passage of the Obamacare bill but it was signed into law anyway in direct opposition of the will of the majority of the American people.\n \n And then you have the audacity to ask what the US government could do when faced with such numbers except change to fit the will of the people. You have a disturbing lack of imagination if you actually believe your own question. Do you actually believe those secret detention facilities and the various black ops programs wouldn't be used against the American people in the name of fighting \"home grown terrorism\" as the government would term it?\n \n I can't find the link at the moment but some time ago during the Bush administration there was a memo from the Department of Homeland Security released to the various law enforcement agencies and warned them to be cautious of, amongst other groups, advocates for closing the border between Mexico and America, abortion opponents, military veterans, government detractors, and many other groups. And groups like these can number in the millions. That hardly suggests the government is powerless to do anything other than cave in and comply with the demands of the people.\n \n What could the government do should an amassed group of 10 million American citizens stand up and declare they will no longer obey the law or recognize the authority of the government? You really don't want to know the answer to that.\n\n You post a lot but it doesn't seem like you make much of an actual argument. The Nazis were not always government affiliated. They started out as a private group. And who claimed that government needed permission to prepare for war? But I don't see what point you're trying to make with all this other than this being part of an ad hominem attack on another poster. Next you make a big deal about tanks being deployed in Cairo and you seem to want to pretend that this refutes my argument. Then you accuse me a cherry picking. If you have actual evidence that I'm cherry picking why don't you bother to give examples that contradict my argument? The last part of your post is pure speculation and at the very least your speculation is no better than mine.",

I've lost count of the number of times you've made argument after argument all of which boil down to the exact same message: the Supreme Court was wrong in their ruling in the Heller case and again in the McDonald case; that there's no historic evidence to suggest that the Second Amendment was designed to protect the lawful use of firearms in a manner unconnected with serving in a government controlled and organized militia.\n \n This has been your argument over and over again. You continue to cite whoever supposedly supports your argument despite the number of times you're rebuked and proven wrong. When you're confronted with the evidence of your mistaken belief you either pretend it was never presented in the first place or you leave the discussion entirely only to surface in another thread citing another supposed \"expert\" who shares your views, only to be proven wrong again and the process is repeated from the beginning yet again. No matter how many times everybody proves that you're wrong you continue to make the same crusade of an argument.\n \n You've claimed that you wanted a debate about gun control. We have yet to see any such debate open up. We've even offered you opportunities to have such a debate and you've been strangely silent.\n \n \nMost of your posts don't even come close to doing that.

But you've done nothing to show that this is the case. I'd like to see a few examples of what you claim are shortcomings on my part to address the points you raise.\n \n If you wish for me to address shortcomings in my posting style then it would be very helpful if you have specific examples to cite, rather then vague generalizations that are left un-cited.\n \n \n\"Gun control, the Law on Firearms and Ammunition, was introduced to Germany in 1928 under the Weimar regime (there was no Right to Arms in the Constitution of 1919) in large part to disarm the nascent private armies, e.g. the Nazi SA (aka 'the brownshirts').\" \n GunCite: The Myth of Nazi Gun Control\n\n \n Suppose for a minute that this is actually true. That under then-current gun control laws of Germany the Nazi party was lawfully rendered unarmed and unable to present a threat to the government. If that's the truth then how exactly did Hitler gain control of the government and institute the Holocaust if he wasn't able to mount an armed rebellion in the first place?\n \n And if this was achieved then I believe that puts a number of holes in the post of Brady's that you chose to quote when you resurrected this thread.\n \n \nI think it's intellectually dishonest of you to pretend that you've proven someone wrong about a point they made when really you've haven't.\n \n \n Isn't that the pot calling the kettle black. You claim intellectual dishonesty, when you continue arguing that the Supreme Court is wrong simply because you can find some supposed historian who abuses his position and title for political agenda.\n \n \nBut they started out as private citizens with access to guns. Either address that point or shut up. I don't think anyone claimed that a RKBA enabled people like Mao and Hitler to do horrible things once they had already attained power. You go off on a wild straw man of your own creation.\n \n \n Then what exactly is the reasoning for you quoting Brady's message regarding \"The freedom for Hitler and his cronies to own guns in 1932\"?\n \n \nNo claim was made that no protesters would be killed only that a protest involving unarmed people (if the numbers were sufficient) could succeed in getting rid of a dictator as happened in Egypt. Again, you seem to have a hard time addressing the point actually being made.\n\n \n And you have a hard time addressing the point that various governments have engaged in the murder of protesters before. You asked the question of \"what other choice would government have except to change when confronted by large numbers of protesters?\" and I pointed out the obvious: start killing them or use violence and force against them in response.\n \n You don't seem willing to face the facts of reality. These protesters in the examples you cite were exceedingly lucky that they weren't relocated to mass graves for their actions. They're the exception rather than the rule. The likelihood of unarmed subjects being successful in overturning a corrupt and tyrannical dictatorship are incredibly slim.\n \n If you were trying to hope that the example of the success in Cairo could be used as grounds for suggesting that we have no need to own guns in the event we need to overthrow a dictatorship then you're sorely disappointed. Dictators don't care about public opinion or popularity with the people, that's why they're dictators. If they want to have you and your family killed then they will. They might even have your bodies dragged through the streets to serve as an example of what will happen to those that oppose them.\n \n I say it again. These protesters in Cairo were exceedingly lucky that things turned out the way they did. They're the exception rather than the rule, the million to one shot you hear about happening but likely will never encounter yourself in your own life. The odds of their success being replicated in other country, under another dictatorship are unlikely at best.\n \n \nAnd how practical would it be to detain tens of millions of unarmed Americans in these \"secret detention facilities\"? Sounds like you're desperately grasping for straws.\n\n \n Exactly how practical is it for the federal government to maintain a no fly list of hundreds of thousands of names that apply to millions of innocent Americans? How practical is it to monitor various groups for their beliefs that run contrary to the policies of government officials? What exactly is the practicality of advising the police to be wary of war veterans because they might pose a potential security threat?",

   "the gun crazies wet dream: their guns will defend them from a tyrant. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n You never did answer my question Winston Smith. Exactly how have you made the determination of mental status based on how someone exercises their constitutional rights? What qualifies you to be making such a determination?\n \n Explain your contempt for \"constitution crazies.\"\n \n \nIn the first place by definition a tyrant is in control of the population and that means doc jones and co. have had their toys removed by then.\n\n \n Where should I even begin by tearing this falsehood apart?\n \n For what you say to even be possible of happening the government would first need a centralized registry database to be in place, and then they would have to mandate under severe penalty of law that every gun be registered; two things that government lacks the authority to do. Even if government chose to disregard the law and try to enact such a registry it would be unenforceable as they lack the ability to actually enforce it. With the number of guns that have been bought from private dealers it would be an impossible mission to try and get them all registered. There's simply not enough manpower to go door to door and carry out warrantless searches to determine if they have any unregistered guns in hiding. Or they could report them as stolen and break whatever paper trail you might try and form, making the weapon untraceable and in the process forcing the authorities to waste limited resources in looking for something that doesn't exist.\n \n The government lacks the authority and the resources to enact such a registration program for keeping tabs on people. That makes confiscation extremely difficult to pull off, so any hopeful tyrant is going to find themselves fighting an uphill battle just to disarm the people.\n \n \nIn any case what chance would a bunch of disorganized mentally retarded loonies have against the National Guard and/or the Armed Forces? \n\n \n Firstly I object to being called mentally retarded simply because I believe in the constitution. Are you going to start insulting book owners next?\n \n Secondly your own ignorance of history is frightening. Have you ever heard of the Battle of Mogadishu and the mission to capture the warlord Mohammad Farah Aidid? A deployment of 160 military members was overwhelmed and forced to retreat when faced with opposition in the form of 4,000 drug addicts. They forced the highly trained Delta and Ranger forces back through sheer numbers and brutality.\n \n And then we come to the current mess in Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and anywhere else our troops are deployed in the name of the war on terrorism. Our troops are being killed by IEDs and outdated weaponry by an enemy that's effectively invisible and superior in numbers.\n \n Approximately one third of the nation is armed. That's nearly 100 million people being in possession of at least one gun. The entire armed forces division doesn't come anywhere close to that number. Plus we have more weaponry than we do. We have hunting rifles that will not only kill a moose but punch through standard issue body armor without issue from long distances away.\n \n Add to the fact that various members of the armed forces and national guard have stated that they would disregard any order to engage in war about American citizens on their own soil. We would likely have those people as supporters on our side. The citizenry movement could be bolstered by military deserters who brought their standard issue weaponry with them, just like the drug cartels down in Mexico. Not to mention all the retired military members who actively train the public in techniques and tactics.\n \n \nThe moment the tanks rolled out in the streets and choppers circled above, they would s** in their pants and would try to flush their guns down the loo\n\n \n Should the government feel it necessary to deploy tanks and helicopters to engage in urban combat, say in a highly urbanized city packed with millions and people and the potential for countless innocent bystanders being shot, the entire country might very well revolt against the government because they feel betrayed. There are simply too many people in the big cities to open up any kind of hostile actions against them in the name of combating insurrectionists and guerrilla soldiers. Such a move would be suicide on the part of the government. We're a nation of 300 million people. You really don't want to take a risk and anger 300 million people.\n \n And then there's the fact that the government is broke. They have no money to pay for a war against the people. The economy hasn't been kind. They're incapable of paying the salaries of the soldiers for such a deployment. And good luck trying to get our troops to kill their own neighbors and friends and not pay them for it. Such a move could cause the entire armed forces division to revolt.\n \n So back to your original question. What could we do against the government? Win.",

Look what has happened in the Middle East in the past few months. People in Egypt and Tunisia have gotten rid of dictators without an armed rebellion. In the 1980s, Koreans got rid of a US supported dictator and South Korea became a democracy. No guns were needed. If tens of millions of unarmed Americans started protesting in the streets and refusing to obey laws the US government would be forced to change. What else could the government do? The police would not have the manpower and resources to stop a mass protest like that.\n\n \n Right there you were jumping to conclusions about the protests and riots that took place in Cairo. You claimed that the people had no need for arms during this time. But as we're seeing they were very much in need of arms because they were being beaten by the police and subjected to various degrees of torture. And then when suddenly there's evidence to the contrary and you're asking to explain this discrepancy you claim that you have no desire to jump to any conclusions and how more information is supposedly needed to form an opinion. You didn't seem to need additional information before taking the stance that an armed American populace wouldn't be necessary for defeating a dictator.",
