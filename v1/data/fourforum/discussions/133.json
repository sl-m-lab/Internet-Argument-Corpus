   "there are so many different theories about how WWII could have been prevented, but i think that they can be boiled down to three main ones:\n \n 1. Treaty of Versailles (1919): the treaty that ended WWI was very very harsh on the Germans. it blamed Germany for the entire war (even though it was the Austrian's fault) and punished the hell outta them. we have France to blame for this unfair treaty. if the Treaty of Versailles had not been so harsh, Hitler may never have been able to rise to power in the same way that he did.\n \n 2. League of Nations: this is a controversial issue. if the united states had joined the League of Nations, it would have been undoubtably a lot stronger. but could it have been effective? i dont think there is anyway to know for sure. but it wouldnt have done any harm.\n \n 3. Appeasement: the European nations (particularly Great Britain under Chamberlain) let Hitler conquer whatever he wanted and made little effort to stop him at all. when Hitler found out that he could have basically any eastern european nation he wanted, he did not hesitate at all. the best example of appeasement was at the Munich Conference when Hitler promised not to invade Czechoslovakia but he did anyway. when Hitler invaded Poland, that was the last straw. unfortunately, it was too late.",

The republic is our last hope.\n\n \n Germany, France, and Russia may not all be pro-America, but Russia and France and Germany don't even really get along with each other. Throw China and Japan and India into the mix along with possibly Israel, Pakistan, and maybe Canada or Mexico, and you have such a string of strange political relations that it would be difficult to actually produce a threat to any given nation without hurting your own beyond repair. Having the US move away from being isolationists and making them more interlinked with the world is a good way of promoting peace in my opinion. As long as we depend on Europe and Russia and both of them depend on us, then it would be daft for us to go to war with each other. Globalization is creating a period of stability right now and I think as the rest of the world become more interlinked there will be more unity.\n \n However I do believe you have something when you say that if the US does meet its end there would be global chaos. I can picture China invading Taiwan, North and South Korea going to war, India and Pakistan duking it out, and Russia trying make war against the EU. Fortunately we would still have our allies, the Atlantic and the Pacific defending us here, but the rest of the world would be a mess if the US just suddenly fell apart.\n \n The English speaking nations really are sticking together. The threats are the EU, Russia, and China. I am more suspect of Russia and China than I am of the EU. Those two both have way less to lose than the EU does and they are far more organized even if they are in a more backwards state of technology. EU has too many cultures, too many languages, and too many differences in opinion to really mesh. Russia has a lot of bad blood with the US and EU and China doesn't trust either Russia, EU, or US at all. Plus China is getting sick of waiting to get Taiwan back.\n \n But if we are starting to look at WWIII, perhaps we should begin asking ourselves can WWIII be prevented? It may be taking shape right in front of our eyes and we don't even see it. You are looking at the fall of the US by militia or a foreign power which I think would bring about mass chaos. I'm looking more at an international conflict not involving the US to begin the next wave of major worldwide combat. The US has very patriotic citizens, a powerful military, and a lot of cash and international power. Put that together and I don't think you will see our nation getting divided by anything other than a VERY powerful alliance. I don't see the militia being powerful enough by any means although they could cause some chaos.",

   "Given the nature of war during that period it is a fact WWII should not have lasted more than six months. The nature of blitz creige provides a clear model for all future wars and it is clear the pentagon model there desert warfare tactics on Erwin Rommel the greatest leader of armoured devisions in histrory.\n \n The political model of Great Britain had a lot to do with the length of WWII. The British political model is open to weakness and indesision. It is amazing to think the westminster system could have sustained the worlds largest empire. It is a fact the westminster system was almost its undoing. Inoreder to preserve peace one must threaten war. Peace at all costs is never a option. Also one should not be overly concerned with saving face. Hitler used deciet and subtifuge to his advantage. He was not concerned what others thought of him as a gentelman. \n \n If one intends on Declareing War One should already be attacking. The british declared war on germany for the sole perpose of saving face. They did not defend poland and never intended to. This is a example of weak subtifuge. Hitler had striped the fortafacations along the Sigfread Line and bavaria was open and undefended during the 4 weeks of the polish war. Three heavily armoured spearheads one targeting Berlin and the other two supporting the flanks would have ended that war in under three mounths. The british would have needed to intergrate the RAF under the direct comand of the expaditionary force and use bomber camand as first wave of distruction preceiding a majior armoured asult useing the lighting war tactics. Not taking risks only leads to futher loss of life. This is the nature of war.\n \n The greatest US General of all time was Pattern. If Pattern were the President at the time WWII would have not lasted very long and there would have been no cold war. Pattern new the real enemy was Starlin and would have loved dearly to given the Russians a lesson in blitz Creige. For what ever reason The US did not for see the Attack on Pearl Harbour. This is an outrage. The attack should have been forseen and a premptive strike launched. The oppertunity to take out a sizeable part of the Emporers Fleat would not occur until the Battle for Guada canal. This was a grave cost for the US. One must always reserve the right to first strike.\n \n In the same way ICBMs repace airforces today, air power replaced Naval power in WWII. The shift towards armoured war and air power was for seen by young visionaries. These young mylitary men were very agressive tacticans and given positions of power in the Axsis forces. These men created the blitz criege. The allied forces still employed the old gaurd from WWI it is for this reason the war was so one sided in 39 40 and 41. It took time for the US to put aggresive tacticians such as Pattern into the front. Allied losses were still a majior concern to the politcal forces running the allied effort. This was a majior mistake. The gemans also mastered the art of terrorism as a perfect extension of propaganda. The allied responce was slopy and unguided. The germans used terrorism to clog up enemy lines with fleeing civilians and put down uprisings in occupied terrortories. The Allied firebombing of Axsis cities has been proven to have surved no tactical advantage. It may have even hardened german resolve. It is clear politicans do not understand the concept of Total War. Revenge is not a good reason for terrorism.",

   "Could someone explain this whole art school thing in a little more detail, I know that basics, but I want to know more.\n\n \n If you are curious, read Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler. What better than to go to the source. It covers it in the first chapters about his desire to go to art school, and more importantly his fathers push to have him go to a life of public service. It is an interesting book, in which he describes his plans for the fatherland (germany). Hitlers motivations for the war stemmed from his belief that the Aryan's were the one true great race, and that in order for the Aryan's to gain their rightful place in the world once again (they were believed to be the descendents of the knights of old that dominated Europe during the dark ages), they needed to get rid of impurities in the genetic pool (the final solution to the jewish question). The book, written by Hitler and published October 16th 1924 while he was in Landsberg Em Lech Fortress Prison could have served as a foreshadowing of what was to come. It is said that if much of the german population had read the book when it was written, or it's ideals had been published widely throughout Germany, WWII might never have happened. The book forecasts the German policy during WWII very accurately. Hitler only came to power by hiding these ideals and beliefs from the people and promissing them a better life, a return to the germany of old. It was not until he was in power that he began to unfold his plan. By then, there was nobody able to stop him from within. And even so, few Germans knew of the atrocities perpetrated by the Nazi's until much later in the war, by that time much of the damage had been done. Anyway, If you are interested, Hitler was rejected from art school twice. He was told upon the second rejection that he was completely unfit to be a painter, and that he should persue a career in acrhitecture. The only problem being that Hitler did not graduate from Realschule (primary school), and had not attended building school at the Technik, which prevented his admittance to architecture school.",

I didn't even consider the idea that one of the reason for the Cold War never would have occurred if not for WWII. Still I'm not convinced that communism and capitalism wouldn't have still been on a collision course led by Russia and the US respectively. The Cold War perhaps could have become a conventional war the likes of WWII between Russia and the US. It may have even ended similarly to WWII with nuclear weapons.",

   "there are so many different theories about how WWII could have been prevented, but i think that they can be boiled down to three main ones:\n \n 1. Treaty of Versailles (1919): the treaty that ended WWI was very very harsh on the Germans. it blamed Germany for the entire war (even though it was the Austrian's fault) and punished the hell outta them. we have France to blame for this unfair treaty. if the Treaty of Versailles had not been so harsh, Hitler may never have been able to rise to power in the same way that he did.\n \n 2. League of Nations: this is a controversial issue. if the united states had joined the League of Nations, it would have been undoubtably a lot stronger. but could it have been effective? i dont think there is anyway to know for sure. but it wouldnt have done any harm.\n \n 3. Appeasement: the European nations (particularly Great Britain under Chamberlain) let Hitler conquer whatever he wanted and made little effort to stop him at all. when Hitler found out that he could have basically any eastern european nation he wanted, he did not hesitate at all. the best example of appeasement was at the Munich Conference when Hitler promised not to invade Czechoslovakia but he did anyway. when Hitler invaded Poland, that was the last straw. unfortunately, it was too late.\n\n \n I think that WWII would never have happened if Germany hadn't been made to pay back war damages and thus cause them hyperinflation and worse after WWI. It left the door open for someone like Hitler to come to power by causing great resentment and hatred towards the Allies. \n \n All this changed after WWII, the German people were treated with respect and the Allies helped to rebuild their country. The Allies had learned their lesson. It's been around 60 years and no trouble from Germany. In fact they are a valued member of the world community. \n \n What I'm saying is that you will get a more real and lasting peace with kindness and respect than you will with force and brutality.",

Germany's industrial leaders initially began rebuilding their broken economy in a conventional manner using outside investment capital, much of it from private and corporate US sources, with Hitler's charisma as the beacon to attract outside investors and the common citizen. Once Hitler won the first public election, questionable, his power and that of his inner-circle dominated industrial growth using fear, which was directed toward military expansion, the fastest way to provide internal growth in a false economy. Germany's international trade credit was soon curtailed as Europe reacted in fear to the military entity Hitler was assembling. Germany became, for all practical purposes, an isolationist nation with immense appetites for raw materials and labor to fuel its war machine which were obtainable in neighboring countries but with no credit or trade agreements to acquire them. At that point, Hitler and his inner-circle held total power over Germany with a police state grip and there was no turning back.
