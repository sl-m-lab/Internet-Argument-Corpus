   "I have a question about the measurement of lightspeed, which typically involves the use of mirrors to reflect a beam to its source-point.\n \n The problem with such means, is that it makes multiple assumptions that are inconsistent with one another: chiefly that the beam moves at equal speed in all directions, and also that a \"Lorenztian transformation\" will not account for these differences. \n \n A reflection is also a \"source,\" and therefore an independently moving source will lag or lead the beam according to its motion relative to inertia-- which likewise coincides with its speed relative to the center of mass of the physical universe (UCM), which logically correlates to the universal point of origin or \"UPO\" (i.e. the site of the \"Big Bang\").\n \n I would like to know if any experiments have measured lightspeed unidirectionally in order to verify current theories; if not, then differences in lightspeed could account for the motion of the Earth in the universe relative to this UPO, and thus create a \"cosmic map\" of the universe, and the place of the earth in it. This could likewise precisely calculate the net mass and kinetic energy of the universe, and thereby determine not only the past but the future of it, as well as general physical principles which vary in accordance with such.",

I suspect I quite know what other things...\n \n Anyway: they got it right, or at least as right as we can get it right. So right, as a matter of fact, that GPS is actually accurate.

Anyway, let the bozo tell you something: you come out with a ridiculously loaded question like that, be prepared to be ridiculed.\n \n Anyway, I did answer. There are no mistakes that would indicate what you are pointing at with your post. We have c down so right, that we can get locations down to meters or less in a system, the scope of which is thousands of kilometres. As in, GPS satellites in orbit, and by measuring the differences between received signal times we can calculate the location on the surface. With c at 300000km/s order of magnitude, and the distances at at most thousands of kilometres (6371 km radius of the planet itself), and accuracy of measurement at metres, you can see that the measurements already are amazingly accurate.\n \n Anyway, if you can wiki, then do wiki and first learn enough on the subject to phrase your question so that it can be decoded by content, not tone.\n \n \n \n \nThe problem with such means, is that it makes multiple assumptions that are inconsistent with one another: chiefly that the beam moves at equal speed in all directions, and also that a \"Lorenztian transformation\" will not account for these differences.\n \n\n \n Amazingly, we are able to do highly complex operations, like turning the experiment mechanism around, to see if we are getting things wrong :)",

   "Personally, I preferred your pre-edit comparison to Einstein over W[e]isenheimer, sarcasm notwithstanding.\n \n The wiki doesn't need to be state of the art. The experiments and theories that you are contesting have been considered fairly fundamental for the last 50-100 years or so. I agree that Hubble Redshift was a poor choice of analogy - but that's because at least part of the redshift is not due to (relativistic) doppler effects, so moot point. You mention 'independently moving sources' in your OP, and then go for 'fixed sources' later - my 'inconsistency' is due to yours, nothing more. Oh, and incidentally, I graduated from Warwick University last year with a degree in physics, and am now teaching science at the 11-18 age range.\n \n You have to resort to grammar-nazism to further your case.
