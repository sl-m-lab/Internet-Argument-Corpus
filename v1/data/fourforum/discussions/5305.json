In this spirit of open debate and discussion, I'd just like to say that it's a pity you weren't aborted, because the best part of you ran down the crack of your mother's XXX when you were born. I can only hope that you're put down some day.\n \n If you guys want to accuse us of indiscriminate slaughter, then you might want to check what those terms mean.

We would carpet bomb your homes, poison your food and water, and shoot you on sight.\n \n You won't reason with us, and you can't beat us, and so one day you'd wake up, get dragged out of your house, raped, and then shot in the back of your head in front of your wife and children before they're executed in their turn.\n \n But we won't do that, because that would be wrong. \n \n And you know what the best part is? You're complicate in every abortion that you don't prevent. While you sit here jawing about those mean old liberals, babies are being killed and there isn't a single damned thing you can do about it because you aren't willing to do anything about it.

Further I am inclined to BELIEVE (that is to say, I have no actual figures) that less than 10 percent of the abortions meet the \"health of the mother\" criteria which leaves 90+% getting abortions simply because they can't be bothered with whatever issues that a child would bring. Wah..Wah.. Wah..... emoticon_cry My parents met the challenge. I met the challenge...Kids aren't always \"timely\" and convenient...tough noogies....Just my opinion.\n \n Even if we COULD stop just half of those convenience abortions, imagine how many healthy babies we could have realized and the possible futures ahead of them. Sure, some might have been difficult but I'll choose life over any of the problems facing it. That's what I would do if it were me. But I do not feel any authority to dictate that others do what I think is right.
