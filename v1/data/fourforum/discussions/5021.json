Assuming that Clinton used all that money like any good president would and suddenly Clintons budget surplus of $ 230 billion in FY2000 turns into $ 54 billion.",

Once the books were cooked, it became a matter of fact for succeeding administrations to enthusiastically follow that line of reasoning. At his point, $150-billion a year of 'surplus' SS funds are being used to supplement government spending and reduce reported deficits. Right now, if one uses conventional double entry bookkeeping, there's a loss of $150-million on the trust side and understated annual deficit of $150-billion. \n \n For those who like numbers, the government projected deficit for 2005 is roughly $500-billion. Add $150-billion of SS money and $100-billion for Iraq to total $750-billion. On a $2.6-trillion budget, that's 29% of budget we don't really have combined with a declining tax base. Sound fiscal policy. \n \n Surplus has numerous definitions, depending on which numbers one cares to include or exclude. Look at table 3 to understand what pulling SS trust revenue (now called social insurance) would do total revenue (this chart also displays severe personal and corporate tax declines, an oddity withpublicized 'robust' GDP growth heh, heh):\n \n http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=1821&sequence=0",

Low interest rates were accompanied by a steadily declining tax base, 20% on the personal side since the current administration took office. There's no indication of the tax base increasing, quite the opposite with failed tax cuts, which will make higher interest rates combined with ongoing deficits a cash flow issue 800lb gorilla.",
