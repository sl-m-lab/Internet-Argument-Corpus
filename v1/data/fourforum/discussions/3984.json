Why do Christians use crosses as their symbol?\n \n They also usually think of the cross as a symbol of peace and salvation, but it was the tool of murder. It just doesn't make sense to me.\n\n \n To answer your first paragraph question \"Why would the religious symbol be the thing his murderers used to kill him?\" The cross was not a religious symbol at the time. It was used as an instrument of extreme torture. It was the most extreme torture Romans used and its use for execution was reserved for the worst and poorest and most despised. \n \n My view as to why christians use it is similar to JP's. It is what is stands for. Jesus, was innocent (the bible states this). His accusers had no witnesses. The jews of the time were not allowed to execute by proclamation of Ceaser. They brought him to Pilate. Pilate said he would let him go if Jesus would answer. Jesus did not answer. Pilate said, don't you know I have the power of life and death over you. Jesus answered that he would not have that power had God not given him that power. \n \n Jesus voluntarily went to this death. He knew it was coming and accepted it. The bible says it was his love for you and I that motivated him. The cross symbolizes a love that is unimagineable. You or I might willingly die for a close friend who is a good person. Jesus chose to die for those who were not good people and who hated him, his enemies. That is the kind of love the cross symbolizes. That is why I would wear a cross.",

Why do Christians use crosses as their symbol?\n \n They also usually think of the cross as a symbol of peace and salvation, but it was the tool of murder. It just doesn't make sense to me.\n\n As with many of the Christian elements and symbols the cross goes deeper than what appears on the surface. The cross is a paradox, a \"collision of opposites.\"* (literally and figuratively) It is \"the paradox of the impotence of omnipotence and the hopelessness of the hope of the world.\"**\n \n It is a \"tool of murder\" at the same time it is a tool of salvation. It is where Jesus became weak to become strong (to put a spin on Paul's description of his own trials). It is where hate was absorbed and not returned (as is the usual reaction) and then transformed into love.* It is where the King of Kings suffered the death of the lowest serf and criminal. But this was the greatest act of humility he could have shown. In this greatest act of humility was the greatest act of love. \"For there is no greater love than a man give up his life for another.\" As Jesus told us about the greatest love, he also practiced what he preached, being the ultimate preacher. Because he preached it as something to follow, the crucifixion does not stay distant and remote as a simple, past tense, historical fact for believers. It rather becomes a perpetual reminder and an encouragement to us to take up our own cross in showing this love for others. It is a reminder to \"be obedient unto death\" as was Jesus.\n \n So \"It is true, and even tautological, to say that the cross is the crux of the whole matter.\" For \"the timber of that terrible tree was the death of God and the life of man.\"***\n \n *Father Richard Rohr\n \n **G.K. Chesterton in The Way of the Cross A Commentary by Gilbert Keith Chesterton\n \n ***G.K. Chesterton in The Everlasting Man",
