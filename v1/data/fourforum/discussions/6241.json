   "GRINGO", 
   "When I say that George Bush is the biggest threat to America, I mean his actions will cause the political breakup of the country (official or not) and the destruction or irrelevance of our governing bodies, plus a Constitution that is no longer the supreme law of the land.\n \n Illegal immigration is the key to everything bad that's about to happen to America. To start with, if Bush had chosen to close our border with Mexico early on in his administration and evict illegals, criminals first, and put in place a sane immigration policy, the Mexican/American separatist movement would have been dealt a serious setback.\n \n These Reconquista separatists were not taken seriously at first. Most people probably never heard of them. They are covered in the local media in California and adjoining states but, until recently (for example, CNN, FOX,MSNBC), they \"somehow\" failed to make it nationally.\n \n In the last fifteen years the movement has caught on with millions of illegal aliens from Mexico, Mexican/Americans, and the Mexican government. Large crowds of Chicanos, children included, can appear quickly, carrying banners and Mexican flags, ready to demonstrate, sometimes with violence against American patriots protesting against the invasion from Mexico. Every person living in California or the American Southwest knows the word reconquista. The invasion is real and the Chicanos, as well as the Mexican government, led by Vicente Fox, is confident of victory. Both are doing their part. And our government, led by George Bush, is doing nothing but giving aid and comfort to the invaders (enemy).\n \n Jose Angel Gutierrez, radical Professor of Political Science, University of Texas, Arlington, spoke of the new breed of Chicano: ...\"These folks want it all. They want to recreate all of Mexico and join all of Mexico into one. And they are going to do that, even if it's just demographically... They are going to have political sovereignty over the Southwest (U.S.) and many parts of the midwest.\" [Illegal Immigration, thesigintreport.com]\n \n Massive immigration to America, while supplying the separatist movement with voters, is also helping to relieve the huge unemployment problem in Mexico and provides much needed cash which is sent back to relatives in Mexico.\n \n Illegal Mexican immigrants are now spreading out across America, to the Midwest, to the South (Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, the Carolinas and up the East Coast). Immigrants find a place to settle down, get work (illegally) or go on welfare. They contact relatives, who then make the trip to join them. Any child born to an illegal is automatically granted citizenship and the family, seldom deported, receives welfare benefits. This happens around 300,000 times a year. The population explodes and like many towns in the Western United States, especially California, they become Mexican towns, with a Mexican \"culture\", and Spanish as the primary language.\n \n Meanwhile, their political power grows. In a few decades, when the Chicanos control the Southwest U.S., every presidential race will be decided there. In addition, all Mexicans who become American citizens and their children are entitled to dual citizenship with Mexico, courtesy of Vicente Fox. The new \"Americans\", of course, will have a pro-Mexican influence on foreign policy. \n \n A recent Pew poll found that over 40 percent of Mexican adults ...\" would move to the U.S. if they could, and 1 in 5 say they would do so illegally if necessary. 'A third of Mexican college graduates say they would come because of better economic opportunities. And over 50 percent of Mexicans would ...\"be inclined to come if the U.S. established a TEMPORARY WORKER PROGRAM.\" No problem.\n \n As we know, Bush has no intention of stopping illegal immigration, despite the wishes of the vast majority of Americans. The reason was announced on March 23, 2005, when he, President Fox of Mexico, and Prime Minister Paul Martin of Canada agreed to establish a Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (a North American Community), slated to be in place by 2010 and open borders is an important part of it. Like the European Union, it requires free movement of people, commerce, etc. throughout the member states.\n \n Open borders is also essential for the even larger economic and political community about to be forced on American citizens without their knowledge of consent. The European nations were at least given the chance to vote on the proposed union. But Bush is pushing his plans forward quietly in an attempt to destroy the sovereignty of the United States one step at a time, an end run around the Constitution. Bills are presented to Congress and talked up as free trade agreements among the nations signing on. They are, in fact, lengthy documents that contain many rules and regulations which take power from the member states and transfer them to unelected bureaucrats working in the interests of mutinational corporations. Disputes among the member states of NAFTA, the WTO, and businesses are decided by international tribunals, tribunals whose authority also applies to CAFTA and the next nail in America's coffin, the FTAA.\n \n NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement), CAFTA (Central American Free Trade Agreement) and the final draft of the FTAA (Free Trade Area of the Americas) are all steps toward the goal of building a megastate, stretching from Alaska to Tierra Del Fuego. It will consist of 34 nations in the Western Hemisphere, regulated by a supranational government similar to the European Union.\n \n According to Henry Lamb, the FTAA ...\"will swallow up both NAFTA and CAFTA, and, quite literally, much of the U.S. Constitution.\" \n \n Article 4.2 of Chapter II of the final draft agreement clearly states who is in charge: \"The Parties (all member states) shall ensure that their laws, regulations, and administrative procedures are consistent with the obligations of this Agreement. The rights and obligations under this agreement are the same for all the parties, whether Federal or unitary States, including the different levels and branches of government...\"\n \n These regulations, as written in the FTAA, are binding on every citizen and organization of this megastate. A government could evolve into something similar to the European Union, which has a European Parliament and a Council of the EU, two law-making bodies whose laws are THE LAW for every citizen of the EU.\n \n The end of America as we know it would not happen, even at this late hour, if congressmen and women who care would read the FTAA agreement. They would see that this is a blueprint for a supranational government, complete with open borders and a loss of national sovereignty. They would also see that much of their law-making authority will be usurped by a higher power.\n \n This, of course, does not include those elected officials, some, members of the Council on Foreign Relations, who are fully aware of the deception being committed against the American people by the current administration. Many of the media corporations and their employees are also members or support the implementation of plans to destroy the sovereign state. You don't seem to hear much about these agreements from the print and broadcast media, do you? \n \n Lamb refers to OUR GLOBAL NEIGHBORHOOD, a 1995 report of the U.N.-funded Commission on Global Governance. It says that ...\"the concept of national sovereignty must be revised.'\n \n \"It is time to think about self-determination in the emerging context of a global neighborhood rather than the traditional context of a world of separate states.\" That means sovereign equality, each nation having equal sovereign authority- \"under a common, or collective, supreme authority.\" [http//www.newswithviews.com/Lamb/henry95.htm]\n \n Bush I, Clinton, and Bush II have all been on board for the New World Order, Globalization, and the destruction of the sovereign nation. George Bush took office with this plan in mind, the people be damned. Although many have been involved in these acts of treason, history will \"honor\" George Bush if he succeeds in his quest. \n \n We must now be prepared (maybe) for the mobility of businesses, factories, and people (the cheapest labor available throughout the hemisphere) to any member nation without obstruction from government at any level. A beautiful scenario, a homogenized culture of workers trying to make a living wherever they can and a ruling elite, living the dream.\n \n A graduating high school senior in the year 2000, when asked what his concerns were for the new century, replied: \"There's nothing left to believe in.\" Yes, indeed.\n \n A question. Aren't our soldiers fighting and dying in Iraq in order to close the borders to terrorists and to preserve the territorial integrity of that nation?",
