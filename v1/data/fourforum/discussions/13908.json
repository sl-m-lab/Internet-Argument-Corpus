The passages supposedly condemning homosexuality are more than a little ambiguous, and have to be read in context, they speak to specific same sex behaviours, associated with pagan religious practices, and of a time when everyone was married (and hence same sex activity would be adulterous). They do not speak to committed, life long monogamous relationships. Sodom and Gommoragh is another matter:\n \"'Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy\" - Ezekiel 16:49",

   "So, I'm Christian. That's already been established.\n\n \n So am I. Hello.\n \n \nBut, my question is one on homosexuality.\n\n \n Ok. For the record I'm a Gay Christian.\n \n \n \n \nIn the bible, GOD clearly states that Homosexuality (I'm just going to call it HS from now on) is wrong. He states that He made man for woman and vice versa. After all, He did destroy Sodom and Gomorrah for these very reasons, did he not (For the sake of staying on topic, I am begging, on my knees mind you, all of the atheist to just let the last comment slide and not debate that)?\n\n \n Actually God destroyed S and G based upon in hospitality. And from a creation stand point during the time of Jewish culture when Leviticus was written, the point of maintaining procreation was paramount to the very survival of Israel as a nation.\n \n See they believed that all life was contained in the male's sperm and that such anything outside of procreation for cultural and practical reasons was intolerable.\n \n Also, many pagan religions at the time and nations used the act of homosexuality as a means of false worship to another god for fertility or even various crop gods. This in the eyes of the Jewish people was an act of idolatry.\n \n There simply were no monogamous Gay relationships or people in the ancient world from the time of Moses to the time of Paul.... Soulforce.org is an excellent resource into looking into such an issue.\n \n \n \n \nBut, what I'm really asking is, is it OK to hold my position with the gay.\n\n \n It is your position. Your heart. I applaud that you are asking questions because you care deeply about your friends. Hopefully the link I provided will better help you in understanding what your gay friends face....\n \n \nI'm not saying that I have a problem with people being gay. In fact, I respect that. But, my deal is that I have a lot of gay friends, and, I'm like \"It's not my life, it's yours, and so what right do I have to tell you how to live it? Mean words, yelling, and silence is not going to do anything to change your mind, so I'm not even going to try\". Now, I don't agree with them being gay, but I don't mind it...\n\n \n That's fine. yet you must understand and I assume you know just by being around them that being gay does not revolve around sexuality or the act. In fact it would be foolish to define your friends based only upon what they do behind closed doors.\n \n Gays are not one dimensional and not one dynamic as you know. What people attempt to do is to rationalize through ignorance the judging of others through only they wish to see. A filter if you will....\n \n I'm sure that you personally see your friends more than just by their sexuality. And I know they see you not based upon your sexuality but by you as a person.\n \n \nDoes that make any sense?\n\n \n \n Certainly.\n \n \nAnyway, as a Christian, does it say anywhere in the bible, or by our morals, that I am not to maintain this opinion? And, if so, then why?\n\n \n The bible teaches to love unconditionally. You may not be accepting of their sexuality ever or for a very long time. But that comes with greater insight and time and a stirring of the heart.\n \n You just need to provide the one thing your friends have been denied many times by other people. Unbiased unconditional non judging love. You have no idea how long many of us have been starved of such a thing...\n \n \nDidn't He tell us to accept all and love our neighbors like we would love ourselves?\n\n \n Jesus did. He also loves and embraces gays just as much as Straits. \n \n \nI know it might sound like I'm defending the Pro-HS side of this, but, I'm not. Or, in a way I am, but then again, I'm not.\n\n \n You are conflicting feelings. You are trying to stay rooted in what you feel is traditional when it is stigma coupled with faith. I am not in anyway trying to accuse you of being narrow minded or such but it is being ignorant of the truth behind the scriptures, and ignorant of the plight gays have faced...\n \n \n \n \nI don't know if that makes any sense.\n\n \n It makes sense. You have a good heart and want to love your friends. Keep doing that please they need that...\n \n \nAnyway, once more, can anyone tell me what I should do? Or why I'm right or wrong?emoticon_love\n\n \n You are not wrong and there is nothing I can say more. Your friends need someone who will love them for who they are not what they are if you take my meaning.\n \n I am Gay. I'm also a Musician, a student, a veteran, I love Jazz, model trains, laughing, movies, etc. There is such a broader dynamic to me than just my sexuality.\n \n People need to see this when their around gay people. What I do behind closed doors when the time comes with my partner is my business alone and his.\n \n But I do not define or have my life revolve around it. You need to visit the link I provided and read what the bible says. You may not agree with it fully which is understandable, but given your heart I see that you care enough to seek truth and insight....\n \n Also youtube \"for the bible tells me so.\" it is a very non biased powerful insight into the lives of faith based families with gay children.... Very moving, very touching and very vivid in how close to home it hits... \n \n Don't be afraid to ask questions and if you have anything else more personal to ask just message me.",

Of course christians should be accepting of all people equally and not judge or condemn them every time we meet them in a social setting. I debate issues here on line and give my honest opinion based on my scriptural based values, this brings out the anger and rage of the homosexuals who seek to silence any opposing perspectives or opinions in any venue, even on a debate forum which exists for the sole purpose of sharing ones opinions and beliefs on any issue raised. \n \n But let's not treat the real world as we do here since people we meet in life did not sign up to be debated or berated about how the bible deems their lifestyle to be sinful. We are to love them and show compassion and acceptance for them as children of God. We must pray for them and realize that every human being is a fallen creature in need of reconciliation with God through Christ, not just homosexuals. \n \n If the issue comes up and your opinion is sought, I would give it honestly but would phrase it to say that just as God hates adultery by a straight man and woman, so does he hate homosexual sex between two men or two women. This puts the focus on sin rather than placing a unique stigma on homosexuals as if they are some extra bad type of sinners. Because they are NOT. They are sinners just like the rest of us are sinners in need of salvation through Christ Jesus. \n \n I could say more here, like it's the homosexuals who take it upon themselves to force who they are on us in our daily lives as they condemn us for daring to share our beliefs on debate forums like this. So don't allow them to intimidate you and just love them in the real world but share your honest opinions here.",

It doesn't matter how conciliatory I am even on a debate forum, if we don't fully accept what homosexuality represents in all of its abomination, we are seen as a hater by the proponent and defender of this sexual sin. \n \n Here's the difference between straight sinners like adulterers and fornicators as compared to your militant homosexuals like JJ here. You wont ever find an organized group of adulterers or fornicators made up of millions of people who march in parades and protest seeking social acceptance of sins they commit in private.\n \n It is only the homosexual lifestyle and community which has gay pride parades and protests in marches and sues for the universal acceptance of their sinful lifestyle as they fight against the very God people like jason claims to be a believer in.

Check this site out for what is being taught to kids in a state where gay marriage has been legalized. http://www.massresistance.org/ You see Jo, once marriage is legally redefined, then the law allows for it to be taught to our young as right and normal.

The fact is though that people on the Right are held to moral standards where no such standards exist on the left. You mention Clinton for some stupid reason because even he refused to admit to or take responsibility for his sin of adultery until the blue dress showed up with his semen on it, and he never had the character to resign to save the country of the ensuing humiliation of what our President was and is as a whoremonger and a liar.

Those same southerners who took flight from the dems over segregation went straight over to the Republican \"southern strategy\", where they reside to this day. Why do you think all the southern states suddenly went red? It's because the democrats abandonded segregation and the republicans started talking up \"states' rights\" as code for segregation. And yes, Christians did a lot of fighting for black equality, but it was the Christian left, not the Christian right.\n\n \n Where does that judge say that as a committed christian he believes this way? Oh wait, he doesn't say it anywhere. But just because he mentions God, you assume he must be a right wing born again believer. Remember, the KKK quoted the bible also, but I have nothing in common with them either. \n \n And you think that the Republicans are pro segregation? Why don't you post a link from an objective site supporting that ridiculous assertion, Jo? Go on, prove that is in any way true if you can. You live thousands of miles from the US, are a citizen of another country yet you have the nerve to debate our culture and history as if you have any first hand knowledge of it at all?\n \n All you know is the rewritten history you have learned from the left wing sources you read instead of the word of God.

   "So, I'm Christian. That's already been established.\n \n But, my question is one on homosexuality.\n \n \n \n In the bible, GOD clearly states that Homosexuality (I'm just going to call it HS from now on) is wrong. He states that He made man for woman and vice versa. After all, He did destroy Sodom and Gomorrah for these very reasons, did he not (For the sake of staying on topic, I am begging, on my knees mind you, all of the atheist to just let the last comment slide and not debate that)?\n \n But, what I'm really asking is, is it OK to hold my position with the gay.\n \n I'm not saying that I have a problem with people being gay. In fact, I respect that. But, my deal is that I have a lot of gay friends, and, I'm like \"It's not my life, it's yours, and so what right do I have to tell you how to live it? Mean words, yelling, and silence is not going to do anything to change your mind, so I'm not even going to try\". Now, I don't agree with them being gay, but I don't mind it...\n \n Does that make any sense?\n \n Anyway, as a Christian, does it say anywhere in the bible, or by our morals, that I am not to maintain this opinion? And, if so, then why?\n \n Didn't He tell us to accept all and love our neighbors like we would love ourselves?\n \n I know it might sound like I'm defending the Pro-HS side of this, but, I'm not. Or, in a way I am, but then again, I'm not.\n \n I don't know if that makes any sense.\n \n Anyway, once more, can anyone tell me what I should do? Or why I'm right or wrong?emoticon_love\n\n \n I believe in the Golden Rule. I have gay friends and have a couple of (not immediate) family members who are uh...guy thinks he is a girl and girl thinks she's a guy....they are brother and sister. Mother was very, very domineering, etc.\n \n God did not create Adam and Steve. Regardless of the leftist spin, scripture tells us that homosexuality is wrong, period. We can argue definitions all day, but it is clear what Paul intended.\n \n I am not going to judge a person for such, but I will not hesitate to make my views known. Salvation is your own, what you make of it is your responsibility. NO one will be able to spin the issue when they stand before the judgment seat of Christ. Christian's can indicate a biblical view, and be vilified for it. That's ok, your salvation is your own. Make of it what you want.\n \n It's ironical that some of those arguing here 'what scripture says' about homosexuality don't even believe in scripture in the first place.",

   "All Archie can supply is bluster. Again. Oh, and personal attacks and insults.\n\n No again Jo; Archie supplied facts which refuted your apologetic diatribe which once again opposes the righteous and principled values of the Right in favor of defending the secular left and the homosexual ethic. You are a hypocrite who doesn't have a clue about what a true believer is.\n \nReally? Check this site out for what is being taught to kids in a state where gay marriage has been legalized. MassResistance! You see Jo, once marriage is legally redefined, then the law allows for it to be taught to our young as right and normal. That is why the gay agenda wont settle for civil unions which gives them all of the rights of marriage, they insist on marriage itself in order to redefine it for the rest of us.\n \n Ah, so you admit that it isn't being convicted anymore. Once again your accusation was fallacious just as I pointed out above. And again, why do you find being identified with homosexuals as being personally attacked or insulted? It makes no sense since you defend the lifestyle so readily. \n \n That's because you didn't look cuz it doesn't serve your purpose. In fact the adultery laws have been enforced more recently than the sodomy laws. Here, in 2003 a man in Virginia was convicted of it, and it still is used regularly in divorce proceedings. FindLaw's Writ - Grossman: Punishing Adultery in Virginia\n \n Sure you are condemning Newt as if we on the Right have double standards or no standards at all where they apply to our own. The fact is though that people on the Right are held to moral standards where no such standards exist on the left. You mention Clinton for some stupid reason because even he refused to admit to or take responsibility for his sin of adultery until the blue dress showed up with his semen on it, and he never had the character to resign to save the country of the ensuing humiliation of what our President was and is as a whoremonger and a liar. To this day he can't practice law since he is a convicted perjurer. But none of this means anything to you who is an apologist for sin and sinners as you betray any moral principles reflected in Gods word\n \n Where does that judge say that as a committed christian he believes this way?

You are deluded and have been sold a bill of goods and lies which you sop up like a pig in a poke. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n \nThis may or may not be true, I have no idea what is required reading in what grades in american schools today. But just for the sake of conversation, let's assume you're right, does the teacher accompany that book with a lesson plan which teaches that adultery, fornication and hence, family break ups are right and good for our society? If not, then of what value is your example since it is the epitome of a fallacious example. \n \n For a guy who claims to be married, you think and argue just like a militant homosexual who is on a mission to defend his own lifestyle. You rely on the same weak and pathetic arguments which are slanted and biased to the point of being lies. \n \n As for the illegality of adultery and premarital sex, show me where homosexual sex is being prosecuted in America today, if you can. \n \n As for Newt Gingrich's sin's, didn't he resign as speaker of the house and not run for office again because of the condemnation he received from his own party for his infidelity? Now let's look at someone I'm sure you must consider some kind of hero in your warped and small mind, Barney Frank, who's male prostitute boyfriend was caught selling himself out of Barney's Capital Hill Apartment. That escapade took place in the 90s yet here is an unrepentant Barney still serving in a political party which has no moral values to speak of at all. You double minded hypocrite!!! You dare to condemn Newt when you have Barney as just one example of Democrats refusal to take responsibility for their blatant sins even when they are caught red handed?\n \n Again you lie and distort history as you blame conservative christians for the bigotry of democrats and southern racists. It was the Republican MINORITY Party which had a stronger civil rights act submitted in Congress when under extensive pressure from the Northern States, LBJ finally caved in and signed a much weaker civil rights act submitted by the Democrats so they could lay claim to passing it as the majority party. Just so you know, it was christians in the North who fought for black equality, not against it so stop distorting American history.\n",

You don't think that God foresaw bicycles or keyboards before He created Adam as He did? Our creativity as human beings came as some surprise to Him which He never saw coming? Then you don't believe God is omnipotent and omnipresent? WOW, you're the first believer who possesses His Holy Spirit I have ever known who doesn't believe that God possesses those attributes. I mean, since I know God indwells me via His Holy Spirit I have first hand evidence that He is everywhere at once, including within me personally.

It's about what God says in His word and what His character is shown to be, by Him, in that word. You cheapen God and call Him a liar when you ignore the passages Easy quoted above which condemn same gender sex. You imply that God didn't mean what He said or wasn't smart enough to speak his mind accurately. \n \n You prove in this post of yours that you don't have a clue about Gods design in creating us with foreknowledge of precisely how we would advance in our fallen state. If God didn't foresee homosexuality, He wouldn't have written the passages warning against it in His handbook for us, you know, the bible? \n \n Here's what I mean regarding how either dishonest or deluded you must be in order to ignore and oppose these OT passages regarding homosexuality. \n \n Here below are the verses from Leviticus which we know is the book of Levitical Laws which God laid down to FIRST keep His people separate from the godless pagans who inhabited the lands through which the Jewish people had to travel to reach the Promised Land. And He also warned them not to adopt the sexual practices of the people whose land He was taking them to, and I will prove that is the proper context of this book of laws.\n Leviticus 18:22 - \"Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.\" \n \n Leviticus 20:13 - \"If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.\"\n \n Now, here is the opening verses of Leviticus, it is as plain as the nose on your face as to what Gods motivation is for giving it to Moses, and that is to warn and inform the Jewish people NOT to participate in or practice the sins of the flesh which were rampant in Egypt where they lived or in Canaan where He was taking them. He was covering the culture of their past and their future practices. So the argument from your side that God wasn't forward looking is bunk, as usual.\n Lev 18:1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n Lev 18:2 \"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'I am the LORD your God.\n Lev 18:3 'You shall not do what is done in the land of Egypt where you lived, nor are you to do what is done in the land of Canaan where I am bringing you; you shall not walk in their statutes.\n Lev 18:4 'You are to perform My judgments and keep My statutes, to live in accord with them; I am the LORD your God.\n Lev 18:5 'So you shall keep My statutes and My judgments, by which a man may live if he does them; I am the LORD.",

I mean, did God ever say that monogamous homosexuality is a good thing, anywhere? If so, please quote the passage if you will and we can clear this whole debate up right now. And on a side note; \n \n To the objective observers: Here is the MO of the homosexual agenda which your response will prove, to always attempt to destroy the character of the opposition because you can't attack the truth of our accusations and arguments which define what your community represents, and ultimately, that is that your sexual proclivities are unnatural, self destructive and an abomination to the God whom you personally claim to be committed to. \n \n The relevant question is Jason, how do you rectify that contradiction regarding your alleged salvation experience? And why do you believe that I must repent of my sins, which means turn away from them, but you don't have to repent your sins, or turn away from them in your salvation experience? That is after all my only argument against your claim of being saved. I have argued that homosexuals can be saved just as straights can be ad infinitum, around here. What I dispute with each and every homosexual is that you can be saved without actually turning away from your predominant sin when I did and had to turn away from mine in order to make a full, real and complete commitment to my Lord, Jesus Christ when I received His Holy Spirit to dwell within me.",

Abomination means ritually unclean, not morally reprehensible. \n\n \n The prohibitions against homosexuality in Leviticus 18 and 20 appear alongside other sexual sins-adultery and incest, for example-which are forbidden in both Old and New Testaments, completely apart from the Levitical codes. Scriptural references to these sexual practices, both before and after Leviticus, show God's displeasure with them whether or not any ceremony or idolatry is involved.\n \n Despite the contention that the word for abomination (toevah) is usually associated with idolatry, it in fact appears in Proverbs 6:16-19 in connection with sins having nothing to do with idolatry or pagan ceremony:\n \n There are six things the LORD hates, seven that are detestable [an abomination or toevah] to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil, a false witness who pours out lies and a man who stirs up dissension among brothers. \n \n \n If the practices in Leviticus 18 and 20 are condemned only because of their association with idolatry, then it logically follows they would be permissible if they were committed apart from idolatry. That would mean incest, adultery, bestiality and child sacrifice (all of which are listed in these chapters) are only condemned when associated with idolatry; otherwise, they are allowable.

   "Think about the context of the passages, not just the words. They were part of the holiness code. Abomination means ritually unclean, not morally reprehensible. And if you think everything in the law of Moses was directly dictated by God, then why did Jesus say that the laws on unclean food did not apply? No, God gave the ten commandments, he did not dictate every law in the pentateuch. This is the Bible we're talking about, not the Q'uran, it's authors are not mindless automatons, they are fallible humans inspired by God. The law of Moses was about separating Jews from Gentiles, setting the Shibboleths if you will, and avoiding paganism. In Jewish society everyone was married, so any same sex relationships would be adulterous, and the only places they saw same sex activities were in the context of pagan religion.\n \n I don't doubt that God foresaw many uses for hands and mouths, I was pointing out the absurdity of your argument from intention. How do you explain the placement of the prostate, for example?\n\n \n \nReally? It can't mean both? Because according to the Lexicon it does mean both. But unlike you, rather than just make the claim I will support it with an unquestionable spiritual source. Blue Letter Bible - Lexicon\n \n WOW, so now you are qualified to determine which passages apply and which ones don't in Gods word, right? And just like the secularist you confuse the application of Gods word in the Age of the Law and the Age of Grace which Jesus ushered in. \n \n Again, REALLY? Where does it say in the OT that every Jew must marry? And on what scriptures do you base that claim? And how do you determine which verses, laws and principles in Gods word are inspired by Him and which ones are human inspired corruptions of His word? Your own personal moral preferences is the answer to that question which is why I insist that you're a homosexual posing as a believer since you just defend it as you attempt to reinterpret what the bible says to satisfy your homosexual preferences.\n \n I don't, and I don't have to. You see Jo, I am a child of God, not God who created Man in His image. I have no idea why He designed us as He did, but I believe that because He is the eternal God of all time and space that He knows what He is doing, and that He created us perfectly according to His knowledge and wisdom.\n \n Here is a passage in Revelation which is speaking about the song Moses and the Lamb regarding Gods marvelous works which we are, in a future event. I guess this is just more man made tripe since too, huh? You can't see that the New Testament is merely an extension of the Old Testament and inspired in its entirety by the same God who is perfectly consistent in all way imagined and unimagined by your small mind. emoticon_xdonno \n Rev 15:3 And they sang the song of Moses, the bond-servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, \"Great and marvelous are Your works, O Lord God, the Almighty; Righteous and true are Your ways, King of the nations!\n\n \n \nThe way we determine which laws are applicable is to look at which are compatible with what Jesus taught.

Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\" God refers to homosexuality as unnatural lusts for the same gender.\n \n Here: Leviticus 18:22 - \"Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.\"  He refers to it as detestable/an abomination, morally repugnant and a perversion no matter how you cut it.

   "What I find incredulous is that you modern perverters of Gods word have taken to the tactic of interpreting Gods very clear condemnation of same gender sex to interpreting those passages as speaking to monogamy as if that was the issue He was concerned about. I mean, did God ever say that monogamous homosexuality is a good thing, anywhere? If so, please quote the passage if you will and we can clear this whole debate up right now. And on a side note; \n\n \n You know Archie I would probably answer your question but I honestly don't care. I mean even now you put in little jabs and prods in your posts to already put me on the defensive, and your quack of a boyfriend Easy has really gone off the deep end with his obsession with scat...\n \n Oh and where in the bible did God condemn monogamous homosexuality? Aha a clue Sherlock....\n \n \nTo the objective observers: Here is the MO of the homosexual agenda which your response will prove, to always attempt to destroy the character of the opposition because you can't attack the truth of our accusations and arguments which define what your community represents, and ultimately, that is that your sexual proclivities are unnatural, self destructive and an abomination to the God whom you personally claim to be committed to. \n\n \n Unnatural, self destructive, and abominable got it... Ted go ahead and run this in the Dobson and Phelps bi weekly crazy letter I'm sure all the nutcases will eat this up like candy....\n \n \n \nThe relevant question is Jason, how do you rectify that contradiction regarding your alleged salvation experience? And why do you believe that I must repent of my sins, which means turn away from them, but you don't have to repent your sins, or turn away from them in your salvation experience? That is after all my only argument against your claim of being saved. I have argued that homosexuals can be saved just as straights can be ad infinitum, around here. What I dispute with each and every homosexual is that you can be saved without actually turning away from your predominant sin when I did and had to turn away from mine in order to make a full, real and complete commitment to my Lord, Jesus Christ when I received His Holy Spirit to dwell within me.\n\n \n Archie you know for as long as your posts are there really isn't any substance to them.\n \n I never told you to repent I said your methods of attempting to win people over to Christ are detrimental and self destructive to what their actual objective is....\n \n \n But personally I really think you and Easy don't want to save people or win them over to Christ. I really believe that both of you hate gays lefties, and who ever else so much that you just use religion as a platform to go to town....\n \n God will judge your true motives not me. And frankly I don't really care what you say at this point and neither does all but maybe two people on this forum either....",

   "\n \n I am really interested in seeing your spin of the above Leviticus 18:22, looks like you ignored it in your last response.\n\n \n I'll spin it like a DJ buddy here we go.....\n \n What the Bible Says - And Doesn't Say - About Homosexuality\n \n \n PASSAGE 3\n LEVITICUS 18:22 AND 20:13\n THE HOLINESS CODE\n \n Let's move on. What do the two verses sometimes cited from Leviticus say about God?\n \n Leviticus 18:6 reads: \"You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female. It is an abomination.\" A similar verse occurs two chapters later, in Leviticus 20:13: \"A man who sleeps with another man is an abomination and should be executed.\" On the surface, these words could leave you feeling rather uneasy, especially if you are gay. But just below the surface is the deeper truth about God -- and it has nothing to do with sex.\n \n Leviticus is a holiness code written 3,000 years ago. This code includes many of the outdated sexual laws we mentioned earlier, and a lot more. It also includes prohibitions against round haircuts, tattoos, working on the Sabbath, wearing garments of mixed fabrics, eating pork or shellfish, getting your fortune told, and even playing with the skin of a pig. (There goes football!)\n \n So what's a holiness code? It's a list of behaviors that people of faith find offensive in a certain place and time. In this case, the code was written for priests only, and its primary intent was to set the priests of Israel over and against priests of other cultures.\n \n At the age of 10, I signed a holiness code written by the Women's Christian Temperance Union that said I would never taste beer, wine, or liquor. I thought signing it would please God and my grandmother. That's a holiness code. When I was in high school we evangelical Christians had an unwritten holiness code that went like this: \"I don't drink, smoke, or chew, or go with girls who do.\" Now I know what you're thinking. That last part about \"girls who do\" proved especially easy for me. But the point is that I obeyed this evangelical holiness code because my parents said that breaking these rules didn't please God, and I knew it didn't please them.\n \n We had another evangelical holiness code while I was in high school that prohibited dancing. I was student body president, yet I refused to go to the prom because I had promised not to dance. I did this to please God and my mother -- whose mother had made her sign a holiness code that she wouldn't go to dances either.\n \n What about this word abomination that comes up in both passages? In Hebrew, \"abominations\" (TO'EBAH) are behaviors that people in a certain time and place consider tasteless or offensive. To the Jews an abomination was not a law, not something evil like rape or murder forbidden by the Ten Commandments. It was a common behavior by non-Jews that Jews thought was displeasing to God.\n \n Jesus and Paul both said the holiness code in Leviticus does not pertain to Christian believers. Nevertheless, there are still people who pull the two verses about men sleeping together from this ancient holiness code to say that the Bible seems to condemn homosexuality.\n \n But wait, before we go any further, let's ask: What does this text say about God? Even if the old holiness codes no longer apply to us as Christians, it's important to remember that in every age, people of faith are responsible for setting moral and ethical standards that honor God. But we people of faith must be very careful not to allow our own prejudices to determine what those standards should be.\n \n Instead of selecting one item from an ancient Jewish holiness code and using it to condemn sexual or gender minorities, let's talk together about setting sexual standards that please God -- standards appropriate for heterosexuals and homosexuals alike, standards based on loving concern, health, and wholeness for ourselves and for others.\n \n Now what do the Leviticus passages say about homosexuality?\n \n I'm convinced those passages say nothing about homosexuality as we understand it today. Here's why. Consider this single Bible passage that was used for centuries to condemn masturbation:\n \n \"He spilled his seed on the ground... And the thing which Onan did displeased the Lord: wherefore he slew him also\" (Genesis 38:9-10).\n \n For Jewish writers of Scripture, a man sleeping with another man was an abomination. But it was also an abomination (and one worthy of death) to masturbate or even to interrupt coitus (to halt sex with your spouse before ejaculation as an act of birth control). Why were these sexual practices considered abominations by Scripture writers in these ancient times?\n \n Because the Hebrew pre-scientific understanding was that the male semen contained the whole of life. With no knowledge of eggs and ovulation, it was assumed that the man's sperm contained the whole child and that the woman provided only the incubating space. Therefore, the spilling of semen without possibility of having a child was considered murder.\n \n The Jews were a small tribe struggling to populate a country. They were outnumbered by their enemy. You can see why these ancient people felt it was an abomination to risk \"wasting\" even a single child. But the passage says nothing about homosexuality as we understand it today.\n \n The Apostle PaulWe've talked about the passages in the Hebrew Scriptures that are used (or misused) by some people to condemn sexual minorities. Now let's look at three verses from the letters of the apostle Paul in the Christian Scriptures that are used the same way. Remember: First, we'll ask what the text says about God; second, we'll consider what it may or may not say about sexual orientation.",

You use fabricated concepts (lies) to support as fact your own views on the bible says and then claim everyone who disagrees with you is guilty of the very thing you do.\n \n \nI don't, and I don't have to. You see Jo, I am a child of God, not God who created Man in His image. I have no idea why He designed us as He did, but I believe that because He is the eternal God of all time and space that He knows what He is doing, and that He created us perfectly according to His knowledge and wisdom\n\n \n Somewhere who go so far as to claim God is omnipotent. Well there are a couple things he can't do.\n \n Keeping sin from entering the world\n Removing said sin \n Forgiving man by means other than blood sacrifice\n Walking around for 9 months and giving birth to said sacrifice\n Defeat the Canaanites of the Valley\n Die\n \n Yes an omnipotent being by definition cannot die. So much for salvation, but please I so anticipate what creative asinine reason you would give to explain these. My guess you will ignore. \n \n \nHere is a passage in Revelation which is speaking about the song Moses and the Lamb regarding Gods marvelous works which we are, in a future event. I guess this is just more man made tripe since too, huh? You can't see that the New Testament is merely an extension of the Old Testament and inspired in its entirety by the same God who is perfectly consistent in all way imagined and unimagined by your small mind. emoticon_xdonno\n\n \n Because this is your opinion and nothing more. Because you consider it true does not make it so. Because you think, yes think, and one more time think, Paul has become the mouth of God and that you are filled with the spirit giving you the ability to weed through all the conjecture to know the truth of the matter.\n \n You know less than you think, you can prove nothing conclusively, your argument is nothing but a house of cards. Opinion, hope, assumption, speculation, desire, implied meanings, twisting, distorting, misinterpretation and a guess, that is what you go around claiming is truth.",

   "That's fine, Jo, you just spin it any way you want. You won't be spinning it when you stand on the judgment seat of Christ, but then again, perhaps you don't believe in that either? \n \n As Archangel noted: Here: Leviticus 18:22 - \"Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.\" He refers to it as detestable/an abomination, morally repugnant and a perversion no matter how you cut it. Yet you insist on defending it, and you have the nerve to imply that I am not answering your objections?\n \n I am really interested in seeing your spin of the above Leviticus 18:22, looks like you ignored it in your last response.\n\n \n You want spin? Why are you even discussing Leviticus? Your Christian, you passed on the whole of the law remember it's been fulfilled. This man made idea of Moral Law and Age of Grace is not mentioned in the Bible. God nor Jesus say anything about it's ok you decide what you want to keep and what you don't. Because that is exactly what your doing.\n \n It is interesting that he refers to something using each of those phrases. How many times did he repeat himself using slightly different words? Why do you suppose that is? Could it be that man put his own spin on it even before you were born?\n \n You want to try and make your case with the NT go ahead, but don't kid yourself thinking you have any credibility with the OT.",

   "Think about this:\n \n Leviticus 18:22 - \"Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.\" \n \n Leviticus 20:13 - \"If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.\"\n \n Romans 1:26-27 - \"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - \"Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n \n 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - \"But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine...\"\n \n Jude 7 - \"In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.\" \n \n There's no gay marriages in the Old Testament; No gay marriages in the New Testament; no gay sex approved anywhere in the Bible. Just the opposite - gay sex is condemned in both testaments. God is consistent on that.\n\n \n Easy I just got through showing the problems with most of these in The Taint of Christian Sanctity post #135. It was long so I won't post it again, but these claims have all been dealt with. You need to offer something new not just keep ignoring the facts in favor of your opinion.",

Heed these warnings Archangel, or continue to choose the misguided passions of this temporary flesh over the eternal relationship God is seeking to build with you.\n Pro 9:8 Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you, Reprove a wise man and he will love you.\n \n Jer 2:19 \"Your own wickedness will correct you, And your apostasies will reprove you; Know therefore and see that it is evil and bitter For you to forsake the LORD your God, And the dread of Me is not in you,\" declares the Lord GOD of hosts.[/QUOTE]\n \n Take some of your own advice. If you are going to accept the bible shouldn't you accept not only all of it, but also correctly?\n \n Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.",

   "Notice how he speaks for others as he implies a wider base of influence?\n\n \n I speak for no one but myself. Let others have their own opinions...\n \n \n He hopes to suggest he is not alone in his desire to stand against our very honest and accurate criticisms of what he represents. \n\n \n I could care less if I stand alone on this issue. And your so called \"accurate\" criticisms are coupled with inner prejudice and debased emotion and loathing of others you know nothing about.....\n \n \n \nIf you'll notice Jason, nobody is coming to your defense in disagreeing with the opinions of we christians who are all agreed that the bible condemns homosexuality across the board, without compromise. \n\n \n I don't need anyone to come to my so called \"aide\". My beliefs are my own, my faith is personal, and I don't need your approval to convince me my faith is indeed valid....\n \n \n \nOnly you claim to be a christian and insist that God accepts monogamous homosexuality as if that makes it right, normal and good. \n\n \n There are many many other Gay Christians, and those who support us Archie. And the love of Christ will vindicate over your prejudiced bitter scorn...\n \n \nOnly you are lying to yourself in such a massive self deception which will lead to your own destruction.\n\n \n To each his own. You deceive yourself with ignorant debased rants spewed by the same people who blame gays for the worlds problems....\n \n Your sheer stupidity and ignorance knows no bounds...\n \n \n \n \nAnd only you will lash out at us for our very sincere corrections of your reprobate lifestyle as if we are your enemies when it is God Himself whom you are making yourself an enemy of.\n\n \n Sincere? There is nothing sincere about your so called \"correction.\" You mask hate with love, discontent with care, and forgiveness with spite... That much is clear to see.\n \n You could care less about me or any other person other than yourself. And even now your prejudiced bitter words are mixed with this so called \"love\" in which your spew...\n \n Not only are your words lies plain for everyone to see, but you are totally blinded by your zealous ignorant misguided blind so called faith.... How prejudice has consumed even your belief in Christ....\n \n \n May God have mercy on you and reveal the truth to you as you continue to rebel and reject His warnings in His word. \n\n \n I already know the Truth and accepted Christ. But that still is not enough to garner your acceptance, and is not enough to garner being called a Christian. I have to turn on others who don't believe like me first, then I'll be accepted by you....\n \n \nHeed these warnings Jason, or continue to choose the lusts of this temporary flesh over the eternal relationship God is seeking to build with you.\n \n\n \n You should heed your own warnings and keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.... You should read the scripture more carefully and be as one meek and humble only giving a personal testament concerning personal faith...\n \n Not this overbearing zealous prejudice vomit you gush from your mouth as something of faith...",
