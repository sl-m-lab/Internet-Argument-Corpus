Did you even click on the link? Here is what it say's below a picture of three beautiful, perfectly formed babies growing within their mothers womb.\n This is an acutal 4D picture of triplets inside the womb - how absolutely precious and human. At 18 weeks your baby is a marvel to see and to feel. Your baby has the ability to make sounds, turn around inside of you, kick and grasp with its hands.\n Here's the picture: http://app.razorplanet.com/acct/41260-2470/images/18_Weeks_2.jpg\n \n How sad, bitter and cynical you are simone to refer to these babies as mites and charge people who love the unborn enough to speak in their defense with being fetus worshipers as you scream in favor of the women who demand the right to kill their own unborn babies.",

This article makes no such suggestion at all. You are purposely looking to attribute negative connotations to their existence which is a blatantly fallacious inference. Do those 18 week old babies look sickly to you? http://app.razorplanet.com/acct/41260-2470/images/18_Weeks_2.jpg Or like they're in need of special care?\n \n And yes, simone, I would be, and have been willing to personally help procure medical care for children in need of specialized care. And I'm not speaking about my tax dollars, but personally paying bills when parents were overwhelmed by the expenses for needed operations or procedures. Why do you automatically assume we pro-lifers are all talk and no action, just because you pro-death advocates are!",
