The blasts also kills the gigolo that was masquerading as a monkey, admiring the pheasant. Her lover dead, she picks up the hangman's noose and slips it around Falwell's neck. Falwell kneels to massage his foot. God saves him isn't an option, his Dr. Scholl's smell overcomes him because he forgot to shower today. He abruptly starts gagging, the noose is pulled tight.
