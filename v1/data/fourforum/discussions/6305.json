   "??? I'm not sure what you mean here. I don't know if they consider themselves to be so or not, but they fit the definition. (http://www.answers.com/topic/secular-humanism) The ideology of secular humanism is quite broad.\n\n \n I did not say it isn't broad. Almost every system of beliefs is broad.\n \n \nSo, is there some sort of Statement of Beliefs that all secular humanists sign? Is there a governing body that determines what it advocates, to which you pay dues? Is there club membership? You make it sound as though secular humanism is a form of activism or advocacy, but it's just a way of thinking that focuses on humanism over religion, by the definitions I find on the internet.\n\n \n There is no statement of beliefs that all secular humanists sign, just as there is none that all Christians sign. And of course there is no governing body nor membership card. But that doesn't mean just any old belief qualifies as \"Secular Humanism\". Secular Humanism does refer to a set of beliefs, and it is certainly possible to determine a Secular Humanist belief from a belief which goes against Secular Humanism.\n \n You've stated actions which are in contradiction to Secular Humanism, and you've stated they are common among Secular Humanists. As your evidence, you've provided people who neither consider themselves Secular Humanists nor appear to be adhering to Secular Humanist beliefs.\n \n So to put it simply, your evidence centers around random opponents of Christianity, not Secular Humanists.\n \n \nI feel I should also point out that it is religious groups and organizations that tend to provide aid and help to those that need it--I can give you the names of MANY religious organizations that are giving aid to the victims of the hurricane that hit the gulf coast, but I would challenge you to name one atheist or secular humanist organized group that is doing that.\n\n \n Religious charities are successful because people feel it is their duty as part of that religious group to donate. Many Christians, for example, feel that it is their duty as a Christian to help others, and they are reminded of this when they see a Christian charity, so they donate money.\n \n Secular Humanists charities should be less successful. First of all, far fewer people identify themselves as Secular Humanists. But even those who do don't feel an obligation to donate because they are Secular Humanists. They feel obligated to donate because they believe in helping others. The Secular Humanist belief system doesn't involve \"Helping others because God wants it done that way\", it involves \"Helping others because people's lives are valuable and it's the right thing to do.\" So they aren't any more likely to donate to a Secular Humanist charity than any other charity.\n \n But that hasn't stopped Secular Humanists from starting charities; I remember one called SHARE when the Tsunami hit southeast Asia:\n \n http://ga1.org/center_for_inquiry/notice-description.tcl?enewsletter_id=1178062\n \n Though I can tell you I certainly didn't donate to them. I donated to Red Cross, simply because that was easiest and it is a well-known and reputable organization.\n \n And what of other non-Christian organizations that are contributing? How about the Rainbow World Fund. It is a charity focused on getting LGBT people to donate.:\n \n http://www.rainbowworldfund.org/\n \n The idea that Christians are more compassionate and caring than other groups is simply not true; they're just a group whose donations are dependant on how much they are reminded of their religion, though whether that is good or bad is another discussion.",

That just anything goes? Such a statement doesn't even make sense. Well, to answer your question, I don't know who came up with the set of beliefs, but I don't know how you could even question their existence. Even the link you provided states a general overview of them.

Again, who sets this standard for this 'set of beliefs' you claim secular humanists adhere to?\n\n \n I don't know who set the standard.

If someone's statements are in line with that definition, then they are a secular humanist. It's not that complicated.\n\n \n The definition you linked to included compassion! Look, I just reposted it, so take a look. The simple problem with what you're saying is that the people you are describing do not fit into the definition you linked to.\n \n \nNo, it centers on people who fit the definition, pure and simple. You keep claiming that they say something opposed to the secular humanist set of beliefs, yet you don't point to any official set of beliefs.\n\n \n But you already linked to the beliefs; I'm using the beliefs you provided. There's no official Secular Humanist website, just as there is no official Christianity website, no official Wicca website, and no official Buddhist website.\n \n \nIt is much more that that--it is a sense of compassion.\n\n \n I didn't mean to say it wasn't, just that some Christians may be more compassionate when reminded of their religion.\n \n \nThat doesn't mean they aren't secular humanists.

In the same vein, if someone makes statements in line with secular humanism and makes it clear that's they way they beleive, they are seclar humanists.\n\n \n It's true that someone who holds all Secular Humanist beliefs would be a Secular Humanist whether he realizes it or not. That would one way for you to associate someone with Secular Humanism. Another way might be for that person to claim to be a Secular Humanist. My point is that the people you're referring to nethter agree with Secular Humanist beliefs nor do they refer to themselves as Secular Humanist, so you really have no reason to associate them with Secular Humanism at all.\n \n \nDid you know that the Red Cross was founded by a Christian out of his Christian beliefs? The same founder also founded the Young Men's Christian Association.\n\n \n Yes I did. I also know that the Red Cross doesn't allow any male who has had anal sex with another male to donate blood. And I disapprove of that tremendously. But when I am donating money, I'm not out to make a political statement, I'm out to donate to the charity most able to make that money count.\n \n \nI never said Christians were more compassionate and caring than other groups. But there are far more Christian charities and aid groups than from any other element of society. That is a fact. This whole point is a reaction toward anti-Christian people who bring up atrocities in the name of God or claim Christians are hypocrites. But their comments don't reflect reality. Most aid and humanitarian organizations are Christian-based. And that doesn't even include the thousands of churches that donate aid and provide services.\n\n \n You stated that the largest charities are Christian, and you challenged me to find an atheist or Secular Humanist charity. What else could this imply except \"more charities means more compassion\"? My point was simply that more charities means nothing of the sort. It may indicate that Christians are compassionate. But it may as soon indicate that Christians are less willing to donate to non-Christian organizations because they are reminded of the punishment of Hell, while people of other religions do not make such a distinction. I don't mean to say which is true, for certainly there are people who donate for either reason. What I do mean to say is that your point about the number of Christian charities does not support your argument.\n \n Anyhow, I agree that it is wrong to use people who commit atrocities in the name of God as an excuse to call Christians hypocrites. One Christian's actions should not affect the reputation of another's. One person should not be judged by the action of another.\n \n But are you not doing the same thing when you say that you don't like Secular Humanism, then point to people who aren't even Secular Humanists? My point is that you shouldn't be judging Secular Humanism by the actions of those people any more than I should be judging Christianity by the actions of Christians who committed atrocities.",

You seem to be one of these people who thinks no one should talk about gay rights unless they have a stake in it, but it's a debateable issue and this is a debate forum. It doesn't matter whether or not it affects me, it's still an issue to debate, and a good one to use for debate. You should seriously consider going somewhere else if you can't handle other views here, because that's what this place is for. It's a forum.\n\n \n OK.

This is an attempt by jyoshu to appear moderate, when he is way out there.\n\n \n You are correct in the statement that issues of pedophilia are separate, but there was a time early on when NAMBLA was a member of the International Gay and Lesbian Association. That is true. I have no idea what jyoshu has posted in the past on this subject or really I just do not remeber but there is truth to his above post. AND we all know jyoshu and I haven't seen the world eye to eye ever and may never. \n \n From the early parts of the gay rights movement the movement had a \"more the merrier\" attitude. They didn't really inverstigate the groups that joined forces. This remained true for about ten years. In the Early part of the 80's that changed (thank god) Groups like NAMBLA were exposed to the national org. for what they were and demanded they be expelled. SO they were in 1985. Harry Hay wwho was one of the gay rights earliest, oudest members was also a memeber of NAMBLA and rather open about it. \n \n IN the 90's most gay rights groups started advertising their opposition to NAMBLA and exposing them for what they really were..pedophiles. They were finally prohibited from marching in pride parades when lesbian groups cames along and threaten to split ties with the New Yrok Pride Parade if NAMBLA was allowed to march......That along with regular FBI raids of their meeting has brought the group to a standstill. I am not sure if they even exists anymore. Although I have no reason to check this either....don't care enough.\n \n The early part of the gay rights movement wasn't that organized. We had a few organized groups but they were small. When we did start to really mobilize in the later part of the 70s, Gays had a focus on any law that was considered harrassing to us, and age consent laws were at that point used agaisnt gays frequently. So some of the early groups tried to change them. NAMBLA hooked on to that and tried to ride the tails but they didn it for a different and more evil reason.\n \n Early pride parades in New York did in fact have NAMBLA march. That is also true. We could lie and say it isn't but there are pics of it. \n \n We as gays and lesbians have come a long way. The begining of this rights movement though, keep in mind, was started by a bunch of men dressed up as women, drinking in a bar.....we have come a long way since then. Mistakes were made in the our early days because we didn't really have a movement, we had a gripe, that gripe is what turned into a movement.",

This too is a case of unacceptable behavior regarding human sexuality according to the Bible. It just seems that to single out homosexuality in this way is to have a double standard.\n\n Perhaps you misunderstood. First off the Bible disapproves of all sexual sin. Second, since marriage has been trivialized and no-fault divorce laws have been enacted, we have seen a whopping 50% of marriages end in divorce. So it's logical that the homosexual community want to redefine marriage and reap the benefits thereto.\n Sexual sin means: fornication, homosexuality, rape, incest, bestiality, and adultery. Reason is that God made and ordained the sexual relationship for one area only. The monogamous heterosexual marriage. Why? Because when we deviate from the blueprint (another engineering metaphore) for our lives and try to \"go it alone,\" then we wind up hurting ourselves and others. BTW, did you know that the Bible makes provision for divorce? Yes. For unrepentant adultery emoticon_xangel",

On the evening before its destruction he sent two angels, in disguise as men, to the city to lead Lot and his family out early the next day. Hospitable Lot invited them to spend the night at his house. During the evening the men of the city surrounded the house and demanded of Lot that he bring the two men out so that they could [19:5]\n \n King James Version: \"know them.\"\n \n Revised Standard Version: \"know them.\"\n \n New International Version: \"have sex with them.\"\n \n When Lot refused to bring his guests out, the men of the city were about to break his door down when the angels struck them all blind and the mob dispersed. The next day Lot and his family were led out of Sodom, and the city was destroyed by fire and brimstone from heaven.\n \n The Hebrew verb used here, \"yadha,\" \"to know,\" is used 943 times in the OT and only ten times clearly to mean \"have sex,\" then it always means heterosexual sex. The word normally used for homosexual sex is \"shakhabh.\" Many scholars believe that in Gen. 19:5 yadha means \"know\" in the sense of \"get acquainted with\" (the city's men may have wondered if these were enemy spies or they might have sensed the city's impending doom and been concerned with what these strangers were doing there) and have several arguments for this, including Sodom's being used as an example of great sin numerous times in the Old and New Testaments with nothing ever said about same-sex sex, and the context of Jesus' references to Sodom (Luke 10:10-13) which seems to imply lack of hospitality as the sin.\n \n Other scholars think it was the common practice of showing dominance over and humiliating outsiders by forcing them to take the part of a (an inferior) woman in a same-gender rape.\n \n Others think it means \"have sex,\" and point to Lot's offering his two virgin daughters to the crowd if sex is what they want, if they will just leave his guests alone. If this is the right interpretation, it is clearly about violent, criminal, gang rape, something always condemnable.\n \n Another thought is expressed by Religion Professor David L. Bartlett: \"This story is certainly an unlikely starting point for a `biblical' understanding of sexual ethics. While the attempted homosexual rape by the men of Sodom is explicitly condemned, the offer by Lot to hand his two virgin daughters over to the violent and lecherous inhabitants of Sodom is related without a word of judgment.\"B-2\n \n Conservative theologian Richard Hays says, \"The notorious story of Sodom and Gomorrah--often cited in connection with homosexuality--is actually irrelevant to the topic.\"B-3\n \n There is nothing in this story applicable to our consideration of homosexuality.",

It's the old \"slippery slope\" argument, but it is valid.\n\n \n You suggest that people will forget all reason and harms created by some sorts of relationships simply because we legalize marriage for a harmless and beneficial sort of relationship. How can such an argument be valid. People will not become fools and people will not demand that harmful actions be legalized. The slippery slope argument is nothing more than an attempt to associate same-sex relationships to a set of harmful relationships, yet it is no more similar to any of those relationships than opposite-sex relationships.\n \n The others are correct in pointing out that beastiality, incest, and likewise have not been legalized in any of the nations which legalized same-sex marriage, nor does it appear that they ever will be nor even that anyone is pushing for them to be.\n \n The claim that same-sex marriage will lead to the legalization of harmful forms of marriage appears to me unfounded and illogical.",

I right now more than usual realize this is anything but selfish, as I send the love of my life to New Orleans as a relief worker for the Red Cross. I would like nothing more than for him to stay home with me. I hate it when he is away. I hate it more that he is going to a place plagued by raw seage and disease causing viruses and bacteria. The catch is that he really wants to go, he feels it is what he can do to help. WHo am I to stop him from doing what he wants. This is anything but selfish. Trust me this is only one small example of the sacrifices we make as humans in relationships to \"work\" at it. \n \n Many gays and lesbians have been together for 50 years, just like bassmans family. Those long term relationships, with or without marriage, take a lot of work and sacrifice. It is eating the over-cooked, yucky pork chops, and saying it was the best meal. Why, because the one you love took the time to make it just for you......so ya know what? burn to a crisp, it is the best meal ever....because it was made with love.... \n \n I am sure if bassman sat and learned more about gay couples and what gay couples are like, he would see that our realtionships are not selfish or hedonistic or anything else the extreme right says about us.....We are not promiscus, in fact not only would I never cheat on my partner, I know in my heart he would never do that to me.....Why trade a lifetime of love for a momentary bliss....\n \n bassman would changed his mind fast if he took the time to really learn about gay realtionships, and the extra struggles we have because we do not have marriage protections.

Personally, I'd much rather trust the moral code of a person who has reasoned out why something is immoral (e.g., it harms someone, it results in a logically arrived-at, concrete negative effect on society, etc.) than one who only believes something to be immoral because he read that a supernatural being \"said so\" in a book written thousands of years ago. It's not enough to act out of blind obedience to anyone or anything (much less obedience to a self-contradicting mythical entity)--you need to understand why  something is right or wrong. People frequently commit the most heinous crimes because \"God made them do it;\" there are several people in prison at this very moment for killing gay people who've given just such a justification. Clearly, a religious code is an insufficient guarantee of morality.",

You're the one making generalized statements such as that religion and morality can't be one and the same.\n\n \n In some people's opinion, it is moral to do whatever God demands. In others', it is moral to do that which helps individuals, society as a whole, or others. These are not the same thing, or at least, if one believe that God's will is moral, then they believe that man's perception of what is helping people is actually harming people, so man should not attempt to help others but instead attempt to do God's will.\n \n I don't know where I'm going with that paragraph, but it seemed relevant at the time.\n \n \nYour view of the Bible is one of snippets here and there. You have to take the whole thing wholistically and realize there are themes running through it, where God deals with people one way in certain time periods and in other ways later, in Christ. Though the possibility of judgement is always there.\n\n \n I don't particularly believe in the Bible. But I do think that it cannot be understood without being looked at wholistically because I think that it contradicts itself in individual places.\n \n For example, the Bible does demand that we kill people of different religions. It explains exactly how it is to be done in certain cases, and it states exactly who is responsinble for making sure those people are killed. It also states that we should not kill and that we should treat others as we treat ourselves. By focusing on the theme I feel more prominant (certainly in the New Testament), we can understand that we should not kill.\n \n The Bible further makes implications about the morality of homosexuality (well, according to some). But it is a wrong decision to look only at those statement instead of taking the Bible wholistically, understanding what the Bible truly says about how we should treat others. And it never states that you should give yourself more than you give another. Make no mistake that this does not allow you to grant yourself a special legal title which suggests your superiority over homosexuals.\n \n \nI find it interesting when people assume God should be a certain way just because THEY think it's the right thing to do. Why is God in any way obligated to not wipe anyone he wants off the face of the earth? He's God--He can do what He wants.

Do you actually think that in the face of a divine all-powerful reality, it really matters what any of us think is the the right thing for God to do? God is not beholden to your view of morality.\n\n \n If there is a God, he may not be beholden to my view of morality. But the farther he drifts away from my view of morality, then the more suffering and atrocities he creates. Should God drift far enough away from my view of morality, then I question whether he could even be considered moral at all. The point of saying \"I will never follow a God like that\" is not to punish God, it is to offer our own protection and support for to those who God would be harming if he were \"like that\".\n \n \nPeople, in my experience deal with God in one of three ways:\n [*]They refuse to believe in Him[*]They may believe in Him but only want to think of Him in terms of what THEY want Him to be like[*]They accept that He is God even if there are things He has done in history they don't understand or personally approve of\n\n \n This list is the real reason I made this post. It is a biased list, or at least one made out of a lack of understanding for the opposing views. So let me present my opposing (and probably equally biased) view.\n \n People do not refuse to believe in God because they don't approve of his actions. People cannot choose what they believe. The actions of God may disenchant people with the idea that God is good and God exists. It may lead them temporarily to refuse to believe in God or refuse to follow God. But this is not how atheists or agnostics are born. Atheists and agnostics are people who have used logic to come to the conclusion that there is no more reason to believe God exists than to believe any fantasy creature exists. And in as much as you cannot choose to believe in dragons, they cannot choose to believe in God.\n \n The second group of people is a group of people who believes that God exists and is good. It doesn't necessarily matter to them what the Bible says because God is a good being and the Bible was written by men. In some senses, this could be considered a rather random belief. What evidence is there that God follows their own individual opinion of what is moral? But perhaps that is still more logical in my opinion than the last belief.\n \n The last belief is that God's will is written in the Bible. Even if we start with the assumption that God does exist, the idea that his morality is written in the Bible is really no more logical than the idea that his morality is same same as your own. There is no evidence to suggest that either one is God's will, and there is no evidence that makes one more likely than the other. However, I say that it is less logical to consider the Bible the morality of God because doing so requires us to accept a morality that we don't even personally agree with, that we don't even necessarily think is moral at all.\n \n It is a matter of faith, I guess. People's faith doesn't change easily. But I'm not sure I'll ever really understand it.",

After all the constition says it's wrong to deny free speech, so someone might interpret that as an excuse to kill someone who has the opinion that free speech should be denied. I doubt you would support such a killer. Why then do you not understand that the Bible too, as an interpretable document, is quite clear in most cases and that those who commit violent acts in it's name are misinterpreting it? There IS an obvious way to interpret the Bible when it comes to most moral issues.\n \n Just because the Bible is interpretable (which seems to be the basis of your opposition to it's use as a moral compass), doesn't mean there aren't obvious and mainstream interpretations to it.",

Likewise the doctor shooter. You gave an example, without refering to the Bible, showing how what he was doing was wrong. You appealed to common morality, not Biblical, to back up your belief. Now what I'm calling on you to do is justify calling homosexuality immoral in the same way. Show that there's some common, non Biblical, morality to back up that claim.

   "But as you know, the two violent cases you bring up are rare. Rare enough that they can very well be called wackos. The vast majority of people who use the Bible as a moral compass don't do that sort of thing. At some point you have to note that people such as a bomber or doctor shooter are not altogether ok and have some serious issues. I think if you get the general consensus of the vast majority of people who claim to be Christian, you're going to get far more universal interpretations about moral issues, than not.\n\n \n But if you get that universal opinion today and you compare it to the universal opinion a thousand years ago, you're going to get two completely different results. The common interpretation of the Bible was once that it demanded war and murder, that it mandated kings, that it forbode women from holding any sort of power. Even the most recent Popes have been agreeing with evolution, an interpretation opposed by many Christians. Is it not possible that this most common interpretation of the Bible is more a result of the desire to conform the Bible to the changing morality of our society than the result of some obvious interpretation?\n \n \nWhy then do you not understand that the Bible too, as an interpretable document, is quite clear in most cases and that those who commit violent acts in it's name are misinterpreting it? There IS an obvious way to interpret the Bible when it comes to most moral issues.\n\n \n What makes you so certain that they are misinterpreting it? You can quote passages which condemn violence as surely as they can quote passages which demand it. The idea that we should treat others as we treat ourselves could be understood that you would wish someone to kill you if you were of a different religion, and the commandment against murder could be interpreted to mean that murder isn't the same as killing, as suggested during the Crusades, the Inquisition, wars against Native Americans, and perhaps in some sense even during today's wars, when we don't consider the soldiers who defend our country sinners.\n \n But what other interpretation could there be of Deuteronomy chapter 13, which states specifically that we must kill some people because of they are not Christian?\n \n I don't mean to say that the Bible supports murder, but I do mean to agree that there are different interpretations, and many interpretations may be obvious.",

   "See I want to discriminate against religious people if they can discriminate against gay people. In fact I want to treat anyone who will not accept me the same as they treat me. That means that if I am fired from a church for being gay. I want to be able to fire a christian for being a christian in a busisnes I own.\n I am tired of debating this whole topic. Conservatives will never be convinced that their opinion is unfair, unwarrented, and at times hurtfull to peoples lives.\n\n The two jobs you are referring to aren't equal and that is what you fail to see. In a church it is reasonably possible to follow the teachings of the church with a gay priest or gay bishop much the same way it is not reasonably possible to hire a male stripper at a strip club for men. This are to (polar opposite) examples of \"discrimination\" that is protected by the Civil Rights Act. I think it is very fair to do it this way because certain businesses require certain people. If you run a \"church\" that has teachings of only gays then maybe you can fire people for being straight. So no, it is not unwarrented or unfair unless you wish to tell me that churchs should allow gays and strip clubs should allow men to dance.",

   "Well, you can't be fond of something you disagree with. I ask you to elaborate on how you got to those moral grounds.\n\n \n One is because of the issue of harm. It is obvious that the gay way of life can lead to a greater possibility of STDs. The stats bear that out.\n \n Isn't it ironic that gay rights people claim harm should be the sole determinant of morality, and yet harm IS the reason many morally oppose homosexual behavior?\n \n The other issue is that, unlike you, I don't refuse to make religion a part of my moral thinking. \n \n \nOr not so dangerous. \"I don't think it's literal that I should \"put down\" my child.\" It depends on whether or not we have our own brains engaged.\n\n \n Well heck, you don't even have interpret that as non-literal to know that's not what God intends us to do. The Bible itself makes that clear if you read wholistically and not in snippets as you are portraying it as. Half the problem here is that you are talking about a book you obviously don't know that much about. It's sort of like someone who hasn't really read up on physics trying to tell a group of physicists why they shouldn't rely on a certain formula.\n \n \nI am asking you to tell me how you got to that conclusion. You won't do that. \n\n \n Bull. You've been told numerous times now. You just keep moving the goal posts.\n \n \nWell, we can't prove God exists. So it's anyone's opinion of what this unproven thing, called God, is all about.\n\n \n Well heck, if that's your reponse then I guess I'll go on believing homosexual behavior is immoral since \"we can't prove\" homosexuality is innate. :)",

It's a way for you to use the violent acts of extremists to rhetorically attack everyday good people who happen to disagree with you, and it's very disingenuous.

Marriage laws did not specifically say 'white' or 'black' or 'asian' or whatever. Just like until about 1977 many marriage laws did not specifically state 'man' and 'woman'.\n \n \nYou still have yet to show where it is unconstitutional. The definition of marriage is what makes it constitutional. It provides equal protection because of this. There are many examples like this in our laws today if you want me to name a few..\n\n \n The definition of marriage is not in the constitution. \n \n \nwhich says nothing about marriage...\n\n \n And once again you contradict yourself.\n \n \nAnd then you site the 10th and 14th amendment....10th amendment being that all powers not in the constutition are left to the states or people. I am not sure how that helps your case out...it really helps mine beacuse marriage is not in the constitution. The 14th provides equal PROTECTION under the law. Everyone is protected by the definition of marriage.\n\n \n Massachusetts allows same-sex couples to marry. By that alone, Federal DOMA is unconstitutional based on the 10th Amendment. And since the Commonwealth of Massachusetts does not distinguish between same and opposite sex marriages, then denying federal benefits to same-sex couples on the federal level (which DOMA does) is unconstitutional based on the 14th.\n \n \n \nexactly, the definition of a legal consenting adult doesn't include a goat...much the same way the definition of marriage doesn't include two women or two men. So since the definition is set this doesn't violate anything in the constitution.\n\n \n This is silly. The problem with the definition of marriage - as you see it - is that it is unconstitutional because it restrics marriage based on the gender of tha participants when the law treats different genders equally.

   "You are being disingenuous.\n \n Anti-miscegenation laws specifically outlawed inter-racial marriages. Marriage laws did not specifically say 'white' or 'black' or 'asian' or whatever. Just like until about 1977 many marriage laws did not specifically state 'man' and 'woman'.\n when you say there were laws like that, there were. They were incorrect and not consistent with what marriage historically was and is. However, I will point out that at no point was marriage ever thought of as between two men or two women.\n \n \nThe definition of marriage is not in the constitution. \n For once I agree with you. It is not in the constitution. In fact marriage is not in the constitution so why argue that it is uncosntitutional to have marriage say \"between a man and women\".\n \n \n\n Massachusetts allows same-sex couples to marry. By that alone, Federal DOMA is unconstitutional based on the 10th Amendment. And since the Commonwealth of Massachusetts does not distinguish between same and opposite sex marriages, then denying federal benefits to same-sex couples on the federal level (which DOMA does) is unconstitutional based on the 14th.\n No, because what the state reconginzes and what the federal government does are two different things. DOMA states that for federal purposes the marriages in Mass. aren't marriages at all. As I read DOMA it says that for federal purposes marriage is defined between a women and a man but for state purposes (since states are the ones that marry) they make do what they want. This is perfectly legal. The only main federal aspect to marriage is pretty much tax. \n \n \nThis is silly. The problem with the definition of marriage - as you see it - is that it is unconstitutional because it restrics marriage based on the gender of tha participants when the law treats different genders equally. Since constitution does not bestow rights upon farm animals or objects, they do not obtain rights under the constitution.\n The definition of marriage is not up for debate...it is what it is. People tend to think we make up words and then decide what will fit into that word but it is the other way around, we have words to describe certain things. For example, marriage, was a word to describe a union between a man and a women and this is supported since the earliest of records. As for the goat having no rights...this is true, because the world \"people\" or \"citizen\" have a definition that doesn't include farm animals, it only includes humans. The point being, we have words that have meaning. To say the word discriminates is silly much the same way it would be silly to say a pig should be included in the word \"person\". From this we can conclude that it would be silly to say marriage discriminates because doesn't include 2 men in its meaning.",

   "And just why are heterosexuals entitled to a legal institute which is denied to homosexuals? Do heterosexuals have some special need, should they have some special privledge denied to homosexuals?\n The question you are asking here is not whether or not homosexuals should marry but whether or not privileges should be given to an institute that is not available to single people and homosexuals. This is something you could debate and probably has more backing then saying homosexuals should be allowed to marry. This basis for this debate would be to say anyone should allowed tax benefits for living with someone else. However, there are valid reasons to deny this premise. If you wish to argue this we can do so as well.\n \n \nWhat you have done is created a legal institution, which you have denied to homosexuals. You've given yourself special legal rights and privledges. That denies both the equality of homosexuals and the freedom of homosexuals to use those rights and privledges. That elevates yourself over others. Then, when homosexuals ask for access to these same rights and privledges that you give to yourself, you accuse them of \"hjacking\" your institution. But you deserve that institution no more than anyone else. To ask for the same rights and privledges that you would grant yourself is not hijacking; it's seeking out fair and equal treatment for those who don't have it.\n As stated above, you are arguing two different things. The privileges can be argued by a single person as well. I don't see you saying they are being denied rights. But when you say you wish to marry, this does hijack and institute that already exists and is limited. The question about whether this institute should be in government is a different question all together. In a way, by wanting gay marriage you are implying you want to be a part of an institute that denies privledges to certain people (at this point it would be single people).\n \n \nWe're not talking about changing your experience of the institution or removing anything you already have. We're talking about allowing it for the people that have been denied it in addition to those who already have it.\n You are talkign about changing my experience. I gave an example earlier where you destroy a name for something and destroy what something stands for. No one is saying you can't make your own institute though (such as civil unions) that would gain the same benefits without hijacking the institute that many of us hold dear.",

   "When you have a majority group that disapproves of a minority, and that minority views both groups as equal, then you split the names of the rights of the minority and majority groups, the names of the majority's rights become a benefit in themselves.\n\n \n This idea that a term becomes a benefit has no constitutional backing, BTW. It's simply a matter of your opinion. If we were talking about the term being the ONLY way to receive the appropriate benefits, it would be different, but we're not talking about that since I've made it clear I support you getting benefits too.\n \n \nOr more specifically, the title of \"marriage\" is a benefit that acts as a title to be held by the majority, and a means of looking down on those who are not part of a marriage.\n\n \n Terminology for the majority takes place all the time. (Do you think blacks want to be called \"white?\") The \"looking down on\" part is speculative. You'll have to prove that to use it as any kind of reasonable basis.\n \n \nIt is very quantifiable; denying the same legal titles to homosexuals that are granted to heterosexuals will lead to heterosexuals looking down on homosexuals.\n \n \n Then quantify it.

If that were not the case, it would not be considered, say, \"between two people.\"\n \n \nMarriage is a word, just like any other. Its meaning changes, and it may have multiple meanings.\n\n \n Yes, it is a term, but it happens to be a term that has been sacred to opposite-sex couples for a very long time, and refers to their relationships. The idea that it could refer to same-sex relationships is new in this country (relatively speaking). Why would you want to steal that terminology from those to whom it applies by broadening it? Why would you even WANT to have your relationships described in opposite-sex terminolgy anyway?\n \n Terms may change, but that doesn't mean that the change of a term many find to be sacred is a good thing.\n \n \nNow it may be that we've chosen an inapporpriate word. I mean, if I were creating a set of legal benefits to guarantee freedom of speech, and I called them \"dragon toes\", well that might not make sense. I mean, I suppose it wouldn't really matter, I mean, eventually we'd all get to know that \"dragon toes\" means freedom of speech, and we'd move on with no harm done. But, okay, maybe it makes more sense to choose something that more accurately describes the rights we're talking about. I can understand that.\n\n \n I think the answer is not to take the term \"marriage\" from everyone, but to let each type of couple call their relationships what is appropriate without taking the other's.

Because there is no other effect, the only logical reason we should support that is to influence people to look down on gays. Why should we do that?\n \n \nThen quantify it. You are only giving opinion here with statements like \"they will look down on us.\" That's speculative, not evidence. (HINT: you can't quantify something that is a matter of what people might feel or perceive)\n\n \n Sure I can. I can point out sociological evidence which suggests that members of majority groups identify minority groups through labels and that they assign stereotypes and prejedices to those groups. I can point out sociological evidence which suggests that an individual's view of another will change when he discovers that other has the label of a minority group attached to him.\n \n I can then use logic to determine the Sociological effects of segregating people's rights.\n \n This is not speculation, this is an understanding of sociology, how people interact with each other, and the effects of segregating people. It is science, not speculation.\n \n By giving everyone the same rights under the law, we can avoid seperating people into two groups: gay and straight. Harm does exist in that segregation; it only takes a little knowledge of Sociology to know that.\n \n \nMmm, that's pretty shaky ground you on. Again, completely unquantifiable. I may have a neighbor myself that would prefer me to be out of the neighborhood because he thinks my lawnmower is too loud. Sorry, but I just don't feel harmed at all that he wants me to leave.\n\n \n I'm on shaky ground? I cannot recall even a single rational reason that you wish to create an unprecedented segregation of legal rights between gay and straight people. You're spending your time attacking what I've said instead of defending your own point of view. What reason could you possibly have for claiming that straight people and gay people should have different names for their rights under the law?\n \n That being said, you may have a neighbor who wants you to leave, and that is one thing. But you shouldn't have to live under a legal system that wants you to leave. By giving heterosexuals \"marriage\" and homosexuals something different, you are accomplishing nothing but influencing people to disapprove of homosexuality. It isn't the fact that your neighbor dislikes you that is the problem; the problem is that our law is teaching your neighbors to dislike you.\n \n \nSure there is. If that were not the case, it would not be considered, say, \"between two people.\"\n\n \n I disagree. Marriage, at least the side of marriage we're talking about, is between two people because that is how our laws define it. Now there may be some religious version of marriage that you hold, just as there is one that I hold. But those aren't what we're talking about, and certainly our religious versions are very different from one another.\n \n \nYes, it is a term, but it happens to be a term that has been sacred to opposite-sex couples for a very long time, and refers to their relationships. The idea that it could refer to same-sex relationships is new in this country (relatively speaking). Why would you want to steal that terminology from those to whom it applies by broadening it? Why would you even WANT to have your relationships described in opposite-sex terminolgy anyway?\n\n \n Marriage is sacred to a lot of people. It is sacred to gay people as much as it is sacred to you. Simply because gay people have not been legally allowed to marry does not mean that marriage is not sacred to them. And simply because long-dead heterosexuals were the ones powerful enough to legalize their own marriage doesn't mean that marriage belongs only to heterosexuals. I personally do not care that some heterosexuals hadn't considered the possibility that homosexuals could use the same legal rights that they have or that it's a new idea. What does that have to do with anything? What I care about is that same-sex couples who want the same legal recognition for their relationships as opposite-sex couples are not receiving it. There is no excuse for that.\n \n You suggest that I'm \"stealing terminology.\" What does that even mean? Who owns terminology? I didn't realize that heterosexuals owned the word marriage and that I'm stealing it. In fact, how would extending marriage to same-sex relationships be stealing anyway? Heterosexuals still have marriage. What have I taken from them?\n \n As for why I'd want my relationship to be described as a marriage, well frankly, \"marriage\" doesn't imply any combination of sexes for me. It never has, and it never will. I call same-sex unions \"marriages\" because in my opinion, that's what they are. You may think differently, and that's fine. I could care less what individuals think the term means. I just want our law to give both same-sex and opposite-sex relationships the same name, the exact same legal recognition.\n \n \nTerms may change, but that doesn't mean that the change of a term many find to be sacred is a good thing.\n\n \n It doesn't mean it's a bad thing, either. Heterosexuals defined \"marriage\" as their own religious view of it. They didn't acknowledge the definition of anyone else. As you may have noticed, that hasn't stopped me from believing that same-sex relationships qualify as marriage. And when heterosexuals did that, what harm came of it? The only harm that came of it is that homosexuals and heterosexuals were no longer equal under the law. That harm can be fixed.\n \n But let's say there is some harm in changing the legal definition of marriage. Then what is our solution? I've already presented it: choose a different word for everyone.\n \n \nI think the answer is not to take the term \"marriage\" from everyone, but to let each type of couple call their relationships what is appropriate without taking the other's. For opposite-sex couples this has traditionally been the term \"marriage.\" I don't see why same-sex couples would not want their own term too.\n\n \n For same-sex couples, that has also traditionally been \"marriage\", you just do not seem to understand that.\n \n But the important thing is this: we don't create seperate legal names for every group involved, and we don't reserve special legal titles for certain groups. When we create freedom of speech, we don't say, \"Okay, straight people, what do you want to call your freedom of speech? Gay people, what about you? Ah, sorry gays, the straight people already took that name.\" We don't say, \"Okay we're going to create marriage. Same-race couples, what do you want to call yours? Interracial couples, what do you want to call yours? Ah, no 'marriage' is already in-use by same-race couples. Sorry.\" \"Okay, now we're creating the right to welfare. Blonde-haired people, what do you want to call your right. Brunettes, what about you?\"\n \n The whole idea is absurd, that straights have taken the name \"marriage\", and therefore gays can't use it.

We should give everyone the same legal rights under the law.\n \n So why do it? Explain why what you say is a good idea. I don't see any benefit in your solution. Let me state this again, because it is important: The idea that sexual orientation should determine the name of your rights under the law is discrimination, and it accomplishes nothing more than segregation.",

   "Now I may not have proved that it will happen, but I have shown through logic that the only possible effect segregating gay and straight rights could possibly have is to cause people to look down on gays. \n\n \n NO offense, but I don't think you've shown that at all. I don't think you can. (Not because of any inability on your part, but because it's unprovable. You are in the realm of feelings and emotions here.)\n \n \nSure I can. I can point out sociological evidence which suggests that members of majority groups identify minority groups through labels and that they assign stereotypes and prejedices to those groups. I can point out sociological evidence which suggests that an individual's view of another will change when he discovers that other has the label of a minority group attached to him.I can then use logic to determine the Sociological effects of segregating people's rights.\n This is not speculation, this is an understanding of sociology, how people interact with each other, and the effects of segregating people. It is science, not speculation.\n\n \n Nonsense. The labels would be equal in worth.\n \n \nBy giving everyone the same rights under the law, we can avoid seperating people into two groups: gay and straight. Harm does exist in that segregation; it only takes a little knowledge of Sociology to know that.\n\n \n The only difference would be the term. Not the rights. It's not segregation when everyone has the same water fountain.\n \n \nWhat reason could you possibly have for claiming that straight people and gay people should have different names for their rights under the law?\n\n \n The same reason that many minority and majority status people of varying groups have different terms. The govt, for instance, doesn't have ONE term for all of them. The problem is that you only see the term as a 1st and 2nd class citizen thing. You think it reflects some sense of worth and it does not. Because we are talking about a situation where the govt. gives the same benefits to both groups.\n \n \nBy giving heterosexuals \"marriage\" and homosexuals something different, you are accomplishing nothing but influencing people to disapprove of homosexuality.\n\n \n Again, I am thoroughly un convinced that you can prove that.\n \n \nMarriage is sacred to a lot of people. It is sacred to gay people as much as it is sacred to you.\n\n \n But why would a traditionally opposite-sex term be sacred to same-sex couples? Esp. given that we are talking about the same benefits for both unions?\n \n \nYou suggest that I'm \"stealing terminology.\" What does that even mean? Who owns terminology? I didn't realize that heterosexuals owned the word marriage and that I'm stealing it. In fact, how would extending marriage to same-sex relationships be stealing anyway? Heterosexuals still have marriage. What have I taken from them?\n\n \n Well, I would think you would understand what I'm saying here. Groups tend to identify with terminology all the time. You identify with the term \"gay\" and even as a point of pride. If benefits are equal, why shouldn't straight couples in a union be able to identify with the term \"married\"? Even as a point of pride? In fact they DO identify with it, and have for a long, long time. Would you want all people out there to start using the term \"gay\" even if they aren't homosexual, thereby robbing the term of it's significance? It's the same difference with the term \"marriage\".\n \n \nAs for why I'd want my relationship to be described as a marriage, well frankly, \"marriage\" doesn't imply any combination of sexes for me. \n\n \n But it does for many straight people, and that's the point. They've had that term for many, many generations, just like you've now had the term \"gay\" for quite sometime, as a point of pride.\n \n \nBut let's say there is some harm in changing the legal definition of marriage. Then what is our solution? I've already presented it: choose a different word for everyone.\n\n \n I think acknowleding that the term marriage isn't a point of worth and letting each group take the term that works best for them without taking the other's would be the better way.\n \n \nBut the important thing is this: we don't create seperate legal names for every group involved, and we don't reserve special legal titles for certain groups. When we create freedom of speech, we don't say, \"Okay, straight people, what do you want to call your freedom of speech? Gay people, what about you? Ah, sorry gays, the straight people already took that name.\" We don't say, \"Okay we're going to create marriage. Same-race couples, what do you want to call yours? Interracial couples, what do you want to call yours? Ah, no 'marriage' is already in-use by same-race couples. Sorry.\" \"Okay, now we're creating the right to welfare. Blonde-haired people, what do you want to call your right. Brunettes, what about you?\"\n\n \n That's why we would still call the benefits what they are--\"benefits.\"\n \n \nSo why do it? Explain why what you say is a good idea. I don't see any benefit in your solution. \n\n \n Well, I think I have. It is a good idea because it is wrong to take a term that one group has as an identity and essentially rob it of it's meaning. Just like the term \"gay pride\" would lose meaning if everyone in the world started using it even if they weren't gay and didn't subscribe to your movement, and started using it to mean other things.",

You continually misuse the stats.\n \n \nIf stats indicated that people who drive cars have more wrecks than those who drive trucks, then it's safe to say that a person driving a car has a greater possibility of having a wreck. This isn't rocket science.\n\n \n Regarding your analogy, there would be many variables. We are talking about a greater possibility of disease connected to unsafe sex, not a greater possibility from being or acting gay. \n \n \nWell, one reason is the harm factor I mentioned above.

He became good friends with Paine, Jefferson, and read Enlightenment literature. Later he abandoned Christian orthodoxy for rationalism and became an advocate of secular government. Barlow, along with his associate, Captain Richard O'Brien, et al, translated and modified the Arabic version of the treaty into English. From this came the added Amendment 11. Barlow forwarded the treaty to U.S. legislators for approval in 1797. Timothy Pickering, the secretary of state, endorsed it and John Adams concurred (now during his presidency), sending the document on to the Senate. The Senate approved the treaty on June 7, 1797, and officially ratified by the Senate with John Adams signature on 10 June, 1797. All during this multi-review process, the wording of Article 11 never raised the slightest concern.  The treaty even became public through its publication in The Philadelphia Gazette on 17 June 1797. \n\n \n \nAlthough the Christian exclusionary wording in the Treaty of Tripoli only lasted for eight years and no longer has legal status, it clearly represented the feelings of our Founding Fathers  at the beginning of the U.S. government. \n",

   "\n In the case of the term \"marriage\", it's a way for the govt. to know that two opposite-sex partners have a union and need couples' benefits. There's no reason why same-sex couples would conceivable want to use an opposite-sex term to get couples' benefits. This is not a case of \"separate-but-equal\" it's a case of simple terminology. We're talking about drinking from the same wanter fountain . . . er, benefits here.\n\n You keep saying that it's just for opposite-sex partners, but there's nothing inherent in the benefits that requires that. They're all geared towards two adults, living together, maybe raising a family. There's absolutely no reason why the government would need to track same-sex couples seperately from opposite-sex couples. If the benefits are exactly the same and always will be than there's no reason for two terms, it gains us nothing. And as for there being no reason why gays would want to use the \"opposite-sex term\", see below.\n \n \n \n\n This idea that having two terms would be a case of 1st and 2nd class citizenship is only because you choose to attach 1st-class stigma to the word \"marriage.\" It doesn't have to be that way.\n\n It shouldn't be that way, but it will be. Gays are already considered second class citizens, or worse, in many places in this country. Surely you're aware of this? Gays still need to fight to work and live where they want to, and are still being killed just for being gay. If you create a term that just applies to gay marriage, then there will be a stigma attached to that term. \"Couples nights\" will turn into \"Married couples night\", implicitly excluding gays. When meeting someone new people will see a wedding ring and say \"Oh! You're married. Or, are you... er.. no offence, but, you know...\" The discrimination might be subtle or blatant, but it will be pervasive, you can count on it.\n \n If you create a term and apply it to a group that is already considered second class by far too many, than that term will acquire second class status. If what gays are doing is exactly the same as what straights are doing, and if the benefits are exactly the same, then you should could call it the same thing. If you don't then you're just confirming that you don't really consider \"gay marriage\" equal to \"straight marriage\". And if gay marriage isn't equal to straight marriage, I really don't think you believe it's better.",

   "NO offense, but I don't think you've shown that at all. I don't think you can. (Not because of any inability on your part, but because it's unprovable. You are in the realm of feelings and emotions here.)\n\n \n I am not in the realm of feelings and emotions, I am in the realm of the science of how people treat each other based on symbols and labels. It is Sociology, and it teaches us many things about how people treat each other.\n \n \nNonsense. The labels would be equal in worth.\n\n \n Nonsense? That doens't refute my logic at all. The truth is that any Sociologist will tell you that the effects of creating seperate labels for the same legal rights will harm a disapproved-of minority.\n \n \nThe only difference would be the term. Not the rights. It's not segregation when everyone has the same water fountain.\n\n \n Yet we call that water fountain the \"fountain\" for whites, and the \"survival tube\" for blacks? Such a distinction is segregation. There is no reason that we need a special legal term to distinguish blacks using water fountains instead of whites using water fountains. Putting that sort of distinction into law is segregation.\n \n \nThe same reason that many minority and majority status people of varying groups have different terms. The govt, for instance, doesn't have ONE term for all of them. The problem is that you only see the term as a 1st and 2nd class citizen thing. You think it reflects some sense of worth and it does not. Because we are talking about a situation where the govt. gives the same benefits to both groups.\n\n \n The government may not use the same terms to describe members of different minority groups. But that's not what we're talking about. I'm not talking about saying that \"straight\" and \"gay\" should mean the same thing.\n \n What the government does not do is segregate their legal rights. The government doesn't take some legal right that has nothing to do with race and say, \"for whites it is called this, and for blacks it is called something else.\" And they shouldn't say, \"for gays it is called this, and for straights it is called something else.\" The government never ever does that. I challenge you to find even one example of it.\n \n The problem is that you're trying to enforce the idea that same-sex relationships have some unspoken significant difference from opposite-sex relationships. You're putting into law the idea that there is more than just gender that seperates the two. But there isn't. You are taking this set of benefits under the law, which should have nothing to do with sexual orientation, and you're giving it different names depending on whether the individuals involved are gay or straight. That's wrong.\n \n \nAgain, I am thoroughly un convinced that you can prove that.\n\n \n You say that I cannot prove that the only effect would be harm. Yet you haven't really provided any evidence that my harm will not occur, and Sociology suggests that it would. So what other effects are there? Heterosexuals would have to share the term \"marriage\" with homosexuals? Is that harmful in any fashion whatsoever? I can't think of even a single problem with having heterosexuals share that term with homosexuals. Why is it wrong? Because heterosexuals claimed marriage for themselves long ago, so now homosexuals can never use it? Stopping heterosexuals from doing that isn't a harm, it's a benefit. Why should heterosexuals have full legal claim to a word with singificance for both heterosexuals and homomsexuals?\n \n \nBut why would a traditionally opposite-sex term be sacred to same-sex couples? Esp. given that we are talking about the same benefits for both unions?\n\n \n First, it is only a traditionally opposite-sex term according to heterosexuals and our laws. Homosexuals have long held the same religions as heterosexuals, and they hold sacred interpretations of that word.\n \n And think of your own upbringing. Is what you consider sacred based on what others have done in the past? Or is it based on what you have been raised to believe in your life? I, like many in our society, was raised believing that one day I would fall in love with someone and marry that person. Marriage is sacred because we are raised to understand it as sacred, we are raised with religious beliefs that make it sacred.\n \n But the real point is that heterosexuals were morally wrong to claim that their own relationships are deserving of some special legal term denied to homosexuals. They are wrong to distinguish legal rights based on sexual orientation, and they are wrong to claim a word that many feel sacred for their own.\n \n \nWell, I would think you would understand what I'm saying here. Groups tend to identify with terminology all the time. You identify with the term \"gay\" and even as a point of pride. If benefits are equal, why shouldn't straight couples in a union be able to identify with the term \"married\"? Even as a point of pride? In fact they DO identify with it, and have for a long, long time. Would you want all people out there to start using the term \"gay\" even if they aren't homosexual, thereby robbing the term of it's significance? It's the same difference with the term \"marriage\".\n\n \n The reason heterosexuals shouldn't be able to identify themselves with the term \"married\" is because \"married\" doesn't refer to the physical differences between people, it refers to a set of benefits under the law. I have no problem if the law uses \"straight\" and \"gay\" to distinguish between hetersexuals and homosexuals. But I do have a problem if the law creates two seperate sets of legal benefts \"heterorights\" and \"homorights\". It is okay to use different terms to distinguish between different groups of people, but it's not okay to name the legal rights of those people different things.\n \n And looking at the paragraph I just wrote again, I think that's exactly what you're doing, establishing \"heterorights\" and \"homorights\". It is no better than creating \"white rights\" and \"black rights\", or \"men's speech\" and \"women's speech\". I don't mind the law using some terms to distinguish between whites and blacks, but I do mind if the law starts giving different names to the rights held by those groups.\n \n \nBut it does for many straight people, and that's the point. They've had that term for many, many generations, just like you've now had the term \"gay\" for quite sometime, as a point of pride.\n\n \n Why would it matter how long they've had it? Does that mean that they are somehow harmed by expanding the term to include more people? Why would it? Am I harmed by expanding the term \"citizen\"? Are handicapped people harmed by expanding the term \"handicapped\"? Of course not, they've still got the term, and now more people have it.\n \n You are speaking as though straight people are losing something by associating themselves with gays. But they're not. It's just a legal term, and they can keep that term, but if they want to put it in the law, then they must grant it to everyone fairly.\n \n \nI think acknowleding that the term marriage isn't a point of worth and letting each group take the term that works best for them without taking the other's would be the better way.\n\n \n How can you even speak in groups? Why do you seperate straight people and gay people, but not white people and black people? Why do you say that gays and straights must choose different names for their marriage, but not whites and blacks? Why not interracial and same-race couples? Why not blondes and brunettes? Why is it that you choose to seperate people into groups based on their sexual orientation, but nothing else? Why can people of different sexual orientations not have the same name for their legal rights in your opinion?\n \n I have no problem with everyone calling their own union whatever they want. But our law needs to call those legal benefits something, and that something shouldn't be different depending on your sexual orientation.\n \n \nThat's why we would still call the benefits what they are--\"benefits.\"\n\n \n If that's what we're calling them, then why is the word \"marriage\" part of our legal system at all? Why don't we change the legal name to \"benefits\" for everyone, and keep the term \"marriage\" out of our laws alltogether? Why is it that you need some special term for your relationships instituted into our laws, mandated to the people, some special term that you deny to homosexuals?\n \n \nWell, I think I have. It is a good idea because it is wrong to take a term that one group has as an identity and essentially rob it of it's meaning. Just like the term \"gay pride\" would lose meaning if everyone in the world started using it even if they weren't gay and didn't subscribe to your movement, and started using it to mean other things.\n\n \n The term \"gay pride\" might lose its meaning if everyone in the world started using it, even if they weren't gay. But that's why I don't advocate creating a legal institution called \"gay pride\" and attempt to give it only to gay people. The term \"gay pride\" has nothing to do with our laws at all. The second I create a legal institution called \"gay pride\", I am morally responsible for making sure that everyone who deserves access to that institution has it, and that I'm not using sexual orientation as a means of distinguishing between rights.\n \n And do you know what, if everyone started using \"gay pride\" whether they agreed with the movement or not, I wouldn't care. It's just words. Soon enough, some new set of words would appear to describe the gay rights movement, and no one would be harmed, and I will have lost no sense of identity. In the same fashion, if we make legal marriage for everyone, people will have no problem using \"same-sex marriage\" or \"opposite-sex marriage\" to distinguish between the two. So how is that harmful at all?\n \n And you know what, allowing same-sex couples to use \"marriage\" is barely altering the meaning of marriage at all. Before the gay rights movement, if I asked people what marriage is, they'd tell me it's about commitment, love, children, and the desire to start and support your family. All of those things would still be completely true; there would be nothing more than a minor change to make marriage more fair to everyone.\n \n But if you are so worried about \"marriage\" losing its meaning, then take it out of our laws. That's the bottom line. If you don't want marriage to be applied equally to everyone, then don't put it into our laws.",

   "when you say there were laws like that, there were. They were incorrect and not consistent with what marriage historically was and is. However, I will point out that at no point was marriage ever thought of as between two men or two women.\n\n \n Incorrect according to whom? To what? Historically, the definition of marriage has changed. It used to be between a man and as many women as he can afford. In some places it still is.\n \n Who would you say is right?\n \n \n For once I agree with you. It is not in the constitution. In fact marriage is not in the constitution so why argue that it is uncosntitutional to have marriage say \"between a man and women\".\n\n \n It isn't unconstitutional to say marriage is a union between a man and a woman. I believe it is unconstitutional for it to ONLY be a union between one man and one woman, at least not without just cause. Legally, there is no difference between a man and a woman. That said the restriction based on gender is un-justified, and unconstitutional.\n \n \n No, because what the state reconginzes and what the federal government does are two different things. DOMA states that for federal purposes the marriages in Mass. aren't marriages at all. As I read DOMA it says that for federal purposes marriage is defined between a women and a man but for state purposes (since states are the ones that marry) they make do what they want. This is perfectly legal. The only main federal aspect to marriage is pretty much tax.\n \n \n It is unconstitutional because, once a state declares a marriage legal, then there is no difference legally between marriage A and marriage B from that state. For the government to give benefits to marriage A and not to marriage B violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n \n \nThe definition of marriage is not up for debate...it is what it is. People tend to think we make up words and then decide what will fit into that word but it is the other way around, we have words to describe certain things. For example, marriage, was a word to describe a union between a man and a women and this is supported since the earliest of records. As for the goat having no rights...this is true, because the world \"people\" or \"citizen\" have a definition that doesn't include farm animals, it only includes humans. The point being, we have words that have meaning. To say the word discriminates is silly much the same way it would be silly to say a pig should be included in the word \"person\". From this we can conclude that it would be silly to say marriage discriminates because doesn't include 2 men in its meaning.\n\n \n \n Which brings us back to the first point I made. Which definition of marriage is supposed to be the \"right\" one?",

   "No, I don't think this analogy works to well. There is no reason other than prejudice to not allow a black man to walk in the front door. The front door is also not equal to the back door as one is in the front and one in the back. No one seems to want to answer the question about single people. Why can't single people call themselves married and get the same benefits. I don't see you arguing rights for them.\n\n \n Let me say this: every right granted to married people that can be given to single people should be. There is no reason that we should be favoring married people over single people. But I think we pretty much do give them those rights. We allow them their own health insurance coverage, we allow them to count themselves as a dependency on their tax forms, we recognize their children as their own, etc. Most of the benefits of marriage do not make sense without a second person. Who else's health coverage would a single person get? Who would a single person be able to naturalize into the US? Who else would a single person get to count on his tax forms?\n \n And I've got no problem with a single person calling himself married. If he wants, I'll say it too. But we've also got a institution in our laws which extends those benefits to another person. We need to call that institution something. Now, it doesn't really make sense to say that a single person has used that institution. I mean, he hasn't chosen another person to extend those benefits to; why would those extended benefits have anything to do with him?\n \n On the other hand, what reason is there that we shouldn't allow individuals to extend those benefits to members of the same sex? Or why should the name of that institution be different based on gender or sexual orienation? It really shouldn't. The only reason to make the name different would be to seperate gay people from straight people, to make them part of a different group, to segregate them. There's no reason for that; it's harmful.\n \n Now, if you think marriage is the wrong term, then let's get rid of it and use a different term for everyone. And do you know what? If you think single people should be allowed to marry themselves, then that's no problem either. Though it might not make sense, there really isn't much harm that's going to come from allowing a single person to marry himself. If it means that gay people can marry, then I'm all for it because, unlike allowing an individual to marry himself, determining rights based on sexual orientation is always wrong and always harmful.",

   "What I mean is that the gay community (and correct me if I am wrong) seems to want the benefits of what is know called a married couple. These benefits include things like health benefits and estate issues and tax benefits, things like that. So it would make sense to me that instead of wanting \"marriage\" one would say they want the same protection and privileges married couples get. There is a key difference because when one hears \"gay marriage\", like me, they immediatly think about destroying the meaning of something held dear. This probably doesn't right but my previous posts probably explain what I mean a little better. I guess it is like someone stealing your identity in a way (for lack of coming up with something better at 1am).\n\n \n I agree with you we want exactly the same things legal rights, protections, and responsibilities of marriage. I don't care what you call it marriage or civil unions. The issue is this if you want to institute civil unions then all marriage contracts for everyone straight or gay should be called the same thing. Marriage or civil unions I don't care about the title as long as it is the same for a straight couple as well as a gay couples. Marriage would be the simplist since you would have less red tape changing and refiling all those striaght marriage licenses to civil unions.",

In fact, why would I have put myself through so much pain to be something that's so looked down upon in today's world? You think I'd readily choose to be homosexual? But it is who I am, and I am happy with that, despite the homophobes, the conservative christians who are hell bent upon dunking my head in a baptism pool, despite the gay bashers, despite the social stigma. If homosexuality was a choice, who would choose it? I'll be honest here-- I wouldn't have chosen to be a homosexual. But I didn't choose-- it was ingrained in me. At that age when all of the other boys started to notice the girls and fantasize about them, I was doing the same, except about the boys. I could change; i could \"become\" a heterosexual, only in the sense that i would be acting as one, but inside I'd still be a homosexual. Which is in your definition, no better than a murderer.\n\n You missed my point, a Christian life is a changed life. Now with man, this is impossible because we are finite in power and abilities. However, an omnipotent God has that power to change the very nature of people. The only thing is, we have to accept Him on His terms.",

Could it be that heterosexuals already have those rights? Could it possibly be because heterosexuality and its celebration predominates everywhere, such as in families, in all the media, in the workplace, among friends chatting about their heterosexual partnerships, heterosexuals holding hands and kissing in the park. This happens day in and day out, everywhere, not just one special day a year in a parade. It doesn't just happen in a tv special, or in a very rare series or movie, as is the case with gay people.

What we are saying is the oppression of African Americans is wrong for the same reasons that the oppression of homosexuals is. That is the single similarity that everyone is pointing out.\n \n What we are not saying is that homosexuals are suffering to the same extent as African Americans. Or at least, I do not suggest that; I can tell you that much. The problem, I think, is that you're looking for malicious intentions where none exist.

I believe that the logic behind the comparison is sound and valid. So if there is disrespect toward African Americans, I suspect that it comes from the the fact that our society considers it disrepsectful to compare someone to homosexuals, for homosexuals are looked down upon.\n \n On the other hand, if anyone did or does attempt to imply that homosexuals are suffering as much as African Americans did many years ago, then that person is certainly very wrong.

You are picking the one group that has suffered the most in this country, and trying to use it to give credence to one of the groups that has suffered the least. If you were simply pointing out the fact of oppression you'd be inclined to use any group that has dealt with discrimination, no matter how limited the extent.\n\n Implied, or infered? Face it, you're getting desperate here. People use the civil rights movement of the 60's and 70's because they're well known, everyone is familiar with them. They're the most famous civil rights movement in modern US history. I could cite the persecution the Essenes endured in 18'th century America, but that wouldn't mean much to anyone, would it? If someone wants to make an analogy, they use something that's familiar to everyone. If you insist on taking the analogy too far and seeing things that were never intended, that's your problem.\n \n \n\n Look, the gig is up. At least be honest and admit an attempt to use their movement for your causes. It blatantly obvious. Consider it acceptable to do so if you want, but at least don't pretend you all aren't doing it. It's like seeing a kid with his hand clearly in a cookie jar and him saying defiantly \"no, I don't have my hand in the cookie jar!\"\n\n \"Use\" their movement? Well, I'll certainly point out that the language used by homophobes is very similar to the language used by racists, and that the anti-gay marriage rhetoric is almost identical to the anti-mixed race marriage rhetoric. If that's what you mean by \"use\" then sure, I've done that. However, I suspect you mean something else, so why don't you spell it out and don't make me guess. What form is this \"usage\" supposed to have taken? And please, show actuall usage and not your infered usage, ok?",

   "Doma is uncostitution If one state recognises marriages from one state they should recognise all marriages for that same state and not be allowed to pick and choose.\n What you forget is that you are still a citizen of the united states regaurdless of wich state you live in.

Do you think general electric is not a corporation because it was not incororated in Alaska? Or the say the state of nebraska doesn't have to recognise the legalgaity of your will made in New York state? DO you really think thses things?\n Well GE isn't a corp. in Alaska...it probably is Delaware. But say GE moves, it would have to re-incorporate in the new state...it won't just recognize what another state has already done. And to explain why DOMA is not unconstitional I found a person that explains things a lot better then I could. It obvious has to do with the Full Faith and Credit Clause so here you go...\n \nActually, this is an inaccurate statement of prevailing law. It is true that existing choice-of-law rules in most states recognize marriages validly celebrated in sister states, even if such a marriage could not legally be celebrated in the forum state. However, this general rule comes with an \"escape clause\": the \"public policy exception\" allows states to disregard marriages valid in other states if giving effect to such marriages in the forum state would be contrary to the strong public policy of the forum state. Historically, this exception has been invoked against polygamy, under-age marriage, and miscegenation (prior to Loving). It will now no doubt be invoked against same-sex marriage. \n \n The Supreme Court is unlikely to find anything wrong with states refusing to recognize the marriage of other states, quite independently of DOMA. In general, there are almost no restrictions on when forum states can apply their own law, even to events or transactions that occurred out of state. See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hague, 449 U.S. 302 (1981); but see Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797 (1985) (stating that there are restrictions, without articulating what those restrictions might be).

If that definition does not protect all people equally, then it does not satisfy the fourteenth amendment. The amendment is worded so broadly that there's nothing more to it.\n \n So considering marriage, one might attempt to write off at technicality, the idea that \"everyone can get married\", which is true. But that is a diversion. The fact that everyone can get married has nothing to do with whether marriage covers everyone equally.\n \n The fact is that marriage currently has a restriction which prevents two people of the same-sex from marrying. There can be no denying that this restrictions exists for no other purpose than to prevent marriage from being used by homosexuals. Denying same-sex marriage does nothing but prevent homosexuals from marrying, and marriage therefore, even though everyone has the ability to marry, our current restrictions on marriage treat homosexuals unequally. It is a violation of the fourteenth amendment.\n \n Regarding ten-year-olds, the case could be made that ten-year-olds have not yet satisified the requirements for marriage, but because every person must go through this same waiting period, this treats no one unequally. But another argument could be made that we are treating people unequally based on their age. The amendment is unclear in this sense, but it may very well protect the rights of ten-year-olds to marry. If this is the case, then I am glad we have activist judges to interpret the Constitution based on its spirit, rather than its exact wording.\n \n \nPrecedent which is based in the constitution.

But that precedent was used to say that one state does not have to recognize the marriage of another, which I can indeed see coming from the Constitution.\n \n As for the fourteenth amendment protecting the right of women to vote, it absolutely did and does. However our laws don't always reflect the protections of the Constitutions, or sometimes activist judges rule that certain amendments were never intended to protect that which they specifically claim to protect.\n \n For this reason, perhaps you can understand why even though I fully believe that the fourteenth amendment guarantees everyone equal marriage rights, I would be in complete support of adding an additional amendment to state that specifically, just as another amendment was added to specifically guarantee voting rights for women.",

   "You are using \"begging the question\". I would also like to see where it was written broadly and the reasoning for this. To me it is pretty straight forward about what the 14th amendment was written for and about. It defines what a citizen is, it states that the same laws apply to everyone equally, and it says you can't have your fundamental rights (life, liberty, property) taken away without DUE PROCESS. It goes on to say some other stuff but at the end I find it interesting that it says \" The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\"...maybe some food for thought there.\n\n \n I am only begging the question if you do not see how it is written broadly, which I had thought clear. Allow me to quote the 14th Amendment:\n \n \"nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n \n Does this statement not seem broad to you? Could this statement not be applied to just about any political issue? Instead of picking out a single issue, such as the right of women to vote, this statement was written broadly; it must apply to every law, every issue, every decision the state governments make. Can we now agree that this statement is written broadly?\n \n You mentioned that the 14th Amendment says the same laws must protect everyone equally. That's pretty much correct; according to the fourteenth amendment, the laws must protect everyone equally. Although one might try to avoid the question of equality by saying, \"everyone can marry\", that statement says nothing about whether our marriage laws protect everyone equally. The reality of the situation is that denying same-sex marriage while we have opposite-sex marriage does not protect homosexuals equally.\n \n I should also say that this phrase does protect the right of women to vote. So far as I know, the Constitution itself says nothing like \"only white male landowners get to vote\"; it does suggest that slaves count as 3/5 of a person when determining the number of representatives each state recieves, but as far as voting, it really says nothing more than \"the people of the states will decide\" or \"the states will decide\" or something like that. If it did say that women were not allowed to vote, then there would be a conflict in the Constitution, which would most likely be resolved with the assertion that the newer addition (the 14th Amendment) overrides the older words of the Constitution.",

   "No, because it wasn't written broadly...what is so broad about that?\n\n \n It is broad because it does not apply specifically to a single issue but to any issue, including marriage. How do you figure that this is not broad?\n \n \nStates give equal protection of the laws...that means the laws of the states apply to the people in an equal way. Murder for one person is the same as the next.\n\n \n No, untrue, and incorrect. You are right when you say that states must give equal protection of the laws. And you're right when you say that the states' laws must apply to people in an equal way. But you are absolutely wrong when you say that this means murder for one person is the same as murder for the next. \"The same\" is not the same thing as \"equal.\"\n \n Let us use your murder example. Let's say that our laws defined murder as \"killing anyone except Steve.\" We could run with these laws and apply them the same to anyone. If you kill someone who isn't Steve, then that's murder. But this does not constitute equal protection of the laws. The rights of Steven are not equally protected. In this case, certain restrictions on our definition of \"murder\" cause that law to treat people unfairly. In the same fashion, I could define murder as \"killing a white person\". Again, although our laws are the same for everyone, they are not equally protecting minority races.\n \n So keep this in mind: restrictions on our rights may cause laws which are applied the same to everyone to still treat people unfairly and unequally. And in the same fashion that restricting killing minority races constitutes unequal treatment for minorities, restricting homosexual marriage constitutes unequal protection for homosexuals.\n \n And keep in mind that this amendment was passed in response to the civil rights movement, as an effort to guarantee rights for black people. If we use your words, then I can simply add restrictions against black people to any right I want, then apply that law to everyone the same way, and that doesn't violate the fourteenth amendment. I could say, \"freedom of speech means you can say what you like if your skin is white.\" The right to bear arms is defined as white people being allowed to carry weapons. Marriage is a union between two white people. Do you see how adding a restriction to these laws, then applying them the same to everyone doesn't actually constitute equal treatment?\n \n \nCanno't deprive people of life, liberty, and property without due process is not broad either. In fact it is rather specific. It gives three direct rights that cannot be denied without due process of law. You might say well what does \"life, liberty, and property\" mean? Not very hard, it means what it meant when it was written. The people that wrote/adopted it didn't say \"well, we don't know what it means but lets but it in there and have unelected judges decide what it means\".\n\n \n I understand; the \"life, liberty, and property\" piece of the fourteenth amendment is irrelevant to our current discussion. The important piece is the \"nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\".\n \n I should also point out that you use \"unelected\" as though it is a bad thing, which is not true; judges are unelected for good reason.\n \n \nThis is not true. Marriage has one meaning. The law applies to all equally. A gay man is allowed to marry just like a women is. Now, it does restrict who you can marry but it restricts this for everyone. If you look at the history and reason this amendment was passed it is not hard to figure out that it was one of the slavery amendments. The goal was to make blacks citizens (by defining what a citizen is) and then saying that all people get the same laws.\n\n \n It is true that our current legal definition of marriage restricts who you can marry for everyone. However, this is no different in any fashion than restricting marriage based on sexual orientation. The entire purpose of that restriction is to stop homosexuals from marrying. And that is the entire effect. It may be true that we've written \"you can't marry someone of the same sex\", but the effects of that are exactly the same in every way as saying \"you can't marry someone if you're gay\". Because they have the same effects, then they must bring with them the same inequality.\n \n As I said, stating that marriage is applied to everyone in the same way means nothing. You can repeat that if you like, but it will not matter. The fact is that we have a restriction on marriage which prevents homosexual people from using it. If we apply this restriction to everyone in the same way, then straight people will be unaffected while homosexual people will be unable to marry. Applying this restriction in the same fashion to everyone is not equal. How can a restriction which stops some people from marrying but allows others to marry ever be equal?\n \n As for the amendment, I know the history. I know that it was created after discrimination against African Americans. However I also know that the sentence in question does not say anything about race. There is a reason it does not; the authors of the amendment wanted it to apply to race and more. If you are going to consider the history of the amendment, then consider that this amendment was intended not only to prevent discrimination in the time it was written, but also to prevent discrimination in future generations.\n \n \nIf one looks at the constitution as ratified then the amendment is very clear and not broad at all. It surely was not meant as a tool for judges to decide policy cases that are not mean't to be in the constitution (such as marriage or abortion).\n\n \n The amendment is very clear. \"Clear\" is not the opposite of \"broad\". Specific is the opposite of broad. And that amendment is not specific; it doesn't apply to any single, specific issue or feature, such as race. It applies to every law, every time. If it wasn't supposed to apply to marriage or abortion, then they would be listed as exceptions. But no exception was listed.\n \n No state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n \n This amendment was not intended to apply only to a single issue. In my opinion, the authors of the 14th Amendment would be horrified to see judges rolling over and allowing Congress to violate this amendment simply because that judge didn't want it to apply to anything besides race. It wasn't meant as a tool for judges, it was meant as a restriction on the power of the government, a way to prevent the government from becoming too powerful and from preferring one group over another. And in this case, heterosexuals are unquestionably being preferred over homosexuals. Judges are merely the people responsible for assuring that the government doesn't create that sort of preference.\n \n The amendment is written as it is for a reason, and if we read it as it is written, then we must allow same-sex marriage.\n \n Understand that you support judicial activism; as soon as you say \"It surely was not meant...\", you're inserting your opinion of why the amendment was created; you're not reading what it actually says. And your opinion is certainly very different than mine.\n \n Now this doesn't make your opinion wrong; maybe marriage is something the authors couldn't predict, and maybe the amendment shouldn't apply to marriage. But that is an activist idea, it is you interpreting the intentions of the authors, and it is not based on the words of the Constitution.\n \n As for abortion, well I find it far more likely that this amendment would be used to ban abortion than to allow it, but that is another discussion.",

   "\n It is broad because it does not apply specifically to a single issue but to any issue, including marriage. How do you figure that this is not broad?\n Just look at the history of the amendment and what they were trying to accomplish. They weren't thinking anything about marriage or abortion. It did deal with one single issue and this was to provide equal protection of the laws to the people (for that one clause). That isn't broad at all.\n \n \nLet us use your murder example. Let's say that our laws defined murder as \"killing anyone except Steve.\" We could run with these laws and apply them the same to anyone. If you kill someone who isn't Steve, then that's murder. But this does not constitute equal protection of the laws. The rights of Steven are not equally protected. In this case, certain restrictions on our definition of \"murder\" cause that law to treat people unfairly. In the same fashion, I could define murder as \"killing a white person\". Again, although our laws are the same for everyone, they are not equally protecting minority races.\n Funny you say this...We do have a laws that says murder is killing any person except unborns. Nevertheless, when I said \"same\" I mean't it as how you use equal. murder laws have to protect everyone in the same manner might be a better way to say it. In other words when the steve murder law I wouldn't have an equal protection not to get killed from my peers and government like other citizens(people) do. However, I do believe protection is a key word here and this is why it doesn't apply to marraige. The state doesn't say everyone can marry but gays. Gays can marry. Everyone is protected in that sense and it really doesn't single anyone out even if you can restrict who can marry. Like the 10 year old example, marrige can be restricted as long as this applies in a reasonably equal manner. Now what if the marriage laws said \"marriage is between a man and women or between two white men only\". Would this violate the 14th amendment in my view? Well yes it would. This restriction doesn't restrict in an equal manner. It restricts marriage for some and doesn't for others. See the difference there? \n \n \n\n I understand; the \"life, liberty, and property\" piece of the fourteenth amendment is irrelevant to our current discussion. The important piece is the \"nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\".\n \n I should also point out that you use \"unelected\" as though it is a bad thing, which is not true; judges are unelected for good reason.\n Ok, for purposes we will leave out the due process clause :). I think unelected judges are a good thing if they don't abuse this power. Which I believe they have. I have some rough thoughts on what it should be...maybe have an annimous committee made up of lawyers and judges with some term limit that a President appoints (and no one knows who they are) and they pick a judge who is then approved by Congress...I dunno, but the system now is getting too political.\n \n \nThe amendment is very clear. \"Clear\" is not the opposite of \"broad\". Specific is the opposite of broad. And that amendment is not specific; it doesn't apply to any single, specific issue or feature, such as race. It applies to every law, every time. If it wasn't supposed to apply to marriage or abortion, then they would be listed as exceptions. But no exception was listed.\n They weren't listed as exceptions because they don't apply anyway. Abortion mainly. It is clear and specific then when adopted it meant ONE thing and ONE thing only. So to change what it means would be to make a new law in a way. \n \n \nUnderstand that you support judicial activism; as soon as you say \"It surely was not meant...\", you're inserting your opinion of why the amendment was created; you're not reading what it actually says.

But that is an activist idea, it is you interpreting the intentions of the authors, and it is not based on the words of the Constitution.\n Who said I am not for activist judges? I think Scalia put it best \"I support a judge activily doing what he is supposed to do\". I pretty much follow Scalia's stance on the constitution if you wish to know. He seems to be the most consistent one. I think orginial intentions and the written text and traditions are the best way to determine what was meant by the amendment and what it applies to today. Judges can't determine what liberties \"liberty\" meant in the due process clause, I feel this is already defined and can be easily seen in the traditions and writtings of the people who adopted the 14th amendment. You have a right to free speech but in the traditions and meaning of the first amendment, liable speech is something you can restrict while flag burning is something you can't.",

But there's absolutely a caveat that says \"except illegal activity.\" It says, \"without due process of law\". Basically, you can't deny someone's liberty without giving him a trial.

They want to limit the power of the government in case of doubt.\n \n \nAnd so people today, when they want to be able to do something that society frowns upon, latch onto the only vague amendment they can that can be used to claim their behavior is constitutional.\n\n \n Absolutely.

That is the entirety of the purpose of this amendment: to protect the rights of people that society frowns upon.

As soon as we put marriage into our laws, it was written to address marriage. There should be no doubt about that. The authors and approvers of this amendment knew that it would apply to every law. They wrote it so that it would apply to every law. Look at the words:\n \n \"nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n \n No state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

   " yeah marriage is left up to the states...however, federal income tax has a part for joint filings. In order to do a joint filing you must be married under the definition that the federal government provides. And you have yet to show how the 14th amendment is violated. The equal protection clause is not because everyone is equally protected under the marriage laws. Anyone that wishes to marry can do so. Now marriage has a definition just like murder does so this restricts some things. You know people who are 10 can not marry either. But it equally says everyone who is 10 can't get married.\n\n \n And this is where you run into problems.

   "For one thing the federal government is treating some married couples differently than others. The marrieages are equal under the law. To now restrict benefits based on the gender of the particiants of the couples invilved is clearly unconstitutional.\n \n\n states provide equal protection of the laws..never the less, you can restrict marriage in this way for the reasons provided in the above posts...The same way one can restrict marriage on a 10 year old and say an 17yr old can't smoke but a 18yr old can. No one is restricted from marrying..they are just restricted in who they can marry.\n \n \nMarriage & abortion are \"policy issues\"? \n You think they are not? The constitution only lays out a few basic rights and leaves the rest to policy makers...thus policy issues...marriage being on of those and abortion as well. Privacy is not in the constitution but there are specific areas where privacy exists the rest is policy.\n \n \nActually it does help me. If two couples move from Massachusetts move to Ohio, for Ohio to now accept one marriage and not the other is blatantly unconstitutional based on the 14th amendment. According to MA, both contracts are identical. OH cannot void the second contract.\n \n The full faith and credit clause is not in the 14th amendment emoticon_rolleyes I still suggest you read my post some posts back about it.\n \n \nAs long as a state recognizes one specific type of contract from another state, then it has to recognize all contracts of that specific type. To refuse to recognize a contract from one couple and not another violates FF&C\n This is just not true and I don't know to state it any other way. \n \n See Nevada v Hall where they said the Full Faith and Credit clause does...\n \nnot here enable one state to legislate for the other or to project its laws across state lines so as to preclude the other from prescribing for itself the legal consequences of acts within it\n\n http://www.ag.state.mi.us/opinion/datafiles/2000s/op10236.htm",

No one is restricted from marrying..they are just restricted in who they can marry.\n\n \n Yet if we restrict people from marrying certain people in such a fashion that those restrictions will cause some people to not marry at all, then we are creating the exact same effect as restricting people from marrying, and the same inequality is thus created.\n \n It is a devious tactic; instead of saying specifically that we are denying gay people the right to marry, we simply deny them the ability to marry certain people. Yet we have chosen those people such that this restriction does nothing more than completely inhibit the gay person's right to marry while leaving the straight person's right to marriage untouched.\n \n We all know very well who is denied the right to marry and who is not. Let's be done with the illusions and twistings of words so that our debates can continue with the intention of honesty.\n \n \nYou think they are not? The constitution only lays out a few basic rights and leaves the rest to policy makers...thus policy issues...marriage being on of those and abortion as well.\n\n \n This is not correct. The Constitution lists the powers of the government. The government is allowed to act on those few powers and nothing more. The Constitution gives the government no power to create marriage, nor any power to deny marriage between any two people. As such, the government technically has no power to do so.\n \n The Constitution does not allow the government to do anything it wants (unless protected in the Bill of Rights). The Bill of Rights and amendments guarantee that the government never violates those rights using the powers it was granted, but it does not give the government the power to restrict unlisted rights. It only gives the government the power to do that which is specifically written, and the power to do anything marriage-related was not listed in the Constitution.\n \n If you are not familiar with The Federalist Papers, they are the writings of the Federalists. The Federalists were the authors and supporters of the Constitution. The Anti-Federalists were opponents of the Constitution, for various reasons. Many Anti-Federalists wanted to add a Bill of Rights. The Federalists did not (though the Bill of Rights was eventually written by James Madison, one of the three authors of the Federalist Papers).\n \n Anyhow, in the Federalist Papers, the argument against a Bill of Rights is explained in detail. One of the reasons they oppose it is because it will change the way people think from \"here's what the government can do; they can't do anything else\" to \"here's what the government can't do; they have unlimited power to do anything else\". That is bad; that gives the government the power to tyrannize the people, to take away any rights unlisted. This is explained in Federalist Paper no 84, if you wish to research it. Here is a quote:\n \n \nI go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted; and on this very account, would afford a colourable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why for instance, should it be said, that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that power. They might urge with a semblance of reason, that the constitution ought not to be charged with the absurdity of providing against the abuse of an authority, which was not given, and that the provision against restraining the liberty of the press afforded a clear implication, that a power to prescribe proper regulations concerning it, was intended to be vested in the national government. This may serve as a specimen of the numerous handles which would be given to the doctrine of constructive powers, by the indulgence of an injudicious zeal for bills of rights.\n\n \n From this, it should be evident that the Constitution absolutely did not \"lay out a few basic rights and leave the rest to the policy makers.\" In fact, it did just the opposite: it laid out a few basic laws policy makers can create, then considered the rest rights held by the people.",

   "Okay, so what about the ninth and tenth amendments, hmm?\n\n \n They seem to spell things out pretty clearly without subjectives, IMO.\n \n \nA criminal could absolutely claim that. But there's absolutely a caveat that says \"except illegal activity.\" It says, \"without due process of law\". Basically, you can't deny someone's liberty without giving him a trial. So according to the amendment, as long as we have a trial, we can absolutely deny life, liberty, and property (but not the equal protection of the laws).\n\n \n So, you'd want a trial for every gay person wanting the liberty to marry? It seems to me that if you use the \"due process\" clause here, you should apply it consistently.\n \n \nNo, they knew exactly that anyone and everyone could say that anything constitutes \"liberty\" or \"equality\". That's why they implemented it. \n\n \n I seriously doubt it. It wasn't to be a one-size-fits all amendment. Do you actually think the framers did not intend it to be about citizen's rights of black people? They did. And to assume more than that is to . . . well, be an activist judge.\n \n \nIf there is any doubt at all, they want to err in favor of freedom and equality. They want to limit the power of the government in case of doubt.\n\n \n But regulating states from deciding who can marry, and extending the federal govt.'s role into the realm of marriage in the first place is hardly \"limiting\" the role of the govt. It makes it more intrusive. \n \n \nAbsolutely. This amendment was designed to protect people that society frowns upon. At the time, it was protecting black people. Today it protects homosexuals.\n\n \n But the issue isn't who's being protected, but what the protections ARE. Why should \"liberty\" in the 14th Amendment get to include any sort of romantic marriage that comes along? It seems to me the ONLY thing you have to point to in that Amendment to hang your gay-marriage hat on is that word \"liberty.\" That's pretty subjective.",

You freely admit here that it discriminates based on sexual orientation. Since discrimination indicates unequal treatment, what doubt can there be that the fourteenth amendment is violated? Your conclusion, should you be factoring in the fourteenth amendment, should be that both discrimination based on age and sexual orientation are unconstitutional.\n \n Your evidence doesn't rest in the constitution, it rests in a comparison to marriage restrictions based on age. Yet I do not accept that marriage restrictions based on age are necessarily constitutional, and you have not provided reason for me to believe it.\n \n That being said, a case could be made that marriage restrictions based on age are actually constitutional, for each of us must go through a period of life before we are granted these rights.

You would be correct if that power were delegated to the states. However, you would be incorrect if it were given to the people, for that would mean that the people have the power to use marriage as they please.\n \n Looking at the ninth amendment, we can see that the enumeration of rights in the Constitution shall not be contrued to deny or disparage other rights retained by the people. Since I consider marriage to be a right of the people, I consider it retained by the people, and therefore delegated by the tenth amendment to the people, not the states.\n \n Or perhaps it is possible that the ninth and tenth amendment are simply too vague to tell us anything about states' rights. However, it is DOMA you mentioned above that you consider constitutional. DOMA is a restriction put in place by the Federal Government. In this light, doesn't it appear that the federal government has acted outside of its power, unconstitutionally in creating DOMA? Surely the federal government has no power to do so.\n \n States, on the other hand, are specifically not allowed to deny anyone the equal protection of the laws as described in the fourteenth amendment, which means that, for the sake of our current discussion, they are not allowed to deny same-sex marriage whether the power to do so was initially granted them or not.\n \n \nFunny you mention the Federalist papers...many of which I have read...You should read the ones on the judicial branch ;) I agree that they wanted the federal government restricted...not the government in general.

If you wanted to reference a chapter in the Federalist Papers specifically, I would read it, certainly.\n \n But don't feel too obligated to do that. I will take your word for it; and even run with the idea that states are granted the power to create an institution such as marriage. I was focused primarily on the Federal level and the idea that the Constitution \"leaves the rest up to the policy makers\". Whether states have the power to create marriage is not important, for states are, I have contended, disallowed from denying same-sex marriage by the fourteenth amendment.\n \n \nBy the way, the Anti-Federalist Papers were pretty much dead on when it comes to how the judicial branch will end up :).\n\n \n I cannot recall which arguments against the judicial system you're referring to, but I believe it is operating as the Federalists intended it, at least. The judicial branch, though occasionally overstepping its power, is doing so in a fashion that appropriately balances the power of the government. It is protecting the rights of the people, and it is limiting the power of the government. That is the purpose it should be serving, and though it is overstepping its power in some cases (abortion?), such reaches for power were expected by the Federalists in all branches.\n \n If anything, I would point out that the Anti-Federalists were more correct with their predictions of what would happen with the Congress and President. They predicted that these people would become tyrants who overstep the powers granted them in the Constitution, dictators with the power to do pretty much anything they want. Though I suppose the Federalists themselves predicted that this might happen with the addition of a Bill of Rights.\n \n \nI wouldn't try to lecture me on the federalist papers though...I have a great interest in them (lets put it that way).\n\n \n I don't mean to lecture you, just to offer an introduction in the case that you were unfamiliar with them, then use them as evidence against the idea that Constitution protects a small set of rights, then leaves the rest up to lawmakers.",

   "They seem to spell things out pretty clearly without subjectives, IMO.\n\n \n Ah, then it is the terms \"life, liberty and property\" you are concerned with? Life and property seem pretty clear to me. Liberty is generally referred to as the right to do something.\n \n \nSo, you'd want a trial for every gay person wanting the liberty to marry? It seems to me that if you use the \"due process\" clause here, you should apply it consistently.\n\n \n Due process only applies when the government is trying to take away someone's live, liberty or property. The phrase about life, liberty and property in the 14th Amendment says nothing about same-sex marriage, for it could be considered due process to pass a law against same-sex marriage, then to try anyone engaging in same-sex marriage as a criminal.\n \n The part of the 14th Amendment which mandates same-sex marriage is the part about equal protection of the laws.\n \n \nI seriously doubt it. It wasn't to be a one-size-fits all amendment. Do you actually think the framers did not intend it to be about citizen's rights of black people? They did. And to assume more than that is to . . . well, be an activist judge.\n\n \n There is no assumption about it. If the creaters of the fourteenth amendment wanted it to be about black people, they would have said, \"black people\". Do you honestly think they did not know that this would be applied to every law? Do you really think that the authors were thinking \"Oh, I'll just leave out skin color alltogether, everyone will know that the addition 'but this only applies to skin color and race!' was supposed to be at the end.\"\n \n Reading the words of the amendment, it applies to every law. If a state's law does protect everyone equally, then it is violates the fourteenth amendment. That is the bottom line.\n \n Your ideas that the amendment means something different than is written are activist by definition. You assume to know that the authors and approvers of the amendment meant something different than they wrote. You are suggesting that they miswrote the amendment or that they couldn't possibly have predicted what the words would mean in today's society. That is the definition of activism.\n \n Reading the exact words in the Constitution, as I have done, is the definition of strict constitutionalism.\n \n \nBut regulating states from deciding who can marry, and extending the federal govt.'s role into the realm of marriage in the first place is hardly \"limiting\" the role of the govt.

State governments are just extensions of the federal government. If the government can no longer regulate marriage, then our government becomes less intrusive. If the government does regulate marriage, it becomes more intrusive.\n \n The fact that one branch of the government is overpowering a different branch of the government has nothing to do with how limited or intrusive the government is.\n \n \nBut the issue isn't who's being protected, but what the protections ARE.

It seems to me the ONLY thing you have to point to in that Amendment to hang your gay-marriage hat on is that word \"liberty.\" That's pretty subjective.\n\n \n Again, it is not liberty.

   "The conclusion for age is what you wrote down at the end. Everyone must follow the RULE and thus it is not a violation because it is done equally. The same can be said of gay marriage too. Everyone must follor the RULE that they can't marry someone of the same sex. Everyone is equal in this manner. The only way to not make it equal would be to say if a person is gay they can't marry at all (as in to no one). This is where you violate the 14th amendment.\n\n \n The rule regarding age can be considered equal. So when we say everyone must follow that rule, we might be instituting equality. However the rule denying people to marry based on their gender combinations is not equal; that rule denies marriage to some, but not to others. So when we apply it to everyone, the result is inequality. When we force everyone to follow an equal rule, we end up with equality. When we force everyone to follow an unequal one, we end up with inequality.\n \n As you said, it would certainly be unequal to say that gay people cannot marry. But what we've done is come up with a loophole. Since we can't target gay people, we'll just work around it. We don't say gay people can't get married, we just say there can be no gay marriages. The result is exactly the same. Gay people are not allowed to marry, straight people are, and it is still unequal. Forcing everyone to follow the same rule doesn't make that rule equal.\n \n In the same light, I could say that denying interracial marriage is legal. We could go back to the murder example. I could say \"murder is defined as the killing of a white person.\" Again, we're instituting that rule upon everyone, but it doesn't make that rule equal. Tell me: do you really think it is equal to make murder only a crime if a white person is killed? How could anyone could anyone really call that equal?\n \n \nThis doesn't matter...and court cases have backed this up. Because it says \"or\" the states have the power and can use it.\n \n The 9th amendment can only be taken on tradition because that amendment is vague and worthless.\n\n \n The tenth amendment doesn't say which one, and I'm sure you'll agree that courts have made wrong decisions in the past. The ninth amendment was almost certainly created to prevent people from assuming that the government has the power to take away or regulate any right it wants. I think that the right to marry should not be an exception.\n \n \nDOMA just says marriage is left up to the states but for the purposes of the government marriage will be defined as between a man and women. I don't see anything wrong with this. It says marriage is left up to the states! The federal government is allowed to determine things regarding federal matters though, such as tax policy when filing a joint tax return. Still not unconstitutional.\n\n \n Okay, I should first say that the federal government doesn't have the power to decide what happens to marriage, and that means it also doesn't have the power to delegate marriage to the states.\n \n But more importantly, it doesn't just say that marriage is left up to the states. It also says \"for the purposes of the federal government, marriage will be defined as between a man and a woman.\" That is regulating marriage! It's cleverly hidden behind the statement that the states will decide marriage, but there it is, right there.\n \n The federal government has decided what marriage is, and it will distribute tax benefits and recognition based on that decision. How does the federal government have the power to do this? The federal government may have the power to determine how to calculate taxes when filing jointly, but to do this, it has defined marriage as something other than what the states decide it to be. It's come up with its own, federal marriage. It has no power to do this.\n \n \nLet me ask you this...You say balance of power, do you believe the federalists intended to have the three branches have an equal balance of power or does one have more power than the other?\n\n \n The most powerful branch should be the legislative branch, as their power is checked by the majority, the other members of the legislature, and the other branches of government. The next most powerful branch should be the President, and the least powerful should be the Judicial branch.\n \n However, although the judicial branch should be the least powerful, this does not mean that the judicial branch should sometimes fail to protect rights guaranteed in the Constitution, nor does it mean that activism isn't appropriate (though I believe it is a strict constitutionalist decision to support same-sex marriage).\n \n \nActually, I feel bad about that comment...you weren't lecturing and that was kind of degrading for me to say. I am sorry about that.\n\n \n Think nothing of it. We all say things like that sometimes. I've probably done it numerous times already. It is understandable, and no apology is necessary.",

   "There is no assumption about it. If the creaters of the fourteenth amendment wanted it to be about black people, they would have said, \"black people\". Do you honestly think they did not know that this would be applied to every law?

Th reason I say this it because Warren's decision here could be used to say 10yr olds can marry 50 yr olds. We should investigate this further when I get back :)\n\n \n By the time you return, I may be finished posting on these forums for the rest of the day, so I'll present my opinion now, you can respond, then you may need to wait until tomorrow for my next response.\n \n I agree with Warren for the most part, though there are two places I disagree. Warren wrote that the clear and central purpose of the fourteenth amendment was race-related. I disagree. Although race problems most certainly accounted for the creation of the amendment, and although its effects on racial issues are most immediate and apparent, the wording of the amendment makes it clear that it is intended to extend to all laws, not just those which are race-related.\n \n Second, Warren also wrote that the laws against interracial marriage violate the due process clause. I do not see how this is, though I may misunderstand exactly how those laws worked or what he meant by that.\n \n Beyond those two things, I think I agree with what Warren wrote there. I would like to call out this paragraph:\n \nThere is patently no legitimate overriding purpose independent of invidious racial discrimination which justifies this classification. The fact that Virginia prohibits only interracial marriages involving white persons demonstrates that the racial classifications must stand on their own justification, as measures designed to maintain White Supremacy. We have consistently denied the constitutionality of measures which restrict the rights of citizens on account of race. There can be no doubt that restricting the freedom to marry solely because of racial classifications violates the central meaning of the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n I would say precisely the same thing about gender classifications. There is patently no legitimate overriding purpose independent of invidioius sexual orientation discrimination which justifies this classification. The fact that some states prohbit marriages between members of the same sex demonstrates that demonstrates that sexual orientation classifications must stand on their own justification, as measures designed to maintain heterosexual supremacy. There can be no doubt that restricting the freedom to marry solely because of gender classifications violates the central meaning of the Equal Protection Clause.\n \n We can see some of Warren's activism here as well, and it is well-reasoned activism. About racial classifications, he says \"if they are ever to be upheld, they must be shown to be necessary to the accomplishment of some permissible state objective...\" This sentence suggests that he might support violating the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment if there were some reasonable state objective, some benefit to the people of the state from making that classification. But in the case of denying interracial marriage, there is no benefit to anyone.\n \n I can understand this sort of activism. If there were any reasonable reason for denying same-sex marriage, if there were any logic behind it, or if anyone was benefitted by taking away the rights of homosexuals, I'd be at least slightly inclined to say, \"okay, maybe the equal protection clause shouldn't apply to this, let's let the lawmakers determine what is best for everyone.\"\n \n But there simply is no good reason to deny same-sex marriage. No one is sees any benefit from it, and homosexuals are harmed. Denying same-sex marriage, like denying interracial marriage, isn't a restriction bred in the best interest of the state, it is a restriction bred in intolerance of homosexuals and same-sex relationships. Maybe that intolerance is part of some people's religions. But that doesn't mean it is anything more than intolerance, and it doesn't mean someone benefits from denying same-sex marriage.\n \n You mentioned that Warren should have mentioned tradition. But I don't think that is relevant at all. Marriage in America had traditionally been between to members of the same race. So should we move back to other cultures? Which one would we choose? In some, marriage was traditionally arranged by parents. In others, interracial marriage was looked down on.\n \n Besides, is there really any good reason to look to tradition? We're looking back on traditions of slavery, tyrannical kings and emperors, wars fought for trivial reasons, intolerance of people of different religions and races, and a million other bad precedents. America has long set the precedent of equality and freedom, in a world where none previously existed.\n \n So do we now ask our judges to rule against the word of the Constitution, to rule against equality, and to rule against the best interest of the people, all for the sake of satisfying a discriminatory tradition? I cannot do that.\n \n \nmy point was the \"construed\" part though. The constitution can't be construed...\n \n Does this not mean that saying something is in the constitution that isn't would be construing it? This has nothing to do with gay marriage by the way (in fact more to do with the 'right to privacy')\n\n \n Well, the ninth amendment doesn't say that the Constitution cannot be construed. It says that the Constitution cannot be construed to disparage or deny rights unlisted. Or in (hopefully) more simple terms, we can't interpret the constitution to disparage or deny rights, simply because those rights aren't listed.",

That's yet another reason why I believe it is not appropriate to think of the 14th in the all-encompassing way that you do that allows any relationship arrangement to be given the equal protection of marriage.\n\n \n If everyone read the Constitution as it is written, then there would have been no need for the 19th Amendment. But there are activist judges, and there are people who wish to guess at the intent of the authors, and there are people who wish to mold the Constitution to fit their own opinion. And what's more: sometimes those people are right.\n \n The 14th Amendment protects the right of women to vote, but up until the 19th Amendment, both the courts and the legislature were activist enough that they did not recognize that fact, and as such, it was helpful to spell out the rights of women specifically. In the same fashion, although I am I certain the 14th Amendment already protects the right of same-sex couples to marry, I would be completely in support of an amendment to spell out that equality specifically.\n \n But this goes back to the problem that Hamilton (in the Federalist Papers) spoke of in the quote I wrote earlier. An amendment to protect a right seems like a good idea to those passing the Amendment at the time, that they should specifically guarantee the rights of women to vote, for example. But they fail to consider that as soon as they create this, people will assume that this right couldn't possibly have been protected previously in the Constitution. Therefore, people looking to extend the influence of the government will suggest that the government must have previously had the authority to take away those rights, for otherwise there would have been no need for an amendment that protects them. But in reality, no such authority had been given.\n \n \nThe Federal govt. does things all the time that they don't have specifically-spelled-out power to do in the constitution. The govt. doesn't need the constitution to spell out on that issue for it to act.\n\n \n It doesn't because no one questions it, not today. But both the Constitution and the writings of the authors of the Constitution make it completely clear that the government has no powers outside of those listed, and any attempt to act outside those powers should be deemed unconstitutional by the courts. A lot of what our federal government does today is unconstitutional.\n \n It is the argument I spoke of above against the Bill of Rights. The Federalists (supporters of the Constitution) did not want to add a Bill of Rights because it would change people's view of the Constitution. Instead of thinking \"the Constitution lists what the government can do, and it can do nothing else\", people would start thinking \"here's what the government can't do, and it can do everything else.\" The Federalists were right that this would happen, as your current misunderstanding of the government's authority proves.\n \n \nYou're right, the constitution does not promote anarchy, which is why your view is a misuse of the constitution. You're view is for essentially taking anything that comes along and being able to call it marriage based on the 14th amendment.\n\n \n This statement is very wrong.\n \n First, anarchy is the lack of government. If I supported the idea that marriage should be \"anything that comes along\", this would have nothing to do with anarchy. It would mean that I have lessened the restrictions on marriage to the point that it can be applied to any group of people. But that has absolutely nothing to do with the lack of a government or the lack of laws. If we know nothing about a government besides the fact that anything that comes along is allowed to marry, then we could be certain that this government is not an anarchy, for at least one set of laws (marriage laws) exists. Although allowing anything that comes along to marry has nothing to do with anarchy, it might have something to do with freedom, equality and happiness, all of which are principles strongly supported by the Constitution.\n \n Second, I do not support defining marriage as \"anything that comes along\", I support defining it in a fashion that treats both homosexuals and heterosexuals equally under the law. This doesn't mean that I support animal/human relationships or anything else so absurd. It means I support equal treatment of homosexuals and heterosexuals.\n \n Perhaps the problem is still rooted in some prejudice you hold against homosexuals. You still believe that heterosexual marriage is deserving of some sort of special treatment, and that homosexual marriage falls into your category of \"anything else that comes along.\" That's not a fair view of marriage; heterosexual marriage is no better than homosexual marriage, and heterosexual marriage constitutes \"anything else that comes along\" just as much as homosexual marriage does.\n \n \nAnd gay people have that right, as marriage is. The issue has never been that you want the right to marry (you DON'T want to marry as marriage is currently defined), but that you want to redefine it to include your kind of relationship arrangement. That's really what this is about, not the \"right to marry.\" We need to be clear about this.\n\n \n We can be clear about it. But then we must also be clear about why I want to redefine marriage. The reason is because marriage is currently defined in a fashion that, for all intents and purposes, means I will never actually use it. And in truth, it is defined in such a fashion specifically to prevent me and people like me from using it. So although I am not specifically denied the right to marriage, by putting a restriction on marriage, you have accomplished precisely the same thing as denying me marriage and you've done it for the same reasons.\n \n So the fact is: yes, I do want to redefine marriage. And I want to redefine it because it's currently defined in a fashion which prevents me from ever using it. And although you repeat the phrase that I am not denied marriage, that phrase remains nothing but a deception, for the current definition of marriage accomplishes the same thing as a direct denial.\n \n You criticize me for seeking to change the definition of marriage. Yet the current definition denies me marriage, and I seek to change that definition in no more ways than to allow myself to use it. If you imply that my changing the definition of marriage somehow affects you and your marriage, then that is again a deception, for you and your marriage are not affected.\n \n So if you again repeat the idea that I am not denied the right to marriage, then be honest about it. Follow it up with the fact that although I have the right to marry, you have defined it in such a fashion which assures that I will never use it, allowing you to cleverly prevent me from marrying while still being able to claim I have that right on a technicality. Then point out that the only thing I want to change in \"the definition of marriage\" is the part which prevents me from using it, which has no effect on you or anyone else already in a marriage. And consider the fact that if we grant everyone the same right, but that right has a restriction on it designed to prevent some people from using it, then that right does not grant equal protection of the laws. \n \n When you have mentioned those things, then you have presented the whole picture. But so long as you continue to say \"you already have the right to marry\" without recognizing the fact that your restrictions on that right prevent me from ever using it, you are presenting only a partial truth.\n \n (Yes I realize that I'm bisexual, but for the sake of the above paragraphs, pretend I'm homosexual).\n \n \nThen again, you are basically saying that anything that comes along could be a marriage, if the people involved say so, no matter how wild and \"out-there\" it is. This is not the spirit of the constitution at all.\n\n \n I have discussed this above. Not only is allowing marriage between anyone if the people involved say so most certainly in the spirit of the Constitution, but I am suggesting we do no such thing.",

Scalia is also right that some sort of rational justification for violating the equal protection clause may warrant its violation (though that is an activist thing to say).\n \n But this is his rational basis? That we should deny equal protection of the laws because of tradition? If such a tradition is enough to deny equal protection of the laws, then the fourteenth amendment granted no protection to African Americans at any time, for they faced a tradition of persecution, segregation and hatred. It is nothing less than disgusting to suggest that a tradition born of intolerance and persecuation of people different than ourselves should be considered rational justification to continue that intolerance and persecution.\n \n About O'Conner's interpretation of the Constitution, Scalia says:\n \nThis reasoning leaves on pretty shaky grounds state laws limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples.\n\n \n This is correct: using O'Conner's more correct interpretation of the Constitution, state laws limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples should be deemed unconstitutional.\n \n But Scalia counters this with:\n \nSo imbued is the Court with the law profession's anti-anti-homosexual culture, that it is seemingly unaware that the attitudes of that culture are not obviously \"mainstream\"; that in most States what the Court calls \"discrimination\" against those who engage in homosexual acts is perfectly legal; that proposals to ban such \"discrimination\" under Title VII have repeatedly been rejected by Congress, see Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1994, S. 2238, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. (1994); Civil Rights Amendments, H. R. 5452, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. (1975); that in some cases such \"discrimination\" is mandated by federal statute, see 10 U. S. C. \u00a7654(b)(1) (mandating discharge from the armed forces of any service member who engages in or intends to engage in homosexual acts); and that in some cases such \"discrimination\" is a constitutional right, see Boy Scouts of America v. Dale\n\n \n So instead of using the Constitution as his jusitification, he uses a bunch of existing laws, none of which may necessarily hold any Constitutional backing at all.\n \n The only attempt he does make to incorporate the Constitution is the Boy Scouts of America v. Dale case. In that case, the rights of individuals and private groups to discriminate against homosexuals was maintained. But this says nothing about the right of our laws to discriminate. While individuals certainly do have the right to discriminate, our constitution could be no more clear that every person has the right to equal protection of the laws. Our laws cannot discriminate. And I think Scalia recognizes this distinction. He is grasping for justification where none exists, and I think he knows it. Or in a more gentle fashion: this is intended to appear to the reader as hard evidence supporting Scalia's point, but I think Scalia recognizes that this is loosely related information, none of which proves his point in any fashion.\n \n And here is another of Scalia's fatal flaws:\n \nI would no more require a State to criminalize homosexual acts--or, for that matter, display any moral disapprobation of them--than I would forbid it to do so. What Texas has chosen to do is well within the range of traditional democratic action, and its hand should not be stayed through the invention of a brand-new \"constitutional right\" by a Court that is impatient of democratic change. It is indeed true that \"later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress,\" ante, at 18; and when that happens, later generations can repeal those laws. But it is the premise of our system that those judgments are to be made by the people, and not imposed by a governing caste that knows best.\n\n \n Scalia recognizes that this is a law which later generations will see as serving no purpose but to oppress. Yet what does he do about it? He does nothing. In fact, he claims that the government should be allowed to create such laws if the majority wills it. Such a claim is perposterous. Our government is designed not so that the majority rules; if we did that, the majority would have free reign to oppress the minority in every case. Our system is designed to balance the power of the government against the power of the people.\n \n The judicial system is the last resort for minorities to obtain protection from the will of the majority. It is Scalia's job to assure that the majority is not oppressing minorities. Yet here he openly admits that this is exactly what is happening, and instead of doing something about it, he claims that the majority should be allowed to do this. He is effectively saying that minorities of today must be allowed to suffer; he is content with allowing later generations to fix the problem. But how many will have suffered by then? \n \n I am ashamed to read the paragraph quoted above and know that its author holds the highest court seat in the land, that he has been charged with protecting the rights of the people. He has here made it clear that he intends on doing no such thing.\n \n One thing Scalia does say that is enlightened is:\n \nthe Court says that the present case \"does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.\" Ante, at 17. Do not believe it.\n\n \n This is true. The court's ruling that day does have a lot to do with whether same-sex marriage should be legalized, and it most likely should be legalized for the exact same reasons.\n \n And that is what Scalia fears. Scalia is so intent on preventing same-sex marriage from becoming a Constitutional right that he has ruled against what he understands to be nothing but oppression, he has ruled against the rights of a minority, and he has ruled against the Constitution. It is not Scalia's will to protect the rights guaranteed in the Constitution that drives him. He is afraid of his growing understanding that if the Constitution prevents states from banning sodomy, then it also prevents states from banning same-sex marriage. And the Constitution does prevent states from banning sodomy.",

   "If everyone read the Constitution as it is written, then there would have been no need for the 19th Amendment.\n \n \n Sorry, but that's just silly. Essentially you are saying that a whole amendment got passed because people didn't read the constitution right. We aren't talking about just anyone of course, but legal and constitutional scholars all across America, who are much more knowledeable about these matters than you are. No, the problem is that you are readng the 14th as an Amendment-to-end-all-amendments when it comes to rights. And it was never intended that way. Your position on the 14th, though shared by others in your movement, is a relatively recent interpretation.\n \n \nBut there are activist judges, and there are people who wish to guess at the intent of the authors, and there are people who wish to mold the Constitution to fit their own opinion.\n\n \n That's exactly what you are doing.\n \n \nBut this goes back to the problem that Hamilton (in the Federalist Papers) spoke of in the quote I wrote earlier. An amendment to protect a right seems like a good idea to those passing the Amendment at the time, that they should specifically guarantee the rights of women to vote, for example. But they fail to consider that as soon as they create this, people will assume that this right couldn't possibly have been protected previously in the Constitution. \n\n \n If it had been previously protected, then the Amendment wouldn't have been necessary. \n \n \nIt doesn't because no one questions it, not today. But both the Constitution and the writings of the authors of the Constitution make it completely clear that the government has no powers outside of those listed, and any attempt to act outside those powers should be deemed unconstitutional by the courts. A lot of what our federal government does today is unconstitutional.\n\n \n Well that's a libertarian position. I agree with you to some extent, but if you are going to take that position, you should be arguing for the eradication of marriage rights altogether rather than \"fairly\" applying the benefits that are given (which is your most oft-used arguement here. I dont' agree with it's premise to begin with as the issue is really the redefinition of marriage.)\n \n \nIt is the argument I spoke of above against the Bill of Rights. The Federalists (supporters of the Constitution) did not want to add a Bill of Rights because it would change people's view of the Constitution. Instead of thinking \"the Constitution lists what the government can do, and it can do nothing else\", people would start thinking \"here's what the government can't do, and it can do everything else.\" The Federalists were right that this would happen, as your current misunderstanding of the government's authority proves.\n\n \n But \"what the govt. can't do and it can do everything else\" is YOUR view. You're the one arguing that the govt can give marriage benefits to anyone and everyone, no matter what sort of arrangement it is. Yes, your specific topic is gay unions, but your logic extends to anything.\n \n \nFirst, anarchy is the lack of government. If I supported the idea that marriage should be \"anything that comes along\", this would have nothing to do with anarchy. It would mean that I have lessened the restrictions on marriage to the point that it can be applied to any group of people. But that has absolutely nothing to do with the lack of a government or the lack of laws. \n\n \n Ok, then I'll not use the term anarchy. I'll use the term \"confusion,\" or \"pandemonium.\" Because that's what it would be.\n \n \nSecond, I do not support defining marriage as \"anything that comes along\", I support defining it in a fashion that treats both homosexuals and heterosexuals equally under the law.\n \n \n No, your logic can't stop there. If you are truly for equality in the sense that you say by claiming it's an issue of fairness, then you have to include ANY arrangement not matter how \"out-there\" it is. Consenting adults and no harm, so nothing else matters, right? :) If you draw a line, which is now what you are doing, it's no longer fair.\n \n \nThis doesn't mean that I support animal/human relationships or anything else so absurd. It means I support equal treatment of homosexuals and heterosexuals.\n\n \n I didn't say anything about animal/human relationships, although your logic would extend to them.\n \n \nPerhaps the problem is still rooted in some prejudice you hold against homosexuals.\n\n \n Perhaps not. Perhaps it is in my view of marriage, which has nothing to do with gay people, but what I believe marriage is.\n \n \nSo if you again repeat the idea that I am not denied the right to marriage, then be honest about it. Follow it up with the fact that although I have the right to marry, you have defined it in such a fashion which assures that I will never use it, allowing you to cleverly prevent me from marrying while still being able to claim I have that right on a technicality.\n\n \n Well, the thing is (and it's a very important point), no one defined it that way. No one said \"hey, let's make sure we define marriage so that nothing other than a man and a woman is included. No, the fact is that marriage came about that way by default, because people simply understood (and still do) that marriage by it's nature is an opposite-sex matter. They didn't need to spell it out. They knew it just as well as they knew the grass was green and the sky was blue. There's a lot to be said for the way culture views it's institutions, and to think of marriage as something that's not opposite-gender is a very new idea. And since redefining marriage is really the issue here, I oppose you doing it. I don't oppose you getting benefits you need any more than I oppose married people getting them, but you aren't getting married, you are joining in gay unions. That's not marriage.\n \n \nThen point out that the only thing I want to change in \"the definition of marriage\" is the part which prevents me from using it, which has no effect on you or anyone else already in a marriage.\n\n \n It DOES effect all of us, because it effects culture and society. It takes a sacred institution and makes it vague, broadening it to mean less. Sort of like if I started a successful movement to redefine \"gay pride\" to include all people and whatever sort pride they had, even if it was not a gay issue. Suddenly it wouldn't mean what you think of it to mean anymore, because it would be too broad. Same idea.\n \n \nWhen you have mentioned those things, then you have presented the whole picture. But so long as you continue to say \"you already have the right to marry\" without recognizing the fact that your restrictions on that right prevent me from ever using it, you are presenting only a partial truth.\n\n \n That's the intent. I don't want you to use an opposite-sex institution.",

Your position on the 14th, though shared by others in your movement, is a relatively recent interpretation.\n\n \n And how am I using the 14th Amendment as an end-all? Which other amendment have I claimed that it superceeds? I have claimed that it accomplishes the same thing as the 19th Amendment and more, but not that it superceeds it.\n \n That being said, the Constitution is read incorrectly all the time. Perhaps you would consider it an incorrect reading of the Constitution to say that the right to have an abortion is protected. But it is not so much as an incorrect reading as it is judicial activism. People, constitutional scholars included, sometimes look to the intentions of an amendment instead of its exact wording. That's activism. And according to some activist viewpoints, the fourteenth amendment had nothing to do with voting.\n \n Now some activists might also believe that the amendment was intended to include rights such as voting. But I am not arguing the activist opinion; I am saying that from a strict constitutionalist viewpoing, reading the Constitution exactly the way it is stated, there is no doubt that the fourteenth amendment protects the right of women to vote.\n \n But in the day that the nineteenth amendment was passed, there were enough people holding the activist opinion that the fourteenth amendment had nothing to do with women's voting rights that they implemented a new amendment to spell out women's rights directly. Activism is not the same thing as misreading the Constitution.\n \n Furthermore, what makes you think those Constitutional scholars are better able to read the Constitution than I am? You may be well aware that they are as varied in opinion as anyone else, which means that some of them must be wrong, and it means that some of them agree with me. Also, you do not know their reasoning. But you do know mine.\n \n \nThat's exactly what you are doing.\n\n \n Then back this claim up. Instead of pointing to a different amendment as evidence that I am wrong, point to the fourteenth. Tell me how creating marriage in a fashion which is designed to be used by heterosexuals but not homosexuals qualifies as equal protection of the laws.\n \n \nIf it had been previously protected, then the Amendment wouldn't have been necessary.\n\n \n This isn't true because the Constitution isn't always considered exactly as it is written. If everyone read exactly what was written in the Constitution, then the 14th Amendment would not have been necessary. But at the time believed that the 14th Amendment was never intended to apply to women's voting rights, even though the exact wording shows that it applies to every law.\n \n \nWell that's a libertarian position. I agree with you to some extent, but if you are going to take that position, you should be arguing for the eradication of marriage rights altogether rather than \"fairly\" applying the benefits that are given (which is your most oft-used arguement here. I dont' agree with it's premise to begin with as the issue is really the redefinition of marriage.)\n\n \n Although the Federal government has no authority to recognize marriage, it is unclear whether state governments do. That being said, we're talking about what is Constitutional here, not what is best. If we are speaking about what is best, I can understand some good reasons for having a government-recognized marriage, just as I can understand some good reasons for the government not recognizing it. I do not intend to argue that point; all I argue for equality between homosexuals and heterosexuals in whatever fashion we create it. Heterosexuals currently have the right to marry, and instead of taking away that right, I argue that if we are going to put it in our laws, everyone should have the right to marry. But equality could be obtained in other ways, and I would not oppose those ways either. If we do not want to allow everyone to marry equally, then we must take it out of our laws.\n \n \nBut \"what the govt. can't do and it can do everything else\" is YOUR view. You're the one arguing that the govt can give marriage benefits to anyone and everyone, no matter what sort of arrangement it is. Yes, your specific topic is gay unions, but your logic extends to anything.\n\n \n No it doesn't. I argue that there are no harms created by same-sex marriage, that every change it creates will be positive. If some other form of relationship can be shown to have even the slightest negative effect, then my logic does not apply.\n \n \nOk, then I'll not use the term anarchy. I'll use the term \"confusion,\" or \"pandemonium.\" Because that's what it would be.\n\n \n And who would be confused? We would all know what legal marriage is. And we would each have our own opinions about what relgious marriage is. That is the same way things are today. Where would there be pandemonium? Would people be running through the streets screaming? Would people go crazy, dress as clowns, and show up at the local Walmart with a tommy gun blazing? Or would people just go about their normal lives, the only people noticing any difference being those who are now allowed to marry? Where is the pandemonium in Massachusettes? Where is it in Canada? Where is it in Spain? If those places are examples of confusion and pandemonium, then sign me up.\n \n \nNo, your logic can't stop there. If you are truly for equality in the sense that you say by claiming it's an issue of fairness, then you have to include ANY arrangement not matter how \"out-there\" it is. Consenting adults and no harm, so nothing else matters, right? :) If you draw a line, which is now what you are doing, it's no longer fair.\n\n \n Since you appear to have no argument against these things, then I'm all for them. The Constitution would support you. But if you can think of a rational harm created by any of those forms of marriage, then I would take up an activist position about the Constitution, and I would not support you.\n \n \nI didn't say anything about animal/human relationships, although your logic would extend to them.\n\n \n Knowing what I wrote above, do you still make this statement? If so, explain it. Do you claim that no harm comes from recognizing animal/human relationships as marriage?\n \n \nPerhaps not. Perhaps it is in my view of marriage, which has nothing to do with gay people, but what I believe marriage is.\n\n \n Then I understand that. But understand that when creating a law, you must let go of your own opinion of what marriage is, and you must make certain that law is equal to everyone. If you support a law which benefits only heterosexuals, then how is that better than the KKK member who supports a law which benefits only white people? It is the KKK member's religion, his belief about what that right is that guides him. Maybe you're right and he's wrong. But our law cannot choose one person's beliefs over another.\n \n \nWell, the thing is (and it's a very important point), no one defined it that way. No one said \"hey, let's make sure we make sure we define marriage so that nothing other than a man and a woman is included. No, the fact is that marriage came about that way by default, because people simply understood (and still do) that marriage by it's nature is an opposite-sex matter. They didn't need to spell it out. They knew it just as well as they knew the grass was green and the sky was blue. There's a lot to be said for the way culture views it's institutions, and to think of marriage as something that's not opposite-gender is a very new idea. And since redefining marriage is really the issue here, I oppose you doing it. I don't oppose you getting benefits you need any more than I oppose married people getting them, but you aren't getting married, you are joining in gay unions. That's not marriage.\n\n \n It's marriage in my opinion. It's only not marriage in yours. But a law cannot take into account individual opinions. When we create a law, we have the responsibility to make sure that law is fair and that it applies to everyone equally. If we name a law marriage, then that law must apply to everyone fairly and equally. Now out of respect for what you believe the word \"marriage\" means, I have offered to use a different word. Any word. It could be multiple words, even. You choose it. But the word must be the same for everyone.\n \n But if I ask, \"how do you justify denying homosexuals access to this legal institution?\", and you respond with \"my beliefs say the word we used to name that institution doesn't apply to homosexuals,\" am I just supposed to accept that as some valid reason to discriminate? It simply isn't a good reason. Why should I even care what your opinion of the definition of a word is? That has nothing to do with the wellbeing of the people. But I do care, and as I said, I'm willing to change that word to something more appropriate. But I'm not willing to give heterosexuals some special legal term for their relationships. Doing so will always imply that heterosexual relationships are superior.\n \n \nIt DOES effect all of us, because it effects culture and society. It takes a sacred institution and makes it vague, broadening it to mean less. Sort of like if I started a successful movement to redefine \"gay pride\" to include all people and whatever sort pride they had, even if it was not a gay issue. Suddenly it wouldn't mean what you think of it to mean anymore, because it would be too broad. Same idea.\n\n \n You're right, it wouldn't mean what I think it means anymore. But how would that harm me? How would that harm society? It wouldn't. If I wanted to talk about gay rights movements, I'd use a more specific term. How about \"gay rights movements\"? I'm fine with that. So if you want to describe opposite-sex marriage, then use the term \"opposite-sex marriage\". Heck, if someone said \"marriage\" to me today, it wouldn't even occur to me that this person might be talking about opposite-sex marriage exclusively.\n \n Or here's another idea: if you don't want the word \"marriage\" to change its meaning, then choose a different one for our laws! What problem is there with choosing a different word for our laws? I have repeated this possibility numerous times.\n \n \nThat's the intent. I don't want you to use an opposite-sex institution.\n\n \n Our laws shouldn't be recognizing an opposite-sex institution. Our laws shouldn't give anything to heterosexuals that it does not give to homosexuals. Why do opposite-sex couples deserve some special legal recognition not given to same-sex couples?\n \n I think you're speaking as though opposite-sex relationships create some tangible institution by their nature. But in reality, institutions are created by some authority's recognition. Your religion chooses to recognize opposite-sex relationships, and not same-sex ones. Our government can choose either to create one institution for heterosexuals and a seperate institution for homosexuals, or it can choose to recognize both of them in the same institution. The first one is not fair. There is not now, and there will never be, anything but harm that comes from segregating heterosexual and homosexual rights, from legally seperating people based on their sexual orientation.",

   "Scalia is right that nudity targets the conduct of a nudist and laws against it are directed toward nudists as a class. Scalia is also right that some sort of rational justification for violating the equal protection clause may warrant its violation (though that is an activist thing to say).\n \n But this is his rational basis? That we should deny equal protection of the laws because of tradition? If such a tradition is enough to deny equal protection of the laws, then the fourteenth amendment granted no protection to African Americans at any time, for they faced a tradition of persecution, segregation and hatred. It is nothing less than disgusting to suggest that a tradition born of intolerance and persecuation of people different than ourselves should be considered rational justification to continue that intolerance and persecution.\n \n \n First off, I haven't read your whole post yet...needless to say I've been rather busy. However, the rational basis test is something the court uses for the 14th amendment. \"Scrict scrutiny\" is used when the issue involves race because of the belief this amendment was intended for that, but rational basis for other things such as denying 10yr olds to marry because this should be rationaly allowed to be regulated. These two tests had been used for a long time and he was saying the court does not use them here and is inconsisent about using tests set up by the court.\n \n \n\n So instead of using the Constitution as his jusitification, he uses a bunch of existing laws, none of which may necessarily hold any Constitutional backing at all.\n No, he using court cases that show how this is constitutional and laws since that was a judge is supposed to do.\n \n \nour constitution could be no more clear that every person has the right to equal protection of the laws. Our laws cannot discriminate. And I think Scalia recognizes this distinction. He is grasping for justification where none exists, and I think he knows it. Or in a more gentle fashion: this is intended to appear to the reader as hard evidence supporting Scalia's point, but I think Scalia recognizes that this is loosely related information, none of which proves his point in any fashion.\n I disagree. His point here would be that congress, the elected body, has spoken about how our country can deny some \"equal protection of law\". His whole case in section V is that it is impossible to have pure equal protection of the laws and that tradition, elected officials, and precedent has shown that this amendment allows for this. Earlier he points how this case would be inconsisent with the ruling in Casey and other cases.\n \n \nScalia recognizes that this is a law which later generations will see as serving no purpose but to oppress. Yet what does he do about it? He does nothing. In fact, he claims that the government should be allowed to create such laws if the majority wills it. Such a claim is perposterous. Our government is designed not so that the majority rules; if we did that, the majority would have free reign to oppress the minority in every case. Our system is designed to balance the power of the government against the power of the people.\n On the contrary, this is where Scalia is 100% correct. The court (who are just 9 people) aren't the moral standard of America and are not allowed to do so. Scalia only recognizes that laws can be changed if found to be bad ones but it is not the courts job to determine what laws are \"good\" and what laws are \"bad\". As you said, the courts are the weakest branch, they aren't supposed to decide moral issues and they aren't supposed to decide if laws are nice or not. If the federalist papers that you talked about support this.\n \n \n Scalias main points in this case are(section V mainly):\n 1) The court is inconsistent in cases to try and achieve a moral code they set\n 2) The 14th amendment is wrongly used because of strict strunity and rational basis tests.\n 3) The 14th amendment can be limited and has been shown to be able to by previous court decisions, tradition, and acts of congress\n 4) The court is not here to decide which laws are good or bad\n \n \n These are all true and while you may not agree with them I believe Scalia is right in how he decided this case...with which 2 others joined I believe.",

   "First off, I haven't read your whole post yet...needless to say I've been rather busy. However, the rational basis test is something the court uses for the 14th amendment. \"Scrict scrutiny\" is used when the issue involves race because of the belief this amendment was intended for that, but rational basis for other things such as denying 10yr olds to marry because this should be rationaly allowed to be regulated. These two tests had been used for a long time and he was saying the court does not use them here and is inconsisent about using tests set up by the court.\n\n \n I consider \"strict scrutiny\" and \"a rational basis\" to be the same thing. The judges must use strict scrutiny to find a rational basis for violating the equal protection of the law. But the point is that they need a rational basis. And my point was that Scalia's rational basis is the least rational basis I can fathom.\n \n His sole rational basis is tradition. But tradition means nothing. It is completely irrational to continue a practice that harms people, simply because that practice has become tradition. In my opinion, there is no rational justification for denying people the right to engage in sodomy (just as there is no justification for denying same-sex marriage yet allowing heterosexual marriage). Scalia's opinion of what qualifies a rational basis should show just how little rationality there is behind denying the right to sodomy.\n \n And even in providing his \"rational\" basis, Scalia must have known that this basis, tradition, was not even the reason that Texas made sodomy illegal. Hhe quotes the real reason when he quotes O'Conner: the desire to harm a politically unpopular group.\n \n \nNo, he using court cases that show how this is constitutional and laws since that was a judge is supposed to do.\n\n \n But that's not what he's showing. That's what the idle reader will believe he is showing, and he's counting on that. But the attentive reader understands that he's showing something else. What he is actually showing, and he states this specifically, is that it is legal to discriminate against homosexuals. I agree with that. It is legal, and it should be legal to do so.\n \n But it is legal to discriminate against blacks, too. Just because we allow individual people to discriminate against blacks, doesn't mean that it is Constitutional to create laws which discriminate against them. And in the same fashion, just because it is Constitutional for an individual to discriminate against gay people doesn't mean that it is Constitutional to create laws which discriminate against them.\n \n Scalia knows this distinction. He knows that the average, idle reader isn't going to understand that distinction. So he put in this correlation to our current court laws to make the average reader agree with him. But if you consider this more closely, he hasn't made any comparison of value at all.\n \n \nI disagree. His point here would be that congress, the elected body, has spoken about how our country can deny some \"equal protection of law\". His whole case in section V is that it is impossible to have pure equal protection of the laws and that tradition, elected officials, and precedent has shown that this amendment allows for this. Earlier he points how this case would be inconsisent with the ruling in Casey and other cases.\n\n \n There absolutely can be equal protection of the laws. Not only that, but the Constitution mandates it. However, Scalia understands that there are reasonable laws which should remain Constitutional, yet do not qualify as \"equal protection of the people.\" He is an activist in this sense. He is willing to violate the Constitution, to discriminate against people, if there is a rational basis for doing so.\n \n And I agree. Although a strict constitutionalist viewpoint mandates that we must always have equal protection of the laws, I am an activist on this amendment, just as Scalia is. I believe that if there is some rational basis for denying the equal protection of the laws, it may be acceptable to deny equal protection.\n \n But in this case, there is no rational basis, and we've already seen Scalia's \"rational basis\". It isn't rational at all. He doesn't show how denying sodomy is in the interest of the state, the people, or anyone else. Denying sodomy does nothing but harm those who wish to engage in it. Scalia appears to have just whipped up whatever random fact is convenient, in this case that denying sodomy is tradition (which might not even be true), and claimed that this fact provides some sort of rational basis for denying sodomy. In reality it of course provides no rational basis.\n \n \nOn the contrary, this is where Scalia is 100% correct. The court (who are just 9 people) aren't the moral standard of America and are not allowed to do so. Scalia only recognizes that laws can be changed if found to be bad ones but it is not the courts job to determine what laws are \"good\" and what laws are \"bad\". As you said, the courts are the weakest branch, they aren't supposed to decide moral issues and they aren't supposed to decide if laws are nice or not. If the federalist papers that you talked about support this.\n\n \n The court may not be the moral standard of America, but suggesting otherwise? I'm not. But I will say that the courts are definitely supposed to get rid of laws that aren't nice. There can be no doubt about it, if you consider anti-sodomy laws \"not nice\". If we look at a law which denies individual freedom, discriminates against a minority, is prohibited in the Constitution, and has no rational basis backing its existence, and say that the court shouldn't be allowed to overturn it, then exactly what laws do you propose the court should be allowed to overturn?\n \n I propose that the anti-sodomy law is exactly what the courts should be overturning. Did the authors of the Constitution not suggest that the courts would act as way for minorities to protect their rights from majority discrimination? Isn't this exactly a case of that?\n \n And aren't judges supposed to protect the rights guaranteed in the Constitution? Isn't this exactly a case of the rights listed in the Constitution being denied?\n \n And aren't courts supposed to do what is in the best interest of the people? And is allowing sodomy not in the best interest of the people?\n \n So if you are looking at the founder's intentions, allowing sodomy is the court's duty. If you're looking at the powers and responsibilities listed in the Constitution, then allowing sodomy is the court's duty. And if you're looking at what is in the actual best interest of the people and the nation, then allowing sodomy is the court's duty.\n \n Where does the courts deciding morality even come into play?\n \n \nScalias main points in this case are(section V mainly):\n 1) The court is inconsistent in cases to try and achieve a moral code they set\n\n \n Though that may be a problem, that problem resides in the individual members of the courts. Judges shouldn't be overturning this law because they want to achieve some moral code, they should be overturning it because its unconstituional, overturning it is in the best interest of the people, and there is no rational justification for its existence.\n \n \n2) The 14th amendment is wrongly used because of strict strunity and rational basis tests.\n\n \n This is an activist opinion, and it is one I agree with. But it was not wrongly used here; Scalia's proposed rational basis was nothing less than completely irrational (as described above and in my previous post).\n \n \n3) The 14th amendment can be limited and has been shown to be able to by previous court decisions, tradition, and acts of congress\n\n \n Again this point is one I agree with, but it says nothing about whether the anti-sodomy laws should be made an exception. Also, I personally find it absurd for any judge to base his opinion, not on the Constitution itself, but on some other judge's opinion. Will Scalia uphold Roe v Wade simply because judges have upheld it in the past? I suspect if he is faced with such a case, he will actually turn to the Constitution instead of \"decisions, tradition, and acts of Congress\". And the Constitution is where he should be turning.\n \n \n4) The court is not here to decide which laws are good or bad\n\n \n He did not make that point, and if he did, he would be incredibly wrong. It is absolutely the court's job to decide which laws are good or bad. But it does so by judging whether they are Constitutional and whether they are reasonable, not whether they satisfy that individual judge's concept of morality.\n \n In the case of anti-sodomy laws, they are definitely unconstitutional, and Scalia understand that a law can be unconstitutional if he can come up with some good reason for it. But the reason he came up with, upholding tradition, is not a good reason at all. It's a random fact, that we've traditionally banned sodomy; it has nothing to do with the wellbeing of the people or a rational decision-making process.\n \n \nThese are all true and while you may not agree with them I believe Scalia is right in how he decided this case...with which 2 others joined I believe.\n\n \n Two judges did join with him. And six opposed. But it would not matter if all nine supported him. He is wrong.\n \n In my opinion, Scalia's decision on this case and his justification for that decision represent one of the worst misuses of the position of Supreme Court jusitce that I am aware of.\n \n I believe he does the following:\n \n He correctly points out that laws should be allowed to violate the fourteenth amendment if enough rational basis for doing so can be provided for doing so, but the basis he describes, tradition, is completely irrational.\n \n He basically tricks readers into confusing the difference between allowing individuals to discriminate against homosexuals and allowing our laws to do so. Those two things are completely different, and one is Constitutional while the other most certainly is not.\n \n He admits that the anti-sodomy laws are a form of oppression, and he understands that by reading the exact word of the Constitution, he must end that oppression, but he instead states that it is not his place to end oppression and suggests that those being oppressed should be forced to continue to suffer until some future legislature realizes the harm they've caused.\n \n And finally, Scalia speaks out against judges letting their own individual morality determine their court rulings, but in my opinion, he has allowed his own moral opposition to homosexuality to determine his decision on this case.\n \n I do not mean to imply that Scalia has anything less than the best of intentions. But an individual's just intentions do not always lead him to make actually just decisions. And Scalia's ruling on this case is wrong in every possible way that a judge's ruling could be wrong.",

It is as I've always said: denying same-sex marriage puts heterosexuals on a pedastal. It elevates them over homosexuals. It makes them better than gay people under our law. If we allow gay people to marry, then everyone will be equal. Of course you don't want that. It is natural for people not to want to give up their pedastal, their legal recognition of being better than someone else.\n \n But it's wrong and it's selfish. You deserve no pedastal, and you are not better than a gay person. If you do not understand this, then giving gay people the same legal rights that you have will never make sense, for why should someone who is better not be recognized as better under the law? Legal marriage shouldn't be some condensed, special pedastal for straight people. So yeah, I'm watering it down. It's time to give up your superiority and admit that we are all equal.\n \n You say that leaving marriage as it stands is fair, and changing it is unfair. But we both know that leaving marriage as it stands means only some people get it. And we both know that when only some people are allowed something that everyone deserves, then that is what isn't fair. If you want to be fair, instead of saying that there are special legal rights which are yours, give those legal rights to everyone. Nothing is fair about keeping marriage from gay people.",

So far as I can tell, Scalia, never actually said what his rational basis test would conclude or how he would get there but rather that all the state needs is a \"legimate purpose\"\n\n \n Scalia states that in order to justify denying equal protection under the law, we must have a rational basis for that justification. He claims that this rational basis is the enforcement of tradition. Here is a quote from him:\n \n \"Of course the same could be said of any law. A law against public nudity targets 'the conduct that is closely correlated with being a nudist,' and hence 'is targeted at more than conduct'; it is 'directed toward nudists as a class.' But be that as it may. Even if the Texas law does deny equal protection to 'homosexuals as a class,' that denial still does not need to be justified by anything more than a rational basis, which our cases show is satisfied by the enforcement of traditional notions of sexual morality.\"\n \n So according to Scalia, the fact that people of past generations considered homosexuality wrong is enough reason to continue targetting homosexuals as a class today, denying their rights. I suggest that not only is this reasoning wrong, it is evil. I will go into that below, where you claim that our courts should use tradition.\n \n \nand if restricting marriage is a legimate purpose then how is restricting homosexual sodemy not?\n\n \n You mean to say that if there is no rational basis for denying sodomy, then how is there rational basis for denying marriage, right? Well when Scalia poses this question, he brings up a good point. There is no rational basis for denying either.\n \n \nI would say he attacking O'Connors rationalization of the rational-basis test rather then stating his own. In the paragraphs above Secion V you must remember that the arguement is about the Due Process clause and not the Equal Protection clause.\n\n \n He is attacking O'Conner's rationalization, that is for certain, but I am not arguing against his criticism of O'Conner, for she is only mostly correct. He also provides rationalization for his own decision, and the reasons he provides for his own decision are wrong.\n \n \nOne other point. Tradition should always be used by the courts. This is how they find the meanings of many things and as stated in Scalia's dissents and otehr judges, it is a big part of what our country is.\n\n \n First, I will point out that \"finding the meaning of things\" is activism. Though I do feel that both activism and strict constitutionalism have their places in our courts.\n \n However, looking to tradition is a very bad way of determining the intentions of an amendment. Those writing a particular amendment are not likely factoring in tradition in any fashion during their writing of it, and looking at tradition should therefore reveal nothing about their intentions.\n \n What we should do is interpret the reasons an amendment is written as it is. Consider the fourteenth amendment, for example, the equal protection clause specifically. It was certainly included to prevent any state from denying equal protection of the laws to blacks. Yet we can see that it does not specifically mention blacks. The fact that it does not mention blacks indicates that it was intended to any groups who might be discriminated against.\n \n Now if there were some other group that they had in mind, laws discriminating against that group would have been removed immediately along with laws discriminating against blacks. But it was certainly only laws discriminating against blacks that were removed. It logically follows then that this clause was intented to protect groups discriminated against in the future, groups who the authors were not yet able to name specifically but who might appear in the future.\n \n Understanding this, it does not make sense to suggest that this amendment couldn't apply to homosexuality because of a tradition opposing homosexuality. There is no indication that this amendment was meant to be bound by tradition. It was meant instead to apply to all people, all groups, even those which tradition has discriminated against.\n \n But consider what the fourteenth amendment would say if it did factor in tradition. If we can consider the enforcement of traditional notions of sexual morality a rational basis, why would we be unable to consider the enforcement of traditional notions of racial superiority to be one? As I stated, this amendment was not intended to be bound by tradition. It was intended to remove the discrimination that we have traditionally caused.\n \n And what good reason is there to look to tradition in the first place? It is understandable, in my opinion, to consider freedom, equality, happiness, and that which is in the best interest of the people when interpreting the Constitution. We might even consider the writings of those who created an amendment in order to determine its meaning.\n \n But why tradition? If we can show that a tradition has caused undue discrimination and oppression, has targetted a minority unjustly, should we really continue that simply because we've always done it in the past? Does that really make any sense at all? I submit that it makes none, and that any judge who rules to harm a minority based not on the Constitution, not on the principles behind the Constitution, and not on the best interest of the people is a judge who has failed in both his legal and moral duties.\n \n It is a judge's duty to protect the rights guaranteed in the Constitution, and to make this nation a better place for everyone. So when a judge rules to continue to oppress, to continue to harm, simply because we've always done so in the past, that judge is wrong.",

Scalia suggests they are one in the same (reasoning that is..not same in what they are) and thus her arguements are not consistent. Thats the only point there, and I think you agree he is correct.\n \n \nFirst, I will point out that \"finding the meaning of things\" is activism. Though I do feel that both activism and strict constitutionalism have their places in our courts.\n I gotta ask, why are you harping on this activism thing? You have said it in the last 5 posts and I am not sure where I argued otherwise. Scalia admits he is an \"activist judge\" using his own definition of course. He is far from a \"strict constructionist\" like some believe he is...and he says this. He states that first he is a texualist then a orginalist.\n \n I will post on the rest tomorrow or something...so try not to respond to this right yet.",
