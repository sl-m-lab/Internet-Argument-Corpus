   "\n 2 Timothy 3:16,17 \n \n Quote:\n All scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. \n \n Where does your definition of Christian get its information about Christianity? Without the Bible, what is your source?\n\n \n Where did Paul get his information? He didn't know the living Jesus and he didn't have any New Testament.\n \n Now, what was Paul talking about? What was \"scripture\" in Paul's day? The gospels hadn't been written yet and no one, least of all Paul, thought that his letters would be considered scripture. \n \n The only \"scripture\" was the first 5 books of the Bible -- the Torah. And guess what, they don't mention Jesus at all. What's more, Paul has been telling the converts that the major portion of those books -- the Law -- doesn't apply anymore. So, why should they read scripture? This is Paul's answer. Even tho the Torah doesn't mention Jesus, even tho most if it is to be disregarded, it is still \"useful for training ... and instruction in righteosness\".\n \n Notice that Paul does not say it is required. Only that it is useful.\n \n When you say you don't have any other source for knowledge of Christianity, you are denying the central tenet of Christianity: Jesus LIVES\n \n Where do you get knowledge? The same place Paul did: a personal relationship with the living Jesus.\n \n Too bad you don't have such a relationship. If you did, you would never have asked that question. So you cling to a literal \"inerrant Bible as a drowning man clings to a life preserver. I'm sorry. Hopefully someday you will have a relationship with God and won't feel so lonely.",

God speaks to no one today, despite what a few televangelists have tried to tell us. \n\n \n How sad for you. Apparently you don't have a personal relationship with God. Please don't project your weakness on everyone else. Marc, millions of people alive today -- none of them televangelists -- say that God speaks to them.\n \n \nThe fact is, there is very widespread acceptance of it from Christianity, and I know of no other formal, organized denomination of Christianity that does not. If theistic evolutionists do not accept it, I'm trying to find out what their methods are for finding and knowing God, and for understanding Jesus' work of redemption - two things basic to theism. \n\n \n The Bible is accepted; a literal interpreation of it is not. The Bible is one way to know about God. Another is His Creation. And yes, Christianity has always had a \"two-books\" tradition. The third, of course, if thru the Holy Ghost. But, of course, you don't have communication that way. I'm sorry for you, but you can't make up for that by clinging blindly to the Bible.\n \n \n \nIf it was a requirement, then works would be involved in redemption. The Bible clearly indicates that good works are not part of the equation. I believe there are many heaven bound people who have never picked up a Bible in their lives. \n\n \n Then where did they get the knowledge of God to be \"heaven bound\"?\n \n \nWhere does he live? I agree that he lives, but he doesn't speak directly to anyone today. \n\n \n Where does God live? God is spirit. No material body to have a \"home\". Same with Jesus, isn't it? Sorry, but as I said, millions of people disagree. It's apparent, however, that Jesus doesn't speak to you. Can't imagine why.\n \n \n Do you go to any church?\n\n \n I'm Methodist.\n \n \nWhy is there no \"theistic evolution\" denomination? \n\n \n Several denominations are theistic evolution: Methodist, Presbyterian USA, Catholic, Episcopalian, African-Methodist, Congregationalist. You can see many of these here:\n http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/4650_statements_from_religious_orga_3_13_2001.asp\n \n Theistic evolution does not have any particular doctrine. It is simply the view that God created using the processes discovered by science.\n \n \nIf another theistic evolutionist (who has a relationship with God like yours) disagrees with you, how do you resolve it? \n\n \n Discussion. If the disagreement involves personal experience and our experience disagrees, then we would agree to disagree.",

   "Significant teachings of Jesus, including references to Genesis, conflict directly with what many \"Christian\" theistic evolutionists claim. Not ludicrous, not moot.\n\n \n Not really. Jesus tells us in Mark 10 and Matthew 14 that the Bible was written by men and they made mistakes. \n \n When Jesus refers to Genesis, he does so like we should refer to any part of the Bible: for the theological message, not a literal history. For instance, in both Mark 10 and Matthew 14 (same story told in each gospel), Jesus refers back to Genesis 1 to counter a Law about divorce. Because God created humans in both men and women, it is not right to allow a man to divorce but not a woman. This works whether God made humans by speaking (as in Genesis 1) or by evolution.",
