   "Come on then! Deliver acme weapons to that crazy Georgia and her weird president Saakashvili obsessed with war games. One must be absolutely nutty to believe that freak's words about \"Russian intrusion\" and all that.... \n Latest models of AT and air defense asserts may be real grenade in vital transit region in the Caucasus. \n I wonder how long is Saakashvili going to fool USA and Europe by \"Russian war threat\" to get lots of money and help just as some bonus to \"little and poor\" Georgia? I suspect Saakashvili and his suite care only about sorting it out with their neighbors and nothing more. That's becoming big irritant indeed!",
