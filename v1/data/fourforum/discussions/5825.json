   "CONSIDER:\n In the 1950's in America, we passed God-inclusive laws such as adding \"Under God\" to the Pledge of Allegiance, \"In God We Trust\" to our money; a National Day of Prayer was observed, and a Prayer Room was built in the U.S. Capitol among many other various religious-based national and state laws. Two thirds of Americans belonged to an organized church. \n\n During WWII, at both home and abroad, Americans were facing hard times, hard decisions, and pressed on all sides. It seemed that everywhere there was chaos: German, Japanese, Italian internment - guilty placed with the innocent. Homemakers, farmers, ranchers, clerks, teachers, etc., were stripped of rights, relocated to some distant \"prison\" and given only the basics to live on. Wives clung to husbands, children to parents, as they were labeled \"dangerous\". In many, many instances all these folks had (and their neighbors that visited them quite frequently, which meant driving for days) were constant prayers. They trusted in God despite all the things that befell them. I need to mention that some of these neighbors were not only US citizens, but also atheists - and they bowed their heads out of respect for their neighbor.\n It was this one \"oneness\", in the name of God that carried many of them through that ordeal and made them realize that God did still work in and through the lives of others that took it over into the next decade.\n Need I say anything about the soldiers that were comforted on the battlefield by a stranger showing the love of God? Those that did make it back home surely brought that home with them and spread it to the 50's.\n \nCONSIDER:\n In the 1960's, violent crime, along with property crime, exploded in an unprecedented manner and scope. Both continued their upward trends for 30 years. \n\n Seeing that people began to call upon the name of God more than ever, and seeing that they began to add God to all things important, Satan began to work in any way he saw fit. Evil began to spread; people began to rebel against God, and began to do \"what was right in their own mind\". Religion became contaminated with Evil, teaching that which was contrary to the Gospel.\n \nCONSIDER:\n In the ensuing decades, the U.S. has \"kicked\" God out of public schools, made the 10 Commandments unwelcome in our courthouses, and we have seen church membership steadily decline.\n\n Needless to say, that is what happens when nothing is held sacred anymore.\n \nCONSIDER:\n Violent crime has been markedly declining since 1993, as has property crime.\n\n People began to see what the \"Me Freedoms\", selfish-mindedness was doing and began to reach back to the fundamentals of God - some of them seeing for the first time the error of their ways.\n \nCONCLUSION:\n The experiment into theocracy has been a dismal failure. We need to take our country back to its secular roots, as our founding fathers envisaged it.\n\n The scriptures where God tells us to \"hold fast\" despite the overwhelming urges to rely on ourselves is still making a huge impact. The impression of God may be now just an echo to some, but for the majority that have understood the meaning of \"Do not grow weary in well-doing\" makes a lot of sense.",

   "Big O, Big O, Big O. I composed the O.P. this morning while sipping on my first cup of coffee, after musing in bed about how often I've been told that since we kicked God out of school, or are removing gaudy monuments from our courthouses that this country is going to hell.
