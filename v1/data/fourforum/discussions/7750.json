   "Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) was a German philosopher and one of the founders of what came to be known as the existentialist movement. He believed, in essence, that mankind should concentrate on the here and now as opposed to the hereafter. I don't buy into everything that he had to say, but I find some of his stuff rather interesting, at least in terms of discussion. \n \n \"Sins\" are indispensable to every society organized on an ecclesiastical basis; they are the only reliable weapons of power; the priest lives upon sins; it is necessary to him that there be \"sinning.\"\n \n \"Faith\" means the will to avoid knowing what is true.\n \n Christianity came into existence in order to lighten the heart; but now it has first to burden the heart so as afterwards to be able to lighten it.\n \n Christianity has done its utmost to close the circle and declared even doubt to be sin. One is supposed to be cast into belief without reason, by a miracle, and from then on to swim in it as in the brightest and least ambiguous of elements: even a glance towards land, even the thought that one perhaps exists for something else as well as swimming, even the slightest impulse of our amphibious nature -- is sin! And notice that all this means that the foundation of belief and all reflection on its origin is likewise excluded as sinful. What is wanted are blindness and intoxication and an eternal song over the waves in which reason has drowned.\n \n The Christian church is an encyclopaedia of prehistoric cults and conceptions of the most diverse origin, and that is why it is so capable of proselytizing: it always could, and it can still go wherever it pleases and it always found, and always finds something similar to itself to which it can adapt itself and gradually impose upon it a Christian meaning.\n \n On Paul...\n \n That the ship of Christianity threw overboard a good deal of its Jewish ballast, that it went, and was able to go, among the pagans--that was due to this one man, a very tortured, very pitiful, very unpleasant man, unpleasant even to himself. He suffered from a fixed idea--or more precisely, from a fixed, ever-present, never-resting question: what about the Jewish law? and particularly the fulfillment of this law? In his youth he had himself wanted to satisfy it, with a ravenous hunger for this highest distinction which the Jews could conceive - this people who were propelled higher than any other people by the imagination of the ethically sublime, and who alone succeeded in creating a holy god together with the idea of sin as a transgression against this holiness. Paul became the fanatical defender of this god and his law and guardian of his honor; at the same time, in the struggle against the transgressors and doubters, lying in wait for them, he became increasingly harsh and evilly disposed towards them, and inclined towards the most extreme punishments. And now he found that--hot-headed, sensual, melancholy, malignant in his hatred as he was-- he was himself unable to fulfill the law; indeed, and this seemed strangest to him, his extravagant lust to domineer provoked him continually to transgress the law, and he had to yield to this thorn.\n \n Is it really his \"carnal nature\" that makes him transgress again and again? And not rather, as he himself suspected later, behind it the law itself, which must constantly prove itself unfulfillable and which lures him to transgression with irresistable charm? But at that time he did not yet have this way out. He had much on his conscience - he hints at hostility, murder, magic, idolatry, lewdness, drunkenness, and pleasure in dissolute carousing - and... moments came when he said to himself:\"It is all in vain; the torture of the unfulfilled law cannot be overcome.\"... The law was the cross to which he felt himself nailed: how he hated it! how he searched for some means to annihilate it--not to fulfill it any more himself!\n \n And finally the saving thought struck him,... \"It is unreasonable to persecute this Jesus! Here after all is the way out; here is the perfect revenge; here and nowhere else I have and hold the annihilator of the law!\"... Until then the ignominious death had seemed to him the chief argument against the Messianic claim of which the new doctrine spoke: but what if it were necessary to get rid of the law?\n \n The tremendous consequences of this idea, of this solution of the riddle, spin before his eyes; at one stroke he becomes the happiest man; the destiny of the Jews--no, of all men--seems to him to be tied to this idea, to this second of its sudden illumination; he has the thought of thoughts, the key of keys, the light of lights; it is around him that all history must revolve henceforth. For he is from now on the teacher of the annihilation of the law...\n \n This is the first Christian, the inventor of Christianity.",

(Perhaps others have read what translates as 'The Gay Science' : an intriguing title). \n \n But I think what Nietzsche has to say about Christianity must be understood as ironic and multi-layered. His criticism of the moral climate of the 19th century seems remote (at least to me) from our modern meditations on the evils of 'consumer societies' etc. \n \n At the basis of his anti-Christian or anti-religious views is the idea that human nature is driven by 'a will to power', and that 'resentment' occurs as a result of this drive being frustrated in action. Among the causes of this frustration or corruption of human nature, are religions, such as Christianity, that feed on resentment. \n \n Some specially gifted human beings rise above this frustration/resentment that religion inculcates or encourages - these are the 'supermen' which continue to provoke so many false notions and clich\u00e9s",

   "I never actually read Nietsche, I never had the time to. Reading serious books requires both more time and uninterrupted attention than the regular reading.\n \n However, even from reading about Nietsche, and from excerpts, I know enough to know just how wrong the superficial reading by Easyrider & co comes out. \"God is dead\", as actually used by Nietsche is far closer to Easyrider's position than he realizes. Hah, just one sentence further, we can see that things are far more complicated. \n \nGod is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we, murderers of all murderers, console ourselves?\n\n \n Since Wiki is handy, this paragraph, with added bolds by me, should illustrate what is the real meaning of the phrase:\n \n \nNietzsche is also well-known for the statement \"God is dead\". While in popular belief it is Nietzsche himself who blatantly made this declaration, it was actually placed into the mouth of a character, a \"madman,\" in The Gay Science. It was also later proclaimed by Nietzsche's Zarathustra. This largely misunderstood statement does not proclaim a physical death, but a natural end to the belief in God being the foundation of the western mind. It is also widely misunderstood as a kind of gloating declaration, when it is actually described as a tragic lament by the character Zarathustra.\n \n \"God is Dead\" is more of an observation than a declaration. Nietzsche did not advance arguments for atheism, but merely observed that, for all practical purposes, his contemporaries lived \"as if\" God were dead. Nietzsche believed this \"death\" would eventually undermine the foundations of morality and lead to moral relativism and moral nihilism. To avoid this, he believed in re-evaluating the foundations of morality and placing them not on a pre-determined, but a natural foundation through comparative analysis.\n\n \n What Nietsche is trying to get across is that our knowledge, our science has gone beyond the dogma of the middle ages and with knowledge driven god from the ultimate omnipresence that is the heart of christian monotheism. The moment when we discovered that lightning is created by air friction, thunder stopped being the angry shout of god. The moment we knew that eclipses happened regularly, predictably and were harmless, we ceased to fear god would take the sun away. Knowing more and more of nature, we find it more and more difficult to believe in god. And thus, god leaves our minds.\n \n And this leaves a vacuum. Nietsche observed and pointed out that god was woven into the very fabric of our society, and that removing him leaves the basic structure of our morality and ethics significantly weakened. Without foundation. To Nietsche, this would necessitate the establishment of a new set of values, ones that would hold without a god to support them.",

She said he was a Nazi, but I've never seen evidence that she totally rewrote his work: if so, then it's meaningless to talk about his thought, as we don't know it, and we should study her instead.\n \n As for 'God is Dead', like all existentialists he wasn't being straightforward. The text of it is at http://www.cs.rice.edu/~ssiyer/minstrels/poems/953.html\n \n It's complex: the people who are told are not the religious (at first), but cynical atheists. We can't see it as clearly good or bad: it's simply too immense for current man to know:\n \n \"How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers?\n What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled\n to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us?\n What water is there for us to clean ourselves?\n What festivals of atonement, what sacred gamesshall we have to invent?\n Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us?\n Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?\n There has never been a greater deed; and whoever is born after us -\n For the sake of this deed he will belong to a higher history than all\n history hitherto.\"\n \n Iuris: you make very good points: particularly the point of the importance of God and the need to rework our world view. Nietzsche did not underestimate the potency of religion, but he thought that when the Jewish God became an abstract good this started a decline ending in Christianity, with a corrupted slave-morality etc. He preferred Islam, which he saw as immediate and glorying in life, saying 'The superiority of Islam to Christianity is as clear as the superiority of an Arab to a Jew' or somesuch.\n \n \nIt probably was a corruption of Neitche by his sister, which was then appropriated by the Nazi's.\nWhy would Nietzsche's sister condemn the superman?

Since we are the creators of our own values, which need not be shared, we are also responsible for living up to them.\n \n A scepticism about truth and fact - which leads to a plurality of interpretations that are completely at odds with the consensus and settled authority of a religious age.\n \n The claim that knowledge and strength are more valuable than compassion and meekness. \n \n Lots more 'modern instances' like these can be inferred from the sayings of Nietzsche/Zarathustra which seem to anticipate the moral ethos of our times\n \n The reason this thread interests me is because the insights of Nietzsche challenge us to deal with the moral consequences of living in a world without God. Which leads me to suggest that Easyrider's reactions to this thinker are too precipitate and defensive. People who do not share his religious convictions may share his moral concerns.\n \n I am, of course, troubled by some of Nietzsche's weird ideas - a few of which seem to teeter on the border of irrationalism. His portentous style of writing can also be a turn off - often hilarious, as OC observes, but unintentionally so. (I might be wrong about his style: I have been told that my copy of Zarathustra is a rotten translation).",

Hastings once forcibly illustrated the unique way in which the Bible has withstood the attacks of skepticism: \n \n \"Infidels of eighteen hundred years have been refuting and overthrowing this book, and yet it stands today as solid rock. Its circulation increases, and it is more loved and cherished and read today than ever before. Infidels, with all their assaults, make about as much impression on this book as a man with a tack hammer would on the Pyramids of Egypt. \n \n \"When the French monarch proposed the persecution of Christians in his dominion, an old statesman and warrior said to him, 'Sire, the church of God is an anvil that has worn out many hammers.' So the hammers of infidels have been pecking away at this book for ages, but the hammers are worn out, and the anvil still endures. If this book had not been the book of God, men would have destroyed it long ago. Emperors and popes, kings and priests, princes and rulers have all tried their hand at it; they die and the book still lives.\"\n \n \"No other book has been so chopped, knived, sifted, scrutinized, and vilified. What book on philosophy or religion or psychology or belles lettres of classical or modern times has been subject to such a mass attack as the Bible? With such venom and skepticism? With such thoroughness and erudition? Upon every chapter, line and tenet? The Bible is still loved by millions, and studied by millions.\n \n http://www.forerunner.com/forerunner/X0002_Anvil.html\n \n Jesus is Lord!!",

You want to talk about alleged Christian inconsisticies, well that one's a real doozer! You have pagan influences that your religion embraces such as reincarnation. You sometimes quote from various rabbis from antiquity, but the vast majority of them are commentators on Orthodox Judaism, which Reform Theology has sought to distance itself from. And there's many in the Orthodox movement who don't even consider yourselves real Jews, since you don't embrace the true Jewish faith. Your movement embraces illicit homosexual unions which the real God considers sin, and which movement seeks to ram its gay agenda down the throats of innocent elementary school children. Moreso, there is no official recognition of an afterlife, or even a Jewish Messiah, in your religion. In Reform Judaism, if there is an afterlife, it's supposedly based on rewarding works - believing in God is not even necessary. This is somewhat humerous since who is it that's supposedly going to reward those works if God doesn't exist? It's also embarrassing for the movement that it can't define what kind of works, or how many works, it takes to gain eternal life, and thus no one can have any peace of mind during this lifetime wondering if they're ever going to make it or not. To make matters worse, as noted in the beliefs section I previously posted, Reform Judaism states that \"Most believe God is forgiving of all.\" Again, one has to wonder then if Reform Jews will feel at ease in eternity with Adolph Hitler and Joseph Stalin and other serial murderers running loose in their midst? Have you no answer for that??? And not the least of your problems is that there's absolutely no objective foundation that any of these beliefs are either credible or ordained by God. And this is the platform you're going to use to step off into eternity? Quite frankly, even the Easter Bunny or Santa Claus fares as well as these stretches of the imagination. I strongly urge you to get into something else, or provide some credible evidence that what you currently have is worthy of embracing.",
