What I find myself wishing was that we supplied security for her as she would still be alive if we had. They learned from their last attempt with a roadside bomb. This time they used one as a diversion, knowing her security would take her out when the car she was in couldn't move. So they had the sniper on a perch waiting to pick her off as she left her car for cover.\n \n Had she had American security, we would have scoured that complete route before ever traveling it with her and would probably even had alternate routes so no one person knew which one would be used until the last minute. I am sure that Bhutto had an islamic spy in her midst that was able to leak the details of her route well in advance of this mornings rally. \n \n Anyway, that is the type of involvement I was referring to. Not the policy making or deciding who their president is kind at all. We have no right to that type of interference into their National affairs.",
