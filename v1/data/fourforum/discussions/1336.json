   "Here is a simple test to see if an animal is self-aware, or aware of self.\n \n Place a mirror in front of the animal and watch its reaction. You will see that many animals will react to it as if another animal is there, or ignore it, and not think that it is themself instead. There are very few animals which will know that the image is in fact a reflection of themself. I.E. Chimps, other primates, and dolphins.\n \n http://www.jhu.edu/%7Enewslett/05-3-01/Science/2.html",

I have a 1-year-old son. at about 7 month old I showed him a mirror and he naturally took interest in the baby he saw in the reflection. that doesnt mean he was aware he was looking at himself, but it showed that he was interested in the face looking back at him\n \n I dont think the test really proved self awareness... but it is very interesting to think about",

   "This strikes me as a nonsense test. Why do you need to be self-aware to understand a mirror any more than you need to be self-aware to clean yourself? You also have to consider that for many animals sight is not the primary sense, could it be that some of these animals do nor recognise themselves in a mirror because the reflection doesn't smell right?\n \n What does 'self-aware' mean anyway? Is it the same concept as consciousness? If not, what is the difference? What is consciousness anyway?",

Ask the child what they think is in the box, most liekly they will reply 'smarties' give them the box which in fact contains pencils. Now ask the child what they think an someone else who has just entered the room what they think is inside- under the age of about 3-4 humans are not properly self aware and the child will answer 'pencils' being unable to distinguish between what it knows and what someone else might know.\n \n Conciousness is being able to process outside information and make evaluations based on predictions (if a animal has experienced being burnt it will not touch things it recognises as doing it), self awareness is an ablity to form a concept of self, it makes no disticntion between itself and the rest of the world's mind. Or something like that in more techniqual words.",

When they see it in the mirror again their hands go straight to the dot. They also behave in a very different way towards than to anything else. They open their mouths wide and have a good look inside and it seems fairly clear they are examining parts of their body they cannot see. Rhesus monkeys don't react this way.",
