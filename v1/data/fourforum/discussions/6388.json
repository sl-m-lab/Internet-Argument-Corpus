   "1. A little provision for our friends in combat armor was buried deep in the Act. The government now has a fully legal right to cut off all funding to schools that refuse to disclose personal student information, telephone numbers, full names, ages, addresses, etc to U.S. Armed Forces recruiters... something that leaves no child behind the warzone.\n \n 2. Portrayed as a sensitive, almost progressive effort to lift disadvantaged students out of their poorly performing schools and deliver them their slice of the American Dream, the reality of NCLB is a pale and bleak one. It's all packaging, with little actual content.\n \n 3. An earlier President Bush set extravagant goals for the year 2000, most of which were never attained. Our memories are short, evidently . . .\n \n By the Year 2000, all children in America will start school ready to learn...\n \n All children will have access to high-quality and\n developmentally appropriate preschool programs\n that prepare children for school;\n Every parent in the United States will be a child's\n first teacher and devote time each day to helping\n such parent's preschool child learn, and parents will\n have access to the training and support parents\n need; and\n Children will receive the nutrition, physical activity\n experiences, and health care needed to arrive at\n school with healthy minds and bodies, and to\n maintain the mental alertness necessary to be\n prepared to learn.\n \n In the state of Georgia alone, The Georgia Head Start Association, Inc. claims \"121, 000 Head Start eligible children age 0-5 were not served, due to lack of funding.\"\n \n 4. Separation of Church/State is shot. In June of 2002, the Supreme Court approved faith-based charter schools in Cleveland, Ohio, opening the door to the public, state funding of religious schooling. Central to the decision was the argument that parental choice somehow negated the issue of church/state separation.\n \n Feel free to add your own rage against the NCLBA, one of the sickest, most twisted creations of an already twisted president's mind.",

Reasons need to be investigated and problems addressed. For example my son's school frequently scores lower than others in our area.

There are many gang problems and gang fights with weapons aren't that uncommon at our school. We also have an irregularly large ESOL (english for speakers of other languages) program. Under the NCLB act, these kids have to pass the english tests at the same rate as the kids speaking English as a first language. That's not fair.\n \n I've found that most of the time with \"failing schools\" it seems like it's the kids. We were in danger of failing the NCLB tests so the school offered rewards for taking the tests: Food at breaks, raffle tickets to win gift certificates and an IPOD, and tickets to homecoming. This year we passed both our math and English tests, the 2 we had failed last year, along with the other 2 (biology and government). We also spend much more time practicing for the tests.\n \n Now any test where practicing can get you better is not a good measure of your ability and especially not of the schools' teaching ability.\n \n I think the better approach is to leave it up to the parents and kids. They know when a teacher isn't teaching them anything, I've had a couple of those myself. If there was some process for complaining about this or at least getting an investigation, maybe we would get better teachers. The problem is that teachers don't get paid much, so not many people want to be a teacher, thus they can't exacty fire a teacher (especially when they went to college and got a degree in teaching) for just not doing a good job. I don't know the answer, but I realize that NCLB is not working. Funded or not, it needs to go.",

   "The following is a letter I sent to several politicians from the Hooiser State some time ago. There answrs were either non-existant, or did not address any points I made.\n \n \"Governor Mitch Daniels:\n \n I am writing to you as a very concerned 4th grade teacher from an Indiana public school. Indiana's Public Law 221, and the federal No Child Left Behind Act, were both passed with great fanfare as a major overhaul of the educational system that would close the gap and \"leave no child behind.\" Unfortunately, both laws, and particularly NCLB, have set schools up for long-term failure. The reasons will be outlined below. \n \n Indiana and the ISTEP Test:\n \n 1. There are too many academic standards. Indiana was overzealous in creating the standards. Although there are roughly 24 broad standards, each is divided into many more specific standards. There are about 58 for 4th grade Language Arts alone! When you count the remediation after the long summer break, two weeks of ISTEP testing, and the need to cover other subjects, it is simply impossible to cover all the content mandated by the state in a single school year. Mastery takes a long time with students. All the newest brain research says that kids need to go over something many, many times before they commit it to long term memory. \n 2. Teachers are not really aware of what is on the ISTEP. (Meaning the test is not necessarily measuring what is being taught.) Although the vague response is that it is based on Indiana's academic standards, this is hardly sufficient from a teaching standpoint. Since the ISTEP test cannot possibly cover all the standards, it would make sense that the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE) would designate the most important ones to cover. Unfortunately, this does not happen. Many standards are assessed by only one or two questions, which hardly provide a meaningful means of judging the understanding of the concept. \n 3. The ISTEP does not take into account what the most cutting-edge research says on how the brain learns. Children have a peek learning window of about 20 minutes, less time with younger students. In other words, their attention span is very limited. (Some say this is the result of video games and television that stimulate students in a passive way with constantly changing scenes.) Tests should be presented to them in small chunks with frequent breaks. Regular tests we give them in class do not require hours to complete.\n 4. We also know that children do not learn in the same ways and at the same rates. Some students are better with math than reading, while others learn better when lessons are presented to them via the computer, or through group activities. Some will grasp a new skill immediately, while others may not until a year later. ISTEP expects students to be on the same page at all times. This is simply not reality. It tests them in a narrow way that does not give many the chance to show what they really know in multiple ways.\n 5. The expectation that special education students will achieve the same scores as their regular education peers is completely unrealistic. (This also seems to contradict portions of the federal special education law.) Children are defined as special needs because they have a disability that prevents them from learning at the same rate as other students. To expect them to do so simply because we say they will is lunacy. All children can learn, but they do not all do so in the same time frame. Special Needs children should be judged on more realistic standards established by there Individualized Education Plan. (IEP) \n 6. A test is a snapshot of a student at the moment they took the assessment. They may not have slept well the night before, had an argument with a parent or child only minutes before, or not had a good breakfast. All these factors affect performance. To judge students, and schools, on one standardized test, borders on immorality. Several tests over a period of time will yield a more reliable result. \n 7. Most students see little accountability with the ISTEP. It is less important to them then their daily assignments and grades. The scores will never come back to them in a form they will comprehend. It is simply not important to them. \n 8. Unfortunately, the scores do not come back in a way that teachers understand, either. The results are vague, and are not broken down by each individual standard. (And by question.)\n 9. Test results are usually not returned until months later. By this time, their instructional value is very limited. (The school year has moved on and new concepts introduced.) Funds for remediation are usually minimal, and do not allow for the individualized attention these students need to really help them. It is still necessary to teach the standards from the current school year. (A computer based ISTEP test would return results much more quickly.)\n 10. The ISTEP test is given in September, in stark contrast to most other states that give it in the spring. It supposedly measures skills from the previous academic year. How does this benefit the current teacher? It does not help that person improve their instruction when it tests what someone else taught the kids! In addition, the long summer break results in kids losing much of the knowledge from the previous year since brain research tells us that constant practice is needed to place skills in long term memory. We test them at the worst possible time in Indiana. \n 11. Public Law 221's ultimate goal of 90% of Indiana students passing the ISTEP is unlikely to be achieved for the reasons above. (Aside from the fact that it is a much higher target than is realistically possible.) In the next few years, a substantial majority of Indiana schools will be placed in the Academic Probation category and will stay there because of this unachievable goal. We have gone from high expectations to impossible expectations. \n \n Indiana and the No Child Left Behind Act:\n \n 1. NCLB has completely unrealistic expectations. It says that by the year 2014, all students will achieve proficiency on state assessments. This is simply not possible. That is like saying that every child in a class will get an A+ on every assignment and test! The world does not work that way. (We could pass out the test, give the students all the answers orally, and still not reach 100% passing since the students would make errors when they wrote down the answers.) If it did, there would be no poverty or economic problems whatsoever. Some will do better than others because of genetic and socioeconomic factors. That does not mean that we should not try to help all kids, it just means that not all will be as successful as we would like. \n 2. NCLB allows states to set up their own tests and content standards. As noted above, Indiana has some serious problems with the ISTEP/academic standards in its current form. \n 3. Indiana is using a statistical trick to delay the failure of schools to meet their Annual Yearly Progress (AYP) goals. These targets must rise toward the goal of 100% proficiency in 2014. As of 2004, 76% of Indiana schools made AYP. (Down from 77% the year before-an indication that the scores may be topping out under the current form of ISTEP.) However, that is likely to significantly drop within the next few years. Here is the reason: Indiana uses multi-year increments in its timeline to proficiency. The law requires that states make equal increments, but allows them to raise the targets every one, two, or three years. The Hoosier state has chosen the latter, which means that fewer schools will fail to make AYP in the near term. For example, for the 2002, 2003, and 2004 test, the passing score for Language Arts is 58.8%. However, this will rise to 65.7% in 2005, and 72.6% in 2008. The scores will then be expected to go up at equal increments from 2011-2014 until 100% is reached. Does anyone really believe this will happen? What drastic new overhaul of our schools, and a huge boost in funding, will make this even remotely possible? \n 4. The requirement that states break down scores by subgroups makes the job of attaining AYP even more difficult. Although this is basically a good idea that highlights where a school needs to make more effort, it also unfairly penalizes them. If even one subgroup fails to make the expected gain in scores, the whole school fails to make AYP! \n 5. Even schools that currently score in the 90% range on the ISTEP will fail to meet AYP by 2014. The goals of NCLB are simply unreachable. \n 6. Schools that significantly improve their scores, say from 45% passing to 75% passing, will be judged as inadequate! (It is important to remember that this includes special education students.)\n 7. NCLB also compares scores of one student group to another, such as the previous year's fourth grade to a new set of 4th graders the next year. This is like comparing apples to oranges. Each group is unique and simple comparisons like this do not yield useful data. (The most effective use of standardized test, in the opinion of many teachers, is to use them to track growth of individual students over time.)\n \n As a teacher, I am interested in true education reform that improves the opportunities of students. Although the recent reform movement has had good intentions, it is essentially \"re-arranging the deck chairs\" reform. It creates impossible goals and sets up our entire public school system for failure. As a state, and a nation, we can do much better.\"\n \n I wrote the letter in late 2004 and revised it in early 2005.\n \n Frustrated teacher,\n Brent:xbanghead",
