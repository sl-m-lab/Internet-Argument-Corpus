   "Watch: Wingnut Brigade Presser in Support of Military Gay Ban - Towleroad, More than gay news. More gay men\n \n Via HRC Backstory comes this video from today's CPAC conference.\n \n A group of right-wingers led by their fearless wingnut leader Elaine Donnelly had a press conference to rally against repeal of the military's failed \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy.\n \n Donnelly, along with Tom Minnery, Vice President, Public Policy, Focus on the Family, Tony Perkins, President, Family Research Council, David Keene of the American Service Union, Penny Nance of the Concerned Women for America, and Retired Admiral James Lyons presented their bigoted arguments (that according to all the latest reports have no basis in reality) in support of the ban.",

   "Personally I think the lady was some crazy meth head but hey people gotta out their anger towards someone....\n \n Gay Man Considers Suing Olympics After Homophobic Attack - Towleroad, More than gay news. More gay men\n \n \n A gay man says that the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympics (VANOC) has been negligent in responding to a harassment complaint he made after a woman verbally and physically attacked him and his friends at the Opening Ceremonies Rehearsal on February 8, Xtra reports:\n \n Olympics \"Sheppard says a woman who incorrectly insisted he and his friends were sitting in her seats repeatedly called him and his friends 'XXXXing XXXXXXX.' 'My friends heard it. A lot of people heard it,' Sheppard says. 'It was demoralizing.' Sheppard says the abuse continued even after ushers determined Sheppard and his friends were in the right seats. They were there to see a friend dance in the opening ceremonies. But the woman kept kicking their seats after they sat down, Sheppard says. She even muttered insults in his ear during the singing of 'O Canada,' he alleges. 'She kicked me in the back with her foot which left a red mark,' he says. 'If I was a man doing this to a woman, there would have been repercussions. What I want is fairness. The Olympics are supposed to be for everyone,\" he says.'\"\n \n Sheppard says the woman also picked up his Chilean friend's bag and threw it screaming, \"I'm not crazy, you XXXXing immigrant. Go back to your country.\" There are more details at Xtra.",
