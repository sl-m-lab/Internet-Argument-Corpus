   "Hi guys,\n \n At the moment I have purchased some websapce to hold my portfolio. Basically it has mysql database and runs an Apache server with support for php. \n \n I have never created a web site before and I have never really done any server side scripting. At the moment it is very basic just displays a table of the work I have done.\n \n This is an example of what it looks like at the moment\n \n http://www.bmdportfolio.com/display.php\n \n It basically query's the database and returns the information and displays it in a table. What I really need from you guys is to check to see if I have made any spelling mistakes or it does not look good in your browser.\n \n I am also going to add more interactivity to display the information to the user, basically a drop down box which allow someone to query the database for a specific technology demo that I have created.\n \n I will add Cascading Style sheets to improve the look of the display, so any general hints on creating a website or XHTML will be greatly appreciated.\n \n Thanks,\n Brian\n \n PS. I only started learning PHP two days ago so any tips on PHP coding would be greatly appreciated as well.\n \n Edit... Added filter",
