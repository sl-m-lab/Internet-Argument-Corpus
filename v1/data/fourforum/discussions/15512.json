It looks like, from the previews, Caesar will come into existence as a result of medical science and not as a result of his parents being time travelers from the future.",

   "I'm waiting for the Remake of \" Total Recall\" staring Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel, and Colin Ferrel. It's filming now and I believe due out in 2012.\n\n \n No, no, no, no, no, no, NO!!!!!!! I'm going to go on a bit of a rant on remakes, reboots and sequels in the movie industry.\n \n I will boycott the remake of Total Recall until the day I die.\n \n You see, there are some films that really shouldn't be remade or rebooted - I despise Tim Burton for remaking Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory AND Planet of the Apes. Can you imagine someone remaking Citizen Kane? Total Recall is one of the all time great 80s action flicks and to remake it would be to ruin the new one as well as spoil the old one in the same way Planet of the Apes ruined the magic of the original fanchise. Some old movies should remain old because a certain spark was captured during that time period.\n \n Speaking of Tim Burton, he happens to be so pretentious and remake-heavy that he's remaking one of his OWN FILMS!!! What a XXXX.\n \n Then there are some films that don't need to be remade or rebooted. Most fall into the category - Batman Begins (albeit a good film), Green Lantern, Tangled, Robin Hood, etc. We have no need for a Repunzel reboot! I know your avatar is from Tron Legacy, and it's not a bad movie, but Tron didn't need to have a sequel or a reboot, just faux-nostalgia hipster film makers decided to milk another old and slightly crappy but still cultish movie utter.\n \n Spiderman is in a league of it's own - It's on its 13th reboot, by my count.\n \n The sheer number of sequels in movies and video games is really shocking, these days. There was an article a while back stating that there are 86 movie sequels in development. Probably more now! Why can't film makers come up with new and interesting ideas anymore? I don't hate some sequels, just most of them (Indiana Jones is a 3 movie franchise and always will be - Star Wars is a three movie franchise also). The majority of movies don't need sequels, but the movie industry is constantly dishing them out for some unknown reason. I think people started noticing that generally sequels are bad and unnecessary a while ago.\n \n Someone needs to step up and show Hollywood how movie making is done - the old school way.\n \n So it's nice to see a movie like Inception which is new and interesting which has no need for a sequel. However, for every new and interesting movie idea which comes out, 10 remakes do, 5 of which ruin the original movie, another 8 reboots of something that had no need to be rebooted in the first place, and another 86 sequels.\n \n Mind you, I just got back from watching Kung Fu Panda 2, and it was alright.",

   "There are two types of not coming up with your own ideas style movies that I like - the first of which is when the original could have been good if it wasn't poorly executed. Battlestar Galactica falls here; if you haven't seen the new BSG, its seriously amazing... like, incredible.\n \n The second is when people make a movie or TV adaptation of a book, so like Game of Thrones. That way you can sift through good and bad story ideas and make a TV show or a movie out of the best ones. Game of Thrones is another incredible show that can be forgiven for not being inventive.",
