You KNOW that you're right and that your opponent is wrong, but your opponent doesn't want to accept the fact that they're wrong. They are saying a load of bull. What techniques do you use to fight against them to tell them that they are wrong?\n \n What if they know that they are wrong and they're lying but still don't want to admit it?\n \n Please give some ideas!!",
