This brings the total cost of these efforts I believe to about 280 billion. Forget the fact that this was excluded from the recently submitted national budget, could someone please explain the following exerpt outlining how the money will be spent:\n \n \"$400 million to reward nations that have taken political and economic risks to join the U.S.-led coalitions in Iraq and Afghanistan.\"\n \n I thought the whole idea of a coalition is that everyone joins voluntarilly for mutually beneficial reasons.\n \n http://www.cnn.com/2005/ALLPOLITICS/02/14/bush.iraqappropriation.ap/index.html",

That sounds familiar. Anyone have new estimates of rebuilding Iraqi damage we caused while bringing them democracy? Fallujah alone, still without utilities, will probably require another $80-billion. But we won the war against WMDs, tyranny or whatever it was, right? That's what I keep hearing in official press releases.",
