Gary Debusk of the Christ Church of Peace.\n \n The amendment up for discussion reads that marriage is,\"The legal union of only one man and one woman as husband and wife,\" and that, \"No other legal union that is treated as marriage or the substantial equivalent thereof shall be valid or recognized.\"\n \n Currently, nearly half a million people have signed the petition and many have been vocal about the issue over the last few months.\n \n \"The same-sex marriage would subject our children to a vast, untested social experiment,\" said Bishop Victor Galeone of the Diocese of St. Augustine.\n \n The Christ Church of Peace said it wants to be the Christian voice supporting gay marriages -- a voice some of the church's members said isn't as loud, but just as important, WJXT-TV reported.\n \n \"I would at least like the option to become part of his family and him to become part of mine,\" said legal-gay-marriage advocate Andrew Grayot.\n \n Supporters of the new amendment said they need about 100,000 more signatures to get the amendment on the ballot in 2008.\n",

The problem is that there are those here who want to use the term to their ends as an attack term. And they do, even though it applies on the gay-rights side of the fence as well. That's the handy thing about terms like that--they can be thrown around because they are vague and general, and no one typically bothers to qualify the term or elaborate as to 'why' they think that. It seems they think that the more they say it, the more it will be true, not realizing that whether or not it's true has nothing to do with how many times they say it. Also, I find the term thrown around HERE in an online forum much more than I do in face-to-face conversations, interviews, television forums, etc. Quite simply, it's because they can be more vitriolic in an online forum without having to see the face of those they say it to; there's a degree of anonymity here.

   "It certainly does. The problem is that there are those here who want to use the term to their ends as an attack term. And they do, even though it applies on the gay-rights side of the fence as well. That's the handy thing about terms like that--they can be thrown around because they are vague and general, and no one typically bothers to qualify the term or elaborate as to 'why' they think that.\n\n Are you even seeing the big picture here?\n By the definition that Steeeeve is using, he is essentially admitting they are \"qualified\" under that term.\n He has adopted a definition which is so broad he is including OTHERS that most people probably wouldn't include...\n \n \n \nIt seems they think that the more they say it, the more it will be true, not realizing that whether or not it's true has nothing to do with how many times they say it.

Come back to earth.\n How often do you see the term \"bigot\" thrown around on these message boards against other posters?\n \n \n \nAnd this idea that they are only on the defensive against religion and that it's only religion that is at fault may make good talking points, but it just doesn't pass muster with all the anti-religion generalizations and anti-religion talk that goes on in here, particularly from Matthew.\n\n Again, come back to reality...\n Religion started attacking gays CENTURIES ago...\n Religion is STILL attacking gays in this day and age...\n \n And what \"anti-religion generalizations\" are you talking about?\n \n And as a word of advisement, don't try to generalize the pro-gay side based on Matthew's statements. It's nonsensical, especially when a lot of the pro-gay side on these message boards have criticized Matthew's statements.\n \n It would be like lumping you in with Fred Phelps...\n \n \n \nEven though anti-religion is the last socially-acceptable form of bigotry, it's still bigotry.\n\n < snort <\n And you were complaining earlier about inaccurate classifications of bigotry???\n Talk about hypocritical!\n \n A LOT of the proclaimed \"anti-religion\" bigotry often boils down to some religion insisting on getting special privileges which are denied by law....",

   "you are paritial to your group though (gays) and intolerant of the views of those who oppose you. That fits the defintion does it not? Once again, disagreement is not being a bigot. If it were than everyone is a bigot.\n \n \n stop thinking in extremes and you will see this is not that difficult of a concept. Intolerant would imply that you wouldn't bother listening to an argument, you make an effort to hate, and you are too stubborn to be open minded and often think in extremes. So someone that believes the earth is flat and when someone tries to convince him/her otherwise they just cover their ears and call the person an idiot....that is an example of a bigot. If one says \"I don't think sexual offenders should leave near schools\" then this isn't a bigot...just someone who is partial to their view. An all male club might be another example. Are those all bigots? No, they just happen to have a club that is just for guys.\n\n \n \n So then what do you call people who want to exclude gay people from marriage? Exclusionists? I look at the world and I see that many people feel thier religious freedom over rules mine and tyhe well being of my family? They demand acceptance from me but are unwilling to return the same acceptance. Why is this? If some one is unwilling to accept a gay person the same as they are willing to accept a heterosexual. What would you call that person? A non accepter?",

Can you point me to a post where someone says gays should be exterminated? Or where homosexuality should die out? I don't think you can. But you HAVE made those sort of comments. Whenever this is pointed out, you always respond with something like 'I've just had enough and I'm finally giving back in like manner,' or something like that. But you don't--you say things to people here that haven't been said to you here, to people that haven't said them.\n \n Now, for what it's worth, you're point is well taken. I've come to realize since I started getting into debate here that the very opinion of gays not being able to legally marry is offensive to some, even as a point of argumentation. So for that reason I try more and more to make extra effort to be civil and avoid arguments more often here than I have no serious need to weigh in. And yes, gays have been mistreated all too often in numerous ways. At the same time, I think that is a message that is thoroughly and sufficiently given here. There's certainly no vacuum of message when it comes to that point. And I'm not sure of the value of making the point repeatedly to specific people who haven't abused gays, instead of to people who have.",

Not by our community, don't get me wrong, but by our government and elected officials.\n All too often I hear the argument that \"Gays/lesbians can't have children so why do they need marriage?\"\n More often than in heterosexual families, there is one parent who most likely will be the predominant parent and will tend to be a \"stay-at-home\" parent, like myself. \n Some of us are self employed which allows us to be there for our children. \n \n But we do so in full knowledge that we are unprotected...and so are our children.\n Because not enough companies offer domestic partner benefits, my son and I for a long time went without health care coverage. Thankfully this is not the case for us at this time, but I cannot predict the future, nor can I ignore the many GLBT families who aren't as fortunate. If anything were to happen to my partner, even though she and I have living wills, I cannot claim survivor benefits from our government or from her pension. Our home is in her name, even though we have both paid into it, but if anything were to happen to her, I would be slammed with enormous taxes and would most likely loose our family home.\n If anything were to happen to me, the custody of our son would actually revert to his biological father. A man who is extremely homophobic as well as racist. This is NOT who I would WANT to complete the raising of the son my partner has helped to raise since he was small. But there's nothing I can do about it because we cannot get legally married. \n If we were, there would be no guarantee that my partner would be allowed to continue raising our son, but the odds would be better stacked in her favor because she was my LEGAL SPOUSE.\n Without that, she's simply a roommate and a virtual stranger in the eyes of the law and has no say as to how or with whom our son would go.\n \n My state does not allow second parent adoptions, although it does allow gay adoptions by single parents. \n This issue is just as important to biological families as adoptive...and there are more and more of us as parents in the GLBT community every year.",
