   "George W. Bush's scholarship at Harvard:\n \nSep 16, 2004 | For 25 years, Yoshi Tsurumi, one of George W. Bush's professors at Harvard Business School, was content with his green-card status as a permanent legal resident of the United States. But Bush's ascension to the presidency in 2001 prompted the Japanese native to secure his American citizenship. The reason: to be able to speak out with the full authority of citizenship about why he believes Bush lacks the character and intellect to lead the world's oldest and most powerful democracy.\n \n \"I don't remember all the students in detail unless I'm prompted by something,\" Tsurumi said in a telephone interview Wednesday. \"But I always remember two types of students. One is the very excellent student, the type as a professor you feel honored to be working with. Someone with strong social values, compassion and intellect -- the very rare person you never forget. And then you remember students like George Bush, those who are totally the opposite.\"\n \n The future president was one of 85 first-year MBA students in Tsurumi's macroeconomic policies and international business class in the fall of 1973 and spring of 1974. Tsurumi was a visiting associate professor at Harvard Business School from January 1972 to August 1976; today, he is a professor of international business at Baruch College in New York.\n \n Trading as usual on his father's connections, Bush entered Harvard in 1973 for a two-year program. He'd just come off what George H.W. Bush had once called his eldest son's \"nomadic years\" -- partying, drifting from job to job, working on political campaigns in Florida and Alabama and, most famously, apparently not showing up for duty in the Alabama National Guard....\n \n One of Tsurumi's standout students was Rep. Chris Cox, R-Calif., now the seventh-ranking member of the House Republican leadership. \"I typed him as a conservative Republican with a conscience,\" Tsurumi said. \"He never confused his own ideology with economics, and he didn't try to hide his ignorance of a subject in mumbo jumbo. He was what I call a principled conservative.\" (Though clearly a partisan one. On Wednesday, Cox called for a congressional investigation of the validity of documents that CBS News obtained for a story questioning Bush's attendance at Guard duty in Alabama.)\n \n Bush, by contrast, \"was totally the opposite of Chris Cox,\" Tsurumi said. \"He showed pathological lying habits and was in denial when challenged on his prejudices and biases. He would even deny saying something he just said 30 seconds ago. He was famous for that. Students jumped on him; I challenged him.\" When asked to explain a particular comment, said Tsurumi, Bush would respond, \"Oh, I never said that.\" A White House spokeswoman did not return a phone call seeking comment....\n\n http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2004/09/16/tsurumi/",

   "I really love what the lazy bum George W. Bush had to say about poor people:\n \nIn 1973, as the oil and energy crisis raged, Tsurumi led a discussion on whether government should assist retirees and other people on fixed incomes with heating costs. Bush, he recalled, \"made this ridiculous statement and when I asked him to explain, he said, 'The government doesn't have to help poor people -- because they are lazy.' I said, 'Well, could you explain that assumption?' Not only could he not explain it, he started backtracking on it, saying, 'No, I didn't say that.'\"\nFrom the Salon article.\n \n I don't think Bush was ever able to hold down a job until he was selected as U.S. president by five members of the U.S. Supreme Court. And, when he became president, Dick Cheney essentially became the acting president.\n \n Bush vacationed most of the time. He slept through warnings about September 11, 2001. The guy is a worthless bum. He might be good at clearing brush but I think that's made up. His hands are too soft to have ever done any hard work like clearing brush.",

   "More on the ugliness and viciousness of Bush:\n \nBush once sneered at Tsurumi for showing the film \"The Grapes of Wrath,\" based on John Steinbeck's novel of the Depression. \"We were in a discussion of the New Deal, and he called Franklin Roosevelt's policies 'socialism.' He denounced labor unions, the Securities and Exchange Commission, Medicare, Social Security, you name it. He denounced the civil rights movement as socialism. To him, socialism and communism were the same thing. And when challenged to explain his prejudice, he could not defend his argument, either ideologically, polemically or academically.\"\n \n Students who challenged and embarrassed Bush in class would then become the subject of a whispering campaign by him, Tsurumi said. \"In class, he couldn't challenge them. But after class, he sometimes came up to me in the hallway and started bad-mouthing those students who had challenged him. He would complain that someone was drinking too much. It was innuendo and lies. So that's how I knew, behind his smile and his smirk, that he was a very insecure, cunning and vengeful guy.\" \nInsecure.\n \n Cunning.\n \n Vengeful.\n \n George W. Bush.
