   "DamEtel: [Anyone claiming that the United States is a Christian nation has] to overcome this simple fact: the founding document of our nation is the U.S. Constitution, which is a secular document, never once mentioning God, Jesus, or Christianity, and with its only two mentions of \n religion being restrictions on what the government can do. \n\n \n \nEasyRider: Actually you're wrong. The Constitution is dated, \"IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD...\"\n\n \n See, you're forced to resort to grasping at straws: flimsy ones.\n \n 1) I myself - an atheist - living in the year 2005 - have been writing dates, such as when the New Testament canon was finally established in 367 A.D., using B.C. and A.D. Both of these date-related abbreviations are religiously - 'Christianitally' - based. Using your general logic, I'd have to be a Christian: but I'm not, I'm an atheist. \n \n 2) Even to this day, it is customary - by tradition - to date official documents using \"in the year of our Lord\". My B.S. diploma - granted by a public, non-Christian university - states, \"Granted this sixteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety nine\". Using the phrase \"in the year of our Lord\" does not make that a Christian document, nor does it make the university a Christian institution.\n \n As the above two (and more could be given) examples show, the simple fact is that people and institutions using long-established and deeply engrained date designations - such as B.C./A.D. and \"in the year of our Lord\" - out of tradition and custom does not make something Christian.\n \n 3) Today there are secular alternatives to the Christian related manners for indicating dates, and these secular methods have been slowly spreading in use. For example, the secular B.C.E. (before common era) and C.E. (common era) can be, and in last several years have been being, used more and more instead of B.C and A.D. respectively. But back in the 1780s, these alternatives were not yet in existence. Therefore, we expect every historical document from the 1780s - that is, written by anyone following the standard calendar used in Europe and the to-be United States (as opposed to, say, the Muslim calendar) - to use such a Christian-based dating mechanism. In fact, if we were to uncover a document that claimed to have been written at the time of the Constitution, and had written on it - \"ratified in the year 1787 B.C.E.\" - we would know it was a forgery.\n \n \nEasyRider: And the Constitution only seeks to secure the rights that were granted to us by our Creator in the DofI [Declaration of Independence].\n\n \n 1) The Declaration of Independence is a listing of many grievances the colonies had against English rule: the document has been described as our 'divorce papers' from England. The Declaration of Independence does not found our government: it is the U.S. Constitution that does.\n \n 2) The Declaration of Independence was authored by a deist, Thomas Jefferson (see the next point also). So even if the Constitution were an extension of rights established by the Declaration of Independence, as you claim, it still wouldn't be Christian.\n \n 3) The Declaration of Independence does not mention Christianity or Jesus at all. It does explicitly mention God, once, but it calls that God Nature's God, not Christian's God. This one reference to God occurs in the very first sentence: part of the \"preamble\" that precedes the long list of grievances:\n \n \n\"When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume the Powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a \n decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the clauses which impel them to the separation.\" (Declaration of Independence) \n\n \n The \"Laws of Nature and of Nature's God\" is a deistic statement, referring to the deistic God and not the Christian God.\n \n \nEasyRider: I think you ought to read the book, \"Christianity and the Constitution\" for a more rounded understanding of these issues.\n\n \n I think you ought to read some history books to learn about the origin of deism, and its spread throughout Europe and the North American colonies just before the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution were written. You seem to be clueless about deism's role in shaping intellectual thought of that day.\n \n I think you also ought to read the following: \"The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America\", and if you still have time, \"The Godless Constitution\", and \"The Myth of Christian America\".\n \n \nDamEtel: Of course there is also the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli, in which both the Senate and the President of the United States explicitly stated that \"... the government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion...\". \n\n \n \nEasyRider: That just means the U.S. wasn't created as a Christian Theocracy, nothing more.\n\n \n No. It does mean that the U.S. was not created as a Christian theocracy, and that the United States was not founded as a Christian nation. This is not a Christian nation, it is a secular nation, populated by Christians as the majority.\n \n \nEasyRider: But here's a few for your indigestion:\n \n Concerning the outcome of the American Revolution, John Quincy Adams noted, \"The highest glory won from the American Revolution was this: it connected, in one indissoluble bond, the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity.\" \n\n \n And what founding document is that contained in? None! \n \n That is a personal opinion expressed by a Founding Father: it was not legally binding, wasn't voted on by members of Congress, wasn't ratified, and in therefore in no way establishes this as a Christian nation. \n \n The secular U.S. Constitution, on the other hand, is THE founding document of our nation, was legally binding, was voted on by members of Congress, and was ratified, and did found a nation.\n \n You can show numerous Founding Fathers publicly expressing their personal Christian beliefs and it won't demonstrate in the least that this is a Christian nation: all it will show is that this nation - founded by the secular U.S. Constitution - was populated by Christians as the majority. \n \n \nEasyRider: In a letter to Thomas Jefferson dated June 28, 1813, John Adams wrote: \"The general principles on which the (founding) fathers achieved independence were....the general principles of Christianity.\"\n\n \n Another personal expression, not found in any founding document, not legally binding, not voted on by members of Congress, not ratified, and so on. \n \n You have not at all countered my position, though you seem to believe you have.\n \n Now, let me show the personal opinions of other of the Founding Fathers. Let me start with Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence and the 1786 Religious Freedom Act of Virginia.\n \n \n[Thomas] Jefferson himself was skeptical about much of Christianity. He wrote in one place, \"I'm a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus\", but then went on to dismiss the miracles altogether and said that the Bible as a whole was, \"a groundwork of vulgar ignorance, of things impossible, of superstitions, fanaticisms, and fabrications\".\n (Lecture 7 \"Religion and Revolution\" of the audio disc series \"American Religious History\" by Professor N. Allitt of Emory University) \n\n \n \n\"One day the dawn of reason and freedom of thought in the United States will tear down the artificial scaffolding of Christianity. The day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the Supreme Being as His father, in the womb of a virgin will be classed with the fable of the \n generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter.\" \n (Letter to John Adams, April 11, 1823 http://www.deism.org/foundingfathers.htm ) \n\n \n \n\"Millions of innocent men, women, and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burned, tortured, fined, and imprisoned, yet we have not advanced one inch toward uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half of the world fools and the other half hypocrites. To support roguery and error all over the earth.\" \n (Thomas Jefferson, Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781-82 http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/jefframe.htm )\n \n\n \n Of course numerous other statements made by Jefferson could be presented to offset your claimed (but for the current matter of interest, worthless) evidence.\n \n Look, you and I could trade pro-Christian and anti-Christian statements made by Founding Fathers' until one of us dies and it wouldn't make any difference at all. The question on the table isn't about the Founding Father's own personal opinions concerning religion, but rather about the founding of our nation and its government. What was voted on by Congress, and ratified, and made legally binding, and thereby established the states as a new nation; not what Founding Father X believed. And regarding the only matter of interest here, you simply don't have the goods. Sorry, but facts are facts. You lose. Deal with it.\n \n \nEasyRider: Founding father Noah Webster proclaimed much the same message when he said, \"The religion which has introduced civil liberty is the religion of Christ and His Apostles....This is genuine Christianity and to this we owe our free constitutions of government\" (History of the United States, 1832). \n\n \n Yawn. Same as your others: worthless in the context of the current discussion.\n \n Oh, and by the way ...\n \n \n\"The founders of our nation were nearly all Infidels, and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected [Washington; Adams; Jefferson; Madison; Monroe; Adams; Jackson] not a one had professed a belief in Christianity.\"\n (The Reverend Doctor Bird Wilson, an Episcopal minister in Albany, New York, in a sermon preached in October, 1831: as quoted in John E. Remsberg, \"Six Historic Americans,\")\n \n\n \n \n\"Among all our presidents from Washington downward, not one was a professor of religion, at least not of more than Unitarianism.\"\n (The Reverend Doctor Bird Wilson, an Episcopal minister in Albany, New York, in a sermon preached in October, 1831: as quoted in Paul F.

   "See, you're forced to resort to grasping at straws: flimsy ones.\n \n 1) I myself - an atheist - living in the year 2005 - have been writing dates, such as when the New Testament canon was finally established in 367 A.D., using B.C. and A.D. Both of these date-related abbreviations are religiously - 'Christianitally' - based. Using your general logic, I'd have to be a Christian: but I'm not, I'm an atheist. \n \n 2) Even to this day, it is customary - by tradition - to date official documents using \"in the year of our Lord\". My B.S. diploma - granted by a public, non-Christian university - states, \"Granted this sixteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety nine\". Using the phrase \"in the year of our Lord\" does not make that a Christian document, nor does it make the university a Christian institution.\n \n As the above two (and more could be given) examples show, the simple fact is that people and institutions using long-established and deeply engrained date designations - such as B.C./A.D. and \"in the year of our Lord\" - out of tradition and custom does not make something Christian.\n \n 3) Today there are secular alternatives to the Christian related manners for indicating dates, and these secular methods have been slowly spreading in use. For example, the secular B.C.E. (before common era) and C.E. (common era) can be, and in last several years have been being, used more and more instead of B.C and A.D. respectively. But back in the 1780s, these alternatives were not yet in existence. Therefore, we expect every historical document from the 1780s - that is, written by anyone following the standard calendar used in Europe and the to-be United States (as opposed to, say, the Muslim calendar) - to use such a Christian-based dating mechanism. In fact, if we were to uncover a document that claimed to have been written at the time of the Constitution, and had written on it - \"ratified in the year 1787 B.C.E.\" - we would know it was a forgery.\n \n \n \n 1) The Declaration of Independence is a listing of many grievances the colonies had against English rule: the document has been described as our 'divorce papers' from England. The Declaration of Independence does not found our government: it is the U.S. Constitution that does.\n \n 2) The Declaration of Independence was authored by a deist, Thomas Jefferson (see the next point also). So even if the Constitution were an extension of rights established by the Declaration of Independence, as you claim, it still wouldn't be Christian.\n \n 3) The Declaration of Independence does not mention Christianity or Jesus at all. It does explicitly mention God, once, but it calls that God Nature's God, not Christian's God. This one reference to God occurs in the very first sentence: part of the \"preamble\" that precedes the long list of grievances:\n \n \n \n The \"Laws of Nature and of Nature's God\" is a deistic statement, referring to the deistic God and not the Christian God.\n \n \n \n I think you ought to read some history books to learn about the origin of deism, and its spread throughout Europe and the North American colonies just before the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution were written. You seem to be clueless about deism's role in shaping intellectual thought of that day.\n \n I think you also ought to read the following: \"The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America\", and if you still have time, \"The Godless Constitution\", and \"The Myth of Christian America\".\n \n \n \n \n \n No. It does mean that the U.S. was not created as a Christian theocracy, and that the United States was not founded as a Christian nation. This is not a Christian nation, it is a secular nation, populated by Christians as the majority.\n \n \n \n And what founding document is that contained in? None! \n \n That is a personal opinion expressed by a Founding Father: it was not legally binding, wasn't voted on by members of Congress, wasn't ratified, and in therefore in no way establishes this as a Christian nation. \n \n The secular U.S. Constitution, on the other hand, is THE founding document of our nation, was legally binding, was voted on by members of Congress, and was ratified, and did found a nation.\n \n You can show numerous Founding Fathers publicly expressing their personal Christian beliefs and it won't demonstrate in the least that this is a Christian nation: all it will show is that this nation - founded by the secular U.S. Constitution - was populated by Christians as the majority. \n \n \n \n Another personal expression, not found in any founding document, not legally binding, not voted on by members of Congress, not ratified, and so on. \n \n You have not at all countered my position, though you seem to believe you have.\n \n Now, let me show the personal opinions of other of the Founding Fathers. Let me start with Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence and the 1786 Religious Freedom Act of Virginia.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Of course numerous other statements made by Jefferson could be presented to offset your claimed (but for the current matter of interest, worthless) evidence.\n \n Look, you and I could trade pro-Christian and anti-Christian statements made by Founding Fathers' until one of us dies and it wouldn't make any difference at all. The question on the table isn't about the Founding Father's own personal opinions concerning religion, but rather about the founding of our nation and its government. What was voted on by Congress, and ratified, and made legally binding, and thereby established the states as a new nation; not what Founding Father X believed. And regarding the only matter of interest here, you simply don't have the goods. Sorry, but facts are facts. You lose. Deal with it.\n \n \n \n Yawn. Same as your others: worthless in the context of the current discussion.\n \n Oh, and by the way ...\n\n \n \n BAM!!! The winner by a knock-outemoticon_xgood ",
