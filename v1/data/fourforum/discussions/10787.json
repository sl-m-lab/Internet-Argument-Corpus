   "In the not so distant future, women may be \"farmed\" for the purposes of pleasing men, according to Angry Harry, a men's right activist. \n \n \n \nif anything, the chances are not so much that women will take over the planet and exterminate the men, but that men will start to 'farm' women for their very own purposes - just like they currently do with cows.\n \n And, quite frankly, unless women in the west get their act together and start supporting men rather than making enemies out of them by supporting divisive feminists who do little more than continually stir up hatred toward them, and who, therefore, also undermine the whole well-being of their very own societies, then they shall surely deserve to be tamed, domesticated and harvested for the good of the planet, and, of course, for the contentment and happiness of the men who dwell upon it!\n \n\n Source: http://www.angryharry.com/esKirstyWarkGlows.htm\n \n \n \n \n His reasoning?\n \n \n \nListen carefully. Basically, women were designed by Nature to taste good to men when they are hungry; and that, fundamentally, is the end of the matter. The Universe does not seem to have figured out any other long term purpose for them. And even the ancients clearly recognised this by emphasising the important bits of women in their sculptures...\n \n Realistically, women have only got one hope when it comes to having a happy future. They will have to taste good to men. And if they do not do this, then they are toast; because they will have nothing else to offer.\n \n The converse, however, is not true. Men do not have to taste good to women to be of value to them. Without men - nothing. No houses or factories would be built or maintained. No roads would be constructed.\n \n It is men who create, construct, develop, operate and maintain just about everything that represents the progress of humans on this planet. \n \n This all suggests that women are going to have to behave more like women than like men, or they will find themselves heading for a fall. \n \n\n Source: http://www.angryharry.com/esAreWomenBecomingRedundant.htm\n \n \n \n \n \n \n So I guess women will have to act like Barbie again? Or if men want to live like the monks, they will just engineer artifical wombs and women will go extinct. I don't have an opinion on this, it just scares me.",

   "From Angry Harry's:\n \n Western men die some five years earlier than women. They suffer more from nearly every medical disease and ailment that there is. And yet, far more money is spent by governments on women's health than on men's health. Men are also nowadays educationally disadvantaged significantly compared to women; with the curriculum, the teaching methods and the resources being designed to cater far more for women and girls than for men and boys. Men make up 80% of the homeless. There are more of them in social service care-homes as boys. They are many times more likely to be wrongfully arrested, wrongfully imprisoned, mugged, assaulted or murdered. They are 5 times more likely to lose their children when families break down, 4 times more likely to lose their homes, 4 times more likely to commit suicide, 20 times more likely to be killed or injured at work, 20 times more likely to be imprisoned, and, probably, more than 100 times more likely to be demeaned, denigrated and ridiculed by the mainstream media. Men also pay much more in taxes than women but receive far less in benefits from the government.\n \n In other words, when compared to women, men are significantly disadvantaged when it comes to their health, their lifespans, their homes, their children, their education, their families, the tax burden, the law, the benefit system, and even when it comes to their own personal safety. \n \n They are nowadays also being heavily discriminated against in the work place.\n \n How is it possible, therefore, that women are being 'oppressed' more than men?\n \n In what areas?\n \n Where?\n \n This was a kind of interesting writing passage to me because I think sexism is misunderstood, and while some of the statistics are off, there is some truth in what Angry Harry is talking about. \n \n For example, men do disproportionately die in wars, male veterans live homeless in the streets, male veterans' disabilities are not taken care of by our government, men can't cry (and women are supposed to be like that if they want to work in what is still a man's world - and should not be only a man's world), men experience more limitations in their relationships with their children, what may be a more limited communicative bridge between the left and right brain hemispheres, they can not experience pregnancy or nursing, and they have less endurance, among other comparitive physical traits. \n \n On the darker side of the spectrum for either of the sexes, women have Twiggy role models, but men are stuck with Chuck Norris.\n \n Which is worse or more harmful to a human being's spirit?\n \n But men farming women? Although it's been science fictionalized by others besides Harry, that too is nothing new under the sun.",

   "Hello All,\n \n Why in the world would anyone in his right mind, want women cloned and thus, 'farmed'?\n \n Modern American women are automatons, running around with chips on their shoulders the size of California Redwoods. I know this is a generalization, but given what young women have been taught on college campuses during the last 30 years; that they are victims regardless of any remedies applied, and that men are the victimizers, farming women would only increase the problems.\n \n Women have more legal rights than men.\n Women have more wealth than men.\n Women are given victim status in both law and society, releasing them from personal culpability.\n \n Allow me to expand on that last point. Legally speaking, a woman who is drunk is deemed legally incapable of given 'informed consent' to a sexual encounter.\n \n However, a man who is drunk is NOT given such a legal status, a drunk man IS held to a higher standard of legal culpability in a sexual encounter.\n \n A man and a woman meet in a bar. They both get drunk. They go to a hotel room (or his place or her place) and have sex.\n \n She wakes up the next morning and decides she really didn't want to have sex.\n \n The courts have found and shall continue to find, that while the woman was NOT capable of giving 'informed consent' because she was drunk, the man while drunk IS held culpable for both knowing the woman was too drunk to give consent, and that he was thus, raping her because she hadn't 'really' given him informed consent.\n \n So much for equality under the law.\n \n Such madness pervades American universities.\n \n The Duke Rape Case is a prime example. Those three young men were considered GUILTY by the mere fact that a woman had accused them of rape.\n \n I remember seeing signs that said \"Real Men are Responsible\". Some 88 professors signed a petition calling for the expulsion of the three students. Women's groups basically called for their heads on a platter, and used the three of them as an 'example' of the innate hostility of men towards women.\n \n We men don't have innate hostility towards women, we are TAUGHT hostility toward women by women's rights groups, liberal/social progressive/politically correct scum whom target men because we are men.\n \n The three Duke students were vindicated (after several millions of dollars in lawyers' fees), but I've yet to see a single written or spoken apology from the 88 professors, the women's groups, the individual women with the signs, or the women on campus at Duke, nearly all of whom wanted those young men's heads on stakes.\n \n I've said it before and I'll say it again:\n \n There is nothing between a feminist's legs, which is worth putting up with that which is between her nose and her chin.\n \n Cheers from the Rockies\n emoticon_xhoho :xbanghead emoticon_mad emoticon_xkill emoticon_xhoho",

   "I'm tired of women (girls) telling me how I am inferior because of my gender. This clearly does not benifit her other than re-assuring herself that she is at least as good as a man. I have no good response to such an attack, as they are almost always backed up by scientific evidence. I must content myself with simply telling a joke, laughing, and changing the subject or ending the conversation as quickly as possible. I am deeply saddened by such attacks, in the same way a black man would be if I called him the n word. But even he has the means of expressing himself through anger, which I am deprived of when confronted by a girl. My question is: Why do these attacks occur, and what can I do about it?",

   "Response to Neanderthal:[*]It sounds like you also walk around with a chip on your shoulder. \"There is nothing between a feminist's legs, which is worth putting up with that which is between her nose and her chin.\"[*]The \"drunk rape\" case you've presented is hardly believable. Please present a case number or article to prove the fact.[*]The case about the three Duke students mishandled from the begining (i.e. accounts from the stripper) and the media did not help the matter by presented misinformation to the public.[*]My suggestion: Lead your life by the big brain and no more drunken sexual encounters, no matter how fun it is. emoticon_xhohoResponse to Existantia:[*]Yes. Women are allowed, only recently, to join men on the front lines.[*]However, you should concede that there will always be a disproportionate number of male causalties because women do not have the upper body strength to handle front line duties. And yes, ultralight technology has closed the \"strength\" gap requirements, but it's still there.[*]If your argument will be that physical strength is not an absolute requirement in the front lines, then I will have to counter with the fact that a front line soldier (regardless of sex) must carry a 12-lbs rifle, 60-lbs rucksack, 10-lbs flak-vest, and capable of manuevering with all that gear during battle.[*]Same argument can be used for firefighters. I do not want an unconscious 180-lbs person stuck in a burning building and a female firefighter just don't have the strength to carry the victim out.

Why are the women's physical requirements for the Army less than the men's? Fighting and doing battle with the enemy require strength, and regardless of sex, you must have that strength. That means, if women can't meet the requirement, then they should not be allowed in the army. Lowering the requirement for women is ridiculous.",
