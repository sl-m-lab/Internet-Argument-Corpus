   "I want to get a consensus here on this subject. I am not asking if you like carbonated beverages or not. The question is when you refer to carbonated beverages, do you usually say \"soda\" or \"pop?\" I got in some kind of argument yesterday in which it was discussed that it would be expected for me to have used the word \"pop\" in a story I wrote when I actually used \"soda\" because of where I'm from. I have lived in the same suburb in Eastern Kansas all my life. But I prefer to use the word \"soda\" over \"pop\" for so many reasons. So along with the question at hand (the word you usually use) could you also give some kind of idea of where you are from. I want to see if it is based upon where you live or your personal preference.\n \n If there is any questions here, \"carbonated beverages\" include (but not limited to) Pepsi, Coke, RC, Sprite, 7 UP, Dr. Pepper, Pibb (whatever), any root beer, Sierra Mist, Grape Soda, Orange Soda, Strawberry Soda and the like. Go ahead and ask if you're not sure but I think I pretty much spelled it out. (And if you couldn't guess by this post, I usually go with Soda instead of Pop.)",
