   "I am currently writing a book. But, I would like to share my advice for free. \n Here are some ways to make your child more sucessful in school.\n \n 1. Tell them that they have a study period every night. A minimum of one hour. Have them do any homework they have, and if they have none, have them study the topics they are studying in their classes. Example: If your son or daughter is learning about the Trojan War in Social Studies, have them read the chapter.\n 2. If you have time, check over your son or daughters homework. Study with them. \n 3. Give them a better bedtime. They should not stay up past nine at night on a school night. Eleven at night maximum. (I make my kids go to bed at nine at night)\n 4. Get them up in the morning before school, have them take a shower, eat a balanced breakfast. No sugar or anything that will get them hyper.\n 5. Encourage that they keep homework well organized and neat. Some teachers dock points for wrinkled papers.\n 6. Make sure if they need help, you give it to them.\n I am writing a book on how to keep a child well educated, and away from what most kids are becoming today. The whole gangster/whore trend is not good. Cause all those kids do is be bad and not care about school.\n But, in my book, I will tell you how to care for your child, how to keep your child acedemically engaged and sucessful in school, and so on.\n But, off the topic, here are some ways to keep your child under the influence of academics.\n 1. Do not let them party unless an adult is at the house with those kids. (Children can accidentally or intentionally have sex and could result in pregnancy. The mother will ruin her future. She will not be able to attend a college. She can't be away from her baby all the time. She could, but most women don't. It is harder to focus in high school. Most girls drop out, or fail school life.\n 2. Do not hesitate to search your childs room once in a while. Make sure your child has no illegal drugs or alcohol in their room. Some schools now, are starting to do drug searches every day. Kids have lockers searched.\n 3. Do not let your child participate or join a gang.\n 4. Do not let your child wear clothing that makes her look like a slut, or the boy look like a player.\n If you all follow these guidelines, you can influence a better career for your child one day and make a better life for them.\n I speak at all the middle and high school in Washington D.C every year. I influence kids, PTA'S, and parents themselves through a simple friendly school leter that these are the steps to a better education.\n Some parents blame the teachers, or board of education. They are not the problem. Sometimes, it is the parents. They don't care what their child does at home. They just assume the child has done their homework. But, parents are the problem. Another reason is the kid. He or she tries to rebel or act like a hard XXX. Like his or her XXXX does not stink. But, in the end, if the parents don't follow these steps or what others suggest, their child will fail.\n -John Milosevic.",

   "I hate the concept of homework! A kid should have a life apart from school.\n\n Heh?\n \n Homework's there to make kids work on their own and limit the amount of 'spoon feeding' of information. Parents helping kids when the kids are stuck with homework is good. Parents always helping kids with homework is counter-productive. It makes the kids less independent and when harder and more challenging work comes in the future, the kids will struggle. Mummy and daddy won't be able to help you with lots of A-level, university and job work.\n \n Another use of homework is for practice. There's no point paying a teacher \u00a325k a year to sit in front of a class while they practice mental arithmatic.

   "There is probably some good advice in there somewhere, but I think there are problems with it. Firstly, do you seriously expect to keep this up until your child is 18? Allowing a teenager no input on homework, bedtimes etc isn't going to teach them any negotiation skills, or responsibility, or any other adult skills. Such rigid rules make no allowances for special circumstances, and basically say \"I don't respect you one bit\".\n Also, searching your child's room at random is wrong. You think that will build trust? You can't do that when they leave home, and it again shows an attitude of zero respect for your child. \n Basically, these rules show no respect for the child at all, and also would leave them woefully unable to cope on their own when they leave home to go to that college you want them to get into. I've seen people from very strict households like this go mad when they get away from home, because they can do what they like. That doesn't always happen, but where such strict rules are combined with an ultimate lack of respect for the views of the child, you set up a very dangerous situation. You have to instill values so your child does sensible things for themselves, not cause you make them do it.\n A supportive attitude from parents is the most important thing for children. That may entail strict rules, but saying that without them kids \"fail\" is simply wrong.",

   "hmm, I'm curious. I have a question for you.\n \n Have you ever been a kid? I'll go into a little more detail below.\n \n \nI am currently writing a book. But, I would like to share my advice for free. \n Here are some ways to make your child more sucessful in school.\n \n\n well good luck with your book, unfortunately I don't much like the stuff you're advocating.\n \n \n\n 1. Tell them that they have a study period every night. A minimum of one hour. Have them do any homework they have, and if they have none, have them study the topics they are studying in their classes. Example: If your son or daughter is learning about the Trojan War in Social Studies, have them read the chapter.\n \n\n This depends on how old the kid is. I think I've mentioned I went to a Montessori school through 8th grade. Through 6th grade we didn't have homework, but we had work we had to get done at school. As kids get older it is necessary to work a little on their own. As they get older they should be taught to work independantly, but I think parents should offer to help if the kid wants (sometimes I will ask one of my parents to proofread a paper for English or something). But I think one major thing is school and learning in general should be made fun. Instead of simply making your kid read a chapter, maybe help them understand how it applies to the real world. Make up scenarios to help them understand it. Of course with the amount of busywork given in school these days I would be surprised if a kid ever gets less than an hour of homework and has any time to actually explore topics they enjoy.\n \n \n\n 2. If you have time, check over your son or daughters homework. Study with them. \n \n\n And what do you do if it's wrong? How do you approach it? Tell them it's wrong and they should correct it? Try to help them understand what's wrong? Call their teacher?\n \n\n 3. Give them a better bedtime. They should not stay up past nine at night on a school night. Eleven at night maximum. (I make my kids go to bed at nine at night)\n \n\n How old is your kid? How old is the target audience's kid for whom you are writing this book? I wish I could get to bed at 9:00 every night. Just the other night (a school night) I got home from a track meet at 11:30. Now I was responsible and got all my homework done before so I could go straight to bed. But what if a kid has homework that will take longer than until 9:00?\n \n There comes a point where a kid knows the consequences of staying up late (they're tired the next day). It comes down to time management. If a kid waits until the last minute to complete an assignment, they may have to stay up later. These consequences will teach them better than you forcing them to go to bed early or do homework earlier ever will.\n \n Also what about non-school nights? Any justification for this? I'll stay up until 1:00 or so sometimes on non-school nights but I'll sleep in until at least 10:00 most of the time a little later. Why is this bad?\n \n \n\n 4. Get them up in the morning before school, have them take a shower, eat a balanced breakfast. No sugar or anything that will get them hyper.\n \n\n Very wise advice. But is it really necessary that littler kids take a shower before breakfast every day? Obviously when kids get older it becomes necessary to take a shower every morning. But does a 9-year old really need to take a shower every morning?\n \n \n\n 5. Encourage that they keep homework well organized and neat. Some teachers dock points for wrinkled papers.\n \n\n If your only reason for doing something is that teachers will dock points if you don't do it it's a pretty lame excuse. Now I agree it is important to stay organized, but there are more important reasons than lost points. But again, is you organizing your kids binder or telling them to going to really teach them the lesson? Explain to them the importance of being organized and let them do it. If you don't let them learn for themselves and make them rely on you they will never learn to stay organized in real life, a very important thing to learn.\n \n Also a kid needs to learn what works for them. If the notes/handouts are organized sufficiently for the kid to learn and remember what's going on, then that's fine. For example, I'm taking AP History (supposed to be a college-level class, FAR from it). Our teacher constantly looks at our notes telling us whether we are taking good notes and talking about how \"nice\" she is for checking notes and telling us to do better. \"Most college professors won't care\" she says constantly. I say be like a college professor. She constantly gets on me for not copying every word down from the blackboard. But I remember everything, have aced every test, and pretty much know the material. This is about the kid learning how to stay organized in a system that works for them, and you doing it for them won't help.\n \n\n 6. Make sure if they need help, you give it to them.\n \n\n Also make sure that they know when to ask for help. If you get a note from your teacher about how the kid isn't doing so well, or when talking to your kid about a subject realize they really don't know what they're talking about, you may want to help them a little. But you shouldn't be constantly on them about homework, trying to \"help\" them, because most likely uninvited help will not be viewed as help.\n \n\n I am writing a book on how to keep a child well educated, and away from what most kids are becoming today. \n \n\n What's wrong with what kids are becoming today?\n \n\n The whole gangster/whore trend is not good. Cause all those kids do is be bad and not care about school.\n \n\n Please explain this gangster/whore trend. Some kids don't care about school, and that's not because of a trend, but the fact that school simply doesn't seem to be about learning anymore and seems to have more point. It seems to be a lot of busywork with do this homework \"because we told you\". Read this, memorize this, zzzzzz. And I hope you didn't write the phrase \"all those kids do is be bad\" in your book. Maybe you could do with an English class.\n \n \n\n But, in my book, I will tell you how to care for your child, how to keep your child acedemically engaged and sucessful in school, and so on.\n But, off the topic, here are some ways to keep your child under the influence of academics.\n \n\n You could help them keep a love of learning. This may involve getting them out of public schools because they seem to be simply a way of keeping kids occupied rather than teaching them, but if they actually learn stuff and enjoy doing it, it's a big step. I don't think you appreciate this. I don't know you, but the way you say \"keep your child under the influence of acedemics\" makes it seem like you don't even appreciate true learning and were you a teacher would incorporate a ton of busywork. But I guess I don't know you very well, just an educated guess.\n \n \n\n 1. Do not let them party unless an adult is at the house with those kids. (Children can accidentally or intentionally have sex and could result in pregnancy. The mother will ruin her future. She will not be able to attend a college. She can't be away from her baby all the time. She could, but most women don't. It is harder to focus in high school. Most girls drop out, or fail school life.\n \n\n lol, I love this, \"accidentally or intentionally have sex\". But seriously, any parent shouldn't leave their kid at a party unsupervised by a responsible adult. That seems like common sense.\n \n\n 2. Do not hesitate to search your childs room once in a while. Make sure your child has no illegal drugs or alcohol in their room. Some schools now, are starting to do drug searches every day. Kids have lockers searched.\n \n\n This is just plain wrong. It is a trust issue. My parents know that I don't have drugs or alcohol in my room, and if you need to search your kid's room to see if they have drugs/alcohol in their room you have other issues. You should know your kid enough to know if they are doing drugs or alcohol, not to mention the privacy issue (this has been mentioned by others sufficiently)\n \n\n 3. Do not let your child participate or join a gang.\n \n\n another no-brainer depending on how you define gang. A gang is usually a group of people who commit acts of violence. I know of no parents who let their kid join a gang, this is just an ignorant statement.\n \n\n 4. Do not let your child wear clothing that makes her look like a slut, or the boy look like a player.\n \n\n Of course they will be a slut if they wear clothes that make them look like a slut. And if they wear a suit and tie they will cease all unprofessional activity, right? Not. There are limits but you shouldn't dictate everything they wear. I don't know how you define those clothes, so I don't know whether to disagree or agree.\n \n \n\n If you all follow these guidelines, you can influence a better career for your child one day and make a better life for them.\n \n\n and make sure that once they turn 18 they will never speak to you again.\n \n\n I speak at all the middle and high school in Washington D.C every year. I influence kids, PTA'S, and parents themselves through a simple friendly school leter that these are the steps to a better education.\n \n\n Well I live in Montgomery County MD and influence kids, adults, and anyone else reading this board that you are full of shi*.\n \n\n Some parents blame the teachers, or board of education. They are not the problem. Sometimes, it is the parents.\n \n\n Blame them for what? You don't even address what they are blaming them for. I'll assume it's the kid not learning. This should be the responsibility of the school system/teachers to provide an opportunity to learn and the responsibility of the kid to take advantage of that and ask any questions if they are unclear.\n \n\n They don't care what their child does at home. They just assume the child has done their homework.\n \n\n Well they do get report cards interims to tell of the kid's progress and the teacher can contact the parent if the kid is having a lot of problems in the class. But if the kid is doing fine in school, you should assume that the kid is telling the truth if they say they have done their homework. You should NOT do it with them as this helps them not one bit. And what do you mean \"don't care what their child does at home\"? What would that child do that they don't care about?\n \n\n But, parents are the problem.\n \n\n Sorry if I disagree unless the parents don't let their kid do homework or stay after to get help from a teacher.\n \n\n Another reason is the kid. \n \n\n Yes, sometimes it is the kid, but not for the reasons you give.\n \n \n\n He or she tries to rebel or act like a hard XXX. \n \n\n Apparently you were never a kid? You blindly followed everything your parents told you? You agreed with every decision they made, liked it when they made decisions for you, etc? It is a natural part of life to question everything. And as a kid you only know what you like to do. You don't like other people making decisions for you. And although your parents are acting in your best interests, kids want to make decisions on their own. There are some things that parents just have to make decisions about for their kids, and it is perfectally natural for kids to not like it but that's life. I am sure you are trying to work in the best interest of your kids, but maybe you should let up a little. Yes you are the parent, you have the final word on your child, but depending on how old they are, let them make SOME of the decisions.\n \n\n Like his or her XXXX does not stink. But, in the end, if the parents don't follow these steps or what others suggest, their child will fail.\n -John Milosevic.\n\n Ah I see, the kid knows nothing. Unless they do what I say they will fail. Have you ever stopped for a minute and wondered, what if they do fail? Will it be the end of the world? Maybe they will learn from their mistakes? You seem to be holding your kids' leash very close and tight, trying to save them from failure. Maybe you should let them go out and make a few decisions on their own. Guide them but allow them to choose some things. Let them fail, see what it feels like. Help them understand that you will always be there for them, but that it's their life. I don't envy parents, I understand it must be a hard thing to let your kid make a decision when you think they know better, but sometimes you have to let them step out on a limb, let them fail, because that's life. As much as you'd like to be, you won't be there forever. And if you don't teach them what failure is like, what it's like to have to deal with it. How to get back on their feet and pave their own way through life, they may not have failed, but they have missed a huge lesson in life that they need to learn.\n \n You see, my grandma was like that. My dad's mom had to control everything, even up to her death. She controlled who her kids dated, which friends they had, everything. When they left her kids went a few different ways. My Aunt dropped out of college, not knowing how to live for herself. My grandmother bailed her out. Up to her death she was giving money to my aunt to live. My other aunt went the other way. The day she turned 18 she ran off with a black guy (she would NEVER let them date black people, she was a tad racist too). She didn't even go to my grandmother's funeral. My dad was a bit angry at her as well but he forgave her and they had a generally good relationship. Now as much bad as she did to her kids and their lives, her actions did have one good thing. My parents now realize that that is not the way to raise a kid.\n \n I go to school, I tell them how I'm doing, and they trust me. I have never gotten more than 2 B's with the rest A's in school so far. I tell them what I get on assignments, what I'm struggling in. Sometimes I'll ask them for help, but they never demand that I get help from them. I play baseball as well as track at school and although I don't have the time to do drugs and alcohol, they don't search my room, because they trust me. They let me choose my classes at school and have said that if I want it, they may have suggestions for me, but that if I want to make the decision they will support it. I have not dated yet but they have said that if I do get a girlfriend that they do want to meet her but will not say no.\n \n Take a look at your kid. Put yourself in their shoes, no not in your view of their shoes, trying to succeed through them, but really put yourself in their shoes. Think about how they feel. They want to be independant. Even if you don't think that's what's best for them, they do. Think about how you would feel if your parents did this when you were a kid. I'm sure you love your kid, and I'm sure you are trying to help them. But imposing your will on their entire life and telling them what is best for them makes them miss out on a large part of life. Failure is a part of life, and one of the best ways to learn is through failure. Instead of constantly trying to succeeed through your child, let them make some decisions (I am not advocating that they make ALL the decisions) and understand that there are consequences to every action. You don't wear a coat outside, you'll be cold. You decide to play outside the whole morning, you have to get your homework done in the evening. Every action has a consequence, and that's a huge lesson in life. This will not be taught by continually policing your children, searching their room, forcing them to keep neat, and controlling their life.\n \n And lastly your view of children is disturbing. \n \n \n\n He or she tries to rebel or act like a hard XXX. Like his or her XXXX does not stink.\n \n\n Again you don't seem to even try to understand why they are doing this. You talk of it possibly being the parent's problem, maybe this is your problem. If you were trying to force your decisions on my life you can bet I'd make a stink about it. It's my life, I understand the consequences of my actions. Maybe you should have talked to an actual kid when writing this book as well as maybe remembering what it was like when you were a kid.",

I did.\n My biggest \"mistake\" was proposing that teachers be held accountable for their students' performance just as managers in a business are responsible for their employees' performance. You'd have thought that I was the anti-christ after suggesting that. My opponent's campaign was run by the ex-president of the teacher union and they even had the gaul to solicit campaign funds during classtime and had students filling out postcards for my opponent. On the day of the election, they manned the phones at the union headquarters and urged people to vote for my opponent. How do I know that? Caller ID showed where the calls originated. I, also, did my homework and studied the teacher union contracts as well as the district's financials. I learned all about class size premiums, longevity bonuses, coaching pay, retirement padding, etc., At the time, we were paying over $8k/year/student.

No one wants to fail and everyone needs positive pushes. \n \n OH, the biggest one yet, learn to listen when you ask,\" anything I need to know?\" Your job isn't over just because you got the question out.\n\n \n Good to see another earthbound parent that takes the time to talk to her kids.\n I have 3 kids, all in college; 2 undergrad, 1 grad school. I've found that good kids tend to have good friends. It's not a hard and fast rule, but rather a general observation. My wife and I always stayed active in our kids' grammar and HS years. We went to all of the conferences, previewed the anti-drug propaganda courses (Quest and DARE), etc., etc., and were able to do so because my wife and I decided very early that only one of us would work outside of the house while the kids were growing up. Too many parents nowadays think that two incomes and all of the toys it affords them are better than one-on-one contact time with their kids. They're wrong. I've got the proof. :)",

   "Popping my two cents in on this discussion. Mother of 4 and two are in college. We still have a 17 year old and an 11 year old at home. Sooooooooooo been there done that and none of our girls were juvenile delinquents that failed at school and no we didn't have to keep them on a short leash. \n \n What works? Don't stop getting to know your child's school environment once they leave the elementary years. Meet the teachers, know the school policies and education agenda, and never be an absentee parent on the campus.

I have seen the best of parents turn out the worst of kids and vice versa. There is no 100% solid formula for raising them properly as there are way too many factors involved.

   "On class size.\n \n It depends on the subject, the lesson style and the people in the class.\n \n If it's a lecture style lesson you can have large classes and just send out all disruptive pupils. Being a lecture, they should easily be able to catch up on anything they miss and tend to learn quickly that messing around isn't good. Other classes where discussion takes place (for me, primarily English and Classics), class sizes need to be small (5-15) so that everyone can contribute. There's fairly little writing involved and it's mainly talking.\n \n I think disruptive pupils should just be sent out. I don't mind chit-chat during a class, everyone does it, but going out of your way to irritate the teacher and everyone else really isn't acceptable.\n \n -Wez",

I have. You have peers grading your quizes (so the teacher doesn't have to). There are handouts (that I've personally seen) that were \"mimeographed\", not copied on a printer, but mimeographed as they were done 30 years ago, telling me that this was a 30 year old lesson. It doesn't take much prep time to present 30 year old lessons, IMO.\n Teachers DON'T work 12 hour days. I drive by the parking lots of schools every day. The cars aren't there when I drive past in the morning and they aren't there when I drive past the schools on my way home.\n When you get to high school, many of the tests are done on computer-graded cards that are the \"fill in the dot\" variety.\n And all of this occurred in a \"National Blue Ribbon Award\" winning high school.",

   "Teachers don't mark in schools if they can help it. In secondary school, college and university, there is a lot of 'behind the scenes' work. Lesson plans can't be re-run for 30 years in the UK. Science has progressed too much for that, history develops and changes too quickly, while English and similar subjects keep changing topic to stay with current trends. Pupils don't want to analyse the same books for decades; new books are often used.\n \n I have no idea how people can be using 'fill in the dot' tests much. In the UK, History, Classics, English and most humanities are essay subjects, while the sciences are far too complicated to use 'fill in the dots' tests.

I'd be interested to hear the NEA's rationale for all this though. I know over here teachers are regularly working until midnight on weekdays on marking and preparation. Parent's Evenings (I presume this is the equivalent of your teacher conferences) are, as the name suggests, still held outside of school time, with no extra pay. Similarly extracurricular activities are all organised by teachers or parents volunteering their time, with no remuneration. It's also not uncommon for teachers to spend their own money on books and equipment for their class, if the school is short of cash.",
