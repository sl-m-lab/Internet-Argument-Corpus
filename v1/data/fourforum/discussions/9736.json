   "I find it so ironic. Honestly, it is the majority of the black community that is responsible for the oppression of gays. When they themselves are repulsed by such a condition. Black pastors do nothing but preach against homosexuality and will not under any circumstances compare the gay civil rights movement to their own. African american men as a result will NOT come out of the f***in closet because of it, further causing the gay community harm. I think its sickening. 'Please, give us compassion for our struggles, but f**k yours!' It's not just this article but I have seen homophopia at it's best in the african american community at large. Please tell me, WHY of all people?!\n \n http://www.timesdispatch.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=RTD%2FMGArticle%2FRTD_BasicArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1173350627596&path=!news&s=1045855934842\n \n Gay students denied voice\n They say homophobia, outdated rules block creation of groups at some historically black colleges\n \n BY DIONNE WALKER\n THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Apr 8, 2007 \n \n \n HAMPTON So lured was April Maxwell by the promise of the black college experience, with its distinct traditions, that she enrolled at Hampton University in 2001 without visiting the campus.\n \n A lesbian who is open about her sexual orientation, she arrived eager to join the extended Hampton family.\n \n Instead, \"I felt like I was the only gay person on campus -- it seemed like nobody was really out,\" said Maxwell, now 24.\n \n She channeled her isolation into organizing a gay support group, but a panel of students and faculty denied it a charter. The panel recently denied a second attempt at chartering Students Promoting Equality, Action and Knowledge, headed by underclassmen after Maxwell graduated.\n \n It's a tug-of-war that's emerging at other black schools, where students say outdated rules and homophobia block them from forming the gay groups common at majority white institutions.\n \n At Hampton, where rules govern everything from overnight guests to student dress, officials insist they don't discriminate against gays. They say they're simply enforcing a limit on the number of student groups.\n \n But some students here see more than a conservative approach to the regulations. They, and many others at the nation's more than 100 historically black colleges and universities, say a broader suspicion of homosexuality keeps gays in the shadows at these tradition-heavy schools.\n \n \"You've got to recognize the history of HBCUs,\" said Larry Curtis, vice president for student affairs at state-supported Norfolk State University, where students recently formed a gay-straight alliance. \"Most of them were founded by religious organizations.\"\n \n Church leaders are often cited as setting the tone regarding homosexuality across the black community.\n \n Nationwide, black pastors have opposed same-sex marriage and shot down comparisons between the struggles for civil rights and gay rights; others have attacked \"down low\" bisexual men for contributing to the rising AIDS rates among black women, though the topic is a matter of debate in the public-health community.\n \n But just as gay students can rightfully request campus inclusion, so too can black college administrators deny it, argued the Rev. William Owens, head of the Coalition of African-American Pastors in Memphis, Tenn.\n \n Owens and other black pastors are worried that, along with dismal marriage rates, socially accepted homosexuality \"is a threat to the black family.\"\n \n In 2002, the issue of gays on black campuses grabbed the attention of the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group that organizes annual \"coming out\" days.\n \n \"We would send out information to all the colleges and universities about getting national coming out packets, and for some reason the only institutions they were not hearing back from at all were the historically black colleges,\" said the campaign's diversity manager Brandon Braud, who began calling campuses.\n \n He learned of gay groups at two historically black schools: Washington's Howard University and Spelman College in Atlanta.\n \n Administrators elsewhere denied having gay students, or said that although gays attended, \"they're very underground,\" Braud said.\n \n Formed mostly across the segregation-era South, historically black colleges emerged as academic training grounds and finishing schools for blacks entering white society.\n \n The most esteemed schools earned a reputation for students with impeccable manners and clean-cut behavior.\n \n \"So much of our campus is focused on this ideal of 'the Hampton man' and 'the Hampton woman,'\" said Michael, a transfer student and SPEAK member who, like the group's president, is closeted and declined to let his last name be printed. \"Men walk women home -- traditional Southern values.\"\n \n Gay students have enjoyed far greater visibility at Virginia's large, majority-white institutions.\n \n At private Hampton, April Maxwell said she knew lots of gays and found support among pockets of students, regardless of sexuality.\n \n \"The people who are in charge, I really don't think they're for it,\" Maxwell said.\n \n But school officials say there is a limit on the number of student groups.\n \n \"No organization is given any type of special treatment,\" said Barbara Inman, assistant vice president for student affairs. \"The university doesn't have a position on gay and lesbian faculty and staff members.\"",

   "When homosexuals start having to go to a different school, drink from a different water fountain, sit in the back of the bus, and simply go through a quarter of what blacks had to go through then come back and talk. It is insulting to have the comparison.\n\n \n Hi, Steeeeve. I am new to the forum, and if I post this incorrectly, please forgive me. \n \n I teach African American history at a small college. I understand that many African Americans feel insulted by anyone else's experiences being compared with theirs, because they feel such comparisons discount the suffering that African Americans have endured. It's certainly true that in many respects the African American experiences in this country have been unique. Other groups were not enslaved. Other groups were not subject to the horrible numbers of lynchings that African Americans primarily endured. Other groups were mostly not subject to the exclusion and discrimination by law and in practice that African Americans have faced. We could, of course, talk about Native Americans experiencing gencide or mass extermination and destruction of their cultures. We could also talk about the discrimination and exclusion faced by Chinese immigrants and by Japanese immigrants and by undocumented immigrants from Latin America today. But it is true that African Americans endured and survived a unique and devastating oppression, one that must never be discounted or minimized or rationalized away. \n \n At the same time, I think we can learn something from making comparisons of the experiences of different groups that have endured oppression and discrimination. That's not to argue that all forms of discrimination and oppression are the same, because clearly they are not. But there are certain parallels between the forms of oppression, because groups in power have tended to use similar methods of keeping other groups out of power. \n \n I think it's also true that African Americans in many respects paved the way for other groups to win their freedom and equal treatment under the law. There is a long and tangled history of women's rights activists and African American freedom movement activists joining in common cause, and sometimes being in conflict with each other. Scholars have written about how the African American civil rights movement paved the way for the women's movement to make advances. To say that is not to insult African American activists; it's to praise them. \n \n Gay people do experience intense discrimination and persecution. Gay people have been subject to hate crimes, and still are. Gay people are not treated as equals under the law. Gay people are denied the right to marry in most states. Until recently, gay people could be arrested and jailed simply for loving a partner. Gay people are still subject to potentially losing custody of children. Gay people still fear being beaten up or killed for walking down the street holding a loved one's hand. Is that the same as experiencing slavery or segregation laws or the lynching that black people endured? No, not the same. But it's still bad, and it's still wrong. Our aim as human rights activists is not to measure relative suffering, but to eliminate it....all of it. \n \n Congressman John Lewis, the former leader of SNCC, talks openly about the parallels between the oppression of gay people and the oppression of African Americans. No, they are not the same. But they are not entirely different either, and the rationale for discriminating against gay people sounds not all that different from the rationale that bigots used to use for discriminating against African Americans. \n \n Thanks for listening.",

   "Hi Ohioprof,\n \n Thanks for posting and it is nice to have a professor join us here on the forums. Please feel free to continue to post (as if I could change it).\n \n As for your comments, it is not drawing parallels that frustrate me but the blanket comparison that does. If one says \"blacks were treated badly and so are gays therefore blacks should understand and support gay rights\" then this is not drawing parallels. People with blonde hair are often made fun of as being stupid but I don't think this is anywhere near what blacks had to go through. \n \n So yes, showing some parallels is fine and I agree that abuse against homosexuals is wrong and should be punished. The idea that blacks need to agree with gay rights just doesn't make sense eventhough some of the same struggles have occured.\n \n Anyway, keep up the posting and welcome.\n \n Could you also confirm whether or not you were a poster on another forum similiar to this one?",
