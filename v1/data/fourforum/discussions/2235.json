That isn't very intelligent because there are many things that are alive that are killed all the time without remorse, plants being among them. The egg is alive, in the sense that all cells are alive. The mere fact that it is alive does not guarantee anything. If you want to make the argument that we shouldn't abort because it's human, that's another story.\n \n No one disputes that the fetus is alive. I know that it's human, since if it has human DNA that's what it is called. Bootfitter has excellently summed up the argument. It is about whether or not we consider the developing fetus as a 'person' under the law, and if the rights of the fetus should supercede that of the mothers.

When it comes down to that choice, the perceived rights of both parties are typically seen as equal by 'pro-life' individuals and a decision must be made by the parties involved which equally-valued-life should be saved. Since we are currently unable (due to lack of a means of communication) to involve the fetus in the decision, the mother must ultimately make the decision.\n \n A distinction that is often overlooked in debates like this is that a pro-life individual generally views the fetus and the mother to have equal intrinsic value... the rights of one not superceding the rights of the other. Generally, a pro-life individual believes that the right to live is the most fundamental right that supercedes any perceived 'lesser' rights.\n \n Believing that the perceived right of a fetus to live supercedes the perceived right of a woman to be free from pregnancy in no way diminishes the value of the woman.

Everett Koop estimated that about 4,000 \"third trimester\" (after 26 weeks) abortions occur each year in the United States, and that \"less than five percent of that number have induced abortion because of a known defect in the fetus.\" \n The article doesn't say how many are te result of fear for the \"mother's\" life and I couldn't find much other than some Pro-abortion sites that claim the usual.\n \n \n\n The point of the first poster was that we can't abort because the fetus is alive. That isn't very intelligent because there are many things that are alive that are killed all the time without remorse, plants being among them. The egg is alive, in the sense that all cells are alive. The mere fact that it is alive does not guarantee anything. If you want to make the argument that we shouldn't abort because it's human, that's another story.\n\n \n How about \"it is alive AND HUMAN\"? That certainly differentiates it from that famous fern plant. :) And while all cells may be living, not all cells contain the ability to propogate the human species, fertilized eggs are unique in that respect. \n \n\n No one disputes that the fetus is alive. I know that it's human, since if it has human DNA that's what it is called. Bootfitter has excellently summed up the argument. It is about whether or not we consider the developing fetus as a 'person' under the law, and if the rights of the fetus should supercede that of the mothers. If it does, then it reduces women to mere carriers for the truly important creature within. I'm not willing to do that.\n\n \n If we consider a fetus a human life, then its rights should be on par with its \"mother's\". To treat it otherwise would cheapen all life. If we did we would establish a hierachy of \"rights to live\". Who then who gets top billing? Dad? Mom? Junior?\n \n Since the law addresses partial birth abortion and not abortion in general, I'd like to refocus on that area. The exception wasn't put in the legislation because Congress heard testimony that there was NEVER a medical need to perform a partial birth abortion. There is a need to be acurate on what defines a partial birth abortion under the legislation. It is the following:\n \n \"The Congress finds and declares the following:\n \n (1) A moral, medical, and ethical consensus exists that the practice of performing a partial-birth abortion -- an abortion in which a physician delivers an unborn child's body until only the head remains inside the womb, punctures the back of the child's skull with a Sharp instrument, and sucks the child's brains out before completing delivery of the dead infant -- is a gruesome and inhumane procedure that is never medically necessary and should be prohibited.\n \n (2) Rather than being an abortion procedure that is embraced by the medical community, particularly among physicians who routinely perform other abortion procedures, partial-birth abortion remains a disfavored procedure that is not only unnecessary to preserve the health of the mother, but in fact poses serious risks to the long-term health of women and in some circumstances, their lives. As a result, at least 27 States banned the procedure as did the United States Congress which voted to ban the procedure during the 104th, 105th, and 106th Congresses.\"\n Ref:Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003",

   "Slight clarification here...\n \n ...and if the perceived right of the human fetus to live should supercede the perceived rights of the mother to be more comfortable. \n \n I am not aware of anyone in the 'pro-life' camp who believes that the right of the fetus to live is greater than the right of the mother to live. When it comes down to that choice, the perceived rights of both parties are typically seen as equal by 'pro-life' individuals and a decision must be made by the parties involved which equally-valued-life should be saved. Since we are currently unable (due to lack of a means of communication) to involve the fetus in the decision, the mother must ultimately make the decision.\n \n A distinction that is often overlooked in debates like this is that a pro-life individual generally views the fetus and the mother to have equal intrinsic value... the rights of one not superceding the rights of the other. Generally, a pro-life individual believes that the right to live is the most fundamental right that supercedes any perceived 'lesser' rights.\n \n Believing that the perceived right of a fetus to live supercedes the perceived right of a woman to be free from pregnancy in no way diminishes the value of the woman. (Unless, of course, a pregnant woman is seen as less valuable than a non-pregnant woman.)\n\n \n \n Very eloquently and succintly stated. emoticon_xgood",

The problem is that these are the organizations that are actually preventing abortions by providing family planning counseling, birth control and medical services to mothers and their children. When you take away those kinds of services what is left are more unwanted pregnancies, unwanted children, or children that can't be afforded.\n\n Do your research on Margaret Sanger as mentioned above and tell me that's the vision that you agree with. OK? Then we'll talk about \"family planning\" organizations.\n \n\n If you really want to stop abortion get active on the front end. Education, birth control, medical services, and opportunity. Make sure unwanted pregnancies don't happen in the first place and that kids born in the this world will have some sense of safey, love and opportunity - and won't starve.\n\n I have 3 unmarried kids, 17, 19 and 21 and not ONE pregnancy. I'm doing my part, I taught them that abstinance was the only 100% safe form of birth control.\n \n\n Abortion laws and stopping the work of family planning providers will not stop abortion - it will simply stop safe ones and make unhealthy pregnancies more frequent.\n\n There's nothing \"family\" in family planning as I see it. The bad far outweighs any benefit, IMO.\n \n\n And for those who truly are irresponsible with the right to choose - they truly are disgusting, but you can't change that - you can't force them to be responsible in their sex, during a pregnancy or later - ragardless of law.

I'm glad abortion is totally a decision between a woman and her doctor in Canada, and there seems to be no danger of that situation changing.\n \n Abortion isn't the ideal situation. However, I don't know how we would get to an ideal world where no one would have an unwanted pregnacy, without ending all sexual freedom. I don't think women or men would ever be willing to do this.\n \n Men will never understand what it is like to be pregnant. The fetus is dependent on the health of it's female host. She needs to be both physically and also emotionally equiped to carry that fetus to term. If she is pressured or coerced into carrying a fetus she does not want, she may not care about looking after herself, affecting the fetus. In her emotionally distraught state, forced to carry a fetus she does not want, she may try a more dangerous method of abortion. Women always have, when safe and legal choices are not available. She may abuse that unwanted kid or even kill it after it is born. \n \n I'd also like to know if people opposing abortion, would support it in cases of rape. If people do think it is acceptable in cases of rape, why is that if the fetus is the primary concern? If you believe it is just a little baby, surely it's not it's fault who the father is. It should have a right to life, like any born baby. The emotional capacities of the mother is secondary, if it is like a born baby. You wouldn't kill a born baby if its father was a rapist.

The fetus is clearly a living being.\n\n \n Viability is certainly a difficult marker to peg to. \n \n However so is being sentient. According to Webster's the definition of sentient is \"responsive to or conscious of sense impressions\". Essentially this means that you are able to analyize and think about your state of being. I'm fairly certain that third trimester fetuses would not qualify as sentient beings. I think a good argument could be made that even a newborn doesn't meet this definition. \n \n Perhaps a good parallel would be to animals. Newborns, on many levels, very similar to animals. Learning for both is of the conditioned response variety. Furthermore, animals are not able engage in metacognition (thinking about their thoughts) so far as we can tell. They simply don't possess the tools to do so. Newborns are in a similar vein, they do not possess the language tools necessary to metacongnate.\n \n What does this mean? Well, it seems that birth is also somewhat of an arbitrary point also. Fundamentally the newborn is no different than a fetus. It has the same cognitive and sensory capabilities as it did in the womb. Perhaps the only real differences are resulting from our perceptions of the birthing event. That is, because we imbue the event with so much meaning the newborn necessarily takes on that 'meaning' when in fact the nature of the human doesn't warrant such a change. Boil this down and it again comes back to the potentiality of a newborn to become a sentient being. \n \n I would like to let it be known that I am not advocating infanticide at all.

Outlawing abortion will not change society. Changing society will perhaps eliminate the desire for abortion, which is what you want. You're right, there is a general opinion against abortion (depending on who is doing the poll and what the questions asked are) but most are also not in favor of the government determining what a woman has to do with her pregnancy.\n \n I know several people who disagree with abortion but would never countenance the government determining woman's reproductive future for them.\n \n \n\n I have no problem with your description. It was truthful. But when a pro-life person presents a similarly graphic description of abortion he is villified. What do you mean by the \"graphics\" pro-lifers present? You have a problem if pictures of abortion are shown? How is a picture that much different than a graphic description? How is the picture not truthful?\n\n \n A description can be skipped over as soon as one knows it is graphic. A picture, by it's nature, cannot be skipped over unless one has prior knowledge it is there. Pictures do nothing but elicit an emotional response and does nothing to further discussion, imo. A description can also elicit an emotional response, but it is the lesser of two evils.\n \n \n\n Each person has a different experience. But that does not mean that every person engaging in their own experience of abortion is not wrong. \n\n \n Why did right and wrong enter it to that? Since you know you cannot know each person's life and experience, why do you feel that you can judge on each person's life and experience? \n \n \n\n Outlawing abortion does make sense when one is dealing with these problems. Allowing abortion diverts attention from the real problems and presents a baby as the problem.\n\n \n Actually, outlawing abortion would devert attention from the real problem and present the girl as the problem... when the real problem is that the girl feels threatened by people around her until her only option is to get an abortion. \n \n Why not attack the problem, instead of what the problem causes? \n \n \n\n It must begin with the view that sex is something more than simple physical pleasure, something more than entertainment, more than infatuation, more than inevitable between two young people...\n\n \n And that's a worthy goal. Outlawing abortion will not do that. That's a societal view, and though abortion may be a consequence of that view (though I sort of doubt that), it isn't the cause. What you're proposing is a bandaid to fill the cracks in a dam... it will do zero good toward your goal.\n \n Why shouldn't sex be for the pleasure of physical contact? Should we follow the church's example and treat it as something dirty that we shouldn't talk about? Why should it be more, as you suggest? Unless you have a compelling reason that will change society, I think you're on a fruitless quest.",

Virtually everyone thinks they are in the right, heck, Hitler thought he was doing the human race a favor when he killed 25 million jews.\n \n \n Does that make it right though? Of course not. As C.S. Lewis said well in \"The Case for Christianity\" \"Very rarely will a man in an argument say 'To heck with your standards, their wrong.'\" But it shows that we all know that there is a moral standard somewhere. We just differ on exactly what it says.

But I can't handle this big yard, I wish I had a fence to separate it...\" (Or something like that, that was the general idea) Basically she says she wants something to go on, something to measure where she's at, what she's doing right or wrong.

(And I have really enjoyed Perretti's work, myself.)\n \n However, if there is an absolute set of morals somewhere, then we should be able to know them in some fashion. If we cannot know them, then they are of no use to us.\n \n To call something 'evil' requires a definition for what 'evil' is. Who makes that definition? We (humanity) make up all the definitions for all the words we use. There isn't some standard lurking 'out there' somewhere to create the definitions for us. WE create them. Some people believe that these standards are inspired by God and written on our hearts. But that assumes belief in a God. There may or may not be a God, no matter how much one believes that there is a God.\n \n Many (most?) people are not comfortable without Sally Roe's fence. They need boundaries of some sort. They need definitions of 'good' and 'evil' in order to strive for 'good.' But, being of an evil human nature, they will inevitably fail to always be good.\n \n Take a step back from that line of reasoning for a moment. Consider that humans are humans. They are not inherently 'good' or inherently 'evil'... anymore than a raccoon or a butterfly is inherently good or evil. Humans are humans.\n \n Once you are able to see that life really isn't 'scary' or fully of anarchy without some arbitrary lines drawn in the sand for you, the need for boundaries disappears. It's not as though everyone will run around without what you now see as 'morality.' Everyone will run around doing pretty much the same things they are doing now, but there won't be a need to label actions as 'moral' or 'immoral.'

   "How can you have physical evidence of what isn't physical?\n\n You cannot. That's my point. That does not necessarily mean that a non-physical X doesn't exist, but it does mean that the existence of a non-physical X cannot be proven to exist.\n \n That's the beauty of faith in God and the concept of absolute morality. It must be accepted on faith and faith alone. When one seeks actual knowledge of such things, one sees that such knowledge cannot be obtained, because they are not of the physical world in which we reside. Such things are either created in our minds, or exist in another realm (physical or otherwise) and can influence our minds from that realm to convince individuals of those things. Does that make sense?\n \n Take God... if God exists, God does not exist in the same realm as we do, (or else we could have physical proof of God's existence). Assuming God exists in another realm that is not accessible by our physical bodies or able to be perceived by our physical senses, then somehow or other, God must make God's self known to us. The only access God would have to us that I can think of is our minds [edited--<] and our souls by extension, though I do not believe our 'souls' exist in the same realm as our physical bodies either. \n \n Of course, if God became a part of this physical realm through Jesus, the individuals living at that time who witnessed his miracles would have some physical evidence that Jesus was able to perform seemingly amazing feats. However, we are not in that position. We are in the position of Thomas, The Doubter. We have not seen, yet we have the option to believe or not believe.\n \n The New Testament does certainly not constitute physical evidence that Jesus was God, unless the assumption of divine inspiration of the authors is first believed. It is certainly within the realm of possibilities that the stories of Jesus the human being were embellished to assign to Him divine characteristics. I'm not suggesting they were embellished... just that it is easily conceivable.",

Without changing the mindset first you will only kill women by making a safe procedure that so many women desire (as evidenced by the number happening) into an unsafe procedure that many women would still desire and perform.

It will not stop promiscuous sex, it will not stop teen pregnancies, it will not stop adultery, abuse, emotional and financial struggles.

   "I see your point. (And I have really enjoyed Perretti's work, myself.)\n \n However, if there is an absolute set of morals somewhere, then we should be able to know them in some fashion. If we cannot know them, then they are of no use to us.\n \n \n\n \n I happen to argue that we do know them. Their wired into us, we know them, we just ofton ignore them. I've done this myself. We know what is right and what is wrong, we just ofton sacrafice doing what's right for being comfortable, or fitting in.\n \n \n \nTo call something 'evil' requires a definition for what 'evil' is. Who makes that definition? We (humanity) make up all the definitions for all the words we use. There isn't some standard lurking 'out there' somewhere to create the definitions for us. WE create them. Some people believe that these standards are inspired by God and written on our hearts. But that assumes belief in a God. There may or may not be a God, no matter how much one believes that there is a God.\n \n \n That's why we have to use God's word. You may not believe the Bible is God's word, but without something to go by, it's gonna be \"My view is right, you don't agree, I kill you.\" It'll be the Dark Ages all over again.\n \n \n \n \nMany (most?) people are not comfortable without Sally Roe's fence. They need boundaries of some sort. They need definitions of 'good' and 'evil' in order to strive for 'good.' But, being of an evil human nature, they will inevitably fail to always be good.\n \n Take a step back from that line of reasoning for a moment. Consider that humans are humans. They are not inherently 'good' or inherently 'evil'... anymore than a raccoon or a butterfly is inherently good or evil. Humans are humans.\n \n Once you are able to see that life really isn't 'scary' or fully of anarchy without some arbitrary lines drawn in the sand for you, the need for boundaries disappears. It's not as though everyone will run around without what you now see as 'morality.' Everyone will run around doing pretty much the same things they are doing now, but there won't be a need to label actions as 'moral' or 'immoral.' What does it ultimately matter what we label actions anyway?\n \n \n \n But Raccoons and butterflys don't have free will. They aren't sentient. We got the blessing/curse of the intelligence neccessary to make moral choices. We are similer to animals as we both are flesh and blood, both have brains, both eat and drink and breath. But they don't think like we do.\n \n Can you honestly say that you'd feel entirely comfortable if all laws, rules, and morals just disappeared? Because without that line in the sand, God's law, then there is nothing to compare it to, and if there's no right or wrong.....well I'll be making my own country the day this happens.

And anything that would subject them to the fear, harm, loneliness, hopelessness, and desperation of abortion--economically, politically, physically, socially, or emotionally--I will strongly fight against. \n \n Abortion is not liberation, it is imprisonment. It is not power, it is powerlessness. It is a sentence on mother and child imposed by society. I believe that women are better than abortion. I believe that women should raise themselves above the Trojan Horse of abortion. I believe that society should not pressure women into abortion. I believe that there are better alternatives to women for their emotional, mental, and physical health. \n \n \nI should stop all practises that I do not personally agree with?

You're living in a pipe dream if you think illegality will stop it from happening. Most who are desperate enough to get it in the first place would not let the law stop them.\n\n You're saying that more than 4,000 women per day would die?\n \n \n I said nothing about abortion. A picture in general can be what I described. One cannot choose not to see a picture unless there is prior knowledge it is there. If a person does not want to see it, a person should not be forced to.\n\n Whether you said anything about abortion or not the question still stands. Can a picture be made disgusting in and of itself or must the act depicted necessarily be disgusting? Take the pictures of the beheading of Berg and the prisoner abuse photos. Are the pictures the problem or are the actions shown in the pictures the problem? \n \n Now we can come to some middle ground on who should see pictures that are graphic and gruesome, as I am not sure that everyone should be exposed to them. I do not believe that in the cases coming out of Iraq and I feel the same way about those of abortion. But in professing that not all should see the pictures, I do not deny what they depict. I personally prefer more pleasant pictures than those showing abortion as I would guess most do. But I have no illusions as to the unpleasantness of abortion.\n \n \nThen make the pressuring people the problem by trying to stop it. If you do then she wouldn't have an abortion. Do you think that they would stop pressuring her (an illegal action already) if an abortion was illegal? They would do it themselves if they can't find another to, a highly risky thing for the girl.\n\n So we agree that the mother and the baby are not the problem? Good. Let's work on the solution that will prevent family, friends and society from pressuring women into abortion. Do we agree that abortion isn't the solution of the woman's problems? \n \n \nI'm sorry but the world has changed. I'm sorry that you can't see that. Views about sex have changed too much for you to ban abortion and expect things to be all better. It will not stop promiscuous sex, it will not stop teen pregnancies, it will not stop adultery, abuse, emotional and financial struggles.

Those who take medication that will almost guarantee birth deformities will be forced to have a child if they find themselves pregnant. I don't agree with the government forcing them to have a child that will undermine their physical and emotional wellbeing.\n\n A different view of the current one of sex will change things. Do you contest any of the claims I have made about sex outside of marriage? \n \n You are skipping a few essential steps when you talk about people being forced to have children against their will. If you talk about people being forced to have sex then that might be a problem.\n \n \nOh can they? Thank you :p I'm sure they'll be relieved to know that. But if she becomes pregnant then you'll deny them that choice, no matter their financial, emotional or mental state. I don't know what you mean by \"a willful frustration of the procreative aspect of sex\". Do you mean you'll deny them birth control?\n \n Deny them what choice when they become pregnant? The choice to engage in activities that may lead to pregnancy and the choice of abortion are quite different. Everything changes when the woman becomes pregnant. There are 3 involved instead of 2. \n \n In the Catholic view there are two aspects of sex: the unitive aspect and the procreative aspect. \"Willful frustration of the procreative aspect of sex\" means the use of contraception. \n \n \"What is quaintly called Birth Control . . . is in fact, of course, a scheme for preventing birth in order to escape control.\" (\"The Surrender upon Sex\" The Well and the Shallows  G.K. Chesterton)\n \n \nThe church certainly hasn't done much about it, besides transfer those bishops and priests to places they aren't known.\n\n I agree that the Church hasn't taken a strong enough stance on this evil in the past. Now it seems to be on the right track. Perhaps the Church was too benevolent in attempting to grant mercy even to the most wicked and too fearful of exposure. But in this case, mercy and fear must give way to justice. \n \n \nIt's a bit outside our discussion, but while we're out it, what's your beef with cannabilism?\n\n I don't want to be eaten.\n \n Perhaps you can tell me what is right and good about cannibalism? \n \n What about your view of pedophilia and prostitution?",

   "Jito,\n \nI will hunt around. I forgot where I read the article. It may have been in the Minneapolis paper. The crux was a woman in Italy chose to go through with her pregnancy even though she knew in advance it will kill her.\n \n \n \"The Vatican has long championed the case of Gianna Beretta Molla, an Italian paediatrician who died in 1962 at the age of 39 - a week after giving birth to her fourth child.\" She postponed treatment for cancer so it wouldn't harm her baby.\n \n You are right in saying the \"crux\" (that is, cross) was that a woman chose to go through with her pregnancy even though she knew in advance that it would kill her. The pope recognized this woman's total dedication to her family and to her Christianity. She gave her life for another just as Jesus did. Just as Jesus told us to do when he said, \"No greater love hath a man than to give his life for another.\"\n \n The pope would expect nothing less of a man. Read Ephesians 5 and you will find what is expected of a Christian husband...that he love his wife as Christ loved the Church...and we know how Christ showed his love for his Church.\n \n \nRecognition is one thing. Making her a saint sends a very strong message and I don't believe that his motives aren't political.\n\n I think that the pope's message was religious not political. \n \n Whether it was political or religious I'm still not sure how it warrants your compliments to the saint but your condemnation of the pope. \n \n \nWhatever. I use it. I will be getting my tubes tied. And I will never marry again. \n \n The more control I have taken in my life the happier and more successful I am. I learn every day how strong I am. How capable I am. How much I can do. And I only really started learning that as I took control. ME.\n\n It sounds like you endured a bad experience with marriage.\n \n You have learned how strong and in control you are. How would you instill this strength and control in your kids (if you have any or will have any)? Would you convey to them that they posses an inherent dignity, worth, and respect?...perhaps the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and happiness? Rights that can be taken away by no man? Rights endowed by a Creator?\n \n How would you do that if at some point you had to tell them that their worth was expendable? Expendable to the pursuance of \"choice?\" How does one look her child in the eye and tell him he is loved unconditionally and that he has a unique worth yet all of this is dependent on your decision? All of this can be sacrificed to the ideal of \"choice?\" It grants unlimited power to some while robbing others of any power.\n \n \nYou and the Pope can bite me.\n\n I regretfully decline. Sigma likes cannibalism though. You might extend the offer to her.\n \n \n \nFrom what? You really think mankind was oh so innocent before 1930? Get a clue. People aren't immoral suddenly because they want to control how many kids they have.\n\n I think contraception has made it worse, not better.\n \n \nOh, you mean like back when it was still legal to beat your wife and sell your daughter off in marriage to a man she didn't love.\n \n I don't think the Church would approve of either of those practices.\n \n Did you see the recent warning from the Vatican on marrying Muslims--a warning that went out particularly to women?\n \n You can read about it here:\n \n http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/nm/20040514/ts_nm/pope_muslims_dc \n \n \nI wish the Pope would consider third world countries. In particular Latin America. His influence is huge and the damage he does is inexcusable.\n\n His influence is immense and he conveys the Christian message...that marriage is sacred and children are blessings. Did you read any of the articles I provided that tell of the pope's advocacy for women?\n \n \n \nHA! Why doesn't he come out and say what he really means \"Contraception would mislead WOMEN into thinking they had unlimited dominion over their own bodies\" - \n \n He could have said that, as well as saying that men would feel they had unlimited dominion over women.\n \n \nUnlimited dominion over my body and choices is what I demand and expect. It's what men have. Women wanted it before contraception, which is why we are such avid customers now.\n\n A certain amount of dominion over one's body is acceptable. But unlimited dominion over another body in your body is not. Why seek power by making yourself a man? Why seek feminine rights by denying your feminine gifts?\n \n For if you have unlimited dominion over another than the state can have unlimited dominion of others as China has arranged. If yoiu believe that the right to life is not inalienable and is conferred to us by man rather than by a higher power then man can, at any time, take that right away.\n \n \n \nHis ideas about the reproductive functions of people in general tick me off. His influnce in Latin America is especially disturbing. He tells these people - no birth control, no control for women, no abortion - just keep pumping out those babies - - - and these people are in extreme poverty. I know this. My ex-husband is from there. I saw it with my own eyes. \n \n G.K. Chesterton wondered why the term \"birth control\" was chosen as a name for artificial contraception when its motive was to prevent birth and allow a loss of control. Abortion is also used as an escape from an act stemming from loss of control. The pope tells people that they should take control over their lives--abstinence before marriage and chastity within marriage. He doesn't say keep pumping out babies. He says have babies at the right time for everyone. He says respect babies and respect yourself. I'm not sure how that can be misconstrued as disturbing.\n \n \nHowever, I am not a Catholic - so thankfully I could care less what the Pope thinks.\n\n You seem to care quite a bit...so much so that it breeds hatred.",

   "Jito,\n \nI think the Pope sticking his grubby nose into strangers sex lives is inapropriate - period. Kind of sick actually. And that is what the Catholic Church's view on sexuality comes down to.\n\n The pope is a leader who is simply guiding his people. He is a messenger and his message is that of Jesus Christ. He's only spreading the word. The Church's view of sexuality is a very high one. I don't see the problem with teaching people that marriage and sex are important events to be taken seriously. The consequences of not adhering to this are evident as I have previously asserted to Sigma.\n \n \nIf you don't want use birth comtrol in your life - fine. Don't try and take it from those of us who do.\n\n I'm not trying to take your birth control. I'm stating that there are better options.\n \n \nI don't actually approve of abortion in most situations. However, I do not agree that strangers and government or better equipped to make important medical decisions for a woman than that woman herself.\n\n I am glad that you don't approve of abortion in most situations. I wish you would more boldly proclaim it though. There's nothing wrong with being against abortion and nothing wrong with professing it. There's a lot right about being against it. I don't really agree that abortion is a \"medical decision\" though.\n \n \n \nI do not believe that you can legislate responsibility.\n\n I believe you can. It is done all the time. I do not think it is the best approach but I do think its a valid one. \n \n \nI don't believe banning abortion will prevent abortion - but will actually lead back alley butcher jobs and more unwanted kids.\n\n I do believe banning abortion will prevent abortion.\n \n \nI believe birth control is a wonderful thing that will result in far less abortions and unwanted, unloved kids that all the Pope's pomp and circumstance.\n\n I think birth control can be a false sense of security. I think it creates a \"birth control\" mentality and when it fails abortion is often the next step.\n \n \nAnd finally - let me be clear. I am a mom. When my birth control failed while I was in college with no money, an abuser, and no possbility of seeing a doctor - I found a way. I been through hell and back rasing my son alone. He will never have to question what he means to me.\n\n I commend you for your guts and perseverance. Parenting is a very difficult job. Single parenthood seems extremely difficult. I think you did the right thing. I hope your son has brought you much joy and happiness. \n \n The Church is only teaching things that promote the family, things that make it easier for everyone involved. The Church's teachings are idealistic but they are also very practical. They sound good but they work well also. The Church teaches things that hopefully will allow people to avoid difficult situations like yours but when those situations occur the Church is still supportive. Don't you want to teach your son to embrace those things that will cause him less hardship and stress?",

Nor is there anything in Catholic teaching that says that. If you look at the Catholic Catechsim you will find its view of sexual intimacy:\n \n III. THE LOVE OF HUSBAND AND WIFE \n \n 2360 Sexuality is ordered to the conjugal love of man and woman. In marriage the physical intimacy of the spouses becomes a sign and pledge of spiritual communion. Marriage bonds between baptized persons are sanctified by the sacrament. \n \n 2361 \"Sexuality, by means of which man and woman give themselves to one another through the acts which are proper and exclusive to spouses, is not something simply biological, but concerns the innermost being of the human person as such. It is realized in a truly human way only if it is an integral part of the love by which a man and woman commit themselves totally to one another until death.\"143 \n \n 2362 \"The acts in marriage by which the intimate and chaste union of the spouses takes place are noble and honorable; the truly human performance of these acts fosters the self-giving they signify and enriches the spouses in joy and gratitude.\"145 Sexuality is a source of joy and pleasure: \n \n The Creator himself . . . established that in the [generative] function, spouses should experience pleasure and enjoyment  of body and spirit. Therefore, the spouses do nothing evil in seeking this pleasure and enjoyment. They accept what the Creator has intended for them. At the same time, spouses should know how to keep themselves within the limits of just moderation.146 \n \n 2363 The spouses' union achieves the twofold end of marriage: the good of the spouses themselves and the transmission of life. These two meanings or values of marriage cannot be separated without altering the couple's spiritual life and compromising the goods of marriage and the future of the family. \n \n The conjugal love of man and woman thus stands under the twofold obligation of fidelity and fecundity. \n (emphasis mine)\n \n \nUm - no. People aren't gonna be abstinent. They just aren't. A whole lot of people aren't. The majority of them. Birth control is BEST way to avoid unwanted pregnancy and abortion - primarily because it is REALISTIC. Just say no to sex - isn't gonna work. I promise you.\n\n You are engendering a self-fulfilling prophecy when you say things like that and when you teach your kids in that way. Kids can and do remain abstinent if their parents teach them in a way that shows them it is a valuable endeavor. Abstinence is on the rise.\n \n Kids will not be abstinent even in Christian homes if love and sex are put under the rug and not talked about--I know several examples of good, Christian parents assuming their kids would do the right thing without any teaching on their part. Kids will not be abstinent if we are casual in our approach to sex and offer only a few words of advice. They definitely will not be abstinent if we doom them to fail by telling them that everyone does it, that they are too animalistic to control themselves, that they can have all of these so called safeguards to allow them meaningless sex supposedly without consequence.\n \n Do you believe in love? Why not teach your kids that the highest form of love that they can have for their future spouse is to start loving them before they ever meat them. To save themselves in full and total dedication so as to express the truest and most pure love possible. Then teach them the hazards of not being abstinent. Didn't you say your contraception failed?\n \n \n \nI have no fear stating my opinion. Just because I may disgaree with most abortions does not mean I want to start taking away a woman's right to choose. Let me be clear - I am pro-choice.\n\n So is it fair to say that you believe a woman's right to choose is a higher ideal than a baby's right to life?\n \n \nNope. Just the safe ones with with those unconfortable statistics you have to see. All the ones in the future will be in secret and unsafe. But as long as your sensibilities aren't offended....\n\n As I told Sigma, I seriously doubt that banning abortion will result in the death of 4,000 mothers a day (as is the daily average of abortions).\n \n \nNo they are not practical. Not only that - I would say it's teachings around sex are down right unhealthy. There is no biblical reason priests can't marry. I am convinced it's why there has been a history of abuse.\n\n Christ gave everything even his life. The priest is doing the same. He is renouncing everything in this world to show us that there is more in the next. He is a true model of Christ, sacrificing his entire self. \n \n I think that celibacy has nothing to do with the current abuse scandal. Ask the heterosexual males you know (married or single) this question: \"If, for\n some reason, you could never have sex again, ever, in your entire life with a woman would this make you inclined to abuse or seek intimacy with a male child or teenager?\" I would answer a definite no and I think most would. This abuse is deviant behavior.\n \n \nI will not teach my son the Catholic church's view on sex - a dirty little back secret that had better not be enjoyed. Our sexuality is part of who we are as human beings. We should indeed be responsible with it. But what the Catholic church teaches is ludricous.\n\n Please refer to the above Catechism quote and see if you still think it is a ludicrous view.

Abstinence is on the rise.\n\n \n There you go talking about sex like it is bad thing again. We are sexual. It is utterly natural to engage in sex. Yes it should be taken seriously, and done responsibly, but people, adults are not going to be abstinate unless they want babies. I am not talking kids here - I am talking about grown ups. I assure you, I intend to have no more children - have my tubes tied.

Knowledge is the most powerful tool we have. No matter what the topic. However, I also intend for my son to understand what birth control is and does. When he is kid/teen I fully hope him to not be sexually active and will tell him so. I am however, also going to make sure he knows about birth control in case he is not. I can't force him not to be. The more he knows and the better equipped he is - the better - and that includes knowing about birth control.\n \n Why do you say birth control is a false sense of security? When used properly it is nearly than 100% effective. A lot more effective \"let's cross our fingers that they won't have sex\" plan you have in mind.\n \n \nDo you believe in love? \n\n \n No, not really. Did I ever mention my abusive, walked on his kid ex (who I actually was married to) was a pro-life Catholic?\n \n \nWhy not teach your kids that the highest form of love that they can have for their future spouse is to start loving them before they ever meat them.

And lions might talk, just like in The Lion King. \n \n Of course I want him to know love.

Didn't you say your contraception failed?\n\n \n Absolutely I will. But I will also teach him that if he chooses to engage in sex there options for protection.\n \n \nSo is it fair to say that you believe a woman's right to choose is a higher ideal than a baby's right to life?\n\n \n As long as it relies on my body - yes. \n \n \nChrist gave everything even his life.

He is a true model of Christ, sacrificing his entire self. \n\n \n Yes - but he could have married. Who knows? - maybe he even did. It was fully unsinful for Jewish men (even their priests) to marry. Expected, actually. Do I actually think he was married? Probably not. Granted a lot of wives were left out of the Bible, I think...but I suspect his would not have been. However, if would be just fine if he were.\n \n \nI think that celibacy has nothing to do with the current abuse scandal.

   "I've heard that lame argument so many times that there must be some anti-Catholic website that publishes lists of things to say to put down Catholicism?\n \n I'll give you the standard Catholic reply to the standard anti-Catholic statement: Catholics ask saints, Mary, etc., to INTERCEDE on their behalf. There is a big difference.\n\n \n A prayer is an act of worship. Furthermore the Bible says quite plainly that the onlly way to God is through Christ, not a group of historical people in the Bible/church. Through Christ and Christ alone.\n \n \nWould you knowingly fly in a plane that landed safely \"nearly\" 100% of the time? :) \n\n \n Maybe you have not noticed that planes do occasionally crash. Anyone who does fly takes the chance that it's not 100% that the plane will come down safely. Those stats are even higher every time you get in your car. Everything involves risk - you determine how much you want to assume and take what precautions you want (i.e., safety belts).\n \n Now I know that no sex is the most effective way to not get pregnant. I think everyone knows that. However, should one engage in sex, using birth control will make it less likely than using none. That's not my imagination - it's fact.\n \n Duh.\n \n \nI find it amazing that even after reading Maximus' direct quotes on sex from Catholic Catechism that contradict your assertion, you chose to continue to make false claims. I could care less whether you like the Pope or Catholicism, but at least have the guts to admit that you were WRONG in your assertions.\n\n \n Disagreeing with Catholic dogma does not make me wrong. I think he is. That's really what I think. The only thing I need to admit to is that we disagree.\n \n The catechism may say one thing - \"the no birth control\" - rule says more. No birth control equals a high risk of pregnancy - which implies most heavily that sex is for pro-creation only - engaging in it for any other reason is off limits.\n \n \nEver read the story of Sodom and Gomorrha? Lots of consentual sex there...and some attempted non-consentual sex.\n emoticon_ic\n\n \n Yep. Along with the rest of the Hebrew scriptures/Old Testament. Have you read other parts of the Bible?\n \n I stand by my earlier statement that the limitations about sex in Bible are on who can engage in it - nothing more. \n \n For the record - my recognizing what is the Bible, and applying to my life - does not mean I agree that it should be force applied to anyone else through law.\n \n People need to choose on their own to follow God's law. To force them secularly is a lie. It is meaningless to God. Our secular laws need to be seperated from faith.",

   "Jito,\n \nAnd there are plenty of things in Catholic dogma that have nothing to with Christianity or what's in the Bible. As a matter of fact - there are things that I am aware of that are completlely unbiblical - starting with the one thing that ticks God off the most - worshipping somebody besides Him - and Catholics do. (Mary, saints, etc.)\n\n Catholics do not worship Mary or the saints. See this post and it will explain why we honor her although this should not have to be explained to any Christian:\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=39497&highlight=mary#post39497 \n \n Scroll down to \"Catholic Veneration of Mary\"\n \n \nAbortion, yes. But ontraception, no.\n\n 1. If you adhere to the Bible and there are implied negative references to abortion then why do you defend it?\n \n 2. What do you think of the Onan incident in Genesis 38:8-10? What Onan did was a form of contraception and it was displeasing to God.\n \n \nI don't care what the catechism says. The \"no birth control\" rules say it all.\n \n You might care what the Catechism says if you were truly attempting to understand Catholic teaching and not project what you think to be Catholic teaching. The no contraception rule says a lot but it does not say anything bad.\n \n \nThe above quote is my point. There is nothing to back this up in the Bible. A (married) couple can play every night if they want.\n\n Yes, they can, if they do not deny the procreative aspect of that play. Fertility in the Bible is always a blessing, never a curse.\n \n \nThere you go talking about sex like it is bad thing again. We are sexual. It is utterly natural to engage in sex. Yes it should be taken seriously, and done responsibly, but people, adults are not going to be abstinate unless they want babies. I am not talking kids here - I am talking about grown ups. I assure you, I intend to have no more children - have my tubes tied. If I ever marry again - I fully intend to have sex. \n \n I don't think any of my words to which you responded indicated sex was a bad thing. Many of my statements have indicated that sex outside of marriage is a bad thing--that is quite obvious to anyone because the results are bad.\n \n I don't know why adults can't be adults and remain abstinate if they don't want to take responsibility for their actions. What other urges do you indulge without restraint or consequence?\n \n \n I agree with you here. Knowledge is the most powerful tool we have. No matter what the topic. However, I also intend for my son to understand what birth control is and does. When he is kid/teen I fully hope him to not be sexually active and will tell him so. I am however, also going to make sure he knows about birth control in case he is not. I can't force him not to be. The more he knows and the better equipped he is - the better - and that includes knowing about birth control.\n \n \nWhy do you say birth control is a false sense of security? When used properly it is nearly than 100% effective. A lot more effective \"let's cross our fingers that they won't have sex\" plan you have in mind.\n\n Did it work for you? Does it protect from venereal diseases? Does it protect from the emotional loss you feel when someone leaves you after experiencing a very intimate physical encounter? My plan is not a \"let's cross our fingers that they won't have sex\" plan. The Catholic teaching is one that places proper value on sex, human relationships, and people.\n \n \nNo, not really. Did I ever mention my abusive, walked on his kid ex (who I actually was married to) was a pro-life Catholic?\n\n I am sorry that you do not believe in love. I'm am sorry that you were abused. But this person's sinfulness does not mar the Catholic Church because he was not living up to being a faithful Catholic. He was not very pro-life if he was abusing the life of a woman and child. I hope you can someday get past that pain.\n \n \nHa ha. And lions might talk, just like in The Lion King. \n \n Of course I want him to know love. But I also want him to have control in his (and his partner's life) and enjoy that love (as in HAVE SEX) while still determining all on their own, without the help of some old fart in Rome, when and whether or not to have children.\n\n Perhaps this is what distinguishes your view from that of the Church (my view). The Church's view is inherently and unwaveringly optimistic. It is a view that God might have. The Church's optimism has always appealed to me.\n \n \nAre you aware of all the sex that actually happens in the Bible? Old testament couples caught messing around? It's everywhere. There is nothing wrong with a whole lot of sex - the limitations are to who engages in it - not to how much you can have.\n\n Amen. Does the Bible lead you to believe that anyone engaged in contraception or abortion? If so was it looked upon favorably? Does the Bible seem to create a context that is hostile to the fruit of sex--children--or does it seem to create a context that is embracing of children?",

Do you think he was trying to get to God through others? He was an apostle and his writings are part of Holy Scripture. \n \n \nThe catechism may say one thing - \"the no birth control\" - rule says more. No birth control equals a high risk of pregnancy - which implies most heavily that sex is for pro-creation only - engaging in it for any other reason is off limits.\n\n The Church teaches that sex has two purposes: a unitive aspect to foster love and fidelity between spouses and a procreative aspect to bear children. One cannot deny either aspect. This is why the Church also opposes in vitro fertilization--it eliminates the unitive act of sex. If the Church was attempting to overpopulate the world with Catholics then it has better means at its disposal than simply denying contraception.\n \n \"No contraception\" does not equal a high risk of pregnancy when one follows the comprehensive Church teaching instead of focusing on one aspect of it.\n \n By the way, I think you fall into the category that my signature quote of Bishop Sheen describes...you hate what you think  is the Catholic Church.",

I believe most reasonable people would agree with me.\n \n \n\n I'll bet you that the development of the fetus at 3 months (or whatever stage) is not given in any detail. I venture to say that the doctor, who benefits by her having the abortion, does not go out of his way to fill her in completely, he is going to prey upon her \"desperation\" and state of mind\n\n \n How in the world do doctors benefit from an abortion? Are you saying that doctors would deliberatly do not give information they are asked for? If this occurs, you should report that doctor. Abortion is not to be blamed for this, the doctor is supposed to give any and all medical information if asked (as I understand it).\n \n If you are trying to say that PP is price gouging and preying on fears to force women into abortion, I think you're flat wrong. PP is required to give all options and not try to influence a woman either way, but encourage the woman to talk with those she trusts. Also, PP have a sliding scale, the less you are able to pay, the more help with paying you get. That doesn't sound like price gouging to me. You may not like what they do, but you have to admit that the people at PP are caring individuals who truly want what's best for their patients.\n \n You mean like HMOs not wanting doctors suggesting expensive procedures so that the insurance has to pay for it? I don't think the procedures are at fault for this, but our medical system in general.\n \n \n\n You misunderstood my point then. If the Liberals can \"force\" people to be registered voters, even though the information/process is available to them elsewhere, then why can't we force women to hear and see every detail about the fetus and procedure?\n\n \n I've never been forced to be a registered voter. I've tried to be registered, and have found it to be fairly difficult :P\n \n Your comparason is somewhat lacking, however. Does registering to vote cause emotional distress? Do \"liberals\" show up at their door and show bloody pictures if they don't register? I truly don't see how one necesitates the other.",

To think that the child is responsible for all of her problems is way off base.\n\n \n Whether or not a woman is unhappy with being pregnant has little to do with how the woman feels about the fetus per se. \n \n A woman cannot be unhappy with being pregnant?\n \n \n\n You mean I've reached quasi-philosophical status? That's more than I'd hoped for. Thanks, I'll take that as a compliment :)\n\n \n An exalted state ;)\n \n \n\n No I will not deny that pregnancy puts stress on the body. But it is stress that is a normal part of life and stress with a beneficial result--just like exercise stresses your heart and muscles, test-taking and studying stresses your mind, sex stresses your body, love sometimes stresses your emotions, etc.\n\n \n \"Normal part of life\"? You speak as if pregnancy is inevitable. It can be prevented and stopped before it becomes very stressful.\n \n \"beneficial result\" is a subjective concept. Some woman wouldn't view having a child as beneficial.\n \n None of those things you listed are mandated by law (with the arguable exception of test-taking, though learning is optional). Why should pregnancy, beneficial or not, be mandated by law?\n \n \n\n Mother and child are not a soup of organs and tissue without differentiation. A mother and child are distinct. \n\n \n Physically distinct? I disagree, I believe they are not distinct and separate until the cord is cut or the placenta is birthed.\n \n \n\n In this you are correct. There is no border for the mother to transmit life sustaining necessities. But she is transmitting them to another distinct body.\n\n \n Then we agree? No borders between them :) That seems to contradict your previous point of borders making them distinct. \n \n \n \n \n\n So the fetus is a living human being distinct from the mother (yet not physically separate) but it has no rights to survival?\n \n You say that the two are distinct entities but physically inseparable? Is that correct?\n \n Would you say that the fetus is an appendage that the mother may do with what she wishes?\n\n \n I believe you're misunderstanding my points. They are not distinct, and not physically separate (which would be part of them being physically distinct, would it not?). They are genetically distinct (making them different entities). Perhaps if you tell me what you would define as physically distinct, we can go from there.\n \n The fetus does fit part of the dictionary definition of appendage\n (ap\u00b7pend\u00b7age n. Something added or attached to an entity of greater importance or size; an adjunct. )\n However, I personally wouldn't call the fetus an appendage since what I would call an appendage would have a use to the entity that has that appendage. The fetus has no use (in this sense).\n \n I do believe the woman who has to provide support to the entity growing inside of her with her own organs has full rights over that entity, including terminating it.",

Each entity has it's own distinct DNA. Each entity has it's own distinct set of cells. Each entity is completely self-contained within the physical borders of their individual bodies. They exist in a parasitic relationship, so yes, there is a physical connection. But they are physically distinct organisms.

The parasite needs the nourishment of the bodily fluids, but the fetus needs the mother's organs because its own do not function or function incompletely.\n \n A better analogy might come from a transformers show I saw a long time ago. A machine designed by the enemies (I forget what they were called) was attached to the leader of the good guys. This machine rerouted all of the good guy's life support processes into itself; separating them would kill the good guy. This analogy is limited because the mobile good guy was the one dependent on the little machine, the little machine was created for a nefarious purpose and neither of those involved were made of flesh, but it does help outline the relationship. I would not consider the two physically distinct anymore. Simply being attached isn't enough, the fact that the intimate connection (all of the good guy's life was being supported by this little machine) was there makes the good guy no longer an independent organism. The little machine could presumably continue \"living\" without the good guy however.",

The two entities have their own bodies. Each is unique. Each is distinctly individual. The two physical distinct physical entities are in an intimate physical relationship that is unique to mammals.\n\n \n From your definition, I believe we were talking about different things. You speak of distinct as having it's own characteristics. I do agree with you.\n \n From what maximus was saying, I believed he was using \"physically distinct\" as being separate from the mother and that was how I was using it. I do not agree with that.\n \n When definitions are being discussed, it always comes down to word play. That is why our laws are so verbose; in an effort to be fair, the laws try to accomodate every shading of meaning, and still there is confusion on exactly what is allowed and what the law defines something as.\n \n When you say \"The two entities have their own bodies.\" what are you considering a \"body\". I'm really not trying to be cagey or picky, I actually do have a point. Is a body characterized by having a complete set of organs? A complete set of functioning organs? Depending on the stage of development, this changes. Even right before birth, not all of the fetus' organs are functioning correctly or at all. Part of the definition of a body is simply \"a human\". Is that how you are using it?\n \n When you say \"Each is distinctly individual.\", what is an individual? A unique genetic code? Independence? Part of the definition of individual is being separate. It is a stretch to call the two separate, in my opinion, even if we argue over whether each is physically distinct (I pretty much consider them one and the same. If they are not separate, I do not call them physically distinct).\n \n They are indeed in a relationship unique to mammals (bearing live young). The relationship is similar to a parasitic symbiotic relationship, only difference being that they are the same species.\n \n \n\n And a fetus is a complete organism unto itself. It cannot survive without the protection, nourishment & oxygen that it receives from the mother the same way any other living organism cannot survive in a hostile environment without nourishment and oxygen. The use of a particular organ is not necessary to define physical distinctness. An obviously absurd example: Is an individual not physically distinct from a life-support machine?\n\n \n The use of a particular organ might not define physical distinctness, but I believe the use of it's own organs should. A person who's organs have ceased functioning is different than an organism who's organs are not functioning completely yet. With the person on life-support, the division is between living and non-living, as well as a person's organs are supposed to work. It is similar to the species procreating concept. Individuals might not be able to procreate, but the species as a whole can, so they are defined as being able to even if individual members cannot. \n \n I'm very leery to get into a discussion where medical science is concerned, since it can destroy and make murky a lot of definitions. For example, is a clone an individual human since it's genetic code is not unique? With the advent of nano-technology, the line between living and non-living will blur as well (since nano-bots can be made of proteins). If you would be agreeable, I would like to keep what science can do out of the discussion unless it is directly applicable (like viability for example).\n \n A complete organism? So far, we've (or at least I've) been using the term \"fetus\" as a blanket term for a developing human. Obviously at the zygote and embyro stage there is little to no cell differentiation, and no organs to speak of, only the potential to grow those organs.\n \n Speaking for a late term fetus, what are you considering \"complete\"? I would not call it complete until its organs function as they will for the majority of its life (barring accidental death or disease). Before birth, organs such as the heart and lungs function in ways that are significantly different than they will when it is out of the womb and born. I do not believe comparing a hostile environment (such as space) that born humans were never designed to go to an environment that the fetus was designed to live in but is not developed enough to live in is valid. Apples and oranges.\n \n \n\n In order to make a case for there being no physical distinctions between a fetus and a mother, I would ask for your definition of physical distinction. I suspect that finding such a definition that fits your model may be difficult, but give it a go, if you desire. I think you'll agree, though, that by the definition I posed above, there is a physical distinction between the two entities.\n\n \n It is true that we should have agreed upon a definition earlier in the debate. A physically distinct entity would have to be independent of other entities for its bodily processes. By bodily processes I mean waste-management, oxygen circulation and other organ processes. \n \n I would be agreeable to use your definition, or we can use mine if you'd like. It might not be a complete definition covering all aspects and nuances of every living thing, but I believe it's adequate for humans in general and abortion in particular.",

So why should the baby loose it's life just because the mother isn't ready for a kid or just doesn't want the baby? It isn't right for these people to play god. They shouldn't be able to pick who lives and who dies. These people that doesn't want their baby are selfish. Has anybody ever heard of adoption?? At least the baby has a chance, has a chance of a good life instead of no life at all!!! \n \n\n \n Blue, perhaps you don't realize that pregnancy can be life-threatening for the woman? There are many medical problems associated with pregnancy, and sometimes a doctor will recommend an abortion either therapeutically or for a life-threatening problem.\n \n Here are some causes of medical abortion and some information on them (not meant to be comprehensive, there are many more conditions):\n \n Ectopic pregnancies\n An Ectopic pregnancy is when the fertilized egg implants itself into the fallopian tubes instead of the uterus. It can be detected early, and the only way to prevent hemorhaging is the cut that segment of the fallopian tube off which will of course kill the embryo. In the case of ectopic pregnancy there really is no other alternative. It's not like if you leave it alone the embryo will thrive; once it outgrows the tube the tube ruptures.Ectopic pregnancies cannot continue to term, so removal of the developing cells is necessary to save the life of the mother. \n \n Severe eclampsia, unresponsive to treatment. \n This occurs after 20 weeks. A woman will have very high blood pressure, seizures and kidney problems. Fortunately, not terribly common. The treatment is delivery of the fetus, which is tantamount to abortion since even with intensive care the survival at this age is remote.\n \n Rupture of the uterus. \n This is also a late-term medical problem which can also be the result of trauma. The fetus is terminated to prevent the woman from bleeding to death. If it occurs during labor, both may be saved, but not if it happens too early. The treatment is a hysterectomy.\n \n Other medical problems can also either induce abortion or worsen because of the pregnancy, especially heart conditions. Chemotherapy and radiation can induce abortion or fetal deformities. Heart conditions may worsen as pregnancy continues, and could be life-threatening. \n \n Therapeutic abortions are also recommended for certain women. Active tuberculosis, severe diabetes, renal failure, severe hypertension, acute hepatitis, acute pancreatitis,uterine bleedings,malignancy of breast or genital tract,threatened insanity,toxemia of pregnancy and other conditions as well.\n \n None are extremely common, but they aren't all that rare either. These are tough decisions to make, but I do not believe women are less moral for making them. I would hope that a woman takes care of herself first. Banning abortion alltogether will result in more deaths to these conditions. Doctors need to be able to judgements, in collaboration with their patients, without being second-guessed by polititians and those who want to stick their noses into women's reproductive lives.",

In reality, there is no 'problem.'\n \n \nIs it \"normal\" to mandate a woman have a child by law?\n\n I don't believe anyone is advocating the mandation (is that a word?) of having children.

That is part of my point to maximus, that every woman views her pregnancy differently. He believes a woman should view her pregnancy a certain way, so I brought up that to a woman pregnancy could be a problem (in any number of ways), with the fetus being the source of her problem (not by it's actions as it cannot make any action directly, but simply by existing).

I am addressing your arguments in favor of abortion.\n \n What you say about being a Christian is true. Your obedience must be sincere and forced obedience is worthless. So I do not force my views on others. I argue them and attempt to show their worth. I argue the objectivity of faith and truth. But as far as religion acting as legislator that is another aspect of the argument. Legislation of moral issues (influenced by religion or not) has occurred and continues to occur throughout our country's history. But abortion proponents want to throw that out on this issue alone.\n \n But back to your words on imposing morality as a Christian. You have not said anywhere that I know of that you are against abortion but don't want to impose your morality on others. You have always argued FOR abortion on every post that I have seen. There is a difference. I don't believe Christian ideals and the philosophy of abortion can co-exist. I didn't write that last post to pass judgement but as something for Christians to really think about and consider. And although I think Jesus' giving up his life for others and saying \"there is no greater love that a man have than to give up his life for another\" should be sufficient proof against a Christian support of abortion I will provide a few other points. \n \n What do you think of Jesus throwing the tables and goods over in the temple and expelling the merchants with such vigor? What of his calling the Pharisees and Saducees hypocrites and condemning them to their face for wrongdoing? Was this \"imposing\" his morality or speaking the truth?\n \n Jesus always took action to proclaim what was right and just. I believe he wanted us to be active in proclaiming and acting in accordance with good, right morals. And I don't think he would have ever said that he wouldn't impose his morals on another. Although he was less likely to impose them in the sense of forcing you to believe them, he was very ready to impose them by revealing and proclaiming them. So in the end one was compelled to believe them due to a truth and undeniable wisdom that had never yet been seen on earth. His morals were the morals of all men. His morals were truth, justice, and a perfection of morality. But he put them out as a lamp post, not under a bushel basket. He did, in fact, impose them on everyone, by nailing them to a cross for everyone to see.\n \n (But there are plenty of arguments against abortion that may not be Christian in nature).",

Stopping the pregnancy, discontinuing the gestation, terminating the pregnancy, terminating the fetus, killing the fetus embryo or zygote, preventing implantation, birth control, etc. What is your point?\n \n \n\n I don't believe that a person can morally have an abortion. I believe in an objective foundation of morality.\n\n \n Your morals are cruel, forcing a woman to continue a pregnancy that will end in stillbirth or worse, killing the mother. You would be cruel to force these morals upon people who think differently and want no part of your morality, in my opinion.\n \n \n\n We are obviously not understanding one another on this tangent.\n\n \n Perhaps not.\n \n \n\n Two definitions. In both definitions distinctness is established. Mother and child are distinct before birth and after birth. I don't think birth is the distinguishing factor as I have posed the same question to you previously.\n\n \n What are your 2 definitions and at what times to they apply? Why do you need 2 definitions anyway?\n \n You did pose that question, and I answered you. The fetus changes physiologically and legally and perhaps mentally and emotionally but that is hard to measure objectively. Dependence and distinctivness would be under physiologically I suppose. Organs that did not function before or functioned incompletly now begin to function as they will for the rest of it's life (for the most part). It becomes a self-sufficient organism as it was not before birth.\n \n The fetus can change in the eyes of the mother in a myriad of ways once it is born. She can now hold the infant, etc.\n \n The woman also changes the moment of birth. Various hormones will no longer be in her bloodstream, there is no extra drain upon her resources in the form of a fetus. There could be psycological changes, post partum depression, etc. So many things change or could change the moment of birth that it would take quite some time to list them all.\n \n Perhaps the most major change is this: Before birth the fetus was inside and attached, after birth it is neither of those things. Before birth the woman had a living entity inside of her and living off of her organs, after birth she does not.\n \n \n\n And when she cuts off her own portion then what does it do? Does it kill another living human being? If so, then is it her own?\n\n \n If it is not her own, then who's is it? Has she ceded over her right to her body? Who now has the right to it? Apparently, according to you, the fetus has the right, superior to the woman's right since its right is backed by the gov't while the woman's is not.\n \n What is with all this consenting to become a donor about? Why aren't healthy people with 2 kidneys being required to come in and donate? Forced to donate blood? \n \n People should have the legal rights to their own bodies, maximus, even if by doing so they kill another. Perhaps I am morally reprehensible for not donating my marrow to my brother even if I accidently caused his condition(hypothetical situation) but no one would dispute my right to do so no matter my reason, even if it kills him. I do not understand why you don't believe this.\n \n \n\n What do you mean by \"without consent or desire?\" Or you saying that the fetus is living off of her without consent? If so, then we have covered the mother's giving consent when she engages in activities known to result in the production of a child.\n\n \n Consenting to sex is not consenting to becoming pregnant. Consenting to sex is consenting to sex, no more. Removing her rights because a woman has sex is barbaric and amoral, in my opinion. Pregnancy and motherhood should not be used as a punishment for sex.\n \n \n\n Although my view of personhood does not rest on a legal construct, if our country can make up a legal construct of personhood, then there is no reason it cannot make up a legal construct of personhood for a fetus, as it is already doing with fetal protection laws.\n\n \n Of course there can be a legal construct of personhood for the fetus. This is what you are arguing for, and what I am arguing against. I do not deny that we could legally consider it a person, I simply am saying that it isn't legally considered a person.\n \n \n\n I do not look upon mother and child in terms of ownership.\n\n \n When you are arguing legal rights to the body, you sorta have to. What of the body is considered the 'woman' and what part the 'fetus'? \n \n Does the woman have the legal right to any part, or is it all now legally outside of her jurisdiction (since an impact on her system will have an affect on the newly created person, who has all the protection of the law)? How will miscarriages be investigated to make sure the woman didn't violate the law and eat herbs that caused it? How invasive are they allowed to be? Since her rights are being disregarded with regard to the fetus, will they need her permission to examine her? Since you don't subscribe to the \"my body my right\" argument, they should not need her permission, merely a search warrant.\n \n \n\n I would probably say that they are 2 physical entities in the same proximity.\n\n \n \"in the same proximity\"? Now who's using euphamisms :P That's akin to saying the voice in my head is in the same proximity.",

   "But back to your words on imposing morality as a Christian. You have not said anywhere that I know of that you are against abortion but don't want to impose your morality on others. You have always argued FOR abortion on every post that I have seen. There is a difference. I don't believe Christian ideals and the philosophy of abortion can co-exist. \n\n \n I do despise people using abortion irresponsibly. But let me be clear - I absoultely without a doubt want abortion safe and legal and the choice being left up to the woman.\n \n Pregnancy is a really big deal - I mean, HUGE. No matter what - the consequences will be tremendous. I am not going to make a decision like that for anybody else. How absolutely arrogant to even try!\n \n One must consider:\n \n Will this pregnancy hurt her? Kill her? If preganacy is a risk does she have other children? Does she have a mental illness or learning disability that would make going through a pregnancy impossible? What about meds? Is she on some that would hurt the fetus? If so, would it hurt her or kill her to be off of them? Is her body and/or mind mature enough to handle a pregnancy? Is she an addict (could she stay clean)? Is she in abusive relationship? Is she undergoing chemotherapy? Was she raped? Is she a child? Does she have AIDS or some other disease that could transmitted to the baby? Does she have the resources to get medical care? Will she have a healthy pregnancy? What is her stress level (yes this can impact the health of a fetus)?\n \n These are just a few things to consider. People's lives and situations are complex. There can be no way of knowing what is best for them all. Let them decide that themselves. I don't understand why anyone would want the responsibilty of making this choice for another. Have you considered the damage that might be done? Are you absolutely sure you want that burden? \n \n Look at your wives, sisters and daughters and ask yourselves if you really want their lives and bodies and choices in the hands of strangers.\n \n I am not pro-abortion. I am pro-choice. The difference is HUGE. If you can't even see that, then we have nothing to talk about, for you have no respect of where I am coming from. I understand why people are pro-life. It is ending a life. Abortion is awful and sad. Do you understand why I want choice protected? Do you understand why a single mom who spent her whole life watching the women she loves fight for power while they were hurt (including herself) would fight so hard for that?

   "Blue, perhaps you don't realize that pregnancy can be life-threatening for the woman? There are many medical problems associated with pregnancy, and sometimes a doctor will recommend an abortion either therapeutically or for a life-threatening problem.\n \n Here are some causes of medical abortion and some information on them (not meant to be comprehensive, there are many more conditions):\n \n Ectopic pregnancies\n An Ectopic pregnancy is when the fertilized egg implants itself into the fallopian tubes instead of the uterus. It can be detected early, and the only way to prevent hemorhaging is the cut that segment of the fallopian tube off which will of course kill the embryo. In the case of ectopic pregnancy there really is no other alternative. It's not like if you leave it alone the embryo will thrive; once it outgrows the tube the tube ruptures.Ectopic pregnancies cannot continue to term, so removal of the developing cells is necessary to save the life of the mother. \n \n Severe eclampsia, unresponsive to treatment. \n This occurs after 20 weeks. A woman will have very high blood pressure, seizures and kidney problems. Fortunately, not terribly common. The treatment is delivery of the fetus, which is tantamount to abortion since even with intensive care the survival at this age is remote.\n \n Rupture of the uterus. \n This is also a late-term medical problem which can also be the result of trauma. The fetus is terminated to prevent the woman from bleeding to death. If it occurs during labor, both may be saved, but not if it happens too early. The treatment is a hysterectomy.\n \n Other medical problems can also either induce abortion or worsen because of the pregnancy, especially heart conditions. Chemotherapy and radiation can induce abortion or fetal deformities. Heart conditions may worsen as pregnancy continues, and could be life-threatening. \n \n Therapeutic abortions are also recommended for certain women. Active tuberculosis, severe diabetes, renal failure, severe hypertension, acute hepatitis, acute pancreatitis,uterine bleedings,malignancy of breast or genital tract,threatened insanity,toxemia of pregnancy and other conditions as well.\n \n None are extremely common, but they aren't all that rare either. These are tough decisions to make, but I do not believe women are less moral for making them. I would hope that a woman takes care of herself first. Banning abortion alltogether will result in more deaths to these conditions. Doctors need to be able to judgements, in collaboration with their patients, without being second-guessed by polititians and those who want to stick their noses into women's reproductive lives.\n\n \n \n \n I can understand medical reasons!! But most people have abortions because their not ready for a kid or they dont want it and I think that is wrong! I can understand medical reasons because sometimes things happen that you have no control over. But people that have a choice and just don't care that's what bothers me. Do you know what they do to the babies? They suck them out of the mother with a thing that's like a vaccum but is like 5 times strong then a vaccum. Just think what that does to a baby that is not all the way devopled..... it tears the fetus into peices. Why would anybody want to do that to their baby?? Blue",

Before you said:\n \nI don't think abortion is right anytime! \n\n \n But now you say that medical reasons are ok? I don't believe that people \"just don't care\". I have read many accounts and talked to several women who have had abortions and all care deeply about what they felt they had to do. They were upset about it, often for much time afterwards (not regretting that they had done it, but upset that they felt it needed to be done for whatever reason). Some do regret it, but in almost all of those cases the woman felt that she had been coerced into it (which is illegal and, in my opinion, amoral. The woman who is pregnant should make the choice).\n \n As to the reasons they do it, it sometimes is as you say. They do not feel they are ready for a kid. Can you honestly say that feeling you are not ready for a kid is wrong? If a woman feels she cannot physically, emotionally, mentally or financially handle a pregnancy or a child, I believe it is cruel to shrug, smile and say \"Hey, that's just life babe\". It says to me that one cares nothing for women, only that one sees a wrong and goes for the easiest route to change it, no matter if you have to reduce women's rights to be inferior to what she is carrying to do so.\n \n You say:\n \nIt isn't right for these people to play god. They shouldn't be able to pick who lives and who dies. These people that doesn't want their baby are selfish.\n\n \n Yet, that is what you wish to do. You decide whether the fetus lives or not, you decide whether the woman's medical condition worsens even if it doesn't kill her, you decide what she does with her body. Shouldn't she decide what to do with her body, even if it is to withdraw organ support she does not wish to be a part of? Why are you more qualified to decide things for her body?\n \n Is being selfish a crime?\n \n \nDo you know what they do to the babies?

Just think what that does to a baby that is not all the way devopled..... it tears the fetus into peices. Why would anybody want to do that to their baby?? \n\n \n Is it merely the method that disturbs you? They try to make it as easy on the woman as possible, and I believe she is of paramount importance in the parasitic symbiotic relationship that is pregnancy. Yes, it does kill the fetus. There is no other way to separate the two, since the fetus is totally dependent on the mother's organs to survive. If there was a safe way to separate the two and allow both to live, that would probably be preferable to many women :)",

   "This is my argument against abortion.... This is not a matter of opinion for me, but a black and white moral issue. So...here we go.\n \n \n For this argument, the definition of abortion is the killing of a person inside the womb. A person is defined as someone who has the ability to reason, or who will one day have the ability to reason. \n \n 1. It is wrong (immoral) to kill an innocent person.\n 2. It is not moral or immoral to kill human tissue (such as an amputation, removal of a tumor, fetal material before it becomes a \"person\", etc).\n \n There are three options for a fetus:\n \n 1. It is always a person, and never just \"human tissue\", and thus it would always be wrong to kill it.\n 2. It is always human tissue, and never becomes a human, and thus you can kill it any time. This is impossible since every person originates as a fetus, and eventually becomes a person...otherwise mothers could kill their five year old children, since they are still only human tissue.\n 3. It originates at human tissue and at some specific point in time becomes a person. \n \n Most pro-choice people will agree with #3. The problem with this is that there is no clearly defined point at which the human tissue becomes a person. Since I define a \"person\" as someone who has the ability to reason, or who will one day have the ability to reason, then from the instant of conception, they are a person, since the fertilized egg will eventually become a reasoning person. \n \n IF the fertilized egg is not yet a person, then there MUST be some point where it becomes a person. In order for abortion to be moral (and not the killing of a person), then you must perform the procedure before the human tissue becomes a person. What point is this? I do not know, nor do I think this point can be proven. Viability? The age of viability is different for every fetus. You cannot guess at viability...but I guess viability for babies who are aborted is practically zero... When the heart beats? What is the heart is unable to beat by itself because of defect, but the baby would otherwise survive? If you are pro-abortion, then you must know the magic point...otherwise you are potentially killing innocent people...which I hope we all agree is wrong. \n \n If you assume that the moment of conception is the point at which human tissue becomes a person, you will never accidentally kill a person. I want to be a moral person. If there is a such a magic point...and it is not at conception...then please alert me to it, because prior to this moment, abortion is (by this argument) morally okay. But to kill an innocent person is wrong...no matter what the circumstances, and would not be a risk I would be willing to take. \n \n Is abortion wrong to me? Yes. Is abortion wrong for women?

Also, defining it this way already negates one of your options below, so it seems to me it's pointless to put down both.\n \n \n\n 1. It is wrong (immoral) to kill an innocent person.\n\n \n Really? According to whom?\n \n What is an innocent person? Is it wrong (immoral) to kill a guilty person?\n \n \n\n 2. It is not moral or immoral to kill human tissue (such as an amputation, removal of a tumor, fetal material before it becomes a \"person\", etc).\n\n \n Is it really? According to whom?\n \n \n\n There are three options for a fetus:\n\n \n The fetus has no options. It cannot choose between things, it has no concept of choice. It is subject to our choices, whether to allow it to live or not.\n \n \n\n 1. It is always a person, and never just \"human tissue\", and thus it would always be wrong to kill it.\n 2. It is always human tissue, and never becomes a human, and thus you can kill it any time. This is impossible since every person originates as a fetus, and eventually becomes a person...otherwise mothers could kill their five year old children, since they are still only human tissue.\n 3. It originates at human tissue and at some specific point in time becomes a person. \n\n \n It is always human tissue and human. Whether or not we consider it a person does not change the fact that it is composed of human tissue and is human. This does not mean that I may kill you, even if you are composed of human tissue. I am not sure why you make this distinction. Also, while it is true that every person was a fetus, not every fetus will eventually become a person. Your first 2 options are not mutually exclusive, and so cannot be chosen between. Your 3rd option is the only clear choice. \n \n Since sperm and egg can also be considered human tissue (Not technically, but neither is a single-celled zygote technically human tissue since tissue is multi-cellular), you can say that at conception it becomes a person and still be within option 3. Similarly, you can say that it becomes a person at birth and still be within option 3. So, I believe option 3 is the only option we can go with.\n \n \n\n Most pro-choice people will agree with #3. The problem with this is that there is no clearly defined point at which the human tissue becomes a person. Since I define a \"person\" as someone who has the ability to reason, or who will one day have the ability to reason, then from the instant of conception, they are a person, since the fertilized egg will eventually become a reasoning person. \n\n \n Most pro-life would have to agree with #3 as well. It originates from human tissue and at some point becomes a person. All that remains is to decide where that point is. Since your definition disregards retarded people as people, as well as those in comas, and possibly includes sperm and eggs as people (since the egg and sperm's destiny could be reasoning in the future, same as a fetus', can we exclude them?), I cannot accept your definition. \n \n What is wrong with the current definition, that we need a new one? Shouldn't the argument be where to apply the definition, instead of making up new ones to make your point? Making up a new definition serves no purpose and doesn't address the underlying issue, that we disagree whether to consider it a person at all.\n \n \n\n IF the fertilized egg is not yet a person, then there MUST be some point where it becomes a person. In order for abortion to be moral (and not the killing of a person), then you must perform the procedure before the human tissue becomes a person. What point is this?

If you are pro-abortion, then you must know the magic point...otherwise you are potentially killing innocent people...which I hope we all agree is wrong. \n\n \n Abortion can be moral to people. That it is not moral to you is irrelevent to people who it is moral to.\n \n Your sentence should read \"In order for abortion to be legal (and not the killing of a person)...\" You are right, that the point that a fetus becomes a person cannot be proven, because it is not a biologic point. It is a legal point. It is a human constructed point where we consider it a person under the law. You are right that viability changes, so that is not a stable point to anchor it to. Conception is often not known, so I do not believe that is a stable point either. The only point that is of sound logic (to me) is birth, partly because that is an easy point to determine (and also hard to miss ;) ).\n \n I am not \"pro-abortion\", but I will say that I do not believe that there is a \"magic point\", only a human constructed one. I believe that point should be birth. I'm not sure where you are getting this \"innocent person\" concept from. Innocent of what?\n \n \n\n If you assume that the moment of conception is the point at which human tissue becomes a person, you will never accidentally kill a person. I want to be a moral person. If there is a such a magic point...and it is not at conception...then please alert me to it, because prior to this moment, abortion is (by this argument) morally okay. But to kill an innocent person is wrong...no matter what the circumstances, and would not be a risk I would be willing to take. \n\n \n You can still accidently kill the fetus even if it is a person. No legislation can protect against accidents. Similarly, no legislation will change the fact that about 1/3 of all pregnancies end in miscarriage, often before the woman knows she is pregnant. I suppose these will be ruled \"natural deaths\", but how will investigations be handled to make sure? How will the woman be charged if something she did contributed to it's death, if she wasn't aware it existed? \"Involuntary Manslaughter\"? If she didn't know, she can't report it to the police. Is she morally a murderer, even if she did not know she was pregnant and so couldn't report it? I suppose women should wear devices so the police know immediately when a woman is pregnant. Or perhaps they should all report to a facility when they are due to ovulate so they can be checked for little people inside them.\n \n \n and would not be a risk I would be willing to take.\n\n \n It's a good thing that it isn't then :) It is the woman who is pregant who takes the risk.\n \n \n\n Is abortion wrong to me? Yes. Is abortion wrong for women? Unless they are certain of the instant a fetus becomes a person, and do the procedure prior to that moment, yes.\n\n \n That is certainly a valid view, as valid as anyone's. However, a woman who believes she has the moral right to have an abortion also has a view that is as valid as yours. The law has determined the point that a fetus becomes a person, so all one needs is knowledge of the law to make that determination. If a woman decides it is a person beforehand and does not abort, she should not be forced to abort for someone elses morals :) \n \n However, neither should she be forced to carry a fetus to term for someone elses morals, either. I would view both as equally corrupt.",

The only choices during pregnancy are whether to continue it or not to continue it (in terms of the debate; obviously there are more choices such as what to eat and so on).\n \n Whether or not a woman can afford a child is an important consideration. However, she also has to consider whether or not she can afford the pregnancy. She must take time off of work, she will not be as physically able to do many things. \n \n Financial considerations are only one thing that has to be considered. If she is emotionally fragile, such as in the depth of chronic depression or a psycological problem she is being treated for, a pregnancy can seriously undermine her emotional wellbeing. Hormonal imbalances can cause even a stable person to be very out of wack. Some women may not be able to deal with a pregnancy during that time. I do not believe we are morally able to force her, let alone legally.\n \n If a woman, or a girl in this case, is underage, she may not feel mentally prepared to go through a pregnancy or carry the child. She may fear verbal abuse at home for becoming pregnant, or from her boyfriend. She may be mentally unstable or mentally retarded, and may not feel that she can mentally handle the stress of carrying a fetus or raising a child. I do not feel we can morally force a woman or girl to carry a pregnancy to term.\n \n Physical considerations go farther than life-threatening. Some conditions would simply worsen with pregnancy, such as heart conditions, without directly threatening her life. Physical abuse from families, from boyfriends perhaps, would also be a physical consideration. If she is in a situation that she cannot escape from, or does not feel she can escape from, and a pregnancy would make her position that much more worse, I do not feel we can morally force her to carry it.\n \n Financial considerations also go far beyond simply \"I cannot afford a child\". If a girl or woman is on financial aid to go to college, but cannot take as many or any units to care for herself she can be taken off financial aid. If she has no other means to support herself, where can she go? If she is turned out of the house for becoming pregnant, if she cannot work because she is pregnant, if if if. There are as many different situations as there are women to experience them. I do not believe we can sit here and judge that this woman or that is not justified in getting an abortion. I believe each woman must decide for herself whether getting an abortion is the right decision for her situation.\n \n You do not understand how woman can have an abortion. But the fact that you do not understand their reasons does not negate their reasons. The description seems barbaric to you. That is a valid view. I should note that if funding is cut off, then the techniques will not benefit from modern medicine and women will most likely die much more often. As it is, it is a very safe procedure, like any surgery (any surgery can sound barbaric, no matter what they are doing).",

   "I'm curious, why did you define person this way, when there is already a legal definition and this only muddies the water? Also, defining it this way already negates one of your options below, so it seems to me it's pointless to put down both.\n \n \n \n Really? According to whom?\n \n What is an innocent person? Is it wrong (immoral) to kill a guilty person?\n \n \n \n Is it really? According to whom?\n \n \n \n The fetus has no options. It cannot choose between things, it has no concept of choice. It is subject to our choices, whether to allow it to live or not.\n \n \n \n It is always human tissue and human. Whether or not we consider it a person does not change the fact that it is composed of human tissue and is human. This does not mean that I may kill you, even if you are composed of human tissue. I am not sure why you make this distinction. Also, while it is true that every person was a fetus, not every fetus will eventually become a person. Your first 2 options are not mutually exclusive, and so cannot be chosen between. Your 3rd option is the only clear choice. \n \n Since sperm and egg can also be considered human tissue (Not technically, but neither is a single-celled zygote technically human tissue since tissue is multi-cellular), you can say that at conception it becomes a person and still be within option 3. Similarly, you can say that it becomes a person at birth and still be within option 3. So, I believe option 3 is the only option we can go with.\n \n \n \n Most pro-life would have to agree with #3 as well. It originates from human tissue and at some point becomes a person. All that remains is to decide where that point is. Since your definition disregards retarded people as people, as well as those in comas, and possibly includes sperm and eggs as people (since the egg and sperm's destiny could be reasoning in the future, same as a fetus', can we exclude them?), I cannot accept your definition. \n \n What is wrong with the current definition, that we need a new one? Shouldn't the argument be where to apply the definition, instead of making up new ones to make your point? Making up a new definition serves no purpose and doesn't address the underlying issue, that we disagree whether to consider it a person at all.\n \n \n \n Abortion can be moral to people. That it is not moral to you is irrelevent to people who it is moral to.\n \n Your sentence should read \"In order for abortion to be legal (and not the killing of a person)...\" You are right, that the point that a fetus becomes a person cannot be proven, because it is not a biologic point. It is a legal point. It is a human constructed point where we consider it a person under the law. You are right that viability changes, so that is not a stable point to anchor it to. Conception is often not known, so I do not believe that is a stable point either. The only point that is of sound logic (to me) is birth, partly because that is an easy point to determine (and also hard to miss ;) ).\n \n I am not \"pro-abortion\", but I will say that I do not believe that there is a \"magic point\", only a human constructed one. I believe that point should be birth. I'm not sure where you are getting this \"innocent person\" concept from. Innocent of what?\n \n \n \n You can still accidently kill the fetus even if it is a person. No legislation can protect against accidents. Similarly, no legislation will change the fact that about 1/3 of all pregnancies end in miscarriage, often before the woman knows she is pregnant. I suppose these will be ruled \"natural deaths\", but how will investigations be handled to make sure? How will the woman be charged if something she did contributed to it's death, if she wasn't aware it existed? \"Involuntary Manslaughter\"? If she didn't know, she can't report it to the police. Is she morally a murderer, even if she did not know she was pregnant and so couldn't report it? I suppose women should wear devices so the police know immediately when a woman is pregnant. Or perhaps they should all report to a facility when they are due to ovulate so they can be checked for little people inside them.\n \n \n \n It's a good thing that it isn't then :) It is the woman who is pregant who takes the risk.\n \n \n \n That is certainly a valid view, as valid as anyone's. However, a woman who believes she has the moral right to have an abortion also has a view that is as valid as yours. The law has determined the point that a fetus becomes a person, so all one needs is knowledge of the law to make that determination. If a woman decides it is a person beforehand and does not abort, she should not be forced to abort for someone elses morals :) \n \n However, neither should she be forced to carry a fetus to term for someone elses morals, either. I would view both as equally corrupt.\nUsing my original argument...if you believe abortion is moral, then these are your only options:\n \n 1. You have found an error in my argument which would make it invalid. If this is the case, please let me know.\n 2. You know and can prove the point in which the human tissue becomes a baby, and only perform abortions prior to this moment.\n 3. You believe the murder of innocent people is moral.\n \n There are no other options. This debate is over the potential killing of innocent people. It should warrant thorough logical reasoning. Pro-choice and pro-life people alike go around saying \"I believe this...just because it is my opinion\" and have no other basis for their argument. You can not escape the laws of logic. 1 + 1 will always = 2. If you cannot find error in my argument, I do not see how you can logically support abortion. \n \n I believe that the laws of logic can prove abortion to be immoral. If there is another argument which proves it moral, then I will change my stance. I don't use the fact that the government says it is legal to be my reason, or the fact that the Bible says it is wrong. I use logic.\n \n Regarding empirical reasoning...the greatest amount of happiness is relative and therefore not a good way to judge morality. Deontological argument is much more effective, because you can prove things a priori (through contradiction). A priori logic (1+1=2) will always trump empirical logic. \n \n Take this argument for example: \n Women should be happy. Rape makes women sad. Being pregnant as a result makes them sadder. Killing the fetus will make them happier again, so abortion is moral. This is an empirical argument. \n On the same token: Sigma drives a nice car. Jaaaman does not. Nice cars make Jaaaman happy (as well as his wife ...), so it is not immoral for Jaaaman to steal Sigma's car. \n \n Using the greatest amount of happiness theory is probably the worst thing we could use when arguing morality, in my opinion. There are no absolutes, and by my above argument, stealing would be okay, when we can prove a priori using deontological argument that it is not.",

No matter what - the consequences will be tremendous. I am not going to make a decision like that for anybody else. How absolutely arrogant to even try!\n \n One must consider:\n \n Will this pregnancy hurt her? Kill her? If preganacy is a risk does she have other children? Does she have a mental illness or learning disability that would make going through a pregnancy impossible? What about meds? Is she on some that would hurt the fetus? If so, would it hurt her or kill her to be off of them? Is her body and/or mind mature enough to handle a pregnancy? Is she an addict (could she stay clean)? Is she in abusive relationship? Is she undergoing chemotherapy? Was she raped? Is she a child? Does she have AIDS or some other disease that could transmitted to the baby? Does she have the resources to get medical care? Will she have a healthy pregnancy? What is her stress level (yes this can impact the health of a fetus)?\n \n These are just a few things to consider. People's lives and situations are complex.

There can be problems with pregnancy, even life-threatening ones. But to blame it on the fetus is not just.\n \n \nIt doesn't bother you that all these people are dying?! Something has to be done! We should take it out of the hands of these incompetent women (after all they can't even handle this natural process right). Who knows, maybe one of the evil women doesn't even want it! *gasp* could you imagine?!\n \n Sorry, it amuses me to no end that some things make some pro-life people all up in arms and others are shrugged off as part of life.\n\n Where did you get the idea that miscarriages don't bother me?

Stopping the pregnancy, discontinuing the gestation, terminating the pregnancy, terminating the fetus, killing the fetus embryo or zygote, preventing implantation, birth control, etc. What is your point?\n\n My point is that the fetus is the object of the woman's choice. And that matters. She is not simply ending a pregnancy. \n \n \nWhat are your 2 definitions and at what times to they apply? Why do you need 2 definitions anyway?\n\n I already stated the definition that we were debating and I think the other is obvious.\n \n \nPerhaps the most major change is this: Before birth the fetus was inside and attached, after birth it is neither of those things. Before birth the woman had a living entity inside of her and living off of her organs, after birth she does not.\n\n I don't think this change is sufficient to support abortion.\n \n \nPeople should have the legal rights to their own bodies, maximus, even if by doing so they kill another.

Consenting to sex is consenting to sex, no more. Removing her rights because a woman has sex is barbaric and amoral, in my opinion.

But to blame it on the fetus is not just.\n\n \n Ah, I do not believe it is the cause of all of her problems (in this hypothetical example). If I implied so before then I mispoke. She can, however, view the fetus as the source of all her problems with the pregnancy. If the problems are related to the pregnancy, and the source of the pregnancy (so to speak) is the fetus, I fail to see where my logic fails.\n \n \n\n Where did you get the idea that miscarriages don't bother me?

Would you consider it a greater injustice if someone's life was taken from them by another or if they died naturally? A natural miscarriage and an abortion are very different things. \n\n \n It depends. Is it killing or dying naturally if one is removed from life support? Is it killing or dying naturally when the fetus is denied the use of the mother as a lifesupport system? Injustice? I view it as a great injustice when a mother is forced to carry the fetus to term, when her very personal life is being interfered with on such a scale. \n \n Is eating an herb that one knows will cause a miscarriage natural?\n \n \n\n My point is that the fetus is the object of the woman's choice. And that matters. She is not simply ending a pregnancy. \n\n \n If she is not simply ending a pregnancy, what do you believe she is doing? Do you not realize that incubating a fetus is being pregnant?\n \n \n\n I already stated the definition that we were debating and I think the other is obvious.\n\n \n Why is it that you need 2 definitions? Where do we cease using one and start using the other? I'm afraid you only posted one definition.\n \n \n\n I don't think this change is sufficient to support abortion.\n\n \n The change? The reason I support abortion is what happens before the change. Namely, that the woman is being used in a way that she may not desire or consent to.\n \n \n\n Would your brother be allowed to actively kill you to alleviate his condition?\n\n \n Does not follow. That would only follow if the fetus kills the mother to support it's lack of organs. \n \n The analogy would be if I caused his condition, should he be allowed to be surgically attached to me without my desire or consent, living off of what I have and he lacks, putting stress on my body. Should I have the legal ability to sever that connection, given that I do not want to be connected and did not consent to being connected, even if that would kill him? Morally I might be reprehensible to do so, but I do not believe many would question my right.\n \n \n\n Killing children is barbaric and amoral in my opinon. Putting sex at a higher status than human life is barbaric and amoral. \n\n \n Perhaps if you clarify? How would legalizing abortion put sex at a higher status than human life? I believe we are putting women at a higher status than what they are carrying.\n \n The only point I made with sex is that consenting to sex is consenting to sex. Consenting to sex is not consenting to being pregnant.\n \n \n\n Pregnancy and motherhood should never be looked upon as a punishment. When people look on it in that way then they seek abortion.\n\n \n It is a punishment if she is required to go through with the pregnancy. If she has the right to an abortion, it isn't a requirement. Is it a punishment if she is not required to do it but is a choice?\n \n You truly believe that it shouldn't be a punishment? Then why are you legislating it with your rational being \"They had sex so they must gestate and birth the entity\"? You are treating sex as something wrong by legislating a consequence for it, a punishment. That punishment is pregnancy, in your eyes.\n \n Think for a moment. If a woman got a STD as a consequence to sex, you would not force her to deal with it as a natural consequence to sex, you would allow treatment. Why not? The same arguments you have used apply. She should not have had sex when she knew that a possible consequence to having sex would be to contract a STD.\n \n Yes, I know it is a life, but if that is your point then stop the BS about it being a consequence for sex and that she \"consented to the consequences\". If you cannot hold up your argument on the fact that it is a life, then perhaps you should rethink your argument.\n \n \n\n The woman has the rights to her body and the fetus has the rights to his body.\n\n \n Then let her control her body, even if it does cause another to die. It is her body, her right to control it and it's resources.\n \n \n\n How about locale? Would that do?\n\n \n They are in the same local yet are physically distinct from one another?",

I do not believe so. However, I am not using that argument. When arguing morality, if there is no absolute you are left with relative morality. Your argument above is flawed, using it still makes stealing immoral.\n\n So, by your definition, a person is an independent human being. Anyone or anything that is not independent is not a person. If something/someone is not a person, then it would not be morally wrong to kill them. I do not consider fetuses to be able to live independently, but neither can newborn babies, toddlers, young children, quadriplegics, humans (not saying people right here because by your definition they are not people) with certain mental disabilities, some elderly, etc. By your definition, it would be morally acceptable to kill all of these people. Are you sure you want to stick with \"independence\" = personhood?\n \n If they are given the same protection, it opens a whole new can of worms which needs to be considered. Should embryos from IVF be all used or saved forever since discarding them is murder? By my argument, yes.\n \n \n I would also like to point out that a fetus is definitely not part of the woman's body. If it was, then the DNA would be identical. The fetus is a foreign tissue being housed by the woman's uterus. The woman also does not have the right to remove her uterus (even though that technically IS part of her body) because to do so would kill the person inside, which would be immoral. Also women aren't actually in control of their bodies anyway, or else they could just control not getting pregnant in the first place. \n \n \n If viability is what makes a fetus a person (and not independence), then you must be able to prove at what point a fetus is viable, a not perform abortions after that point. Otherwise you would be killing a person, which I think we both agree is immoral. How do we prove such a thing? You cannot. If you take a baby at x gestation and say \"it is not viable\" and abort it, you kill it. You cannot prove whether that baby was viable or not, because with abortion, all viability is zero. It is a circular argument: \"This fetus was not viable [because we killed it] therefore since it was not viable, killing it was moral.\" In order for viability to be an accurate gauge of personhood, you need to prove it's viability before you perform the abortion. You cannot remove the fetus in one piece, lay it on the table, and if it dies say \"ok, it's not viable, lets put it back in and then perform the abortion.\" If you remove the fetus and lay it on a table and it survives...then I guess you send the patient home because killing the fetus would then be immoral because it is viable, and therefore a person. \n \n You cannot take an average gestation age for viability and use that as your guide, because not all fetuses become viable at x gestation. It is different for every fetus. If you assume that fetus A is not viable because it has reached x gestation and abort it, you are potentially killing a person if indeed the fetus was viable at x gestation. Using viability as this guide is impossible, because there is no way of proving viability without potentially killing the fetus. \n \n My \"Stedman's Medical Dictionary\" says viability is:\" capability of living; the state of being viable, usually connotes a fetus that has reached five hundred grams in weight and twenty gestational weeks.\" Note the use of the word usually. This means: cannot be known all the time. Also, twenty gestational weeks is not the entire term of gestation, there are twenty additional weeks of gestation in which abortion must be wrong, by this definition. That makes this argument a contradiction, since abortion can either be right, or abortion can be wrong. It cannot be both. \n \n \n So is it viability or independence? It has to be one or the other, since to be both would be self-contradictory.",

   "So, by your definition, a person is an independent human being. Anyone or anything that is not independent is not a person. If something/someone is not a person, then it would not be morally wrong to kill them. I do not consider fetuses to be able to live independently, but neither can newborn babies, toddlers, young children, quadriplegics, humans (not saying people right here because by your definition they are not people) with certain mental disabilities, some elderly, etc. By your definition, it would be morally acceptable to kill all of these people. Are you sure you want to stick with \"independence\" = personhood?\n\n \n I assume you read my definition earlier in the debate, then? If you read it again, it says \"A physically distinct entity would have to be independent of other entities for its bodily processes. By bodily processes I mean waste-management, oxygen circulation and other organ processes.\"\n \n An infant is self-sufficient in terms of organ processes. A fetus is not.\n \n It is true that an infant is not independent in terms of being able to survive on it's own without nourishment and shelter, but then neither would you. Are you not independent?\n \n \n\n If they are given the same protection, it opens a whole new can of worms which needs to be considered. Should embryos from IVF be all used or saved forever since discarding them is murder? By my argument, yes.\n\n \n You are aware that with IVF, a number of fertilized eggs are injected in and any that do not implant (the majority in most cases) are flushed out of the woman's system, correct? There is no way to save them. By your argument, IVF is immoral because there is an almost guaranteed loss with every injection.\n \n This is a story from Peter Singer and Deanne Well's discussion of gametes and embryos. Embryo is used in place of zygote, but that does not negate the importance.\n \n \"Many people find such questions [regarding the moral status of the enbryo] bewildering. Seeing no way of answering them, they throw up their hands and say, \"Its all up to the individual's subjective judgement.\" Our aim is to show that there IS a rational answer to these questions that should carry conviction with everyone who accepts one very widely held premise: that it is not wrong to destroy either the egg or the sperm before they have united. On the basis of this premise, we shall argue that there is no moral obligation to preserve the life of the embryo\" (70). \n \n \"Our argument begins from the premise that it is not wrong to destroy either the egg or sperm--the gametes, as they are collectively known--before they have united. We do not know of anyone who seriously asserts that the moral status of the egg and sperm before fertilization is such that it is wrong to destroy them. For instance, if a man is asked to produce a specimen of semen so that it can be testes to see if it is fertile, no one objects to the semen being tipped out once the test is complete. And after all in our normal lives eggs and sperm are constantly being wasted....Does anyone regard this as a terrible tragedy? Not to our knowledge; and so we do not think the premise of our argument is likely to be challenged.\" (71) \n \n \"We shall consider some imaginary stories. They do not describ actual occurances or even probable ones. We are using them to illistrate a moral point\" \n \n \n \n\"First Story: \n Doctors working on an IVF program have obtained a fertile egg from a patient and some semen from the patient's husband. They are just about to drop the semen into the glass dish containing the egg when the doctor in charge of the patient calls to say that he has discovered that she has a medical condition that makes pregnancy impossible. The egg could be fertalized and returned to the womb, but implantation would not occur. The embryo would die and be expelled during the woman's next monthly cycle. There is therefore no point in proceeding to fertalize the egg. So the egg and semen are tipped, separately down the sink.\" \n\n \n Any objections so far?\n \n \n\n \"Second Story: \n Everything happens exactly as in the first story, except that the doctor in charge of the patient calls with the bad news AFTER the egg and sperm have been placed in the glass petri dish and fertilization has already taken place. [The couple does not want the zygote to be put into anyone else nor is there any evidence that the woman's condition will change. Thus they ask that the zygote be disposed of] \n \n \"If the [zygote] has a special moral status that makes it wrong to destroy it, it would be wrong to comply with the couple's request. What, then, SHOULD be done with the [zygote]. \n \n \"How plausible is the belief that it is NOT wrong to dispose of the egg and sperm separately, but would be wrong to dispose of them after they have united? For those who believe that there is a real distinction between the two stories, here is a third story, not to be taken too seriously, but intended to bring out the peculiarity of that belief\" (72).\n\n \n It gets better.\n \n \n\n \"Third Story: \n The story begins just as the first one does. The doctor's call comes before the egg and sperm have united, and so they are tipped, separately down the sink. But as luck would have it, the sink is blocked by a surgical dressing. As a result, the egg has not actually gone down the drain before the semen is thrown on top of it. A nurse is about to clear the blockage and flush them away when a though occurs to her: perhaps the egg has been fertalized by the semen that was thrown on top of it! If that has happened, or if there is any significant chance that it happened, those who believe that the [zygote] has a special moral status that makes it wrong to destroy it must now believe that it would be wrong to clear the blockage. Instead the egg must now be rescued from the sink, checked to see if fertilization has occurred, and if it has, efforts should presumably be made to keep it alive\" (72). \n \n \"On what grounds could one try and defend the view that the coming together of the egg and sperm makes such a crucial difference to the way that they ought to be treated?\" (Singer 73). \n\n \n If it is a person at the point of conception, it would be criminal to not do everything in their power including tearing up the piping to rescue that peice of cloth. You wish to ascribe the same moral weight to that scrap of cloth as to a born child, ascribe rights superior to a woman carrying that just fertilized zygote (since it's rights are backed by the law, the woman's is not). I strongly disagree.\n \n \n\n I would also like to point out that a fetus is definitely not part of the woman's body. If it was, then the DNA would be identical. The fetus is a foreign tissue being housed by the woman's uterus. The woman also does not have the right to remove her uterus (even though that technically IS part of her body) because to do so would kill the person inside, which would be immoral. Also women aren't actually in control of their bodies anyway, or else they could just control not getting pregnant in the first place. \n\n \n I would like to point out that the mitochondria in your cells have separate and distinct DNA from you.\n \n Foreign tissue? Similar to a organ transplant? Now the organ's that have been attached are not a part of the person housing them? Tell me, is it immoral to have a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) to save the life of the woman as in a rupture of the uterus walls if it would kill the fetus? You say it would be immoral, but I have not accepted that it is a person. Nor do I believe it would be immoral to kill a person in this instance, if that person was living off of her organs. She has every moral right to save herself first.\n \n It is true that we cannot conciously control our bodies. That has never been a claim. The \"right to control our bodies\" is about not letting anyone else control it without our desire or consent, such as being forced to donate, forced to take drugs even if it will save our lives, right to be taken off life-support, etc.\n \n \n\n My \"Stedman's Medical Dictionary\" says viability is:\" capability of living; the state of being viable, usually connotes a fetus that has reached five hundred grams in weight and twenty gestational weeks.\" Note the use of the word usually. This means: cannot be known all the time. Also, twenty gestational weeks is not the entire term of gestation, there are twenty additional weeks of gestation in which abortion must be wrong, by this definition. That makes this argument a contradiction, since abortion can either be right, or abortion can be wrong. It cannot be both. \n \n \n So is it viability or independence? It has to be one or the other, since to be both would be self-contradictory.\n\n \n I never disagreed that viability is a poor point to anchor personhood to, for the reasons that you say. It is not a stable point. Neither do I believe conception to be a stable point.",

   "Adoption is a fine option... for some. I have read that carrying and then birthing the child, and then trying to give it up is much more traumatic than having an abortion. Not everyone wishes to go through that.\n \n Adoption is a parenting choice, however, not a pregnancy choice. The only choices during pregnancy are whether to continue it or not to continue it (in terms of the debate; obviously there are more choices such as what to eat and so on).\n \n Whether or not a woman can afford a child is an important consideration. However, she also has to consider whether or not she can afford the pregnancy. She must take time off of work, she will not be as physically able to do many things. \n \n Financial considerations are only one thing that has to be considered. If she is emotionally fragile, such as in the depth of chronic depression or a psycological problem she is being treated for, a pregnancy can seriously undermine her emotional wellbeing. Hormonal imbalances can cause even a stable person to be very out of wack. Some women may not be able to deal with a pregnancy during that time. I do not believe we are morally able to force her, let alone legally.\n \n If a woman, or a girl in this case, is underage, she may not feel mentally prepared to go through a pregnancy or carry the child. She may fear verbal abuse at home for becoming pregnant, or from her boyfriend. She may be mentally unstable or mentally retarded, and may not feel that she can mentally handle the stress of carrying a fetus or raising a child. I do not feel we can morally force a woman or girl to carry a pregnancy to term.\n \n Physical considerations go farther than life-threatening. Some conditions would simply worsen with pregnancy, such as heart conditions, without directly threatening her life. Physical abuse from families, from boyfriends perhaps, would also be a physical consideration. If she is in a situation that she cannot escape from, or does not feel she can escape from, and a pregnancy would make her position that much more worse, I do not feel we can morally force her to carry it.\n \n Financial considerations also go far beyond simply \"I cannot afford a child\". If a girl or woman is on financial aid to go to college, but cannot take as many or any units to care for herself she can be taken off financial aid. If she has no other means to support herself, where can she go? If she is turned out of the house for becoming pregnant, if she cannot work because she is pregnant, if if if. There are as many different situations as there are women to experience them. I do not believe we can sit here and judge that this woman or that is not justified in getting an abortion. I believe each woman must decide for herself whether getting an abortion is the right decision for her situation.\n \n You do not understand how woman can have an abortion. But the fact that you do not understand their reasons does not negate their reasons. The description seems barbaric to you. That is a valid view. I should note that if funding is cut off, then the techniques will not benefit from modern medicine and women will most likely die much more often. As it is, it is a very safe procedure, like any surgery (any surgery can sound barbaric, no matter what they are doing).\n\n \n \n \n \n A Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome? \n \n Yes. This type of problem was first seen in large numbers in Vietnam veterans, but did not manifest it-self until a decade after they returned. The same ten-year delay has been evident with abortion. T. Keane, Vietnam Vets Trauma disorder level at 15%, Am. Med. News, L. Abraham, Dec. 2, 1988, p. 2\n \n What is Post Abortion Syndrome (PAS)? \n \n Many women are very ambivalent about getting aborted but do go ahead. Those around her told her (and she told herself) that it wouldn't bother her. When symptoms occur, she tells herself it can't be the abortion causing them, and then into play come her two major psychological defense mechanisms: \n Repression and Denial. \n \n For some this works successfully. For others it shades off to manageable distress, to severe and life-changing upset and even to suicide. \n \n What are the symptoms of PAS?\n \n Guilt is ever present in many guises, along with regret, remorse, shame, lowered self-esteem, insomnia, dreams and nightmares, flash backs, anniversary reactions. There often is hostility, and even hatred, toward men. This can include her husband, and she may be-come sexually dysfunctional. Crying, despair and depression are usual, even at times with suicide attempts.\n \n Recourse to alcohol or drugs to mask the pain is frequent, sometimes leading to sexual promiscuity. There is also a numbing and coldness in place of more normal warmth and maternal tenderness.\n \n Suiciders Anonymous, and that: suicide post-abortion is several times more common than post-delivery. British Medical Jour., 1996\n \n Can infection cause damage? \n \n Infection in the womb and tubes often does permanent damage. The Fallopian tube is a fragile organ, a very tiny bore tube. If infection injures it, it often seals shut. The typical infection involving these organs is pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\n \n Patients with Chlamydia Trachomatous infection of the cervix (13% in this series) who get induced abortion \"run a 23% risk of developing PID.\" E. Quigstad et al., British Jour. of Venereal Disease, June 1982, p. 182 \n \n \"Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) is difficult to manage and often leads to infertility, even with prompt treatment . . . Approximately 10% of women will develop tubal adhesions leading to infertility after one episode of PID, 30% after two episodes, and more than 60% after three episodes.\" M. Spence, \"PID: Detection & Treatment,\" Sexually Transmitted Disease Bulletin, John Hopkins Univ., vol. 3, no. 1, Feb. 1983 \n \n \"Acute inflammatory conditions occur in 5% of the cases, whereas permanent complications such as chronic inflammatory conditions of the female organs, sterility, and ectopic [tubal] pregnancies are registered in 20-30% of all women . . . these are definitely higher in primigravidas [aborted for first pregnancy].\"\n \n Kodasek, \"Artificial Termination of Pregnancy in Czechoslovakia,\" Internat'l Jour. GYN/OB, vol. 9, no. 3, 1971 Venereal disease, usually Gonorrhea or Chlamydia, causes PID. This, if present, vastly complicates an induced abortion. \"Chlamydia trachomatous was cultured from the cervix in 70 of 557 women admitted for therapeutic abortion. Among the 70, 22 developed acute PID postoperatively (4% of the total).\" E. Quigstad et al., \"PID Associated with C. Trachomatous Infection, A Prospective Study,\" British Jour. of Venereal Disease, vol. 59, no. 3, 1982, pp. 189-192 \n \n Another study revealed a 17% incidence of post-abortal Chlamydia infection. Barbacci et al., \"Post Abortal Endometritis and Chlamydia,\" OB & GYN, 68:686, 1986. \n \n In a classic English study at a university hospital which reported on four years' experience, \"there was a 27% complication rate from infection.\n \n \n So I'm sorry but it's not as safe as everybody says it is!!!!\n If You Adopt...When you think of your baby, you will think of him or her as happy and loved by a mommy and daddy.\n \n You will have precious memories of your baby's face, fingers, toes, eyes and smile.\n \n You will know you gave the greatest gift of all - a child, to a couple whose hope and dream was a baby to love.\n \n If You Abort...\n There is no baby to think of; no smile, no little fingers or toes to remember.

   "Sigma,\n \nAh, I do not believe it is the cause of all of her problems (in this hypothetical example). If I implied so before then I mispoke. She can, however, view the fetus as the source of all her problems with the pregnancy. If the problems are related to the pregnancy, and the source of the pregnancy (so to speak) is the fetus, I fail to see where my logic fails.\n\n The source of the pregnancy is not the fetus. The man and woman created the fetus. The fetus did not create the pregnancy. The woman is pregnant with a  fetus. No action is taken by the fetus to create himself or to willfully complicate the pregnancy and endanger the mother.\n \n \nWasn't so much of an emotional argument as a sarcastic rant ;) Do you not know that people grieve even if they get an abortion? If miscarriages bother you, why don't you actively campaign to do something about it? Because it would be interfering with a woman's body?\n\n Yes, I do know that people grieve when they have an abortion. Have you thought about why they grieve?\n \n The pro-life movement has always said this and offers help and counseling for those women who have been through an abortion. \n \n What type of campaign would you propose I start to do something about miscarriages? The causes are most often unknown.\n \n \nIt depends. Is it killing or dying naturally if one is removed from life support? Is it killing or dying naturally when the fetus is denied the use of the mother as a lifesupport system? Injustice? I view it as a great injustice when a mother is forced to carry the fetus to term, when her very personal life is being interfered with on such a scale. \n \n That is a difficult and complex question that cannot be answered with a few words. I do believe that removing life support can be immoral in certain situations. How would you deny the use of the mother to the fetus? Do you have a new method of abortion that does not actively kill the fetus?\n \n \nIs eating an herb that one knows will cause a miscarriage natural?\n\n Of course it is \"natural.\" But it is also immoral. Natural versus unnatural is not my concern. Moral versus immoral is. Justice versus injustice is. Knowingly killing someone with a natural herb is not much different than knowingly killing them with surgical instruments.\n \n \nIf she is not simply ending a pregnancy, what do you believe she is doing? Do you not realize that incubating a fetus is being pregnant?\n\n I said that she was not simply ending a pregnancy. She is killing a person to end that pregnancy. She is pregnant with something--that something is a person. She must terminate the person to terminate the pregnancy.\n \n \nWhy is it that you need 2 definitions? Where do we cease using one and start using the other? I'm afraid you only posted one definition.\n\n I thought it was evident that you and I would fall under a slightly different definition being that we are not located one in the other.\n \n \nThe change? The reason I support abortion is what happens before the change. Namely, that the woman is being used in a way that she may not desire or consent to.\n\n So the woman is allowed to abort the child 1 minute before delivery? 10 seconds before delivery? Your dividing line is very thin.\n \n \nDoes not follow. That would only follow if the fetus kills the mother to support it's lack of organs. \n \n The analogy would be if I caused his condition, should he be allowed to be surgically attached to me without my desire or consent, living off of what I have and he lacks, putting stress on my body. Should I have the legal ability to sever that connection, given that I do not want to be connected and did not consent to being connected, even if that would kill him? Morally I might be reprehensible to do so, but I do not believe many would question my right.\n\n When you caused his condition did he become attached to you without his consent and begin depending on you for his life? Did you then actively kill him to end his dependence on you? Yes, the analogy does break down.\n \n I think there would be people that would question your right. Have you heard of people being sentenced for knowingly affecting others with HIV?\n \n \nPerhaps if you clarify? How would legalizing abortion put sex at a higher status than human life? I believe we are putting women at a higher status than what they are carrying.\n The only point I made with sex is that consenting to sex is consenting to sex. Consenting to sex is not consenting to being pregnant.\n\n You support the ability to kill human life after it results from sex if one did not want to be pregnant. If one is allowed to protect pregnant free sex by killing, then sex is valued more than life, wouldn't you say? When abortion is used as a safe-guard for failed contraception then sex is placed at a higher value than life.\n \n \nIt is a punishment if she is required to go through with the pregnancy. If she has the right to an abortion, it isn't a requirement. Is it a punishment if she is not required to do it but is a choice?\n\n If I require  you to go to school for 13 years is that a punishment?\n \n \nYou truly believe that it shouldn't be a punishment? Then why are you legislating it with your rational being \"They had sex so they must gestate and birth the entity\"? You are treating sex as something wrong by legislating a consequence for it, a punishment. That punishment is pregnancy, in your eyes.\n\n It should never be viewed as a punishment whether required or not. I am not treating sex as something wrong by legislating a consequence. I cannot legislate a fetus into being and I will not call it a punishment. \n \n I say sex outside of marriage is wrong, not sex with pregnancy is wrong. Pregnancy after sex is right, within the proper context. Killing however is wrong. And I am treating it as such. You cannot say when someone has an abortion that they are dealing with the sex they had 3 months ago. They are dealing with a child that results from sex.\n \n I am saying that the fetus is more than a consequence. \n \n \nThink for a moment. If a woman got a STD as a consequence to sex, you would not force her to deal with it as a natural consequence to sex, you would allow treatment. Why not? The same arguments you have used apply. She should not have had sex when she knew that a possible consequence to having sex would be to contract a STD.\n \n Yes, I know it is a life, but if that is your point then stop the BS about it being a consequence for sex and that she \"consented to the consequences\". If you cannot hold up your argument on the fact that it is a life, then perhaps you should rethink your argument.\n\n Why not? Because I am not out to punish women. This reinforces the fact that I do not see pregnancy as a punishment.\n \n If one has sex within marriage where sex is rightfully had then the chance of contracting a disease is minimal.\n \n Treating an STD is different than killing a baby. One can treat an STD without killing another.\n \n \nThey are in the same local yet are physically distinct from one another?\n\n Yes.",

   "Sigma,\n \n The source of the pregnancy is not the fetus. The man and woman created the fetus. The fetus did not create the pregnancy. The woman is pregnant with a  fetus. No action is taken by the fetus to create himself or to willfully complicate the pregnancy and endanger the mother.\n\n \n Of course the woman is pregnant with a fetus. She cannot be pregnant with anything else. The fact that there is a fetus inside her makes her pregnant. Whether or not the fetus willfully caused complications does not mean that it does not cause complications.\n \n \n\n Yes, I do know that people grieve when they have an abortion. Have you thought about why they grieve?\n \n The pro-life movement has always said this and offers help and counseling for those women who have been through an abortion. \n \n What type of campaign would you propose I start to do something about miscarriages? The causes are most often unknown.\n\n \n Have you? You seem to think women casually go in and have abortions as a form of birth control, when the reality is that in general women would not do it if they felt they could care for the child. \n \n I'm glad the pro-life movement offers councelling. Good for them :) As long as they don't try to make the women feel guilty about their decision (what a time to preach, when she's fragile and vulnerable. Effective, but rotten, in my opinion :( ).\n \n I don't know what type of campaign you should start. However, the fact that 1/3 of all pregnancies end in miscarriage is a large number. I believe I read that 1 in 10 women have abortions. If 1 in 3 will have a miscarriage, there are a huge number of deaths that should be stopped, should they not? No one is investigating these deaths, no one seems to care that 30% of people created are simply dying, in the womb. Should we not more carefully monitor what the woman eats and does so no possible harm comes to the fetus to lower this terrible number?\n \n \n\n That is a difficult and complex question that cannot be answered with a few words. I do believe that removing life support can be immoral in certain situations. How would you deny the use of the mother to the fetus? Do you have a new method of abortion that does not actively kill the fetus?\n\n \n I could deny the use of a person as life-support for another, if the person giving the support never consented or desired it.\n \n If I could separate the woman from the fetus safely, I believe no woman would want to have a procedure that killed the fetus. As it is, the only way for the woman to not have a fetus inside of her is to kill it. I believe it is her right to do so.\n \n \n\n Of course it is \"natural.\" But it is also immoral. Natural versus unnatural is not my concern. Moral versus immoral is. Justice versus injustice is. Knowingly killing someone with a natural herb is not much different than knowingly killing them with surgical instruments.\n\n \n Then may I say that I believe that forcing a \"natural\" action upon her, namely pregnancy, is immoral?\n \n I agree that killing with an herb is not different (in terms of intent) than using a surgical instrument. If a woman does this early in the pregnancy, how will we know?\n \n \n\n I said that she was not simply ending a pregnancy. She is killing a person to end that pregnancy. She is pregnant with something--that something is a person. She must terminate the person to terminate the pregnancy.\n\n \n Why do you call it a person? Where did you get the idea that it was a person?\n \n \n\n I thought it was evident that you and I would fall under a slightly different definition being that we are not located one in the other.\n\n \n Ok, so then the definition would change at birth? Once the entity is born, then it falls under a different definition to make it physically distinct?\n \n \n\n So the woman is allowed to abort the child 1 minute before delivery? 10 seconds before delivery? Your dividing line is very thin.\n\n \n Somehow I doubt that if a woman did not want a child she would have waited until delivery to do something about it, unless there was a serious and compelling reason such as the delivery killing her. In a case like that, she can kill it as long as it is threatening her life.\n \n More philosophically, yes I believe she has the moral right to have it removed from dependence upon her organs. Of course, if the fetus can survive on it's own, a premature delivery can be performed and do the desired function.\n \n \n\n When you caused his condition did he become attached to you without his consent and begin depending on you for his life? Did you then actively kill him to end his dependence on you? Yes, the analogy does break down.\n\n \n If, through some terrible accident I caused but did not intend, he became fused to me and dependent upon my body, yes I do believe I have the legal right to be detached. Morally I might be reprehensible, but I should have the right.\n \n \n\n I think there would be people that would question your right. Have you heard of people being sentenced for knowingly affecting others with HIV?\n\n \n I do not understand how this related to my analogy :-\\\n \n \n\n You support the ability to kill human life after it results from sex if one did not want to be pregnant. If one is allowed to protect pregnant free sex by killing, then sex is valued more than life, wouldn't you say? When abortion is used as a safe-guard for failed contraception then sex is placed at a higher value than life.\n\n \n In a sense. However, the main thrust of the pro-choice movement (in my opinion) deals with the pregnancy relationship, and the fact that a woman should not hand over her body to another because she had sex. Her right to her own body is superior to the fetus' right to her body.\n \n \n\n If I require  you to go to school for 13 years is that a punishment?\n\n \n It depends. Is it legislated as a consequence of an action? If I must go to a school for 13 years if I do an action that is not in and of itself illegal, and it is against my will, can you say it isn't a punishment?\n \n \n\n It should never be viewed as a punishment whether required or not. I am not treating sex as something wrong by legislating a consequence. I cannot legislate a fetus into being and I will not call it a punishment. \n\n \n If you are forcing something undesirable upon someone because of something they did, you are using what you forcing as a punishment.\n \n \n\n I say sex outside of marriage is wrong, not sex with pregnancy is wrong. Pregnancy after sex is right, within the proper context. Killing however is wrong. And I am treating it as such. You cannot say when someone has an abortion that they are dealing with the sex they had 3 months ago. They are dealing with a child that results from sex.\n\n \n It is wrong in your opinion. Pregnancy is right in your opinion. Killing is wrong in your opinion. Most would agree in most situations to the last, but it remains an opinion. However, it isn't as simple as \"she is killing so she should be stopped\". What is she killing? Something that is attached and drawing nutrients out of her and is living off of her organs. Killing is justified in some situations, and I believe this is one of them.\n \n Abortion is a consequence for some women. That their decision was 3 monthes down the line is irrelevant. It could take years to have consequences for an action.\n \n \n\n I am saying that the fetus is more than a consequence. \n\n \n Then don't treat it as a consequence by legislating it into a consequence. Leave it to the woman, as is right.\n \n \n\n Why not? Because I am not out to punish women. This reinforces the fact that I do not see pregnancy as a punishment.\n\n \n You are treating pregnancy as a punishment if it is legislated as an unwanted consequence to an action.\n \n \n\n If one has sex within marriage where sex is rightfully had then the chance of contracting a disease is minimal.\n \n Treating an STD is different than killing a baby. One can treat an STD without killing another.\n\n \n Suddenly the chances of it happening matter? It is a known consequence to sex. Each couple that has sex accepts the possibility of it happening, so their choice about whether or not they were going to have it was made when they had sex. Treating an STD is different than killing a fetus, baby, or a horse for that matter. \n \n If you don't believe a woman or man should \"just deal\" with a STD, then drop the argument \"She accepted the possibility when she had sex\". \n \n \nYes.\n\n \n I'll have to take your word for it, because it doesn't make too much sense to me ;)",
