   "A recent pole showed that a slight majority of Americans think we are on the wrong track. I concur, but probably for different reasons than many. In my view we have been on the wrong track since:\n \n Our government decided every one from birth should be identified and registered though the convenience of the social security system, using the subtrifuge of tax fairness through verification of depentents.\n \n Our government decided we should have to have its approval (=permission) to take on employment, through the ruse of job protection. \n \n The on slought of safety paranoia, intruding ever more into individual choice and responsiblity, making a circus over \"buckling up\" and telling us where and how to seat our children at the expense of not only just liberty but of objectively addressing the problem of cause.\n \n To be fair, not everyone having advocated or supported these measures did so to reduce our liberties. Focus was simply of the immediate without regard to the broader implications. What ever the honest reasons were for these measures, they fall way short of the principles abrogated. \n \n And there are more.",

   "We suffer from the benefits of a democracy. As long as 51% of the people want the country to go a certain direction, we go. The other 49% don't have to like it or even agree with it, they just have to respect the majority or the whole system falls apart. This is one of those times in history when the country is virtually split on the direction of our country, particularly as it pertains to our foreign policy. That means that roughly half of us ( or more ) are unhappy with our current administration. All I can say is that's why we have elections every 4 years.",
