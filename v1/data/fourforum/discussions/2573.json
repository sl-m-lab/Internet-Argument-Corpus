   "In the mid-1970's, as a 22 year old man, I came into contact with members of Assemblies of God, a local Pentecostal church in my new hometown. I was by that time a born-again Christian for roughly two years, thanks to my newfound friends, the evangelical Baptists. I was captivated by the zeal with which these Pentecostalists practiced their faith. (I was brought up in the Lutheran tradition, noted for our completely stoic nature, our mumbling through hymns, resting our eyes during sermons and keeping one's faith to oneself.) One day, an exurberant Pentecostalist breathlessly told me of the free gifts that God has waiting for us just for the asking, and brought to my attention the following passages from 1 Corinthians 12: 1-10:\n \n 12:1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.\n \n 12:2 \n Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.\n \n 12:3 \n Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.\n \n 12:4 \n Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.\n \n 12:5 \n And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.\n \n 12:6 \n And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.\n \n 12:7 \n But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.\n \n 12:8 \n For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;\n \n 12:9 \n To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;\n \n 12:10 \n To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers[e] kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues...\n \n This was exciting information to me, and I was eager to receive my free gift. But I instinctively knew what it meant if I received the gift of tongues. It meant God was calling me to the ministry, and I would faithfully do what he told me. That night, while my wife was watching TV, and my toddler was playing on the living room floor, I went to our bedroom, locked the door, turned off the light, got on my knees and asked for forgiveness of all my sins, then asked the Holy Spirit to come into my life and give me the gift of speaking in tongues.\n \n Welcome to the world of Pentecostalism, the fastest growing religion in the U.S. today. It is difficult to put a meaningful number to its adherents, including worldwide, but some estimates are approaching that of Roman Catholicism. Pentecostalism is at its core closely associated with fundamentalism (the belief in biblical inerrancy) but distinguishes itself by its belief in the speaking of tongues, a belief in exorcisms, and at its fringes, snake-handlings. \n \n It has its beginnings on the very first day of the 20th century, by the Methodist preacher Charles Parham, who was attempting a unique understanding of the following passages from Acts 2:1-4:\n \n 2:1\n And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.\n \n 2:2 \n And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.\n \n 2:3 \n And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.\n \n 2:4 \n And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.\n \n Most denominations believed these \"acts\" were miracles God bestowed on the early church until it became established. But Parham believed that instead of a baptism with water in Jesus' name, one needed a baptism of the Holy Spirit, and it would evidence itself by the speaking of tongues much like the apostles experienced in the 2nd century. Finally, he got the breakthrough he was looking for: One of his female parishioners began \"talking in an unknown language\" on January 1st, 1901, and the world of Pentecostalism exploded upon the world.\n \n It had as its first adherents poor, uneducated, low-income Southerners, both white and black. It continues that demographic today with some exceptions. The services are known for their raucousnesss, hand-waving amens, vocalizations that approach a frenzy, and the pews sometimes sound like a virtual barnyard. At the proper moment, the preacher will begin the evidence of the Holy Spirit, the speaking of tongues. Believers say the language is not known to listeners, it is a dead language from centuries past. Sociologists who have studied the phenomenon have concluded it is a string of nonsense vowels.\n \n Indeed, church members can attend late evening classes where speaking in tongues is practiced to become more proficient in the art form in case the Holy Spirit didn't quite fill up the tank. \n \n Televangelists like Oral Roberts and Benny Hinn practice faith-healing through elaborate stagings, pretending to have a magical formula that causes anyone to swoon and fall at their slightest touch, then they leave town with the money and leave behind people in need of real medical attention.\n \n Snake-handlers believe God protects them from all poisons, according to the last interpolated verses of Mark (Mark 16:9-20), and the recent case of the Florida preacher who died from a snake bite while the congregation looked on is pathetic. \n \n In 1994, enthusiasts from around the world flew to the Toronto Int'l Airport, and there participated in what has become known as \"Holy Laughter\", a condition which continues to this day in some people who are so intoxicated with the spirit that laughing is chronic.\n \n As for me in the dark bedroom, I finished my heart-felt prayer and waited in silence, my heart beating wildly in anticipation. I remember trying to think of something meaningful to say then finally just saying, \"Testing one, two.\" It was in English. It's hard to say how I felt, when I look back on it. A Moses I wasn't, as I came back into the living room, obviously my face was not shining and my hair had not gone shock-white since my wife hardly glanced at me. I sat down in my chair and tried to make sense of it all, but had no idea it would be over 15 years before a relentless pursuit of the truth led me to the real epiphany: Pentecostalism is a sham, and its practioners know it.",

   "Greetings to Billsco and All:\n \n Billsco concludes << I sat down in my chair and tried to make sense of it all, but had no idea it would be over 15 years before a relentless pursuit of the truth led me to the real epiphany: Pentecostalism is a sham, and its practitioners know it.\n \n Terral's reply << You certainly had me going there for a few minutes, as I expected you to describe yourself as one of the millions who fall for the trickery of the sham. I am from a family of ministers who are predominately from the Pentecostal persuasion (Church of God and Assemblies of God). Our debates at family reunions become so heated, that sometimes the combatants must be separated. Please allow me to provide some background information to your topic, so that hopefully others will not be deceived and deluded into following this form of false teaching.\n \n Members of the Pentecostal movement (like the practitioners of Catholicism) believe that our church today is tied to the Kingdom dispensation of the Four Gospels and Acts. They fail to recognize this 'dispensation of God's grace' (Eph. 3:2) as a separate Grace Administration under the stewardship of the Apostle Paul. Instead of 'rightly dividing' (cutting straight) the word of truth (2Tim. 2:15), they take the precepts of doctrine that pertain to both administrations, mix them all together, and utilize the parts that taste good to them. Paul writes, \"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but {wanting} to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths.\" 2Tim. 4:3+4.\n \n The sign gifts of your New Testament were given to Kingdom Disciples, after they received the three baptisms of the Kingdom Administration. (Please see my post under Biblical Contradictions here: http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2506 ). This was in accordance with Christ's commands (Mark 16:15+16) pertaining to the 'gospel of the kingdom.' Matt. 24:14. Note that even after the crucifixion, Peter continued to preach water baptism 'for the forgiveness of sins.' Acts 2:38. Today, our sins are forgiven through Christ's shed blood (Eph. 1:7, Col. 1:20) in accordance with Paul's gospel (Rom. 2:16, 16:25, etc.) described in 1Cor. 15:1-5. The 'one baptism' (Eph. 4:5) for today is the one performed by the One Spirit (1Cor. 12:13) the moment we believe. Eph. 1:13+14. \n \n The Pentecostals have taken the main precept of the gospel of the kingdom (water baptism) and added it to our gospel, which voids the simplicity of the cross. 1Cor. 1:17. By believing and preaching this work as part of Paul's 'Christ crucified' message, they have fallen victim to the deluding influence of 2Thes. 2:7-12 (10). Therefore, I must disagree with you that the practitioners of this man made 'religion' know of the sham, when in actuality they have been deluded. When Satan dangled the bait in your field of view, you did not take it. Many of those who are following Pentecostalism have taken the bait hook, line and sinker. Instead of becoming members of the body of Christ (Rom. 12:4+5, 1Cor. 12:12-14, 27, etc.) they have become members of the body of the antichrist, according to the mystery of lawlessness (2Thes. 2:7). \n \n The signs and wonders associated with the Holy Spirit offering the 'good news of the kingdom of God' (Acts 8:12) ceased almost 2000 years ago. What did Paul say? \"Love never fails; but if {there are gifts of} prophecy, they will be done away; if {there are} tongues, they will cease; if {there is} knowledge, it will be done away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part; but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away.\" 1Cor. 13:8-10. The 'perfect' here represents the completed canonized Text of your New Testament. Tongues is listed among those partial things that would cease.\n \n Many people have the wrong idea about this gift of tongues. The fact that tongues is not vain babbling is taught in your Bible. Peter's entire discourse of Acts 2 was spoken in tongues. The key here is that all of these Jews heard in the language of their native tongue. \"And when this sound occurred, the crowd came together, and were bewildered because each one of them was hearing them speak in his own language.\" Acts 2:6. \"And how is it that we each hear {them} in our own language to which we were born?\" Acts 2:8. So, if your own language happens to be modern English, then that is exactly what you should hear in the presence of real Biblical 'tongues.' Vain babbling that you hear among the Pentecostals is just that. When you hear a message in English, and the German person next to you hears it in German, then you are in the presence of the real Biblical tongues.\n \n Great signs and wonders are not part of this dispensation of God's grace. Paul writes, \"For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for who hopes for what he {already} sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, with perseverance we wait eagerly for it.\" Rom. 8:24+25. Remember that our 'faith' to believe the gospel is the gift of God (Eph. 2:8+9), and \"we have obtained our introduction by faith into this grace.\" Rom. 5:2. Therefore (and this is key), those who seek to add even a single work to the finished work of Christ on the cross never receive that most vital gift of faith. And that is why you see people seeking signs, wonders and miracles. They must see and hear the physical evidence, because of their lack of faith.\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",
