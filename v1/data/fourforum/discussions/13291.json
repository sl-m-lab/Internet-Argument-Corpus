   "  Arms backfire \n Conventional arms control, United Nations-style, won't stem the proliferation of guns that get into the wrong hands. More likely, it will only make bad situations worse.\n \n The United States was one of only two nations that voted against the U.N. resolution last year. Its support among member states could advance a legally binding U.N. treaty creating \"common international standards\" for the import and export of small arms and light weapons. \n \n The trouble is, rogue nations and thugs don't subscribe to \"international standards.\" Worse, a \"right-to-buy\" provision would enable despots to acquire arms freely and inhibit U.S. enforcement of its own arms embargoes against 26 states and/or entities. \n And how would a U.N. gun treaty keep weapons away from world terrorists when, as yet, U.N. members haven't defined exactly what constitutes terrorism?\n \n \"The problem is not the absence of an arms trade treaty. It is the U.N. members that are supplying and buying arms, conniving with terrorists and killing people directly,\" according to a Heritage Foundation analysis.\n \n Iran and Venezuela both fit the bill. And China and Russia -- which abstained on the U.N. resolution -- are leading suppliers to the world's worst regimes.\n The U.S. should speak up, and loudly, against a U.N. arms-trade treaty that isn't merely ineffective but is bound to backfire.\n",

   "Talk about a political and civil nightmare if this imbecilic administration buys into this policy. This is nothing more than the UNs attempt to disarm law abiding nations so the rogue nations which have no respect at all for international laws could accomplish their evil agendas unchecked. To say this would just backfire on us is a massive understatement. emoticon_xdonno",
