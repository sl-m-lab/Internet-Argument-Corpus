   "Now that I think about it, I probably shouldn't have hijacked a post to another post to try and give intelligent points back...it makes it seem like I'm defending. But oh well :)\n \n \nRegardless these images should not portray ANY president as such regardless of party or political stance...\nWell, no matter what it will happen and a protest shouldn't be judged on the few nuts that will show up to anything. \n \n \nNo but it shows that this began to unravel under Bush's watch and he failed to act accordingly and even denied there was a recession...\nIn Bush's defense, he really couldn't stop it at that point. His policies and the policies of the last 20-30 years really contributed. But my point is that Bush is over. Everything from here is Obama and he needs to stop complaining about what happened in the past. Frankly, Obama is acting EXACTLY like Bush to a fault. Don't follow the old coaches play book and then complain about how bad it is. Remember Bush complained he inherited a recession. Another example of them acting oddly similar is their evidence for something. Remember with Iraq Bush painted this picture that Nowhere Town, PA was going to be a crater if we don't attack Iraq? Well, turns out that was false. Remember when Obama said without the stimulus we would have unemployment reach 9%. Turns out that was false too. \n \n Bush and Obama are running off the same playbook and people are falling for it. Granted it got Bush 8 years but still :)\n \n \nIt's simply because the banks won't lend money to middle America. Good old Wall Street...\nAnd why should they? Seems a little silly to talk about (not saying you have) the banks being too risky with lending and then complain they aren't lending enough. They don't want to lend because who knows if that person will have a job tomorrow. Banks are finding other ways to make money right now until that risk goes away. \n \n\n Psh I don't disagree at all on that one..\nHow could you? This bill basically mandates 3-4 huge insurance companies and no others. It's gonna end up like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae but with health insurance.\n \n \nSadly even a health care system that mimics the Swiss won;t pass here either... It's a watered down sad excuse for reform...\nNot when you have senators being bought off, admitting this, and then wondering what's the big deal because that is how things get done. \n \n Talk about a compromise though. Basically the health care plan we are about to get is taking the worst aspects of single-payer and the worst aspects of our current system and combing them together. When we end up with the Amtrak Health Care System, don't blame me.\n \n \nAs well as the Iraq war but hey lets not dig up that old chestnut ...\nno need to dig it up because they still won't bury it. Frankly Ron Paul was right about this. We can do a lot better defending ourself on our own land than we could trying to fight everyone else over there.",

   "Here you go: Text of H.R.3590 as Amendment in Senate: Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - U.S. Congress - OpenCongress Good luck understanding it. It's written specifically to be indecipherable by a layman.\n\n \n Wow, this bill has a lot of XXXX in it. I heard that the full effects will not take effect until 2013, but the tax hikes take place as soon as the bill is passed and worked out. So they pass a bill that will make our healthcare system worse? And the benefits will not even take effect until Obama is out of office and nobody has the chance to experience how bad it is until he is? How cynical is that?",

This person gets to decide whether I get to recieve treatment or not? That is not reform! That is another attempt for more control by the liberals. Obama must be trying to bankrupt the country in order to secure a better hold on the country by the liberal party or something like that. So the high risk pool can be used as an excuse to deny me coverage? If this is supposed to give healthcare to all then this bill is not the way to do it!
