   "From an article in the New Scientist:\n \n Gay brains structured like those of the opposite sex\n \n \nBrain scans have provided the most compelling evidence yet that being gay or straight is a biologically fixed trait.\n \n The scans reveal that in gay people, key structures of the brain governing emotion, mood, anxiety and aggressiveness resemble those in straight people of the opposite sex.\n \n The differences are likely to have been forged in the womb or in early infancy, says Ivanka Savic, who conducted the study at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\n \n Apparently, the wiring and activity of the amygdala, a primitive part of the brain involved in emotional processing, is similar in straight women and gay men, and lesbians and straight men. There are also some differences in brain symmetry as well, with gay men resembling heterosexual women, and lesbians resembling heterosexual men. Of course, this is all still pretty crude analysis, but it's interesting that these differences are likely to have arisen during development.\n \n And yes, I do think the question is relevant to gay rights, because it's well known that attitudes towards gay people correlate with opinions about whether being gay is a natural, non-volitional phenomenon, or a sinful, unchristian choice. Obviously, this current study merely confirms what scientific research over the last few decades has been finding. It's no choice.\n \n I guess for the religious believers, they'll just have to accept that it must be one of their deity's many mistakes. For the rest of us, if we dispense with the antiquated assumption that being gay is some sort disease or dysfunction, all we are left with is that being gay is a perfectly natural variation, whether god intended it or not.\n \n I see no reason to deny gay people the rights to marry on that score.",

Because I would have answered you easily. And the answer is simply this, It's the result of the fallen nature of Man. Homosexuality is an aberration of human sexuality that has been shown in tests to possibly be caused by a deficiency of certain vitamins in pregnant women. The results of that scientific research has been discussed here on 4forums, and if accurate would result in the brain anomalies we are seeing described in this article. It would stand to reason that if certain deficiencies in the mother led to homosexuality in the child that the results would show up in the homosexual brain. \n \n So whatever the actual cause for homosexuality, you can be sure that God didn't create you purposely and personally to be that way. The most obvious reason for knowing that being that if God made you homosexual on purpose, He never would have called it an abomination. Just as God didn't create straight men to grow up to be adulterers or fornicators or murderers or rapists. The nature of sin within the human condition is the result of our fall from grace. And that fall makes us all susceptible to any variety of personal and predominant sins. It is the reason that we ALL need the salvation that only comes with knowing Jesus Christ personally. Whatever predominant sins afflict us, they aren't the result of how God created us, but are the result of the fall from grace and the sinful nature we inherited from Adam. And here is the scriptural evidence that this isn't just my opinion, but is the biblical explanation for the reason that sin/death exists in the human experience.\n \n 1Cr 15:21 For since by a man {came} death, by a man also {came} the resurrection of the dead.\n 1Cr 15:22 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.\n \n \n \n Rom 5:12 Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned--\n Rom 5:13 for until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law.\n Rom 5:14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come.\n Rom 5:15 But the free gift is not like the transgression. For if by the transgression of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many.\n Rom 5:16 The gift is not like {that which came} through the one who sinned; for on the one hand the judgment {arose} from one {transgression} resulting in condemnation, but on the other hand the free gift {arose} from many transgressions resulting in justification.\n Rom 5:17 For if by the transgression of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.\n Rom 5:18 So then as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men.\n Rom 5:19 For as through the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous.\n Rom 5:20 The Law came in so that the transgression would increase; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,\n Rom 5:21 so that, as sin reigned in death, even so grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.",

Let's start here: \n Some feel the media has embraced homosexuality because of the theory that it is a genetically inherited condition and is not a matter of choice. This common misperception defies both logic and science. This fictional \"gay gene\" would have been out bredlong ago due to the fact that homosexuals hardly ever have children of their own. Also, this gene would be recessive by definition because t he homosexual lifestyle is too dangerous to be considered biologically beneficial . Yet instead, the homosexual population has not been stagnant or diminishing, but has rather grown rapidly. \n \n Many homosexuals speak of homosexuality as a learned reaction of either being abused as a child, or being seduced. One homosexual explained that, \"In Gay radicalism I met a large stream of desire that disarmed and seduced me...\". Many feel it is a learned reaction and a choice one makes. Please feel free to read some of the material below, email, or call DFL to discuss these points and/or to seek assistance.\n http://www.doctorsforlifeinternational.com/issues/homosexual/genetics.cfm",

   "Ask Mel White or Gene Robinson. You were doing fine until you got to this part and stumbled over your anti-religious bias; there was no reason to even bring religion in general into this. After all, there are plenty of homophobes that are far from being religious, and plenty of gay-rights supporting religious people.\n\n \n My dear, it is not I who bring religion into this debate on sexuality, It's your fellow Christians. And yes, I do find that sort of religion -- i.e. bigoted or homophobic -- repugnant, I've never made a secret of that. I also disagree with religious beliefs about a deity, but not all of those are homophobic by any means. However, much homophobic religion likes to pretend that either there is no biological cause of homosexuality, or there is, but it should be resisted, anyway, which is the position of the Vatican mafia. But I guess if gay men are intrinsically evil and disordered by virtue of their biology, then so are women... oh, wait, that has been the Vatican position all along, hasn't it, my dear, and it's rooted in even more ancient Judaic misogyny about the uncleanliness of women. It's not as though the Vatican regards women very highly, anyway.\n \n As for non-religious homophobes, yes, I suppose there is one, once in a blue moon. Most, however, quote religion as their excuse for bigotry, and in the West, most of those are Christian.\n \n What I like about research of this sort is how it cuts the ground from underneath the feet of religious bigots -- you know, the ones Kronus accurately characterised as the Adam-and-Steve crowd, the self-inflicted ignorati. They like to blame gays for being gay, so they can gleefully announce their god will punish gay people for evil choices, but this attitude is completely untenable -- at least by reasoning people -- these days.\n \n After all, if god had intended homosexuality to be evil, he wouldn't have made gays in the first place, right, as that would have been a cruel infliction? And you do claim your god is directly responsible for all biological phenomena, right? And you also claim your god is not cruel, right? You folk claim your god does no evil, after all, so how can homosexuality be evil if it is perfectly natural and god-breathed?\n \n I suggest if you have a problem with religious homophobia, you address its religious roots, rather than pretending it doesn't exist. Being gay is a perfectly natural variation in human nature. It doesn't really even matter why it exists: it does, it does no harm, and so should be accepted without reservation.",

   "First of all Jason, no you haven't asked ME repeatedly why God made people gay if they're wrong. Because I would have answered you easily. And the answer is simply this, It's the result of the fallen nature of Man. Homosexuality is an aberration of human sexuality that has been shown in tests to possibly be caused by a deficiency of certain vitamins in pregnant women. The results of that scientific research has been discussed here on 4forums, and if accurate would result in the brain anomalies we are seeing described in this article. It would stand to reason that if certain deficiencies in the mother led to homosexuality in the child that the results would show up in the homosexual brain. \n \n So whatever the actual cause for homosexuality, you can be sure that God didn't create you purposely and personally to be that way. The most obvious reason for knowing that being that if God made you homosexual on purpose, He never would have called it an abomination. Just as God didn't create straight men to grow up to be adulterers or fornicators or murderers or rapists. The nature of sin within the human condition is the result of our fall from grace. And that fall makes us all susceptible to any variety of personal and predominant sins. It is the reason that we ALL need the salvation that only comes with knowing Jesus Christ personally. Whatever predominant sins afflict us, they aren't the result of how God created us, but are the result of the fall from grace and the sinful nature we inherited from Adam. And here is the scriptural evidence that this isn't just my opinion, but is the biblical explanation for the reason that sin/death exists in the human experience.\n \n 1Cr 15:21 For since by a man {came} death, by a man also {came} the resurrection of the dead.\n 1Cr 15:22 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.\n \n \n \n Rom 5:12 Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned--\n Rom 5:13 for until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law.\n Rom 5:14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come.\n Rom 5:15 But the free gift is not like the transgression. For if by the transgression of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many.\n Rom 5:16 The gift is not like {that which came} through the one who sinned; for on the one hand the judgment {arose} from one {transgression} resulting in condemnation, but on the other hand the free gift {arose} from many transgressions resulting in justification.\n Rom 5:17 For if by the transgression of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.\n Rom 5:18 So then as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men.\n Rom 5:19 For as through the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous.\n Rom 5:20 The Law came in so that the transgression would increase; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,\n Rom 5:21 so that, as sin reigned in death, even so grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\n \n \n So you still give no reason to why homosexuality is present in over 1500 species, you still give your interpetation of the bible quoting scripture when some here dont see it as factual evidence, and furthermore you quote vitamin defieicncy in pregnant women as the cause of homosexuality??

Thanks for the change in the way you're referring to what you're talking about.\n\n \n It's not merely an empty claim to point out a strong, positive correlation between religious belief and homophobia. Religions such as Christianity and Islam are particularly prone to it, for all that there exist SOME Christians and Muslims who either gladly accept their gay sexuality, or do not assume that their god condemns what their god has created, just because it's possible to read that silliness into their scripture.\n \n I'm simply pointing out the inconsistency in many religious beliefs about gay people. I've never claimed that to be religious is to be homophobic, and you know it. Just because I do not specify that in every single post that you happen read doesn't mean to say I've made any such implication.\n \n However, religion is prima facie evidence of irrational thinking at work, but even rational preople are sometimes prone to irrational thoughts. There is lots of evidence for this drawback to religious thinking, and not only in social policy with respect to human sexuality. You get the same degree of religiously inspired ignorance in topics such as human evolution.\n \n Once religion is involved, common sense all too frequently seems to go right out the window.

   "What religious believers in general should ponder, in my humble view, is a question along these lines:\n \n If their god designed human brains, as most of them seem to want to claim, then did he make a mistake with gay brains, or was this an intentional design?\n \n Of course, they could always attempt the cop-out that they cannot know what their god intended, but alas, that really won't wash either, because lots of them spend a lot of their time telling other people what god's intentions are. Curiously, god's intentions always seem to correspond to the bias of the believer. Strange how that works.\n \n Religious believers who accept Darwinian evolution, with all its metaphysical implications about the absence of intentional design, aren't going to be bothered much by homosexuality... they will likely treat it simply as a variation in human nature, no more cosmically significant than hair colour or handedness, which exists simply because it can exist (or maybe because it confers reproductive fitness on populations that harbour such variations).

   "Now, although I believe that the biology of homosexuality is relevant to gay rights, I don't want to make a hard Darwinian claim for the fitness of homosexuality as an innate trait. There are arguments for and against it. Still, its prevalence in human and other vertebrate species is remarkable, especially for those people who would dearly like to assume that it must have negative fitness. Since it persists despite naive expectations it should be bred out, then either: (1) it has no deleterious consequences for the gene pool within which it resides (it exists just because it can exist), or (2) any deleterious consequences are more than offset by adaptive advantages to kin, or (3) it has a positive selective value. This scientific question is not resolved by any study to date, but it remains an important one.\n \n As a result of scientific study of this question since about the turn of the last century, it makes no sense any more to regard it as \"unnatural\", or even remotely undesirable or unhealthy. Science has pulled the rug out from under those, popular though they have been in religious circles. The only reason it might be regarded as undesirable today is because it breaks social or religious taboos or expectations, and then the question arises of whether the taboos and expectations are more important than the well-being of gay human beings.\n \n Now, it's up to those with a social or religious bias against gay people to justify it, and the only way they can do so is not by quoting, misquoting, or selectively excerpting their holy scriptures, but by demonstrating the harm caused by allowing gay people to live in peace and mutual respect with straight people.",
