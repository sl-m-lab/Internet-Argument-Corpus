Here's why: Evolutionists assume that there is nothing that needs to be taken on faith and Creationists dismiss all scientific evidence of evolution.\n\n That's just not true. \"Evolutionists\" do not assume that there is nothing that needs to be taken on faith. Since the study of evolution is part of evolutionary biology, and biology is a science, it works by using the scientific method. Science tries to explain observations of natural phenomena and events with natural explanations. The explanations (hypotheses) are tested because they are predictive. If a prediction is supported by the tests (experiments), then the explanation is a scientific theory. I wonder why it is that creationists always think that evolution requires faith but never think so about chemistry, physics, astronomy, geology and other sciences. \n \n From your site:\n \nAlthough you can point to evidence for evolution and natural selection, there are still facts that you have to take on faith. For example, even a single cell is incredibly complex and no one has been able to create a cell purely from atomic components.\n\n Did it not occur to you that you should make sense? Exactly how is it a matter of faith that cells are complex and have not been created from atomic components? And yet you tell us that this is an example of facts taken on faith.\n \n By the way, two viruses and a bacterium have been created by assembling the strands of RNA and DNA from components. They all worked. The viruses reproduced (there are differing opinions about whether viruses are living), as did the bacterium.",

   "The objective frame of measurement from which we gather this data indicates that that is nonsensical banter from cosmologists with too little to do.\n \n\n \n It seems apparent that you have a poor understanding of modern cosmological models, what with you attempting to overlay Euclidean geometry onto the universe. General Relativity's basis is non-euclidean geometry. And yet you feel qualified to pass judgment on theoretical physicists who have spent their entire careers studying the matter by saying \"that is nonsensical banter from cosmologists with too little to do\".\n \n I have never understood that attitude. If my understanding of a subject disagrees with the consensus view of the \"experts\" on that subject, my reaction is to figure out what I am misunderstanding about the subject, and not assume that all the experts are wrong and that I, Birdan, have some keen insight that thousands of people over several decades have missed. I don't think that the lack of such hubris is a character flaw, btw.\n \n \nYou say a small volume, yet a volume cannot be a point unless it is zero.\n\n \n I say a \"small volume\" because the current cosmological model breaks down at about t = 10^-35 sec. (iirc) towards the beginning, at which time the universe WAS a small volume.\n \n \nFurther we know that the universe is expanding because we note that the distance between matter is expanding.\n \n If 'space time' is what is expanding how can we measure this expansion spatially?\n \n Why do we observe increasing distances?\n\n \n We don't observe increasing distances, we observe increasing velocities the farther away the objects are.\n \n \nThis all implies that the universes expansion is not an expansion of space itself, but that matter is expanding through space.\n \n If the universe is 10 meters wide now and 12 meters wide tomorrow then we are saying that it was .0000001 meters wide some time ago in the past.\n \n The center of the universe is the geometric center of the shape encompassing all matter.\n \n Something cannot spatially expand without spatial coordinates, the origin of expansion is a point within the universe.\n\n \n No, you misunderstand the model. Let's say that I am at point A and I observe object 1 is 3 miles distant and moving away from point A at 3 miles / hour, object 2 is 5 miles distant and moving away from point A at 5 miles / hour, and object 3 is 10 miles distant and moving away from point A at 10 miles / hour. Then can I not conclude that one hour ago all three objects were at point A? \n \n Now here is the crucial part: I move to point B and I make the same exact observations about the distances and velocities of objects 1, 2, and 3, relative to point B. I can also conclude, at point B, that one hour ago all three objects were at point B.\n \n And that is a rough analogy of what astronomical observations say: the further away an object is, the faster it is moving. AND these objects are all moving away from each other (past a certain level of gravitational attraction) AT THAT SAME DISTANCE / VELOCITY RATIO. That is NOT explainable by 'matter' expanding in space, but IS explainable by space itself expanding.\n \n Another classic analogy - Take the two dimensional surface of a balloon. Draw several dots on the balloon. Now begin blowing the balloon up and you will see all the dots moving away from each other and the further away the dots are, the faster they are moving away from each other (as measured along the 2 dimensional surface of the balloon). If you imagine the balloon to originally be the size of a pea, then all points on the balloon's surface were at one time within that \"pea volume\". Now imagine the size of the original balloon to be that of a grain of sand, or the head of a pin, or ..... \n \n The above is based on the 2 dimensional surface of a balloon whereas the universe has three spatial dimensions, which we cannot visualize.

   "I am afraid that is not an answer, you merely restated the premise that the observed speed of light is a constant.\n\n Actually, it is the answer. But you misunderstand. The speed of light is not constant. It varies according to the medium through which it travels. If light strikes a surface between two different translucent media, it is refracted (bent) by an amount that can be calculated by the known properties of those media. Thus, if you stick a straight pole into water, it appears to bend at the water's surface. Thus, the science of optics upon which eyeglasses, contact lenses, telescopes and binoculars depend.\n \n And there is something known as Cherenkov radiation that is a blue glow emitted when charged particles travel through an insulator at speeds greater than the speed of light in that medium. The prime example is the blue glow emitted by a nuclear reactor in water. Charged particles from the fission reaction travel through the water insulator at velocities greater than that of light through water.\n \n And, of course, the observed speed of light has never exceeded the established and measured value of c. The speed of light from light emitting objects that are approaching us at any fraction of the speed of light is never been observed to exceed c (which is 286,000 miles per second). What is observed is that the light is blue shifted (I seriously doubt that you know what the means - it doesn't mean that the light is blue). It is also observed that objects that are moving away from us are red shifted.\n \n It was the red shifting of distant stellar objects that Hubble documented that convinced Einstein that his idea of a steady state universe was wrong and caused him to declare that his cosmological constant was the greatest blunder of his career.\n \n Of course the \"red shifting\" or \"blue shifting\" does not refer to the color of the light. It refers to the adsorption or emission lines in the spectrum that are caused by the chemical elements in the light source. It is these lines that are shifted - towards the blue if the object is approaching, and towards the red if it is moving away. But the speed of light through the vacuum of space, whether the object is moving towards us or away from us, is always the same.\n \n By the way, this is analogous to the Doppler effect in relation to sound. The speed of sound varies according to the temperature, density, and humidity of the air. The maximum speed of sound at sea level through dry air is about 768 mph. If you measure the speed of a sound reaching your ears under constant conditions, the speed is always the same but the frequency is higher if the source is approaching, and lower if it is moving away. If you listen to a train or a car pass you as it is blowing its horn, the tone will go from higher to lower as it passes you. While the speed of the sound through the air is constant, the frequency is higher if the source is approaching, and lower as it moves away.\n \n Stating that the observed speed of light (in a vacuum) is always the same is not a premise. It is a fact. Light has never been observed to exceed Einstein's calculation.\n \n No matter what you may believe the case to be, if you fail to understand the physics of the problem, then your opinion is nothing more than flatulence.\n \n In short, it doesn't matter how fast an object is approaching us or moving away, the speed of light from that object never exceeds c (nor does it fall below c in a specific meduim). It is the frequency of the light that changes, just as the frequency of sound changes as it approaches and then passes us and moves away.",

   "\n Relative time dilation (or distance contraction/expansion) is the crux of the theory from what I have heard and understood.\n \n\n \n No, its only a consequence of the theory. The crux is the simple statement that physics is always the same no matter what state of uniform motion you are in. All of the popular aspects of the theory (time dilation, length contraction, relativity of simultaneity) must fall into place if you accept this simple premise. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n When we say the speed of light is constant we mean at the moment of interaction the velocity relative to the interactor is always the same.\n \n\n And any other time at any point in the universe. This is why we know how far back in time we are looking when we observe light from distant objects. We may observe events that the light conveys as slowed down, but the time the light took to reach us is always the (distance of origin) / 186,000mi/s.\n \n \n\n Well it was an example but if you are asking if I stand by it yes I do.\n \n \n Eh, what paradox?\n \n\n You said two objects can close on each other at 1.99c. You created a scenario where relative speed is faster than light which is mathematically impossible. Therefore, if your reasoning is correct, you created a hypothetical paradox. I am trying to fill in gaps in your reasoning. \n \n \n\n I believe that time dilation and length contraction are two sides of the same coin.\n \n\n Not exactly. Have you ever asked how two observers approaching each other can both claim that the other is running slow? Or why if you travel at near c and return more time will have passed on Earth than you have experienced, but then wonder why, if everything is relative, doesn't the Earth have the right to claim that it traveled away from you and then returned and it should have aged less than you.\n \n If you can clear this up in your head and make it all make sense, then you may be getting somewhere with all of this. Otherwise, you should be asking questions instead of arguing.\n \n \n \n\n In essence we are saying that since c is constant and c is a velocity and velocity = d/t either d or t change to 'counteract' relativity.\n\n Maybe...again, you have to be careful what you say when you are talking about the consequences of relativity. Your not changing a value, you are measuring it from a frame of reference. It's easy to make an intelligible statement that is wrong. Avoid statements like, \"length is really this,\" \"\"it actually took this long\" or \"this event was really first but he saw it as last.\" If you observe something to be true, it is true. If someone else observe a different truth, it's still true! (to them, but just as true as your observation is to you)\n \n \n \nSome people like to think of time changing or distance changing. I think time is easier to think about. \n\n Its either one or the other. You can't pick and choose. Each is a result of a special situation. They are not the same coin.",

At the same time the light is emitted, object X passes point A towards B at .99c. As the light and then object X pass object B, object B will conclude that object X is moving at .01c relative to the light. \n \n \n My point above is that this is not a problem because we also see object X's clocks running slow and different distances in the direction object X and the light is traveling relative to what object X would see.

Just like it doesn't matter if the sound from a train blowing its horn is approaching you or moving away from you, the sound from that horn is passing you at the speed of sound.\n\n Sound is fundamentally different from objects moving at relativistic speeds, the analogy to sound is made when one is trying to understand the wave nature of light, which as I have said is somewhat irrelevant to GR.\n \n There is no aether for light to travel across (or so science says), which means for all meaningful comparisons about relativity sound is not like light.\n \n For instance the speed of sound in a jet going the speed of sound is the same only in reference to the passengers; it is going 2x or 0x the speed of sound relative to the ground. That is because the medium is moving not because of any relativistic effects on time and space.\n \n \nAnd, sadly, you don't seem to understand.\n\n That you are still talking about frequency without purpose is something I understand.\n \n The last time it would have been relevant was back with the expanding of the universe.",
