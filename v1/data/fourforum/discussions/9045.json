   "A couple people mentioned the problems with labels:\n Pro-choice folks are not anti-life or strictly speakly pro-abortion.\n Some Pro-life folks are not completely against legalizing abortion.\n \n Both labels can be used in both directions for propagandist purposes.\n \n I don't think this would ever happen as both sides are too entrenced, but what do you think would happen to the debate if it was reduced to these two issues:\n \n Pro-legalized abortion (PLA)\n Anti-legalized abortion (ALA)\n \n This pares it down to the real issue. It might reduce the sensationalizing and get people talking. I suppose there would have to be a certain gestational age to agree upon, which might be tough. Many would concede first trimester. I think no one thinks third trimester is OK.\n \n Do you think the debate could be changed to something like this?",

To a militant lifer she becomes nothing more than a pregnancy - her circumstances, reality, voice no longer matter at all. You gag her, trivailize whatever may be going on in her life a well as the physical, emotional and financial realities of pregnancy, and demonize her if she can't embrace motherhood for any reason short of her immenent death.",
