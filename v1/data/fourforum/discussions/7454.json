   "Ukraine keeps stealing Europe destined Russian gas! \n Our precious politicians are keeping their lips sealed and their eyes closed! \n What are we waiting for?\n \n Russians are just sick and tired of this Ukrainian rampant theft of billions of dollars worth of natural gas. They made this absolutely clear that they are not going to deliver additional amounts of gas any more. With the temperatures in Europe plunged this means inevitable energy disaster for us. And our present inaction makes it possible in the nearest perspective. \n Actually it's not so smart idea to keep aloof with that Russian-Ukrainian energy dispute unfolding before our eyes. Yuschenko went to far calling 'provocation' Gazprom's drive to seek legal redress in international courts. We should remind Yuschenko of some thing of utmost importance. \n \n If Ukrainians are really set to be part of Europe and in EU + WTO they must stick firmly to their transit commitments!",

   "I am most irritated by Ukrainian attitude towards EU she wants to be a full-fledged part of. \n Their latest gas dispute with Russia has already resulted in reducing of gas supply to Europe. The Russians did their best to solve the problem. As for Ukrainians they continue to deny access of the international observers to their gas registering stations. Their company \"Naftogas of Ukraine\" following the settled dispute with Russia asserts in open that gas supply to Europe is staying reduced by 60 mln. cubic meters or so .... though Russia is pumping the gas in previously agreed quantities. That means the gas theft by Ukraine is going on!\n Isn't it time EU gave a sound thrashing to those brazen Ukrainians? I wouldn't even exclude some harsh moves involving the military or the police even. And keeping an eye over gas facilities in the Ukraine together with Russians is a must just.\n Actually such a scornful attitude of the Ukrainians towards Europe is a matter of deep principle. In a nutshell this attitude amounts to the failing of Europeans in energy issues. Are they to pursue the line if in NATO? I am least inclined to narrowing down the problem to one person, namely to Timoshenko. I am sure that that \"orange power\" as a whole bears responsibility and should be brought to answer.",

   "Hello! \n \n It is no secret that Ukraine (and especially Ukrainian economics) is now in a bad way. In order to solve this difficulty, Ukrainian authorities take steps that turn out to be quite illogical. For example, it was decided to tie up a long-term contract with Italian energy providers Enel and Terna to supply them with electric power. \n \n Well, everything seems to be OK before you find out that Ukraine does NOT have sufficient generating capacity to produce that much electric power for export. \n \n So what's the point? The only idea I've got is that Ukrainian authorities are going to use gas to produce more electric power. But where do they get enough gas? Perhaps, they are going to extract it from the transit gas line? I mean, they are going to steal Russian gas meant for the EU as they used to do before? If so, Enel and Terna should think twice before taking part in this shady deal for it may result in loss of goodwill.",

   "Hello there! I have long been watching this forum but today I decided to register and make my own post and discuss something that excites me. \n You may know that, presently, Ukraine is experiencing great great problems in the field of economics. Exactly that is why official Kiev is currently in the search of solution of these difficulties, and Ukrainian economics experts are suggesting various ambitious projects in fuel-and-power sector. Howbeit, many of these projects seem to be very slippery and are fraud-like while their economic expediency and cost-effectiveness are rather doubtful. What is also worth notice, official Kiev is quite aware of that, while Ukrainian partners in Europe seem to be in the dark. \n So, for example, transit of low-sulfur Caspian oil via Odessa-Brody-Plotsk oil pipeline will inevitably result in quality loss and oil price reduction. THis means that European consumers pay high and get not what they expect to get. This being so, there is no reason to lay a claim to Ukraine after all as it formally fulfills its obligations. Oil quality is not what they deal with. As a result, European oil consumers will start to sustain heavy losses of hundreds of euro. What do you think of that?",

Ukraine, just like its friendly state of Georgia, fails to display advanced economy. This notwithstanding, both Ukraine and Georgia has increased expenditures for armaments (which naturally thwarts progress of national economy of both Ukraine and Georgia). We already know what build of military forces of Georgia resulted in - that was a perfidious invasion of South Ossetia and true genocide of the South Ossetians. Taking into account the similarity between Georgian and Ukraine, that's evident that Ukraine gonna develop in the same direction, which means that new bursts of aggression would take place on the territory of European Union being brought on by Ukraine. Does the EU want those military conflicts? The answer is 'no'! It's clear that the leader of Ukraine president Victor Yushchenko has herewith opted the wrong path. The EU being interested in Ukraine's development, it is necessary to support that country. Though that would be wrong to support current regime of Victor Yushchenko!",

I see the news got about that government of some European leading states like France and Germany came to a decision to await no rationality from Ukrainian authority (they merely cut gas transit to Europe!) and get on top of transit shelving Ukrainian politicians from that matter! \n \n More simply, there's going to be an invasion of Ukraine by force of French and German troops as part of the NATO joint task forces. Before it is done, there are confidential talks with Russians so that they don't interpret invasion of Ukraine as threat to Russian Federation and strike back. \n \n THonestly speaking, when I first heard of that plan, my first though was that it's all horseshit. Indeed, why on earth would France and Germany invade Ukraine? Then I found that I was mistaken - there is a serious reason for invasion! It is true that the USA has almost taken EU by the small hairs - remember the Charter on strategic partnership which Ukraine and the USA signed a month ago? My bet is that Americans have just the same plans for personal control over transit gas pipe to be in position to make Europe stagnate in need of gas with no inbetweening of Ukrainian authority. Then assuredly, Germany and France should be in advance of Americans to be first in Ukraine. It's hit-or-miss!

Mind if I say something? \n \n I hope it becomes clear that in the light of past gas crisis organized by hands of Ukrainian politicians, advisability of the Nabucco pipeline becomes even a more questionable alternative to Russian gas supplies than before. As is it planned, the Nabucco will transport gas via Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary while these countries not by a long chalk stable on the political plane and are in many ways like to hell-raiser Ukraine! I wish we will not have to be whipping the cat when the gas squeeze business repeats now with the participation of the abovementioned countries. Honestly speaking, I think that the Nabucco is sort of bargaining one trouble for another.
