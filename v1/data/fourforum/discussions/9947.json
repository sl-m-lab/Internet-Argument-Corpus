   "What makes any of these three more valid then the others?\n\n \n Nothing. Nothing whatsoever. \n \n A little interesting trivia: Manicheanism was, at its height, one of the most widespread religions in the world (from as far east as hina, and as far west as the Roman empire). It really is too bad that it was seen as such a threat and persecuted Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and later, Islam. It is really quite an interesting religion, much more so I think than Christianity or Islam - I recommend that everyone reading this checks it out to see what it was about - it HAS been revived under the name Neo-Manicheanism.",
