   "I'm starting this thread so as not to further derail the 'respecting beliefs' discussion. I hope Easyrider will participate as he was the principle objector to my reasoning.\n \n The specific situation under discussion was Judas's betrayal of Jesus, for which Judas is allegedly burning in the deepest pit of hell. The twist is, his betrayal was supposedly prophesised a thousand years earlier, and was a necessary part of god's plan for christianity. To my mind, this makes his punishment at best meaningless and at worst entirely unjust.\n \n EZ's response was to point out that \"Foreknowledge by God does not necessarily equate to predeterminism\", meaning that to foresee something is not necessarily to cause it.\n \n Whilst this is clearly true, and in most situations would absolve the precog of responsibility (though not in the case of god and Judas, as we shall see), it rather misses the point, which is that the existence of foreknowledge implies predeterminism.\n \n I gave the counter-example of me watching someone else throw a ball. From the moment it leaves his hand I can fortell where it will land, because no free agents are involved. However, if I were able to predict where the ball would land before it was thrown, that would imply that the man I was watching had no choice of how - or even if - to throw it. I am not necessarily causing the outcome, but my ability to predict it implies predeterminism. The man may even believe he has a free choice, but he clearly does not.\n \n EZ's response, to which I will reply and continue the discussion:\n \n \nIf I supernaturally foreknow what you do tomorrow, then how have I caused what you do? See what's wrong with your thinking?\n\n \n So far as I can tell, EZ, there isn't anything wrong with my thinking, there is only your continued failure to apprehend it. I would ask that you explicitly acknowledge the distinction I am making above, between causing an event and implying its inevitability. That done, I would invite you to further consider the following variation:\n \n If you not only supernaturally foretell what I do tomorrow, but observe that I - an otherwise law-abiding person - am driven to commit a crime as a direct result of an intervention of yours (in Judas's case, god's sending of Jesus to earth), where does the responsibility for that crime lie? I have no chance of avoiding my fate; your ability to predict it demonstrates that fact - and your intervention is what made the difference. Is it right and just for you to sit back, watch events unfold, and then punish me?",

   "It is a paradox, within Christianity. There's no doubt about that.\n\n \n *slumps back in his seat*\n \n Thankyou. Phew!\n \n \nHowever, we're back to yet another case where religion and reason don't go together so well. in many cases they do, but of course in a forum such as this where there are skeptics, naturally the 'contradictions' get more \"airtime\" than the cases where reason and religion work well together. Perhaps I should start a thread about such cases.\n\n \n I hear what you're saying, and religions do express some rational ideas. But we don't need religion in order to be rational. Nor do we need religion in order to be moral, insofar as morality towards one another is concerned (I'll debate this in another thread, if you like; I'd prefer to stay on topic here). Religion's unique contribution to society appears to be steadfast irrationality, both in its teachings and as a prerequisite for faith. Is that good? Personally I don't see how it can be.\n \n Applying this to the topic in hand, my goal here was to contrast the rational response to discovering a paradox with the religious one - with your able assistance of course! \n \n The rational response solves the problem immediately, offering two possible alternatives (even if one of them isn't terribly appealing). By further inspecting the evidence in light of these solutions, we find that the early christian evangelists had means, motive and opportunity to contrive the fulfilment of OT prophecy, and that Matthew at least had 'previous'. Means: they were almost uniquely literate. Motive: to alleviate any personal doubts but more importantly to make Jesus more likely to be accepted by others. Opportunity: details of Jesus's early life were sketchy, not widely known and thus easily adjusted by his biographers. Previous: Matthew can be observed misquoting OT prophecy elsewhere to make his message more palatable to his audience, and making very tenuous connections between prophecy and events in an attempt to tick as many boxes as possible.\n \n Yes, it's 'just' a hypothesis, but it's not a crazy, illogical, paradoxical or even especially unlikely one. As a candidate for what actually happened, it wins hands down against the 'no free will' alternative, let alone the fuzzy, religious, let's-pretend-logic-sometimes-just-doesn't-apply non-explanation.\n \n I want to emphasise that you wouldn't always respond to a paradox the same way. The religious response is triggered because the source of the paradox is behind the god-wall of inviolate belief. These things cannot be wrong; they just can't. And as Mr Holmes proverbially said: once we eliminate the impossible...\n \n \nWell, I make no apologies for the fact that with me, reason and faith are not juxtaposed and work together well from my perspective.\n\n \n Naturally. Reason is a process, operating on whatever assumptions you make and deriving conclusions. Faith is a set of assumptions. A bunch of unjustified and unassailable assumptions can still have reason applied to them, but it does follow the principle of garbage in, garbage out. You 'rationally'* conclude from the christian paradox that logic cannot always apply - and you are perfectly happy and satisfied with that conclusion, monstrous and treacherous and self-invalidating though it is, because in your mind it is preferable to questioning your assumptions.\n \n Now I can almost hear EZ revving up to say that I'm starting from the assumption that the bible is false. Wrong: I'm merely not starting from the assumption that it must be true. Everything is on the table; nothing is sacred. I examine the alternative solutions of the christian paradox and pick the most likely one, which happens to be that the fulfilment of prophecy was faked. There's nothing perverse, mean or prejudiced about that conclusion - I didn't arrive at it based upon my opinions about religion; quite the reverse: my opinions about religion have been informed by just this kind of analysis.\n \n *I qualified 'rationally' in quotes because by cherry-picking certain assumptions as exempt from scrutiny, you are hamstringing your ability to 'be rational' in the sense of deriving useful conclusions - as well as the cherry-picking itself being baseless and therefore irrational.",

Just as some skeptics put up a wall in assuming religion can do no good no matter how much their shown the good it does.) You make no allowance for the possibility that religious people actually weigh the evidence for both sides, and decided that the religious view was the best more sensible course of action. I find that I have to say this often here, but the idea that religion and reason are always juxtaposed is simply a falsehood. I would suggest rather than starting with conclusions about religious people that you actually meet some; I think you'll find they've thought through matters a lot more than you think, and that many of them are actually quite open-minded. I see your view a lot among atheists, and I always try to encourage folks like yourself (who I believe mean well) to get out and interact with religious people rather than making assumptions. Try visiting a seminary sometime, or read some works by noted Christian scholars like Francis Schaffer, Bonhoeffer, Karl Barth, and C.S. Lewis. There are quite a few people who have written about the journey they've taken, that didn't involve a \"wall.\" They came to truly different conclusions than you have. The existence of a paradox doesn't mean that the subject can't exist. It means simply, that there's a paradox. Heck, we have paradoxes in science and nature. We don't throw out the concept of time because of the paraoxes involved.\n \n That said, you're preaching to the choir in saying that faith does not depend on or require reason. It never has, nor do it's proponents want it to. That's not a sign of a weak mind or inferior system, it's just a different way of thinking. SO to some degree I guess there's a \"wall\" though not in the sense that people are closed to other possibilities. They've put the wall there because that WAS the reasonable thing to do. So it does't mean that religious people throw out reason, or block it (as in a wall). For some, reason is WHY they choose religion.

Stalin is often held up as an example of atheist atrocity, but his mindset of unassailable belief in 'something greater than the individual' is indistinguishable from religious fundamentalism.

Just as some skeptics put up a wall in assuming religion can do no good no matter how much their shown the good it does.\n\n \n I'm sure they do. But speaking for myself, if you can demonstrate proof that religion is uniquely beneficial I will certainly factor that into my thinking.\n \n \nYou make no allowance for the possibility that religious people actually weigh the evidence for both sides, and decided that the religious view was the best more sensible course of action.\n\n \n If you re-examine my last post, you'll see that's exactly what I described you as having done.

Please don't.\n \n \nI would suggest rather than starting with conclusions about religious people that you actually meet some; I think you'll find they've thought through matters a lot more than you think, and that many of them are actually quite open-minded.\n\n \n You mean like here?\n \n I'll repeat this as often as you need me to: I'm not saying all religious people aren't thoughtful, and I'm not saying none of them are reasonable. But what they all have in common - what the very definition of faith requires them to have in common - are certain assumptions that they simply will not challenge no matter how absurd the conclusions reason draws from them.\n \n \nThe existence of a paradox doesn't mean that the subject can't exist. It means simply, that there's a paradox.\n\n \n Er... sorry, you've kind of lost me there. What 'subject', and what are you meaning by 'exist'? \n \n \nHeck, we have paradoxes in science and nature. We don't throw out the concept of time because of the paraoxes involved.\n\n \n Again I'm not sure to what you're specifically referring, but to my knowledge we have already drastically modified our scientific understanding of time and indeed the nature of reality on several occasions, often as a result of discovering paradoxes in our existing theories.\n \n \nThat said, you're preaching to the choir in saying that faith does not depend on or require reason. It never has, nor do it's proponents want it to. That's not a sign of a weak mind or inferior system, it's just a different way of thinking.\n\n \n A belief which, conveniently, can never be demonstrated false so long as you adhere to it, since any demonstration of inferiority will necessarily be logical, the supremacy of which the belief itself denies.\n \n \nSO to some degree I guess there's a \"wall\" though not in the sense that people are closed to other possibilities. They've put the wall there because that WAS the reasonable thing to do. So it does't mean that religious people throw out reason, or block it (as in a wall).

There's this wall, though not in the sense of there being a wall as such, and we built this wall around certain beliefs to protect them from reason because it was the reasonable thing to do...\n \n One can only assume that the fact you can think that makes sense and still consider your reason unimpaired is another of those paradoxes where logic just doesn't apply, right?\n \n For (hopefully) the last time: I quite agree that religious people do not 'throw out' reason, or build a wall around it. They build a wall around certain givens, assumptions or axioms and refuse to challenge or modify them, which in turn impairs their reason's ability to reach useful and accurate conclusions. That. Is. Faith.\n \n * If I were pressed to advance a hypothesis, I would draw parallels between christianity and other patriarchal religions that legislate sexual activity and reproduction. Just as the prophecy paradox creates a tension in your mind that can only be released by blaming logic itself, so teaching that desire is sinful when it is merely natural and inevitable creates tensions in religious men which manifest as violence towards, and oppression of, the only element in the equation their beliefs allow them to blame: women.",

If you have to jump through such hoops to make him religious, it makes your stance look pretty shaky. By that logic, I could say that your religion is reason and logic, and those are a religion to you. You've just used the same thinking that critics of atheism use when they call atheism a religion because atheists are \"religiously\" atheistic.

But you've made it clear that your disagreement started with religion, and you are using their supposed 'unassailable belief system' to show weakness. Your argument here has been against religion, not unassailable belief. Let's be clear: unassailable belief is not a religion. It may be a characteristic of some religious people, though. I understand you were trying to head the Stalin rebutal off at the pass, but you've thrown, er, logic out the window to do it.\n \n \nWhat would you say if I were to play your 'get out of logic free' card whenever I found it convenient? \"I'm sorry jyoshu, I know you've proved me wrong but I've decided that I really deeply believe that in this situation logic does not apply.

But you're kidding yourself if you think religion hasn't had a long history of adjusting to science when it finds it's wrong. It's already doing what you think it should be doing. It may not always do it as fast as you'd prefer, but it eventually does. That said, there are some matters of the faith that will not be changed because they are simply not disprovable. You'll never be able to prove God doesn't exist, or that Christ didn't walk the earth. You'll never be able to prove early Christianity was a hoax.\n \n \nAgain I'm not sure to what you're specifically referring, but to my knowledge we have already drastically modified our scientific understanding of time and indeed the nature of reality on several occasions, often as a result of discovering paradoxes in our existing theories.\n\n \n So what do you want religion to do? Drastically modify itself (which it has on the areas that science contradicted it such as an earth-centered universe), or be done away with altogether?\n \n \nWow. Just... wow! There's this wall, though not in the sense of there being a wall as such, and we built this wall around certain beliefs to protect them from reason because it was the reasonable thing to do...\n \n One can only assume that the fact you can think that makes sense and still consider your reason unimpaired is another of those paradoxes where logic just doesn't apply, right?\n\n \n easy, there's no need for that. I wrote that in a hurry and unfortuately didn't compose a very good thought there. You said yourself earlier that we were getting verbose and you didn't have much time--I should have followed your lead and not responded until I had time to compose a good post. I'll try to make my point clearer...\n \n I agree that when it comes to evidence, there are \"walls\" of sorts that pretty much all religious people have. But usually only on matters that aren't disprovable. And given that, I don't see why it's a problem. Read on and I'll elaborate as I further respond to your points . . .\n \n \nFor (hopefully) the last time: I quite agree that religious people do not 'throw out' reason, or build a wall around it. They build a wall around certain givens, assumptions or axioms and refuse to challenge or modify them, which in turn impairs their reason's ability to reach useful and accurate conclusions. That. Is. Faith.\n\n \n Sheeesh, why didn't you just call it that begin with?!! Of course I agree that there are unshakable elements to faith (\"walls\"). But most of the time, these are around things that aren't really touchable by science and reason to begin with--the existence of God, for example. The historicity of Christ. Neither of those will ever be conclusively disproven, and you know that. Now there have been cases of bad walls' such as the Scopes trials. But those cases have been the exception and are largely the product of fundamentalism.\n \n \nBut what they all have in common - what the very definition of faith requires them to have in common - are certain assumptions that they simply will not challenge no matter how absurd the conclusions reason draws from them.\n\n \n I'm walking proof that what you say is NOT the case. I am a theistic evolutionist. Because there is evidence for evolution, it becomes clear to me that the process given in the 6 day Genesis creation story is largely figurative. You see? There is no wall there. Now, where I DO have a wall is in a place that reason can't touch anyway--that God is behind the evolution and the way the universe operates. Reason can't disprove that. So in that case reason and faith are not juxtaposed. There is no harm in a wall being placed there. I'm not arguing against the existence of the walls here. I'm arguing that they aren't all bad.\n \n So in summary, I think it's safe to say that we're at an empass here, back to the age-old reality that there are indeed some things that faith isn't going to budge on (or else it wouldn't be faith!), but that it doesn't have to because they are mostly matters that science and reason can't really touch anyway. So on the point of \"walls\" alone, I agree, I just don't agree on the specifics with you. I don't think a.) \"walls\" are necessarily bad; depending on the issue, and b.) religion does indeed do what you're wanting it to do by modifying itself to accomodate scientific and rational changes as we understand more of how the universe works. Again, it may not change as fast as some might like, but it does make those changes. (e.g. change from earth-centered universe, further acceptance over time of evolution by religious people, etc.) These are all the non-crucial matters however when it comes to faith--note that the creeds for example, composed very early on in Christianity to determine where those walls you keep talking about should be placed, say nothing of the need to believe in an earth-centered universe. And the areas of faith that ARE crucial are not disprovable anyway (existence of God, the Son, need for atonement, etc.), so it's not really a problem. So there are issues that are and will always ONLY be issues of faith that reason can't really do much about, and there are issues that reason CAN determine, of which the church has changed accordingly.",

   "Don't you think that's quibbling just a bit?\n\n \n No :) It really does matter whether two correlated factors are causally related, and if so, how. I'm reminded of a study that strongly linked church attendance with better health in the elderly...\n \n \nWow. Just... wow! This is quite a stretch on your part--the bottom line is that Stalin simply wasn't religious.\n\n \n He he! Ok, fair enough, I deserved that first bit; sorry.\n \n My point about Stalin is that although he wasn't a theist or a deist, he most certainly was religious in the sense defined here:\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion\n \n \nIf you were simply arguing in this thread that \"unssailable belief\" in something was bad because it walls off evidence, I might be inclined to agree with you.\n\n \n Now that's very interesting.\n \n \nYour argument here has been against religion, not unassailable belief. Let's be clear: unassailable belief is not a religion.\n\n \n And that's even more interesting.\n \n I had not considered the possibility that you might perceive 'unassailable belief', as you put it, as something seperate; something that religion could be placed next to and distinguished from.\n \n I ask you to consider instead that unassailable beliefs not only define a religion* but define it as a religion. They are both necessary and sufficient. What is christianity without the belief in Jesus as the son of god? Anyone who challenges that belief within themselves and finds it wanting ceases to be a christian. By contrast, a religion with no unassailable beliefs is not a religion at all, but science. Science is what you get when you stop protecting your beliefs behind walls and start hammering them with everything you've got.\n \n \nI think on matters that aren't disprovable, \"playing that card\" is fine. But you're kidding yourself if you think religion hasn't had a long history of adjusting to science when it finds it's wrong. It's already doing what you think it should be doing. It may not always do it as fast as you'd prefer, but it eventually does. That said, there are some matters of the faith that will not be changed because they are simply not disprovable. You'll never be able to prove God doesn't exist, or that Christ didn't walk the earth. You'll never be able to prove early Christianity was a hoax.\n\n \n Never say never :) But I would say 'hoax' is a very pejorative term for the bit of evangelical wishful-thinking I'm proposing to defuse the prophecy paradox. I mean, sure, I can't exclude the possibility that it was a hoax, but I'm not implying a requirement for malice or insincerity.\n \n I strongly disagree with your opening statement, however, about playing the GOOLF card. All sorts of rubbish is undisprovable, and we should not give it a free pass out of politeness.\n \n I also hesitate to entirely endorse your statement that religion has a long history of adjusting to science. Where it has been long, it is because religion dug in its heels, and that 'adjustment' has rarely been painless or bloodless. The 'geocentric' example you give later on is a good one:\n \n http://www.kiva.net/~kls/history.html\n \n Geocentrism was a philosophical deduction, not a scientific one, adopted as official church policy essentially because they liked it. We can clearly see the undesirable side effects of the god-wall in action: an idea that should have been readily and painlessly interchangeable with a better one instead endowed with 'unassailable' status and overturned only after several people endured considerable hardship.\n \n But where your 'evolution of religion' argument really falls down is that the points upon which religion has given ground - globally and without recidivism - are without exception not to be found in its holy texts. Geocentrism was a fad; an addon, and that proved hard enough to eradicate once religion got hold of it. Anything actually written in those blasted little books the Gideons keep leaving behind when they stay in motels keeps popping back up, over and over. We will never be rid of these ideas so long as they are enshrined as scripture, however enlightened your personal interpretation of it might be.\n \n Returning to the so-called 'undisprovable' matters, I get the impression you see this as a pretty distinct line in the sand beyond which reason may not trespass. In reality no such line exists; one would do better to imagine a hemisphere of possibility, with science and reason as a tower built at the apex of that hemisphere. Standing on the tower we cannot ever see all the way around to the very rim, but we can make that tower awfully high, and the likelihood of things existing where we cannot see awfully small.\n \n Recall the 'evil spirits of disease'. Evil spirits are inherently undisprovable, yet we have adjusted to a world without them - and I'd like to think you wouldn't allow me to play the 'get out of logic free' card in defence of their existence, either. Why? Because microscopes gave us an alternative explanation. They didn't disprove anything. The same applies elsewhere: just because something is not entirely (dis)provable doesn't mean we can't attach a level of confidence to our assertion of its (non)existence, even if our evidence is only in favour of alternative explanations.\n \n What I especially like about the evil spirits, though, is that they played fair. When we found bacteria, they said \"It's a fair cop\" and vanished in a puff of logic. They didn't hang around being a metaphor for bacteria, or get redefined to inhabit them somehow. They didn't still claim to be right. What I find disagreeable - even dishonest - about religion is its prideful reluctance to 'fess up. \"Genesis isn't wrong; it's just symbolic, just a metaphor, just figurative.\" No: it's just wrong. It's a bunch of words on a page and what they describe is wrong. You can tell because if you give it to someone who's never been taught anything else about the origin of the universe it will give them the wrong idea. Not even simplified-wrong like junior school textbooks, just plain wrong.\n \n \nSo what do you want religion to do? Drastically modify itself or be done away with altogether?\n\n \n They are one and the same thing. As I've said: a self-rectifying religion is no religion at all, it's science.\n \n \nI agree that when it comes to evidence, there are \"walls\" of sorts that pretty much all religious people have. But usually only on matters that aren't disprovable. And given that, I don't see why it's a problem.\n\n \n It's a problem because - to pick just one tiny reason of many - some utterly absurd proportion of modern American schoolchildren believe in the literal truth of creation as taught in Genesis. Now, you may be comfortable interpreting it as symbolism, but you have the luxury of being exposed to more information. The parents of many of these children not only believe their kids should be taught creationism but that it should be reinstalled behind the god-wall, never to be questioned.\n \n I don't know how better to say it than this: you can't get into this kind of mess without religion. Religion means there is such a thing as the god-wall; it teaches the virtue of having one in your mind, and installing one in the minds of your children and fellow human beings. Sure, you personally might only put fairly innoccuous stuff back there, but that says absolutely nothing about how counterproductive it can be. I just don't see how you can use your enlightened moderation to defend the retention as holy scripture (the term itself doesn't exactly slap you in the face as meaning 'figurative' does it?) of something we know to be false - especially in the face of the current resurgence of creation literalism.\n \n \nNow, where I DO have a wall is in a place that reason can't touch anyway--that God is behind the evolution and the way the universe operates. Reason can't disprove that.\n\n \n I will happily tackle that in another thread, if you like - for now suffice it to say I disagree.\n \n In any case, the fact you chose to install something potentially dangerous where it would do little or no harm does not make the thing itself inherently less dangerous. Who is more likely to accept and retain the wrongheaded literalism of biblical creation: someone with a god-wall, or someone without? Who is more likely to accept, retain, and pass on to his children the belief that the jew, the christian, the muslim or the black man is his enemy?\n \n We should be knocking god-walls down, not building them up in the minds of our children. They are not virtuous in themselves, and they make correcting tragic misapprehensions more difficult.\n \n * In both senses: Religion X's unassailable beliefs define Religion X, and any set of unassailable beliefs defines a religion.",

   "I'm starting this thread so as not to further derail the 'respecting beliefs' discussion. I hope Easyrider will participate as he was the principle objector to my reasoning.\n \n The specific situation under discussion was Judas's betrayal of Jesus, for which Judas is allegedly burning in the deepest pit of hell. The twist is, his betrayal was supposedly prophesised a thousand years earlier, and was a necessary part of god's plan for christianity. To my mind, this makes his punishment at best meaningless and at worst entirely unjust.\n \n EZ's response was to point out that \"Foreknowledge by God does not necessarily equate to predeterminism\", meaning that to foresee something is not necessarily to cause it.\n \n Whilst this is clearly true, and in most situations would absolve the precog of responsibility (though not in the case of god and Judas, as we shall see), it rather misses the point, which is that the existence of foreknowledge implies predeterminism.\n \n I gave the counter-example of me watching someone else throw a ball. From the moment it leaves his hand I can fortell where it will land, because no free agents are involved. However, if I were able to predict where the ball would land before it was thrown, that would imply that the man I was watching had no choice of how - or even if - to throw it. I am not necessarily causing the outcome, but my ability to predict it implies predeterminism. The man may even believe he has a free choice, but he clearly does not.\n \n EZ's response, to which I will reply and continue the discussion:\n \n \n \n So far as I can tell, EZ, there isn't anything wrong with my thinking, there is only your continued failure to apprehend it. I would ask that you explicitly acknowledge the distinction I am making above, between causing an event and implying its inevitability. That done, I would invite you to further consider the following variation:\n \n If you not only supernaturally foretell what I do tomorrow, but observe that I - an otherwise law-abiding person - am driven to commit a crime as a direct result of an intervention of yours (in Judas's case, god's sending of Jesus to earth), where does the responsibility for that crime lie? I have no chance of avoiding my fate; your ability to predict it demonstrates that fact - and your intervention is what made the difference. Is it right and just for you to sit back, watch events unfold, and then punish me?\n\n \n I would like a stab at this. Other arguments, notwithstanding.\n \n Here it is in a nutshell. Foreknowledge does not mean predetermined. That is my position. \n \n I bolded one line up there. I will bring it into play shortly. First we must agree on certain suppositions in order to have a reasonable discussion.\n \n 1) God is the one who created all.\n 2) Prophesies are communications to the people by God.\n 3) Free will is the ability to act in accordance with one's nature.\n 4) People are not God.\n \n For the sake of the topic concerning Judas, these items are assumed to be true with the exception of number three. That item is a matter of definition. Since much of my argument will concern the concept of free will and you have not defined it in the opening I have accepted that burden and provided a definition here. If you wish to take back this burden, you must also argue why your definition is better.\n \n Now on to the argument.\n \n If God is the creator of all things, then he is also the definer of all things. Good and Evil are defined by God. The statement you made (in bold above) says that you actually know what is evil and good. In the garden of eden (and we are already using the bible for purposes of the discussion, If you reject this argument then you make your argument moot) When adam ate the fruit, it was the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The tempter told them that on the day they ate that fruit that they would be like god knowing good and evil. The point here is that it is inappropriate for a human to declare what is good or not good when God has already defined it.\n \n That being said, let us move on more directly to the topic. Foreknowledge does not equal predetermination as that is a very temporal thought. God does not exist bound by time. He may have foreknowledge but that does not mean that Judas did not have free will. Judas still made the choice.\n \n EZ is right in that God did not \"need\" judas to do this. Before and after are simply meaningless in the concept of outside of time. It is difficult for humans to get their head around as we are absolutely bound by time. But, from a mathematical perspective, moving outside of time eliminates the possibility of pre and post. Instead it is as if everything occurs all at once. It is as if you or I are looking down at the desk top. We experience the desktop all at one time. The desk top is in a plane. We exist in three dimensions. We are outside of back and forth. We exist in up and down. (the desk is 3d but I am just considering the plane that is the top of the desk). We exist outside of the plane and therefore the right side of the desk top does not occur \"before\" the left side. They simply are. That taken together with my previous argument about God is God and we are not makes it all the more reasonable that Judas was and is indeed responsible for his actions.\n \n Your concept of free will is temporally locked. It does not allow for the possibility of God. Which, the story you speak of absolutely requires the possibility of God. You cannot reconcile them because you start with competing premises. Your concept of \"predeterminism\" is, by definition, temporally locked. In order to consider the realilties of God look more along the lines of \"outside\" of time.\n \n As for your ball analogy, it is not parallel as it lacks free will and is bound by both time and physics. God is not. He is instead the very definition of those.\n \n EF",

Good to have you on board.\n \n In responding to your post, I'm going to tackle 'free will' first, and then return to the question of morality in another post (time issues; ironically enough) - I hope that's ok.\n \n \nI bolded one line up there.

If you wish to take back this burden, you must also argue why your definition is better.\n\n \n Free will is notoriously difficult to define. The flaw I can see with your attempt is that it could equally well apply to rocks, planets, water... pretty much anything, depending upon what you mean by 'ability'. How likely is something to excercise this 'ability' in your definition? \n \n Consider what happens if we interpret 'ability' as something binding:\n \n \"Free will is the inevitability of acting in accordance with one's nature\"\n \n Now we have something indistinguishable from causal determinism (thank you Master_Shake!). But any other interpretation gives us:\n \n \"Free will is having the option of acting in accordance with one's nature\"\n \n Getting us precisely nowhere. \n \n Clearly 3) does not define free will, it just conceals it within another ill-defined term.\n \n I may not fare any better, but I'll take a stab at it:\n \n 3) Free will is that which, were our lives to have only one possible course from what we perceive as 'now' to their end, we would certainly not possess*.\n \n Is that a reasonable definition?\n \n Your 'god outside time' and 'woodgrain in a desktop' analogy immediately denies any of us free will in the sense I have defined. Our lives are quite literally mapped out from birth till death. It is meaningless to even speak of 'choices' being made in such a life; there are only events and our inevitable responses to them. \n \n Before you disagree, consider any 'choice' someone in such a world makes - could they have chosen differently? Think: the very notion of 'could have' is, as you put it, a temporal one; it implies a time when the outcome was in doubt. But here there is no time, no place, nowhere that the slightest doubt could exist. In the woodgrain of your desktop, there are only certainties.\n \n You talk about me being locked in 'temporal' modes of thought, and ask me to step outside that. But I would say that it is precisely because I successfully am stepping outside temporal thought, and fully exploring the ramifications, that I percieve the static history-sculpture you describe as denying free will.\n \n I do have more, but unfortunately I'm out of time. I will return ASAP.\n \n *Multiple possibilities are necessary, but not sufficient - eg I might not have free will, but my future might depend on the actions of something that does. I'm also aware of the relativistic issues with defining 'now', but a personal 'now' suffices for our purpose; a multitude of personal 'nows' only perceiving each other's personal past, is consistent with both relativity and the possibility of free will.",

   "I had a response to EF typed last night but apparently forgot to post it.\n \n I also object to EF's definition of free will, if for nothing other than the idea that \"following my nature\" might have nothing to do with actual choice. If I am simply an automaton \"following my 'nature'\" (a.k.a. programming), where is my free will? Peeling clearly worded it more effectively.\n \n However, my initial thoughts on the Boethian resolution lead me to think that it has at least a chance. Of course, wrapping one's brain around the idea of timelessness is not exactly a walk in the park; we've been conditioned our whole lives to understand time as constant (doh, relativity) and unidirectional (doh, quantum mechanics(?)), and I'm still trying to contemplate the ramifications of anything being timeless, if possible. Approaching it as just another dimension seems to bode well for Boethius in concept, but I can't come up with an analogy that doesn't seem flawed...\n \n Will continue mulling.",

   "Upon much further reflection, I would like to refine my argument.\n \n Thinking it over this weekend, it at first seemed there was a compromise solution to reconcile prophecy and free will. You can imagine my dismay!\n \n However, this reconcilliation proved short-lived.\n \n What got me thinking in the first place was the notion of 'god-time', which is most easily explained by asking you to imagine me running a computer simulation of a football match. \n \n The entities within the simulation live in sim-time. I can pause or fast-forward sim-time, even view a graph depicting the simulation's entire life-cycle. If I have a fast enough computer, it can evaluate the entire evolution of the simulation more or less instantaneously as far as I'm concerned. Clearly I am 'outside' sim-time; I can see everything that happens as a static 'sculpture' - yet it is a sculpture created by creatures with free will.\n \n Uh oh!\n \n However, being outside sim-time does not make me truly timeless. My creation of the simulation and my interactions with it occur in a sequence, that sequence in turn representing the passage of time for me, henceforth referred to as 'god-time' (me being the god in this particular analogy)*.\n \n At this point, it's worth repeating my definition of free will:\n \n \nFree will is that which, were our lives to have only one possible course from what we perceive as 'now' to their end, we would certainly not possess.\n\n \n Applying this definition to the entities in my simulation has profound implications for the nature and limitations of my 'foreknowledge'.\n \n For example, say I create my simulation and evaluate the first half of the match. Pow, instantly the first forty-five minutes of play are there for me to inspect, all the result of free-willed entities. The history-sculpture is half-formed.\n \n However, I cannot extrapolate from what I see what will happen in the second half. Proof: if I could, it would be because there was only one possible course for the simulation to take, which implies no free will for the entities within it.\n \n Only by running the whole simulation and zipping possibility into certainty can I have the entire ninety minute sculpture in front of me. That history is now what happened; even though I'm outside sim-time, there was still a 'god-time' when the simulation had not been run, and now it has. I have no foreknowledge, only knowledge. \n \n What I know from looking at the finished sculpture would seem like foreknowledge to an entity in the early stages of the simulation, but that's no more profound than saying that my knowledge of the outcome of a football match, based on watching a video of it, would seem like foreknowledge if I could somehow communicate it to a player before the kickoff.\n \n Clearly I can't do that in real life. But can I do it with my simulation, over which I have total dominion?\n \n No. According to our definition of free will, what I'm looking at is not the only history that could have happened. This means that if I revert the simulation to half-time and instruct it to evaluate the second period again, the history it produces will be different. Proof: if it did the same thing every time, we are back to only one possible course for the simulation to take, and no free will.\n \n Similarly, observing the result of the match and inserting prophecy of those events earlier in the simulation would necessarily trigger just such an unpredictable re-evaluation.\n \n The only way my prophecy can actually correlate with subsequent events, therefore, is if I keep re-running the simulation or interfering elsewhere until events happen to coincide with my prophecy. This clearly makes a mockery of 'free will' and puts the responsibility for whatever happens in that 'selected' history squarely on my shoulders.\n \n Translating our analogy to the universe as a whole, we can see that although it's reasonable for god to create the universe and punish those who misbehave of their own free will - even (maybe) reasonable for him to insert Jesus and punish those who fail to accept him, he cannot insert prophecy into our history and have those predictions come true unless he actively denies us the ability to avoid fulfilling them. He is inescapably bound by his own decision to give us free will.\n \n *The proof of the existence of god-time, given a creator god, is simple: if he created the universe, there was a 'god-time' when he was alone, and then a 'god-time' when both he and the universe existed. If he were truly timeless, then he and the universe would have coexisted forever, and he could not be credited with its creation.",

Even if we accept that we have no free will and our reactions are mechanical, they would still be different in a universe containing prophecy than in the universe that informed that prophecy. God would still have to fine-tune the way he introduced his prophecy so as to avoid disturbing what he foresaw, and thus yield the 'right' result a thousand years later. That fine tuning places the responsibility for those events squarely on his shoulders.\n \n \nNow we get back to God time.

It is vanishingly unlikely that anything remotely similar to the events prophesised would recur. God would have to try almost innumerable times to achieve correlation between prophecy and events a millenium later. Not that the god we hypothesise would be incapable of such a feat - the significance is in the requirement for him to try, and in trying shoulder the responsibility for reproducing prophecy.\n \n The clincher, for me at least, is what happens if you remove the requirement for free will, but keep prophecy.\n \n Now, prophecy can be genuine prediction.

To preserve free will we must exclude this possibility from the outset.\n \n What remains is prophecy based upon inspection of the history-sculpture: observation of what we 'ended up doing'. God observes, and feeds that information back into the universe at an 'earlier' stage.\n \n Here lies the more subtle paradox: if we have free will, and god alters the history sculpture, the changes that propagate from that point are every bit as unpredictable as the universe sculpture's original form. It is vanishingly unlikely that anything remotely similar to the events prophesised would recur. God would have to try almost innumerable times to achieve correlation between prophecy and events a millenium later. Not that the god we hypothesise would be incapable of such a feat - the significance is in the requirement for him to try, and in trying shoulder the responsibility for reproducing prophecy.\n \n The clincher, for me at least, is what happens if you remove the requirement for free will, but keep prophecy.\n \n Now, prophecy can be genuine prediction. God can extrapolate the future and see what will happen. But what he extrapolates is necessarily the future of a world without the prophecy in it. In introducing the prophecy he will inevitably alter the future - unless he deliberately seeks a way of introducing the prophecy that preserves its accuracy.\n \n The conclusion seems inescapable: if, in the final, 'real' history of everything prophecy is fulfilled then it is because god willed it so.\n\n \n \n I think I am actually in agreement on everything except one item. The definition of prophecy as true prediction. I would rather say that it is what is already from the God POV. It is what is to come from the human POV. It does not eliminate free will but rather builds upon it. Free will is necessary for the end game. \n \n There are things that will come about based on prophecy. There is a place in the new testament (can't remember the specific reference, I will try for it later) where it says that God prepared good works for me before I was that I may walk in them. This particular scripture leaves open the possibility that I may not. They will not necessarily come about. They were prepared for me. But it is my choice to take or leave them.\n \n Prophecy is a bit of a different story. I will think more on what you have written and give a better reply. I do think we have consensus on much at this point.emoticon_xhoho",

The entities within it act, within the bounds of their nature of course, with free will, and together work to form a static 4D 'history sculpture'. Since their time is not god's time, from his perspective the whole thing springs into existence as one. He can observe events which are in the future of entities 'earlier' in the sculpture, and in that sense know their future.\n\n \n Your question, \"does killing god restore free will\" therefore isn't really the right one, because it's not god's existence that denies free will. The point is that if we do have free will, god has to circumvent it in order to contrive the fulfilment of prophecy, making the prophesised events his responsibility. The flippant answer would therefore be 'yes, if it stops him forcing prophecy upon us.'",

Foreknowledge is not predeterminism (several reiterations, with variations on 'the plain and simple fact is...')\n 2. Judas had a choice and god simply forsaw what it was (note past tense)\n 3. Something about it being Satan's fault instead.\n \n \nWhich I also briefly addressed previously.\n\n \n Well, now, I confess to being unable to see you making that distinction anywhere. As I've said many times recently, god being able to see what we perceive as our future does not invalidate our free will. It is prophecy - his conveyance of his foreknowledge to us - that causes difficulties.\n \n \nHow would anyone know that? But either way, the choice to betray Jesus was Judas' and not God's.\n\n \n Please, EZ, do me the courtesy of not just tossing this aside as if it were irrelevant. You are discussing this with me, not playing to the gallery. This isn't a popularity contest.\n \n The significance of the question I posed is as follows: if god 'foresaw' the betrayal of Jesus in the future of a world containing the prophecy of that event, then we must at least entertain the possibility that the introduction of prophecy - peoples' knowledge of it - contributed to bringing about its fulfilment.\n \n More problematically, that scenario strips god himself of free will: only god can inspire prophecy, and here he is looking into the future and seeing what happens in a world that contains it. He has no choice but to then introduce that prophecy, or he risks invalidating his own foreknowledge. Does your god run on rails?\n \n Or did he introduce the prophecy and then look ahead? I can't imagine you'd like that option.\n \n The remaining alternative is that god foresees the future of a world that does not contain prophecy of the betrayal of Jesus. But by then introducing that prophecy a thousand years earlier, he must affect later events, either predictably (if we have no free will) or unpredictably (if we have free will). Either way, he must fiddle and faff with the manner in which he introduces the prophecy to ensure our 'choices' fulfil it.\n \n Have you seen that TV series, The Dead Zone? Not as good as the film, but not bad either. The hero of the programme can see peoples' futures when he touches them - what their future will be if he doesn't act, that is. Imagine he sees a future when one man kills another and goes to prison for it. That's foreknowledge. Then he tells someone else about it: that's prophecy. But the hero gets another vision: because he told someone what was going to happen, things are actually going to pan out slightly differently, and the murder is not going to occur.\n \n That's normally where the program would end: disaster averted. But here, with Judas, our 'hero' wants his prophecy fulfilled, so that people will know he's the real deal. So he fiddles around a bit more until his vision correlates with his prophecy again. The preconditions are met, the murder takes place, and the man goes to jail.\n \n As far as everyone else in the story knows, the man committed murder of his own free will. It certainly looks that way. But what they'll never know is how many potential futures our hero had to exclude in order to ensure the fulfilment of his prophecy. Perhaps the murder was very likely to occur no matter what - or perhaps it was a terrible, freak event.\n \n Expand the timescales to millenia, and one cannot but conclude that the likelihood of prophecy being accurately fulfilled is tiny, and the possible alternative futures excluded represent the majority by far. In every way that matters, in this scenario god is responsible for denying Judas the option of avoiding his fate.\n \n I like this analogy just as much: imagine for the sake of argument we have a machine to predict the weather perfectly accurately. We predict a tornado 1000 years in the future, and decide to warn the people in its path by erecting a small sign explaining what's going to happen.\n \n Of course, even such a tiny change as erecting our sign will, as I'm sure you know, completely invalidate our predictions. Our change to the environment changes the weather - just a tiny bit, but that divergence widens rapidly, until after a few days or weeks, never mind decades or centuries, it is unrecognisable.\n \n But we're desperate to sell our weather-predictors, and nobody's going to buy if what we predict doesn't come true. So we fiddle and meddle and adjust the sign, its location, and a few neighbouring stones and suchlike until our calculations indicate that the tornado really will turn up after all.\n \n Now do you appreciate the difference between foreknowledge and prophecy, and the implications of that difference? I truly hope so, because - forgive me - I'm disinclined to explain it again.",

   "I believe the initial conversation had to do with Judas, and how you claimed his betrayal of Christ was preordained by God. I showed you the fallacy in your thinking on that. And even though there was a later prophecy concerning Jesus being betrayed (as Christian prophecy alludes to), that still doesn't mean that God is the one who caused it. After all, at the Last Supper it was Satan who was identified as the one who entered into Judas. Seems to me Satan is a bigger instigator than God in this situation. Again, God simply foreknew the betrayal would occur, and he never specifically identified Judas by name as the one who would be the betrayer.\n \n Now, if you want to talk about other situations apart from Judas, then yes, God is sometimes very instrumental about bringing certain events to pass, like the rebirth of Israel, the Exodus, and other things.\n \n You just need to define what you're specifically talking about.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Why then doesn't Satan get punished for entering a person's body? Would there be evil without Satan? If so, why doesn't God destroy Satan? Is he capable of doing so? If so what is reason for not destroying Satan?",

   "Forgive me for interrupting but Peeling and I have been coming to a similar locale in our discussion. The real issue is that \"foreknowlege\" is a \"human\" perspective and not a god perspective. God did not have before or after knowledge. He simple knows. It is difficult to talk in an appropriate tense for a being that always was, is and will be. We do not have a tense that encompases the past-future-pluperfect tense. That is essentially what we would need to discuss this.\n \n God's knowlege that Jesus would be betrayed did not lay the burden on Judas to do the deed. Additionally, God did in a sense cause the crucifixion, because it is a plan that was laid before time began. It was plan A not plan B. God did what he did because He is Love. The only way to show love is through relationship. God showed that He loved Man so much that He would choose to die for Man so that man could choose God or not. \n \n Now that is free will.\n \n EF\n\n \n \n \n \n \n Actually that is Christianity.

   "Peeling: The significance of the question I posed is as follows: if god 'foresaw' the betrayal of Jesus in the future of a world containing the prophecy of that event, then we must at least entertain the possibility that the introduction of prophecy - peoples' knowledge of it - contributed to bringing about its fulfilment.\n \n It still doesn't matter as God would also have forseen that. If the prophecy were fulfilled in the manner you suggest, then that is also what God foresaw.\n \n Peeling: More problematically, that scenario strips god himself of free will: only god can inspire prophecy, and here he is looking into the future and seeing what happens in a world that contains it. He has no choice but to then introduce that prophecy, or he risks invalidating his own foreknowledge. \n \n That's not problematic and it doesn't strip God of anything. It's just all foretold in advance regardless.\n \n Peeling: The remaining alternative is that god foresees the future of a world that does not contain prophecy of the betrayal of Jesus. But by then introducing that prophecy a thousand years earlier, he must affect later events, either predictably (if we have no free will) or unpredictably (if we have free will). Either way, he must fiddle and faff with the manner in which he introduces the prophecy to ensure our 'choices' fulfil it.\n \n Do you have evidence any of this affected Judas' decision to betray Christ or not betray him? \n \n Peeling: Have you seen that TV series, The Dead Zone? Not as good as the film, but not bad either. The hero of the programme can see peoples' futures when he touches them - what their future will be if he doesn't act, that is. Imagine he sees a future when one man kills another and goes to prison for it. That's foreknowledge. Then he tells someone else about it: that's prophecy. But the hero gets another vision: because he told someone what was going to happen, things are actually going to pan out slightly differently, and the murder is not going to occur.\n \n In God's foreknowledge and economy, the future event will occur regardless of what man might try to do otherwise. For instance, take Joseph. He had the vision / dream from God about his brothers bowing down to him later in life. They tried to make things different - gave him into slavery. So did Potiphar's wife, etc., try to screw him over and he went to jail. But it all happened just as was foretold. \n \n Peeling: But here, with Judas, our 'hero' wants his prophecy fulfilled, so that people will know he's the real deal. So he fiddles around a bit more until his vision correlates with his prophecy again. The preconditions are met, the murder takes place, and the man goes to jail.\n \n Whatever occurs, God forknew. But Christ is betrayed in the end, just as was foreknown and written.\n \n Peeling: I like this analogy just as much: imagine for the sake of argument we have a machine to predict the weather perfectly accurately. We predict a tornado 1000 years in the future, and decide to warn the people in its path by erecting a small sign explaining what's going to happen.\n \n Of course, even such a tiny change as erecting our sign will, as I'm sure you know, completely invalidate our predictions. Our change to the environment changes the weather - just a tiny bit, but that divergence widens rapidly, until after a few days or weeks, never mind decades or centuries, it is unrecognisable.\n \n But we're desperate to sell our weather-predictors, and nobody's going to buy if what we predict doesn't come true. So we fiddle and meddle and adjust the sign, its location, and a few neighbouring stones and suchlike until our calculations indicate that the tornado really will turn up after all.\n \n If God says a tornado will occur in a particular place the future you can do whatever you want, but it's coming and there's nothing you can do to change it.",
