   "In Samuel Huntington's Book, \"The Clash of Civilisations and the Remaking of World Order\", Huntington wrote, \"it is my hypothesis that the fundamental source of conflict in this New World will not be primarily ideological or primarily economic. The Great division among human kind will be cultural. Culture and cultural identities are shaping patterns of cohesion, disintegration, and conflict in this post-cold war world.\" \n \n Do any of you agree with this man's hypothesis? Would you put your ideology in the back seat for the sake of your culture? Does the war on terror support his assertion? Has the Islamic world started a paradyme shift in how enemies are defined? Is the Islamic culture ideological in nature? If so, does this present a problem for his hypothesis? What do you think? Do current events represent the results that support this man's hypothesis? Is Huntington's case so strong that he should begin formulating a conclusion?",
