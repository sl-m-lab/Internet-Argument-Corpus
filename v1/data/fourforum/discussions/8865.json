   "According to Germany Minister of the Interior training of Islamic imams on German soil and studying Islam at schools will cut down risk of radical and extremists Islam spreading in country. Perhaps this makes sense. But mind that 3,4 mln of Muslims are living in Germany now and their number is constantly on the rise. I'm afraid that sooner or later Muslims will be in a majority here and Germans will have to adapt to new situation (I think that newcomers won't learn our religion and traditions and in their patience towards title nation I wouldn't expect as well). Look at what Chechens refugees are doing in Europe. Though small in number they've already managed to become notoriously known in Europe. Those bloody accidents in Belgium, Poland, Austria and Norway were real eye-opening shocks for peaceful Europeans. If being a minority they are contriving to shake and terrorize Europe what will be happening in future when there are lots of them here? \n I think that to guarantee our safety we need to toughen the procedure of getting citizenship here and generally confine immigration. Well, we should welcome the educated and crimeless pretenders and shut the door before those with criminal background and their kind. And after it we will have some advantage and confidence in staying secure in our lands. It is definitely no good to let Chechen barbarians in Germany 'cause they seem reluctant to change themselves up to our ways and norms.",
