   "Jimmy Carter has described Zell Miller's keynote speech at the Republican Convention as \"rabid and mean-spirited.\"\n \n Why did he not say the same of Zell Miller's speech 12 years ago at the Democratic Convention?\n \n Could he have double standards...one set for support of Republicans and another for support of Democrats?\n \n The same guy delivered both speeches. Both were full of fire and brimstone. Both were directed at Presidential candidates. What gives here, Jimmy? Oh, I see, you put the party before the country just like most liberal Democrats do.\n \n BTW, IMO the Carter Administration was one of the worst we've had in a long time.",

   "What is it exactly that Zell Miller said at the Dem convention 12 years ago? Be specific please.\nI don't have a tape of it but I've seen snips in the Democratic TV ad that show Zell 12 years ago saying vehemently that \"George Bush just doesn't get it!\" and several other catchy phrases of the sort Zell delivers so well. It appears to have been just as \"rabid and mean-spirited\" as the most recent speech, but directed toward GHWBush instead of Kerry.\n \n It just appears to me that Jimmy thinks nothing of someone being \"rabid and mean-spirited\" toward a Republican opponent, but criticizes that same someone for being similarly critical of the Democratic nominee.\n \n It's ironic they're both from Georgia.",

He's loyal to the country  he serves, not to some misguided group of left wing liberals who's only loyalty is to the party and the continuance of their grip of the controls. Right or wrong, they're Democrats to the death.\n \n If you look at a large group of Democrats, you'll notice a lot of young pimply-faced sheep in the crowd, perfect for being herded by their leaders.",

   "Yeah, loyal to the country, of course. How could I be so blind?\n \n So the spitball reference was something about John Kerry's vote on the $87b?\n (btw-2 different votes on two different VERSIONS of the same bill is NOT a flip flop)\n \n http://bernie.house.gov/documents/articles/20030917114159.asp\n \n \nPresident Bush says he will ask Congress for $ 87 billion in emergency spending for military and intelligence operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. That's on top of the $ 79 billion Congress already has approved to pay for the war and its immediate aftermath. Neither of these figures includes an estimated $ 50 billion more that will be needed to rebuild Iraq, or any additional expenditures we may need for homeland security.\n\n \n Ok, so Bush gets authorization to use force from Congress along with appropriations to do so ($50+billion). He and his cronies (actually he is their cronie) go into a full scale invasion without enough troops to keep the peace and with troops that don't have enough armor to go around. Then, in the MIDDLE of it all, Bush asks for more and more money that has to come directly from taxes, not Iraqi oil (the first version) to pay for the stuff they needed for a full scale invasion. Anyone voting NO was likely looking to an alternate bill to pay the \"emergency\" funds. Because of the Bushies rush into all of this the govt is spending to record deficits.\n \n None of this sounds good for the country.\n \n Zel Miller criticized Kerry for his No vote for the bill that was proposed to send \"emergency\" funds to the troops who should have had the funds to begin with if we were going for the full scale invasion. \"What are gonna fight with? Spitballs?\" Why the hell were they sent with spitballs in the first place?\n \n So anyway, if you wanna say that he is loyal to the country for supporting the Bushies, go for it.",
