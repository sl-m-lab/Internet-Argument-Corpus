But some analysts supposed that Christmas vacations will be some point of stabilization but CIA agents in Greece work well and disorders gain momentum.\n I think that now EU needs to think that celebration of new 2009 could turn into the huge confusion because of drunken students in Spain, France, Italy and other could add to their coevals from Greece. Americans will try to realize this plan with all their might! It's clear that while Europe will be suffocating in mass protest action amid world's financial crisis wily Americans will be trying to reconstruct their economy!",

In case you didn't know, the rest of world is dependent on the US. If we go down the rest of the world goes down. It's not our fault your countries choose to accept this. It's their fault.",
