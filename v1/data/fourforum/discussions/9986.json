   "Simone:\n \n It is good of you to post Swedenborg's theology. I'm sure it gives you strength and clear seeing in your Bible readings. Truth is not truth without kindness of heart or a good heart. :) \n \n Swedenborg talks of the Universal principles of all religion consisting of (1) belief in God and (2) living a good life.\n \n \"Every man [or woman] can be saved, and those are saved who acknowledge God and live rightly\" (Divine Providence n. 325). \n \n \n Here is another quote about how people universally think of God:\n \n \"This only One and very Self is omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent. This also every Christian acknowledges from his doctrine and every gentile from his religion. In consequence, wherever he is, a man thinks that God is there and that he prays to God at hand; thinking and praying so, men cannot but think that God is everywhere, that is, omnipresent [in all places at all times]; likewise omniscient [all knowing] and omnipotent [all powerful]. Everyone praying to God, therefore, implores Him from the heart to lead him because He can lead him; thus he acknowledges the divine omnipresence, omniscience and omnipotence, doing so in turning his face to the Lord; thereupon the truth flows in from the Lord\" (Divine Providence n. 157). \n \n \n Swedenborg condensed his entire doctrine as this:\n \n \"That God is one, and that there is a conjunction of charity and faith\" (Soul and Body n. 20). \n \n The condensed doctrine is that God is one, and God is a marriage of Divine Love and Divine Wisdom (which explains the union of charity and faith in saved people) and it explains the trinity too - two things that produce a resultant action. Charity, Faith and Good Works in not an outdated idea. That is what a saved person has. It is much like the Lord having the Father, Son and what comes forth from the Lord - the Holy Spirit. :)",
