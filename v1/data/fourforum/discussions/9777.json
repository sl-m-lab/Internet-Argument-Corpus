   "The stated YEC position is that God created the Earth 10,000 to 6,000 years ago. They also hold that God does not try to trick people. In this lies a fundamental problem and why it is heretical to the Christian belief. \n \n Christianity teaches that Christ practiced honesty and humility. Christ did not practice or preach or even condone under and circumstance deceit. Therefore if God created the Earth as we see it, we should be able to understand how he did it and furthermore track the changes that he enacted or at least watched over. God would not try to trick us by producing a Earth that did not match Genesis nor what we could see and study. Trickery in Christianity is realm of Satan and Satan did not create the Earth. \n \n As science explains according to various examples ranging from plate tectonics, to isotopic dating that the Earth is indeed more then a mere 10,000 years old, Young Earth Creationism is heretical to the faith as they would argue that what we can see is not what God created. This explicitly argues that God did in fact create something different but deliberately hid the effects of his work. This would then argue that the Christian God employs deception and dishonesty, something very heretical to the religion. Therefore, if Young Earth Creationists truly believe they are Christians, they would abandon a heretical belief.",

Either that, or you are incredibly inconsistent in your reasoning.\n\n \n Actually, the heresy issue is in response to Arch earlier stating that God created a universe that appears older than it is. This form of creationist interpretation of reality (supported by many Christian apologetics) IS heretical. It's not a well thought out answer but suffices for those who are biblically ignorant (most Christians). And, anyone who supports this has to answer the contradiction in biblical fundamentals is proposes. \n \n Either God is a liar or he's not.\n The bible says He's not a liar(deciever).\n If he's not a liar, then WHY does the universe and earth appear older than a few thousand years?\n \n If, as some Christians follow, the earth is as old as we observe it, then was there a 6 day creation? Was there a real Adam and Eve?\n \n If the answers are also no (or they are allegorical) then you don't have an actual event of man's fall from grace by sin...\n No genesis fall story as factual and there is no need later for a 'Messiah' to save humanity from damnation caused by that fall.\n Thus, the Christ is either delusional or another fabrication. \n \n Without a 6 day creation, traditional Christianity falls flat on it's face.\n THIS is why some Christians (smarter ones) fight so hard to maintain a young earth belief system. \n Thus, when in creation vs evolution debates, you hear calls by Christians that evolutionists are being anti-Christian in their beliefs simply because IF evolution is factual, it destroys the fall story and makes atonement for sin pointless in the traditional (and literal) reading of the bible.\n \n Allegorical Christian (liberals, non-fundameltalist) are more often than not, Cafeteria types who merely pick and choose what THEY like. Much like your own Zen Diest Christian Jeffersonian approach. Basically, pick what you like and what you feel comfortable with. \n Personally, it doesn't bother me. Other than I find it commical. \n But, you are damned to the Christian hell because of it. (IF hell/lake of fire even exists).\n \n Scripture locks itself into a cycle of reasoning that causes it to implode upon itself. \n Christianity is a small lie told long ago that has ballooned to enormous porportions and now getting to the point where observers can see it for the falsehood it is. \n Like when a child tells a small white lie to explain something simple and then dogmatically sticks to the lie, adding more on top of it when needed to protect the lie. Until eventually it all blows up in their face. \n \n \n As to the Jesus not correcting comment you mention.\n He didn't really correct a lot when you look at it. \n \n My guess would be he was a delusional man who was following a preestablished script...or a coconspirator in deception as he veiled his true power and knowledge...or, possiblly a made up story also.",

   "Jesus wasn't about that. He was about preaching humility, honesty, love, lots of stuff modern Christians reject.\n\n \n Yes, those seemed to be the main talking points. But, he also addressed Working on the Sabbath, Divorce, Forgiveness and legal dealings and several other subjects that stemmed from traditional Mosaic laws, Jewish beliefs, doctrinal and dogmatic issues. \n \n The main problems is what scripture further adds to taht 'love' message. Notably his death on the cross for the sacrifice for mans sins. If he was merely teaching another generic love message (like many eastern religiouns push) his death sacrifice would be not needed. Rather than believe his message (on love) we have to believe in Him for salvation as our works alone (love for one another) aren't sufficient to get us to heaven.\n \n So, those who seem to think Jesus was just about the love message are totally over looking most of the bible as well as most of what He actually said about who he is and what he came for.\n I have no problems with these people in general. They're often pretty easy to get along with but, other than a vague generic sugar coating immitation, I wouldn't consider them real Christians.\n \n Seems the new song is,\n \n Jesus loves me this I know\n I'm sure my bible tells me so\n Red or green, black or white\n He even loves a sodomite.\n \n Fornication is quite nice\n Something we don't sacrifice\n We sing and dance in my church\n Where the lovely Idols do now perch.\n \n And I'm a gluttonous little freak\n 'Cause Jesus don't like the weak\n So come now join me yes you can\n In our humble frying pan.\n \n I've read half that is in red \n From the bible near my bed\n With Jane and Jan, Dan and Mel\n But I doubt that I will go to hell.\n \n For Jesus loves me this I know\n I'm sure my bible tells me so\n If I'm wrong then I will wanna\n Take a side trip to Nirvana.\n \n I heard that it is quite nice\n Some say it's like paradice\n But what the heck do I know\n I'm tripping on shrooms and some blow.\n \n ;)",

You aren't the 1st to push that, I've read it in several Christian apologetic books before. \n It often can work on many ignorant Christians (which I've stated are most of them) who hardly know what their own bible says. But, it doesn't fly with one who's read, studied and spent years in theological and doctrinal research on the subject. Most don't even know that \"God can not lie.\" is in the bible as a description of what God is. \n Pretty sad state for Christians who either want to criple His sovereignty and make Him subservient to man or those who want to attribute abilities to Him since He's 'all powerful and can do anything' including the ability to deceive and lie.\n \n \n So, while I can understand how you got onto the wrong foot in attacking my statements (the thread is convoluted and covers several points and hits some tangents too), to admit you misread my post and took comments out of context would lend credibility that you may also do so with Scripture.\n This would explain how you would seek to blindly parrot apologetic statements in explaining the appearance of an old earth while trying to defend young earth beliefs...all the while failing to heed correct doctrine and proper division of the Word particularly in concerning the nature of God and his works.\n \n If you wish to abandon the misconception that 'God made it that way' on explaining why earth/existance looks old when it is actually young, I'd LOVE to hear an explanation. Particularly one based on sound doctrine and use of scripture.\n \n I personally don't care if the earth is a day old or a hundren bazillion years old. I do lend credibility to the explanations evolutionist give as certain aspects are reproducable and observable. \n I particularly liked a recent public TV documentary I saw on great flooding caused by massive glacial lakes breaking Ice dams* and hurtling more water than in a great lake onto a plain and causing flooding, erosion and other interesting effects. An event the researchers said happened several times from observerable evidence and was reproducable on a small scale. Thus, aspects of the great flood of noah can coincide with other beliefs.\n \n \n * Like in the movie Ice Age 2: The great melt.\n \n \n As to this,\n \n\n Now I'm going to try to get you to understand one more time why believers can believe in the YEC and it doesn't make God the liar whether they are right or wrong. Because God isn't responsible for man misinterpreting His Word if they are. The bible doesn't age the Earth or man precisely so Theologians have attempted to date humanity and the age of Creation for a thousand years now. But let's say they are wrong, and I'm not saying they are; but how does that make God a liar and a deceiver ? Your logic is as ignorant as your knowledge of the bible and theology itself.\n\n \n It makes God a liar when creation is oviously billions of years old. \n This is observable by knowing the speed of light (and how it speeds up or slows down) and seeing other galaxies millions of light years away and knowing it takes millions of light years for the images we're seeing to get to us.\n So, we have the stars in the sky that have existed for at least several billion years. They start to exist EITHER during the creation during Genesis 1 or sometime later. Genesis 1 also chronicles the creation of the earth, all creatures in it and man as well. Thus, the initial creation of a biblical man would be at least several billion years ago (since he either existed days after their creation or pre-existed them).\n \n Thus, biblical man is vastly ancient, not 'young'. \n Not even taking into consideration evience of the earth itself, just using the light of the heavenly bodies.\n \n IF, God made existance/man in your time frame (6,000-25,000 years or so), we would NOT be able to NATURLLY see most of the stars in the sky as the light wouldn't have yet arrived to meet our eyes.\n The explanation you give for this is that God made everything in motion. He didn't start from the beginning and let things happen naturally but made it so that some aspects were created 'in motion'. Thus we can see the light of far away stars because God wanted it that way (some say to test our faith).\n If you say God sped up light so we could see the stars, then he's meddling with his creation after the 6th day...didn't he \"see that all he had made was good\" and stop after that initial bout of creating? Why meddle with it after wards? Why seek to trick man by either speeding up light or creating it in motion? There is no reason that the senses of man should decieve us. There is no reason for a deceptive creation (something made by God) to lead man to believe he's millions/billions of years old according to the biblical story when you're pushing one vastly younger.\n \n By use of simple human senses and knowledge coinciding with the creation story as LITERAL, humanity is ancient.\n If all of humanities senses are wrong, how can we accuratly percieve anything of this world, including a book writen by other humans?\n \n You can find another reason why I can see far away stars without saying 'Goddidit'. Because the excuse that god wants it that way makes God a deceptive entity. Something the bible says He isn't. Because it is deceptive to have a creation appear to be billions of years old and a humanity as old when it isn't. It is not my beliefs that made God into a liar, it's the fallacious logic you tried to push with the apologestic reasoning in the Religion thread that would, following logic, make god out to be a liar.\n \n An remember this is about YEC, not about 6 day creationism beliefs.\n I'm also curious where people even get the notion that the earth/humanity is only a few thousand years old.

That's why even though you can read and listen, according to the word, you can neither see or hear the truth within it.\n\n \n Sooo, rather than address the question on 'Why does the earth/existance appear older than your non-biblical belief on YEC would have one believe?' you prefer to attack the questioner stating that he doesn't possess special knowledge that you do. Or that the question is flawed as the questioner doesn't.\n \n I'm curious, is the ONLY scripture you have for a YEC belief that on the geneology from Adam to Jesus (determining age of some by biblical statements and extrapolating the ages of the rest) and tacking on 2,000 years to that to get the age of the earth? \n \n So, you're using 'logic' and extrapolation on biblical statements to come to a conclusion on a rough time estimate on the age of the world, no?\n \n No different than me using the same reasoning to come to the conclusion that your beliefs on YEC would make God out to be deceptive as His creation would be deceptive which, logically can't be true as explained based on biblical statements.\n Your only defense to this is that you're right and I'm wrong because you have special revelations and powers and my senses or interpretation is off.\n \n It's very simple. Existance appears older than you say it is. \n This is a form of decpetion. \n You say it's us who are decieving ourselves with a bad interpretation...but, earlier, you said it was 'Because God made it that way.' \n Us decieving ourselves is more biblically correct that saying 'godditit' but doesn't get you much support because you can't substantiate that claim based on anything other than your own beliefs.\n Your comments that 'God [made existance appear older than it is] is heresy as it paints God as a deciever and liar, something you Scripture says He isn't.\n \n \n \n \n @ BeHereNow,\n Thanks for the description of your beliefs.\n I have no real way of knowing how long you've practiced your beliefs and was basing my comments on the way some of your other postings have appeared. From past personal experience, many who have spoken similar are more often than not, young converts as older people who are mature in their beliefs have a slightly different communication style. But, you're new to the forum and it could be simple communications errors.\n I would personally not push the 'Jeffersonian Christian' description much as it's deceptive and misleading to most and he was very cafateria in his own approach to the issue. According to scriptue, Jesus DID state he was the son of God and it is repeatedly stated He was ressurrected. The virgin birth isn't repeated often (I don't recall Paul mentioning it at all). And the bible is the primary source of Christian beliefs. So, being selective on what you follow and what you don't is...being selective. \n Jefferson's own public comments could have been deceptive as he wanted to appear as 'one of them' whilst using verbal literalism as he saw it to actually say something else. I and many others do this quite often. It's political, legalist and effective most often. \n \n As to mind control. I didn't suggest that either. Although it is interesting to note that many Zen practices can lead to that. Meditation and chanting are often quite capable of altering brain chemistry and leading one to a heightened state of suggestibility.",

Salvation happens within our soul and comes from God, not man or church or religion. \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you\". \n \n \nIs it in code? You can \"hear\" the truth in something you read but others can't? I guess that means that you read out loud. I think I saw you on the corner of Canal St. and Decatur St. in New Orleans, waving your Bible over your head while shouting the truth within it.\n\n \n Every believer who has received Jesus in Truth, and possesses the indwelling of the Holy Spirit of God fulfills the definition of being Born Again according to Gods promises in the bible. Every one who doesn't, isn't. No matter how much they insist they know the truth, they don't know HIS TRUTH which is the only truth that matters in the end.\n \n Apart from Christ no one can know the truth in the bible. And unless Jesus opens our eyes by way of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit which He sends to indwell all believers, then any interpretations made by the Natural Man are, well, just that, Natural interpretations based on the understanding of the flesh. And the flesh cannot comprehend the Spirit. \n \n So the fact remains that we are from different Worlds, and I've lived in your World so I know it represents death and hopelessness while you have never walked in my World which is one of Hope and Eternal Life. Judge me if you like, mock me and my God if you choose, but I'm telling you straight out, unless you submit yourself to the Lord and seek His face, you'll remain in bondage to sin and the hopelessness of secular humanism which is in itself a religion. Just the religion of man rather than God.\n \n So don't believe or follow me as I'm a sinner just like you are. And in more need of forgiveness than you are. I don't hold myself up as an example of righteousness but as an example of our need for salvation and the grace that only a loving God has to offer to us. But seek Him and submit yourself to Him and If you sincerely do that, He will come to you as it say's... Behold, I stand at the door and knock, if you open the door (of your heart) I will come into you, and dine with you, and you with me. That is a promise from the Lord Himself and it is a reliable promise that you can bet your soul on.",

You prove your total and complete ignorance regarding the spiritual truths that Jesus came to reveal to us. All this while insisting that it is you who are enlightened and knowledgeable about Christianity and its precepts. You write very well zardoz, what a shame you say nothing at all of value. Your words are as shallow as your truth, which sadly isn't truth at all but the continued lies of this World.\n \n Also, please post where I mentioned buying salvation with money ? It's kind of hard to do that when I failed to send you to a particular church at all. But slander and defamation is your game, not truth or the search for it.",

That's a sign of sure ignorance you know when one can't understand what another said. I'll try again; I said that any expert on aerodynamics would tell you that based on it mass, shape and wingspan, bumble bee's SHOULD NOT \"BE ABLE TO\" FLY. Never did I say they CAN'T fly.\n\n So, you continue to spew your ignorance despite the fact that it has been shown to you several times now that we DO know how they fly, and that your claims are lies. I never expected any less from you.\n \n \n\n Again you show your ignorance by inaccurately repeating what you allege I wrote. Feel free to post anything I wrote using the Ica stones as proof that dinos lived with humans ? I posted an extensive article that gave multiple examples of dino sightings by people, and within it was the Ica stone story which I didn't even notice when I posted the piece. But leave it to you hypocrites to jump on that one story and label me stupid because of it. You're so pathetic it boggles the mind.\n\n \n So, you admit that you just cut and paste #### from sites without even bothering to even give it more than a cursory glance to see if it fits with your belief.",

   "No, but leave it to you to misinterpret what I said once again. That's a sign of sure ignorance you know when one can't understand what another said.\n\n \n You might want to check your web of lies before saying anything.\n \n \nI'll try again; I said that any expert on aerodynamics would tell you that based on it mass, shape and wingspan, bumble bee's SHOULD NOT \"BE ABLE TO\" FLY. Never did I say they CAN'T fly.\n\n \n \nWell riddle me this schmuck, how does a bumble bee fly ? The greatest minds in the field can't figure that one out. So obviously bumble bees flying must not truly exist right ? Scientifically it's proven to be impossible\n\n \n You argued that science says bumble bees can't fly according to the greatest minds. You also stated it was scientifically proven to be impossible, which Pandion cited verbatim. Therefore you are not only lying here, but you owe him a apology, unless you want to be insane and claim that you never made such a comment (like the Incan Rocks one). \n \n That's still ignoring the point that you were peddling a hoax in the first place.\n Please show me biblical passages promoting deceit and dishonesty, if you don't, that means you are deliberately not following Christanity. \n \n \nAgain you show your ignorance by inaccurately repeating what you allege I wrote. Feel free to post anything I wrote using the Ica stones as proof that dinos lived with humans? I posted an extensive article that gave multiple examples of dino sightings by people, and within it was the Ica stone story which I didn't even notice when I posted the piece. But leave it to you hypocrites to jump on that one story and label me stupid because of it. You're so pathetic it boggles the mind.\n\n \n Talk about hypocrisy. You based people on politics when they post a site you don't like. You hold them accountable for what they post. Anything that one posts outside of a quote from the person they are addressing is fair game to criticize them on. You're now trying to weasel your way out from defending a article you never read in the first place. If anyone of us did that you'd be slamming us on it. You are not a Christian, you're a Hypocracists. At least you admit you don't read what you post. And you are stupid if you don't read a article before posting it. \n \n \nIt's gibberish and psycho babble.\n\n \n Well that makes alot of sense. Reason, logic and evidence are all just \"gibberish and psycho babble.\" No wonder you're getting destroyed here. \n \n \nHe attempts to sound intelligent and spiritually minded while maintaining that he is too intelligent to actually buy into the myths of the bible. He hasn't a clue as to the richness and depth of the TRUTH given to us in the Word of God just you you don't.\n\n \n Now that's gibberish. Pandion is allegedly wrong and has character flaws because he won't view the bible the same way I do. seriously, that's just childish. And it's a fallacy. \n \n \nHe promises, and fulfilled in my life the passage that say's \"If you'll reach out into the darkness, I will find you.\" So I didn't find Him, He found me. This World is that place of darkness, deception and lies. So the only real evidence you can acquire must be personally attained by reaching out to the living God with a sincere heart and actually submitting your will to Him. The fear and sense of eternal commitment is palpable, but once we realize that He is a real and personal God who loves us, the rewards for submitting to His Love are so much greater than rejecting Him.\n \n But without an open heart and a hunger for a Truth that's greater than your own, you cannot ever realize what I'm describing. This is a supernatural experience which surpasses all understanding that the Natural Man can even relate to or comprehend.\n\n \n And this differs from mentally ill patients how? The voices the voices!\n \n \nSo don't believe or follow me as I'm a sinner just like you are. And in more need of forgiveness than you are.\n\n \n Considering how little of Christanity you practice, you're in need of massive amount of forgiveness. You don't see Pandion spreading lies in the name of his beliefs, nor do you see him refusing to admit he was wrong, two major things you do that you will never find support for in the bible. Last time I checked, Jesus was pro-knowledge pro-humility. You are follow a anti-theistical view of that. \n \n \nThat is a promise from the Lord Himself and it is a reliable promise that you can bet your soul on.\n\n \n I suppose if God can accept someone as morally bankrupt as you (it doesn't get any lower, every time I see your post, it's rock bottom), it may be worth looking into.",

In order to accept some of the more amoral beliefs some christians claim, one must disregard directly what the bible say's. And I wont do that.\n \n Other parts, such as Genesis which prompts the evolution vs ID debate are more subjective and difficult to interpret so there's much to debate and disagree upon. Let me try to explain what I mean by this. At the time of Adams creation according to Genesis, at just 1 day old he had knowledge and the wisdom to name all the animals. Adam was created with maturity and fully grown as a man. This proves that God was capable of, and even prone to creating new life with the appearance of age.\n \n How do we know He didn't do the same thing with the creation of the Earth and the Universe, and all of time and space for that matter. Imagine if He held a hard ball of compressed matter in the palm of His hands, as he pulled his hands apart he pulled and stretched time and space apart creating what we perceive as a measurable eternity ? Within this eternity are the uncountable Universes, within which are the uncountable Galaxies, within which are the uncountable Solar Systems, within which is our Solar System, within which is our Planet which He created right here to support us ?\n \n Now to God who did the creating, it took the first day. To us who is observing our place in an expanding Universe it appears to have been here for 14 billion years. From our perspective this seems obvious and reasonable, but in reality it would be wrong. Assuming my spiritual perception is correct of course. And all I'm doing is suggesting another possibility. I'm not attempting to force anyone to believe as I do. \n \n \nJesus can't threaten me. No such person existed. The one who did went by a different name. How'd you feel if someone kept invoking you by using an incorrect name? Your sect is too lazy to even bother worshiping the one true God(tm) by calling him his proper name. So, as He has never done anything for me or against me...I'm not threatened by him.\n\n \n Yeshua is the Hebrew name for Jesus which is the english word for who He is. Do you really think He, the Messiah is angry at people for referring to Him in their native languages through out history, what ever language that is ? You're really stretching Zardoz in you feeble attempts to condemn and criticize me.\n \n \nI am however threatened by several of the sects that state they follow him. As are many here on this forum. They are deceptive and destructive.\n For example, EasyRiders own branch of pentacostalism is extremely destructive to families. They use EVERY cultic practice in the book to isolate members and make them subservient to the church heirchy. The sad fact is, the bible can be used to support their efforts.\n \n \n I'm not familiar with ERs denomination so I can neither defend or criticize what they teach or believe. If based on how many of you have distorted what I believe and know the bible promotes, I tend to believe that you are most likely corrupting what ER actually believes and taking an extremist perspective that is more paranoid that reality based. If you can direct me to ERs actual posts that concern you, I would be happy to objectively assess them based on the scriptures. \n \n \nI also like it how you don't answer or address my question no contradict my commentary on what you said is cultic.\n\n \n Simply put, a cult is any belief system that leads men away from God and forces them to follow an individual person or a particular church. When the rules and bylaws of the church differ from and detract from the Word of God, then that is a cult. I refer to Mormons and JWs as christian cults because their followers are taught and forced that they must earn their way into heaven by works and not by Grace. \n \n \nYou want people to believe they are in need of salvation for what ever reason, consider them damaged and near worthless and facing eternal pain and sufferign UNLESS they accept you version of salvation and protection.\n\n \n This is your distorted interpretation of what I believe again Zardoz and I have repeatedly stated that we are all made in the image of a Righteous and Holy God, that we are all children of the King and heirs of the Everlasting Maker of All that is. How is this saying that unbelievers are worthless human beings ?\n \n And haven't I said that I humble myself before a righteous and perfect God who has done his work to bring all of humanity back to Himself by reversing the fallen nature we inherited through Adam and Eve ? I didn't write this reality Zardoz, I'm just reporting what must be done to be saved.\n \n \nYou aren't a cult leader...you're a brainwashed follower.\n Mostly begnin but when you activities start to influence me in any way, you can become a hazard and malignant force.\n I certainly wouldn't want your beliefs on YEC taught in a secular public school.\n\n \n How are my opinions on a public debate forum considers activities ? And how do they influence you in any way ? Why must you take such an extremist and paranoid view of what I believe ? Have I agreed with islamic Jihadists that anyone who disagrees with my brand of religion should be beheaded ? Have I called for arrests or murders of people who reject my Savior ? Or haven't I said that rather than tolerate and accept sinful lifestyle that conflict with Gods Word, we would correct them, pray for them, and ask God to reveal His truth to them. \n \n \nNor would I want EZ's style of belief pushed into my gov't. As I said in the religion thread, he seeks to usher in the 2nd coming overtly and subvertly.

This was something he never denies. It's also something they actively teach their followers in church, preach on the airwaves and print in numerous books (including best seller series).\n\n \n Again, I have no reason to believe Easy Rider believes as you say he does. But if you're accurate in what you say, I strongly disagree with attempting to manipulate World history to the detriment of humanity in order to usher in Armageddon, the Tribulation period or Christs return. God is very much aware of His perfect timing for when the End of this Age will come and it would be absolute foolishness for any believers from any church to attempt to rush His timing.

   "I am wondering how long it is that you have been a Buddhist, that you are so knowledgeable.\n Tell me, is Buddhism atheistic, or theistic?\n\n \n Neither in the traditional sense. Buddhism is not a orthodox religion.\n \n \nOr I may be wrong, and it is many years that you have been a deist, so I wonder how many years have you been a deist.\n Tell me, I would like to know more about these clear traits that deism has concerning god. Please list them for me.\n\n \n years is irrelevant. Arch has claimed to be a Christian for his decades long life and he obviously doesn't know much about or follow any of it. Your argument is a modification of the fallacy of knowledge of the ancients. Not exactly a good argument no? At the very heart of Deism, a God has setup at least the basic structures of the universe. You need at bare absolute minimum that belief in God and its traits to be a Deist. As you appear to have no traits of God, you cannot be a Deist. You fail the very first test. Furthermore, Deism is anti-Textual study yet Zen Buddhism is still engaged in the study of several holy texts (not as much as the other Buddhist sects, but that's not the point). You seem to have another conflicting issue here. Furthermore Zen Buddhism is part of a school of Buddhism thought. Deism is obviously not in favor of that as it is through self observation of the world one comes to a conclusion, not being taught how to think and see. So unless you're picking and choosing what parts of Zen you want (which questions if there's any meaning at that point), you have two conflicting religions on your hands.\n \n \nAre Christians therefore not able to eat ice cream cones?\n\n \n Irrelevant. You lack the first key aspect of a belief in Deism. How can you be a Deist? \n \n Can you call someone a Christian if you do not follow Christ? No.",

   "No Zardoz, I speak english, sorry that causes problems for you.\n\n I don't think you understand the term. Any words given new meaning, any words created to express a new thought that is limited to the subject and subject only is babble. Holy Spirit means NOTHING to a non-Christian. Neigher does 'bathed in the blood' 'revival' 'rapture' 'anointed' 'sanctified'... I could go on. These are exclesive terminology designed or mutated to seperate one group from another. I could use the same for other groupings.\n When you say those words, in English, to another English speaker who isn't part of your grouping, you get confussion. \n Any one who has an inkling of linguistics knowledge, sociologly and psychology can spot this a mile away.\n \n \nRespecting ones right to believe as they do doesn't mean one must respect the beliefs themselves. In order to accept some of the more amoral beliefs some christians claim, one must disregard directly what the bible say's. And I wont do that.\n\n But, do you really respect their rights???\n Most here would probably say you don't.\n \n \nOther parts, such as Genesis which prompts the evolution vs ID debate are more subjective and difficult to interpret so there's much to debate and disagree upon. Let me try to explain what I mean by this. At the time of Adams creation according to Genesis, at just 1 day old he had knowledge and the wisdom to name all the animals. Adam was created with maturity and fully grown as a man. This proves that God was capable of, and even prone to creating new life with the appearance of age.\n \n How do we know He didn't do the same thing with the creation of the Earth and the Universe, and all of time and space for that matter. Imagine if He held a hard ball of compressed matter in the palm of His hands, as he pulled his hands apart he pulled and stretched time and space apart creating what we perceive as a measurable eternity ? Within this eternity are the uncountable Universes, within which are the uncountable Galaxies, within which are the uncountable Solar Systems, within which is our Solar System, within which is our Planet which He created right here to support us ?\n \n Now to God who did the creating, it took the first day. To us who is observing our place in an expanding Universe it appears to have been here for 14 billion years. From our perspective this seems obvious and reasonable, but in reality it would be wrong. Assuming my spiritual perception is correct of course. And all I'm doing is suggesting another possibility. I'm not attempting to force anyone to believe as I do. \n\n This is the heart of this thread. An unshacked God who is omnipotant COULD do such things...however, your God isn't this. He has to conform to how scripture describes him. One of his descriptions is that he isn't deceptive or a liar. Those are the descriptions of his enemy, Satan.\n For the Christian God to create the universe 'in motion' as you descrive is a form of deception.\n I understand why Christian creationists defend the literalism of Genesis. if they don't the house of cards falls down. No Adam, no fall. No Fall, no need for a savior.\n \n \nYeshua is the Hebrew name for Jesus which is the english word for who He is. Do you really think He, the Messiah is angry at people for referring to Him in their native languages through out history, what ever language that is ? You're really stretching Zardoz in you feeble attempts to condemn and criticize me.\n\n Nope, not at all. Names have power. This is dogma and often doctrin in nearly all religions, more so with Christian history.\n You're praying to the wrong person. \n Many times I have been called by the wrong name. After a while, I simply don't even respond.\n If you can't take the time to say my name right, how can you be my friend let alone a follower? You want to get to know me? The learn to pronounce my name.\n This is one of the issues Islam has on the Koran in Arabic. Get it right or you'll find yourself eventually mutating not only 'petty' issues into something else, but over looking really important aspects of your own faith.\n I rejoice every day that the heretics who translated the bible were delivered their just deserts.\n In the end, I'd say you're too lazy to love God.\n \n \nI'm not familiar with ERs denomination so I can neither defend or criticize what they teach or believe. If based on how many of you have distorted what I believe and know the bible promotes, I tend to believe that you are most likely corrupting what ER actually believes and taking an extremist perspective that is more paranoid that reality based. If you can direct me to ERs actual posts that concern you, I would be happy to objectively assess them based on the scriptures.\n\n EZ stated his church in the religion forum. One can then look up their stated belief system. One can also visiting their churches (like Catholicism, many sects are standardized). \n \n \nSimply put, a cult is any belief system that leads men away from God and forces them to follow an individual person or a particular church. When the rules and bylaws of the church differ from and detract from the Word of God, then that is a cult. I refer to Mormons and JWs as christian cults because their followers are taught and forced that they must earn their way into heaven by works and not by Grace. \n\n Actually, that's the CHRISTIAN definition of cult.\n Such a definition is only applicable to christianity, a minority, and doesn't apply to the whole.\n As said, many groupings are cults.\n Some, however, are destructive in their approaches.\n \n Anything with a single authoritarian leader should be looked upon with suspicion, especially if s/he hands out arbitrary rulings or wants to dictate in minute detail how their followers live their lives. Many evangelical leaders in the US engage in these practices. \n Critical thinking of followers is stiffled with thought stopping mantras and activities. Questioning the leaders statements and practices is viewed as an actual attack on God.\n \n One of the most ironic things is while lambasting the Catholic church and their heirarchial system of priests and pope as a 'middle man between the follower and God', many evangelical groups, particularly Charismatics and Pentecostals, engage in this on a level surpassing Catholicism.\n \n \nThis is your distorted interpretation of what I believe again Zardoz and I have repeatedly stated that we are all made in the image of a Righteous and Holy God, that we are all children of the King and heirs of the Everlasting Maker of All that is. How is this saying that unbelievers are worthless human beings ?\n\n \n \nAnd haven't I said that I humble myself before a righteous and perfect God who has done his work to bring all of humanity back to Himself by reversing the fallen nature we inherited through Adam and Eve ? I didn't write this reality Zardoz, I'm just reporting what must be done to be saved.\n\n I don't attack you on your activities outside this forum. And for all I know, you do make efforts to humble yourself. But, here you have been noted to be abrassive and have improperly (for a Christian) judged and attacked others. When I believe you've stated something that is scripturally correct, I offer support (in that context) even if I believe it is 100% bogus and have no personal belief in it. I comment only on what I know or believe.\n What you're doing is presenting your interpretation of genesis as factual.\n \n \nHow are my opinions on a public debate forum considers activities ? And how do they influence you in any way ? Why must you take such an extremist and paranoid view of what I believe ? Have I agreed with islamic Jihadists that anyone who disagrees with my brand of religion should be beheaded ? Have I called for arrests or murders of people who reject my Savior ? Or haven't I said that rather than tolerate and accept sinful lifestyle that conflict with Gods Word, we would correct them, pray for them, and ask God to reveal His truth to them. \n\n It's not the limits of a forum. It's the larger picture of the world. If you champion laws to have nonsense taught in public schools, that's what affects me and my children.\n You don't need to be an Islamic Jihadist to be a Christian Crusader...which are the same thing on a basic level. Your tools do differ from the jihadist but are nevertheless destructive.\n \n \nAgain, I have no reason to believe Easy Rider believes as you say he does. But if you're accurate in what you say, I strongly disagree with attempting to manipulate World history to the detriment of humanity in order to usher in Armageddon, the Tribulation period or Christs return. God is very much aware of His perfect timing for when the End of this Age will come and it would be absolute foolishness for any believers from any church to attempt to rush His timing. The thought of such manipulation is blasphemous in my opinion as it attempts to control God.\n\n I would agree, a Christian should leave this all up to a Soverign Lord who has total control of all aspects of existance rather than seek to be an active participant in creating conditions for His return.\n One should seek to be prepared to meet their maker at every moment of their life in an instant rather than put it off for tomorrow or seek signs as an adulturous people would.\n \n As a non-believer, I would have little problems with the humble person who focused on thier life and what actual good they can do for another but those who seek to affect politics, foster conflict and wars casue more harm than good...those are the one's who should be avoided.\n Unfortunatly there are groups who do pervade the evangelical movement in recent years who do believe the latter.\n While this would sound like a conspiracy theory, all one has to do is visit their churches and such to know that it's far from a lie.\n \n As I've said in the past.\n If this magical thing known as a Raputure were to occur,\n I'm shooting survivors.\n emoticon_xangel",

   "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eric-roston/splitting-atoms_b_48438.html\n \n \nThree Republicans raised their hands at a recent presidential debate when asked if they do not recognize evolution. The obvious joke here is that the act of raising their hands will eventually be proof of natural selection as they are whisked from the national stage.\n \n A reasonable follow-up question to the troika would have been, \"Do you believe the Earth is several thousand years old, and if so, do you also acknowledge the implication that nuclear weaponry does not and has never existed?\" The science of the two are more closely linked than you might expect.\n \n The Earth is 4.54 billion years old, give or take 100 million years. Physicists determined this date by studying the uranium and lead composition of dozens of terrestrial rocks and meteorites.\n \n Uranium is a chemical element, one of those 90 (or 118, depending on how you count) fundamental kinds of matter, each of which has its own characteristic atom. A single element can claim atoms of varying mass. Some masses, or isotopes, are stable. Some are not. Certain elements' isotopes are known to decay, or emit radiation, at known rates. For example, carbon-14 is used to date objects made from once-living matter that is no more than 50,000 years old. It has been shown to both prove and disprove the ancient age of the Shroud of Turin. (Long story.)\n \n Uranium atoms come in two sizes, U-238 and U-235. Over time much of it has decayed into lead, Pb-206 and Pb-207. Geologists know how fast uranium decays, and assume that lead and uranium were equally dispersed around the Solar System at its inception. By measuring the modern ratios of lead isotopes in the Earth and meteorites, they can count backward to a time when no uranium had yet decayed into lead: The beginning of the solar system. The answer, from more than 70 rocks, comes to 4.54 billion years ago.\n \n Nuclear weaponry takes advantage of the instability of uranium isotopes. U-235, or highly enriched uranium, made up the core of the bomb used to destroy Hiroshima in August 1945. It lies at the heart of more powerful hydrogen bombs, which incorporate U-238 fuel as well.\n \n Uranium is uranium. Lead isotopes, Pb-206 and Pb-207, indicate the previous existence of uranium. The properties of this element have guided scientists to both estimate the age of the Earth and build nuclear arsenals. That's why the notion of a \"young Earth\" is incompatible with believing that nuclear bombs exist. If scientists understand uranium well enough to set off a bomb, it's credible to date the age of the Earth with it, too. If the Earth is only 6,002 years old, then uranium isotope dating does not work, and by extension, nor should atomic and hydrogen bombs.\n \n Drawing a distinction between the uranium in nuclear warheads and in old rocks isn't even splitting hairs. It's splitting atoms.\n",
