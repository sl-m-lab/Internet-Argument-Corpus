   "There's more to the story on kids singing to Obama:\n \nFox News scrubs any mention of school death threat in kids-sing-for-Obama story\n September 25, 2009 8:19 am ET by Eric Boehlert\n Foxnews.com posted an item about the right-wing crusade yesterday to vilify young school children in N.J. who sang the praise of the president Obama during a Black History Month event. In that original report, the Fox update noted [emphasis added]:\n \nThe tension at B. Bernice Young Elementary School escalated to such a degree Thursday that the school was placed temporarily on lockdown after its principal received death threats over a YouTube video that showed nearly 20 children being taught songs lauding the president, though back-to-school night events continuing as planned Thursday night at the school.\n\n Soon after though, the Fox news report had been scrubbed of any mention of looming violence; it had been scrubbed of any notion that right-wing crazies apparently called the school and were threatening to kill the principal.\n\n Fox NewsXscrubsXany mention of school death threat in kids-sing-for-Obama story | Media Matters for America\n \n I guess Michelle Malkin had a hissyfit and set off a bunch of gun-toting cuckoos.",

Here, check out just the 2008 exemplars: Fraud Map :: Rotten Acorn ::\n \n Now back to the meat of your foolish drivel:\n\n \n Archie now more than ever your grasp at straws and your fallacy and assumption astounds me. If you accuse me of merely attempting by some way of wit or word to sound intelligent then by all means your words prove that you will come by any means to try and prove your point.\n \n Hitler seized emergency powers after being appointed chancellor of the Reich. To say that Hitler's \"election\" was fair and even more credible than Obama's borders upon sheer stupidity.. Or have you forgotten perhaps of the night of the long knives and those who strove for the same power that Hitler obtained?\n \n \n \n \nLet me clearly say that if I believed that Obama's socialized healthcare takeover would accomplish any of what you claim above, then I would support it as good and positive legislation. Mine, and every other opponents issue with this legislation is that the reality doesn't jive with the claimed benefits he is promising. \n\n \n What is mere claim Archie? That a majority of Americans would be insured? That the precondition limitations would be striken down? That perhaps life and the quality thereof would maybe improve? Do not speak just upon Obama's so called claim.\n \n It is a bill endorsed by the AMA and numerous medical organizations. And once again it is not only Obama but those whom drafted the bill and those elected officials who voted for it. \n \n And if you want hard lined evidence simply look at the CBO score and the inner workings of the legislation. What is said upon black and white is not within some hidden meaning, and it does bring a myriad of reforms to a broken crumbling system that are desperately needed.\n \n \nSo don't accuse me of being against free medical care for the poor. Rightly credit me with speaking up now and defending them against legislation which will not only bankrupt the middle class and by default, the country I love but will ration healthcare for the poor, the elderly, and further victimize them as voiceless, powerless victims of the elite power brokers who will ultimately enslave them into an unfair system designed more to cement the political power of the left rather than accomplish anything it is promising regarding healthcare.\n\n \n Archie how is this to be done? If in a vain effort you play off of political dogma you accomplish little. You fail to see the benefits of this bill and even now with talk of expanding medicare to those within the 55-65 age bracket. Those whom are most vulnerable to the rising cost of insurance and those within a category of failing years of health...\n \n If thus is what you claim you have failed to either keep up to date on the current evolution of the bill, or you simply refuse to acknowledge any positive out of sheer blindness and predetermined allegiance stooped in hard lined party politics...\n \n \nI marvel that you accuse me of not caring about the underclass when it is you who is defending and supporting the very legislation which will create a permanent surf underclass which you, NOT ME will inevitably fall victim to. Remember jason, I am well established in life and can afford healthcare no matter what happens to this legislation. It is the people who are a month away from bankruptcy who will fall victim to the lies Obama is telling, and be captives to the system outlined in this unconstitutional legislation. Think about it my ignorant friend because you are arguing for the very noose which will enslave you to the yoke of slavery to a fascist government which these leftists envision for you.\n\n \n \n I marvel how you can twist the very veil of words to cover your sheer idiocy Archie. Simply since you are so well off and clearly state you will not be among the ranks of the downtrodden, it amazes me that you speak with such venom against it...\n \n If the bill does not affect you personally and may perchance aid others why be against it? because you are not in the dire straits these people are in.. You out of sheer ignorance and lack of understanding fail to grasp the simple truth that some reform and change is better than the untold suffering these countless people endure.\n \n Have you listened to those who have not seen a doctor in ten years? Those who go to donated free health clinics and receive care. Some are so astonished and moved by the volunteering and compassion, that they themselves come back as volunteers so others may receive care..\n \n Such is the desperate plight not only the lower class feel, but the middle and upper middle class as well. It is a dilemma that will only hurt this country more if we choose to ignore it. And daring to equate it to a form of fascist rule is simply not only sheer lunacy, but dares to show how entrenched your are in party politics to even dare see any good at all coming from others..",
