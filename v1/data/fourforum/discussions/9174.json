Ms. Pelosi has, after all, spent months now reminding us that she is not merely a capable leader, not just a whiz-bang political fund-raiser, but, first and foremost, \"a mother and a grandmother.\" \n \n That's lovely for her; but if Ms. Pelosi's experience of motherhood is to have any meaning for the rest of us, or any relevance to her life as a politician, we've got to see some follow-through. Because if, as Ms. Pelosi has repeatedly said, she'll be taking up the speaker's gavel \"on behalf of America's children,\" there's a lot of work to do. For children can't thrive if their families are stressed and, at every point on the socioeconomic spectrum now, it seems that American families are cracking at the seams.\n \n The Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law released a study last month noting that \"workplace inflexibility, the lack of family supports and workplace bias\" are forcing American mothers out of the work force - whether they can really afford to \"opt out\" or not. \n \n This comes on the heels of news articles showing how working-class moms are putting their youngsters in all-night child care, and how couples are increasingly enduring split-shift work schedules - putting their health and marriages at risk - to avoid the costs and anxieties of day care. All this paints a picture of family life in America that is very grim for all but the very privileged.\n \n For years now, there have been murmurings - and more - from various corners of Congress in favor of change. Representative Lynn Woolsey's Balancing Act bill, which calls for a wide array of measures to reduce the stresses on working families, has been languishing for years. Senators Christopher Dodd and Ted Kennedy have gestured toward legislation on paid family leave and guaranteed sick leave. There was even a much-overlooked bill introduced in the Senate by Hillary Clinton this summer (and in the House by Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut) to provide low-income parents with subsidies to stay at home and care for their infants themselves. \n \n It's time to light a fire under these kinds of initiatives. Ms. Pelosi's current promises - to raise the minimum wage, cut the interest rates on student loans and make some college tuition tax deductible - are a laudable start, but American families, whose needs have been increasingly neglected since the early 1980s, need so much more: quality after-school programs; national standards for child care; voucher programs and tax subsidies to help pay for that care; universal, voluntary public preschool; paid family leave; and incentives for businesses to make part-time and flex-time work financially viable. \n \n In short, we need to make the kind of glorious life that's enjoyed by upper-middle-class mothers and grandmothers like Ms. Pelosi and her colleagues possible for everyone else.\n \n This isn't a radical leftist agenda. In fact, there's no better antidote to the selfish individualism and empty materialism that Americans of all political stripes say is corrupting our country than policies that allow families to spend more, and better, time together. \n \n In recent years, pro-family Democrats were out in the legislative wilderness. Now, there's simply no excuse for inaction. It's time to shoot for the moon. Risk a presidential veto. And let the proponents of \"family values\" show their true colors.\n \n Judith Warner is the author of \"Perfect Madness: Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety\" and a contributing columnist for TimesSelect.",
