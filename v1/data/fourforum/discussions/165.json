   "Since this thread is really a continuation of the death penalty one in religion, I'll start by posting my latest reply. I'll assume that my readers are up-to-date as to what we all have been saying in the other debate, cause otherwise your gonna get kinda lost. \n \n So. \n \n Since I posted last quite a few things have happened: \n \n Falling, no, we cannot be executed for our thoughts. That is not the realm of the civil government. I'm sure you wouldn't suggest that the Old Testament laws were to be utilized in that way, cause they were not. \n As for my twisted idea of mercy... umm isn't it better to be a slave than to be dead? It's better than accepting the surrender and then killing them which has happened before. \n I cannot see how I'm giving Christianity a bad name! Because I state what I believe? What if I think you are giving us a bad name? \n \n Now thistown:\n I'll choose to ignore your first comment. \n \n Deuteronomy 23:2 \n \"Yes I suppose that death by stoning would be a pretty good incentive. but no one in their right mind would impose a law like this, no Christian at least.\"\n \n Uh huh, a very good incentive. I don't know why you think you cannot be in your right mind to impose this law! If you believe the whole Bible, you actually have no choice. \n \n Deuteronomy 21:18 \n \"Umm...I missed something, I read 3 different translations and none mention witchcraft. They mention laziness and drunkenness, but nothing of sorcery.\"\n \n Sorry, my mistake. The verse is 1 Samuel 15:23. I neglected to include the citation. :D\n \n Deuteronomy 20:11 \n This is not mercy...when someone surrenders you do not take them as your slave, take their women and children into bondage. Any nation present day who enslaved an entire culture in this manner would be seen on the same level as the Nazis. And I love how you use \"tributary\" instead of slave, makes it sound much more....\"merciful\".\n \n Why don't you take them as your slave? What do you do with them? Say, great, have a good day? Why do you think you are attacking them in the first place? Maybe cause they've done something to you? Remember, this is single cities, not entire nations that we are talking about here. \n Thx for your compliment about me using \"tributary\" instead of \"slave\" that's what it means in Hebrew. \n \n Exodus 20:21\n Pretty much just gave up on this one huh? Yes they will have to answer to God, but remember these were laws given to the governing body by God so....irrelevant.\n \n I guess I don't understand your point here... irrelevant? The idea is if the slave lives for a while before dying, the civil government must assume that he died of other causes.",

   "I'm sorry you are growing weary of \"restating\" your position, maybe if you'd find some other evidence we'd be able to move on. I do not know what you are trying to say, I've taken everything you've said at face value. \n \n \"You obviously (I hope) don't believe that some of these should become United States laws, but you believe that the one that you agree with should be. I am simply pointing out that your are selectively manipulating that which is \"the solemn and eternal word of God\" and the rest is...well you haven't addressed the rest yet, you've only avoided the issue by stating that I said \"cut off penis\" instead of circumcision and stating what the laws were designed to discourage.\"\n \n I don't believe they should become United States laws. They should be enacted at the state level. I am not \"selectively manipulating\" God's Word.... I've given a defense for every verse! How many times must I say it! I BELIEVE THE WHOLE BIBLE!!!!!!! What parts am I ignoring? I didn't ignore your Matthew 5 verses... I provided a rebuttal! I faithfully have answered every verse you've given me. It's very unfair of you to then accuse me of selectively applying the Word of God. \n As to your last sentence, I have nothing to do with that, it was calligirl. I don't care what your version says that is different from what my version says, it all ends up the same in the end. \n \n \"So here is my question, and for everyone's sake it's not a hard question, it's just a scary one to you. Why should the death penalty law from God carry over and the stone your child for being a fat, lazy drunk not? Why should the death penalty carry over and the death to all adulterers, or the law that the US must take all of any country we invade into slavery, or the no former pagans in the church laws, not apply? We can't have one without the other, in fact we can't have one without all of them. These laws come in a package, if you claim that they are the Laws of God (which I agree they are) and that Jesus's life and death didn't change them (which I think it did) then you have to believe that each and every one of them should be instated in the US law. Is that not perfectly clear? You can't call for the death penalty under God and ignore the rest.\"\n \n It's not hard or scary. My answer is: Why shouldn't the law of God carry over? I think all those things should be implemented. I have to study it further to see exactly how they will be implemented, but I think they should. So, is that not the answer you were looking for? THEY DO APPLY. Guess I didn't make that clear. \n \n \"And Patriot, you're stooping. Stop trying to demonize me into some Old Testament hating pagan just because you've run out of things to say. It doesn't make you look better, I promise.\"\n \n Well thistown, all I did was quote you....\n \n \"You know full well that I don't believe that the Old Testament laws are \"ridiculous\", \n \n Falling said that some of the o.t. laws were \"ridiculous\" so that wasn't aimed at you.\n \n \"you would like to believe that I did, because then you could simply dismiss my arguments. But I believe in the laws of the Old Testament, I believe they were from God. But I believe that a man named Jesus took them all and made them into two, \"Love the Lord with all your heart\", \"And love your neighbor as yourself.\" I think that he is the reason that we don't stone our children anymore, or eliminate or enslave (if they're lucky) entire cultures and civilizations, or still believe in taking the life of a man as property (for 7 years or whatever, it is against his will and it is without pay=slavery). These are not the laws of Jesus Christ, they are not a part of the new covenant...but you obviously believe that one of them is a part, unfortunately my friend you can't just take one. If it applies they all do. Simple as that.\"\n \n \n I'll take them all thx. :D Since this is now an Old Testament law debate, I'll take your last statement about \"taking the life of a man as property (for 7 years or whatever, it is against his will and it is without pay=slavery).\" If that's what you think slavery is, yes, it's slavery. So what. It will interest you to know that involuntary servitude, as a punishment, is still legal in the US, if you read the 13th Amendment. I think that's a good law. Say you steal something. You get caught. You are unable to restore it 2-4 times what you stole to the person you wronged (another OT law)... should you sit in prison? NO! you should work. Even if it's against your will. I think that's a good law. \n I don't think that the laws Jesus gave us as individuals interfere with the execution of justice. \n \n One more word on the death penalty... for any of the crimes in the Old Testament that carried the death penalty, there had to be 2-3 witnesses. (Deuteronomy 17:6) For many of the crimes, it's unlikely that the culprits will be caught UNLESS they are doing it openly. \n \n Also, I'd like to bring up.... Something I said a while ago. About how if the government was run on the rule of \"turn the other cheek\" we'd have anarchy. \n What I mean is, if that's the rule for government, we have no government. Sure, you can have legislatures, you can have courts, but they are unenforceable. Cause the rule is to \"turn the other cheek.\" Any kind of punishment is then illegitimate (fines aren't turning the other cheek, neither are jail sentances.) I don't know, maybe that's what you are saying. I just wanted to clarify that statement. \n As a matter of interest, falling, thistown, and others, what, in your opinion, SHOULD happen to murderers?\n \n The rest of the debate was on John 8:1-9. \n Who brought this woman to Jesus? The Pharisees. They were RELIGIOUS government. The religious government has no authority to take away life. \n Keeping that in mind, we also notice they are trying to trap Christ here. (verse 6). If Christ rules one way or the other, they are going to nail him. You will notice that when the question is first posed, Christ ignores it, and they have to repeat themselves for a while before He finally answers them. \n When he does answer, He doesn't say that what they say should happen to her is wrong or unjust. He just tells them, \"He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.\" One by one, her accusers leave. Christ declined to giver her the death penalty because a) it was none of His business. He didn't come to rule Israel in the civil realm, as many expected the Messiah would do. His kingdom was not of this world. Therefore, He had little to do with the civil government, something that is wholly of this world. B) She was forgiven because she was repentant (obviously) and Jesus had the power to forgive her sins. However, he warned her to \"sin no more.\" \n \n Finally, Tim asks (Equity, but I'll answer too): \n \n \"In Matthew 12 the pharisees caught the disciples of Jesus breaking the Sabbath Day. You know what the punishment for breaking the Sabbath Day was? It was the death penalty according to the Old Testament (Numbers 15:32-36). So why didn't Jesus want his disciples to be put to death? Do you really think that Jesus favored the death penalty?\n \n First of all, the example in Numbers is a one time deal... God didn't say that this was to be a general rule, I think He ordered this execution to show He was serious about this. \n Second, Jesus can do what he wants. His answer (ultimately) to the Pharisees was, \"For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.\" (vs. 8.) I seem to recall other exceptions to the sabbath rule... like the ox in the ditch. If your ox fell into a ditch on the sabbath, you were allowed to go and get him out. You were also permitted to go a certain distance on the sabbath. The spirit of the law is more important than the words of the law. (Original intent strikes again!!!) This rule is actually found in this chapter, verse 11. Deuteronomy 22:4 provides what must have been the basis for this law. \n \n Ok. Last but not least. I know we all agree on abortion (at least falling does). Why is abortion wrong?",
