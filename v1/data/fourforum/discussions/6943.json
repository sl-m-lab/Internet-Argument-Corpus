Employee theft, especially during seasonal periods of temporary help, always equaled shoplifting. And you're correct, the industry average percentage of slippage is incorporated into selling price markup to maintain desired margin.",

The toy thieves don't want quality products; their kids crave every lump of rubbish that is marketed on TV. \n \n The snag is that hardly anyone wants to buy toys that never wear out.

I`ve heard the argument that shop-keepers are responsible for increases in shop-lifting themselves (naturally not the individual shop-keeper, but the business as such) due to increasingly aggressive marketing ploys and commercials. They also want to cut costs and attract custumers by fronting each and every item making it accesible for thieves, but also more desireable for ordinary custumers.

I don`t think anyone would be interested in leveling \"moral blame\" at individual shop-keepers (or even them as a group) But when looking at it from a societal point of view when shop-keepers are demanding increased funding for patroling and investigating police units (something that would be financed with other peoples money) one should consider the possibility that their behaviour might be a problem as well. And if their behaviour is found to be a problem, one should perhaps expect them to foot the bill instead (by employing private security personel or increase store security).",
