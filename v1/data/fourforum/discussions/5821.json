   "Hey there,\n \n I thought it might be interesting to start a thread cataloging the various arguments for the objective moral status of homosexual activity, specifically whether it is morally permissable or morally impermissable. \n \n When you're posting your argument, please enumerate your premises, and label them as such (Premise 1, Premise 2, etc). Also, please show any intermediate steps that must be taken between your premises and your conclusion.\n \n Please don't post arguments that make the following mistakes: http://www.intrepidsoftware.com/fallacy/toc.php\n \n I'll start.\n \n Premise 1. Sexual activity is morally permissable when all of the following conditions are met: all of the participants freely consent, it has a positive emotional impact on the participants, and it has a positive social impact \n \n Premise 2. Homosexual activity may meet all of the requirements for the moral permissability of any sexual activity. \n \n Premise 3. If homosexual activity does not meet all of the requirements for the moral permissability of sex, then it is morally impermissable for reasons other than the sex of the participants.\n \n Conclusion: Therefore homosexual activity is morally permissable when it meets the over-arching requirements for morally permissable sexual activity, and only when it meets those requirements.",

   "Clerisian: \n \n Supposing that every hypothetical imperative is permissable seems to miss the point that hypothetical imperatives are permissable only when conditions are such that they are possible. A hypothetical imperative is only permissable where conditions are such that it is possible to obey said imperative, and no other action takes priority. \n \n Which, if I remember correctly, was Kant's point in his Foundations for the Metaphysics of Morals (probably better translated as The logical basis of morality) that only acting according to the categorical imperative was always permissable and therefore an unqualified good.\n \n Not killing people, in this sense then, is taking an action hypothetically preferable to killing people. It does not qualify as a single action, but as a set of actions defined by being other than the action of killing people. Perform any of these actions when presented with the choice of killing someone or not and you perform an action that does not kill people.\n \n Going back to homosexual sex, to say that it's okay is to say that it is categorically good, which is false. We can easily imagine all sorts of situations, circumstances if you will, where engaging in homosexual sex is the wrong thing to do - such as when you're supposed to be operating heavy machinery, or your partner isn't consenting, or when you should be comforting your partner. So homosexual sex is not categorically good, like sex in general, but hypothetically good depending on the situation, the participants, and their relationship. \n \n When you're dealing with hypothetically good actions, you have to deal with options. Given the choice of a set of hypothetically permissable actions, the negation of some actions may not be morally permissable or may indirectly lead to other morally non-permissable actions. The fact that these options exist, and appear equally permissable out of context and out of relation to each other, suggests that they are only equally permissable in the abstract. Put into context where there's only one action that you get to choose, your options may be sorted by their permissability to determine which action is the most permissable action. So if you're going to determine what is morally permissable you have to also determine what is morally preferable. \n \n To my mind deciding what to do, what action to take, is an ethical decision as much as any abstract theorizing. Ethics is, after all, about what we should be doing. If you want to describe a normative state of affairs, then noting what is abstractly permissable describes what is abstractly permissable rather than saying what should be abstractly permissable. \n \n Onto the issue of having sex with people that you later find out are bad people, and that you don't want to nurture a relationship with. Finding out that the person you just had good sex with is a jerk does not retroactively make the sex a bad thing. Much like consent is not retroactively applicable, neither is the quality of sex retroactively plastic. \n \n You may notice something about the counter-example that you raised. First you have sex, and it's good, and then you find out that the person you had sex with is a bad person. Like having bad sex and then finding out that the person you had sex with is a good person, consequent events do not change the moral permissability of an action because that permissability is determined prior to an action and not afterwards.\n \n Certainly you can go back and review your moral decisions with the benefit of hindsight, but unless that retrospective evaluation shows willful ignorance or willful error, then you can't fault yourself for being ignorant of important details or making mistakes in reasoning. At most I think you can only learn to be more careful and knowledgeable in the future, if those previous mistakes were honest. There's no point in regretting something that you couldn't have changed, and saying something is now morally impermissable in hindsight when it was morally permissable in foresight. \n \n Oh, and sorry about the long delay - I took off camping for the Canada Day weekend.",
