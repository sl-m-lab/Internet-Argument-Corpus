   "Pgh. Police Could Soon Have Increased Fire Power\n \n It has been three weeks since three Pittsburgh police officers were shot and killed in Stanton Heights. \n \n Now, Pittsburgh police will be stepping up their firearms capabilities. \n \n On April 4th, officers left their vehicles and faced a man with an assault rifle. \n \n The officers were only armed with 9mm service pistols. \n \n The police department vowed their officers will never be outgunned again. \n \n The end result is that the city approved the purchase of 46 Smith & Wesson M&P 15 rifles, the same as those used by the city's SWAT unit. \n \n Each weapon will cost the city about $1,200. \n \n Federal grants are going to help pay for them. \n \n Every officer will be trained on how to use the new weapons. \n \n They'll be used beginning in June.\n \n News of the new fire power comes as a group called Coalition Against Violence expressed sympathy for the fallen officers and asked for more gun legislation. \n \n \"We feel strongly that the meaning and intention of the second amendment had nothing to do with providing criminals and unstable, misguided individuals with weapons to kill police officers and the residents of our neighborhood, including our women and our children,\" said Tim Stevens, of Coalition Against Violence. \n \n Meanwhile, second amendment advocates say that there are more than enough laws on the books. \n \n They simply need to be enforced. \n \n Pgh. Police Could Soon Have Increased Fire Power With New Weapons - kdka.com\n \n I was listening to the radio, Marty Griffin to be exact. It seems the same pinheads that whined and cried and swore Florida would turn into a wild west show with blood running in the streets are using the exact buzz words here. Aming the police will A) escalate the problem or B) turn the police into crazed cowboys gunning down the populace. Go figure, you would think in the light of the tragedy here peeps would be in favor of up gunning the police. Once upon a time here the patrol cars had Reising submachines in them. It just goes to show once a pinhead, always a pinhead. ",

They will want to be able to gun down their opponents before they get gunned down.

You, and believe your motive and believe that they Anti-gunners will stop, or do we take the Anti-gun Anti-2nd Amendment people at their word and believe that they will do what they said they would do. Just how foolish do you think we should be.\n \n Another example. One Alquida member says they only want just that one country, Afghanistan. Should we just hand it over and see if the rest of Alquida will stop there? Or should we already act on what we know for an absolute fact! They will take what ever they can get and will never stop.\n \n  Rights and Responsibilities  \n Fundamental Rights\n \n This relationship of citizen and state is fundamental to democracy. In the words of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776:\n \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\n \n More specifically, in democracies, these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of assembly, and the right to equal protection before the law. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy, but it does constitute a set of the irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold. Since they exist independently of government, in Jefferson's view, these rights cannot be legislated away, nor should they be subject to the whim of an electoral majority.\n\n \n   The Bill of Rights \n \"The Bill of Rights guarantees Americans' freedoms, but citizens must ensure their rights are protected,\" former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor says.\n\n \n Sorry Sinjin, urinate on someone else back and tell them that you are a meteorologist.",

   "(Stolen quote from John Lott) I am wondering what our Founding Fathers would have had to actually write in the 2nd Amendment if they actually meant Shall Not Infringe! :) \n \n However Sinjin, it should be noted that, although not absolute, the 2nd Amendment was put directly into the Constitution to stop government, and you, from running rough shod all over our Inalienable Rights. Heller does not give you card blanch to make up every law you guys can think of. \n \n The 2nd Amendment was put into the Constitution as one more check in our system of checks and balances. How did the preamble to the Bill of Rights put it? \n \n   Preamble Bill of Rights \n THE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution\n\n Restrictive against Government.\n \n In arguing against a Bill of Rights   Alexander Hamilton Federalist Papers no. 84 \n I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted; and on this very account, would afford a colourable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why for instance, should it be said, that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that power.\"\n\n But it kind of sounds to me that you guys are calming that power after Heller. The Bill of Rights is for our protection from you and the Government's usurpation of our inalienable Rights. \n \n Yosemite Sam says it best on those truck mud flaps! Back Off! :)",

   "And that was true long before they enacted their draconian gun control too.

   "So the reason they had lower gun crime rates was because the police in those countries were doing a much better job than in the US or was it because they had low rates of gun ownership even before the passage of new gun laws?\n\n How can I best put this? First of all please understand that I am happy that not everyone has a drug gang problems of the U.S. and Mexico.   National Gang Threat Assessment Issued \nCriminal gangs commit as much as 80 percent of the crime in many communities, according to law enforcement officials throughout the nation. Typical gang-related crimes include alien smuggling, armed robbery, assault, auto theft, drug trafficking, extortion, fraud, home invasions, identity theft, murder, and weapons trafficking.\n\n \n Be that as it may, the reason England, Australia, Japan etc, had and has less murders is probably best attributed to socialization. Although the drug gang culture is changing this to an extent. \n \n However, crime fighting is done by police, good equipment, and training. I give credit to our crime drop in the United States to Clinton's 100,000 new cops on the street program, our emphasis on crime fighting, training, better equipment, and the 3 strikes laws passed by congress. See   From the U.S. Department of Justice Statistics.  \n \n England, after year after year of crime rate rise, See   A quarter of English are victims of crime \n England and Wales were second only to Australia in the examination of \"victimisation rates\", details of which appeared in the Economist. There was a downward trend in crime levels from previous surveys in 1991 and 1999. People in England and Wales were at greater risk than anywhere else of having their cars stolen: 2.6 per cent fell victim to vehicle theft.\n \n See graph on page 7 of this PDF publication from   Canada's bureau of justice statistics. Results of the 2000 International Crime Victimization Survey \n \n This trend continued even till recently. See   Britain tops European crime league \n \n ***************** And now the change!\n \n However I believe they are reversing this trend with good police work instead of trying to control the law-abiding. See   Manchester: 'Streets safer after jailing of Gooch Gang members' \n Martin Wainwright reports from Moss Side, where shootings, murders and drug offences have plummeted after the jailing of members of the 'Gooch Gang'\n \n   Boris Johnson defends steep rise in police use of stop and search \n London police carry out stops every three minutes - contributing to fall in knife crime, says mayor Boris Johnson \n \n But he said he believed that stop and search powers had contributed to a successful reduction in knife crime in the capital, which has dropped 13% in the last year.\n \n and the one I referenced above. 'This is the police... lock your doors and windows': Officers shout warnings to homeowners through megaphones in burglary crackdown | Mail Online\n \n Crime fighting is not a mystery we know the contributing factors.\n   Crime factors from the FBI website\n Historically, the causes and origins of crime have been the subjects of investigation by many disciplines. Some factors that are known to affect the volume and type of crime occurring from place to place are:\n \u00b7 Population density and degree of urbanization. \n \u00b7 Variations in composition of the population, particularly youth concentration. \n \u00b7 Stability of population with respect to residents' mobility, commuting patterns, and transient factors. \n \u00b7 Modes of transportation and highway system. \n \u00b7 Economic conditions, including median income, poverty level, and job availability. \n \u00b7 Cultural factors and educational, recreational, and religious characteristics. \n \u00b7 Family conditions with respect to divorce and family cohesiveness. \n \u00b7 Climate. \n \u00b7 Effective strength of law enforcement agencies. \n \u00b7 Administrative and investigative emphases of law enforcement. \n \u00b7 Policies of other components of the criminal justice system (i.e., prosecutorial, judicial, correctional, and probational). \n \u00b7 Citizens' attitudes toward crime. \n \u00b7 Crime reporting practices of the citizenry. \n\n This is not rocket science. Crime in my neighborhood for instance is non existent! However, the crime rate in our Inner Cities is atrocious! The right question becomes, how can we make our Inner Cities like my neighborhood.",

Just because these countries have very strict gun control, that's not grounds for assuming that this is the sole and exclusive reason for lower crime rates.",
