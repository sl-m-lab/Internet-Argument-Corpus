You don't even really understand what it was, what it did, and WHY it successfully proved the point in the first place cause you don't understand what \"mental illness\" means in the first place.\n \n There are obviously \"murder\" cases out there that don't involve a \"mentally ill\" killer, right?\n So if a psychiatrist declares \"this killer is not mentally ill\", does that somehow \"legitimize\" the killing? NO!\n Adultery is not a \"mental illness\", right? Does the fact that it is not a mental illness somehow mean it is \"legitimized\"? NO!\n \n People like you have a serious problem understanding words. You confuse two issues, like \"natural\" when what you really mean is \"moral\".\n And when it comes to homosexuality, stating the obvious that it is NOT a \"mental illness\" does not somehow mean it is \"legitimized\".\n \n \n \nNow, would you like me to repost multiple independent sources which ALL point out the fraud and deceptions that Hookers study was based on?\n\n I would like you to truthfully address the subject matter first.\n Stop with the attempts to change the subject.\n Stop with the attempts to lie about what I said.\n \n If you want to start a separate thread, be my guest.\n I'll happily show how you're clueless about the claims there. Cause in reality, the claims regarding Hooker attempt to reach false conclusions based on shoddy claims.\n But I'm not about to let you distract from the REAL issue of this thread.\n THIS thread is ABOUT REFUTING the false conclusion.\n \n Removing homosexuality from the mental illness list WAS and IS justified.\n There is NO real reason why it should be there in the first place.\n \n \n \nHold on a second Tonto, you very clearly said this in your op.

Like cleaning your house wouldn't be mentally ill, but scrubbing the kitchen utensils 18 times with bleach until your own hands are cracked from chemicals IS a sign of mental illness.\n It's not the CLEANING that is the problem.\n \n With that said, do you know WHAT the change was to???\n I'm betting you don't.",

   "The whole basis of the Scentific Method is that conclusions are continually--not just when they are arrived at initially, but FOREVER--subjected to analysis by professionals of equal expertise and experience, regardless of their own personal opinions or feelings on the subject being tested.\n \n All experimental results are subject to review--FOREVER--by other qualified professionals, regardless of their political or social views. And if those views conflict with the results arrived at (hey, it happens) you can bet your last dime they'll do their damndest to find fault with them. \n \n And if it transpires that the original researcher's findings are, in fact, colored by bias or methodically flawed, you can be damn sure their dogged analyses will expose it. \n \n And if THEIR findings are biased or otherwise at fault, you can be sure that subsequent analyses by FURTHER analysts will eventually uncover that as well. \n \n And so on, and so on, and so on...\n \n See how it works?\n \n It's called the SCIENTIFIC METHOD.\n \n And the whole idea behind it is to little by little figure out how our world operates the way it does... all the time keeping scrupulous watch on how we arrive at our conclusions, so we can know they're sound and free of bias, faulty methodology, or anything else that might taint them.\n \n Homophobic scientists who don't WANT Hooker's results to be true (and there are still plenty, from Cameron on up) have had more than FIFTY FRIGGIN YEARS to disprove them, via that solid, logical, time-tested method. \n \n Yet they haven't been able to--not even with a half century's behavioral science further knowledge to draw on.\n \n Gee, why IS that, do ya think?\n \n So it stands to reason that anyone who maintains, at this late date, that Hooker's conclusions are invalid should either (a) seriously examine his own prejudices and reasoning processes, or (b} submit detailed evidence that disprove them --with accompanying scientific credentials, of course--to a reputable journal or scientific organization. \n \n If it's the latter, I have no doubt he will make the covers of Newseek, Time, and every major media outlet in the country, be subjected to endless interviews, make a tidy fortune, and be regaled by myriad well-funded anti-gay (Christian) groups as the Savior of our land for finally quashing the dread \"gay agenda,\" currently dooming (in ways yet unspecified) the sacred institution of marriage.\n \n Unless of course his claims are BS, in which case he should explain why he shouldn't just shut up and stop spewing fictitious, acrimonious #### about gay people 4+ times a frickin day.",

A disorder is an abnormal physical or mental condition.\n \n The seminal scientific study used to normalize homosexuality appeared in 1957. Dr. Evelyn Hooker claimed that \"homosexuals [are] not inherently abnormal and that there [is] no difference between the pathologies of homosexual and heterosexual men.\" [3 Hooker, E., \"The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual\" (Journal of Projective Techniques, 1957, \n 21, 18-31)] \n An honest scientist would have rigorously obeyed the rules for scientific experimentation in performing the tests on her hypothesis that male homosexuals will be indistinguishable in their performance on standard projective tests from male heterosexuals.\n \n An honest scientist would have used the existing standardized projective tests for psychopathology. Hooker ignored the existing standardized tests and invented her own.\n \n Hooker should have selected two groups of men, one homosexual, the other heterosexual, that were carefully matched for characteristics and who were kept ignorant of the purpose of the study.\n \n Instead, Hooker deliberately recruited homosexual men with the help of homosexual activist groups who told the homosexual men the purpose of the study was to transform society's attitudes towards homosexuality. She later boasted publicly that, \"I knew the men for whom the ratings were made, and I was certain as a clinician that they were relatively free of psychopathology.\" [14 American Psychologist, April 1993 Vol. 48, No. 4, 450-453] She deliberately screened out subjects who admitted to being in therapy for mental or emotionally problems, thus insuring there was little risk of too many people revealing pathological symptoms on her projective tests.\n \n During her experiment Hooker was shocked to discover that her male homosexual subjects were revealing aspects of their personalities that conflicted with her theory. Each of her subjects was initially to be evaluated with three well-known psychological tests. When Hooker found that two of the three tests easily distinguished homosexuals from heterosexuals, Hooker simply omitted the results of the two tests that proved her hypothesis was wrong from her report.\n \n This piece of fraudulent garbage was the primary \"scientific\" report relied on by the American Psychiatric Association to decide that homosexuality was not a medical disorder.\n \n In 1965 Dr. Judd Marmor, a psychiatrist at UCLA, picked Hooker to be the chairman of the National Institute of Mental Health Task Force on Homosexuality. Marmor soon became Vice President of the American Psychiatric Association.",

From the site itself:\n About this site\n \n This website discusses various issues related to the preservation of Western culture and the ethnic genetic interests (EGI) of people of European ancestry. This site does not argue that the EGI and cultural concerns of non-European people are less important than those of people of European ancestry.\n \n Most materials within this site are presented in the format of a blog and the general public is allowed to comment on blog entries. We welcome opposing viewpoints, but in order to have a scholarly discussion, we request commentators to avoid the use of profanity and ad hominem attacks.\n \n The reader will find a variety of viewpoints discussed within this site, which sometimes lead to a heated debate, even among the bloggers.\n \n Since the site admins respect freedom of speech, it is inevitable that some readers, including the admins themselves, will find some comments or entries offensive. However, it should be kept in mind that all entries and comments within this site reflect the viewpoints of their respective authors and cannot be assumed to be held by others commenting or posting on this site. On the other hand, comments inciting others to criminal activity will be deleted and repeat offenders will be banned from posting. The site admins neither endorse nor condone criminal behavior for any purpose.\n Regarding the post below, I know you want to focus on labeling me a WHITE SUPREMIST but the posts it leads to are not affiliated with that site. And I make absolutely no apologies for using that link because the information in the link you're labeling as a white supremacist site perfectly agrees with the other 2 objective sites that say exactly the same thing as it say's regarding the fraud of the Hooker Study.\n \n So demonize it as you may, it is perfectly honest and accurate in what it say's about the Hooker Study. Just to repeat for the dim witted out there, the web site isn't the reason I referred to it, because I have never heard of that web site. But when I googled \"evidence for Hookers fraudulent study\" this was just one of many links that came up. So I used the link for that info only.  If it is a truly racist organization, I doubt they would embrace an Arab with an arabic name as I have anyway, so to imply that I have anything in common with white supremacists is both disingenuous and defamatory. \n \n Now, If you dare deal with actual facts, read the links below in order to see the overwhelming evidence of what the Hooker study has accomplished in the real world based on completely corrupted scientific methodology.\n \n \nThere ya go again foundit. You can't refute the info, so attack the source of that info. Well here are two more independent sites that say the same thing about the quality of Hookers study. http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=316420&postcount=47\n \n And here is evidence that Hookers fraudulent work was used by Laud Humphreys, another promoter of the normalization of homosexuality as evidence to support his claims. http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=316456&postcount=56 This is the danger that fraudulent work poses in the real world.

   "LIE\n\n An honest scientist would have used the existing standardized projective tests for psychopathology. Hooker ignored the existing standardized tests and invented her own. \n\n TRUTH\n She chose to use 3 accepted \"projection\" tests that were popular at the time, the Rorschach (inkblot) test, some draw-a-picture test and another I can't remember. She did not administer these tests but they were performed independently by experts, and interpreted by others who were blinded to the sexuality of the subjects.\n \n LIE\nHooker should have selected two groups of men, one homosexual, the other heterosexual, that were carefully matched for characteristics and who were kept ignorant of the purpose of the study.\nTRUTH\n That's exactly what she did. This was a case control study. She chose to look two matched groups, one hetero, one homo and see if there was any difference between them with regard to psychopathology. She got a grant from the NIMH. You don't get grants without a sound research design - plain and simple. Adding to this, the research was published in a peer reviewed journal. The peers in 1957 were NOT uniformly warm and fuzzy about homos. \n \n \n \n LIE\n\n Instead, Hooker deliberately recruited homosexual men with the help of homosexual activist groups \n\n TRUTH\n To recruit the homos, she looked to the Mattachine Society, a homophilic organization in the 50's. If you can think of any other way of recruiting gay men in 1957, I would like to hear it. Certainly it was not a random sample, as this would be stupid. She was looking for a particular attribute, homosexuality. Now, the limitation of this approach would be if members of that organization differed in mental illness from gays not in that organization. I don't see how that would necessarily be true or that any difference would substantively matter with regard to mental illness. Neither did the reviewers nor anyone else among her colleagues. It is a valid method.\n \n \n LIE\n...who told the homosexual men the purpose of the study was to transform society's attitudes towards homosexuality. \n\n \n TRUTH.\n 1. It's not true.\n 2. Even if it was, that doesn't change the results of psych testing or results of the study.\n \n LIE\n\n She later boasted publicly that, \"I knew the men for whom the ratings were made, and I was certain as a clinician that they were relatively free of psychopathology.\" \n\n \n TRUTH\n 1. She may or may not have known them. Don't see how she could have before the fact anyway.\n 2. Even if she did, that doesn't change the results of psych testing.\n \n \n \n LIE\n\n She deliberately screened out subjects who admitted to being in therapy for mental or emotionally problems, thus insuring there was little risk of too many people revealing pathological symptoms on her projective tests. \n\n \n TRUTH\n \n Previous studies of homos were taken only from those with mental illness. She sought to avoid this bias. At any rate, they were matched with the heteros with respect to past history of treatment for mental illness. \n \n \n LIE\n\n During her experiment Hooker was shocked to discover that her male homosexual subjects were revealing aspects of their personalities that conflicted with her theory. \n\n \n TRUTH\n Too stupid to even comment on.\n \n LIE\n\n Each of her subjects was initially to be evaluated with three well-known psychological tests. When Hooker found that two of the three tests easily distinguished homosexuals from heterosexuals, Hooker simply omitted the results of the two tests that proved her hypothesis was wrong from her report. \n\n TRUTH\n All three tests were used. Hooker did not interpret the tests, but were done with independent expert in the use of those tests were blinded to the sexual orientation of the subjects. \n \n LIE\n\n This piece of fraudulent garbage was the primary \"scientific\" report relied on by the American Psychiatric Association to decide that homosexuality was not a medical disorder. \n\n TRUTH\n Many studies have subsequently corroborated her findings. No decision like this would be made on the basis of a single study. No subsequent studies have contradicted these findings.\n \n TRUTH\n It is tedious to post the same things repeatedly to someone who doesn't care about the truth. It is futile to expect the XXXXX to understand this. First, I think he is as dumb as a box of hair and second, he will never understand something that contradicts his fixed delusional system. I wasted the effort only for any newcomers who have not seen his psychotic rants repeatedly refuted in the past.",

She did not administer these tests but they were performed independently by experts, and interpreted by others who were blinded to the sexuality of the subjects.\n\n \n Got a link to any confirming evidence at all that anything you claim here is even the least bit true? Are we to just accept your biased opinion instead of my multiple objective sources that all come to the same conclusions regarding Hookers shoddy and fraudulent methodology, just because you took the time to type this drivel out?\n \n \nTRUTH\n That's exactly what she did. This was a case control study. She chose to look two matched groups, one hetero, one homo and see if there was any difference between them with regard to psychopathology. She got a grant from the NIMH. You don't get grants without a sound research design - plain and simple. Adding to this, the research was published in a peer reviewed journal. The peers in 1957 were NOT uniformly warm and fuzzy about homos. \n\n \n Got a link to any confirming evidence at all that anything you claim here is even the least bit true?

If you can think of any other way of recruiting gay men in 1957, I would like to hear it. Certainly it was not a random sample, as this would be stupid. She was looking for a particular attribute, homosexuality. Now, the limitation of this approach would be if members of that organization differed in mental illness from gays not in that organization. I don't see how that would necessarily be true or that any difference would substantively matter with regard to mental illness. Neither did the reviewers nor anyone else among her colleagues. It is a valid method.\n\n \n Got a link to any confirming evidence at all that anything you claim here is even the least bit true?

It is futile to expect the XXXXX to understand this. First, I think he is as dumb as a box of hair and second, he will never understand something that contradicts his fixed delusional system. I wasted the effort only for any newcomers who have not seen his psychotic rants repeatedly refuted in the past.\n\n \n Yes moose, I agree. It is tedious to continue to post the same information repeatedly and have it denied by people who don't care about the truth. And that statement perfectly describes the homosexual community around here. All any objective observer need do is follow the thread in question which led to the start of this thread, and they can see who is in denial around here.

I would be interested in knowing who published your article. Any idiot can write an article. \n \n You fail to realized (among, apparently, quite a few things) that the previous consideration of homosexuality as an abnormality was never based in science, but was merely an opinion, albeit a widely held one. The APA changed its position because there was science that showed, based on criteria by which we judge heterosexuality as normal, the same held true for homosexuality. They spoke nothing of choice; that concept is just the tired rhetoric that so many of the uninformed buy into. There are objective criteria upon which we declare a person mentally healthy or not. There is no difference between heteros and homos. You may argue with those criteria if you like, but they hold true across the spectrum of sexual orientations.\n \n You seem to fancy yourself as a clever wordsmith, but your thought processes, if they exist, are rather inscrutable. Social relevance is always subjective. I don't think the APA cares about its relevance to anyone but the mental health scientists. It seems apparent, that you don't find science relevant, at least the outcomes of scientific research you don't happen to like.\n \n Lastly, w.t.f. does \"la raza\" have to do with anything in this context except a ham-handed attempt on your part to sound with it?",
