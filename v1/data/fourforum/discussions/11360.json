   "I own many firearms but normally carry a 1911 .45 ACP or my Ruger .357. \n \n These are big guns to carry. In the summer, I carry a PPK or Glock 26, but when the weather is cold, I carry my handcannons. \n \n Why?\n \n When I was 17 I witnessed a dozen or so of my friends get held up by two pieces of filth with shotguns at the restaurant I was working for. I saw our dishwasher get led out of the kitchen with a sawed off shotgun to the back of his head. These two guys came in with a dining room full of people, a kitchen staffed to the gills and had the balls to hold everyone up. There was at least a few dozen people there. \n \n So, that was it. I came to the logical conclusion that guns are indeed necessary and that banning guns only removes them from the hands of descent people. Criminals will always have guns. The Chinese have been smuggling weapons into the USA for decades. They will ALWAYS be available to bad people that want to use them against good people. Its quite simple. \n \n People that lobby govt to ban guns or promote gun control AID tyranny and oppression. They believe govt is God and that \"authority\" will always be there to wipe their bottoms. \n \n They live in a fantasy world. \n \n Stay free...buy guns. :)",

   "At the risk of becoming embroiled in a seemingly heated exchange, I think I might interject with a little history....\n \n To answer Smiley's question: \"who wrote the constitution?\" \n \n I would say the answer is found in the preamble to the document: \n \n \"We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\" (bold emphasis added)\n \n To answer Iangb's question: \"Who determines your rights, if not the government?\"\n \n I would say the people do. We created the government, we forced it to recognize in its charter certain rights we hold dear. The government is not entitled to re-determine these rights, or to pick and choose which ones it will honor and which ones it will ignore. \n \n To answer Smiley's question: \"Were these rights self-evident before the writing of the constitution?\"\n \n I would also say the rights which we see protected in the Bill or Rights were self-evident, did pre-exist the Constitution, and are not dependent on the document for existence. I cannot find a reference to \"self-evident\" rights in my Constitution. I did find, however, a claim of \"self-evident\" pre-existing \"natural law\" rights in the Declaration of Independence: \n \n When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. \n \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness....\n \n Now I contend the Bill of Rights did not \"create\" any rights, it merely recognized those natural (or call them common law derived if you wish) rights which were accepted by our founders as belonging to all free men. \n \n This concept is not new or novel in America:\n \n \"The right there specified is that of bearing arms for a lawful purpose. This is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence.\" United States v. Cruishank, 92 U.S. 542, 552 (1876) (speaking of the 2nd. Amendment)\n \n \"The law is perfectly well settled that the first ten Amendments to the Constitution, commonly known as the Bill of Rights, were not intended to lay down any novel principles of government, but simply to embody certain guarantees and immunities which we inherited from our English ancestors.\" Robertson v. Balwdin, 165 U.S. 275, 281-82 (1897).\n \n ---\n \n \"The fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject, that I shall present mention, is that of having arms for their defense, suitable to their condition and degree and such as are allowed by law. Which is also declared by the same statute W & M st. 2.c.2. [ie. The English Bill of Rights] and it is indeed a public allowance under due restrictions, of the natural right of resistance and self-preservation, when the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression. In these several articles consist the rights, or as they are frequently termed, the liberties of Englishmen. . . .And we have seen that these rights. . .consist, primarily, in the free enjoyment of personal security, of personal liberty, and of private property. So long as these remain inviolate, the subject is perfectly free; for every species of compulsive tyranny and oppression must act in opposition to one or other of these rights. To preserve these from violation, it is necessary that the constitution of parliaments be supported in it[s] full vigor. . . .And lastly, to vindicate these rights, when actually violated or attacked, the subjects of England are entitled, in the first place, to the regular administration and free course of justice in the courts of law; next to the right of petitioning the king and parliament for redress of grievances; and lastly, to the right of having and using arms for self preservation and defense.\" Sir William Blackstone, 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England, p. 136 & 140 (1st. ed. 1765, reprinted 1979).\n \n \"And I cannot see, why arms should be denied to any man who is not a slave, since they are the only true badges of liberty. . . .The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave. He who has nothing, and belongs to another, must be defended by him, and needs no arms: but he who thinks he is his own master, and has anything he may call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself and what he possesses, or else he lives precariously and at discretion. And though for a while those who have the sword in their power abstain from doing him injury; yet, by degrees, he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command. Our ancestors, by being always armed, and frequently in action, defended themselves against the Romans, Danes, and English; and maintained their liberty against encroachments of their own princes.\" Andrew Fletcher, Political Works, pp. 35 and 221 (1749).\n \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, Lecture II, 1921.",

While we have not yet perfected a method of reliably predicting exactly what some perp will do if left in control with a gun in his hand in a crowded mall, we can assume that more harm will come if he is not taken down and disarmed. The fact that a citizen may legally have a gun in his pocket capable of knocking down a large animal rather than a pea-shooter that will only make it mad is comforting to me. I like big guns, too.\n \n I can agree somewhat with the idea of hesitating to interfere when an altercation seems imminent, but I cannot agree that armed citizens should never \"endanger the lives of others\" by pulling his piece and firing at the perp.\n \n By the way, when you quote someone you should use their exact words, not your version of what they said...and you should apologize to sinjin for calling him an idiot.",

By law nobody can give any advice that has even the remote possibility of getting somebody hurt, even if the advise to lead to saving lives.\nAnd still you avoid giving a direct answer to the question. Now who's playing games?",
