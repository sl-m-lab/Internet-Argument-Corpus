When you use the term \"unmarried couples,\" do you mean in a casual relationship or a serious relationship? Honestly, how I see it, if there is enough love and they go through all the mental paperwork (prepared for any consequences at all) I don't really care what goes on between them but then again, I don't have a voyeurism thing so I don't want to watch either. As far as a couple living together, can that go under a common law marriage? That might depend on where you are. From how I understand it, back in April last year when my home state of Kansas decided to \"Protect Marriage\"emoticon_rolleyes by voting against gay marriage, they also eradicated the marriages of straight couples who were legally married by living together for at least 7 years. Some of those families have had children already there by making all the children in those kinds of families bastard children. (That's one reason why I do the whole roll-eye thing with \"protect Marriage.)\n \n I believe the main idea I was trying to say was that sex is supposed to be used to consummate a marriage or a relationship. It's not all the time (most of the time probibly) but that's the main point of it the first time. By the way, I don't think I specifically mentioned legal marriage.

   "Okay, well after marriage is the better time to have sex. I'm not saying the only time or the only right time but the better time. Just like abstance is the best way to not spread STD's. It's not the only way but it's the only 100% way to avoid it. After marriage is the better time to have sex because of so many reasons. I'm not saying here that you have to be married but that it is so much better.\n\n when talking about stds, then what youre referring to is permanent monogamy. this may or may not be linked to marriage. some married people cheat.\n \n i think i understand where youre coming from though. its not accurate to say that sex consumates a permanent monogamous relationship between people, because the reality is thats not the case. same with marriage, since divorce and adultery is so rampant. but i would imagine in the earliest days, there were no sermons and ceremonies. probably family members as witnesses. in some early genesis narratives, the scripture simply says that so-and-so 'took a wife', and in that scenario i suppose that was good enough to make it official. in those times, sex would be the crucial mark of that marriage union, but because a wife was also seen somewhat as \"property\" of her husband, even without them having sex the marriage would be established because the man said so\n \n \nBy the way, if I said that rape doesn't count as sex, would we be in agreement about that?\n\n i wouldnt agree. rape is non-consentual sex, which is sex. so rape counts as sex",
