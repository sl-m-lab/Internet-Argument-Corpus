   "In the past I disbelieved those who said that the Cyprus or rather Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus faded into nest of various radical groupings. But recently I've visited this part of Cyprus. And now I can testify in my own right that it is so. You know, some time ago Turkey decided to give shelter to various illegal Islamist groups and other dubious characters. At this moment Turkey certainly tries to get rid of such \"security risks\", because the country is zealous for EU entry. Maybe, that is why Turkish authorities began to finance removal of \"suspected elements\" to other countries, starting with the Cyprus, of course. And of special note is predominance of so-called Chechen rebels in this stream of refugees. They've moved there from the Caucasus for healing of wounds and then they usually prefer to stay at Turkey without date. It is obvious they are the most dangerous part of local criminal community and associations of radical Islamists, because they have great experience of terrorist activity and what is more, they successfully imitate European image. In other words, they are simply ideally suited for acting as agents of Islamic terrorists on the territory of our long-suffering Europe.",
