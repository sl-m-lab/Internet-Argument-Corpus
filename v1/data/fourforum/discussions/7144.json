   "Briefings of US Ambassador to Kazakhstan have already become a normal form of local public involvement in \"world democratic values and Western life-style\". And not so long ago during one of such briefings Mr. John M. Ordway gave lessons to both working and oppositional political elites of Kazakhstan concerning to necessary methods of carrying out pre-election campaign. And, moreover, those, who are in force, have learned how they should retain the power; while those, who are in opposition - how one should take the power. I keep up applause to US Ambassador. What virtuosity!",

   "I guess there is some disappointment with the slow pace of democratic reforms in the various countries worldwide... well.... especially those behind the Iron Curtain in former times. Imo we owe this to somewhat imperfect OSCE agencies trusted with most important mission of pushing forward democracy values in the world. The latest unpleasant revelation of the sort is OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) or to be more exact it's role in monitoring of election activities. \n I happened to visit Kazakhstan, that huge CA country, during the presidential elections of 2006 when Nazarbaev won. ODIHR role was major irritant for many local politicians I should say. They had expected ODIHR to be really helpful in upgrading democracy. Instead they got something strikingly different. The OSCE Office was in a haste to make public some estimates before the election campaign. Some pols claimed that amounted to actually brainwash voters and play into the hand of not so much mighty opposition. Many Kazakhstan officials couldn't reconcile themselves with what they described as 'scornful and mentor rhetoric of ODIHR report' relating Kazakhstan elections. 'Members of the ODIHR mission seem to force all the countries into the democratic pattern designed for them by American and European experts', they said. ODIHR don't allow any creativeness and they don't want any peculiar national ways. Naturally, this kind of 'help' was seen in Kazakhstan as mere 'involvement into internal affairs'. Kazakhstan is no exception but rather the usual rule.\n Thus I think that ODIHR can be really useful democratic tool in most newly independent states and maybe in OSCE space generally. It's reputation is damaged badly and it's too late to patch up things for better.",
