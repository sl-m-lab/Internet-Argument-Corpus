   "With all the hype lately that the issue of gay suicide has been getting in the news, a bit of reality is probably a good thing.\n \n Gay suicides and media hype\n \"The story of Tyler Clementi brings tears to the eyes. The Rutgers University freshman jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge after a video of him having sex with a man was posted on the Internet, probably by a classmate. Not only did a promising young life end &#8212; it&#8217;s 2010, and even college students still exhibit malicious anti-gay bias.\n \n Yet does his awful death mean there&#8217;s a &#8220;trend&#8221; of suicides by young gays and lesbians. That has been a television theme in the last week. It&#8217;s clear there have been suicides in which young homosexuals kill themselves at least in part owing to harassment. Each instance is heartbreaking. But people who aren&#8217;t gay, or don&#8217;t belong to any group that has been subjected to prejudice, take their own lives. Does the occurrence of a gay person&#8217;s suicide show any larger trend?\n \n In 2007, there were about 42 million Americans aged 15-24. The self-inflicted death rate for this group was about one in 10,300. That comes to roughly 4,000 suicides a year by those of teens-to-college age &#8212; a horrible figure. That suicide is a leading cause of death for young people is, itself, horrible.\n \n The exact figure is disputed, but a good estimate is that three to four percent of the human family is homosexual. Based on the suicide rate for those 15 to 24, we&#8217;d expect somewhere around 150 gay or lesbian young people to kill themselves in a year. That&#8217;s terrible &#8211; but also shows a few instances of gay suicide do not constitute a trend. This ABC News report laments &#8220;five suicides by gay teenagers in the last three weeks,&#8221; implying a sudden new development. Other things being equal, statistics would suggest nine suicides by gay young adults in a three-week period.\n \n Are homosexuals as a group at greater risk of suicide than others of similar backgrounds? This study found that gay young people who are rejected by their families are much more likely than their age group as a whole to attempt to kill themselves. But do heterosexual youth who are rejected by their families also have elevated suicide-attempt rates? Being rejected by your family would be traumatic regardless of the reason.\n (More at link above)\"Once again, the real issue is rejection, regardless of the reason. The answer isn't necessarily to always quell all objection and silence anyone who dares morally object to homosexual action. It's rather to educate society that objection isn't the same as rejection. The issue that has to be addressed therefore isn't 'gay suicide', but rather 'suicide', period. Proponents of the gay pride movement have done an effective job of equating objection with rejection as if they are the same, but to equate the two is fallacious. The idea of loving someone unconditionally should not require a moralistic 'blank check' (so to speak) for any and all behaviors.",

You can&#8217;t declare that homosexuality is immoral and disgusting, and then act surprised (and take no responsibility) when a homosexual feels self-loathing at hearing that. &#8220;Objecting to homosexuality&#8221; is fine if you decide for yourself that you will not personally be a homosexual, but when you pronounce homosexuals as deviants, and this is promoted as a widely accepted position, you have crossed the line and are part of the problem. If I am told that I am &#8220;objectionable&#8221;, it naturally follows that I would feel rejected &#8211; these two processes are not separable, no matter how much you would like them to be. \n If teen suicide is something that we decide is undesirable, and a common cause is widespread homophobia, it seems reasonable to address homophobia in addition to the larger issue of teen suicide related to other causes. I cannot see how you could &#8220;object&#8221; to addressing a direct cause.\n I know you want to feel OK about yourself when you publicly &#8220;object&#8221; to homosexuality, but you have to face the fact there are consequences to those broadcasting those sentiments.",

I am not suggestiing stiflling your free speech (gag order); I am saying that speech is harmful. And human sexuality is not just any other action.\n \n You are trying to euphemize your behavior by calling it \"objecting\" to homosexuality. First, I don't know what that means. It makes about as much sense as objecting to glaciers. Homosexuality is a fact of our human condition. Those that are homosexual cannot change. You are not dispassionately objecting to something trivial, you are condemning something that makes us human beings.\n \n Telling a gay person that homosexuality is wrong is not the same as telling him you don't care for his shirt. Our sexuality is at the core our our bieng. It is not a trifle to tell someone that one of the bases of what makes him human is wrong. \n \n Again, if after you have examined your scriptures and conscience and considered the situation, you decide that homosexuality is wrong for yourself, knock yourself out. You may want to even teach that to your children - but fat lot of good that will do. It is always harmful. It makes gay kids hate themselves and straight kids hate gay kids. Generally speaking. \n \n The outward disapproval of homosexuality is an anachronism. Gay teen suicide is a consequence of that barbarous attitude. It make no sense to do so. What is a gay person supposed to do with the information that homosexuality is wrong?? Please answer this. No good can come from it. \n \n Do not bring up the \"hate the behavior, not the immutable orientation\" baloney. The expectation that someone needs to engage is sexual behavior with those they are repulsed by or not at all is, well, simply stupid. \n \n I know you desperately want to hold on those beliefs. But they make no sense. Many, many christians believe otherwise for the reasons I have outlined. Homosexuality is part of the human condition. It simply is. It harms no one. God thinks it's OK. \n \n An aversion to homosexuality or the espousal that it is wrong is always bigotry. It is bigotry because there is no logical or compassionate reason to do so, it dehumanizes and oppresses a people and it always causes harm.\n \n Sometimes the harm is merely hurt feelings. No big deal. SOmetimes the negativity gets augmented to such a degree that it is devastating enough to want to end ones life. There are many cases in point. Tyler Clementi is just one.",

   "Homosexuality is a disordered behavior. What's more, it's (gay sex relations) an abomination in the eyes of God. Trying to justify illicit sinful behavior as you're attempting to do is not going to fly with us Biblically-based Christians. You might as well give it up.\n\n \n No, its not 'disordered.' It's the way some people are made--they can't help the fact they are attracted to members of the same gender any more than you can help being attracted to people of opposite gender. At least TRY to understand some of the underlying issues here. You can object to things the Bible says object to--that's your religious prerogative. But when you call it a 'disorder' you cross the line into bias and bigotry. Jesus always had compassion even in his opposition to sinful behavior. He may have told the adulteress to go and sin no more, but he still defended her and saved her from being stoned. I've never seen you do anything but go on the attack when it comes to gay people. They are people, just like anyone else.",

   "You really don't want to get this, do you?\n I have not suggested condoning just any behavior, of course. I am not suggestiing stiflling your free speech (gag order); I am saying that speech is harmful.\n\n \n Sure, I don't disagree with that. I'm not sure it changes anything here, but I can agree that speech--some speech anyway, can be harmful. But I don't agree that speech is harmful just because it happens to indicate a moralistic objection to homosexual behavior.\n \n \nYou are trying to euphemize your behavior by calling it \"objecting\" to homosexuality. First, I don't know what that means. It makes about as much sense as objecting to glaciers. Homosexuality is a fact of our human condition. Those that are homosexual cannot change. You are not dispassionately objecting to something trivial, you are condemning something that makes us human beings.\n\n \n Let me be clear here: I am not objecting to homosexuality. I am fully aware that people have sexuality as a state of being. I am very careful to say that my moralistic objection is over actions (as the religious position almost always IS). The terminology matters, and I intentionally do not say \"homosexuality\" when I mention the position I take because it's not the state of being that I referring to. Let's get that out of the way. Objecting to any state of being or state of nature is not on the table here. It's not what I'm talking about nor have I said such that I am aware of. (I think you would find very few people who object to homosexuality in the sense of a state of being, i.e. in the sense of something a person can't change. Every case I can think of where I have heard anyone talk about this in religious circles has been about actions. And FWIW, there is nothing that I know of in Christian scripture that condemns the state of being when it comes to sexuality.)\n \n I'm also not talking about MY position or behavior. You keep trying to dodge the issues by making about the posters you engage with with statements like \"you really don't want to ...\" and \"you are trying to euphamize ...\" The issue is out there as controversy, regardless of anything I am or am not doing. This isn't about me, you, or any one person here or anywhere.\n \n \nTelling a gay person that homosexuality is wrong is not the same as telling him you don't care for his shirt. Our sexuality is at the core our our bieng. It is not a trifle to tell someone that one of the bases of what makes him human is wrong.\n\n \n Again, it's not a state of being that I'm talking about--religious objections are over engaging in actions. Look, there are plenty of religious gay people that believe the same way I do. That's why many intentionally don't engage in homosexual relationships--they want to adhere to their religion. Why should they and other religious people throw their beliefs out the window on that issue just because you think they should?\n \n \nAgain, if after you have examined your scriptures and conscience and considered the situation, you decide that homosexuality is wrong for yourself, knock yourself out.\n\n \n A moralistic position never has to be kept only to oneself. If that were the case, one could say the same about the position you are taking here as well. That's not the culture we live in--you, me, and everyone else engages in arguing their beliefs and positions. It's part of living in a pluralistic society.\n \n \nThe outward disapproval of homosexuality is an anachronism. Gay teen suicide is a consequence of that barbarous attitude. It make no sense to do so.\n\n \n I don't disagree with that. I have no disapproval, outwardly or inwardly, over homosexuality. It's a state of being, and that's not what I'm talking about at all.\n \n \nDo not bring up the \"hate the behavior, not the immutable orientation\" baloney. The expectation that someone needs to engage is sexual behavior with those they are repulsed by or not at all is, well, simply stupid.\n\n \n Too late, pointing out that it's the behavior religion is concerned with was something I got to early in this post. You mentioned that almost in passing, but it's a very central aspect of this. Sorry, but for religion, it really IS about behaviors and actions. Seriously. I know you think it's not, but you're simply wrong if you think otherwise. The admonitions in scripture aren't against \"homosexuality.\" They are against engaging in same-gender sexual actions. I know this will sound silly, but from religion's standpoint it would be just as wrong for two STRAIGHT people to engage in same-gender sexual behavior. So from their standpoint, it's not about the 'nature' issue.\n \n I also think you're not giving human beings much credit here at all--people control their behavior over and above their nature all the time. For example, it may feel completely normal and natural for John Doe to have an affair with the hot lady next door instead of being faithful to his homely wife, but that doesn't mean it's the right thing to do, and many people don't. We aren't automatons and robots--we have the capability to control ourselves. Look, you don't have to agree with me here. I don't expect you to, frankly. But what I get frustrated with is the prejudiced idea that you and your movement takes which takes a judgmental approach toward anyone who argues with you on this. It's hypocritical for you to do so, because you don't want people to judge gays or call them 'immoral' but then you cannot discuss these matters yourself without making value judgments on those you discuss with. You've been doing that this whole discussion. I have no problem with 'agreeing to disagree'--it's your side that refuses to do that.\n \n Religion shouldn't have to change its tenets just because you think objecting -< suicide when it comes to gay-related issues. If you don't want their beliefs, then you don't have to be religious. No one is making you go out and join a socially conservative church.\n \n \nAn aversion to homosexuality or the espousal that it is wrong is always bigotry. It is bigotry because there is no logical or compassionate reason to do so, it dehumanizes and oppresses a people and it always causes harm.\n\n \n That may be, but religion often doesn't object to sexual behaviors due to 'aversion' or bigotry. It does so because that's the tenets of the religion--from it's scriptures. From the standpoint that this is religion taking a position on actions, we might as well be talking about Mormons and coffee-drinking, or Jews and pork-eating.\n \n \nSometimes the harm is merely hurt feelings. No big deal. SOmetimes the negativity gets augmented to such a degree that it is devastating enough to want to end ones life. There are many cases in point. Tyler Clementi is just one.\n\n \n I agree, there shouldn't be negativity. Religious people should make it clear they don't hate people when they take a stand on behavior they see in society they don't agree with. Religion has definitely been guilty of going too far at times.",

If God calls it a perversion and an abomination then I can certainly call it disordered. It's certainly not ordered by God. And God didn't make them that way.\n \n But I will agree with you that it's the behavior - the homosexual sex act - that's condemned in scripture. Homosexuals per se are people and God wants to save everyone.\n \n Personally I think the Holy Spirit can change them if they would submit themselves to Christ and repent of their sins.",

You are more concerned with moralism than morality. Morality certainly can be \"kept to oneself\".\n Second favorite:\n \n Too late, pointing out that it's the behavior religion is concerned with was something I got to early in this post.\n\n Neener. Neener.\n Two points.\n 1. Objection to sexual behavior not sexuality. Preposterous. It condemns gays to a sexless life. I know there are proscriptions against all kinds of behavior - it is bad behavior, not feelings, we object to. But the feelings behind all those bad behaviors are not OK either. This is different from that. Your main method of argument seems to be generalizing to other unrelated ideas - sure, we all know stealing is bad, but is simply not the same. We are talking about human sexual behavior here. You have admitted that that homosexuality per se is OK. \n Another wonderful quote, here:\n \nthere is nothing that I know of in Christian scripture that condemns the state of being when it comes to sexuality\n. Could that be because scripture knows nothing about sexuality - of any kind? That it was written before we understood this stuff. Your attempts at intellectualization are priceless! See below.\n \n The \"sexuality good/behavior bad\" idea is simply an absurd position. It is also a desperate one because you know it really looks bad to object to something in a person you can't change. Some real troglodytes actually say that homosexuality itself is bad. You, at least, realize that is completely untenable, but because you can't let go of this, you have to create another position, as illogical and cruel as it is. You simply cannot have a sexuality and then not be sexual. \n Speaking of \"can't let go of your position\", that brings me to point number 2.\n \n 2. \n I'm also not talking about MY position or behavior. \n\n Your hands are tied in this because this is what your religion insists upon. Bull. This is a position that you have personally chosen to adopt (and all those others out there who make this a \"controversy\"). There are many other christians reading the same scripture who are really smart and really devout and believe otherwise. Therefore this is YOUR interpretation. Do not skirt this. Take responsibility for your active decision to adopt this idea. You don't have to. You choose to. You can change your position on this and still be a perfectly wonderful Christian. Millions of others do.\n It is clear your cherry pick your vices out of the bible. To back that up you have even concocted that moral code/ritual code device to arbitrarily decide gayness is a sin. This is a position that you personally have decided. Don't hide behind your bible. \n So this is \"your religion\" that tells you gay sex is bad? What religion is that specifically? Who tells you that? The bible? No matter what, it is your personal decision to accept what others have fed you or how you have interpreted the scripture. It is not a slam dunk or there would be no disagreement among Christians. There is no other entity out there called \"religion\" that is calling your moralistic shots.\n That is why this is bigotry - it is a personal decision on your part to say that part of human kind is not OK.",

   "Jyoshu, \n \n You simply do not get it. You really need to think before you make a plurality of, excuse me, stupid comments.\n \n I have read your comments stating that there are many actions people do that others object to. What you do not understand is that the action of murder, stealing, lieing etc.. are all actions that are not an intregal part of the person but actions that a person does. When you are \"objecting\" to the actions of homosexuals, expecially the gay youth, what are you actually objecting too? What could they have possibly have done at their tender age to offend you? They are homosexual, you object to that, you are objecting to their personhood, who they are, an immutable fact about them, unchangable. You might as well comdemn them for their eyecolor. I'm sure you can find something in your book of fairytales that says something about eyecolor. Your book can be used to pretty much validate/condemn whatever and whomever you want to hate, I'm sorry, \"object\" to. \n \n Since these gay youth have mostly done nothing offending in their lifetime, except not being heterosexual, how are they suppose to feel? Loved? Understood? They should know right? Get a freeking grip! Your book is interpreted a thousand different ways, homosexuality can only be interpretated one way. It is who the person is. You want to object to that go ahead. You'll get the same reaction as a bunch of racists outside of a black university because they are black. All, you bunch all ready did that. Y'all let that go I see, that was changeable but your groups view of homosexuality is not changeable. emoticon_frazzled\n \n Religion, all religions, have such a grip on people they will put their bible before their own children. The children often explain to there parents that this is who they are, they were born this way, they have prayed to change, they can't and all they wanted in return is for their parents to accept and love them. Oh, but no, to late for the child. Parents already brainwashed. They \"object\". Well, sorry you can't object over something that is immutable, unchangeable just as you can not \"object\" to the color of a persons skin. \n \n Religion is what needs to be discussed here. Because religion is the cause of most every problem facing the gay community and gay youth. The Koran says that salt water and fresh water will not mix. Really? Their was a demostration for a large group of people showing them that is does mix, see! Oh no they say, it says right here. \n \n That is how stupid letting a book be your brain. Try using your own freaking brain. You cannot put redheads up for debate, you can't put blacks up for debate, It has been shown many times if not proven by the many many stories the gay community has shared with the religious community but all you guys do is wanna follow the above example. Don't follow what millions have told the religious community over decades, just comdemn them because \"NO, it says right here\". Ignorance at its best. \n \n You really need to think before you make such ignorant arguments. The gay community need not \"debate\" this issue with your religious community. By now, you all should GET IT. Use your common sense. We tell you it is not a choice. Your group says it is. ok We tell you we were born this way. Oh, no your group says. We tell you we've tried to change since we knew but can not, but thats not enough. Just let your little book keep thinking for you instead of using your brain and we'll just continue to let our gay youth jump off of bridges. \n \n Every single thing you have said in this thread. You need to turn inward, there you'll find your answer to the pandemic.",

   "That is the crux here. You are more concerned with moralism than morality. Morality certainly can be &#8220;kept to oneself&#8221;.\n\n \n meaningless wordplay. Moralism/morality--makes no difference. \n \n Morality CAN be kept to oneself, of course. I didn't say it couldn't--my point is that no one should feel obligated to do so. I'm saying people shouldn't HAVE to keep their views to themselves, and your arguing against that by saying they CAN, as if I said they couldn't! Are you being intentionally disingenuous here? I'm sorry, but your position is no more superior to theirs, no matter how much you think it is. You don't have the moral high ground locked up here, and therefore they are just as entitled to being vocal about their moralistic position as you. You're certainly vocal about what YOU think on these issues, so don't go asserting they should just keep it to themselves just because they happen to believe homosexual actions are inappropriate. \n \n \n1. Objection to sexual behavior not sexuality. Preposterous. It condemns gays to a sexless life. I know there are proscriptions against all kinds of behavior - it is bad behavior, not feelings, we object to. But the feelings behind all those bad behaviors are not OK either.

We are talking about human sexual behavior here. You have admitted that that homosexuality per se is OK.\n\n \n No, plenty of gay people put their religion over their feelings. You guys are arguing from the standpoint that religion should not be the most important thing in a person's life, and while you are entitled to that position, it's not everyone's In fact, it's not every gay person's worldview. You act as though condemnation to \"a sexless life\" is something awful and horrible for someone, but if it's the life God wants for someone and they choose to follow that life that God wants for them, you simply aren't going to get it. You understand being gay, naturally, but you don't understand their RELIGIOUS part of this equation. And because of that, you can't speak for all gays on this topic. I'm saying some don't want to live the way you're prescribing--you're basically asserting no one should utter the socially conservative position on this. Ergo, you're taking the more restrictive view. What's preposterous is your position here. Again, no one's making you be religious. No one is making you do that anymore than making you become Amish and give up electricity the rest of your life. No, you clearly don't understand someone doing that, but at least come to grips with the fact that many do, and not everyone wants to life your way.\n \n \nCould that be because scripture knows nothing about sexuality - of any kind? That it was written before we understood this stuff. Your attempts at intellectualization are priceless! See below.\n\n \n And there you have it--your position indicates you have no comprehension of someone considering scripture as authoritative. And therefore, this is ultimately a RELIGIOUS debate, over what is authoritative. No, you don't want 2000-year old texts to carry any authority whatsoever on this issue. That's your choice, but clearly many, many DO want it to. \n \n So yes, the religious position is over behavior. Again, we aren't automatons that are slaves to their \"orientation\" because we aren't slaves to human nature. And if you can't speak to the experience of deriving strength to do this from religion (God giving them the ability to do so) then you can't speak to experience here.\n \n \nThe &#8220;sexuality good/behavior bad\" idea is simply an absurd position\n\n \n I don't know if the sexuality is good or bad, because I'm not addressing that. It's beside the point as far as the religious position is concerned. \n \n \nIt is also a desperate one because you know it really looks bad to object to something in a person you can't change.\n\n \n In point of fact people change their behavior all the time, even when it comes to sex! Again, we aren't robots. You're quite simply wrong about this.\n \n \nYour hands are tied in this because this is what your religion insists upon. Bull. This is a position that you have personally chosen to adopt (and all those others out there who make this a &#8220;controversy&#8221;). \n\n \n Well sure, I have no disagreement there. I have chose to adopt my position. \n \n \nThere are many other christians reading the same scripture who are really smart and really devout and believe otherwise. Therefore this is YOUR interpretation.\n\n \n Yes, you are right that there are many Christians who don't hold the same interpretation I and many others do regarding homosexual relationships. But I'm not arguing they don't. Rather, you're making a point there something that everyone here i well aware of. If I didn't disagree with that interpretation, I probably wouldn't be having this discussion, so clearly I don't agree with the Christians you're talking about. My opinion is that to try and make the Bible out as not addressing same-gender sex when it says things like that is to ignore the obvious. Believe me, I've looked into the Biblical issues thoroughly, language studies and everything. And my conclusions are that when the Bible forbids things like ' a man laying with a man', it means what you and anyone else would think that statement means. Believe it or not, sometimes the obvious really is what something means. And I don't mean that in a condescending way; it's just my position on this.\n \n \nDo not skirt this. Take responsibility for your active decision to adopt this idea. \n\n \n I've said very clearly that's my take on it. Yes, it's my interpretation; again we probably wouldn't be having this discussion if that weren't the case. So I'm not sure what your point is here. This isn't a matter of 'taking responsibility' for something.\n \n \nSo this is &#8220;your religion&#8221; that tells you gay sex is bad? What religion is that specifically? Who tells you that? The bible? No matter what, it is your personal decision to accept what others have fed you or how you have interpreted the scripture. \n\n \n Yes. And it's peoples' prerogative to come to that conclusion just as I did. I didn't do it because someone \"fed\" it to me; again I weighed a lot of evidence and study on this. At least acknowledge that your position isn't the only one out there. Again, it's not me that has a problem 'agreeing to disagree' on this. It's you.",

   " No I don't. However I do my best to denegrate jerks and holding a Bible in one's hand does not exclude one from being a jerk. I was raised Christian. I have read the Bible cover to cover.

   "I think I finally understand the thread.\n \n The concept of addressing gay teen suicide is wrong because we are focusing on the \"gay\" part. You see, it is never a good idea to try to understand an issue. If we examine gay teen suicide, we are neglecting all teen suicides, or all suicide for that matter, or all mental illness or all illness. \n \n If we look specifically at gay teen suicide, we can only do so by neglecting the rest of teen suicide. And this is just another example of the preferential treatment that gays are always getting in this country. \n \n Looking at a subset of an issue is a bad idea; it is \"hype\" after all. Some folks want to hype gay teen suicide because, well, I don't know - but it's likely due to the gay liberal agenda. \n \n Likewise, we should not ever consider childhood obesity, depression in the elderly or heart disease in women because none of those subsets of the larger issue have any unique characteristics that are worthy of consideration. We really don't want to examine or understand phenomena too well as that may lead to better ideas about solutions. \n \n We also don't want to consider why gay teens might get depressed enough to off themselves. We don't want to think about the consequences of sentiments that suggest that being gay is wrong. Gay teens should not react to these in a negative way. They need to understand this is not rejection but merely \"objection\". They need to understand this as their parents kick them out of the house. This \"objection\" is OK, because it has a religious foundation. Because of the religious underpinnings, it is never a problem to espouse the evils of homosexuality at any time. This cannot cause any harm. This cannot possibly be related to gay teen depression or suicide because the ideas are rooted in Scripture. \n \n One who decries homosexuality must do so because their faith dictates this. They have no choice in the matter. All Christians feel this way. There is no latitude in this. It is not a personal decision to adopt this position, it is a religious one, and any sequelae of anti-gay rhetoric is the fault of the victim. \n \n Lastly, we should not discuss \"gay\" when mentioning gay teen suicide, but \"gay\" is a type of sexual orientation. The concept of sexual orientation was created last year by liberal East Coast intellectual homo activists for purely political reasons. Except when the bible very explicitly describes this construct (I believe it was in the Second Book of Kinsey).\n \n I finally understand. \n You can learn a lot on the Internet.",

   "This is rediculous. Seriously. The unwavering damnation from the usual crows on this board, and the non chalant attitude toward this subject is not only alarming, but heart wrenching. None of you unless you are gay and been brought to that brink of despair could ever comprehend the terror, the hurt, the isolation of thoughts and attempts of suicide. I have. And I can tell you now that it is one thing I cannot bear to see envelop other young people just like it almost consumed me.\n\n \n I'm sorry you've had to deal with such problems. Certainly no one should have to suffer for being gay or for any other reason.\n \n I think what presents a problem is that the gay pride movement doesn't seem to want to give any room for disagreement on this issue, associating even the merest religious disagreement with rejection--the implication is obviously a guilt-by-association 'objection -< causes-suicide'. It's just not helpful to generalize to the point of just lumping all objection in as part of the problem--objection on controversial social issues is just going to be a fact of life. The answer isn't to get rid of all objection. Instead the solution is two-fold: a.) work harder in society toward tolerance of objection, and b.) for those objecting to not let their objection be hateful. Objection isn't a bad thing. Dialog and disagreement really is ok. But I certainly agree that having to endure hate is bad, and you've had to endure things you should not have had to endure.\n \n I too have gone through very dark times when I was a teenager to the extent you're talking about, but for very different reasons. And so that's why when it comes to the issue of suicide, it's very difficult to just approach this only from a standpoint of GAY suicides.",

   "\n The concept of addressing gay teen suicide is wrong because we are focusing on the \"gay\" part. You see, it is never a good idea to try to understand an issue. If we examine gay teen suicide, we are neglecting all teen suicides, or all suicide for that matter, or all mental illness or all illness.\n\n \n And, of course, sarcasm certainly helps the issue too.\n \n Teen suicide is not a gay issue, and to treat it as such takes the focus away from the real relevant goal: helping suicidal teens. Of course you have to tailor your approach to the specific problem that presents itself, but, yes, if you treat illness as a \"gay illness\" or suicides as \"gay suicides\" you take focus away from those who don't fit into your little box. That's wrong to do.\n \n Just look at what happened with AIDs. It was treated as a gay problem, and that put a lot of straight people at risk.\n \n \nWe also don't want to consider why gay teens might get depressed enough to off themselves. We don't want to think about the consequences of sentiments that suggest that being gay is wrong. Gay teens should not react to these in a negative way. They need to understand this is not rejection but merely &#8220;objection&#8221;. They need to understand this as their parents kick them out of the house.

Here you are. Now would it be permitted to specifically address violence and harassment against the GLBT community while not ignoring other types of bullying such as race. We have and do specifically address race. I hope you would find the FBI a reliable unbiased source.\n \n FBI: Hate crime incidents, victim numbers down - Yahoo! News\n \n \nWASHINGTON &#8211; The number of hate crime incidents and victims declined in 2009 compared to the previous year, the FBI reported Monday.\n \n Of more than 6,000 hate crime offenders, over six in 10 were white while nearly two in 10 were black.\n \n Nearly half of the crime incidents in 2009 were motivated by racial bias and nearly one out of five by religious bias or sexual orientation bias.\n \n More than half the reported hate crimes against individual people were assaults, said the FBI. One out of a hundred hate crimes involved murder or rape.\n \n There were 6,604 hate crime incidents reported last year, down from 7,783 in 2008. There were 8,336 reported victims, down from 9,691 in 2008. The victim totals include not only individuals but also businesses, religious buildings and other institutions,\n \n The year-to-year figures in the FBI reports for 2009 and 2008 are not exactly comparable because the number of law enforcement agencies providing data to the bureau on hate crime went up last year to more than 14,000, compared to 13,690 in 2008.\n \n The Anti-Defamation League welcomed a substantial drop in the number of hate crimes in the latest report but expressed disappointment that more than 60 cities with over 100,000 populations each did not participate in the study.\n \n The report said that out of some 4,000 victims of racial bias, seven in 10 were victims because of prejudice against blacks.\n \n Out of nearly 1,600 victims of anti-religious bias, about the same proportion &#8212; seven of 10 &#8212; stemmed from anti-Jewish bias.\n \n In a separate study, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported that homosexuals are far more likely to be victims of violent hate crime than any other minority group.\n \n Timing the release of its study to coincide with the latest FBI report on hate crimes, the nonprofit center said it based its conclusion on 14 years of FBI hate crime data covering 1995-2008. The center said that homosexuals, or those perceived to be gay, are more than twice as likely to be attacked in a violent hate crime as Jews or blacks; more than four times as likely as Muslims; and 14 times as likely as Latinos\n",
