Some soccer players play with injuries that they have sustained for a long time. David Beckham for instance played on a bad ankle during the England vs. Japan game during the 2002 FIFA World Cup. It's not that they are tougher, they just have more a love for the game. Also Soccer has its roots deeper in other countries. Government agencies do not start up leagues, its actually U-16 Leagues. In countries such as England, France, and Italy all of the club teams have academies that recruit at any age. Most of the soccer players have been playing for that league since the age of 12, you just don't see them play. Also, something you don't realize is that you can be any age and play in the World Cup (12 or older i believe not sure on this). If you want proof, the Russian Women's Team had a 16 year-old Striker. Where have you seen that in Football, Baseball, Hockey, etc. etc.? I think the only sports that do that is Tennis and Golf(not sure on the golf)",

It was boring, very boring, not much happens 4 home runs were hit in about 3 hours of play, woo-hoo.\n I respect American Football, I enjoy playing Madden on my brother's playstation, its not as violent or as technical as rugby (the mother of all sports) and so is easier to watch, yet it is more physical than real football and so can be more competitive.\n Football (english) is more like Basketball, it's mostly about skill, and stamina.\n I am finding it hard to to do a \"breif\" account of football, all I will say is that I think rugby is th greatest sport, in terms of pushing human beings to the limit through competition, but Football is better to watch because it is more exiting, games can change so easily, and the skill of some players is mindboggling for what they can do with a ball.",

This means that the sort of people football favours are the lean sprinters, not much room for thugs, thats why its so weird that rooney has made it to the top level.\n \n The US seems to live its own world of sport maybe it would be respected by other countrys more if it joined in with our great game, Japanese have recently been turning from baseball to football and they're producing some fine players. \n There is hope I have heard of a fourteen year old American called Freddy Adu, he has the top clubs in europe chasing after him, appartly he's the next big thing, we will see....",
