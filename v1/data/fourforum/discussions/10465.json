I don't know but the fact that this made news is disturbing.\n \n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,299578,00.html\n \n \n Barack Obama may choose not to wear an American flag pin on his lapel, but many of the presidential contender's political rivals say they wouldn't leave home without one.\n\n \n And it isn't just Fox News (because you know that comment is coming)\n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071004/ap_on_el_pr/obama_no_flag_pin\n \n Here is some \"expert\" saying not wearing the pin is risky: http://www.kcci.com/news/14279975/detail.html\n \n ...this is just beyond ridiculous.",

I mean, it is obvious from your statement hear that you wish we all died. In fact, you probably work with OBL and support eating babies. \n \n ....sorry, I was giving you a standard talk show radio answer....afterall, I'm a \"great American\". :xbanghead",
