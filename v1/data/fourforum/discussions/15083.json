From the link: Out-of-State marriage licenses cannot be used in Massachusetts\n\n \n A marriage license is an administrative form that is processed by the local court. That has nothing at all to do with this.\n \n \nSee Wilkins v. Zelichowski, where the marriage of 16-year-old female was held invalid in New Jersey, regardless of validity in Indiana where it was performed.\n\n \n No, it was not held invalid. She was allowed to have it annulled:\n \n - Google Scholar\n \n \nThe plaintiff's evidence adequately established that she was 16 years of age when she was married and that she did not confirm her marriage after she had reached 18 years of age and the Chancery Division expressly found that an 373*373 annulment would be \"for the best interests of the child\"; nevertheless it declined to grant the relief sought by the plaintiff on the ground that the marriage was valid in Indiana and should therefore, under principles of the conflict of laws, not be nullified by a New Jersey court because of the plaintiff's nonage. In reaching the same result the Appellate Division recognized that the Chancery Division had ample power to nullify the Indiana marriage of the New Jersey domiciliaries (N.J.S. 2A:34-1(e); Scularekes v. Gullett, 106 N.J. Eq. 369, 371 (Ch. 1930); In re Olcott, 141 N.J. Eq. 8, 11 (Ch. 1947)) but expressed the view that comity dictated that it should not take such action unless there was an imperative New Jersey policy (which it did not find) against marriages of 16-year-old females. See 43 N.J. Super. at page 603. Cf. 2 Beale, Conflict of Laws \u00a7 129.1 (1935); Goodrich, Conflict of Laws 417 (3d ed. 1949); Fleming, \"Choice of Law in Nullity Proceedings,\" 23 Austr.

Rev. 1, 12 (1958).\n\n \n They found that she could get an annulment under new jersey law even though she was married in Indiana. \n \n Again, that has nothing to do with this case....in fact, if the facts were as you present them, there would be no need for an annulment in New Jersey because she would not have been legally married there. \n \n \nIn re Mortenson's Estate, marriage of first cousins held invalid in Arizona, though lawfully performed in New Mexico, given Arizona policy reflected in statute declaring such marriages \"prohibited and void\".\n\n \n Closer, but not quite.

HOWEVER, it is impossible to read the full fiath and credit clause and come to the conclusion that a gay marriage in Hawaii would not be required to be recognized in any of the other 50 states.\n \n Frankly Feinstein is an idiot or she would realize the the faith and credit clause is not something congress CAN \"use\". \n \n Baker Vs Nelson has nothing at all to do with the issue of whether the faith and credit clause would require one state to recognize a marriage performed in another. \n \n There is absolutely no possibility that it does not. Otherwise to be legally married in all 50 states you would have to visit each one and get married there. That would be silly...which is why we have the full faith and credit article in the constitution. Otherwise you would not be married to your wife when you left the state that you were originally married in. Child custody would be impossible across state lines. \n \n The only reason they passed the DOMA was that Hawaii was allowing gay marriages and nobody could come up with a legal argument for why other states did not have to recognize those marriages. It was essentially a stopgap measure because there is no possible way that you can actually come up with a legal argument for the DOMA being constitutional. It simply is not. BUT, it gave states time to take their own steps. Currently roughly half the states have their own DOMA versions that proactively ban gay marriage. This actually gives them a defensible position because a public policy exception has always been recognized to the full faith and credit clause...a state that proactively bans something is not bound by the laws in a state where it is legal (unless it is actually a judgment by a court). \n \n Things get tricky when you start trying to explain away rights in the constitution because you dont like how they are exercises, dont they?\n \n Here is any idea.....since it takes an incredible amount of imagination, and an even more incredible amount of BS, to come to the conclusion that bans on gay marriage do not violate both the due process and equal protection, lets stop trying to explain away somebodies rights and just let them exercise them. I will admit...I am a little creeped out at the idea of a couple of gay men getting married, too. I am far beyond creeped out at the idea that we should come up with elaborate, BS, nonsensical arguments and use them to strip others of their rights.",

   "A marriage license is an administrative form that is processed by the local court. That has nothing at all to do with this.\n\n \n And marriage is a contract between a couple and the State.

She was allowed to have it annulled\n \n They found that she could get an annulment under new jersey law even though she was married in Indiana.\n\n \n Come on, look at the reasoning. It was clearly a decision on the applicability of out-of-State laws in regards to marriage. The \"Chancery Division\": declined to grant the relief sought by the plaintiff on the ground that the marriage was valid in Indiana and should therefore, under principles of the conflict of laws, not be nullified by a New Jersey court because of the plaintiff's nonage.\n \n Wilkins reversed this, saying: It is undisputed that if the marriage between the plaintiff and the defendant had taken place here, the public policy of New Jersey would be applicable and the plaintiff would be entitled to the annulment; and it seems clear to us that if New Jersey's public policy is to remain at all meaningful it must be considered equally applicable though their marriage took place in Indiana. While that State was interested in the formal ceremonial requirements of the marriage it had no interest whatever in the marital status of the parties. Indeed, New Jersey was the only State having any interest in that status, for both parties were domiciled in New Jersey before and after the marriage and their matrimonial domicile was established here. The purpose in having the ceremony take place in Indiana was to evade New Jersey's marriage policy and we see no just or compelling reason for permitting it to succeed.\n \n The annulment was granted because Indiana's laws did not obtain in regards to the validity of their marriage where it conflicted with New Jersey's own public policy. If Indiana's laws regarding the validity of the marriage were in effect the annulment wouldn't be granted. This is directly applicable to what we're talking about.\n \n \nCloser, but not quite. The court found that the marriage was void unless it was \"recognized in the place where solemnized\". Still not really the same (though the court was pretty much just fudging here).\n\n \n The statute was interpreted to mean all marriage laws and not just those related to solemnization in Medlin v Medlin and declares that they must look at Arizona law to determine the validy of the marriage instead of the State in which the marriage took place.\n \n \nI certainly agree that congress should not be dabbling in gay marriage.

   "And marriage is a contract between a couple and the State. If the State refuses to honor the administrative form attesting to your status then that seems important.\n\n \n No, it is not. It is a contract between 2 people that the state recognizes. \n \n This was not even that. A marriage license is a permit to get married, it conveys no status whatsoever. In this case it was found that a marriage licenses issued in another state only gave you the right to have a marriage carried out in that state, much like purchasing a hunting license in Alaska does not give you the right to hunt in Deleware. \n \n \n\n \n Come on, look at the reasoning.

If Indiana's laws regarding the validity of the marriage were in effect the annulment wouldn't be granted. This is directly applicable to what we're talking about.\n\n \n WRONG. The marriage was annulled because in new jersey a woman who is married before the age of 18 can get an annulment if she has not \"confirmed\" the marriage after turning 18. From your link:\n \n \nOn January 4, 1956 the plaintiff filed her annulment complaint under N.J.S. 2 A:34-1(w)hich provides that a judgment of nullity may be rendered on the wife's application upon a showing that she was under the age of 18 years at the time of her marriage and that the marriage has not been \"confirmed by her after arriving at such age\"; the statute also provides that where a child has been born there shall be no judgment of nullity unless the court is of the opinion that the judgment \"will not be against the best interests of the child.\" Although the defendant was duly served he did not file any answer and he chose not to contest the plaintiff's proceeding. \n\n \n There was never any question raised about whether or not the marriage was valid, or whether or not the state of New Jersey recognized the marriage. If either of those 2 things had been true, there would be no need for an annulment since you cannot have an annulment unless you have a valid marriage to begin with. The ONLY question was whether or not New Jerseys law allowing an individual who was married before they were 18 to get an annulment applied to a marriage in another state.\n \n It has absolutely nothing at all to do with this thread. \n \n \n\n The statute was interpreted to mean all marriage laws and not just those related to solemnization in Medlin v Medlin and declares that they must look at Arizona law to determine the validy of the marriage instead of the State in which the marriage took place.\n\n \n Close, but not exactly. Mr Medlin argued that he was not actually married because his stepfather, not his custodial guardian, gave him permission for the marriage. \n \n MARICOPA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT\n \n \n 4. Medlin v. Medlin, 194 Ariz. 306, 981 P.2d 1087 (CA 1, 6/17/1999) - Husband acting pro se filed for divorce. After trial, Wife was awarded spousal maintenance and attorney's fees. Husband then retained counsel and filed a motion to amend the petition to request annulment on the ground that the marriage was void since Husband married at age 16 with the consent of his stepfather only, contrary to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 25-102 and 122, which required parental consent. Wife countered that the parties were married in Nevada where stepparent consent was sufficient, and that A.R.S. \u00a7 25-112(B) provides that marriages valid in the state where they occur will be recognized as valid in Arizona unless void under A.R.S. \u00a7 25-101. The trial court agreed with Wife. The Court of Appeals affirmed on other grounds, finding that the marriage was not valid under A.R.S. \u00a7 25-112(B) since the parties had married in Nevada to evade the laws of Arizona, relying on A.R.S. \u00a7 25-112(C). Instead, the Court of Appeals decided that the marriage was merely voidable, not void under A.R.S. \u00a7 25-101, and that Husband had ratified the marriage by remaining with Wife for about seven years after he turned 18.\n \n\n \n \n \n \nAs you yourself have stated, out-of-State statutes or acts that are contrary to the forum State's policy need not be followed under Full Faith and Credit. To do otherwise, as stated in Alaska Packers XXX'n v Industrial Accident Comm'n: \"would lead to the absurd result that, wherever the conflict arises, the statute of each State must be enforced in the courts of the other, but cannot be in its own\"\n \n So it is perfectly reasonable to read that Clause and continue to conclude it does not require every State to recognize marriages from out-of-State.

It was argued on those grounds that restrictions on homosexual marriage were unconstitutional and the case was dismissed \"for want of a substantial Federal question\". What that seems to mean is that the issue is meant to be decided on the State level.\n\n \n We are not talking about homosexual marriage as a whole here....we are talking about the DOMA, which related only to the full faith and credit clause, which is a constitutional matter so a federal matter. \n \n As far as Baker V Nelson goes, pin your hopes on one line opinions at your own peril. 2 federal courts have already found ways around it, apparently without putting forth much effort. Frankly re Kandu, U.S. Bankruptcy Court shows how laughably pathetic the courts \"position\" was in Baker. Even if you discount the idea that Lawrence v.

The marriage was annulled because in new jersey a woman who is married before the age of 18 can get an annulment if she has not \"confirmed\" the marriage after turning 18.\n\n \n And that request for annulment was denied because: the marriage was valid in Indiana and should therefore, under principles of the conflict of laws, not be nullified by a New Jersey court because of the plaintiff's nonage.\n \n That is exactly the reasoning given, so of course the validity of the marriage was part of the question. This isn't some crazy interpretation of mine, the case as much as says that if full faith and credit is given to the Indiana laws then the marriage won't be annulled. Wilkins, overturning this, specifically says that the couple would be circumventing the laws of New Jersey if the marriage isn't annulled (that is, if the marriage was considered valid as it is in Indiana).\n \n \nIf either of those 2 things had been true, there would be no need for an annulment since you cannot have an annulment unless you have a valid marriage to begin with. The ONLY question was whether or not New Jerseys law allowing an individual who was married before they were 18 to get an annulment applied to a marriage in another state.\n\n \n Hm. From here:\n \n A marriage annulment is a legal procedure that dissolves a couple's marital status by establishing that a valid marriage never existed.\n \n From here\n \n Unlike divorce, it is usually retroactive, meaning that an annulled marriage is considered to be invalid from the beginning almost as if it had never taken place\n \n From here\n \n Annulment is the process by which a Court states that a marriage never legally existed.\n \n Annulment seems required even in cases where you were forced under threat to get married, which would obviously render the marriage invalid from the beginning. Unless they're using the word in an unfamiliar way, you can only get an annulment if your marriage is not a valid marriage. If this is true, then the question is whether the laws of a State in which a marriage took place have applicability in a State where the same marriage is not valid.\n \n \nClose, but not exactly. Mr Medlin argued that he was not actually married because his stepfather, not his custodial guardian, gave him permission for the marriage.\n\n \n And the request for annulment was denied, yes. The gist of the case itself isn't directly applicable, but the clarification to In re Mortenson&#8217;s Estate is.\n \n From Medlin v Medlin:\n \n The statute specifically states that the parties cannot evade the laws of the state relating to marriage. We interpet that to mean all marriage laws and not just those relating to the act of solemnization. See In re Mortenson's Estate, (first cousins could not evade the laws of Arizona by marrying in another state). By marrying in Nevada without proper consent, the parties evaded the laws of Arizona. Therefore, we must look to the law of Arizona to determine the validity of the marriage.\n \n The laws relating to minors doesn't declare the marriage nullified, but the laws relating to relatives does. The marriage to the first cousins was thus invalid in In re Mortenson's Estate.\n \n \nYou are misrepresenting my position here. As I said in my last post, I stated that the public policy exception would allow a state to fail to recognize a marriage if there is an affirmative prohibition in place.\n\n \n It is not my intention to misrepresent your position. However, a literal interpretation of the Full Faith and Credit clause allows no exception, and would lead to an absurd result. My entire point has been that States do not need to recognize marriages that violate their own public policy. The argument I've seen is that the Full Faith and Credit clause requires all States to recognize marriages from out-of-State, period, and that is obviously incorrect (since there is the public policy exception), even if that Clause is the controlling feature in out-of-State marriage. \n \n \nAs far as Baker V Nelson goes, pin your hopes on one line opinions at your own peril. 2 federal courts have already found ways around it, apparently without putting forth much effort. Frankly re Kandu, U.S. Bankruptcy Court shows how laughably pathetic the courts \"position\" was in Baker. Even if you discount the idea that Lawrence v.

Baker exists and has an effect. Talking about those effects doesn't represent any hope on my part, besides the hope that States retain some power in this. I don't see what is ludicrous, since the Federal gov't can have provisions relating to marriage without defining marriage. DOMA shouldn't be treading in an area that is the province of the States. Getting government out of marriage entirely isn't a solution since it seems people like and support recognition of the cultural custom of marriage.",
