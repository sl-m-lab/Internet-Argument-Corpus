   "Why Whites Think Blacks Have No Problems\n \n By Tim Wise\n \n Just a few years ago, a public opinion poll indicated that only 6 percent of whites in the U.S. believed racism was still a \"very serious\" problem facing African Americans. While larger percentages believed racism to be somewhat of a problem, only this anemic share of the white community saw it as an issue of great importance.\n \n When you consider that twice that number ? or as many as 12 percent ? have told pollsters they believe Elvis Presley is still alive, it becomes apparent that delusion has taken on a whole new meaning among the dominant racial majority. Apparently, it is easier for whites to believe that a pill-popping, washed-up lounge singer faked his own death and is playing midnight gigs at some tropical resort, than to believe what black folks say they experience every day.\n \n It makes me think that if ignorance is indeed bliss, then my fellow whites must be among the happiest folks on the planet.\n \n So it was no surprise to read that once again a poll has been released, indicating that whites by and large don't think racial discrimination remains a big problem, and that whites and blacks continue to view issues of racial equality far differently.\n \n According to the recent Gallup Survey on \"Black-White Relations,\" seven out of ten whites believe that blacks are treated equally in their communities: an optimism with which only 40 percent of blacks agree. Eight in ten whites say blacks receive equal educational opportunities, and 83 percent say blacks receive equal housing opportunities in their communities. Only a third of whites believe blacks face racial bias from police in their areas.\n \n Despite the fact that half of all blacks say they have experienced discrimination in the past 30 days, whites persist in believing that we know their realities better than they do, and that black complaints of racism are the rantings of oversensitive racial hypochondriacs. Blacks, we seem to believe, make mountains out of molehills, for Lord knows we would never make a molehill out of a mountain!\n \n That white perceptions of the extent of racial bias are rooted in a stupendous miasma of ignorance is made clear by a number of salient facts. First, as will be shown below, there is the statistical evidence indicating that equal opportunity is the stuff of fiction, not documentary; and secondly, the simple truth that white perceptions of racism's salience have always been splendidly naive. Indeed, as far back as 1963, before there was a Civil Rights Act to outlaw even the most blatant racial discrimination, 60 percent of whites said that blacks were treated equally in their communities. In 1962, only 8 years after the Brown decision outlawed segregation in the nation's schools (but well before schools had actually moved to integrate their classrooms), a stunning 84 percent of whites were convinced that blacks had equal educational opportunity. In other words, white denial of the racism problem is nothing new: it was firmly entrenched even when this nation operated under a formal system of apartheid.\n \n Of course, this ignorance of the lived realities of black people is no surprise. Rather it is in large part the result of our isolation from African Americans in daily life.\n \n More than 80 percent of whites live in virtually all-white neighborhoods, and nearly nine in ten white suburbanites live in communities with less than 1 percent black populations. What's more, only 12 percent of whites in law school today ? who by historical standards have had more opportunity to mix with people of color than any generation before them ? say they had significant interaction with blacks while growing up.\n \n One can only expect this degree of isolation to lead to a skewed perception of what other people experience. After all, if one doesn't know many blacks, or personally witness discrimination, it is all the more likely that one will find the notion of widespread mistreatment hard to digest. Especially when one has been socialized to give more credence to what members of one's own group say, than what the racial \"other\" tells us is true.\n \n Of course, I'm not suggesting that every time a black person says they have been discriminated against that they are, in fact, correct. Individuals, after all, can misperceive certain situations. But the reality of individual misperception should not lead to the widespread white belief in mass black delusion, which is virtually the only way one can read the Gallup figures.\n \n For so many whites to believe that blacks have equal opportunity, is not only to discount a few claims of discrimination that may be without merit: rather, it is to reject the broad swath of claims that virtually every African American can bring forth from their personal mental rolodex. Fact is, if even one-tenth of the black claims of discrimination were accurate, this would translate into well over 1.75 million instances of anti-black racial bias every single month, based on survey data. Unfortunately, it is doubtful the numbers are this small.\n \n Though the Gallup survey didn't address racial discrimination in the labor market, there is little question that when whites say blacks are treated equally, they are also assuming this to be true for the world of work. But what is the reality? According to a recent study by the Russell Sage Foundation, even though blacks search for work longer and often more aggressively than whites, they are between 36-44 percent less likely to be hired for jobs in mostly white suburbs, even when their experience and qualifications are equal to their white counterparts. White males with a high school diploma are just as likely to have a job, and tend to earn just as much as black males with college degrees, and on average, even when age, experience, education and other relevant factors are considered, blacks average at least 10 percent less pay than similar whites.\n \n As for education, the picture is much the same. Although formal segregation is illegal, de facto segregation remains a reality thanks to \"ability tracking,\" which has less to do with actual ability, and more to do with racial and class bias against children of color and those from low-income families. Beginning as early as kindergarten, teachers and counselors separate students based on so-called cognitive skill levels, despite evidence that the tests used to determine these skill levels are inaccurate predictors of ability and terribly biased against students from non-dominant cultural backgrounds.\n \n Even when black students show potential that is equal to or above that of whites, they are 40 percent less likely to be placed in advanced or accelerated classes, according to the head of the College Board. Despite evidence of ability, blacks are 2.5 times more likely to be placed in remedial or low-track classes, where they will typically be taught by the least qualified teachers, be given less challenging material to learn, and receive on average nearly 40 hours less actual instruction annually.\n \n So too is educational inequity fostered by unequal discipline, meted out in a racially disparate manner. Even though black and white rates of school rule infractions are roughly equal, black students are twice as likely as whites to be suspended or expelled. Blacks are half of all students suspended or expelled for weapons violations, even though self-report surveys indicate whites are just as likely to bring weapons to school, and white males are actually twice as likely as black males to do so. Since blacks are more likely to be suspected ? thanks to common stereotypes about violence and delinquency ? they are the ones who get searched and caught, but this hardly means they break the rules more often.\n \n According to studies by the Applied Research Center, the disproportionate rate of black suspensions is the result of greater punishment given for subjective infractions like \"defying authority,\" or \"attitude problems,\" both of which are perceived as more threatening when coming from black students than whites.\n \n As for housing, white confidence in equal opportunity makes for nice wishful thinking, but hardly comports with reality. Virtually every study on housing bias in rental and mortgage markets for the past three decades has found evidence of substantial ongoing discrimination. According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, there may be as many as 2 million instances of racial housing bias each year, and as many as half of all blacks may face discrimination when trying to rent an apartment or purchase a home.\n \n According to the Boston Federal Reserve Bank, blacks are 56 percent more likely than whites to be rejected for a mortgage loan, even after controlling for 38 factors that could explain higher rejection rates for blacks ? including issues of credit history, collateral, and income. Nationwide, mortgage loan rejection rates for the highest income group of blacks is roughly the same as the rejection rates for the lowest income whites.\n \n Finally, white protestations that blacks receive equal treatment from police in their communities, is nothing short of laughable. A look at police prosecution of the war on drugs alone gives the lie to white claims of equal law enforcement. Though blacks are only 14 percent of illegal drug users, they are 35 percent of those arrested for possession. In many communities, including some of the ones where whites claim there is no bias in policing, blacks face arrest rates for drugs that are five, ten, even twenty times higher than the rates for whites, despite roughly equal rates of drug usage.\n \n Though a slim majority of whites admit that racial profiling ? one clear example of unequal treatment ? does happen, apparently few believe it happens where they live. Yet in state after state, studies have found a disproportionate rate of highway and surface street stops of vehicles driven by blacks, and searches of cars driven by blacks, above and beyond the rates of black traffic infractions, which otherwise might create reasonable cause.\n \n In New York City, from 1997-1998, the NYPD's Street Crimes Unit stopped and frisked 135,000 people: 85 percent of whom were people of color. Only 4500 persons were ultimately arrested and prosecuted, meaning that over 95 percent of those harassed were innocent. Interestingly, whites who were stopped were significantly more likely to be found with drugs or other contraband, indicating that not only was this policy of racial stops and searches a biased one, but it failed the test as valid crime control on its own merits as well.\n \n Of course, I hardly expect the facts to matter much, as an awful lot of white folks seem impervious to them. When it comes to racial realities, the levels of ignorance are so ingrained as to be almost laughable. Perhaps that's why 12 percent of whites actually say blacks are a majority of the nation's population, and why most whites believe blacks are a third of the nation's population, instead of the thirteen percent they actually represent. We seem to see black people everywhere, and apparently we see them doing quite well.\n \n Apparently, we even see them as our buddies. 75 percent of whites in one recent poll indicated that they had multiple close black friends. Sounds great, until you realize that 75 percent of white Americans represents about 145 million people. 145 million who say they have multiple black friends, despite the fact that there are only 35 million black people to go around.\n \n Which means one of two things: either whites are clueless about black people, friendships, or both; or black folks are mighty damned busy, running from white house to white house to white house, being our friends. In which case, we can put away all that nonsense about blacks \"taking our jobs.\" After all, how could blacks have time to work at all, what with all the backyard barbecues they're attending at the houses of their white pals? Hell, maybe Elvis will even invite them all to Graceland when he makes his triumphant return to Memphis.",

   "I've only got time for a quick answer to the original post to this thread, but I'll respond to it with data I am familiar with off the top of my head. I'm confident that almost all blacks think the criminal justice system is systematically biased. In a chapter in Michael Tonry's 1998 book Handbook of Crime and Punishment, Robert J. Sampson, arguably the world's leading criminologist and a liberal, summarizes the best emprical studies on the topic, and concludes that overall there just isn't systemtic bias. Once you have controlled for relevant legal factors, race ends up being inconsequential. You may at certain times and places find discrimination, but you also in certain times in places see leniency and paternalism shown toward minority suspects. The only area where there appears to be bias is in the case of an incidence of violence toward a white victim. In that case, an offender is likely to get a more harsh punishment than when the victim is black.\n \n So the hard data have refuted the feelings of most blacks. It doesn't surprise me in the least that blacks are likely to feel that discrimination is all around them. Surveys show that around 40% of blacks believe or think it is possible that whites developed the HIV virus deliberately to kill off blacks. It is not surprising given that a black child from the crib is told that there is a demonic white racist under every rock. But as the author writes, if many blacks feel it, it must be true, so I'm sure we'll see another thread popping up soon arguing that whites owe blacks reparations for deliberately infecting them with AIDS. Many believe it; it must be true.",

Sampson, arguably the world's leading criminologist and a liberal, summarizes the best emprical studies on the topic, and concludes that overall there just isn't systemtic bias.\n\n Sorry, but your one \"expert\"'s opinion does not trump volumes of study. Unless you can cite the studies he summarizes, your comment is useless as an assertion. \n \n If there is a problem with a given study mentioned, let me know, I'll just take it off the list. Aside from that, I stand by what the data shows- prevalent prejudice and discrimination. Not only in the realm of criminology, but in access to finances, jobs, housing, etc. Not to mention hailing a cab.\n \n \nIt doesn't surprise me in the least that blacks are likely to feel that discrimination is all around them.\n\n Me neither, because it is.\n \n My favorite study in the article is one where they evaluate white people's claims to having \"multiple close friends\" who are black. That one's funny, because lots of racist white people say that as though it excuses their behaviour. I always wondered who those ephemereal \"friends\" were, and whether they really existed.

   "Sorry, but the anecdotal evaluation of someone who doesn't experience racism on the prevalence of racism is about as useful as a McDonald's customer evaluating working conditions based on what they see while they order their McDeal.\n \n\n Now folks, you tell me who is the better judge of white racism: a white guy who other whites feel very comfortable with so they can speak frankly and candidly about their race-related attitudes, or the typical black person who has been indoctrinated from the crib that the \"man\" is out to get you which then gets backed up on a daily basis by black activists and media indoctrination. This mind-set is clearly evidenced by the 40% of blacks who think or suspect that whites invented HIV to deliberately kill blacks off. (Notice that Mizmaxx has not denied this claim; what do you bet we see a new thread making the case for it). \n \n Racism is a very elusive reality, and it requires a lot of interpretation on the part of the victim. In my 10 years of teaching, most of the students who contest my multiple-choice type tests based on the books and lectures are black students, and when I tell them I can't change your grade, you answered X number of questions wrong, sometimes they will send a vibe out or act in a way where I think they are thinking I am discriminating against them. Now who knows my motivation better in that situation, them or me?\n \n \n\n If you expect to argue based on an exerpt of this book which quotes studies that you won't name, yes. A published study I can usually find just by Googling. You don't expect ppl to buy Tonry's book in order to find the cited studies when you can just give the information yourself. If you don't have the book and are quoting from memory, are we just expected to believe your word that Sampson's review was convincing?\n \n\n No doubt the specific references are better than citing his review study. If I find time I'll check it out of the library and list the studies, but I had hoped that discussants would trust me in not inventing that a leading criminologist concluded this from his review of the research. \n \n \n\n As a slight aside, I find it interesting that you should be using a criminology text by Tonry to back up your point, and in fact that is what makes your claim about Sampson most suspicious. \n \n\n You've got me; I'm a liar who just makes things up. One shouldn't be surprised in the least at this apparent contradiction. Research in almost every area is totally dominated by liberals, and they have a nasty habit of repeating sacred articles of faith along with fishing for satisifying facts. Robert Sampson is one of the few criminologists who follows the data instead of doctrine; sometimes his findings help liberals, sometimes they do not. Here his reading of the data does not help the liberal case. But liberals are true believers, so they just ignore the research when it's inconvenient. The only reason I'm sure why Sampson was able to publish his piece was because of his prestige; Tonry would have told anyone else with those conclusions to go pound salt because he is a propagandist, not a scientist. What I've read of Tonry is heavy on theory and bivariate correlation with no multivariate data analysis. Such an approach is more appropriate in presenting a theory rather than testing a theory. \n \n \n\n I know Tonry from the book Malign Neglect, which is described thus- Michael Tonry takes an in-depth look into the racism that permeates every level of the criminal justice and law enforcement institutions in this country. Tonrys book covers racial profiling, racially targeted crime policy, the unnecessary War on Drugs, punishment, sentencing policy, and the like. Reading Malign Neglect can lead to the basest of conclusions: that \"The Burden on Black Americans\" is vast and deeply entrenched.\n \n\n The most carefully done research simply fails to back up the contention that the sysem is rife with racism. I assumed it was when I first started learning, but I respect data and changed my mind. Forty years of research attempting to prove that the system is filled with rabid racists and institutional racism--everybody went in looking to find it--has produced very little to back it up. \n \n Another example would be the liberal textbook I use on criminological theory by Ronald Akers, another leading criminologist. He concludes that legal factors explain the disproportionate numbers of blacks in the system. Extralegal factors like race, social class, and gender are not important. \n \n \n\n In any and all references to Sampson I have seen demonstrate his commitment to a theory of social breakdown as the cause of any \"Black crime\". He thus posits that consistant Black male unemployment causes them to turn to the illegal economy. Therefore it is not \"laziness\" or inherent \"criminality\" but racism in employment opportunities which causes \"urban crime\".\n\n Oh so you like Sampson now? His research shows a lot of reasons for crime, one being low self-control produced by neglectful, permissive, erratic parenting. Part of his research focus on unemployment, but where does he conclude from the data that the cause of unemployment is racism? He is part of the control school who believes that an important cause of unemployment or a poor work record is low self-control produced by bad parenting.",

Founded in 1900, the association is composed of more than 4,500 schools, colleges, universities, and other educational organizations.

He was convinced enough by his review to conclude that disproportionate numbers of black in the criminal justice system cannot be explained by systematic bias. As for the impressiveness of sources, ask a local college criminologist if Sampson is impressive. You admit yourself that you learned about his research in an introductory course that wasn't even a criminology course. If someone were to ask me to name the 4 world's leading criminological researchers, I would respond Sampson, Hagan, Blumstein, and Nagin or Farrington--3 are on my list. I would have said Hindelang too, who is on my list, but the poor guy died young.\n \n By the way, I didn't choose this article because it confirmed my biases--the kind of approach you clearly use. This article CHANGED my view. I had read some of the studies he cited, but was skeptical about no systematic bias until he put it all together. Let me ask you a question: please inform us what kind of evidence would convince YOU that there was no systematic bias?",

   "I believe that all surveys/studies can be swayed in any direction you choose by the the people you survey or study. For example, I am going to determine if chicken tastes good. I can go down to the local Popeyes and survey/study 20 people. 19 out of those 20 think chicken taste good thats why they are at Popeyes in the first place. The one person that disagreed ordered the shrimp sandwich and was only there because he came with a chicken lover. \n If I want to prove the otherside of the equation I go survey the cattle barons, that have a vested interest in selling beef. They all say chicken tastes terrible, you can easily spread disease by purchasing and consuming poultry. What ever you do don't buy chicken, instead buy beef. \n \n Agreed this is a very trivial senerio. However, you can insert any senerio into that equation you like. Survey/ studies are easily manipulated by the people surveyed or the people doing the survey.\n Yes I agree studies are swade in ether direction. Most of them as far as I am concerned are rigged.",
