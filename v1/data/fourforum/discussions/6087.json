I think that there are plenty of candidates out there who don't get the publicity or exposure that could carry thier message to the people, therefore they are never given a serious shot at becoming president. Our media and the demopublicans make sure that the 2 party system is the only game in town. We don't have the luxery in this country of picking a president based on who we think will do the most good, we are forced to pick our president on who we think will screw the country up the least. I think the other large problem is that too many americans are afraid to step out of line and vote for a 3rd party candidate. I heard it over and over the last election, when people were asked about the 3rd party candidates, they would simply state that since they did not have a reasonable chance to win, they did not want to waste their vote on them.",
