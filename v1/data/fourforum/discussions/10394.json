   "Yesterday, I saw \"Lucy\", AL 288-1, at the Museum of Natural History in Houston. Houston is the first stop on her planned 5 yr. walkabout in the U.S. After leaving Houston at the end of April of 2008, she will also visit Washington, New York, Denver and Chicago.\n \n Before I got to \"Lucy\", I passed through an exhibit of many wondrous and beautiful artifacts from Ethiopia from centuries past. I appreciated the various short films throughout the exhibit. While the typical view of Ethiopia has been that of a country of starvation and war, that has not always been the case, and it is no longer true. And while Hadar appears desolate, much of the country is beautiful. But still I was in a hurry to see Lucy.\n \n At one point there is a display case with 5 really good replicas of hominid fossils, three of which I recognized as OH-5, KNM-ER 3733, and KNM-ER 1813. The others were familiar but I can't remember which they were. I intend to pay my respects to Lucy again with a pen and paper and take notes. I was just so excited on this first visit that I didn't think to take notes.\n \n Finally, at the end of the exhibition came Lucy. At the far end of the penultimate room was a sign with an arrow - \"<- Lucy\". Starting at the left of the door was a large, semi-circular panoramic depiction of hominid species that extended through almost 180 degrees, with discussion and explanation below. Just to the left of the center of the room was a life size replica of what Lucy may have looked like (reconstructed from the fossils of more than 300 individuals that have been recovered). To the right of center was a display of reproductions of the fossil boned suspended in their relative positions. You can see that exhibit on Wikipedia.\n \n In the center of the room was Lucy. She in what appeared to be a massive wooden case with glass (I suspect it isn't the glass you have in your home windows) on 5 sides. She was reclining on a bed of green felt. I spent a lot of time looking at her.\n \n On point of particular interest was the distal ends of the ulnas. I'm not an anatomist, but I did make an effort use the Internet to observe the wrist structure of humans before my visit. The distal ends of the ulna are not the same. I couldn't find any examples in chimps, but as I understand it, that peculiar protrusion that Lucy has would have prevented her from flexing her wrist backwards. In chimps and gorillas (as I understand it), a similar protrusion locks the wrist to enable knuckle walking.\n \n For the creationists aboard, let me explain. Pretend that you are a football (American) lineman. Get down in a stance and put your knuckles on the ground. Now relax and let the heel of your hand touch the ground. A chimpanzee can't do that - and neither could Lucy.\n \n After I look further into the matter and find the best pictures I can find of the distal end of the ulna of a human and a chimp, are less than adequate. I'm going to go back to visit Lucy. My problem is a good picture of a the distal end of a chimp ulna.\n \n I spent some time observing Lucy and explaining various anatomical characteristics to others who were there.\n \n When I go back, I'm going to be armed with pictures and a magnifying glass.\n \n Visiting Lucy was an amazing experience! In my more than 40 years as a biologist and the 30 or so years since Lucy was discovered, I never hoped to be able to actually see such a specimen.",

The very fossils that Donald Johanson and Tom Gray discovered are on display.\n \nSo tell me, just out of curiosity, how do they know how much hair to put on her life size image?\nAre you trying to be funny? Only a fool would think that anyone is claiming that the model is an exact representation.\n \nI notice she isn't that furry at all.\nActually, she is represented as quite hairy, only a little less so than a chimp. But of course, that is just speculation, given her closeness to the separation of the chimp lineage from that of humans (at about 5 - 6 million years). She actually lived closer in time to the common ancestor with a chimp that she did to modern humans. But, of course, it would be silly to represent her without hair. Most other features of the body can be pretty much determined by the skeleton - length of bones, muscle attachment points, etc.\n [quote]How'd they figure that out from just a few bones?[quote]You're trying to be funny again, aren't you. As you know, only an idiot would think that anyone is claiming that the hairiness is determined from the bones.\n \nLet's see, what do they call people like you at the carnival booths? Oh that's right, an easy mark. Have you read any other good fairy tales lately pandion, besides lucy that is.\nActually, I have heard some good fairy tales. There are some really unbelievable ones in an old book of the mythology of some bronze age, nomadic herdsmen. Like how a few magic beings poofed everything into existance from nothing in six day - and that before there were days. Or the other one about another magical being who made a garden and then made a man, and then a whole bunch of animals to be his companion, encouraging bestiality I guess, until this magical being finally made a woman from a rib. And then there is the combined stories of a guy and his family who built a big boat and then loaded millions and millions of animals aboard, and how they survived, for a year while the whole earth flooded, with only 8 people to care for them. It only takes a little intelligence to look at the earth and realize how ridiculous that is.\n \n Anyone who is ignorant enough to believe that such obvious mythology is historical is a bigger mark than I could ever be. And such people actually give money to those who are duping them with these stories.\n \n Besides, exactly what is it that you think that I \"believe\" that makes me a mark. Certainly, I don't believe in any of the nonsense that you represented.\n \nAt least that would be more realistic.\nNo, it wouldn't. Dinosaurs disappeared about 65 million years ago and Lucy lived about 3.2 million years ago. Saying that Lucy rode a dinosaur is no more realistic than saying that the whole earth was flooded. To believe that, based on such obvious, primitive mythology, would really make one a mark.",

Now squirm children, squirm as you try to defend your false religion.\n\n \n Okay, there is a lot there. Ill tell you what i know as student geologist. \n \n Its not dinosaurs that make oil, mainly plants, and generally a lot older in age - carboniferous in the north sea, Permian in Texas. We do have occasional mass graves of fossils, called lagerstatten, of various ages, the jehol fauna in china having a lot of dinosaurs in it, with exceptional preservation if tissue, including feathers. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daohugou_Beds). In terms of the age of the earth, dinosaurs are not all that old. Most oil sources are devonian to carboniferous ages, when the earth was damp, hot and full of swamps. Lots of plant matter in deltas and and in shallow marine settings which allowed for preservation of their carbon, to be buried and contained within sediments for millions of years. Not dinosaurs turning into oil. \n \n We find dinos at ground level in some places because thats is the only place we can do excavations ( although fossils have been found down mines) - Different levels of sedimentation in different regimes combined with the effects of differential erosion and uplift will result in varying levels of dinosaur bearing strata across the planet. Were were you going with this?\n \n \n I cant answer the dna question but i guess its a simple answer, like burial temperatures destroying dna.\n \n But, the whole point is, if the opinion of that all American institution of Exxon is not good enough for you, what is your take on the generation of oil? I have explained what i know to you, your turn to explain to me. I would be interested in hearing it.",

Would you please write back and send some info that confirms that it does. Thank you, Ronald Turner\n \n The Professor Answers:\n I have a question for your friends, \"Where do they think fuels come from?\"\n Fossil fuels (oil, natural gas and coal - that's why they're called fossil fuels) were formed from vegetation and yes, dinosaurs, deposited during the Carboniferous through the Permian eras which extended 380 to 245 million years ago. As the plants and animal life died, they were buried under mud which gradually hardened into rock. The rotting plants and decayed animal were squashed between heavy layers of the rock and heated by the earth. Over millions of years they changed into coal, oil and natural gas deposits.\n Although this process continues on a smaller scale right now, we are using these fuels at several million times faster than they are being formed. Actually, if you want to be technically correct, all fuels come from the Sun since without its light and heat, nothing would grow. Hope this helps. Thanks for asking. \n \n And you know what is scary kronus? Now that your reading it from a pro-evolutionist source you're thinking, hmm, that makes perfect sense. :xbanghead",

Got any support for that claim?

I await a response.\n\n \n No, no, I am not saying that all fossil fuels are from sea animals and sea vegetation, though some would be. Land vegetation is a very large source of fossil fuels. There would be far more land vegetation than dinosaur in fossil fuels. If you think about a common tree, it spends its lifetime absorbing carbon-dioxide through photosynthesis (okay at night it absorbs oxygen and releases carbon dioxide, but most of the time . . . ). So, enormous amounts of carbon are trapped in trees, which is why rainforests are so important, and other forests too. However, animals don't collect large amounts of carbon (though they are carbon based). It is this carbon that is so important.\n \n For millions of years, plants collected up unimaginable amounts of carbon and locked it away. Then over the last century or so, we have developed the technology to suck up all this locked up carbon and release it into the atmosphere, and we are now worried that we are running short. So, each year we are releasing the carbon into the atmosphere that took hundreds of thousands of years to be collected by ancient vegetation. Do you see a possible problem here?\n \n And yes, coal and natural gas are also mostly plant based. Lots more stored carbon.\n \n It is probably true that animals do end up in your gas tank, but far more decomposed plant is in there. If you think about a forest or a jungle, you'll probably see far more vegetation that animals life. That's where most of the carbon is, and that the useful bit.\n \n Hope that helped.\n \n Smiley",

Look at it this way as a realistic but theoretical example, go back 300 million years and going forward for 2 million years all of the vegetation and wild life that lived in that 2 MILLION YEAR PERIOD makes up the carbon ingredients that make up the recipe that with the combined pressure, heat, time and decomposition will 298 million years later become the Oil Reserves we drill for today. \n \n Now, you're right that deserts, jungles and Tundra existed, the jungles and Tundra are not the problem though as they contribute to the carbon recipe needed for Oil to be produced according to conventional science.

Geologists Morten Bergan and Johan Petter Nystuen spotted a bone-like fragment in a drill core-a long cylinder of rock from an oil exploration well.\n \n A dinosaur fossil has never been found so far underground, says J\u00f8rn Hurum of the Natural History Museum, University of Oslo. \n \n \"It's a very small piece of bone-about three centimeters [1.2 inches],\" he said. \n \n Hurum, as Norway's only dinosaur researcher, had the difficult task of trying to identify the find. He took a slice from the fossil just a few thousandth of a millimeter thick for microscopic examination. \n \n German Fossils\n \n While the examination confirmed the remains as a dinosaur's, it wasn't until Hurum compared the fossil with specimens in Germany that he made the link.\n \n Plateosaurus was a giant, long-necked plant-eater that grew 30 feet (9.1 meters) long and weighed as much as four tons (4.1 metric tons). An early dinosaur, it is known to have lived in modern-day Europe and Greenland between 210 and 195 million years ago.\n \n \"Plateosaurs have a special kind of bone structure which is not seen in any other dinosaurs from this period,\" Hurum said. \"They were one of the most common dinosaurs. Hundreds of skeletons have been found in Europe.\"\n \n The fossil came from sandstone sediments left by prehistoric rivers that once meandered through dry plains.\n \n \"At that time there was no North Sea,\" Hurum said. \"There was a semi-desert between Norway and Greenland, so it was a dry, arid climate like you see in Morocco today.\"\n \n The researcher says most of the oil fields in the North Sea are in marine sediments rather than in sandstones that were formed on land, and that other deep drilling has yielded fragments of prehistoric sea creatures. \n \n Marine Reptiles\n \n \"We got several drill cores which had fossils of marine reptiles,\" Hurum added. \"Finding a terrestrial animal is much more rare-its like looking for a needle in ten haystacks.\" \n \n Being Norway's sole dino researcher, he appropriately played a hand in uncovering the nation's only known dinosaur.\n \n The country's distinct lack of dinosaur remains is attributed to the Ice Age, which obliterated rock formations that might have harbored these fossils. \n \n \"Most of the rocks in Norway are twice as old as the oldest dinosaur or much older,\" Hurum said. \"All the young rocks were removed and eroded away by the glaciers.\"\n \n He says mainland Norway has a fine fossil record in rocks between 540 and 400 million years old, including marine trilobites and primitive, squid-like species. \n \n \"The only way for us to find a dinosaur is [drilling] in the North Sea,\" Hurum added. \n \n Nystuen, co-finder of the fossil and a geologist at the University of Oslo, says North Sea oil exploration may well add to Norway's dinosaur collection. \n \n \"But,\" he admitted, \"they will be very hard to find and extremely expensive to recover from their very deep tombs.\"",

Under the right conditions you get fossils, under other conditions you get oil. It's impossible to predict with 100% certainty which conditions you had in an area without looking. Geologists can say that oil is likely, but without checking there's no way to be sure that conditions weren't quite right, and that you might not end up with fossils instead.",

   "Wow! This thread has gone way, way off topic. I'm not actually a stickler for keeping any thread strictly to the topic of the OP, since I feel that discussion may logically lead far afield. That seems to be the case here. It seems that this discussion has revealed the scientific ignorance of one particular creationist parrot.\n \n However, rather than start a new thread, I thought that it might be more appropriate to update this one.\n \n I revisited the Houston Museum of Natural Science. This time I took my younger son, an Army SSG, home on convelescent leave. This time I went armed to answer the questions that I had from my first visit.\n \n Early in the exhibit there is a a representation of Lucy's skull, showing Lucy's bones that have been found. Note the similarity to the Australopithecus afarensis composite reconstruction that is built using the principles of bilateral symmetry from 12 A. afarensis skull fossils. Note the transitional nature of the specimens. Apelike brow ridges, low skull vault, large mandible, projecting lower face, no chin, as compared with the much reduced canines and the foramen magnum, located under (rather than at the back of) the skull.\n \n Just before the \"Lucy room\", there was a case with six (not 5 as I previously reported) excellent reproductions of hominid skull fossils. I took notes this time and can now identify each reproduction as follows:\n \n KNM ER 406 (Paranthropus boisei) 1.7 ma male.\n \n OH 5 (Paranthropus boisei) 1.8 ma Orig. Zinjanthropus boisei, then Australopithecus boisei male.\n \n KNM ER 732 (Paranthropus boisei) 1.7 ma female. \n \n KNM ER 1813 (Homo habilis) 1.9 ma\n \n KNM ER 3733 (Homo ergaster) 1.75 ma\n \n Peking Man (Weidenreich Reconstruction) 500-230 ka\n \n But those reproductions were a matter of personal curiosity more than anything else. What I really wanted to see was the small protrusion claimed to be present in Lucy that is at the base of the ulna typical of knuckle walkers. I came with high-res photos of the bones of the human wrist that I laid down on the glass above Lucy's bones. There was that peculiar protrusion at the base of Lucy's ulna that was not present in the photo of the bones of a human wrist. That protrusion is present in knuckle walking apes and Lucy. And yet, Lucy was not a knuckle walker. Her arms were too short, her pelvis was wrong (more like bi-pedals), the angle of the head of the femur indicates that it slanted inward from the hip to place the knee under the body, and the angle of the femur with the shin indicates the same. These are characteristic of a bipedal animal. Thus, as might be expected in a transitional species, Lucy's arms were proportionally longer than ours but shorter than extant apes, her fingers were longer and more curved, making her a better climber. But her pelvis, hip, knee, spine, and skull show that she walked on two legs.\n \n Oh, yeah. Here's Lucy.\n \n Lucy\n \n Lucy\n \n I still love Lucy. I have read more about her with the possible exceptions of Charles Darwin and Jesus Christ.",
