The UK and the US have supported Saddam for many years to come, until the 1st Gulf War. The Bath party(goofy name) was put into power to keep the Muslims/Moslems(however you want to spell it) from having their own form of government, which is what they deserve since they are the majority if Iraqis. Conservatives LOVED Saddam before the 1st Gulf War, when he helped the US fight Iran. Liberals however never liked him, because he was a murdering thug. The placing of the Bath party prooves how bad Western Countries are to the middle east. As for the reason we protest:\n \n 1. Bush's excuse was not for Iraqi Liberation, it was for WMDs, If Bush said it was to liberate the Iraqi people, we wouldn't of though so terribly of the war.\n \n 2. War is terrible.

You blame the deaths in Vietnam on none of the people killing people, not the French colonial gov't, nor theirs and the US' supported Vietnamese military, but the anti-war activists... And the facts you use to support this accusation are... ?\n \n The Vietnam War did not end because of anti-war activists. In fact, the greater movement against the war virtually dissolved immediately after conscription was abolished, and the War did not end for years afterward.\n \n Vietnamese history is incredibly complex, and I don't see how you can make such a sweeping generalization about a conflict that began, literally, thousands of years ago. I suggest you actually inquire into the history of such a conflict, at least to some degree.\n \n The same goes for all the other examples cited.\n \n The death toll in the Balkans had totalled 2000 from both sides, prior to NATO bombings which began in March 1999 (according to Kosovo Albanian sources.) To this day, claims of finding \"mass graves\" are unsubstantiated.\n \n And the US did not 'intervene' in Rwanda because there was no financial or political incentive to do so, as in countless other cases of genocide which the US either ignores or actively supports. Ex., Cambodia, East Timor, Guatemala etc.\n \n Added to this the fact that in many cases, such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Panama, and so on, the horrific dictatorship would not have been possible without US support, and the US aided the violent repression of democratic resistance until the dictator in question stopped taking orders from the US. It is not a secret that many of these people have been on the CIA payroll. That's right, US tax dollars going towards lots and lots of shoes.\n \n I'd like to know how you explain the incredibly friendly relationship between the US gov't and Iraqi gov't simultaneous to ongoing attacks against innocent people prior to the US considering Saddam a threat to their economic interests. Was it just an incredible phenomenal coincidence that occurred repeatedly and throughout US international history? How very lucky that would be for those who stood to benefit from it.

   "Great post mizmaxx! You are probably the second person who is anti-american who's arguments made sense to me. I made a mass e-mail several months ago with the arguements of the other guy and what I had to say about it. (hope it's still going!) I think I'll post it up here, its going to take 3 posts, but I think its interesting...\n \n *** Although the war in Iraq is over now, I think this e-mail still is relevant, especially where it's about Anti-Americanism***\n \n My name is Robbie Hingston. My e-mail is reepicheep75@hotmail.com I started this chain mail because I want people to think about their opinions on the war in Iraq. Please read this through and add your opinion onto the end of it. I especially want arguments that go against the war. Why? I haven't heard many that make sense, but I think the peace protesters have reasons for what they believe. The truth is, since the war has started I haven't heard one single fact that supported the protester's arguments. This is a chance for the peace protesters to defend their beliefs. So, I would like to respectfully challenge pro peace people and pro war people to add reasonable, logical opinions onto this and then e-mail it on. \n \n I think a lot of the peace protester's arguments don't make sense. I mean, what am I supposed to think when they say stuff like 'the Americans only want Iraq's oil' and 'George Bush is an evil dictator who makes Saddam Hussein look like a really nice guy'? Some arguments against the war do make some sense, however. \n \n First of all, what do the pro-peace people say? The following viewpoint is from Mitchell Siemens (chestah69@hotmail.com) from my school. It is basically the most sensible pro-peace viewpoint I have heard.\n \n Mitchell Siemens\n \n 1. Weapons of Mass Destruction\n The main purpose of this war was to get rid of Saddam Hussein's \"weapons of mass destruction\"(nuclear, chemical, and biological). Because of this objective, the war has already failed. There are most likely very few, if not no, WMD in Iraq. The U.N. weapons inspectors have been looking for many years and have found virtually nothing. What little they have found has been destroyed. What are the chances that if highly trained civilians could not find them that a military force could? The discovery of gas masks in an Iraqi military compound led people to believe that the Iraqi soldiers were getting ready for a chemical or biological attack. However, the masks were in a central place, more suited for giving to civilians than giving to military troops in the field. And is it not possible that the Iraqis were getting ready for an American chemical or biological attack?\n \n 2. Getting Rid of Saddam Hussein:\n This was the reason for the war that George Bush told everyone to keep them happy because it's a \"feel-good\" war this way. Of course, they will likely fail in this too. First of all Saddam had friends all over the Arab countries and the world in general. He's likely been planning his escape form Iraq for the last thirty years. Secondly, the major objective of the Afghani conflict was to catch Osama bin Laden. It is almost certain that they failed there too. In fact, the U.S. has a long history of not capturing leaders. They have tried to assassinate Fidel Castro many times. Even in World War II, Adolf Hitler killed himself.\n \n 3. U.S. Imperialism\n This seems to be the real reason for the war. The war may seem too expensive for this, (U.S. estimates are $75 billion for thirty days, plus rebuilding expenses.) but the U.S. recently unveiled a $100 billion tax-cut program just to help its corporations. And because the U.S. is basically the only country fighting this war, Iraq will be theirs for the taking, with tens of millions of people who have never experienced the joys of eating a McDonalds, shopping at Wal-Mart, drinking Coors Lite, smoking Players, or buying a Microsoft computer. There are also millions of litres of oil that the U.S. could use to ease their massive oil imports. And, they'd have a colony right in the middle of the enemy where they could build up a massive military base and just dare the Muslims to come and get them.\n \n 4. George Bush vs. Saddam Hussein:\n Now don't get me wrong, Saddam Hussein is by far the more evil of the two. He has shown this by killing his own civilians, starving them, and using biological weapons. But his actions are, unfortunately, not uncommon in the world. The neighbouring Turks, who the U.S. wanted to ally with, have a long history of killing innocent Kurds too. It is estimated that in the thirty-year long Turko-Kurdish War, more that 50,000 Kurdish civilians have been killed and 2,000,000 made homeless. Nearby Israel, an American ally, has the worst human's rights record in the world, having broken something like sixteen U.N. resolutions. The Ivory Coast, Somalia, South Africa, India, China, North Korea, Cuba, and Chad all have similarly bad records and yet the U.S. does nothing, not even invoke trade sanctions or warn them. Now, which is more dangerous, a very evil man with no friends, or a somewhat bad man with many friends? I would argue that the somewhat bad one is worse, because he's the one who happens to have by far the most weapons of mass destruction in the world. I am referring, of course, to George Bush and the Americans. They have many weapons of mass destruction, but no one has anything better that a rough estimate because, guess what? the Americans don't allow weapons inspectors. And the U.S. is not innocent of hurting people. People in Yugoslavia regularly complain about the American \"peacekeepers\", who often take advantage of the local child prostitutes. The American government has killed thousands by not having public health care. Anyone who is poor cannot afford to live. The U.S. also has a bad record of killing civilians in places like Vietnam and Afghanistan.\n \n 5. Alternatives:\n The best alternative would be for the U.N. to set a, for example, three-month ultimatum period. If after that time, Saddam Hussein had not resigned peacefully and allowed U.N. intervention in forming a new government, a war would be in order, preferably led by the British, Canadians, or some other relatively neutral power. However, the U.N. has not seemed to act quickly on such issues in the past. The next best alternative would be for Saddam to be assassinated, but the U.S. is not extraordinarily good at this. They have been trying to kill Fidel Castro for years, even going to the extreme measure of coating his diving suit with LSD. Again, some relatively neutral party should be put in control of this.\n \n 6. Do the Iraqis Really Want Saddam Gone?\n I don't think the Iraqis want Saddam gone that bad at all. Barring some minority groups such as the Kurds, I think a lot of people support Saddam. Saddam has helped them form their own identity, apart from the commercial American world. Saddam is willing to fight against the Americans and anyone else who threatens their identity. In short, he is something of a cult legend. He has forged a nation by utilizing their common hate of one group: the Americans. Of course, the Americans have done nothing but strengthen this image. First, they supported the Taliban in Afghanistan and then started a war to get them out. They put Saddam into power and supported him against Iran, and then led two Gulf Wars against him. They train Osama bin Laden and then try to assassinate him.\n \n Basically what I am trying to say is that perhaps a lot of what we know about Iraq has been filtered through the media. When you look at the Iraqi point of view, perhaps you will see that the Americans are not the ultra-humane, ultra-just, and ultra-powerful demi-gods they make themselves out to be.",

   "Mitchell's arguments have a good deal of logic and force behind them. Some of it, I think is rather paranoid, but there are good arguments. However, I also think it is completely wrong. Here is my reply.\n \n Robbie Hingston\n \n I think the most popular and effective argument against this war is the deaths of innocent civilians it will cause. But consider this: U.N. sanctions have killed 300,000 people in Iraq since they were begun (according to a conservative study), and Saddam has killed from 500,000 to 2 million of his people during his rule. This war will stop the sanctions and Saddam. Also, whoever the coalition puts in power is likely to work harder to prevent starvation and other problems that Saddam never bothered much about.(he buys million dollar statues and portraits of himself while his people starve) If the coalition leaves Saddam alone he will kill millions more. Even if he dies soon one of his sons will probably take over. They are reported to be as sadistic and cruel as Saddam is. If they don't take over when he dies there will probably be a bloody fight and a new dictator will take over. This war will save far more Iraqi people than it will kill. \n \n While I was first forming my opinion about this war a major question I had was why the U.S. government didn't try to use diplomacy to disarm Saddam of his chemical and biological weapons. However, I now believe diplomacy never would have worked. Saddam hasn't listened to the U.N. for 12 years. He still developed weapons of mass destruction after 17 U.N. resolutions that told him not to. He didn't listen when U.N. sanctions killed so many of his people. \n I still wondered why the U.S. didn't try to use diplomacy anyways. If they had tried, and Saddam hadn't listened, a lot more people would agree with them. So why didn't they? The U.S. planned to pass a U.N. resolution that clearly threatened war if Saddam didn't disarm. Only a resolution that threatens war will ever be listened to by Saddam. However, the French government told them they would veto any resolution that threatened war. It seems to me the French didn't think Saddam would listen, and they didn't want war.\n So, I'm left with one more question. Given that war is the only way to disarm Saddam, is it still worth it? Wouldn't it be easier to keep our armies safe and leave the Iraqi citizens at the mercy of Saddam? I don't think so.\n One person at my school has said that attacking Saddam will make him more likely to use his weapons of mass destruction. The war will make it more likely for him to use them now. In the long run he'd probably use them anyways. He's used them on Iran's army and his own people. This way he's likely to use them on troops that are prepared for it, rather than on unprepared civilians or poorly equipped troops. \n There's also the worry that Saddam may give his weapons to terrorists. There have been no proven ties between him and terrorists. However, Saddam hates America. He has biological and chemical weapons that terrorists could use to kill unprecedented numbers of Americans, or possibly Israelis. Also, he has given 25,000 dollars to the families of each suicide bomber from Palestine in the past. \n Consider this. If the Twin Towers had been destroyed one hour later up to 40,000 innocent Americans could have been killed. The terrorists would have been ecstatic. These terrorists are not trying to make a statement. Their goal is to destroy America. As long as states exist that sponsor terrorism innocent people are at risk. The same states that are a threat to Americans are also a threat to their own people. Millions of people died under the Taliban's rule and millions died under Saddam's rule. It seems to me that the best thing is to just get it over with, rather than worry about the possibility of Saddam using his weapons on his Arab neighbours, Israel, his own people, or giving them to terrorists to use on Americans.\n \n Some people think this war is illegal because the U.N. doesn't support it. I do wonder about this issue. However: the U.N. passed 17 resolutions that Saddam did not listen to. One threatened severe consequences if he didn't comply. I think that makes it technically legal from the U.N.'s perspective. \n Also, I question the U.N.'s credibility. They did nothing during the Rwanda and Kosovo massacres. They have appointed Libya to the human rights chair. Libya has shown it does not believe in human rights by how they have treated their own citizens. Maybe the U.N. can fix its problems. Until it does, I think people shouldn't consider the U.N. to be the ultimate authority in the world.\n \n A lot of people seem to think that this war is about the U.S. becoming an imperial power. They fear the U.S. wants to control the entire world. I was shocked to hear that. This is what one friend of mine said:\n \"The Americans are not acting as imperialists. Empires are founded to generate wealth. U.S. efforts instead cost large amounts of U.S. tax dollars to ensure their security and thereby the security of the Iraqis and the Kuwaitis as well as the other countries in the area. If they were attempting to create an empire they would not have granted independence to the Philippines/Panama.\"\n I agree with that view. This war will cost at least 200 billion dollars for the U.S. Historically, the U.S. has not been imperialist. The U.S. used to control the Philippines and Panama. Those countries are now independent, because the U.S. gave them their freedom. Also, I don't believe the American people want to become an imperial power. The only way the U.S. could become imperialist is if the U.S. government did it behind the backs of the U.S. citizens. How are they going to do that?\n Finally, if this is imperialism - which I really doubt - it is imperialism that saves the lives of the 'conquered' people. This imperialism topples governments that support terrorism and brutally oppress their people. The coalition has said they will leave a democratic government in place. That means it won't have to be pro-American. I expect there will be pressure on them to be pro-American - probably in the form of cash, but they will still have the choice. If the coalition leaves an extremely pro-American government in place I think the Iraqi people will be angry.\n \n A few people have said the coalition should have just assassinated Saddam. At first, this made a lot of sense to me. Then I realized that either one of his party members or another party or one of his sons would take control. This means a bloody civil war or things continuing as they have. Nothing would be accomplished.",

   "Oil - this is one opinion that I have seen no explanation for. Why would Bush fight a clearly unpopular war, risking the lives of American soldiers, to get oil? This war is opposed by 73 million Americans! If the U.S. government does go in and steal the oil the entire world will be very angry. Do you think Tony Blair will support a government that starts a war just to get oil? The U.S. doesn't want Arabs to hate them more. The U.S. doesn't want the world to hate them more. Besides, Saddam is happy to sell his oil - and the U.S. can easily afford it. \n Finally, consider this: Both France and Russia have oil contracts in Iraq. France gets 6 billion dollars a year from theirs. As long a Saddam stays in power they will keep getting oil and money from Iraq. I don't think the French government, or the Russian government, were motivated by oil. I'm just saying that they were more likely to be than the U.S.\n \n Here is one of the best anti-war arguments I've heard:\n \"I think that U.S. should stay out of Iraq because the citizens probably don't want them there. The Iraqi people would be a lot better off if Saddam was out of power. Yet if I were an Iraqi citizen, I wouldn't want U.S. doing it for me. By having the U.S. take charge, it would make me feel inadequate and inferior towards my country. As much as I hated my own leader, I would still stand behind him and try to keep the intruders out of my country. I believe Saddam is a bad man and should be stopped, but I think Bush is going about it the wrong way.\"\n I think it's remarkable that over 3000 Arabs from neighbouring countries have gone into Iraq to volunteer as suicide bombers against U.S. forces. This would seem to be a powerful support for the above opinion. However, these people don't know what it's like to live under Saddam's rule. They have heard propaganda that says Saddam is a hero. They haven't lived in a country where hundreds of thousands die while their leader buys million dollar portraits of himself. ***Very few suicide bombers actually did this***\n Saddam has given orders for deserters from his army to be shot. I think that's a good indicator of how much the Iraqi people want to fight for him.\n People in a town now occupied by coalition troops are still too afraid to publicly criticize him. They vandalized a portrait of him during the night. They still fear that they, or their families will be murdered for criticizing Saddam. This really isn't that surprising. \n In one incident, a Kurdish man was taken, killed, and returned to his family with his eysockets stuffed with paper because his friend had criticized the Iraqi government. Another time, a man was taken from his family by Saddam's government and then was returned to them. He was then shot in front of their eyes.\n In the 1980's Saddam attacked Iran because he feared its new Shiite government would try to get the Shiite people in his country to revolt against him. His army was stopped and Iran attacked back towards Basra - a mostly Shiite city in Iraq. The Iranians hoped the Shiites in Basra would rebel and help their army. They didn't rebel. They were still too loyal to their country. By the time of the Gulf War the same people rebelled when the American government encouraged them to. Years before, they had loved their country so much they didn't rebel when an army of their own religious belief almost reached them. By 1991 they rebelled when the Americans asked them to! Then the American government - and the other nations who saved Kuwait - left the rebels to die. That is why they haven't rebelled this time. They have no reason to trust that the same thing won't happen. I think, however, once the coalition has toppled Saddam, and left, virtually all the Iraqi citizens will be thankful that they are finally free. It has been said that every Iraqi has lost a loved one because of Saddam's tyranny.\n Finally, those who say it should be up to the Iraqi people to overthrow Saddam should consider how many civilian deaths even a successful uprising would cause. The Republican Guard - Saddam's best troops - have shown themselves to be very loyal to Saddam. How would Iraqi citizens fight Iraq's best troops? \n \n The last point I want to make is directed to people who hate Americans. First, you should remember that 73 million Americans do not support this war. Also, if you hate all Americans you are racist. This is what my dictionary says: Racism is \"An irrational belief in the superiority of a given people or nation\". Obviously, an irrational belief that all Americans are inferior is the same thing. It's irrational to hate people just because they are American. There are people in America just like you. It's a diverse country. \n Now, imagine that the U.S. never existed. Was Germany stopped without the help the Americans finally gave half way through WWII? Was Japan stopped? Did the Soviet Union overtly try to take over the world? Was South Korea conquered by the North Korean communist government?\n A recent chain mail asked people to sign a list that opposed the war. This is part of what it said:\n \"We are currently undergoing a worldwide imbalance that could [at worst] lead to a third world war.\"\n This statement is not explained further. I take it that this refers to the fact that the U.S. is the only superpower in the world - with about 50% of the military power. Also, some of the U.S.'s closest allies are very powerful. This, I understand. What I don't understand is how this will lead to the third world war. Why should anyone challenge the U.S. if they know they're going to lose? People say that is what the problem is - there is no one to challenge the U.S. Do you really think the U.S. will take over the world? I think everyone should thank God that the power of the world is held by a democratic government that believes in freedom, and that every man is equal. Balance is not necessarily good. The world used to be balanced. The Soviet Union's power rivalled America's. At the end of WWII the Soviets kept half of Germany. The free world was too tired of war to start another one, so the Cold War began. Think of what it lead to. The Soviet Union very clearly wanted to take over the world. Early on, they surrounded the half of Berlin that the Allies had control of. The Allies organized a massive airlift to save the citizens in their side of Berlin. The Soviets were testing the Allies to see if they would resist. \n They made North Korea communist, and aided them in invading South Korea. American-led troops fought back, and saved South Korea. \n The North Vietnam government became communist - probably because of the influence of the Soviet Union. They attacked the South Vietnamese. The Americans tried to save the South, but failed. Now Vietnam is one of the poorest countries in the world. If the Americans had not existed who would have stopped the Soviets? \n I know that I am presenting the rosy view of the United States. American governments have done awful things. However, I firmly believe that the influence of the United States has been greatly on the positive side for the world.\n \n ***Now the war is over, no Weapons of Mass Destruction have been found so far. I strongly believe that Saddam simply destroyed them. For 12 years he has lied to inspectors and kicked them out at least once. The only sane reason for doing that would be because he had weapons to hide, or planned on building more. The war was worth it, whether there were such weapons or not. The people of Iraq are free from a mass murderer, and a terrorist supporting government is no longer in power. The world is a safer place.***\n \n That is the end of my defence of America, and this war. Please forward it on. If you have something to say, copy this e-mail into a compose, and add your own opinion to the end before sending it on.",

If you want to e-mail me I am at\n lover_man_86@hotmail.com\n \n To begin with the UN's credibility has been undermined by sexual abuse scandals, oil for food scandals, Screbinca and Rwanda. But I want to shine on some facts.\n \n In Sierra Leone 6 UN peacekeepers were taken to a ditch in August, 2000 by the capitol of Freetown and all received a bullet to the blue helmet. These six men came from far away places, not to kill or loot but to keep the peace where peace wasn't there at the time. Forget Iraq, sexual abuse cases, for a second, even though they are extremely important. Six human beings just because they were UN 'blue helmets' were taken to a ditch and executed in cold blood. \n \n In Rwanda on the first day of the violence, the Vice President of Rwanda tried to escape over a compound wall to the UN compound where two UN peacekeepers tried heroically to help her and her family over the wall. One got a bullet to the head for his efforts. Even if she had escaped to the UN compound, the UN peacekeepers were taken from the UN flag-bearing compound, marched down the road to a Hutu militia camp and 10 Belgian Peacekeepers were murdered.\n \n From the Yugoslavia disaster I have a story of UN peacekeeping heroics:\n Sergeant Thomas Hoppe: While commanding an observation post between Muslim and Serb forces in Bosnia Herzegovina, during one six-month tour of duty, Tom Hoppe showed true courage on numerous occasions. In one incident he risked his own life to rescue a group of children pinned down by sniper fire. Sergeant Hoppe was awarded the Medal of Bravery and the Meritorious Service Cross. Now retired and living in Kingston, Tom Hoppe continues to work as an advocate for Canadian military veterans.\n \n In West Timor, three UN aid workers were brutally hacked to pieces on September 6th, 2000. Last year in 2004, 91 UN peacekeepers were killed bringing it to 1,957 UN peacekeepers killed in 59 years.\n \n Finally, on June 8th 1967, a column of Indian peacekeepers flying the blue-UN flag was going to investigate a war crime near a Egyptian village of El Amish where up to 900 Egyptian POWs were executed by Israeli troops. If they had been five minutes later, the UN peacekeepers would be alive today. They came across the Israeli troops that commited this crime and the Israeli tank column opened fire on un-armed UN peacekeepers killing all 14.\n \n The UN has spilled its blood for world peace, and has not resulted in millions been killed.",
