And what if these people get others? And others? \n \n Now here the main part-\n The plot is, what if all these people send letters to their state officials, senators, district attorneys....\n \n That could be THOUSANDS of letters and emails going into offices...PRO gun letters...\n \n \n Im asking everyone to think on this for a minute. \n \n Maybe all this is is just a noble idea, and doomed to fail. But if it worked, if it worked, if we even got 500 people from every state, thats 250,000 letters!\n \n Can the president really ignore 250,000 letters?\n \n Hell, maybe its going to fail. It probably WILL fail. But, its worth a try. I dont see anyone else doing anything. If you guys agree to do this, then theyll be getting at least 1 letter.\n \n This part is, i beleive, i a mjor key to this plans success. All the letters have to be sent on the same date.\n \n Lets try December 10th.\n \n \n Here is a letter to use if you wish-\n \n Dear\n I am writing to you today to show my support for the 2nd amendment right of the people to bear arms. I encourage you to reflect my and many others support as well. Although points were scored for us with the re-election of President George W. Bush, and the expiration of the 'Assault Weapons Ban', as well as the addition of several new pro 2nd amendment senators and congress men and women, we must continue the fight to reclaim what rights guaranteed to us that many states have lost, and ensure that laws such as the 1994 'Assault Weapons Ban' are not passed into being. Such laws only punish law abiding citizens, and deprive them of their rights. I urge you to help us continue to protect the 2nd amendment and fight for its protection. \"Americans have the right and advantage of being armed - unlike the citizens of other countries whose governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.\" (James Madison, The Federalist Papers #46 at 243-244).\n \n Sincerely,",

Sad but true, the old saying of \"give them an inch and they will take a mile\" comes to mind.\n\n \n The assault weapon ban was, to many, just the tip of the iceberg. Now that the NRA has been surpassed in membership by some of the smaller groups (combined, of course) such as GOA, thre is some pretty serious momentum behind efforts to repeal quite a few more gun laws.\n \n I think we can expect the Brady bill to come under fire before long. Requiring a permit in order to practice a constitutionally protected right is illegal. There is no question of that. If the Second Ammendmnet was treated as normal constitutional law, the Brady bill would already be dead. Unfortunatly, the second ammednment is NOT treated as normal constitutional law.\n \n The Brady bill is do nothing, feel good legislation just like the AWB was. The DOJ reports that less than 10% (7% to be exact) of criminals purchase their guns at dealers or gun shows. The brady bill only covers dealers, it does not cover gun shows, though they would like it to (despite the fact that only .7% of criminals got their guns at gun shows). \n \n There is no solid evidence to suggest that the brady bill has made any difference at all, or that it has actually prevented a single person from purchasing a gun. It is difficult to judge effectiveness at all, because the system is so flawed that over 90% of declines are improper. \n \n Another bill that we would like to see go in the trash is the ban on manufacture of machine guns. Since the creation of the NFA (national firearms act, the act that requires special licencing of machine guns) there has NEVER EVER been a case of a legally owned machine gun being used int he comission of ANY crime while in civilian hands. The ONLY time alegally owned machine gun has been tied to the comission of a crime was when a chicago cop shot a drug dealer who mouthed off.\n \n Why, then, with such an exemplary record, are machine guns banned from production? According to the FBI, they seized over 15,000 machine guns last year. Not a single on of them was legal, and not a single one of them was stolen. They were smuggled into the country and sold on the street. Apparently the criminals didn't care that they were banned from import or production.\n \n My problem with the above, in addition to the fact they violate a constitutional right, is that we spend millions a year to enforce them and they do NOTHING. They are simply worhtless, trash legislation. These are laws that were past simply for the pleasure of passing them. For all intents and purposes this is like taking a hundred million in perfectly good money and burning it each year. It is simply stupid. \n \n The pedulum swings both ways, and I think that maybe the anti gunners have had their run. Their research has been discredited, their politicians have been disgraced as liars and their methodology has been exposed and come under pretty serious fire. \n \n We now know for sure what those of us with brains already knew before. You cannot legeslate the actions of criminals. They don't obey the law. \n \n I don't know that htere is really a great deal of data out there suggesting that more guns actually equals less crime. I know there isn't any out there which proves that more gun control equals less crime, or even less guns, so why mess with it?",

The consitution is a very old document, I certainly agree that it needs to be interpreted to modern society, but the no gun control vs. no gun argument is just not a viable option.\n\n \n You are correct in that the constitution is a very old document. Your resoning is flawed in assuming that re-interpeting it in a modern society is the way to go. The supreme court has ruled on many occasions that when interpeting the constitution, the greatest weight mush be given to the original intent of those who wrote it. This is becuase this is the single document upon which our entire nation and its governing structure is based. By declaring that some parts of it are outdated and thus open for a modernistic re-interpetation opens up the whole document for such re-interpetation, basically turning the foundation of our nation into sand.\n \n Built directly into the document is a mechanism for ensuring that it does not ever become obsolete. The constitution can be changed as times change to to keep it current. \n \n The way it stands now, were the second ammendment to be viewed as normal constitutional law, the registration schemes and bans would certainly disapear overnight. The courts have already ruled that you cannot tax a right (making the NFA in its entirety illegal) and that the governemtn cannot require a eprmit in order to exercise a right. The only limit on constitutional rights are that you may not infringe upon the rights of somebody else in the exercise of your rights. That is it. There are no more. \n \n The proper way to assault the second ammendment is to face it head on. An ammendment ot the constitution would solve the problem. This isn't going to happen and we all know it because the logic for including the second ammendment is just as valid today as it was at its conception. Nothing has changed.\n \n Of course, ther is some argument about whether or not the second ammendment could be removed. The constitution does not grant rights, it merely recognises pre-existing rights. Our socity is based on the assumption of natural rights. If the constitution were changed to remove the second ammendment, all it would do is remove official recognition of that leaglly recognised pre existing right.

Let's compare.\n\n \n The bill of rights really only conveys one right, everything else is just a tool. What the Bill of rights essential conveys or recognises is the right to resist tyranny and defend onse nation from agressor, both foreign and domestic. The free speech, RKBA, etc... are all tools to that end.\n \n \nCars and guns are very similar. Both are manufactured, bought, and can be sold second hand. Both have laws governing the use of them. Both can be valuable tools for fun, work, sport, and protection. Both can be used as deadly weapons in the hands of the wrong person. \n \n \n No, they are not. I would certainly agree, though, that driving should certainly be considered a right. Driving is almost essential to life in todays America, and it has become our primary (if not in many cases only) means of travel within the nation. Other, older forms of travel have been largely outlawed (try taking a horse on the interstate and see how far you get). Unfortunatly, as you say, cars weren't around when the constitution was written, and those who came later did not have the foresight to push to ensure that people had the right to drive. Instead it has been redognised by the states as a \"privelage\" which they hand out and retract at will. \n \n \nThe only reason that we have an amendment concerning guns and don't have one concerning cars is that cars were not yet invented in the 1770's. \n \n I find it hard to say that gun ownership is a pre-existing or inborn right, when guns have not always been around. Perhaps cars should be considered a pre-existing right as well, not just a priviledge.\n\n \n We do not have an ammendment concerning guns. We have an ammendment concerning \"arms\", or weapons, which have been around as long as mankind has. \n \n Interestingly enough, for over 100 years following the writing of the constitution, there were literally hundreds of \"common law\" rights that were recognised. Teh right to travel unimpeded was one of them. The bill of rights would not have passed wihtout the inclusion Ammendment 9 and 10, which read:\n \n \nAmendment IX\n \n The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. \n \n \n Amendment X\n \n The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. \n \n \n These had to be included becuase the people at th time enjoyed hundreds of rights, far more than the 10 that are widely accepted today. \n \n Over the years, things that were always considered \"rights\" , such as the right to hunt for food for your family, or the right to engage in business without undue government regulation, or the right to privacy, have been forgotten or slowly infringed upon until they ceased to exist.\n \n One of the most commonly recognised rights was the right to travel unmolested. Think about this in light of current laws regarding DUI checkpoints (which have now branched out to license checkpoints, insurance checkpoints, etc.....) and it is quickly apparent that the right to trvel unmolested is no longer a right, it is a privelage which our governemtn feels free to interfere with.",

Not a single on of them was legal, and not a single one of them was stolen. They were smuggled into the country and sold on the street. Apparently the criminals didn't care that they were banned from import or production.\n \n\n \n I'd like to use that paragraph to define US federal and local control now held over automatic weapons (machine guns). Since 1986 no new full autos have been manufactured for civilian usage. The rules are still the same; an FBI criminal investigation including fingerprints (no felony convictions permitted), $200 tax stamp, BATFE documented transfer through a class 3 dealer (usually $50) and a letter of approval from your local law enforcement agency (or corporate ownership documenting all corporate officers with personal information) allows any US citizen to own an automatic weapon. \n \n What the 1986 law has accomplished is to drive the cost of full auto weapon ownership to what Forbes Magazine calls the best personal investment around. A full auto UZI, any model, was readily available for $2,000 just a few years ago. Original Uzis are no longer offered, most all being held by collectors and investors. A semi-auto UZI, still $800, using pre-1986 registered receivers for full auto conversion, now goes for $6,000. An M16, $3,500 a few years ago, $15,0000 in today's market. MAC10 or Cobray11, $6-800 a few years ago, now $3,000. A WW11 German P40 sub-machine gun, $2,500 a few years ago, now $25,000 up. \n \n The primary driving force behind the increases are shooting ranges offering the public a chance to fire a 'machine gun' and individuals seeing their last chance for auto weapon ownership eventually going beyond the means of all but a select few. \n \n For all practical purposes, civilian ownership of full-auto weapons has been documented to where the government can put its finger on them in a matter of minutes. What has this accomplished? A huge black market for full-auto weapons satisfied by pieces smuggled in from other countries, illegally converted (and often dangerous to users) pieces and widespread theft from civilian ownership, government and law enforcement agencies.

There are now tens of thousands of full auto weapons deemed surplus by police agencies. This is the 'toy factor' as as the firearms industry continues to make advancements to a basic design. No self-respecting law enforcement member is going to carry an 'old' Ruger when the 'big boys' are using $10k MP5s. None of those surplus pieces can ever be sold to civilians under any circumstance. Small agencies where hiring requirements are often being a nephew of the sheriff and having served a full parole term are buying perfectly good full auto weapons for $2-300 when the same model on a registered class 3 receiver saleable to the public goes for $6-10k. The right to bear firearms is, as with most things, a subjective matter.",

With our aging population baby boomers poised to retire, most raised in and from urban centers heading for less congested/expensive areas and at an age that puts them within the largest voting block, rural and semi-rural individualism in many areas will be replaced by cosmopolitan values and that political clout. Combine that with more younger people being forced to metropolitan areas for employment as commercial distribution of consumer goods and services continues to centralize on a regional basis to reduce transportation and labor costs and you'll see a big swap of individual for social group values there. Those of us raised with guns as a normal factor in our lives are a disappearing species. People now want their government, complete with an unbroken stream of failed promises and legislation, to take care of them.",
