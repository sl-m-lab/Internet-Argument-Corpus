It isn't designed to run businesses but to run beurocracies. It spends money, it doesn't earn money. We are being told to pay for a program for the next 4 years before it will actually become active, yet they think we are dumb enough to believe them when they say this is a cost neutral program as if it wont cost us anything in the long run. \n \n It's the lies that get to me more than anything, but every single aspect of this healthcare bill is founded in lies and misinformation. But those on the left defend these lies as if their lives depend on it. I'm truly saddened by todays events; my America is polarized and at opposite ends of the spectrum.
