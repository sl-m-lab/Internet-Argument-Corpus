   "...is coming to light. It is quite a shame that the vast majority of starry-eyed idol-worshipers that voted for this particular lying Marxist do not read enough to figure it out.\n \n Brian Birdnow : It?s All About The ?O?: The Arrogance of Barack Obama - Townhall.com\n \n \n Read the link for the \"aforementioned incidents and quotes\".\n ......\n \n These aforementioned incidents and quotes offer an illustration of Barack Obama's worldview. Like most liberals Obama claims to be receptive to all points of view, but he really tolerates no opinion but his own. He cavalierly dismisses those who disagree with him as \"bitter and frustrated\" and he does not hold himself and his entourage to the standards he easily imposes on everyone else. Barack Obama gave the world many previews of his stunning arrogance long before November 4, 2008. We have seen since then that these examples were not anomalies. The central element of Barack Obama's character is a stunning, almost breathtaking arrogance. The American people will see much more of this in the coming years.",
