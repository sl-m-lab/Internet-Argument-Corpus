The disrespectful angle is clearly because people are less afraid of being disrespectful. If you look at 350 million people against how people actually are victims of violent crime, you'll find that humans have become far more tolerant of one another.\n \n The greatest social issue facing most countries are drugs, and drug related crime. \n \n It only seems we're in a more violent era simply because of the media. Crime is on our T.V. everyday. But when a family gets killed, its national news. In the past, this wouldn't even make the news.\n \n You can walk for months and never meet a person that wants to do you harm.

You are scapegoating because you don't like what is currently popular in entertainment.

Only sociopaths lack this violence immune system.\" Even with trained soldiers, only a percentage of them can easily bring themselves to actually kill in situations other than self-defense.\"\n \n Which isn't true as many animals kill competing members of their own species all the time.\n Killing is VERY natural, you have to be trained to NOT do it, not the reverse as is mentioned here.\n Further more, the author mentions God...not a very good source to mention for anything scientific...more so when you realize that Cain slew Able. Are we to blame the media on that?\n This child on child violence is seen in very small children who can often be found ot fight with each other over toys and such and need to be 'trained' to stop it and learn to share.",

But kids are smart cookies - they catch on quick and I do not believe much in this romantic idea of \"innocence\". Once my son was old enough to understand it we talked about it.

I have never approved of raising children in some bubble that is different than reality and I actually think it can be dangerous. \n \n \nThe people who publish porn and violence have a right to do just that. I have a right to think they are damaging society by pushing hedonism and exaltation of violent behavior on impressionable minds that may subsequently cause their owners to be influenced to do things they shouldn't.
