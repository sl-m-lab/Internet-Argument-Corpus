   "From the editorial page (SA Perspectives, Okay, We Give Up, p 10) of the new issue of Scientific American:\n \n...this magazine's coverage of socalled evolution has been hideously one-sided. For decades, we published articles in every issue that endorsed the ideas of Charles Darwin and his cronies...Why were we so unwilling to suggest that dinosaurs lived 6,000 years ago or that a cataclysmic flood carved the Grand Canyon? Blame the scientists. They dazzled us with their fancy fossils, their radiocarbon dating and their tens of thousands of peer-reviewed journal articles. As editors, we had no business being persuaded by mountains of evidence.\n\n Further along in the article:\n \nwe shamefully mistreated the Intelligent Design (ID) theorists by lumping them in with creationists. Creationists believe that God designed all life, and that's a somewhat religious idea. But ID theorists think that at unspecified times some unnamed superpowerful entity designed life, or maybe just some species, or maybe just some of the stuff in cells. That's what makes ID a superior scientific theory: it doesn't get bogged down in details.\n\n And still more:\n \nWe owe it to our readers to present everybody's ideas equally and not to ignore or discredit theories simply because they lack scientifically credible arguments or facts. Nor should we succumb to the easy mistake of thinking that scientists understand their fields better than, say, U.S. senators or best-selling novelists do. Indeed, if politicians or special-interest groups say things that seem untrue or misleading, our duty as journalists is to quote them without comment or contradiction...In that spirit, we will end the practice of expressing our own views in this space: an editorial page is no place for opinions.\n\n And at last:\n \nThis magazine will be dedicated purely to science, fair and balanced science, and not just the science that scientists say is science.\n",

Pandion has done a very thorough job in a very small amount of space of demonstrating that Arc'Teryx fossils are, in fact, transitional fossils.\n \n I believe that if you allow yourself an honest assessment, you will find the case for evolution is open as more and more evidence is discovered that fits quite neatly into the theory, yet no evidence is ever discovered that contradicts the theory. Perhaps if you were to take the time to educate yourself in the basics of science, you might be able to understand the implications. Best of luck to you in your search for truth. :)\n \n Peace,\n The Bootfitter",

   "I don't know, thebootfitter. The smilies that Hunter used seem to indicate that he understands the motivation behind the Scientific American article, and he is just doing more of the same. His whole post is scientifically illiterate idiocy. He is just carrying on in the spirit of the SA editorial.\n \n For example, he speaks of proof. We are all aware that such demands are made only by scientific illiterates. And the demand for proof is followed by the typical claptrap about leading people away from Jesus. Notice that there is no indication of what Jesus has to do with the question. Typical creationist clap-trap. Hunter was most certainly talking, tongue in cheek.\n \n And then there is the unstated implication that DNA evidence supports the fact that we all came from a single breeding pair. Again, Hunter is repeating claptrap meant to dupe the ignorant, no doubt in the spirit of the SA editorial. Since Hunter brought it up, I'm sure that he is perfectly aware that the most recent DNA evidence indicates that \"Eve\" (at 140,000 years ago) lived some 80,000 years before \"Adam\" (at 60,000 years ago). What we are talking about is our most recent common ancestor (MRCA) traced through mtDNA in the case of the mitochondrial Eve, and our MRCA traced through the X chromosome in the case of the X chromosome Adam. It probably wasn't a good idea to use the names from the Bible in this case, since creationists aren't scientifically literate enough to separate the use of the name from the scientific evidence. I think that this is what Hunter is pointing out.\n \n Of course, the link between \"pond scum\" and liberalism is another nonsense claim. No one in his right mind would make such a statement. I must say, Hunter has done an excellent job of giving us a parody of the ignorance of the creationist position. And that is followed by a reference to \"love\" as a gift from a magical being. We, of course, scratch our heads and wonder what the statement has to do with evolutionary theory.\n \n And of course, Hunter closes with the mandatory reference to what Darwin himself said, followed by an assertion that no transitionals have been found in spite of Darwin's prediction. I'm sure that Hunter is quite aware that in the 150 years since Darwin published his theory, there have been many, many transitionals found.\n \n It is quite clear that Hunter is just going along with the gag simply because he hasn't bothered to comment at all on the Archaeopteryx as a transitional thread. Clearly, Hunter accepts Archy as a transitional, as well as the transitional whale fossils and the well documented horse series.\n \n Hunter is just mocking the ignorance of creationists.

   "Evolution is called a theory because it lacks the scientific proof to be called a fact. Okay then, who can argue with this simple truth?\n\n I wouldn't dream of arguing with the truth. However, your statement isn't it. Your statement demonstrates a profound ignorance and an unwillingness to learn. Attitudes like yours are typically the sign of weak faith. You see, your faith isn't strong enough to accept the universe as God created it, you have to rely on the 3000 year old mythology of nomadic herdsmen. I think that the reason is that such stories are so childish that they are easy for the ignorant to grasp. It certainly saves on learning anything about science, since science requires considerable effort to understand.\n \n For example, anyone who had made an honest effort to learn even the basics of what he claims to oppose would know that theories don't grow up to be facts. That's childish, but it is typical of creationists and \"creation science.\" Creationists begin with the conclusions that they interpret from a literal reading of the mythology of the Bible. Most Christians are perfectly aware of the allegorical nature of much of the Bible - the two creation stories, the flood of Noah, and even the stories of Johah and Job - so ridiculous as history, but serving quite nicely as moral tales. But creationists, after they have decided on the answers, go in search of the questions. Creationists go from the conclusions to the facts by selective twisting and interpretation of the observation.\n \n So it is quite understandable that a creationist would believe that a scientific theory will grow up to be a fact. In actuality, the facts come first. Sometimes a certain combination of facts will suggest an idea to a scientist. They will express that as an hypothesis that is a possible explanation of the facts. This is the wild guess part of science and is one step beyond the operation of \"creation science.\" But the hypothesis still doesn't advance science. First the scientist makes a prediction of further facts that must also be true if the hypothesis is correct. The next step is to design an experiment to test the prediction. If the hypothesis passes the test, in other words, if the predicted facts are observed, then the work is usually published for review by other scientists. When the hypothesis has been tested strongly enough and there is little doubt that it is correct, then it is called a theory. That is as good as it gets in science.\n \n A good example was Einstein's general theory of relativity. One prediction made by Einstein was that light would bend when passing through a strong gravitational field. But the technology to observe that prediction didn't exist for a long time. It was a number of years before it was observed during a total exlipse that a star whose light was passing very close to the sun appeared to be displaced closer to the sun. By that time, however, general relativity had been verified by many other experiments so that it was no longer in doubt. General relativity was a correction to Newton's theory of gravity.\n \n So Hunter. Please at least have the integrity to learn the basics of what you oppose. How else do you know that you oppose it if you don't even know what it is. Why be like most of the rest of the creationists of the world and let someone else do your thinking for you?",

Since you seem to be so intelligent, why is it that you are unaware of this widely known fact, to wit: DNA strictly prohibits the crossing of species and the theory that everything is evolving upward. This simple fact alone makes evolution impossible. Added to that is the fact that there have been no transitional fossils ever found. The theory of evolution is so full of holes that it can never hold water. Einstein believed in creationism, and he damned sure was no dolt. emoticon_xchicken emoticon_xchicken\n\n evolution doesnt move \"upward\", whatever that means. orgnisms that are better adapted to survive in their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. nothing mysterious about it. if it seems as though evolution propels organisms towards continuous improvement, thats the reason why. animals are generally smaller and more agile today because these features give them a competitive advantage over their bigger and slower counterparts.",

They don't fit the definition of being falsifiable in this case. They also contradict every single thing that is known about the way the universe functions, and thus, to actually disprove physics (science in general), you'd need both a theory, and proof, neither of which you, or ANYONE, has, or can have. Unless you can build us a time machine AND give us a logical explanation for your fantasies of \"prohpecies\", etc., you're stuck with good 'ole fashioned reality.\n \n Faith is NOT knowledge. Faith is belief WITHOUT evidence. Knowledge is a belief that is rationally justified by evidence. \n \n If religion is used as a philosophy of life and society, fine, it doesnt NEED to be falsifiable. Most of our philosophies aren't, our ideals are generally not falsifiable either, yet they are important. Likewise religion isn't falsifiable, it's not knowledge, it says NOTHING about \"reality\", but it may indeed be important to you and many others. Just don't try to contradict reality in the process...please.\n \n And I quote:\n \nAll the time science admits that previous beliefs were wrong about numerous things. So how can people really eb confident they know either?\n\n \n Indeed, if science did NOT admit it was wrong, and CORRECT knowledge based on EVIDENCE, it would not be science, and it would not be falsifiable!!!!!!! \n \n The only way we have confidence in ANY knowledge is through evidence, which faith does not require. Therefore, yes, we can have confidence in science, and yes, we cannot have confidence in faith-based declarations. Confidence has no meaning there, it's DOGMA, it cannot be false (or true).\n \n -Mach",
