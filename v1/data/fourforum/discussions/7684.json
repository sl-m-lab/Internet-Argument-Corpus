   "Also, supporting women who want their babies:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/03/health/03hunger.html\n \n March 3, 2006\n Report Warns Malnutrition Begins in Cradle \n By CELIA W. DUGGER\n Nutrition education programs for parents would do a better job than large and politically popular feeding programs in fighting the rampant malnutrition that is stunting the development of more than 100 million children worldwide, a new World Bank report says, finding that a lack of food is usually not the main cause of child malnutrition.\n \n Children are irreversibly damaged by malnutrition by age 2, long before they begin primary school. The World Bank report contends that aid efforts must concentrate on the brief window of opportunity before that age. And in areas not hit by famine or other crises, the report says, efforts must focus more on teaching mothers to properly feed and care for babies and toddlers than on school meal programs.\n \n While experts interviewed yesterday generally agreed with the bank's assessment of the evidence on malnutrition, some of them argued that feeding programs did have an important role to play in improving the nutrition of children.\n \n The debate about how to tackle the problem is an important one at a time when the world is pushing to reduce child mortality by two-thirds over the coming decade. Malnutrition is implicated in more than half of the deaths of children globally, \"a proportion unmatched by an infectious disease since the Black Death,\" the bank's report says.\n \n The World Bank, as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is popularly known, is the largest financier of antipoverty programs in developing countries. Its report, titled \"Repositioning Nutrition as Central to Development,\" maintains that countries like India with staggering rates of malnutrition need to change their approach to speed up progress. \n \n Outside of regions in crises, nutritionists at the bank say, programs should shift their emphasis from directly providing food to changing the behaviors of mothers - for example, to breast-feed exclusively for the first six months of life or seek quick treatment for their children's diarrhea. Improvements to sanitation and health care are also needed.\n \n The origins of malnutrition often lie in the way infants and young children are fed, not the quantity of food available. \n \n In many societies in Africa and South Asia, the first days of thick, yellowish breast milk, called colostrum, are discarded, though it contains antimicrobials that can protect children against infection. It is then replaced with local concoctions that all too often include bad water that can give children diarrhea. For school-age children, nutrition education, iron supplements and deworming medicines are usually better investments for improving nutrition than providing meals, the report says. It acknowledges that feeding programs increase school attendance, but emphasizes that they should not come at the expense of efforts to reach preschool children.\n \n \"You get more bang for your buck without the food,\" said Meera Shekar, the lead author of the report, who described feeding programs as costly and vulnerable to corruption. \"The food brings in votes for politicians. We have very little evidence it improves nutrition.\"\n \n Advocates of feeding programs reply that food can be a magnet that draws mothers and children to centers where nutrition counseling is offered - and that food itself can provide pregnant women and children under 2 with a richer, more varied diet, while attracting older children to school and helping them concentrate on learning.\n \n \"If you feed the children well, they'll all be there,\" said Jean Dreze, an economist and leading advocate of free lunch programs in India, which now serve more than 100 million primary-school students. \"The response to food is phenomenal.\"\n \n Some of the facts about malnutrition, familiar to experts but not widely understood, seem counterintuitive. For example, rates of malnutrition in South Asia, including India, Bangladesh and Nepal, are nearly double those in sub-Saharan Africa, which is much poorer.\n \n India's programs to feed children in school have multiplied in recent years, but its nutrition program for preschool children mainly assists those between the ages of 3 to 6 - too late to prevent the stunting and damage to intellect that occur by age 2, bank nutritionists and other experts say.\n \n A spokesman for the Indian Embassy in Washington said yesterday that he had not yet read the report and could not comment on it. \n \n The problem of malnutrition in India, known for its well-educated, high-tech workers, is striking. Almost half the children are stunted by malnutrition, but the problem is not limited to the poor. A quarter of the children under age 5 in the richest fifth of the population are also underweight and nearly two-thirds are anemic, the report says.\n \n \"Think of the power of India if all these kids were not malnourished and could participate fully,\" Ms. Shekar said.\n \n Nutritionists say the implications of the large body of research that informs the bank's report is clear: countries must intervene before children turn 2.\n \n \"If you miss that period, the damage is irreversible, especially in cognition, but also in growth,\" said Marie Ruel, director of the division of food consumption and nutrition at the International Food Policy Research Institute.",

   "http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/261689_focus05.html\n \n Sunday, March 5, 2006\n Liberating women from macho culture frees all\n DAVID HORSEY\n Women's liberation may yet rescue the world from a population calamity.\n \n That revelation came to me as I sat at a rickety child desk inside a decrepit schoolroom in the hill village of El Salto north of Mexico City. Around me were several smiling children with their mothers and grandmothers. Each of their faces reflected a genetic heritage shared with the ancient people who lived in that land long before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors.\n \n It was late November 2005 and I was in Mexico to receive a journalism award from the Population Institute, an international educational organization based in Washington, D.C., that seeks to increase awareness of the perils of rapid population growth. Other journalists from around the world, as well as Population Institute staffers and supporters, had journeyed with me from Mexico City (at 15 million people, one of the world's largest cities) to this remote little town. The villagers seemed honored by our visit but, by the time we departed, we were the ones who felt honored to have spent time with them.\n \n Rosa Lopez stood at the chalkboard and spoke to us. Lopez was a small woman with minimal education and membership in the world's largest club, the poor, but she had bravely taken on the task of creating a revolution in her community. As the local representative of the Mexican family planning organization, Mexfam, she was teaching the women of her village to stand up for themselves and the men to redefine their image of manhood.\n \n She held up drawings that she uses when she talks to her neighbors. One showed a family locked inside a house, virtual prisoners of the father and husband. Another pictured a wife being forced into sex by an abusive spouse while their children looked on. All the drawings illustrated a type of violence against women and children, from verbal and emotional violence to physical harm.\n \n Lopez's message is that it does not have to be this way; that life will be better when women are free to obtain education and find work, when children can express themselves and live without fear and when men stop using their fists and start opening their hearts. It is the culture of male machismo that she is trying to deconstruct, the set of traditional male attitudes that hold women in subservience in much of Mexico and throughout the developing world.\n \n Lopez brought her husband forward and he testified to the positive change in his own life since he has tried to dispense with the old macho cultural reflexes and become a true partner with his wife. Apparently, El Salto was being transformed, house by house and family by family. As the two Mexicans described this change, I realized very little was being said about population control. Yet it was there in the subtext.\n \n One of the byproducts of empowering women in Mexico has been a dramatic drop in the country's rate of population growth. In 1972, Mexicans averaged seven children per family, one of the highest birth rates in the world. The country appeared to be on the road to ruin with the number of its citizens skyrocketing toward a level that would far outstrip the nation's economic and material resources. Today, that fertility number has dropped to 2.1, bringing Mexico close to the levels of the United States and Europe. It's a remarkable success story.\n \n While Mexico's population has doubled from 50 million to 100 million over the last three decades and is projected to reach 130 million by 2040, at that point it will level off, thanks to the sharp decline in the fertility rate.\n \n What made this happen? A pivotal moment came in 1974 when the Mexican Constitution was amended to guarantee the right of all citizens to choose the number of children they would have and with what frequency. Contraception had been illegal up to that point; all at once, family planning became the law of the land.\n \n The result? Despite the fact that Mexico is heavily Roman Catholic, 74 percent of married woman now use contraceptives.\n \n (More)",

   "In addition, the participation of women in the Mexican economy has increased from 14 percent to 40 percent and the number of years of education for the average female has risen from 3.4 to eight.\n \n The population problem is not yet completely fixed in Mexico. Poor, rural and indigenous women still have high birthrates, and that means the proportion of people in poverty is actually increasing.\n \n And because all the babies born in the high birthrate years are now of working age, there are not enough jobs in Mexico for all of them. That is a big reason why 400,000 Mexicans move to the United States every year and another 500,000 migrate back and forth across the border in search of seasonal work. Whole towns in many parts of Mexico become incomplete communities of women, children and old men bereft of the younger men who head north to find jobs.\n \n Nevertheless, because Mexico has defused its population bomb, it is on the verge of becoming a fully developed economy that should be able to provide for its people in the years to come. By 2015, the working-age population will drop and migration will become less of a necessity. \n \n The day could come when Americans no longer complain about illegal Mexican immigrants and instead wonder who is going to pick their lettuce and apples.\n \n For years, we have all heard dire warnings about the global population explosion and, despite successes such as Mexico, worry is still warranted. The Earth's current total of human beings is 6.5 billion, more than double the number in 1960. By 2050, there will be more than 9 billion of us. Because 99 percent of that growth will be in the poorest countries of the world, the potential for mass starvation, uncontrolled migration and severe environmental damage is huge.\n \n The problem seems so great that it is tempting to opt for ignorance. Why lose sleep over something that cannot be changed? It's easier to plug our ears when some badgering Cassandra delivers the latest bad news about population.\n \n But what if we look at it another way? What if we consider the example of Rosa Lopez and the women of El Salto? What if we make the liberation of women our focus? Suddenly, a happy result might seem more attainable because, woman by woman in poverty-stricken villages throughout the developing world, progress is being made. Micro loans in Central America, AIDS education in Africa, schools for girls in Asia -- in more and more places the seeds of change are being planted.\n \n And when women are better educated, when they can find work that will lift them from poverty, when they are freed from traditional religious and cultural practices that subject them to the cruel whims of unenlightened men, there is an inevitable byproduct: They bear fewer children.\n \n Liberate women and humanity might just be able to save itself from too much of a good thing.\n \n David Horsey is a P-I editorial cartoonist and columnist and member of the P-I Editorial Board.",

Free Will is certainly not something that would come up in it as its such as debatable point and doesn't fit very well with how we know the universe works (doesn't fit very well with religion either, but its a different matter). Animals are prefectly capable of problem solving, which surely shows an intelligent will in many cases.\n \n\n Also, when I say \"personality\", I'm not talking about how you act and your mood, etc., I'm talking about the quality of being a person, that is, a unique, unrepeatable creature that is characterised for having an intelligent free will and whose value in themselves is absolute. A fetus doesn't have a personality in the sense you mean, but it does in the sense I mean.\n A fetus has no free will, unless you are arguing some strange point that free will and the mind are completely seperate, let alone any awareness of itself or other things. Value in themselves is absolute, what does this mean? I fail to see how you can use unrepeatable here as well as something which narrows the field down either\n \n\n And we are superior to all other beings in the most important way: we are creatures gifted with freedom and intelligence. Animals are not free, they are subjects to their instincts, while we are able to create our own acts, and that is why we are responsible for them. You can't punish your cat for eating your bird, he was forced by his programming, while you can punish your son for whatever, because he is responsible, he acted freely. THis is our superiority.\n You can discipline a cat and a dog and it will learn that behaviour is unacceptable much like the child, infact until a few years after birth there isn't a great deal of difference. Not to mention that many primates have a complicated social code, as do dolphins and whales. Even Pigs will form alliances if the experiment rewards them for doing it - its far more complicated than just triggering instincts, they will try to cheat each other and will punish others for cheating them.\n You can put mice and rats in unusual situations and get them to do tasks that they would never have carried out in the wild. It seems like you have an idea of what you think should seperate people from animals, but don't realise how blurred that line is.\n Not to mention again, this doesn't apply to feti.",

Animals are prefectly capable of problem solving, which surely shows an intelligent will in many cases.\n\n \n Anthropology is not the study of cultures, it is the study of the human person. \"Anthros\" is greek for man, and Anthropology is the study of man, both socially and philosophically. The concept of free will I have given fits exactly with religion, in fact, it is the free will of the human person as studied and defined in Cathiolic philosophy. And yes, animals can solve problems, but they do not have a reasoning mind, they have predictable psychological patterns which can be manipulated to give a variety of results. A person is not so easily studied, I think this is pretty obvious.\n \n \n A fetus has no free will, unless you are arguing some strange point that free will and the mind are completely seperate, let alone any awareness of itself or other things. Value in themselves is absolute, what does this mean? I fail to see how you can use unrepeatable here as well as something which narrows the field down either. \n\n \n Of course a fetus has no free will, that is exactly why it is an innocent creature, it is incapable of harming anyone because it is incapable of a free act. However, this does not make it less of a person, because despite the fact it has not developed its capabilities, it has them in potential, something animals can't dream of having. When I say something has an absolute value in themselves, I mean that the value of the human person is independent from what that person does, the condition it is in or the capabilities it has or lacks. This is exactly why abortion, euthanasia or the death penalty are unacceptable, they contradict the very foundation of civilisaton: the respect for the independent dignity (absolute value) of the human person.\n \n \n You can discipline a cat and a dog and it will learn that behaviour is unacceptable much like the child, infact until a few years after birth there isn't a great deal of difference. Not to mention that many primates have a complicated social code, as do dolphins and whales. Even Pigs will form alliances if the experiment rewards them for doing it - its far more complicated than just triggering instincts, they will try to cheat each other and will punish others for cheating them.\n You can put mice and rats in unusual situations and get them to do tasks that they would never have carried out in the wild. It seems like you have an idea of what you think should seperate people from animals, but don't realise how blurred that line is.\n Not to mention again, this doesn't apply to feti.\n\n \n Yes, this is a good point. However, the discipline that animals can learn is always based on the premises of predictability. In other words, an animal will always respond to controlled circumstances in the same, much like a computer will respond the same to the same codes. This is because they have an imprinted programming which, however complex, is never free, it is always predetermined by the preordained instincts, tendencies and patterns of group or solitary behaviour. This includes the behavioural patterns of groups. This is why all animals of the same species will always behave the same under the same circumstances: for instance, as they do in the wild. In a lab, you can gen an animal to do something it would never do in the wild because you understand the springs that make that animal act as it acts in the wild, and trigger those springs with a series of previously determined controlled situations. With people this is never a certainty because you have the factor of free will to consider. People do not react in the same way to similar circumstances because they are free to chose, even with respect to the most basic instincts (for example, voluntary fasting or celibacy go against the instincts we have as biological beings).\n \n Again, the argument of responsibility is relevant here. If you control the behaviour of an animal through a series of different experimental situations, you could never make that animal responsible for what it does, because the animal has no conscience of the consequences of its actions. It does not act freely, it responds to stimuli based on its instincts and previously programmed psychology. A person is always responsible for what they do because they act consciously and thus freely. Could you make a dog responsible for eating a child if it was hungry? It was forced to act by its instinct to survive. However, you can make a person responsible for eating a child, no matter how desperately hungry they were (of course to the point of reasonability).",

   "First off no, anthropology does not mean what you think it does. From Wikipedia\nIn North America, \"anthropology\" is traditionally divided into four sub-disciplines:\n \n physical anthropology or biological anthropology, which studies primate behavior, human evolution, osteology, forensics and population genetics; \n \n cultural anthropology, (called social anthropology in the United Kingdom and now often known as socio-cultural anthropology). Areas studied by cultural anthropologists include social networks, diffusion, social behavior, kinship patterns, law, politics, ideology, religion, beliefs, patterns in production and consumption, exchange, socialization, gender, and other expressions of culture, with strong emphasis on the importance of fieldwork or participant-observation (i.e living among the social group being studied for an extended period of time); \n \n linguistic anthropology, which studies variation in language across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture; and \n archaeology, that studies the material remains of human societies. \n \n Archaeology itself is normally treated as a separate (but related) field in the rest of the world, although closely related to the anthropological field of material culture, which deals with physical objects created or used within a living or past group as mediums of understanding its cultural values\n It is the study of humanity, not of the human person. What you are talking about is philosophy.\n \n As for feti - innoncence does not equal value (why we have no problem killing and using other organisms who apparently have no free will), and it is certainly capable of harming people. The fact it harms people is why there is a topic of abortion in the first place, if it didn't do anything to the mother then people would just put them up for abortion. You're also slowly reducing what is required to be a human being now that 'free will' isn't involved. A sperm has the potential of developing free will, most however don't.\n I'm also going out on a limb and going to say I don't think you accept evolution as true do you? Otherwise you are going to run into problems with your statement that 'animals can not hope to get free will', surely they can because at some point we must have gained it whilst our simpler ancestors did not have it.\n \n As for Free Will - its not really the place to discuss it here, but I'd be happy to continue the discussion in the philosophy forum. I personally don't beleive it exists, people react to a stimulus - not in a set way preprogrammed from birth but people won't become priests randomly out of the blue without being brought up in a culture which may encourage it or at the very least have that option being there.\n \n As for animal experiments - this is just wrong, animals of the same species to not all behave the same. Individuals will behave differently for a variety of factors that would include a wide range of things that would affect humans. Going back to the pigs, some pigs will try to cheat the system, others are more inclined to work together, others will bully the smaller ones into helping. Some dogs are self aware and will recongise themselves in a mirror, others are not able to.\n If you want you can overcome an animals instincts as they learn new behaviours. Even sea anenomes will do this. Of course the factors that affect humans are a lot more variable and diverse due to culture and wider communication, however to just dismiss all animal behaviour as instinct or set pattern's of behaviour is incorrect. Some animals are entirely instinctive, others can alter them and others actually have only a few instincts. Most predators have to be taught how to hunt and learn which are the best targets, they may have an instinct to pounce but they have to learn everything else.

   "First off no, anthropology does not mean what you think it does. From Wikipedia It is the study of humanity, not of the human person. What you are talking about is philosophy.\n\n \n The question of what anthropology is irrelevant to the topic of this debate, however, just so you know, I don't live in North America, and so, as your Wikipedia definition says, I have studied a different definition of this area of science. Anyhow, its irrelevant. And no, philosophy is not the study of man, it is the study of objects and the study of knowledge (\"ongolog&#237;a\" and \"gnoseolog&#237;a\" in Spanish (sorry, I don't know the exact translation to English, but I'm sure there is)). Again, the study of man is anthropology, at least here in Europe, but whatever.\n \n \nAs for feti - innoncence does not equal value (why we have no problem killing and using other organisms who apparently have no free will), and it is certainly capable of harming people. The fact it harms people is why there is a topic of abortion in the first place, if it didn't do anything to the mother then people would just put them up for abortion.

Otherwise you are going to run into problems with your statement that 'animals can not hope to get free will', surely they can because at some point we must have gained it whilst our simpler ancestors did not have it.\n\n \n Innocence is relevant because only humans can be innocent. Animals cannot be innocent because they are incapable of being responsible for their own acts. This is exactly what I am talking about when I speak of free will. And no, a fetus does not harm anyone in an unreasonable way. The possible \"harm\" it could cause its mother is not unjustified, it is the price we must pay for the continuation of our species. The fact that people have become so selfish and ridiculously self-centred (product of extreme liberalist individualism) to the point where we are capable of intellectually justifying the murder of our own descendants (thus questioning the validity of the propagation of our own species and relativising the value of our own lives) is sad. And no, a sperm does not have the potential of having free will as a sperm, it has the potential of creating a being that does have that potential. What we see in conception is not just the union of two cells, but an upgrade, if you will, in the category of what we're facing. A zygote is much MUCH more than a sperm + an egg: it is a human being.\n \n With respect to evolution, I am willing to accept it, yes. But only if we part from the premise that the passage from animal to human is such a categoricaly relevant jump that it extracts us from the evolutionary process. We are more than evolved monkeys, we are creatures the likes of which are incapable of being reproduced. This is why we need more than a scientific definition to fully the grasp the true meaning of the human condition: we need philosophy, anthropology (as I defined it), sociology, history, literature, perhaps even theology.\n \n And when I spoke of potential, I didn't mean to the possibility of a monkey species from developing a level of intelligence comparable to our own (a theory which, in any case, I would be willing to contest, but on other grounds). What I mean is that a living monkey (or whatever animal), during the natural course of its life, will never be like a human, while a fetus will.\n \n \nAs for Free Will - its not really the place to discuss it here, but I'd be happy to continue the discussion in the philosophy forum. I personally don't beleive it exists, people react to a stimulus - not in a set way preprogrammed from birth but people won't become priests randomly out of the blue without being brought up in a culture which may encourage it or at the very least have that option being there.\n\n \n I agree with you, this is not the appropriate forum to discuss free will. Of course, I believe it exists, based basically on the idea of responsibility for one's own acts. But we can discuss that elsewhere.\n \n \nAs for animal experiments - this is just wrong, animals of the same species to not all behave the same. Individuals will behave differently for a variety of factors that would include a wide range of things that would affect humans. Going back to the pigs, some pigs will try to cheat the system, others are more inclined to work together, others will bully the smaller ones into helping. Some dogs are self aware and will recongise themselves in a mirror, others are not able to.\n If you want you can overcome an animals instincts as they learn new behaviours.

Most predators have to be taught how to hunt and learn which are the best targets, they may have an instinct to pounce but they have to learn everything else. Add in the more social primates and whales and its far more complicated.\n\n \n This is a very good point. Of course, there are different categories of animals, the psychological patterns and profiles of animal plankton (if they even have any) is evidently different from that of a whale or a dog. What I mean, however, is that there is a greater difference between a human and a chimpanzee than between a chimp and plankton. A chimp can solve problems, it has a complex psychological pattern, it might even develop a certain degree of individuality. The chasm that separates this from a human is so great I think this should be evident to all. A baby, at a given point, might have the same mental development as an adult monkey, but the difference is that we know that baby is not staying there, we know that what the baby has and is as a human perosn will make it supremely superior to anything the chimp will be able to achieve.\n \n Anyway, I want to ask: why is it so hard for you to make a clear distinction between animals and humans? I know animal cruelty is bad, I know we have to protect our environment. But I think it is reasonable to say that I would gladly provoke the extinction of any species if by doing so I could give a single person a worthy life. Why would it be reasonable to make this choice? Because the life of one single perosn is worrth more than the existence of all other inferior beings, that is why. And this is not wrong, it is accepting that we are responsible for our world, but that we must never forget that the value of that world, is more than just inherent, it also lies in how it is useful to us: how the world can help us become better people, and provide for ourselves, make each person have a good life. This is what is really important.\n \n With respect to abortion, I think its a profound fallacy to put feti at the level of animals, it is to make ourselves less than what we are. To put \"values\" like comfort, ecology or whatever politically correct value above the intrinsical value of our own, of what we must respect above everything: ourselves (and God if you believe). After that we can care for the rest.",

That's when free will appears!' or even to say which one you think is clearly the first modern human. When considered like this I think it is unreasonable to claim that a fetus is any different from something to which at that specific time is physiologically near identical two. Regardless where you look at along that time scale, blastocysts (just a hollow ball of cells) will appear identical, I have a problem saying that one in particular is special even though at the moment all that differs are genes which hasn't been turned on yet. \n \n I don't think you could actually demonstrate free will, or dignity in anything either and the various abilities that very simple and unthinking organisms (like social insects) have would make it complicated to determine whether or not a completely novel organism (hypothetically an alien or suchlike) has those important properties. On the otherhand it would be relatively easy to determine whether you are inflicting suffering on them and certainly not impossible to judge whether or not it is balanced out by the suffering inaction would inflict on others",

   "First off, before responding to you, I think it is relevant and worthwhile to make this important distinction human-animal because from its ignorance many crimes are being committed. Crimes such as abortion, such as euthanasia, but also genocides, extreme poverty (never before seen in out history) in over half of the population of the Earth.... And it irritates me to hear people speaking of the \"rights\" of animals or plants, and be willing to save a rainforest even when by doing so it could cause someone harm (I can give you examples of this if you wish).\n \n \n I admit that philosophy extends beyond 'the study of main' and has different entomology (that is words not insects isn't it?). I wouldn't imagine that Free Will would be a topic a university Anthropology degree covers, the fact that the US alone has it defined the way it does I imagine would set the trend, let alone other European countries recognising the same thing.

In which case I don't think it is a valid argument when it comes to using it to point out physical differences between humans and other organisms.\n\n \n The differences that I want to point out between animals and persons are not merely physical, if that was my idea, then of course the ideas of dignity or free will would be irrelevant. This is why, for example, it is methodically incorrect for scientists (physicists, medical doctors, chemists, biologists, etc.) to claim to comprehend the phenomenon of human freedom or of dignity through knowledge acquired in their own, narrow areas of science. Now, of course I don't want to point out only the physical differences, because on the physical arena, many animals could be said to be superior to man in many aspects (faster, stronger, better armed for certain tasks, etc.). Our superiority lies in other areas.\n \n \n Animals are innocent, surely the fetus isn't only allowed to count as innocent as it will eventually develop the ability to sin? At that point in time it is incapable of sinning, much like an animal. Also not all feti are required for the propagation of the species, we seem to be propagating just fine as it is, if not a little too well in some cases.\n\n \n Only humans can be (strictly speaking) innocent, precisely because we are capable of committing sins. The fact that the fetus will have the capability of making bad choices (again, going back to free will) makes it an innocent creature, because it has not made them. An animal makes no choices, neither bad nor good, it acts not out of freedom, but due to other psychological springs. All feti imply a propagation of the human species, the conception and birth of a human person is, by definition, a propagation of our species. It is irrelevant if that birth takes place in the middle of Mexico City or in some oasis lost in the Sahara. The fact that the current rate of population increase in the world is sufficiently high is no justification for the slaughtering of people (perhaps, on this point, you should consider what happened in China with the \"one child\" policy).\n \n \n Really I think I would take the opposite stance to you, given that the steps we have taken evolutionarily have been very gradual, I don't think if you were presented with an individual from each generation from now to some squirrel like thing you would be able to point to one and say 'There! That's when free will appears!' or even to say which one you think is clearly the first modern human. When considered like this I think it is unreasonable to claim that a fetus is any different from something to which at that specific time is physiologically near identical two. Regardless where you look at along that time scale, blastocysts (just a hollow ball of cells) will appear identical, I have a problem saying that one in particular is special even though at the moment all that differs are genes which hasn't been turned on yet. \n \n I don't think you could actually demonstrate free will, or dignity in anything either and the various abilities that very simple and unthinking organisms (like social insects) have would make it complicated to determine whether or not a completely novel organism (hypothetically an alien or suchlike) has those important properties. On the otherhand it would be relatively easy to determine whether you are inflicting suffering on them and certainly not impossible to judge whether or not it is balanced out by the suffering inaction would inflict on others\n\n \n With respect to evolution, I agree with you, I too think it would be hard to find a single, concrete point in history in which a full human person was born out of some other kind of less evolved creature. With evolution, this is true about all species. However, what is important here is not when it happened, but rather that it happened: it is what we have now. Today, we have creatures called humans that have a special characteristic, they are intelligent and they are free. This is why we mustn't compare feti to animals. Since you like animals so much, lets use an animal example. Would you say that a baby dog, in the womb of its mother, is comparable to, say, a snail? Is the fact that that baby dog has not yet developed all the capabilities of its species enough to make it less than what it is (a dog)? Of course not. A dog is a dog, since conception to death. Just like a human.\n \n The possibility of an alien having free will as we have it is absolutely irrelevant to the topic at hand. The fact is we have not heard of anyone that is similar to us, so lets not hypothesise that much, and lets stay with what is real.",

   "Every form of life that has ever existed are the likes of which are incapable of being reproduced. There is nothing special about humans in this regard at all, we are unusual in the fact that we are the most highly evolved in the self awareness stakes. Thats not to say no other animals are self aware- that is notoriously difficult to test for in the living and utterly impossible to do with life that is extinct.\n\n \n Good point. Every species is, of course, uinique. What I meant is that there is a greater differentiation between humans and animals than among animals. What is special about humans is not only self-awareness (as you said, there are other self-aware animals). The difference, as I have stated repeatedly in my replies to Tastyfish, lies elsewhere, and it is not merely physiological or neurological.\n \n \nThey all study aspects of our nature, I wonder if dolphins would have produced the same if given hands?\n\n \n I think it is fully reasonable to say that no, if given hands dolphins would probably be incapable of producing any form of civilisation. Basically, because to create civilisaton you need to have a society, and there are no animals that live in society, they live in groups and interrelate, yes, but that is not a society.\n \n \nWhy the need to view humans as \"supremely superior?\" We are very smart and versatile but it is blindness to put ourselves on a pedestal above other animals because of our great intellect.\n\n \n If you read my responses to Tastyfish along this thread, you will see that I have rarely spoken of intellect as a clear measure of distinciton between animals and humans. The difference is much more profound, although it is founded, in several ways and levels, on intellect.\n \n \nWhy are all your \"inferoir beings\" inferior to humans at all? I really cannot believe you have such a high opinion of humanity and such a low one of the rest of the animal kingdom.\n\n \n &#205;deologies set aside, using only your common sense, do you consider yourself an equal to a dog, to a fish, to a snail, to an anemone? Would it be indifferent for you if a child was killed to save a dog? Or if a group of people were left without sustenance to save a rainforest? I sincerely hope not.",

   "First off, before responding to you, I think it is relevant and worthwhile to make this important distinction human-animal because from its ignorance many crimes are being committed. Crimes such as abortion, such as euthanasia, but also genocides, extreme poverty (never before seen in out history) in over half of the population of the Earth.... And it irritates me to hear people speaking of the \"rights\" of animals or plants, and be willing to save a rainforest even when by doing so it could cause someone harm (I can give you examples of this if you wish).\n No need, I totally understand what you are saying (though I'd probably say that the extreme poverty is more the greatest difference between haves and have nots rather than poverty, its a very flexible idea). I just think there is a very dangerous yet very easy step to make when it comes to trying to fix this, especially at the moment when you look at different focuses - should we place the survival of rainforests over a brazilian farmer? Yes. Should the issue even be arising where the mexican farmer is in such a state where he is forced to compete with it to maintain the very barest standard of living? No. Whilst I may argue from a point of view that recognises animal rights, I assure you that I'm not looking from a 'ban animal testing and grant rabbits the vote' point of view. I personally beleive that my philosophy takes this into account, more or less.\n \n \n \n\n The differences that I want to point out between animals and persons are not merely physical, if that was my idea, then of course the ideas of dignity or free will would be irrelevant. This is why, for example, it is methodically incorrect for scientists (physicists, medical doctors, chemists, biologists, etc.) to claim to comprehend the phenomenon of human freedom or of dignity through knowledge acquired in their own, narrow areas of science. Now, of course I don't want to point out only the physical differences, because on the physical arena, many animals could be said to be superior to man in many aspects (faster, stronger, better armed for certain tasks, etc.). Our superiority lies in other areas.\n Indeed it does, we are better a problem solving to a degree, though it must be said that for the really hard ones we turn to dumb systems to solve it out the hard way for us. At this very moment in time my computer is assisting in protein folding, its something we can't work out by just thinking about it but it can be done by using billions of processes a minute to work out every possible one and then pick the best.\n Just for the record, hardcore science geek here. So 'purely physical' is a slightly difficult term to use, sure animals can run faster, but the brain is still part of the purely physical aspect if you don't add souls and suchlike.\n However, given that governements are supposed to opperate from a secular point (whether constitutionally guarunteed in some cases, or just regarded as a Good Thing by ours) its this purely naturalistic viewpoint you have to satisfy. If only not to upset Buddists.\n \n \n \n\n Only humans can be (strictly speaking) innocent, precisely because we are capable of committing sins. The fact that the fetus will have the capability of making bad choices (again, going back to free will) makes it an innocent creature, because it has not made them.

The fact that the current rate of population increase in the world is sufficiently high is no justification for the slaughtering of people (perhaps, on this point, you should consider what happened in China with the \"one child\" policy). \n It really depends on the definition of sin you use, given that 'sin' refers to breaking a holy law. A fair few laws that society upholds are not mentioned in various holy books (if commandements against spam advertising emails were included in the Koran or the Bible and had lasted to this day I would be impressed and likely have Jesusguard 3.0 on my PC). Animals are perfectly capable of breaking holy law - I've seen lions eat a pig/warthog and have seen footage of various animals being gay, there is a gay gene in drosophila (fruit flies). I can't see how you can bring free will into this without it becoming a religious arguement, in which case surely it is up to the individual then, with practising Christians refusing abortion and those who don't beleive doing what they think is right. \n \n If we get wierder (I think that unless you consider hypothetical situations that fall outside the normal case you haven't really thought hard enough about the topic (but then I also like brackets)) there will be some cases where it is beneficial to limit our own population for the sake of the species (unless we are hard core Gaians).\n \n Perhaps we should have that Free Will debate, unless you think that you position still holds if animals have free will or neither of us do? If so I'd be happy to continue the debate from a set of assumptions you set (say humans have free will but other organisms don't)\n \n \n \n \n\n With respect to evolution, I agree with you, I too think it would be hard to find a single, concrete point in history in which a full human person was born out of some other kind of less evolved creature.

We both would rescue a baby over a puppy if we were forced to make a split second disicion, if I had to think about it I would still rescue the baby. \n However I don't think you could justify that choice being based on whether a organism has free will or not. The fact that its possible to have a debate over it shows that the issue isn't as clear cut as you may think, other than they consider fewer variables I don't think animal thinking (meaning mammals mostly) is that significantly different than humans. I just think once you reach a point, being able to simulate events as if there was a lion in the long grass and another waiting to respond to our responses to there being a lion in the long grass outweighs being able to run faster up a tree than the majority of lions. Our brains are better, because they can perform more tasks\n [QUOTE}\n The possibility of an alien having free will as we have it is absolutely irrelevant to the topic at hand. The fact is we have not heard of anyone that is similar to us, so lets not hypothesise that much, and lets stay with what is real.[/QUOTE] But that means your entire beleif system will collapse if you met something that wasn't human but behaved like it, I may read too much scfi, but we probably arn't a century from a true AI, or uplifted species, or a digitised human mind, let alone aliens from elsewhere. I don't think you can just exclude such obvious hypothetica examples, if you can't define what it is which makes current humans special.

If only not to upset Buddists.\n\n \n I can't argue with your point on the brain, it makes sense. However, I was arguing about a special human quiality that is derived from a more profound essence, something..... metaphysical (although it would probably be more acurately described as spiritual (not necessarily a soul as understood theologically, but rather using the definition of spirit given by Plato and Aristotle)). I see now we are speaking on different categories. However, I think it's important to understand that the human person is not a union of parts, physical, psychological, spiritual, etc., but a unified entity. So if we are going to make a debate on free will, the categories of that debate will have to lie between the psychological and the spritual (platonic and aristotelic spirit).\n \n \n It really depends on the definition of sin you use, given that 'sin' refers to breaking a holy law. A fair few laws that society upholds are not mentioned in various holy books (if commandements against spam advertising emails were included in the Koran or the Bible and had lasted to this day I would be impressed and likely have Jesusguard 3.0 on my PC).

I can't see how you can bring free will into this without it becoming a religious arguement, in which case surely it is up to the individual then, with practising Christians refusing abortion and those who don't beleive doing what they think is right. \n\n \n A lion eating a pig or animals engaging in homosexual activity is not a rupture of holy law. A rupture of law, in order for it to be relevant, as I have been repeating, must be caused by an act born of free intellegent will. A lion eating a pig or any animal being gay is not making a conscious choice, so they are not breaking any law. The lion eating a pig is satisfying his hunger, and an animal being gay is probably some sort of biological dysfunctionality.\n \n \n If we get wierder (I think that unless you consider hypothetical situations that fall outside the normal case you haven't really thought hard enough about the topic (but then I also like brackets)) there will be some cases where it is beneficial to limit our own population for the sake of the species (unless we are hard core Gaians).\n\n \n Yes, this is important, but killing people is not the appropriate means.\n \n \n Perhaps we should have that Free Will debate, unless you think that you position still holds if animals have free will or neither of us do? If so I'd be happy to continue the debate from a set of assumptions you set (say humans have free will but other organisms don't)\n\n \n I agree, we should start the free will debate in the philosphy forum. Of course if animals have free will or if neither of us do, then I would consider my point stricken down.\n \n \n If you can not indentify that physical characteristic, then it doesn't really exist. We both would rescue a baby over a puppy if we were forced to make a split second disicion, if I had to think about it I would still rescue the baby. \n However I don't think you could justify that choice being based on whether a organism has free will or not.

Also, I think the impulse to save a baby is also born from an inherent tendency to feel more empathy for our own. Anyway, we should have that debate.",

I don't beleive that the ancient greeks had the knowledge or technology to come to a better idea of how the mind works than we do, especially as they didn't just arrive at the idea of a soul but were basing it off a mythological start point.

Its a very complicated and well oiled machine, and one of the most demanding systems we know -everything has to be as efficient as it can be or it will be replaced. If at all possible its far better to put this machine to your use than try to take it to pieces and then try to rebuild it again.",

I don't beleive that the ancient greeks had the knowledge or technology to come to a better idea of how the mind works than we do, especially as they didn't just arrive at the idea of a soul but were basing it off a mythological start point.

Otherwise we have some wierd magic moment where suddenly civilisation and culture appears in some caveman somewhere, rather than just his interactions with other members of his social group becoming increasingly more complex.\n\n \n One thing is to make an inference about the possibility of our civilisation merely being an advanced stage of what animals have, and another completely different is to denaturalise the meaning of these terms. Civilisation, linguistically, is limited to the human area precisely because it is a human phenomenon. To extend the meaning of this word is to destroy that meaning, and leave it (if you allow me the redundance) meaningless. What animals have can be called group patterns or whatever you like, even a lesser step before civilisation, but it is not civilisation. I see that you have a very Darwinian view of history, I think you should reconsider this idea, becaus the development of the world, and of humanity, is not linearly upwards. There is no such thing as constant progress, even in the areas of science and technology. What we have are ups and downs in our history, but to believe that everything will always be moving forward (including animal group patterns becoming civilisations) is I think a bit na&#239;ve.\n \n \n I will admit that I am unfamiliar with a lot of Aristotle and the other greek philosophers, however 'fathers of western thought' is certainly an exgeration from what I've seen. Maths and Science probably owes at least as much to the middle east as the greeks.

Even if Aristotle is the father of modern science, he wouldn't recognise anything from it if he was shown it and vice versa, that this soul as a seat of intelligence and free will concept lasted so long is proof of that.\n \n\n \n First off, the knowledge of mathematics (particularly geometry and except for algebra) the Arabs had was taken from the Greeks. The merit the Arabs had was to preserve that knowledge while in Europe we lived through the Middle Ages. The knowledge of Science the Arabs had is almost exclusively Greek. The Greeks had such an advanced knowledge of the world that a Greek mathematician (whose name I've forgotten) was capable of measuring the circumference of the Earth so precisely that his measurement remained truth until after the Renaissance. The Greeks are the fathers of Western thought: according to St. Thomas Aquinas (one of the greatest philosophers of all time) their philosophy, added to Roman law and Christianity, constitute the three pillars of Western civilisation.\n \n You still don't understand Aristotle's idea. His concept of spirit is not contradictory with your statement that the seat of intelligence is the brain. The word spirit does not indicate, for Aristotle, a supernatural ethereal being, it is merely the name of what he considered to be the core of the human person (be it biologically seated in the brain or in the second toe of the left foot): intelligence and free will.\n \n The fact that Aristotle would not recognise or understand much of modern science is precisely why we call him the father of science. Although he might not completely comprehend quantum physics (although, considering he was a man gifted with a profoundluy penetrating intellect, he might have, given time, grasped it, after all, he was the first to think of the atom), he is the perosn who first designed the scientific method. He was the first to say that science (knowledge, better), must be based on observation of the outside world. All the fundamental, basic, kindergarden level principles of science, which you take for granted and which seem so obvious to you, had to be thought up by some genius mind: Aristotle's.",

This is clear b/c society allows for abortion. \n\n \n So you do agree after all, killing innocent people does harm society? \n \nThey don't...so what's your point? \n \n I'm still hoping that you have something to tell me about how it harms society.\n\n The point is you said: \"So how is killing innocent unborn persons harmful to society?\"\n \n And I said: \"Well, consider what would happen if every pregnancy ended that way?\"\n \n So you can now see how killing innocent people can harm society.\n \n \nSo women should be forced into childbirth to churn out little worker bees to pay taxes?\n\n \n No, they should stop killing humans for the sake of sex. \n \n \nThink about this; that many kids and their kids would've used up environmental resources, tax dollars, jobs, etc. Maybe we'd have made more strides in hydrogen fuel cell technology by now, but we'd be up crapcreek trying to feed them all, educate them all...etc.\n Here is yet another anti-choicer who doesn't care about the children s/he is forcing into life. I like it much better when you're on the moral bandwagon, at least I can empathize with that.\n\n \n Did Bill Gates take up jobs or did he create them?\n \n Do you realise how much energy it requires to make hydrogen? It defeats the objective; besides hydrogen has been around for years as have the prototype cars. \n \n Would you like to be in a collision in a hydrogen car? There would be a mighty explosion if you did, not nice, trust me.",

   "You said I have blood on my hands for eating meat, I demonstrate it is natural to eat meat, so your reply is to justify abortion on the premise that we have opposable thumbs and a brain. That is a weak argument for justifying abortion. In that case everything man does with his hands is justifiable.\nWhilst you claim that anything natural is fine, there is some preliminary research that suggests that a tendancy toward rape maybe partially genetic after studying similar behaviour in the great apes - guess this is fine by you then as its natural. There is really no difference between a organism evolving to be able to eat meat and a society developing some form of technology far as morality goes. Both happened due to pressures and oppertunities - its how you use things that matter, not whether you can.\n \n \n \n\n It makes no difference my reply is a perfect counter claim to your statement. \n \n What is Godwin?\nGodwin's law is part of the internet debating culture, essentially the first person to mention Hitler or the Nazis ends and loses the argument. Clearly we rate things, whether they are people, things or actions. Just because Hitler may have decided that Whites rate over Jews, doesn't mean that because we think victims rate over criminals, or people rate over fetuses, or humans rate over animals we are doing exactly the same he did. If it makes you feel any better Hitler actually had no science backing him up, whereas we do (who ever side you chose).\n \n \n \n\n No one would agree with that, and I would like you to backup that claim with stats. \n\n \n \n\n It is enjoyable to give birth, that is why millions of people do it. Or do you think they do it to damage society as well as to bring stress and pain onto themselves? \n They do it because they want kids, I had certainly been led to beleive that it is very painful though (to the point its not uncommon that very strong pain killers are quitre often prescribed). There are mothers here, I'm sure they will tell you that whilst it may be a wonderful and magical event, it still hurts. Regardless of that even, it is more dangerous.\n \n Type of pregnancy---------------Death rate\n \n Pregnancy termination--------- 0.567 per 100,000 terminations\n Miscarriage----------------------1.19 per 100,000 miscarriages\n Live birth -----------------------7.06 per 100,000 live births\n Ectopic pregnancy ------------ 31.9 per 100,000 ectopic pregnancies\n \n Estimates based on data from <57 million pregnancies in the US from 1991 to 1999.\n \n Reference: Grimes, D. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology 2006; 194:92.\n \n \n\n Are you being silly? Crime is rife! Especially since abortion was introduced. Besides, good people would not exist too, due to abortion. What a weak argument you are making here. \nI've not seen the stats personally, but following the debate I've seen little to make me question them. Perhaps someone else might be able to provide them, not sure where to look and I've not read the book itself. \n \n \n - Innocent people\n Clearly there are a vast number of innocent people with all different circumstances. Feti arn't being selected for death because they are innocent, but on a totally different critera which will not apply to other people in anyway. Its also illegal to kill innocent people because the law doesn't recognise feti as being people, I'd also point out that its illegal to kill people full stop no matter whether they are guilty or not (unless you are at war, or the government but even then its an issue). \n \n \n \n No, not really, the obesity problem of your generation means that your parents will probably out live you. The facts are like this: you need a working population that is bigger than the population in retirement or things turn ugly.\n Nope, means you old folks need to pay your own way with the money you saved up or start working again. People are generally living longer (unless they are as you say particularly unhealthy) and so can work longer, our retirement boundaries were set a very long time ago. At some point someone is going to get it in the shorts as the system changes but there are other ways around the issue than just trying to constantly breed more people. Our society can't breed fast enough even if you had no abortions as the civilised world tends to just try to replace its population rather than constantly expand (which was the way when the original retirement plans were set up)\n \n \n The fewer the workers the higher the taxes, don't even bother attempting to claim abortion will ease the heavy taxes, it just isn't true. You are only demonstrating a lousy knowledge of economics.\nYou need both a quantity and quality of worker to generate a sufficient level of tax to support a large sector of the population. If abortion forces more people to live below the line at which they can not save money for old age, or buts them at significantly lower tax bracket then there is a larger demand for government support later on and less money coming in from taxes (due to more of the total money being earnt lying in lower tax brackets and possibly in the untaxed regions).",

There is no good evidence from large surveys that choosing to terminate an unwanted first pregnancy places a woman at higher risk of subsequent depression than choosing to deliver an unwanted first pregnancy [2]. The frequency of psychiatric diagnoses in women who have undergone an abortion procedure is similar to that in women with no such history. Risk factors for postabortal psychosocial problems include previous or concurrent psychiatric illness, coercion, medical indications that force the patient to chose between possible life threatening complications and termination of a wanted pregnancy, increasing length of gestation, ambivalence, and lack of social support [3,4]. In 1993, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders revised (DSM-IV-R) ceased to recognize abortion as a type of psychosocial stressor.\n \n 1.

You asked for stats. He gave them to you. What do you think of that?\n \n You may object to abortion, fine. But if you claiim it is more unhealthy physically or emotionally to the mother, the numbers just aren't there to back up that claim.
