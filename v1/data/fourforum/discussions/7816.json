   "Many threads have been devoted to the subject of Christianity. This one takes a critical look at Reform Judaism:\n \n What Reform Jews Believe\n \n http://www.beliefnet.com/story/80/story_8054_1.html\n \n Belief in Deity\n Beliefs vary among adherents, including that of nonbelief or questioning belief, and all are welcome and considered personal, but the official stance is that there is one God Almighty--Creator, all-powerful, ever-present, and all knowing--formless, incorporeal spirit. \n \n \u0095 Incarnations\n None, as only God is worshipped. Moses was the greatest of all prophets. \n \n \u0095 Origin of Universe and Life\n Most believe that Genesis is to be understood symbolically. God created and controls all phenomena revealed by modern science. \n \n \u0095 After Death\n Reform Jews believe in the world to come and a messianic age (but no individual Messiah). Personal beliefs in the details of afterlife are diverse, as there is no official position. Some believe in heaven and hell but only as states of consciousness; some believe in reincarnation; some believe God is all-forgiving; and some may not believe in an actual afterlife. Regardless, Judaism generally focuses on living a virtuous life, rather than working toward reward after death. \n \n \u0095 Why Evil?\n No original sin. Most often, Satan is interpreted symbolically to represent selfish desires that are inherent within all. God gave people free will, and people are responsible for their actions. \n \n \u0095 Salvation\n The main emphasis is on living the kind of life that God commands, which will surely be rewarded if there is an afterlife. Most believe God is forgiving of all; there is no hell to which some are condemned. Salvation is achieved through faith and prayer to God, good works, concern for the earth and humanity, and behavior that does no harm to others. The extent to which one follows Jewish Law is an individual decision. \n \n \u0095 Undeserved Suffering\n God gave humans free will to feel pleasure and pain, and his purpose in allowing deep suffering of the innocent must be good even if mysterious. It is generally believed that God suffers along with the sufferer. More important than knowing why God allows suffering is to work to help those in need. \n \n \u0095 Contemporary Issues\n Judaism holds that human life begins upon first breath, and Jewish law requires abortion if necessary to save the mother's life prior to birth. Most believe potential human life should never be terminated casually, but it is generally regarded as a personal decision, especially within the first 40 days of pregnancy. Homosexuality: Homosexuals are God's creation, and Jewish instruction is to love our neighbors as ourselves. Reform (and Conservative) Judaism have a long history of support for homosexual rights. \n \n Discussion?",

   "So, what we have here is a hodgepodge of beliefs that are all over the board, including even non-belief! Some say there is a Creator and some say there is no creator. There is no official recognition of an afterlife, or even a Jewish Messiah. If there is an afterlife, it's based on rewarding works - believing in God is not even necessary (note \"Belief in Deity\" paragraph above). This is somewhat humerous since who is it that's supposedly going to reward those \"good works\" if God doesn't exist?). \n \n As noted in their beliefs, \"Most believe God is forgiving of all.\" One has to wonder then if Reform Jews will feel at ease in eternity with Adolph Hitler and Joseph Stalin and other serial murderers running loose in their midst? \n \n In addition, rather than embrace traditional Judaism which teaches that Homosexual relations are a sin, Reform Jews openly endorse gay sex, saying such behavior is God-created! Evidently there's no moral quidelines for Godly living. \n \n What's more, reincarnation is in too if they want, which is a documented pagan belief contrary to reason and traditional Judaism. \n \n In short, Reform Judaism is pretty much whatever people want to believe, based on their man-made whims. Questions such as, \"What happens to you if you are not a Reform Jew,\" and, \"How many works, and what kind of works, does it take to be rewarded with the afterlife,\" are obviously anyone's guess. \n \n IMO, Reform Judaism is a hodgepodge philosophical structure which is ill-defined, often contradictory to traditional Judaism, etc., man-created, and can certainly incorporate and embrace pagan beliefs and subjective, politically-correct dogma. It's virtually an \"anything goes\" philosophy.",

   "A Reform Jew discusses his religion (excerpts below):\n \n One of the great problems of Reform Judaism, and I am a Reform Jew, is its lack of definition....\n \n Reform Judaism correctly modified a Judaism that was only dependent on belief and added the mental tool of reason to the religion. Reason has all but destroyed faith or belief because it has concluded that all religious truths, including the Revalation at Sinai, the major source of Jewish ethical and ritual law, must be evaluated through logic and these truths or beliefs have only a relative authenticity,i.e., they must be evaluated with a consideration of the historical, social, economic and psychiologocal persectives of the ancient Jews. As a result of this process, the Reform Jew has eliminated all if not almost all binding Jewish Law, and therfore, all or almost all binding behavior. \n \n The Reform Jew identifies himself primarily on the basis of belief. He believes that Judaism authenticates ethics. Yet Christians, agnostics and aetheists appaer to be ethical, and thus Jewish mandated ethiocal behavior does not differentiate and define the Jew.\n \n Many Reform Jews believe that \"God is in us\" which is denounced by traditional Judaism; the traditional concept of God is One who is separate from us and transcends the natural world....At the recent Reform Convention, the President of the Reform Judaism announced his intent that Reform Jews should re-embrace spirituality. \n \n Reform Judaism is by far the largest branch of Judaism, and the loss of membership in Reform Judaism is staggering. Reform Judaism which constitutes the largest segment of liberal Jews needs help...It recognizes that it has a problem. The rabbis have recognized the problem for several decades, but they have been unable or unwilling to solve it.\n \n http://www.mljewish.org/cgi-bin/retrieve.cgi?VOLUME=7&NUMBER=79&FORMAT=html",

   "Religious zealots, arranged right to left\n \n Liberals who want you to be liberal are moral, but Christians who want you to be Christian are bigots (ha ha).\n \n As far as the news media are concerned, there is no religious left, only the religious right and \"mainstream\" denominations - and, of course, the religious right is regularly described as bigoted, narrow-minded and intolerant, not to mention a threat to the separation of church and state.\n \n Yet, within Christianity and Judaism, the left is very much alive, and in Judaism it is dominant. This leftism was made apparent last month in Houston at the biennial convention of the Union for Reform Judaism, the largest of Judaism's denominations.\n \n Let's begin with religious intrusion into politics. This is probably the least defensible charge thrown at the religious right. First, religious individuals and groups have as much right to attempt to influence society and state as secular individuals and groups do. Second, the religious left is at least as active in attempting to influence governmental policies as the religious right. Perhaps more so.\n \n Take, for example, the Reform convention's resolution opposing the nomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr. to the Supreme Court (even before hearings have begun). I am unaware of any Orthodox Jewish convention having passed a resolution against the nomination of secular or liberal judges to the Supreme Court. \n \n A second example was the convention's resolution calling for \"full voting rights\" for the citizens of the District of Columbia. Now, why exactly is that not religious intrusion into politics? And how is that different than when Southern Baptists passed a resolution calling on the United States to keep marriage defined as between a man and a woman? \n \n Such intellectual inconsistencies continued in the keynote address by the head of Reform Jewry, Rabbi Eric Yoffie. The rabbi reserved a portion of his address for an attack on the \"religious right,\" whose leaders, he said, believe that \"unless you attend my church, accept my God and study my sacred text, you cannot be a moral person.\"\n \n As I do not believe Rabbi Yoffie knowingly told a lie, I can only assume that he did not mean what he said. His statement is false. I've never heard of a single mainstream conservative, fundamentalist or right-wing Christian who has said or even hinted at this. It is true that the Christian right largely believes that one must believe in Jesus Christ in order to attain salvation. But \"saved\" is hardly the same as \"moral.\" Christian leaders acknowledge that there are moral non-Christians.\n \n What we have here is left-wing projection: It is the left that believes that if you do not adhere to its values and politics, you cannot be a moral person. Howard Dean recently said that Democrats care if children go to bed hungry at night and Republicans don't. \n \n Rabbi Yoffie also said that \"we need beware of the zealots who want to make their religion the religion of everyone else.\" But isn't that exactly what liberals wish to do - make everyone liberal? Why, pray tell, are liberals who want everyone to be liberal considered moral and moderate, but Christians who want everyone to be Christian considered \"zealots\" and \"bigots\"?\n \n Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the Jewish religious left's convention was how clearly it revealed the supremacy of leftist concerns over Jewish ones. History will record that a month after the Islamic Republic of Iran called for the annihilation of the Jewish state, 5,000 Reform Jews passed resolutions calling for District of Columbia voting rights and \"workers' rights\" but none about a call for what would amount to another Holocaust or about Islamic anti-Semitism generally, the greatest eruption of Jew-hatred since Nazism. History will likewise also note that two years after the United States made war on a bloodthirsty tyrant who paid the families of murderers of Jews $25,000 each, Reform Judaism passed a resolution condemning that war.\n \n As an active member for 15 years of a Reform synagogue that I love, I can only take this as another sign that the movement has been taken over by people whom one rarely hears about - the religious left. \n \n http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/commentary/la-op-prager11dec11,0,7353045.story?coll=la-sunday-commentary (L.A.

More important than knowing why God allows suffering is to work to help those in need. \n \n\n \n Undeserved suffering is a tough problem for any religion: I won't award points to either side on this one.\n \n \nContemporary Issues\n Judaism holds that human life begins upon first breath, and Jewish law requires abortion if necessary to save the mother's life prior to birth. Most believe potential human life should never be terminated casually, but it is generally regarded as a personal decision, especially within the first 40 days of pregnancy. Homosexuality: Homosexuals are God's creation, and Jewish instruction is to love our neighbors as ourselves. Reform (and Conservative) Judaism have a long history of support for homosexual rights.\n \n\n \n Abortion: well, I don't really have a position on abortion (I have opinions about early and late abortion, but where the line between allowable and not is gray ... not something I've devoted much time to), so I won't award points either way.\n \n Homosexuality: Consider homosexuals as people, instead of as abominations that must be killed.\n \n \n Reform Judaism: 7\n EasyRider Christianity: 0\n \n \n Well EasyRider, Looks like a quite lopsided victory for Reform Judaism to me!",

   "Ha. As if we're not allowed to ever question God's existence or deity? \n Then its not a 0-1 to christianity but 1-1, I'll agree with you here, it all depends which denominations we're talking about really. I just find it suprising that given your previous posts here that you could consider someone who wasn't totally convinced about the existance of god a christian \n \n \n \n \n\n No foundation for your claims.\n You have to admit, Jesus as man and god raises some odd situations - essentially deciding that sacrificing yourself is the only way to redeem someone of the sentance you yourself passed... among other things. Even if you can reconceil the apparent difficulties, to just assume that the messiahs are all just normal human prophets is a lot easier and saves you the trouble.\n \n \n \n\n Many Christians also believe it to be that way. So far your 0-3.\n Indeed, but some don't (though I would hazard a guess that some jews don't either). 2-2 or 3-3 really.\n \n \n \n\n A virtuous life according to who? Where's their criteria for what's virtuous?\n You're 0-4.\n Can be said for anyone really, but for the sake of the arguement we could take people of a secular position. Also raises the question whether its more good to behave virtuously if you think you will be rewarded or beleive you won't be. A good life could be seen more as a job, rather than a genuine sacrifice in the case of the former, you are doing specific deeds in return for a reward after death.\n \n \n \n\n They're misguided on that.\n Can't really say, are we looking at this from a secular point of view, from within each sides own beleifs or from opposing religions points of view? \n \n \n \n\n You can't back that one up from the New Testament.\n You're 0-7\nIf you extend it to being tolerated with regard to legislation then its different. Paul is used to justify not granting certain rights and privaledges to homosexual couples quite often, or at least to point out that God considers it wrong and immoral. I'd be curious to hear why you don't think that the laws haven't changed regarding this if God's opinion hasn't.\n \n Regardless, its this sort of thing they are talking about when they say 'wanting to establish a theocracy'. We know they don't really want to establish a theocracy as such, but you yourself have said that Christians should be allowed to support legislation against behaviour they don't beleive in, or which contradicts their moral code. By 'theocracy' they really mean 'why should your religion govern those who don't beleive in it?' This is why christianity comes under attack more here than other religions, especially the more modern ones like reform judaism that have more of a 'live and let live' policy toward non-beleivers. In most people's cases it is christians who are trying to get their beleifs made into law. Those of us who are less concerned about the fate of our souls, or beleive that they are in a better position than yours object to this and will start attacking the reasons that you claim support you law.\n \n The philosophy behind reform judaism, or so it seems to me, is more along the lines of 'religion has been used as a tool of rulers for millenia' which is especially true in the case of the abrahamic ones. Because of this they can't be considered purely divine anymore as they have likely been altered to suit various rulers purposes, due to this when it comes to determining God's true intentions toward something your best bet is to base if off your own conscience as the sense of morality we have been gifted with is the same as God's. Other than the supernatural elements, that seems prefectly reasonable to me as it extends to other beleifs as well. If you are an evangelical or fundamentalist christian or muslim or whatever, you can still do what you think is right. Just be prepared to come up against the law and the government if you start applying your beleif to others against their will.",

   "All you basically said was that Refrom Judaism isn't like normal established religions with a set doctrine shared by all its members. Which to be fair is hardly a unique atribute of it alone (especially if we start to group various demoninations of various religions up together). Attacking reform judaism for lacking a consistant approach to various issues is pretty much like critising evolution for not explaining who it was who designed all the animals - its kind of the point of the idea in the first place.\n \n\n \n I'd be impressed if Trebor would just say what it is he does believe in within Reform Theology. He hasn't even said whether he believes there is a god or not, or whether there's an afterlife, a set of works to get there, or what.\n \n How can you defend something, and give it a name, if you don't even know what it incorporates? \n \n To the length that parts of it were identified as being believed by some, then those parts had serious issues.\n \n In short, it's an \"anything goes\" theology, based on the subjective whims of man. It's nothing you can begin to sink your teeth into, and it sure doesn't appear to be something you want as your platform for stepping off into eternity.",

   "Saying its an 'anything goes' philosophy is a gross over simplifiction though, it is comparable to me saying that religion is just something people use as an excuse to try to lend their view more credability as you can look around and will likely find some group that beleives the same as you.\n \n The idea isn't 'to allow you to do what you want' but more allowing you to act how god communicates he wants you to act, either by acting through the conscience he created for you/you share with him through eating the fruit (metaphorically or otherwise) or by him comunicating with you directly. If we accept that God has an overriding plan for his creation, or even just individuals it can explain the different experiences people are granted. \n \n Its not a set beleif with regard to doctrine, but more an approach to religion where the specifics will vary depending on what the individual experiences (or beleives they do).\n \n Really what Trebor thinks is irrelevant, even in the context of reform theology it will still be 'what Trebor thinks' or 'what God has revealed to Trebor' by one means or another. As I said before, if you want to question it you have to look at it from a more general point of view rather than concentrating on the specifics of various people's beleifs, infact I will start this thread myself then.\n At the very least you have to ask 'why doesn't God reveal himself to individuals?' or 'why isn't each persons seperate role made clear to them?'",

All paths, Arjuna, lead to me. -- Hinduism, Bhagavad Gita 4.11\n \n My Lord, you are one although variously appearing. -- Jainism, Hemachandra \n \n We believe in God, and what has been revealed to us, and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and in what was given to Moses, Jesus, and the Prophets from their land. We make no distinction between any of them, and to God do we submit. -- Islam, Qur'an 3.84\n \n There are righteous men among the nations who have a share in the world to come. -- Judaism, Tosefta Sanhedrin\n \n And Peter opened his mouth and said, \"Truly I believe that God shows no partiality, but in every nation any one who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. -- Christianity, Acts 10:34-35\n \n Just as the sin-offering atones for Israel, so righteousness atones for the peoples of the world. -- Judaism, Talmud\n \n Like the bee, gathering honey from different flowers, the wise man accepts the essence of different scriptures and sees only the good in all religions. -- Hinduism, Srimad Bhagavatam\n \n A man has a faith. If he says \"This is my faith\", so far he maintains truth. But by that he cannot proceed to the absolute conclusion: \"This alone is truth and everything else is false\". -- Buddhism, Majjhima Nikaya",
