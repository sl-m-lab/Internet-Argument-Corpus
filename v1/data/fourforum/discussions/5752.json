   "An interview with Potter Goss, director of the CIA\n \n \nWHEN WILL WE GET OSAMA BIN LADEN? That is a question that goes far deeper than you know. In the chain that you need to successfully wrap up the war on terror, we have some weak links. And I find that until we strengthen all the links, we're probably not going to be able to bring Mr. bin Laden to justice. We are making very good progress on it. But when you go to the very difficult question of dealing with sanctuaries in sovereign states, you're dealing with a problem of our sense of international obligation, fair play. We have to find a way to work in a conventional world in unconventional ways that are acceptable to the international community.\n \n IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF WHERE HE IS. WHERE? I have an excellent idea of where he is.\n\n \n I wonder what the undermeaning of his words is. Do I understand it right he means to fudge on the international obligations and start \"playing unfair\"? I dare say, the US is already playing unfair in Guantanamo prison, Afghanistan and Iraq, and I don't see what can stop it from further playing unfair in, say, Pakistan where bin Laden is likely to be hiding himself. To cap it all, the US encourages its prot\u00e9g\u00e9es to act in the same way. For instance, Georgian President Saakashvili, who feels free to use tortures, political persecution, assassinations and oppression of national minorities. Why, the PACE and OSCE repeatedly report on this but it makes absolutely no effect thanks to the US that frees Georgian President from blame.",
