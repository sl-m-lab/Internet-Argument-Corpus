The left does feel, I believe, that the rich should pay more than the poor. I do disagree, however, with your statement about how hard it is for the rich to stay rich. Capitalism is based upon the premise that wealth creates more wealth. True companies go bankrupt and lose money. But I ask how often the CEO, etc. actually become poor from this?\n Also, what do you mean exactly by rich people shouldn't pay more? For example, simply that we should take the budget of the US, and divide it by the population, and eveyone pay the same amount?\n \n Again, thanks, and welcome to the forum.\n -Dan",

   "OK, well democrats favor things such as gay marriage, taxes on the rich to give to the poor, higher tax rates, open borders, larger government, smaller military, internationalism, pro environment, anti death penalty, and most of all social justice. Basically this seems to me to show that the democrats believe that large government can do better than small government, if everyone had the same amount of money it would be good, the environment is more important than business, and our country should be open to everyone. These are all very idealistic things that in theory if they all worked would create a wonderful society. If we could simply just open our borders to everyone and have it work out just dandy that would be great. If we could have a clean environment while having businesses be successful that would be great. If the poor could just take money from the rich to improve their lives which not affecting the rich people's lifestyle that would be great. If the government actually was efficient enough and successful enough to be able to spend our money better than individuals can spend their money and use this to improve all our lives that would be great. The democrats are idealistic in my view and perhaps one day they will be able to achieve their goals and make this dream of theirs come true. However their long term plan is one that I cannot see them succeeding on if they were given control of the country today. Republicans however seem to try to do what they can for society and basically allow individuals and businesses do the rest. Capitalism works in such as way that this can be successful right now. The only reason the government even needs to be in place is to uphold the laws and control the military. Other than that the society would simply run all by itself without any help. That is basically my view of what the republicans are trying to do and it seems realistic to me. It will of course hurt the environment and not solve world hunger anytime soon but it is at least a good plan based on the governments current capabilities. But don't get me wrong here, I'm not saying all republicans think this way and clearly Bush does not and clearly Clinton was not the democrat that I speak of here. I'm just talking about the goals of the average republican and average democrat and assuming they had 100% control over the country. I think the democrat government would try to control more than they had the ability to control and society would fall apart because of their vision while the republican government would allow the American society to continue on. Still, the best thing for the US may just be that a mix of democrats and republicans hold office and both sides are compeitively trying to help the society. In that way we can get the best of both sides.",

Generally, conservatives seem to be in favor of less federal government involvement in things. This often seems to manifests itself in the idea that corporations can regulate themselves, and be fair to their workers and the environment (something I think is unrealistic and idealistic) and that states can be trusted to do what is right for their people. (Also, I believe, this is often unrealistic and idealisitc as shown by the south's attitude to segration.)\n \n Don't get me wrong, I love the idea that corporations can be trusted, and that states should be allowed to govern themselves, but history just does not seem to indicate this is true.

You fell on hard times, you went to a church (nearly every church had a indigent fund to help you out), or to the salvation army, or goodwill, and they would help you out with paying your bills and keeping your family fed until you could find a new job or get something going as far as putting some money in your pocket. \n \n \n \n \nI am not going to trust anything to charaties. They are unreliable and sporadic. You are trusting in pity parties. People will willingly give up enough money to help everyone else. That's neither human nature nor efficient.\n\n \n But it has always worked. You can argue all you want that it is sporadic or inefficient, but the longest running charitable program in the world has been running out of the basement of a church in boston since 1802.\n \n Even if people cannot be fully expected to give out money from the goodness of their hearts, they can certainly be expected to do it for the tax break.\n \n \nI would rather have the government do it with taxation and reform than private endeavours. Libertarians think privatizing everything is the answer to every problem, when it's not. It's running back to the 18th century, which wasn't all that good for the majority of common people.\n\n \n Of course you would. you prefer a nanny state. I just thank god that there are millions of Americans out there oiling their bolt carriers just waiting for the chance to shoot those who think along the same lines as you should your type ever actually gain enough power to make a significant difference. \n \n Not that it really matters. By giving people a choice of whether to work for a lower wage, or stay home and not work and collect welfare (which in many cases pays better than entry level positions), the libs have effectively destroyed the manufaturing base in this country. \n \n It does not matter one iota what you \"prefer\". Cash is running out of here at the rate of a trillion + per year, JUST in trade deficit (not even going to touch on things like debt service, foreign aid, etc...). It will not be long before there is not enough money left in the country to finance social programs anyway. \n \n This is the problem with your concept here. As warm and fuzzy as it may make you feel to think you are helping out the poor, the idea you are pushing has never worked before, and it does not seem likely it will work in the future. While it certainly helps out some people in the short term, it has always proved ruinous to your ecenomy in the end. Evne coutnries where such systems are apparently working, such as sweden, have some pretty serious problems once you peel back the feel good rhetoric.",

   "Of course eveyrone shouldn't be the same class. I never said that.

They haven't done that well in the past, and the populations have only gotten larger and needs have gotten greater.

This statistic you use is misleading.\n\n \n Odds are less people are helped by private charities at this point, since most Americans don't feel any particular obligation ot help the poor privatly, since it is supposedly all done at a public level. In business, there is a thing called a CBA, or \"cost/benifit analysis\". It is how you decide if you are using your money wisely. Those like yourself who advocate the governement handling any more than is absolutly necessary, need to learn how to do a CBA. In facty, I think that if anybody in government knew how to do a CBA we would be in better shape. If, you have the opportunity to spend 100 billion dollars and help 100 people, or spend 1 billion dollars and help 50 people in the same manner, obviously the wise thing to do is go with the 1 billion dollar program, and encourage it to expand (or do it 100 times). \n \n This is why we have snipers in the military. A grunt with a machine gun can spray a lot of bullets and put down a lot of guys. A sniper can fire one, take down the commander, and end the battle. \n \n \nYou can have 100% efficiency with 5 million dollars, or 30% efficiency with 100 million dollars +.

It is not just a matter of helping the poor, it is a matter of helping the poor without bankrupting your nations. \n \n As I said before, this is pretty much a moot point since witht the trade defcits, budgetary deficits and production numbers we are putting out, there will soon not be enoguh money to run social programs anyway.

People will not donate lots of money or enough to cover the costs of what is needed to make an equitible, morally just society.\n\n \n No, it doesn't. It relies mostly on building a strong economy, which minimizes the need for social welfare programs, like what we had for the majority of this nations history. We know what kind of economic factors lead to poverty. You can either slap a bandaid on it (social programs) or you can treat the root of the problem.

Yet again, no credible source shown.\n \n \n No, it doesn't. It relies mostly on building a strong economy, which minimizes the need for social welfare programs, like what we had for the majority of this nations history. We know what kind of economic factors lead to poverty. You can either slap a bandaid on it (social programs) or you can treat the root of the problem.

There aren't enough jobs out there for everybody, and employers can afford to be highly selective regarding who they hire.\n\n \n In the 19th and 18th century libertarian philosophies, without socialism mixed in, it was far better and cheaper and \"more efficient' economically just to fire non-skilled workers and the poor instead of providing anything for them. Get hurt? oh well, bye bye. Can't afford healthcare? OH well, bye bye? Aren't there any prisons? Aren't there any work camps? If you are lucky, a church might give you some scraps.\n \n This country needs many of the socialist decisions added through history. The only system didn't work normatively, therefore it was changed.\n \n No. It relies on charity for federal programs instead of taxation. The Badnarik Libertarian platform called for getting rid of many programs and replacing them with private charitible agencies, which is ludicrous. Economic efficiency isn't normative socially.\n \n \n have been reading economic reports on such things for years. I am not going to do your homework for you. If you want to refute it, feel free to do soo (you won't be able to). No fari pointing out that social security historically has spent between 1-3% of total revenue on administration costs. Since total revenue for SS over the years has been more than benifits delivered by several orders of magnitude, that tells us nothing (and frankly is a slimy liberal trick).\n \n Maybe this is why they say that if you are young and don't vote liberal you have no heart, and when you get older, if you don't vote conservative, you have no brain.\n \n\n \n Nope kid. You provided information without posting the document and the source, therefore you are making the statement, therefore it's your responsibility bubba, not mine. You make the postive and give \"information\", you must include the source. Burden of proof. It is not the responsibility of anyone in any case to refute what you say. YOu need to prove it. If you're too lazy to show your source and quote, then your concession is accepted.\n \n Postive statement + evidence = provide proof and source. You haven't done that. YOu expect people to go and believe you based on \"faith.\"\n \n \n \n Odds are less people are helped by private charities at this point, since most Americans don't feel any particular obligation ot help the poor privatly, since it is supposedly all done at a public level. In business, there is a thing called a CBA, or \"cost/benifit analysis\". It is how you decide if you are using your money wisely. Those like yourself who advocate the governement handling any more than is absolutly necessary, need to learn how to do a CBA. In facty, I think that if anybody in government knew how to do a CBA we would be in better shape. If, you have the opportunity to spend 100 billion dollars and help 100 people, or spend 1 billion dollars and help 50 people in the same manner, obviously the wise thing to do is go with the 1 billion dollar program, and encourage it to expand (or do it 100 times).\n \n This is why we have snipers in the military. A grunt with a machine gun can spray a lot of bullets and put down a lot of guys. A sniper can fire one, take down the commander, and end the battle.\n \n\n \n \n Duh ya think? Charities don't give as much money and help as many people as the government? Swell analysis. People don't donate nearly as much as is needed and that the Fed's can offer because they are lazy and greedy and people naturally don't give a **** until, they are forced to give a ****.\n \n Yes. I know about marginal analsys and opportunity cost. It's all quite irrelevant to the fact that people will not donate enough money. The didn't prior, and they won't now, and they won't in the future when you regress back to the level of 18th 19th century.\n \n [quote] \n Again, you really need to do a CBA on this. It is not just a matter of helping the poor, it is a matter of helping the poor without bankrupting your nations.\n \n As I said before, this is pretty much a moot point since witht the trade defcits, budgetary deficits and production numbers we are putting out, there will soon not be enoguh money to run social programs anyway. This is largely the result of doing things your way.\n \n \n And you cannot help the poor the way tha tis needed through small private charities.\n \n Government needs to cute the fat an stop pork barreling and use more efficiency. YOu don't have to get EVERYONE and you don't have to spend on all projects, but choose wisely. Not everyone needs to be protected. You help as many as you can without destroying the economy. Taxation is important. Conservatives in the government can't manage their spending. They spend on pointless projects, cut taxes, and then go to war. That's another problem.\n \n \n What determines that a government safety net should be provided for people? That's a built-in escape clause from personal responsibility rationalized by compassion. Our current experience with government charity, because it was easier than facing difficult social issues during our long run of prosperity, has proven that all we've done is create a new class of people. As prosperity continues to diminish and our tax base declines, those government responsibilities are being pushed down to state and municipal levels complete with federal compliance requirements. While potentially a very effective form of wealth redistribution, I can assure you that all it will eventually do is create capital flight, widening the gap in our inevitable two-tier system of have and have not.\n \n Normally, when someone posts an opinion in a forum, it's the task of the questioner to provide references to challenge that statement, allowing the original poster to refute the challenge. A childish 'prove it' response indicates lack of knowledge and/or laziness. But that's what this issue is about, isn't it?\n\n \n You are actually quite wrong. In a debate, the person making the statement to be challenged: \"there was no proverty problem\" or \"times were socially and economically good becaues of libertarian philosophy\" is the one who has to show sources. The questioner doesn't have to do anything. The burden is on the person making the statement of truth. No sources = personal opinion and faith-based evidence. I am not doing the homework for the positive side.\n \n THere are MANY sources which show the opposite in19th and 18th century life. nd focuses quite heavily on the industrial poverty of the late 18th and 19th centuries that was exacerbated by libertarian economic ideology and lassez fair policies.\n \n I cannot access his magical sources, becaues most of them are amorphous, non cited.

That burden of proof rests on the individual saying anything that can be proven. He  must , when asked, provide the evidence.\n \n For example: A 303 engine has massive torque? Does it? Prove it. Man then goes online or cites a quote from a book or academic journal and then proves it. He doesn't spout off an opinion and statistics with no source attatched. NO one can verifiy it.\n \n The challenger doesn't have to provide an oposing opinion untill the facts are proven through sources and those sources are visible. After that, THEN the challenger can post his opinion, and the challener must provide all sources used.\n \n Asking for proof isn't childish or lazy. It's called following debate logic. IT doesn't work that you just say whateve ryou want and expect peopel to hunt down refutation material. That's not how a debate goes.  that  is lazy, but on behalf of the person making a statement.\n \n \n IE\n \n Examples of Burden of Proof\n \n 1. Bill: \"I think that we should invest more money in expanding the interstate system.\"\n Jill: \"I think that would be a bad idea, considering the state of the treasury.\"\n Bill: \"How can anyone be against highway improvements?\"\n \n 2. Bill: \"I think that some people have psychic powers.\"\n Jill: \"What is your proof?\"\n Bill: \"No one has been able to prove that people do not have psychic powers.\"\n \n \n \n \n He is saying that the 18th century and 19th century wasn't bad for many people and that charities were successful. I ask him to provide proof to counter textbooks and most academic articles published which say the opposite. He has yet to provide a credible academic source which says that the Libertarian Lassez fair system of the period prevented and effectively alleviated the mass poverty described in historical texts.\n \n I am not saying his statement is WRONG. I am asking him to provide the SOURCE he got the informatin. Since he's making the claim, he should provide the source. No one else has to provide it but the one making the claim.\n \n IE\n \n If I said that the ratio of cats to dogs in america has remained a stable 4/4 throughout the last 4 decades, I would have to show PROOF of such a claim if someone asked me. WHere did I get the source? Who wrote it? ANd can I access it? \n \n \n \n As another example, in debate the burden of proof is placed on the affirmative team. As a final example, in most cases the burden of proof rests on those who claim something exists (such as Bigfoot, psychic powers, universals, and sense data).\n\n \n \n He's claiming that Libertarian philosophy caused no problems for masses of workers, wage slaves etc. Poverty wasn't a big issue and everything was pretty good. I am not saying anything against it untill I know if the sources are there and credible/shown.\n \n I will provide sources which show the problems of a \"hands\" off government which doesn't get involved and help the people against this \"let alone\" system that relies on the \"goodwill of the charities.\"",

Ayn Rand also likes to praise the 18th -19th century laissez fair system.\n \n According to Jackson J. Spielvogel, who operates a widely used college text: Classical economics was, at its backbone, based on the philosophy of Lassez fair during the 19th and 18the centuries. The government followed the doctrine of \"hands-off.\" This slowly degraded, however, as socialism developed alongside it during the first and second industrial revolutions. One stressed efficiency and economic success (and it is correct), the other stressed other concerns. Both forms, from reading the chapter, when practiced to an extreme, are bad.\n \n This is concurred in my economics textbook.\n \n Contintal industrialization started and developed roughly around 1850-71. This  was  an age of economic prosperity. No one's disputing that. It was, however, also an age of poor conditions due to little government involvement, and mass poverty. Everything and everyone was treated as an economic asset and a means to an end, which goes against Kantian as well as Utility ethics.\n \n Prior to 1870, in europe, capitalist factory owners and businesses were able to hire labour on their own terms, based on market forces. THere were unions, but at the time, they were largely ineffective, and they didn't become effective at producing better wages, hours, shifts, and benefits untill the government stepped in to regulated the classical economic game.\n \n According ot the text \"[B] real change for the industiral proletariate would come only with the development of socialist parties and policies.\"[B]\n \n On a macro-scale, classical economics during the revolutions were GOOD for the nation, but not on a micro scale when dealing with humans. Abstracts yes, faces no.\n \n In actuality, it wasn't untill after 1895 that most of europe experienced any economic boom, but by then, socialist polcies were already in place since the 70's, so it's not due to \"pure\" libertarian economics. The age of mass society came to be and with it socialism that fixed many problems.\n \n Throughout the 19th century, it was SOCIALIST legislation which improved the status of millions, the health codes of worker buildings, and the neighborhoods. This would largely have been ignored by big bussiness capitalists. It's cheaper to fire and forget than to take care of, just like was the case of slaves and slave masters. Washington, for example, spent a paltry less than a dollar on each of his 100 or so slaves during his life, and many masters copied this. According to a People and a Nation, they would most often just get a new slave through breeding rather than treat them well.\n \n The same mentality was at work with the \"hands off\"economics of the 19th century. In 19th century society, the wealthy plutocrats of industry and the upper middle class made up 5% of the population but held about nearly 50% of the wealth. Aristocrats mixed with plutocrats, making the situation worse.\n \n Below these \"fortunate\" ones, were the lower classes of society, how made up 80% of the population.--the labourers, the peasants, the sharcroppers. One out of every seven people in England was a poor domestic servant.\n \n The lower classes only recieved real improvement after the watershed years of the 1870's. (right when socialist practices started to take off). Due to socialists, workers and the masses could now afford to buy more than just food and clothes.\n \n Free and compusory \"mass education\" took off aalso around the late 19th century, so I don't know what you are talking about when you speak of mass compusory education in the early 1800's.\n \n \n Pgs.475-478.\n \n 460-470 Spielvogel A history of Western Civilization",

What programs would you cut? Which pograms are providing as little benifit to society as a whole as our social programs? Since it is already fairly well established that a strong, growing, productive economy is possibly the most effective way to combat poverty (i.e if there truly is a job for every person, you can effectively cut social programs and know with a farily large degree of confidence that anybody who is unemployed is simply lazy), doesn't it make more sense to cut the social programs and turn that money back over to industry as expansion capitol? \n \n I would argue that since social programs inevitably breed laziness, socail programs are the \"fat\" that we need to be trimming. Socail programs are detrimental to any economy. I have not seen a single economic system that spends massively on social programs that has suceeded in the long run. As spending on social programs goes up, there is less capitol available for expansion. In addition, when you make it profitable fro people to NOT work, only a fool would be out there working. So not only have you killed off your expansion capitol, you have effectively removed the lower end of your labor pool from consideration as well. \n \n \n \nYou are actually quite wrong.

If not, you can concede the point.\n \n \nTHere are MANY sources which show the opposite in19th and 18th century life. nd focuses quite heavily on the industrial poverty of the late 18th and 19th centuries that was exacerbated by libertarian economic ideology and lassez fair policies.\n\n \n Then provide some (that would be you refuting). Keep in mind that we are discussing 18th and 19th century America, not europe (which is a whole different ballgame). \n \n \nI cannot access his magical sources, becaues most of them are amorphous, non cited. You make the statement, you provide the direct source that's easily accessible or directly quote/show from it. The only responsibility a person has is providing evidence for the position.\n\n \n No, I provide my analysis of the data which has been available to me. You refute, then I come back and proe my statements (or, more properly, disprove yours).\n \n The problem here seems to be that you lack the sources to launch a proper counter. If that is the case, you concede graciously, you don't start bawling \"prove it\" like a child on a playground.\n \n If this was a magazine article, or an academic research paper, you would be correct, in the name of propreity, everything would need to be cited and we would need (ugh) footnotes. This is not an academic paper. It is a debate. Sniveling does not score any points.",

NO one can verifiy it.\n\n \n No, a 303 is a reworked 327. It is a short stroke engine. Even Chevys modern offering (in the monte carlo) only has 323 ft lbs of torque! Torque is a fanction of displacement and stroke length. While 323 ft lbs of torque is certainly respectable, the modern 350 puts out 389 ft lbs, and the V-10 puts out over 425! these are all right off of chevys spec sheets, which are available at their web page.\n \n See how it is done?\n \n \nThe challenger doesn't have to provide an oposing opinion untill the facts are proven through sources and those sources are visible.

IT doesn't work that you just say whateve ryou want and expect peopel to hunt down refutation material. That's not how a debate goes.  that  is lazy, but on behalf of the person making a statement.\n\n \n Yea, it is pretty much childish and lazy.

God, mental levitation, etc. require burden of proof for opening statement, all of which are circular arguments having no factual basis. Personal belief. In a true debate no materials, reference books, websites, etc. are allowed. All debaters must use their retained knowledge of the subject or face default. That's the object of debate, learned opinions exchanging viewpoints. Otherwise it's just a couple or group of people passing information on a one-sided basis with the knowledgeable party(s) providing a learning session for others. \n \n As children our family was raised with 'If you don't know what you're talking about in a social setting, keep your mouth shut'. If we were curious enough about something, we asked questions of our parents, school teachers and peer group outside the social setting. At that point if our curiosity was strong enough, we were provided the information those parties had available and instructed on how to glean additional information on a subject.

To my mind, especially when dealing with economic matters, either your position is grounded in logic and has been shown historically to work, or it is not. If it is not, you change your position. Money has no friends and no loyalties.\n \n I have mentioned here before that I am a partner in an on line currency trading enterprise.

It has been a lot of years since there was any incentive to get off welfare here in the US. Most people who are currently on welfare never get off, and when their kids get old enough to collect (since they inevitably reproduce, we build benifits for reproduction into the system), they take their kids down and sign them up. The more kids you have, the more money you get, so we are effectively encouraging the dregs of society to reproduce at a disporportionatly high rate, thus ensuring that future generations will have even MORE layabouts to support.\n \n I can certainly understand the reluctance of any major political party to address the issue (that is the case here, too) since nothing motivates career welfare recipients to get out and vote like the suggestion that they might have to get a job.\n \n Personally, I have no problem with reasonable social programs.

No longer are we giving folks the minimum amount needed to keep them complacent. Now we have bred a whole generation of human leeches whose entire existence is Dependant on the legislated charitable contributions of those members of society who are actually productive.\n \n The problem is that we have raised the bar as far as what is expected to keep them complacent. No longer is just a roof over their head and enough food to keep them alive acceptable. Now welfare recipients it he US expect enough cash to be able to purchase and maintain a nice car, have a nice entertainment system, etc...\n \n These things are no longer considered luxuries, but the right of every American welfare recipient. It won't be long before we cannot afford to keep people at this level, and when we fail to do so, electrified fences, attack dogs, roving patrol, and belt fed machine guns may very well start looking more affordable.\n \n I would agree that government programs to help the truly needy is a noble cause. The problem seems to be that governments can not seem to differentiate between \"truly needy\" and \"human leech\".",

   "One looming factor about public services in the US is the current administration's coming effort to push many of those services from the federal level down to state and municipal levels.

When John Engler(R), governor of Michigan, cut the state's welfare role by 250,000 the roar from liberals was almost deafening, but with a Republican Statehouse behind him, he succeeded and even the Democrats in Michigan had to admit that \"tough love\" works. \n \n\n The $240-million-a-year General Assistance Program intended mostly for single adults was eliminated, ending welfare checks for nearly 83,000 people. In the aftermath, Engler was widely viewed as a coldhearted bureaucrat who was more concerned with balancing budgets than with the pain and suffering of poor people. His popularity sank across the state, polls showed. \n As it turned out, Michigan was on the vanguard of a national movement to change welfare, putting more focus on work. By the time Engler sought re-election in 1994, none of the three Democrats seeking the nomination proposed a return to the General Assistance Program. \n http://www.freep.com/news/mich/gov16_20020116.htm \n\n \n I think that for us to break the dependency on the Federal gov't, we need Washington to wean itself off of Federal social engineering programs. At first, send them back to the states with a concommittant reduction in the state's Federal tax burden. Then, let the states decide which programs it wants to keep...and more importantly, fund locally.\n With time, I think that you'd see a curious phenemonon take place. Indigents will \"shop states\" to find the best free benefits initially until the population of that state wises up and quickly moves to become more \"heartless\". I'm guessing that in 10 years, California would be transformed from the land of liberal fruits and nuts to the land of heartless Capitalists as California voters tire from the huge influx of street urchins from across the country seeking \"liberal freebies.\" emoticon_rolleyes",

Apparently wlefare in Chase county is higher than in other parts of the state because chase county is the poorest county in the state and has the highest number of \"disadvantaged\" people per capita (in fact the leeches outnumber the productive folks).

States eat the rest. Medical care will be simple as most states already have legislation in place where no person can be denied medical care.

People don't give enough money: they didn't then, they don't now, and they won't later if you go back to the old system. THe poverty cycle will happen ad infinitum.\n \n Strawman. No one said throw money at the problem. MOney isn't always the problem. How it is used is a problem. Take schools, for example. They spend money on things that don't matter and serve no utility, therefore most of the money is wasted.\n \n Redecorating the gym, auditorium, making a new parking lot over one that's fine. Installing brand new carpet, when the other one was installed a few monthes ago.\n \n \n Maybe you could point us towards and efficient government, or an efficiantly run government program. I nhave not seen one to date, so am having trouble visualising one.\n \n The problem with this plan is that nobdy really seems to have aconcrete definition of \"pork\" or \"trimming the fat\". What programs would you cut? Which pograms are providing as little benifit to society as a whole as our social programs? Since it is already fairly well established that a strong, growing, productive economy is possibly the most effective way to combat poverty (i.e if there truly is a job for every person, you can effectively cut social programs and know with a farily large degree of confidence that anybody who is unemployed is simply lazy), doesn't it make more sense to cut the social programs and turn that money back over to industry as expansion capitol?\n \n I would argue that since social programs inevitably breed laziness, socail programs are the \"fat\" that we need to be trimming. Socail programs are detrimental to any economy. I have not seen a single economic system that spends massively on social programs that has suceeded in the long run. As spending on social programs goes up, there is less capitol available for expansion. In addition, when you make it profitable fro people to NOT work, only a fool would be out there working. So not only have you killed off your expansion capitol, you have effectively removed the lower end of your labor pool from consideration as well.\n \n\n \n If you want to know an efficient, good economic government, you will look at a moderate Libertarian economy. You need, however,  some socialism  to fix some of the inherent problems with the libertarian system. Socialism isn't just big programs (welfare, etc).\n \n \n The problem with this plan is that nobdy really seems to have aconcrete definition of \"pork\" or \"trimming the fat\".

I am not saying that Libertarianism isn't good for the economy as a whole. It's good. However, it needs counterbalancing with some socialistic elements. Yes, people who stay on welfare forever and government misuse of funds is a problem. That needs to be fixed and some things need to be eliminated, but we cannot go back to the Libertarian system of old. It doesn't work on a human scale, as any text--especially teh txts I provided, show.\n \n What do you do for people whom charities cannot help? (which is a lot). Let them starve? This is what was exactly allowed for thousands of people during the industrial revolution. --J.J. Spielvogel.\n \n \n I have not seen a single economic system that spends massively on social programs that has suceeded in the long run. As spending on social programs goes up, there is less capitol available for expansion. In addition, when you make it profitable fro people to NOT work, only a fool would be out there working. So not only have you killed off your expansion capitol, you have effectively removed the lower end of your labor pool from consideration as well.\n \n\n \n Of cousre you don't want huge social programs or tons of them. Some you do need, however. SOme you don't. Getting rid of evertying is bad.\n \n \n \n No. You want to refute, do so. If not, you can concede the point.\n \n\n \n 1. That's part of your position, you provide the source for it. NO one else is required. If you say that poverty wasn't a problem during the 19th century, you must cite where you got that information, or else it's worthless.\n \n I already provided sources which counter the inane idea that poverty was taken care of by charity.\n \n \n \n Then provide some (that would be you refuting). Keep in mind that we are discussing 18th and 19th century America, not europe (which is a whole different ballgame).\n \n\n \n They mention both the US as well as Europe being on a similiar field, and they are both credible texts used by colleges.\n \n \n \n No, I provide my analysis of the data which has been available to me. You refute, then I come back and proe my statements (or, more properly, disprove yours).\n \n \n\n The problem here seems to be that you lack the sources to launch a proper counter. If that is the case, you concede graciously, you don't start bawling \"prove it\" like a child on a playground.\n\n \n No. The problem is you don't provide evidence of your claims. THat's the problem. ANd you need to fix it, since it doesn't coincide with debate structure.\n \n saying that \"prove\" it is bawling is moronic. It's not. Again, if you state something, you must provide the sources for the information, or no one has to give a s h it about your position. It's nothing more than you babbling on and on about your opinion providing no evidence to hold it up. It's not the job of anyone but the person with belief A to provide evidence for believe A.\n \n If this was a magazine article, or an academic research paper, you would be correct, in the name of propreity, everything would need to be cited and we would need (ugh) footnotes. This is not an academic paper. It is a debate. Sniveling does not score any points.\n\n \n \n He who makes the claim bears the burden of proof. For someone to make a totally unreferenced claim and then expect you to run around disproving it is absurd.\n \n That's how a debate works. If you don't wish to comply, it's not a debate. It's an absurdity.\n \n \n \n If this was a magazine article, or an academic research paper, you would be correct, in the name of propreity, everything would need to be cited and we would need (ugh) footnotes. This is not an academic paper. It is a debate. Sniveling does not score any points.\n\n \n Anything or everything you get must be documented if used, or it's not your position. It's information taken from others. THis information isn't verified or credited.\n \n 1. In my debate classes, we couldn't use any source that couldn't be called about to prove our statement, because it's referred to as \"disingenuous\" debate tactic which violates BoP.\n \n 2. Refer to the above: He who makes the claim bears the burden of proof. For someone to make a totally unreferenced claim and then expect you to run around disproving it is absurd.. You claimed that the 18th and 19th centuries didn't have a problem with poverty and that the system worked well. I don't have to disprove anything you say untill it's referenced. I wouldn't expect you to run around looking for something that doesn't exist.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n \n \n No, a 303 is a reworked 327. It is a short stroke engine. Even Chevys modern offering (in the monte carlo) only has 323 ft lbs of torque! Torque is a fanction of displacement and stroke length. While 323 ft lbs of torque is certainly respectable, the modern 350 puts out 389 ft lbs, and the V-10 puts out over 425! these are all right off of chevys spec sheets, which are available at their web page.\n \n See how it is done?\n\n \n Useless comment. Not referenced = you have no support. IT's just you saying something. It's words with no backbone. No one else has that source. No one is expected to run around refuting what you can't even back up yourself. That's sophistry.\n \n \n Here is her problem. She can't find any sources with which to refute, so she is hoping to use mine, or attack their validity. This is why it is the responsibilty of the other party to refute.\n \n\n \n False. No source provided = worthless post. And yes. You must have valid sources. The same goes for any academic discussion. YOu don't use the NY times to discuss chemistry. You use Canon and offical material.\n \n You only refute something with which you disagree. I am not disagreeing. I am telling you to provide your source, which is required to show validity, actual holding of a source, and that you aren't just making **** up off the top of your head.\n \n This isn't a TV debate where each party can just lie to each other and not provide concrete facts to back it up.\n \n \n \n Yea, it is pretty much childish and lazy. If you want to refute the point, you hunt down material with which to do it. If you can't find any, or don't have eny, you concede graciously, hopefully having learned something.\n\n \n Incorrect. It's childish and lazy and incorrect debate structure not to provide evidence for a claim. If you make a claim, you must provide evidence or you concede that you have no evidence and that it's a mere opinion. No one has to refute an unsubstantiated claim.

As you can clearly see, when you shift the burden of proof onto the person denying or questioning an assertion (A), you are acting fallaciously according to logic.\n \n \n I could care less if I am outnumbered. Saying you are right because you outnumber me is another fallacy: Appeal to Numbers.\n \n \n The above fallacy is also related to another logical fallacy used in debate: The authority in question is not named. This is a type of\n appeal to authority because when an authority is not named\n it is impossible to confirm that the authority is an expert.\n However the fallacy is so common it deserves special\n mention.\n \n A variation on this fallacy is the appeal to rumour. Because\n the source of a rumour is typically not known, it is not\n possible to determine whether to believe the rumour. \n \n This is why you must provide a credible source and a credible authority. NOt an amphibolous statement with no source. Anyone can ******** and make up statistics and numbers and people and positions.\n \n Example of this and how to combat it:  (i) A government official said today that the new gun law\n will be proposed tomorrow.\n (ii) Experts agree that the best way to prevent nuclear war\n is to prepare for it.\n (iii) It is held that there are more than two million needless\n operations conducted every year.\n (iv) Rumour has it that the Prime Minster will declare\n another holiday in October.\n \n Proof:\n \n Argue that because we don't know the source of the\n information we have no way to evaluate the reliability of the\n information.\\\n \n Since you have no source you provide, there is no way to validate the information or deem it reliable.

   "If you look at the rate of education from 1850 to about 1900, you will see that the rate of education and number of peopel attending education increased dramatically due to socialist legislation which allowed for \"mass\" education around 1866-1870, as described by Jackon J. Spielvogel as well as Howard Zinn in their history texts.\n \n It wasn't untill around this point that people were introducted to compuslory education. Many people never went beyond grammar school, and very few went to highschool. Around the age of mass society, which was the 70's90's, many more people were educated in public schools.\n \n Private schools are difficult to judge, becaues they do not have to report anything and they have zero administrative responsibility. Many people in the 18th and 19th century (early), who were educated, were the wealthier people and those who could afford a private education. Many remained undereducated or illiterate as a result, untill socialist legislation changed this.\n \n Today, the socialism is going to far, and it's giving too much power to educational beurocrats, which causes major problems. However, limited socialism isn't the problem. With private educations, you are going back to 19th century education standards of private, competitive, libertarian, with no regulation. And yes. Libertarianims  is based  exactly on the same 19th century philosophy as I showed earlier. It happened then, and without rules and regulation, it will just happen again.\n \n http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/newlong2.php\n \n \n From 1850 through the mass society period, white adult literarcy rates went up because of instutionalized education. As mentioned in history texts earlier, many couldn't afford to go to schools under a private system and personal tutoring. Many were illiterate.\n \n http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/newlong2.php\n \n This information correleates with chapt 20 in Spielvogel's text, which describes the impact of mass education over private education. Libertarianism is a good economic theory,but it cannot be applied to every area.\n \n \n Howard Zinn's: A People's history of the United States also goes into great depth in explaining the vast increases in worker and middle class benefits and wealth during the age of mass society, in which Socialist programs made their lives far more livable and humane. He and Spielvogel go into great depth explaining the gains of socialist programs in reference to worker and middle class job security, health, wages, hours etc.\n \n You seem to think all socialism is bad. I only think extreme socialism is bad.

From the colonial period to\n the present day, large numbers of Americans have been poor:\n they have lacked the resources to feed, clothe, and shelter\n themselves adequately according to socially defined standards.\n Just how many Americans have lived in poverty over the course\n of more than three centuries is impossible to gauge; not only are\n data scarce, but the definition of poverty has changed too often\n (and is too subject to debate) to permit precise measurement.\n Nonetheless, there can be no doubt that poverty, as a personal\n condition and as a social problem, has long been a prominent\n feature of the economic and social landscape.\n\n \n \n In the course of the eighteenth century, poverty became a more\n visible social problem, particularly in the port cities of the\n North.  In Boston, New York, and Philadelphia,\n for example, the number of people needing public assistance\n rose dramatically during and after the Seven Years' War. By the\n end of the century, according to some national estimates,\n virtually all African-Americans (slave and free) and between\n one-fifth and one-third of all whites lived in poverty.\n\n \n \n ]B]Despite economic growth fueled by agricultural expansion and\n the Industrial Revolution, the problem of poverty did not\n become any less acute in the nineteenth century.[/B]\n\n \n \n Poverty, Robert Hunter, citing Jacob Riis,\n noted that 10 percent of the people who died in New York City\n between 1885 and 1890 had been given a pauper's burial; he\n also claimed that 20 percent of the population of Boston lived\n in actual distress.\n\n \n \n In the nation as a whole, Hunter estimated\n that 10 million people, roughly 12 percent of the population,\n were poor at the turn of the century. More recent analysts have\n concluded that Hunter's estimates - distressing as they may have\n been to contemporaries - were far too low, that, in fact, a\n broader definition of poverty would have embraced roughly 40\n percent of all Americans\n \n \n \n \n 10 million destitute people is a major problem--a problem not dealt with my Libertarian 19th century scrougeism.

It's not my job to find out how they get the information, only that it's part of a legitimate academic source. Being part of a college curriculum means it's highly likely that it's accurate and worth something. \n \n \n And again, you have failed to prove, or even provide any kind of thought provoking argument, that it existed at all. Your source here starts by stating that they have no data or measurement on the topic, even going so far as to say that the data does not exist. Lets go back for a second and examine my original argument, so you know what you are trying to refute (I honestly had to go back and look myself).\n\n \n Source was provided from an academic unit. That's enough, since it say sthe opposite, and textbooks in colleges as well as the journals on their databases are selected and reviewed.\n \n \n I contended that-----\n \n 1-Government programs are by their very nature inefficient.\n 2-The economic situation in 17th-19th century America was not one conducive to wide spread poverty.\n 3-Data regarding poverty during the period is virtually non existant, which I contend is because it was not enough of a problem to bother keeping it.\n \n\n \n 1. I agreed with you on one, and I still do.\n 2. THe second one I am correct, since all historical sources say the same, and I am only required to provide those sources. I could care less how they come to that conclusion. I am not the curriculm. 2 is contrary to mainstream history, therefore I don't buy into it, and neither ought you.\n \n 3. Apparently they have information, since this isn't the only source which states the massive problem. It's also in the New International, Spielvogel's text, as well as Zinn's text. That's three academic college sources. I'm not going to disagree with them over the opinion of some guy on a webboard. They are good enough for Universities and the lecturers, they are good enough for me\n \n \n Now, you have effectively proven #3 is true. This is fine with me, though in the future, you may want to try to prove/push your own points, as oppossed to proving those of the opposition. I can argue my own points, I don't need any help.\n \n you have effectively done what the author of the referenced work did. You have formed an opinion despite the fact that there is no factual basis for it. You need to learn to think more critically, not just beleive whatever garbage happens to be in whatever textbook is popular at the time.\n\n \n The works are reliable sources from credible curriculums and academic sources. THey are completely valid, regardless of your opinion of them. YOu have no sources, and you failed to uphold your BoP, as mentioned on the logic sites. Its the prevelant historical information available. It's reliable according to the history field.\n \n In regards to the first point about proving #3, I don't mind providing you with information when I have the chance. However, I use historical resources that  are  credible and widely used. I do want the information available to come out, regardless of who's it is. It would be dishonest otherwise, don't you think?\n \n Secondly, you didn't argue your points about the 18th and 19th centuries, since you have no records of the time, as you admit, because \"census\" date of the time wasn't \"kept on it,\" as you say. This means it could or could not have been a problem, regardless of their lack of keeping a good record, if that were the case. Historical texts/journals disagree with you, so they most likley have another way of finding the information required. I provided the sources. \n \n You don't have to agree with the source, but that doesn't make your case. My job is done; I provided a source which countered your lack of any resources on the topic, despite the burden of proof belonging to you.\n \n All texts say the same thing, and most credible historians agree, therefore I am not going to disagree with them. It's unlikely they are wrong. That's critical enough. You must have a problem with History sources.\n \n \n Although Americans have long celebrated their nation's wealth\n and the abundance of its resources, poverty has been\n omnipresent in American history. From the colonial period to\n the present day, large numbers of Americans have been poor:\n they have lacked the resources to feed, clothe, and shelter\n themselves adequately according to socially defined standards.\n Just how many Americans have lived in poverty over the course\n of more than three centuries is impossible to gauge; not only are\n data scarce, but the definition of poverty has changed too often\n (and is too subject to debate) to permit precise measurement.\n Nonetheless, there can be no doubt that poverty, as a personal\n condition and as a social problem, has long been a prominent\n feature of the economic and social landscape.\n\n \n \n 1. The article describes data as scarce, but not non-existent. They obviously got them from somewhere else. Statistics aren't the only historical methods used. It's nOt my job in this discussion to find out where and to criticise mainstream historical sources. If there were a problem, the myriad researchers would have found it. This is like those people comming up with counters to evolution that they think are unique, as if the researchers of mainstream had not already taken care of that problem. THat's beyond the credible provided academic sources. I'll trust my peer reviewed journals and texts.\n \n Impossible is largely hyperbole, since it's not impossible due to the fact that they have rounded numbers, personal accounts of the period, primary documents, and collected, but scarce data from the periods.\n \n More sources which say the same thing about large-scale poverty.\n \n \n \n An inquiry into the cause of industrial depressions\n and of the increase of want with increase of wealth...\n The Remedy\n \n by Henry George\n\n \n \n Not everyone shared in the economic prosperity of this period. Many workers were typically unemployed at least part of the year, and their wages were relatively low when they did work. This situation led many workers to support and join labor unions. Meanwhile, farmers also faced hard times as technology and increasing production led to more competition and falling prices for farm products. Hard times on farms led many young people to move to the city in search of better job opportunities.\n\n \n http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/ndlpedu/features/timeline/riseind/riseof.html\n \n http://www.nv.cc.va.us/home/nvsageh/Hist122/Part1/CapitalandLabor.html\n \n Remember, I am not arguing with you on the idea that government is inefficent or that programs can be replaced. I am arguing that that not all programs ought to be replaced. Some should, and some should be reformed.\n The 19th and 18th century, however, were hardly wonderful anti-socialist paradises.\n \n SOcialism fixed many problems. \n \n \n In the 19th century no special concern existed over children or women doing hard work; they had always worked within the family on farms, etc. By 1890 18% of the labor force consisted of children between the ages of 10 and 15. A state of quasi slavery existed where parents bound children to working; child labor was not really addressed until the Progressive Era.\n\n \n \n  Industrial safety was a large issue: factory work was very dangerous, and it was difficult if not impossible to hold factory owners responsible for deaths and injuries.  Around 1900 25-35,000 deaths and 1 million injuries per year occurred on industrial jobs-many of them railroad jobs, which were very dangerous. Fires, machine accidents, wrecks, etc. were common There was no federal regulation of safety and no enforcement of safety regulations..  Insurance and pensions were rare\n\n \n \n In the 1850s the cost of living rose 12%, wages only 4%.\n\n \n The cost of living during the pre-socialist years was three times as high as the wages paid to the masse who made up 80% of the population.\n \n \n American cities in the last half of the last century could be seen in a sense as all things to all people: Farmers and residents of rural areas saw them as pits of degradation and corruption. Immigrants saw them as perhaps crowded and dirty but filled with opportunities for work, education and cultural stimulation. Poor working class people saw them as prisons, perhaps, or merely places where they could eke out an existence, living from day to day.\n\n \n This one can help you as well. As mentioned in an above article, prosperity is judged by those who experience the time. The wealthy upper class as well as the plutocracy thought wonders of the time, but the lower middle class, workers, and poor, did not, adn they made up the bulk of the population (75-80%).\n \n Amazingly, some prospered under such horrible hands off conditions.\n \n \n You mentioned earlier that churches and private charities could take care of the problem of poverty? That's not true 100%: In fact-- \n \n\n \n Settlement Houses. Coping with the problems of the cities, especially in poorer areas, was beyond the ability of city governments and of churches.\n\n \n Settlement houses started off as private, but they couldn't take on the responsibility needed to alleviate the massive suffering, so they gladly handed over the task to the fedreal government, who had far more ability. The government was needed, because the churches, the prisons, and the private charities were \"stocked.\"\n \n \n[/B] As reformer Henry George pointed out, the existence side by side of massive evidence of progress with appalling conditions of poverty is one of the paradoxes of the age.[B] Reform was essential, and it came in the form of the Progressive Movement.\n\n \n \n http://www.nv.cc.va.us/home/nvsageh/Hist122/Part1/WorkingMen.htm\n \n Personal accounts and primary sources of poverty wide-spread among the working and lower middle class.\n \n The same mass poverty is also described in detail by these two documentaries:\n \n 1. Heaven Will Protect the WOrking GIrl\n 2. 1877: The Grand Army of Starvation\n \n http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Econ_Articles/carnegie/DeLong_Moscow_paper2.html\n \n According to Berkely, the share of wealth in the 19th century fluctuated. In fact, during this hands off age, the top 1% of the nation held 40% of all the wealth. They think it finally peaked off at 45 around 1900.\n \n \n near-universal education boosted the productivity and wages of those near the bottom of the pyramid, progressive income and estate taxes trimmed some wealth off the top, and explicit government wage policy--minimum wages, restrictions on connections between finance and industry, and support for union-centered collective bargaining--shifted the distribution of income and wealth toward labor without producing mammoth amounts of classical unemployment\n\n \n Massive ammounts of classical unemployment prevented, yet it greatly improved the lot of million's of lives.\n \n \n The former was awarded the American Historical Association John E. O'Connor Film Award\n \n \n Do you know what kind of world it would be like if this never occured? Do you know how appalling society would be under a fully Libertarian system that existed prior to socialist policies (i am not just talking about big wasteful programs like the flawed social security and abused welfare)?\n \n Reform was essential in an area of ramant poverty for the majority of people, even though that poverty ran right along side the wealth and prosperity of a minority.\n \n \n I don't want today's society to go back to that.\n \n I want a Libertarian social atmosphere with limited government involvement, except for where it cannot be avoided without causing the same type of problems.\n \n We still need many of the socialist regulations, laws, etc, becaues they prevent the above.",

   "It's not just that source. It's corroborated by other books and peer reviewed journals. It's highly unlikely they just make it up. It's not my job to find out how they get the information, only that it's part of a legitimate academic source. Being part of a college curriculum means it's highly likely that it's accurate and worth something. \n\n \n And yet in A New Economic View of American history: From Colonial Times to 1940, Jeremy Atack Susan Lees and Peter Passell note:\n \n \nDespite the currently popular view that poverty was widespread in America from colonial times to the early 20th century, no evidence has been found to corroborate this. The majority of material suggesting this to be the case focuses on large port cities such as New York, Boston and Sacramento without taking into account the fact that the poverty levels in such cities was driven almost entirely by millions of new immigrants arriving every year from Europe primarily for the purpose of escaping poverty. \n \n Besides being illogical to believe that millions of emigrants seeking to escape poverty chose as their destination a country with a high poverty level, charitable records from the time do not support this viewpoint.\n \n The only extensive records from the period which address the issue are the records from charitable organizations. In analyzing the records from the 100 largest organizations, it becomes apparent that while the poverty level in New York and Boston may well have approached 25%, the poverty level in the united states as a whole was less than 2%\n\n \n \n If you are interested in poverty in early America, the book is a must have. Their methodology in regards to the question of poverty is interesting. They obtained the records from charitable organizations and used those to study the issue. In reality, I think that their methodology may be a little skewed to the high side, though, since they assume that everybody who sought assistance, or whom the organization identified as being eligible for aid, lived in poverty. \n \n One of the organizations they used was The YMCA, including information from the Boston YMCA. The boston YMCA had, as one if its services, A free clinic that treated 73,363 new patients in 1891 and dispensed 85,752 prescriptions. These patients are included in the poverty roster. I think it is unreasonable to assume that everybody who shows up at a free clinic is necessarily living in poverty. \n \n They also included estimations from the catholic church regarding poverty (since the catholic church was the biggest charitable organization in the US during the specified period). The catholic church considered anybody in America who did not have at least 1 room for every two people in their home and 3 changes of clothing for everybody in the household to be living in poverty. While today this would certainly be considered poverty, I think they set the bar a little high for the time. It seems to me that they did this to increase the numbers (since, as Atack and Pasall note, poverty was fairly rare) in order to solicit larger donations.\n \n \nSource was provided from an academic unit. That's enough, since it say sthe opposite, and textbooks in colleges as well as the journals on their databases are selected and reviewed.\n\n \n I remember being chastised by professors in college for not viewing things with a critiacl eye. Once in particular I was berated rather badly by an economics professor for simply repeating what I had read in a textbook. \n \n He said \"Mr Daewoo (nake changed to protect the innocent), does the text you just recited from give any numbers to support that statement, or explain the methodology they used to make the determination?\"\n \n \"no\"\n \n \"Does is provide any insight at all as to how the numbers were obtained, or any frame of reference as to how one might confirm those numbers?\"\n \n \"no\"\n \n \"Then how do you know that what you are reciting as fact is indeed fact?\"\n \n \"Well, it is in the textbook. Surely somebody has checked it.\"\n \n \"Mr Daewoo, I wrote that textbook. What you just recited as fact was my personal opinion at the time, and I can assure you that nobody checked it for accuracy, as it has since been proven to be incorrect. You are not going to go far in this world if you do not learn to view things with a critical eye.\"\n \n That was not an uncommon exchange when I was in college, so I admit that my view of what constitutues \"proof\" is slightly higer than \"Somebody wrote it in a textbook.\" If it does not include methodology, raw data, or even an explanation of how the \"fact\" was arrived at, it is not \"proof\".\n \n What I posted above is \"proof\". It makes a statement, explains the basis for that statement, clearly identifies the authors, and gives anough information about source that you could (if you felt so disposed and had the time available) check the vlaidity of it yourself. The book explains the full methodology used to arrive at the conclusions they have regarding poverty in early America, including Giving alist of over 200 charitable organization, the record of which are the basis for their conclusion. THAT, is credible evidence. \n \n If you need, I can put up the whole list of organizations they used, or thier section on methodology. They actually concluded that only about half of those eleigible for applied or asked for aid, and included the prmise in their final calculation, which I think probably skews them more towards the high end. This is common in the academic world, it makes it easier to defend your work.\n \n A quote that starts with \"we don't have the data to support this, but here is what we think\" is no \"credible evidence\".\n \n What has happened to College? It used ot be you memorized facts in high school, then in college they taught you to think. Now it seems that you memorize fact in high school, and in college they teach you to think like everybody else. No wonder college grads and college students have taken on so many charachteristics of mindless drones.\n \n \n \n1. I agreed with you on one, and I still do.\n\n \n Then whay did you ask me to prove it?\n \n \n2. THe second one I am correct, since all historical sources say the same, and I am only required to provide those sources. I could care less how they come to that conclusion. I am not the curriculm. 2 is contrary to mainstream history, therefore I don't buy into it, and neither ought you.\n\n \n And I have refuted your sources. Beyond that, I have questioned the credibility of them. The fact that they are the textbook your classes use does not make them \"credible\". You now need to either defend your sources or, if they cannot be defended, find new ones. In order for a source to be credible, at the very least methodology and data sources must be explained. As you are still a student, I doubt you know a whole lot about \"mainstream history\", though I would imagine that you know a lot about the curriculem at your school.\n \n David Horowitz has written a lot of stuff, most of it better written and better documented than what you have provided here. A lot of what he writes is easily disproven garbage, though. Bellisiles and Finkleman have also written a lot of stuff, again, most of it (especially bellisiles work) is much closer to \"credible source\" than what you have posted here. His Gun study cites data and explains methodology. Of course, when you look at his data and methodology you quickly discover that he is a fraud, but at least he provided it. As an interesting side note, before being exposed as a fraud and subsequently dismissed from his postion in disgrace, he collaborated on several textbooks, some of which are already being used to indoctorinate a new generation of wide eyed Americna college student to (apparently) accept things unquestioningly. \n \n I suspect that in the next 5 years we will have to disprove his work all over again, since so much of it already made it into textbooks. Yet another intelectual inbred saying \"It is a fact because it is in my textbooks, and THAT is mainstream history\".\n \n This is why you must always think critically and never accept \"facts\" just because they are in print. If they are not independantly verifiable, or their basis is not explained, they are questrionable at best. There are others out there. Like Bellisiles, working from a faulty or even fraudulent basis, who are right now collaborating on new textbooks. \n \n \n3. Apparently they have information, since this isn't the only source which states the massive problem. It's also in the New International, Spielvogel's text, as well as Zinn's text. That's three academic college sources. I'm not going to disagree with them over the opinion of some guy on a webboard. They are good enough for Universities and the lecturers, they are good enough for me\n\n \n As are the text books that Bellisiles collaborated on. Again, if no methodology is expalined, and no basis for the observation is explained, it is an opinion, not a fact, nor is it even a credible source. \n \n Besides, what you provided was opinions regarding #3, not #2. #2 focuses on the economic condition of the United states and whether or not it was conducive to poverty. This is not something you argue with regard to whether poverty existed, or whether poverty was a problem. It is strictly an economics question. What I am saying here is that generally economic conditions conducive to poverty include slow, flatline, or even negative economic growth, high levels of unemployment, low availability of industrial materials (raw materials for manufacture.....this requires that employers cut wages badly in order to cover the increased price of raw materials). \n \n I would even go so far as to include immigration numbers in this, since coutries that have a problem with poverty do not experience population growth due to immigration. Some do experience dometic population growth if there is a high level of infant mortality (since people have more children as theri odds of survival decrease), but immigration growth in nations with high rates of poverty is null.\n \n Since it is widely understood that American economic growth prior to the 20th century was phenomemnal, sometimes so large as to be damaging, and that this economic growth led to a job surplus, and that we saw a massive influx of emigrants during the time period, and that we had the cheapest raw materials on the planet at the time, would you like to just concede this point, and we can move forward to the question of how many people DID live in poverty, and the causes for that poverty?\n \n \n \nIn regards to the first point about proving #3, I don't mind providing you with information when I have the chance. However, I use historical resources that  are  credible and widely used. I do want the information available to come out, regardless of who's it is. It would be dishonest otherwise, don't you think?\n\n \n Still sounds an awful lot like you don't have any real data and are looking to use mine. It also sounds like maybe you are coming around, realising that \"historical resources\" which do not explain methodology, or even the most basic reasoning regarding their observations are questionable at best. Thre may be hope for the younger generation yet.\n \n \nSecondly, you didn't argue your points about the 18th and 19th centuries, since you have no records of the time, as you admit, because \"census\" date of the time wasn't \"kept on it,\" as you say. This means it could or could not have been a problem, regardless of their lack of keeping a good record, if that were the case. Historical texts/journals disagree with you, so they most likley have another way of finding the information required. I provided the sources. \n \n \n I base my argument on the baove cited work, as well as a dozen or so other tomes I have on my shelf that use a similar methodology. Studying poverty in the early part of Americas history has always been problematic due to lack of data availibility. Susan Lee developed the concept of using charitable organizations record to estimate the scale of the poverty problem in early America. Since then, at least a dozen historians have adopted it to one degree or another.\n \n Since other records are either horribly incomplete or entirely non existant, and the records of charitable organizations from the time are the only complete records regarding poverty that we have from that time period, the idea caught on fairly well. While there is only limited data that can be gleaned from the records in question, it is nearly inarguably more credible than other guesses regrading poverty at the time, since we already know that other methodologies are basing their opinion son either incomplete data or no data at all.\n \n \nYou don't have to agree with the source, but that doesn't make your case. My job is done; I provided a source which countered your lack of any resources on the topic, despite the burden of proof belonging to you.\n \n All texts say the same thing, and most credible historians agree, therefore I am not going to disagree with them. It's unlikely they are wrong. That's critical enough. You must have a problem with History sources.\n\n \n I have no problem with history sources, provided that they provide methodology and explain how they arrived at their conclusion. Otherwise it is just fluff, the opinion of the author.\n \n \n \n \n1. The article describes data as scarce, but not non-existent. They obviously got them from somewhere else. Statistics aren't the only historical methods used. It's nOt my job in this discussion to find out where and to criticise mainstream historical sources. If there were a problem, the myriad researchers would have found it. This is like those people comming up with counters to evolution that they think are unique, as if the researchers of mainstream had not already taken care of that problem. THat's beyond the credible provided academic sources. I'll trust my peer reviewed journals and texts.\n\n \n How many researcher do you really htink spend time checking the validity of textbooks? I know that one physics text used at MIT contains at least a half dozen glarign errors. It is common knowledge among students there. They have not ben corrected, though (since most text books are short run). Depending on how good your professor is, he MIGHT point out the errors. Some do not, though. I think this is kind of a test of who is actualyl a worthy pupil and who is not. If you don't catch the errors, and account for them, you almost certianly fail the course (since they are fundamental errors which increase in magnitude as the subject matter becomes more complex).\n \n Again, methodology, or at least basis for opinion, if you want it to be regarded as a credible source. This is why research still goes on. What revision is your text book on? I still have a coupel of text books on my shelf from the college days. On is a history text. It is on its 23rd revision. You really think that is because they were so right 23 times that they needed to update?\n \n If everything written about history in textbooks and journals was correct, there would be no research, since we already know everything (especially in regards to history, since it has already happened). \n \n If it makes you feel any better, I once held the same misconception as you about poverty in our nations history. It was not until I started studying economics that I stopped and went \"Hey, wait a minute, why would we have such high poverty in an economy like THAT. Even the bad years were better than anything we have seen in the last 50 years\".\n \n I was then that I started taking a serious look at the history materials I had read on the subject (at the time, I,lie you, was a wide eyed socio fascist with little or no understanding of how the world actually worked, and my views were based largely on the mainly liberal leanings of my soft science professors (literature, history, etc...).\n \n As you delve a little deeper into your sources, you will likey find that most of the opinions expressed are based on 3 main sources:\n \n 1-firsthand obswervations of the living conditions of the poor, but without taking into account that such firsthand observations invariably center on the worst conditions the author could find to describe\n 2-Limited data available from New York, Boston, and other port cities, but without taking into account the masisve number of poor emigrants who arriving daily (which really does beg the question, why were so many people coming ot America if it was indeed the land of squalid poverty?)\n 3- Pure conjecture on the part of the author.\n \n Those were the 3 identifible \"sources\" I found when I looked at the same question (that was the beginning of realization for me that an agenda was beig pushed, and not one based in intelligent thought).\n \n \nImpossible is largely hyperbole, since it's not impossible due to the fact that they have rounded numbers, personal accounts of the period, primary documents, and collected, but scarce data from the periods.\n\n \n So, where did those rounded numbers come from? Vauge numbers ore often the result of no data, an idnicator that you are flying on faith. \n \n \nAn inquiry into the cause of industrial depressions\n and of the increase of want with increase of wealth...\n The Remedy\n \n by Henry George \n \n \n \n \n Quote:\n Not everyone shared in the economic prosperity of this period. Many workers were typically unemployed at least part of the year, and their wages were relatively low when they did work. This situation led many workers to support and join labor unions. Meanwhile, farmers also faced hard times as technology and increasing production led to more competition and falling prices for farm products. Hard times on farms led many young people to move to the city in search of better job opportunities \n \n \n This has nothing to do with poverty. It says that small farms saw hard time (gee, really....) and that wages were relatively low. That is a no brainer as well. Small farmers are STILL having a rough time, and technology and increasing production are STILL driving the cost of farm goods down. That same technology also provided for greater output for the farms with less labor requirement.\n \n Today, children are still being driven off the farm and to the city to find jobs. In fact, this has increased. A family farm cannot justify keeping 4 kids around to do the work of one man. at one time, 80 acres was about all 2 men could handle. Now 80 acres is nothing. We have combines that cut a 25 ft swath and can effectively harvest at over 30 miles per hour. \n \n \nIn the 19th century no special concern existed over children or women doing hard work; they had always worked within the family on farms, etc. By 1890 18% of the labor force consisted of children between the ages of 10 and 15. A state of quasi slavery existed where parents bound children to working; child labor was not really addressed until the Progressive Era. \n \n Quote:\n Industrial safety was a large issue: factory work was very dangerous, and it was difficult if not impossible to hold factory owners responsible for deaths and injuries. Around 1900 25-35,000 deaths and 1 million injuries per year occurred on industrial jobs-many of them railroad jobs, which were very dangerous. Fires, machine accidents, wrecks, etc. were common There was no federal regulation of safety and no enforcement of safety regulations.. Insurance and pensions were rare \n \n \n Here you are talking cultural differences between then and now. Prior to the technologialc farming revolution, kids stayed on their families farms for life, working along side dear old dad, and peopel knocked them out like it was going out of style due to lack of birth control and the need for labor on the farm\n \n During the early part of the 20th century, the leading cause of death in industrial accidents was boiler explosions. A boiler is an expensive piece of equipment. Do you really think that the factory owners were failing to maintain them in the safest manner possible (since a boiler explosion is about all that really happens with a boiler than kills people)? Metallurical advances led to better and safer boilers, which benifitted everybody.\n \n Technology made for a safer workplace. While I would certainly agree that government regulation has likely saved some lives, I think to give them too much credit is a farce. \n \n \n \n \nThe cost of living during the pre-socialist years was three times as high as the wages paid to the masse who made up 80% of the population.\n\n \n The provided data does not fit that statement. Here is the snippet you provided:\n \n \nIn the 1850s the cost of living rose 12%, wages only 4%. \n \n \n That is a 12% INCREASE in the cost of living, and a 4% INCREASE in wages. That does not at all supprot the statement that the cost of living was 4 times as high as the wages provided, which is an idiotic and impossible statement. \n \n If you look at modern numbers that INCLUDE food and energy, which are generally excluded form COL calcualtions and inflationary calcualtions (I can only assume to keep from scaring the general public, since food and energy to heat your home when it is 2 degrees outside should certianly be considered part of the cost of living), we are doing worse today. Last year, real cost of living went up 8% and real wages went up less than 2%. If you include inflationary calcualtions (weakeneing dollar), the number is horrifying (the dolalr dropped 19% against other major currencies in 2003, and 15% in 2004)\n \n I am not sure why they don't include energy costs and food in these numbers, since they are certainly the basis of our economy. Even housing costs are not included in most COL calcualtions anymore (though they used to be). Again, I can only assume this is to keep the public complacent. Even juicy government COLA programs have not kept up with RCOL. \n \n This one can help you as well. As mentioned in an above article, prosperity is judged by those who experience the time. The wealthy upper class as well as the plutocracy thought wonders of the time, but the lower middle class, workers, and poor, did not, adn they made up the bulk of the population (75-80%).\n \n \nhttp://www.nv.cc.va.us/home/nvsageh/Hist122/Part1/WorkingMen.htm\n \n Personal accounts and primary sources of poverty wide-spread among the working and lower middle class.\n\n \n From the text:\n \n \nIn the fifteen years I have worked as a miner I have earned the average rate of wages any of us coal heavers get. To-day I am little better off than when I started to do for myself. I have $100 on hand; I am not in debt; I hope to be able to weather the strike without going hungry. \n \n \n WOW, money on hand and NO DEBT. Considering the Average American has a NEGATIVE net worth today, most can only aspire to be as fortunate as this poor person. \n \n again, these are worthless as indicators of how wide spread poverty truly was, or what the average living condition for those in poverty are, since such accounts tend to focus on the most morbid conditions one could find in an attempt to highlight the point they are trying to convey.\n \n This is like looking at descriptions of the squalor of East St Louis and saying \"that is what America as a whole is like\".\n \n Read teh account of the chinese laundryman. He started out making $3.50 per week, but SAVED $3 of it, then got a raise to $5 per week, and SAVED $4.25. After 2 years of working a menial job, he had saved enoguh moeney to start a business. \n \n This is the kind of escape from pverty I was talking about, as well as a good example of why I think poverty was largely considered a temporary situation. In a strong, growing economy, anybody who is willing to work, and work hard, is able to get ahead. \n \n How long do you think you would have to work at Mc donalds today before you saved up enough cash to start your own business?\n \n I appreciate the latest effort to prove my points for me, but again, the idea here is for you to disprove my points, not prove them",

   " \n I remember being chastised by professors in college for not viewing things with a critiacl eye. Once in particular I was berated rather badly by an economics professor for simply repeating what I had read in a textbook.\n \n He said \"Mr Daewoo (nake changed to protect the innocent), does the text you just recited from give any numbers to support that statement, or explain the methodology they used to make the determination?\"\n \n \"no\"\n \n \"Does is provide any insight at all as to how the numbers were obtained, or any frame of reference as to how one might confirm those numbers?\"\n \n \"no\"\n \n \"Then how do you know that what you are reciting as fact is indeed fact?\"\n \n \"Well, it is in the textbook. Surely somebody has checked it.\"\n\n \n \n \n\n \"Mr Daewoo, I wrote that textbook. What you just recited as fact was my personal opinion at the time, and I can assure you that nobody checked it for accuracy, as it has since been proven to be incorrect. You are not going to go far in this world if you do not learn to view things with a critical eye.\"\n \n\n \n How is anyone suppposed to valid this claim? This is anecdotal evidence.\n Does anyone here know this professor or if he really existed? My professors are vastly different. THey want you to use academic texts, literature, journals of history. None of them provide the \"level\" of proof you want. \n \n \n\n That was not an uncommon exchange when I was in college, so I admit that my view of what constitutues \"proof\" is slightly higer than \"Somebody wrote it in a textbook.\" If it does not include methodology, raw data, or even an explanation of how the \"fact\" was arrived at, it is not \"proof\".\n\n \n I don't follow any person who write a textbook. I look at the degree, where he went to college, what his political affiliation is, what instituations use the book, and if it's mainstream or not. I don't go to borders and pick out one of the 9 billion history books they have.\n \n Most, if not all of my sources came from high level history courses and peer journals. They are widely-used for academic writing and comentary. I don't know what you want, since that's what's available from the 18th and 19th century, and it paints a vastly different picture from what you are describing.\n \n I agree with you. It's important to look at sources, but i trust the primary and mainstream sources that have come to these conclusions over time. Difference in the way you do stuff, i guess. I am not an original researcher. I only go by the primary and secondary sources. Where raw data and statistics are provided, I go by them, but in much of history, that's not the case. I can't fix the history curriculum.\n \n You are free to read any book, author, article I posted as well from the search premiers. I trust academic sources. There's no point in arguing anything if you don't trust the sources.\n \n For example, I was at another forum arguing with a White Supremecist, and no matter how much evidence I showed him from the AAA, AAA, APA, AHS, none of it was his \"level\" of proof. Of course, the NARTH organization was a credible source, according to him.\n \n I have grown skeptical about people doubting mainstream because of this. People have impossible standards of truth that they keep chaning to avoid a situation.\n \n I am sure the 19th century benefited millions of people, and in fact, most of the sources say they did, but many also didn't. \n \n \n\n What I posted above is \"proof\". It makes a statement, explains the basis for that statement, clearly identifies the authors, and gives anough information about source that you could (if you felt so disposed and had the time available) check the vlaidity of it yourself. The book explains the full methodology used to arrive at the conclusions they have regarding poverty in early America, including Giving alist of over 200 charitable organization, the record of which are the basis for their conclusion. THAT, is credible evidence.\n \n\n \n And myriad college texts from advanced-level courses and peer reviewed journals don't constitute evidence? I think they do, and so does mainstream. There are few Fringe historians who disagree. They are free to do so. I am not saying you are stupid because of it.\n \n \n \n\n A quote that starts with \"we don't have the data to support this, but here is what we think\" is no \"credible evidence\".\n \n\n \n That was only one source, and it didn't come from a Text. The texts primarily \n \n \n\n What has happened to College? It used ot be you memorized facts in high school, then in college they taught you to think. Now it seems that you memorize fact in high school, and in college they teach you to think like everybody else. No wonder college grads and college students have taken on so many charachteristics of mindless drones.\n\n \n Critial thinking in college basically consists of looking for academic sources that are deemed reliable but the institutions when you are an undergraduate. When you go to post-graduate, they want you to do more original research and come up with new ideas.\n \n I had professors, opposite those that you have, that only wanted you to use what they deemed as reliable sourdes--mainstream. There's no point in paying 700 dollars for textbooks and database access if you can't use them.\n \n Would you think that's sane?\n \n \n \n If everything written about history in textbooks and journals was correct, there would be no research, since we already know everything (especially in regards to history, since it has already happened).\n \n If it makes you feel any better, I once held the same misconception as you about poverty in our nations history. It was not until I started studying economics that I stopped and went \"Hey, wait a minute, why would we have such high poverty in an economy like THAT. Even the bad years were better than anything we have seen in the last 50 years\".\n \n I was then that I started taking a serious look at the history materials I had read on the subject (at the time, I,lie you, was a wide eyed socio fascist with little or no understanding of how the world actually worked, and my views were based largely on the mainly liberal leanings of my soft science professors (literature, history, etc...).\n \n As you delve a little deeper into your sources, you will likey find that most of the opinions expressed are based on 3 main sources:\n \n 1-firsthand obswervations of the living conditions of the poor, but without taking into account that such firsthand observations invariably center on the worst conditions the author could find to describe\n 2-Limited data available from New York, Boston, and other port cities, but without taking into account the masisve number of poor emigrants who arriving daily (which really does beg the question, why were so many people coming ot America if it was indeed the land of squalid poverty?)\n 3- Pure conjecture on the part of the author.\n \n Those were the 3 identifible \"sources\" I found when I looked at the same question (that was the beginning of realization for me that an agenda was beig pushed, and not one based in intelligent thought).\n \n\n \n Well, the most common belief why many people came to america is because the poverty of europe was worse than America, but that doesn't mean that it was wonderful.\n \n The poverty problem was also hidden. Communication wasn't fast or reliable for many people, and America was propagandized as the land of opportunity where you could use social stratification to your advantage.\n \n \n I was then that I started taking a serious look at the history materials I had read on the subject (at the time, I,like you, was a wide eyed socio fascist with little or no understanding of how the world actually worked, and my views were based largely on the mainly liberal leanings of my soft science professors (literature, history, etc...).\n\n \n I am not a socialist or a Fascist. I support neither. I support liberal social behavior as long as you aren't threatening or doing property damage potential. I support many libertarian programs, but I don't like the Randian Objectivst thinking that dominates it: THe virtue of selfishness. As for my social stance: I am largely a classical liberal. I think the government should stay out of your private lives. On the other hand, I think the government should attempt to do positive good in public sectors and provide for the people no one else will help. \n \n I support SOME socialist programs, because not all are bad. I want to keep min wage laws, factory laws. I want limited aid packages. THere's a difference between a wacko-socialist and a mild socialist. If you can fix the poverty problem: reALLY fix it, and not having millions have no healthcare, no adequate living conditions, that's fine. As it stands now, how many people don't have healthcare? Is it like 10 million children? Should the government do nothing?\n \n What will happen when you get rid of any type of welfare and charities cannot (and won't) magically fill the void? Are people going to die? Even if the economy is running efficienty, which Libertarianism tries to do, there will be hundreds of thousands of people who will regardlessly live in poverty. It's not human nature to change and become productive if they aren't. Humans are inherently lazy as a species.\n \n I think Libertarian ideals need to be mixed some other ethical principles, not totally subverted.\n \n I don't think politicians should pork barrel either, but I am for programs that alleviate suffering. I don't want wealth equalization or government domination of resources and capital. SO how do you say I am a fascist or Socialist? Are you a christian because you support (perhaps) some christian ideals? Some ideology does not a socialist make.\n \n I see a problem with pie in the sky socialism that wants to fully redistribute wealth and make everything egalitarian--it's not even utilitarian.\n \n \n \n \n This has nothing to do with poverty. It says that small farms saw hard time (gee, really....) and that wages were relatively low. That is a no brainer as well. Small farmers are STILL having a rough time, and technology and increasing production are STILL driving the cost of farm goods down. That same technology also provided for greater output for the farms with less labor requirement.\n \n Today, children are still being driven off the farm and to the city to find jobs. In fact, this has increased. A family farm cannot justify keeping 4 kids around to do the work of one man. at one time, 80 acres was about all 2 men could handle. Now 80 acres is nothing. We have combines that cut a 25 ft swath and can effectively harvest at over 30 miles per hour.\n \n\n \n So ridiculously low labour wages didn't contribute to the problem? How did they get higher wages? Not from Libertarianism, but from mild social policies and regulations. The farms really aren't the concern. It's the city dwellers. Farmers can be expected to decline. It's the wage and conditions of workers and middleclass.\n \n \n \n WOW, money on hand and NO DEBT. Considering the Average American has a NEGATIVE net worth today, most can only aspire to be as fortunate as this poor person.\n\n \n Really, we would be fortunate to not barely be able to get food? Most americans have a high standard of living today compared to that of the 19th century.\n \n \n\n again, these are worthless as indicators of how wide spread poverty truly was, or what the average living condition for those in poverty are, since such accounts tend to focus on the most morbid conditions one could find in an attempt to highlight the point they are trying to convey.\n \n This is like looking at descriptions of the squalor of East St Louis and saying \"that is what America as a whole is like\".\n\n \n It's considered that conditions in the cities that were selected aren't different from other urban cities. IT's doubtful they are.\n \n \n\n Read teh account of the chinese laundryman. He started out making $3.50 per week, but SAVED $3 of it, then got a raise to $5 per week, and SAVED $4.25. After 2 years of working a menial job, he had saved enoguh moeney to start a business.\n\n \n Oh i did read this. It's an exceptional story, but it doesn't reflect the majority. Entreprenurial ability is one of the 5 major scarce resources in Economics. Not everyone has this ability. If they don't, should they die and their families starve?\n \n This is the kind of escape from pverty I was talking about, as well as a good example of why I think poverty was largely considered a temporary situation. In a strong, growing economy, anybody who is willing to work, and work hard, is able to get ahead.\n \n How long do you think you would have to work at Mc donalds today before you saved up enough cash to start your own business?\n \n I appreciate the latest effort to prove my points for me, but again, the idea here is for you to disprove my points, not prove them[/quote]\n \n He has a measly 100 dollars and hopes not to go hungry, which is a problem no one should have to deal with realisticially. YOu ought not have to worry if you are going to get your next meal or starve to death. YOu shouldn't have to have wages which are so low that you can barely feed your family.\n \n \n \n That is a 12% INCREASE in the cost of living, and a 4% INCREASE in wages. That does not at all supprot the statement that the cost of living was 4 times as high as the wages provided, which is an idiotic and impossible statement.\n \n \n If you look at modern numbers that INCLUDE food and energy, which are generally excluded form COL calcualtions and inflationary calcualtions (I can only assume to keep from scaring the general public, since food and energy to heat your home when it is 2 degrees outside should certianly be considered part of the cost of living), we are doing worse today. Last year, real cost of living went up 8% and real wages went up less than 2%. If you include inflationary calcualtions (weakeneing dollar), the number is horrifying (the dolalr dropped 19% against other major currencies in 2003, and 15% in 2004)\n \n\n \n THe problem is now there are actual min. wage laws and wages are fairly good enough to survive for the majority of people. Then, they were not so lucky. If you do falter, there are also government programs that can help you. THen, you only had your local church or benevolent people to beg up. \n \n Now, the situation is getting worse as time goes on, yes. Poverty moves in shifts depending on certain policies and external influences. \n \n I am not sure why they don't include energy costs and food in these numbers, since they are certainly the basis of our economy. Even housing costs are not included in most COL calcualtions anymore (though they used to be). Again, I can only assume this is to keep the public complacent. Even juicy government COLA programs have not kept up with RCOL.\n \n This one can help you as well. As mentioned in an above article, prosperity is judged by those who experience the time. The wealthy upper class as well as the plutocracy thought wonders of the time, but the lower middle class, workers, and poor, did not, adn they made up the bulk of the population (75-80%).\n [/quote]\n \n I never ment that the wages were 4 times lower. I miswrote that. What I meant was that the level of cost of living rose 4 x the ammount of the wages raising. It was bad then, and today's situation is bad too, but at least now wages are more in sync with costs, but that's changing. Back then, the wages were already already very low, as was the typical standard of acceptible living, especially for unskilled labour and low middleclass artisans etc.",

You check on all the other, but never bother to consider whther you are being presented with facts or not?\n \n \nMost, if not all of my sources came from high level history courses and peer journals.

I don't know what you want, since that's what's available from the 18th and 19th century, and it paints a vastly different picture from what you are describing.\n\n \n I want something that explains how they came to the conclusion that poverty was a serious problem in early America, since there seems to be no actual evidence of this. In fact, the data we do have (economic data, data from charitable institutions, and even many of the first had reports you cited) paint a radically different picture. If you want to present this stuff as a credible source, it needs to explain why the conclusions drawn are direct opposites to the fact at hand. \n \n Over 20 million immigrants entered the united states during that time period. If nothing awaited them but poverty and destitution, why did they come? There was plenty of poverty and destitution in Europe for them to enjoy. I have trouble believing that these 20 million people, who were there at the time, misunderstood the poverty situation in America, but the handful of authors and textbooks you have cited properly assesed the situation a hundred years later with no conclusive data available. \n \n If even one of them would explain the basis for this conclusion, it might bear consideration. As is, there are no facts presented, nor is there even a basis for the conclusion presented. \n \n \n \nI agree with you. It's important to look at sources, but i trust the primary and mainstream sources that have come to these conclusions over time. Difference in the way you do stuff, i guess. I am not an original researcher. I only go by the primary and secondary sources. Where raw data and statistics are provided, I go by them, but in much of history, that's not the case. I can't fix the history curriculum.\n\n \n A primary source is either a frist hand source or one dealing with raw data. You have presented none. The mainstream comes and goes, except that which is rooted in solid facts. \n \n \nYou are free to read any book, author, article I posted as well from the search premiers. I trust academic sources. There's no point in arguing anything if you don't trust the sources.\n\n \n Of course I am not going to trust sources that go entirely against available evidence and fail to offer even a glimmer of an explanation as to why their conclusions differe som radically form the available facts. That would be foolish (and you might remember this in your studies). \n \n \nI have grown skeptical about people doubting mainstream because of this. People have impossible standards of truth that they keep chaning to avoid a situation.\n\n \n My standards of proof are far from impossible, and for many years were the academic standard (I was unaware that this had changed). I want either facts, or at the bare minimum an explanation regarding how a conclusionw as drawn. Thats it. It is pretty simple. Facts are backed by numbers or other compelling evidence. What has been presented here as \"fact\" is little more than blind conjecture.\n \n \n \nAnd myriad college texts from advanced-level courses and peer reviewed journals don't constitute evidence? I think they do, and so does mainstream. There are few Fringe historians who disagree. They are free to do so. I am not saying you are stupid because of it.\n\n \n It depends. Do the peer reviewed articles include facts? Do they include information regarding how the conclusions were drawn? If so, they likely constitute evidence. If not, they are little more than non factual fluff, not worthy of consideration.\n \n Again, what is \"mainstream\" comes and goes. It is a word very nearly without meaning. As a historian, you should know this, and should know better than to consider whether a source is \"mainstream\" or not when choosing sources. Your \"mainstream\" sources proesent no facts or even a compelling argumet to support their claims. My \"non mainstream\" source provides facts which are backed up by numebrs and a sound methodology. \n \n While sticking to \"mainstream\" sources certainly assures that you will not be in teh uncomfortable position of being different, or having to think for yourself, in some situations it may not be the best idea. \n \n Currently the \"mainstream\" says that we have a good, growing economy. I, having a calculator and knowing how to use it, did my own calculations and made a lot of money last year investing based on the premise of a failing economy. That is the difference between a fact based assesment and a non factual one. \n \n \n \nCritial thinking in college basically consists of looking for academic sources that are deemed reliable but the institutions when you are an undergraduate. When you go to post-graduate, they want you to do more original research and come up with new ideas.\n \n I had professors, opposite those that you have, that only wanted you to use what they deemed as reliable sourdes--mainstream. There's no point in paying 700 dollars for textbooks and database access if you can't use them.\n \n Would you think that's sane?\n\n \n That is just sad, though it does explain the inability of most college grads to think outside the box, as well as explaining why those who can fetch a premium on the job market. It also explains why so many Americans live trapped int he lower and middle calss and never manage to break into a financial position beyond basic survival with few luxuries. You do not really get ahead thinking like everybody else. \n \n Come to think of it, it may also expalin the yuppie phenomenon in America, and why so many Americans dream includes a cookie cutter house with pasteboard siding and a non descript japanese car in the driveway.\n \n It CERTAINLY explains the socialist leanings of so many Americans, despite the historic evidence that such a system invariably ends in a failed economy. The un substantiated \"facts\" you are presented here were mostly written by folks from the previous generation, folks who went to college in the 60;s and 70's when the fashionable thing was for young college students to be socialists and communists. Considering the liberal leaninga of most folks who opt to become teachers or professors, it is unsurprising that the textbooks present a liberal viewpoint (you can almost always pick out the liberal viewpoint, since it is almost always teh one not supprted by facts or real numbers). \n \n The question is, if you grow up and become a history professor and end up collaborating on a textbook, will you be repeating these same unsubstantiated opinions as facts? OF course, by then history will likely have re-written itself even further. Of course, with the current state of our economy, and the likely direction it will be taking in the future, by the time you are old enough to be writing textbooks, academic types will be so busy trying to figure out a way to blame the economic crash on capitolism, depsite the fact that all indicators point the opposite direction.",

   "Well, the most common belief why many people came to america is because the poverty of europe was worse than America, but that doesn't mean that it was wonderful.\n \n \n Certainly not. You had to work for a living. \n \n \nThe poverty problem was also hidden. Communication wasn't fast or reliable for many people, and America was propagandized as the land of opportunity where you could use social stratification to your advantage.\n\n \n So millions of people were completely duped by a marketing scam, in an age where there was no mass media? You could work hard and get ahead, which was little more than a pipe dream in the rest of the world.\n \n \n \nI support SOME socialist programs, because not all are bad. I want to keep min wage laws, factory laws. I want limited aid packages. THere's a difference between a wacko-socialist and a mild socialist. If you can fix the poverty problem: reALLY fix it, and not having millions have no healthcare, no adequate living conditions, that's fine. As it stands now, how many people don't have healthcare? Is it like 10 million children? Should the government do nothing?\n\n \n Only 11.4% of children did not have health insurance in 2003, according to the census bureau (http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/hlthins/hlthins.html). That is 8.4 million children, and over half of them are eligible for insurance but not enrolled. \n \n So....what....we provide health insurance for everybody at an inflated cost? I have a better idea, one that has actually not been shown historically to be an utter failure. How about if we cut those programs alltogether, lower taxes, and let people buy their own insurance?\n \n \nWhat will happen when you get rid of any type of welfare and charities cannot (and won't) magically fill the void? Are people going to die? Even if the economy is running efficienty, which Libertarianism tries to do, there will be hundreds of thousands of people who will regardlessly live in poverty. It's not human nature to change and become productive if they aren't. Humans are inherently lazy as a species.\n\n \n I am certianly not against all social programs. I have stated here before, in this very thread, that I am all for engouh social programs to keep the poor contained and compalcent enough to not riot. Beyond that, I don't think we should be prividing them anything. YES, some will die. Regardless of what you do, some will always die. It is inevitable. Always has been, always will be. To push for a 0 death rate is entirely unrealistic. \n \n \n \nI don't think politicians should pork barrel either, but I am for programs that alleviate suffering. I don't want wealth equalization or government domination of resources and capital. SO how do you say I am a fascist or Socialist? Are you a christian because you support (perhaps) some christian ideals? Some ideology does not a socialist make.\n\n \n We already have government domination of resources and capitol. It is not so much your economic views that make you a socialist or a fascist as much as your other views. you seem to be all for a state that is \"like a parent\", which is how the fascist state was described by Mussolini. Socialist prefer to call it \"big brother\". but the concept is the same.\n \n \n \nSo ridiculously low labour wages didn't contribute to the problem? How did they get higher wages? Not from Libertarianism, but from mild social policies and regulations. The farms really aren't the concern. It's the city dwellers. Farmers can be expected to decline. It's the wage and conditions of workers and middleclass.\n\n \n No, not really, especially since farm production is not tied to labor rates (in fact, if you look at economic reports \"non farm\" wages are a seperate calssification). They got higher wages due to increased labor demand.\n \n \n \nReally, we would be fortunate to not barely be able to get food? Most americans have a high standard of living today compared to that of the 19th century.\n\n \n Barely be able to get food? On the same page there is an account by a chinese gentleman that claimed he made $3.50 a week and saved $3. This guy had $100 stacked away and no debt. That was likely 6 months pay. How many Americans do you think have 6 months pay in the bank and no debt? \n \n This guy was a miner, relatively unskilled labor, who had $100 at a time when $200 would buy you a farm with a house. How many unskilled laborers do you know to day that can make such a claim?\n \n \n \nIt's considered that conditions in the cities that were selected aren't different from other urban cities. IT's doubtful they are.\n\n \n So, authors are radically different today than they were back then? I mean, if you choose to write abotu poverty, you choose cases that best illustrate your point. Come on.\n \n \nOh i did read this. It's an exceptional story, but it doesn't reflect the majority. Entreprenurial ability is one of the 5 major scarce resources in Economics. Not everyone has this ability. If they don't, should they die and their families starve?\n\n \n The guy washed laundry by hand. YES, anybody can do that. If your premise was correct, why is it that even in 1900 the US had the higest standard of living in the world? If it was a question of entrepenurial ability (whihc I agree is rare), the majority of peopel would have been starving, which would likely have removed us from that particualr list alltogether.\n \n That is the point. In a healthy, growing economy, you do not have to posess incredible amounts of skill to get ahead, you simply have to be willing to show up and do your job.\n \n \nHe has a measly 100 dollars and hopes not to go hungry, which is a problem no one should have to deal with realisticially. YOu ought not have to worry if you are going to get your next meal or starve to death. YOu shouldn't have to have wages which are so low that you can barely feed your family.\n\n \n So, do you think he was worried about starvign becuase he was poor, or because he was a cola miner, which implies a remote location, and food simply became scarce in the winter due to the fact that game is harder to come by and winter transportation is unreliable at best, and the ability to store fresh produce was virtually non existant? \n \n Keep in mind that at the turn of the century a penny would get you 2 loaves of bread.\n \n \nTHe problem is now there are actual min. wage laws and wages are fairly good enough to survive for the majority of people. Then, they were not so lucky. If you do falter, there are also government programs that can help you. THen, you only had your local church or benevolent people to beg up. \n \n Now, the situation is getting worse as time goes on, yes. Poverty moves in shifts depending on certain policies and external influences. \n \n \n Until recent years and the boom in professional welfare recipients, poverty has always been traced directly to economic factors. In a growing economy, wiht a low rate of unemployment, poverty was traditionally slight and temporary. With the social programs we have in place, poverty does not change much regardless of economic circumstance becuase there is no incintive for people to go to work./\n \n In addition, massive socail programs have alwyas, without fail, in every situation where they have been tried, proved to be such a drain on the economy that it withered, causing more poverty. \n \n \n \nI never ment that the wages were 4 times lower. I miswrote that. What I meant was that the level of cost of living rose 4 x the ammount of the wages raising. It was bad then, and today's situation is bad too, but at least now wages are more in sync with costs, but that's changing. Back then, the wages were already already very low, as was the typical standard of acceptible living, especially for unskilled labour and low middleclass artisans etc.\n\n \n the wage was not \"very low\". There is this thing called \"inflation\". A dollar used to be a considerable sum of money. Pennies used to actually buy something. \n \n It is incredibly rare for cost of living to NOT rise faster than wages in the US. You will have about 25 years of incresaes in the cost of living without equal increses in the average wage, and then about a 5 yr cycle where the cost of living is heavily overshadowed by wage increases. It has always been this way. A 12% cost of living increase with a 4% wage increase is not remarkable or even bad.",

   "Currently the \"mainstream\" says that we have a good, growing economy. I, having a calculator and knowing how to use it, did my own calculations and made a lot of money last year investing based on the premise of a failing economy. That is the difference between a fact based assesment and a non factual one. \n \n That is just sad, though it does explain the inability of most college grads to think outside the box, as well as explaining why those who can fetch a premium on the job market. It also explains why so many Americans live trapped int he lower and middle calss and never manage to break into a financial position beyond basic survival with few luxuries. You do not really get ahead thinking like everybody else. \n \n\n \n Other than on a consulting basis I left the corporate world 15-years ago. At that time we were requiring a grad degree (not in internal or published HR data) from primarily private schools as the public schools had turned to MBA programs for revenue sources. They were churning out primarily liberal arts types who thought they'd make big money in business with a quick program by stuffing them with theory bearing little resemblance to the real world. Needless to say, most were absolutely lost when faced with making even feeble attempts to understand structured circumstances and how problems were remedied. \n \n Most of us understood at that time the rumors of deteriorating education were indeed a fact; former high school knowledge levels were being pushed up to the undergrad level. The ability of many people able to think on their feet was being reduced to those who were obviously capable, and they were becoming few and far between. We were receiving human robots full of programming errors as America attempted to force all students into believing a college education would be their salvation.\n \n Business could easily see the American gravy train slowing down, anyone who didn't understand it with Regan's tax cuts had to be a shining example of the Peter Principle. The politicians knew at the same time, and education became a great horse to ride. Federal student loans made it a very controllable situation, allowing the powerful federal bureacracy to make all rules. Let them learn by questionable rote makes numbers. They either pass or fail a bar set by whatever text books they use. \n \n At a certain point capacity became a problem. That's pretty easy to sort out, the fed began applying qualifiers on how applicants would be accepted. Equal rights based on every rationale from poverty to race was employed in a desperate effort to spend money, public funds, to divert what was eventually going to become a two tiered social system out of economic circumstances from reality. \n \n Now that an undergrad degree in anything is well on the way to becoming a requirement for fast food counter employment, most of America is adjusting to what will be a lower standard of living for many folks. So what's the political difference if they're kept occupied with what they're being told will be their intellectual and economic saving grace or telling them that they're not getting a useful education? They eventually inherit what's left. Hopefully, most have good trusts to fall back on.",

We were receiving human robots full of programming errors as America attempted to force all students into believing a college education would be their salvation.\n\n \n If the burden of evidence in academic work has fallen as low as Tigerlilly has indicated, \"deteriorating\" may well be an understatement. I think we have all long been aware of the decline in the quality of education for a purely curriculum driven standpoint. When businesses started hiring college grads for positions that traditionally did not require one simply so they could insure that the applicant could read and perform arithmetic at an 8th grade level, that should have clued most into the declining standard as far as bulk of knowledge obtained goes.\n \n I was unaware that the definition of \"fact\" had changed from an academic standpoint from something that could be proven to merely something that has been written. It would appear from the recent conversation that the current crop of students is so well indoctrinated in the new order of things that they fail to grasp the circular logic involved.

It seems that the new educational system is certain to prove to be useful in the future, since it is likely to include massive poverty and a two tier socail system. Teaching them not to think, to shut up and believe what they are told to believe certainly has its benifits if you are the guy in charge of keeping the unwashed masses in the gutter where they belong.\n \n We may very well find that our modern system of higer education is neraly as useful as christianity for keeping the poor in their place.",

And you don't want to know what it costs to pursue a trademark or patent infringement action. This is about money, nothing else.\n\n \n This is why I asked. \n \n A good friend of mine from high school developed an idea for a product in the machine tool industry. When he started out, we were manufaturing it for him on a fairly small scale using our excess capacity. He grew beyond waht we could provide (mine is basically a prototyping and short run production company, we are not set up for large scale production) and switched to a custom manufacturing company, American based, for supply.\n \n Roughly 6 months into the venture, he was approached by a representative of a chinese company who announced that they planned to manufacture an identical item. He basically blackmailed the guy. He was given the choice of either purchasing the units from the chinese company, or being driven out of business by the competition (since the chinese companies wholesale price for the item at about half the price that he was paying his manufaturer). \n \n The representative had all the research needed to make an informed decision. He had sales estimates, supply channel details, and even itemised estimates of what it would cost to defend the patent should my buddy make a foolish choice (their estimate was in the $500,000.00 range, which I think was probably a little low). \n \n He, like JP, was adamant that he woudl not carry a foreign product, and counted on the fact that his product was American made as his saving grace. The month that the imported item came on the market, his sales dropped by over 90%. He organised for a patent defense, and lost everything trying to defend his patent. He is now a salesman for a (ironically enough) german toolmaker.\n \n His concept was good, and in the six months beteen the time he went to market and lost the market, he made quite a bit of money. In the end he could not compete because his manufaturer was forced to pay higher wages (by several orders of magnitude), and higher prices for hisa raw materials than the competition. \n \n Polls show that over 80% of Americans say they are willing to pay a higher price for an American made product. When it comes time to actually put their money where their mouth is they prove themselves to be less than honest about this.\n \n I am not being critical of your plan, JP, I am just wondering how you account for such things (fishing for some free tips).",

   "...\n I am not being critical of your plan, JP, I am just wondering how you account for such things (fishing for some free tips).\n\n \n Fair question. The products that we're making are made on a machine that would cost $Millions to duplicate. For a niche market, I don't think there'd be many Chinese investors wanting to clone the output for such a small market.\n If the products become highly desirable, we'll practice \"continuous improvements\" and keep them at least a generation behind.\n Also, the racing community isn't like the general consumer market. There is a high degree of brand loyalty towards products that work and cost is a minor factor. For the \"tuner market\", that's another story. There you have to strike while the iron's hot and go on to something else. I have some ideas about combining several product/services in a bundle and selling the package. Since at least one of the parts of the bundle involves installation, that immediately eliminates foreign competition. If I don't sell the product separate from the installation, they'll have to clone the product AND set up local installation sites. Since some of the technology will be patented, if they do establish domestic installation sites, they'll be US targets for infringement and not foreign targets. emoticon_xkill",

It took them a couple of years to understand the market applications, but quality is now indistinguishable from US finish work. Needless to say, no performance cranks are forged in the US. Even Ford Performance has purchased blanks from Germany for years. Crower and those few independents still left are basically job shops servicing a limited niche market.

The actual production was Chinese, but at that time US sentiment for commercial products was still Made in the USA union dominated. He did final assembly here with minimum wage help until 1995, and by then our economy was struggling to the point where price was king and country of origin was no longer a factor. He now employs only minimum wage warehouse shipping and receiving people, an office staff for billing and customer service and has an outside company do his accounting, probably in India, but he doesn't know as it comes to his controller from a US namesake.
