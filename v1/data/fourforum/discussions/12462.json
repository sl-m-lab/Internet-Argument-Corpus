   "WASHINGTON (AP) - The Obama administration on Wednesday formally endorsed a U.N. declaration calling for the worldwide decriminalization of homosexuality, a measure that former President George W. Bush had refused to sign.\n \n The move was the administration's latest in reversing Bush-era decisions that have been heavily criticized by human rights and other groups. The United States was the only western nation not to sign onto the declaration when it came up at the U.N. General Assembly in December.\n \n \"The United States supports the U.N.'s statement on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity and is pleased to join the other 66 U.N. member states who have declared their support of the statement,\" said State Department spokesman Robert Wood.\n \n \"The United States is an outspoken defender of human rights and critic of human rights abuses around the world,\" Wood told reporters. \"As such, we join with other supporters of this statement, and we will continue to remind countries of the importance of respecting the human rights of all people in all appropriate international fora.\"\n \n The Associated Press reported on Tuesday that the administration would endorse the declaration.\n \n Gay rights and other groups had criticized the Bush administration when it refused to sign the declaration when it was presented at the United Nations on Dec. 19. U.S. officials said then that the U.S. opposed discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation but that parts of the declaration raised legal questions that needed further review.\n \n According to negotiators, the Bush team had concerns that those sections could commit the federal government on matters that fall under state jurisdiction. In some states, landlords and private employers are allowed to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation; on the federal level, gays are not allowed to serve openly in the military.\n \n But Wood said a \"careful interagency review\" by the Obama administration had concluded that \"supporting this statement commits us to no legal obligations.\"\n \n When it was voted on in December, 66 of the U.N.'s 192 member countries signed the nonbinding declaration, which backers called an historic step to push the General Assembly to deal more forthrightly with anti-gay discrimination. It was endorsed by all 27 European Union members as well as Japan, Australia and Mexico.Obama administration reverses Bush policy, backs anti-discrimination text on gay rights -- chicagotribune.com\n \n Yay Obama.\n This should be a no-brainer move. It's pathetic Bush didn't sign it earlier.\n The fact that we are the ONLY WESTERN NATION that refused to sign it should shout something from the mountain tops.\n \n Bush's excuse for not signing it was pathetic.\n There are TONS of U.N. resolutions that say stuff that the U.S. ignores and acts contrary to. Does anybody really think that every other country that signed \"yes\" prevents sexual orientation discrimination in employment or housing?\n Also, I would LOVE to know where this \"state jurisdiction\" mentality was when BUSH PUSHED for the constitutional amendment on gay marriage.\n \n \"Decriminalizing homosexuality\"? That should be a no-brainer.",

The UN is a joke of an organization--they don't even try to enforce their own resolutions and they exist largely to make little nations feel like they're something more than they really are.\n\n \n The reasoning is pure and simple. With bush's track record he could give a damn about gay rights let alone intolerance or hate crimes. To appease his lobbyists and neocon friends in government of course he repealed it. He wouldn't dare turn this into a state vs federal level because one he doesn't care, and two wouldn't want the responsibility of being held accountable for his actions (ironic hmm?). \n \n However, even if you think the UN white washed and spineless, it is worthy to note that at least a group of nations is recognizing and making it a prominent issue. To be the only nation not to sign it just shows our intolerance and selfish views. No wonder the world population sneers at the name of our country. \n \n I'm sure to get alot of flack from over zealous neocons but thats the risk I take in saying this. America was founded upon principals of equality NOT morality. A seperation of church and state, an ideal where those from different backgrounds and lifestyles and colors and creeds could come without fear or persecution to start a life in this nation. \n \n We were the beacon of hope to those who sought a better life. And surprisingly we still are to some people. But for Bush and people like him to openly refuse to sign such a no brain piece of legislation protecting a minority of its citizens is just pure bigotry and party line politics at best.\n \n I just wish for once Obama would stop playing middle man and stand up for people who voted for him in confidence that he would stand up for our rights. To see the moderate view and stance he's taken on some issues is just depressing. I know he has alot to work on as far as the economy but, when something like this comes up I would expect him to stand firm and not give a half baked answer to signing it.",

   "And thats true. He may have stood up for gay rights in small and relative unseen events. But when it comes down to it he appeases to the likes of Rick Warren. Here's a tip. Just because it's a mega church with a televangelist does NOT mean it represents the majority or even the basis of most religious groups.\n \n Once I saw Warren give the benediction I knew he was playing both sides. Maybe he's playing both sides and trying to help us without inflaming the right wing neocons. Regardless If I were him I'd rather stand firm on what I believe in rather than sugarcoat horsecrap and call it ok. \n \n I'll put it bluntly, I'd rather die standing than live on my knees. In other words, people like Harvey Milk died for what they believed in. Is there no one in this nation that will stand up and cry out against the unjust bigotry, intolerance and hate?\n\n \n Actually, I respect your position and passion there. But I see it differently in the case of Warren--supporting a pluralistic society means also giving an audience to those Obama may not agree with as well. That's the thing about supposedly being for tolerance--it's sort of its own worst enemy in that to have tolerance requires being tolerant of ... well, positions you may find associated with INtolerance. If Obama starts refusing to let the Rick Warrens of the country from being able to speak, then he himself is engaging in a sort of intolerance. When over 50% of people are against gay marriage, you just can't reasonably suppress that many people. And besides, it's not like Warren was being appointed to a govt. position. It was an invocation, and one that turned out to be quite tolerant, inoffensive, and even unity-oriented, I might add.\n \n \"Help us, oh God, to remember that we are Americans, united not by race or religion or blood but to our commitment to freedom and justice for all,\" he said. \"When we fail to treat our fellow human beings and all the Earth with the respect that they deserve, forgive us.\" ~ Rick Warren, from his Obama inauguration invocation\n \n Not exactly hateful words now, are they?\n \n \nThat isn't \"tokenism\".\n And for the record Jyoshu, it's amusing to see you try to stand behind Jazyjason's position on this one. I bet dollars to doughnuts that if we questioned you on your \"agreement\" with Jazyjason and his position on such things like Rev Warren, you WOULD NOT agree.\n\n \n Geez ... \n \n And you were talking about mountains and molehills earlier .... Foundit, where I agree with someone, then I agree with them. Where I DISAGREE, then I WILL disagree. Obviously I'm not going to agree with everything JazyJason says. But in his assessment of Obama taking a moderate position on gay-related issues, I do agree with him. What's the problem?\n \n \nI'll formally ask it... Do you agree with JazyJason's assessment of Obama's Rev Warren pick and think that Obama should NOT have picked Rev Warren?\n\n \n Ask away! As you can see, on that part I don't agree. Who the heck said there had to be agreement all the way down the line here?? emoticon_xdonno",

   "Ah, yes that tired twaddle, jyoshu, that those who are intolerant of intolerance are themselves being intolerant.emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Let's see Obama invite a grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan over for tea.\n \n Oh right, but sexual orientation isn't the same as race, you will say. Gay people can live in denial of their unchosen humanity, or be in the closet. We can put on an act that we're something we're not to satisfy the prejudiced. So gay people are not entitled to the same respect if we don't make that choice to be miserable and controlled. End saracasm.",

There's quite simply no way to divorce the issue from the religious/moralistic issue for many people.

You don't get it at all. You never have. I've explained to you multiple times that different issues are addressed different ways by religion--some more culturally, some more legally. Some both. But you've always flippantly rejected this reality out of hand with nary a consideration. It's not like gay marriage is the only moralistic issue over which religious people would fight to keep illegal. I guarantee you that if groups suddenly started trying to fight so hard to make incest legal, or some bizarre form of marriage, you'd hear from them about it. And there are certainly other issues (other than marriage) that are legal fights as well that could be phrased to be cases of \"infringing on rights.\"\n \n \nYou should phrase that as \"You might as well be asking them to abandon their belief agsinst other people bowing down to idols, or any number of other religious fobiddences.\"\n\n \n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Sorry, but if someone believes someTHING is wrong, naturally you can't expect them to not hold to the view that it's wrong for OTHERS out there to do it as well--not just themselves.\n \n The issue is that they believe \"same-gender relationship\" is wrong. That it's others or themselves is irrelevant--they'd be untrue to their beliefs if that only ever applied to self and not in all cases where it exists. One doesn't hold to the view that stealing is wrong if only \"I\" do it--no, it's wrong independent of whether or not that morality is directed only inwardly OR outwardly. You only want them to engage in an INward morality here--but that's not going to happen. You're being completely unrealistic.\n \n \nI DO NOT CARE what his \"preferences\" are regarding the way I live my life. He can have his \"preferences\" all he wants, along with his judgments and prejudice. The point is that when he TAKES THAT TO GOVERNMENTAL DISCRIMINATION, THAT is where he is wrong.\n\n \n I swear--listening to some of the things said here, one would get the impression that you think Warren is an elected Senator or something. Warren is not a government. He is not a government official and has no more govt. given power than you or I. He's simply engaging in stating his views and teaching that morality, and fighting for what he thinks is right just like others do by fighting for THEIR views of what policy or our laws should be. That it plays out in AFFECTING policy in a round-about way is just par for the course. He makes no policy or law himself. If you live in a Republic--one that allows voting as we do, you have to accept that people can state their views as to what they think votes should entail--even if that means saying what they think OTHERS should vote. Welcome to a free country, and then while you're at it, get over it already. If you want to live in a fascist state where people can't try to influence law and vote, move elsewhere. I'm frankly sick of people like yourself acting like religious leaders have to be the only people in the country that can't try to influence people and how they vote, all the while bastardizing and twisting the 1st Amendment as an attempt to justify such an imposition. I don't like religious leaders trying to influence government either--I'd prefer they just stick to benevolent religion and let these other matters alone, but unlike you I realize that the cost of having a VOTING republic means we have to allow people--even high profile RELIGIOUS people--to state their opinions on how others should vote. This isn't a Nazi state, for pete's sake--we don't force silence on people just because we don't like what they're saying, out of fear they might influence the creation of a law or a vote. You don't take one right away to save another--you rather fight for the right you want in a way that's within the framework of the form of democracy we have. Bring ideas to the marketplace of ideas and people will weigh them against what you oppose, and if your views are so correct, then you'll win. But don't try to win by preventing the other team from even being able to take the field. If your stance is sound and right, it will pass the test, after all. It'll weather the storm of public discourse. It really is ok to let the conversation happen.\n \n \n\"it's a political issue\"... emoticon_rolleyes\n At times like this, I just feel like it's time some lions had some \"political issues\" with Christians again. Maybe you'd recognize that OTHER PEOPLE'S RIGHTS are not just \"political issues\" to be callously discussed and it is improper to leave it to the whim of the voters.\n\n \n Tough. You can pretend it's not a political issue and ignore the reality of the situation--that it IS of the realm of controversy--but it won't change the fact that it is indeed. You might as well be all bent out shape that people aren't keen on \"other peoples' rights\" in cases of, say, polygamy or incest to be allowed in our society. \n \n Look, obviously you're passionate about your issue. It's certainly your pet issue, and that's fine; you're the forums' main activist for the topic. But you don't own the issue, either. No one owns the morality of this topic, and people resent the idea of religious belief on this being associated with evil, callousness, or whatever other display you can add to your propagandist parade of horribles here, just as you resent the idea of people associating gay pride with such horribles.\n \n \nNO Jyoshu. I am MORE THAN WILLING to discuss my rationale behind why I think it's \"wrong\".\n\n \n I'm well aware of your reasons for thinking Warren is wrong; you've explained your position on this sort of thing before. I have no problem with them, and even agree with you in some ways. What I do have a problem with is your underlying view that when OTHER people have a DIFFERENT view of what's wrong or right on these issues, you can't seem to view them as doing anything but being dastardly for doing so. When in reality they're often just trying to work through these issues like anyone else. They aren't going to abandon their religion just because you think it's bunk.",

It's certainly your pet issue, and that's fine\n\n You know jyoshu, considering how often you post on gay threads criticizing gays, I would say it's safe to point out that criticizing gays is YOUR \"pet issue\".\n \n \n \n \nNo one owns the morality of this topic, and people resent the idea of religious belief on this being associated with evil, callousness, or whatever other display you can add to your propagandist parade of horribles here, just as you resent the idea of people associating gay pride with such horribles.\n\n I could care less what you \"resent\".\n When people try to restrict my rights, that is wrong.\n It's born out of prejudice, whether that be the \"religion prejudice\" or \"religion-free prejudice\", it's still born out of prejudice.\n \n Our country, supposedly founded on Christian values, has values like EQUALITY and JUSTICE.\n If I were to demand that Christians couldn't be able to marry, and could carry a significant vote with it, you can be darn sure you would be speaking out against it.\n But when it comes to gays, you \"resent\" the fact that we register our observations on the nature of the anti-gay actions... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nI'm well aware of your reasons for thinking Warren is wrong; you've explained your position on this sort of thing before. I have no problem with them, and even agree with you in some ways. What I do have a problem with is your underlying view that when OTHER people have a DIFFERENT view of what's wrong or right on these issues, you can't seem to view them as doing anything but being dastardly for doing so. When in reality they're often just trying to work through these issues like anyone else. They aren't going to abandon their religion just because you think it's bunk.\n\n Nobody is asking them to abandon anything Jyoshu.\n They can act, IN THEIR LIVES as they want.\n \n By your standards, are you telling me that if I were to insist that parochial schools refrain from condemning gays, and the BSA had to allow gays, introducing legislation enforcing these views, you would just assess it as \"me doing what I think is right\"???\n \n Puh-leaze!",

   "No. It's moving the goal posts.\n You started by responding to JazyJason about the reasons he was criticizing Warren. You have moved off of that subject, onto a pointless one.\n\n \n Foundit, YOU'RE choosing to belabor this by arguing with me ad infinitum about anything I say that's ADDITIONAL to the central discussion, even though you contribute such things all the time yourself on threads. You can drop your argumentativeness anytime you want. That's entirely up to you.\n \n \nYou can always tell when people like Jyoshu get desparate cause they start to compare gay marriage to \"inest\" or \"polygamy\" and other junk...\n\n \n You can always tell when people like Foundit get desparate cause they start to compare gay marriage to the plight of black people by using terms like KKK and so forth, and other junk ... emoticon_xgood\n \n Incidentally, what else, other than things like polygamy would you use for examples of ways marriage is restricted OTHER than gay marriage, to show that there are other implications afoot here? If you don't like the examples, perhaps you can provide alternative benign examples. 'Cause it's not like GAY marriage is an island, here. There's no way to discuss this issue adequately without looking at the IMPLICATIONS of broadening marriage, or using OTHER similar examples of restricted marriage to show things.\n \n \nYou're missing the point.\n I'm not talking about them THINKING it's wrong for them to do that.\n I'm talking about them PREVENTING others from doing that.\n How many times do I have to explain to you that the real issue at hand is the ACTION OF CHRISTIANS TO PREVENT GAY EQUALITY? The sad part is that I KNOW I pointed out in that post that they could believe what they want about me and condemn me all they want, in their opinion. But you REFUSE to admit that it's about the HINDERANCE of gay equality, and repeatedly try to falsely pretend it's just about \"opinion\"... emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Alright them ... how about setting us straight here, if that's the case ...\n \n At what point does participation in public discourse and trying to influence voting cross the line from being participation to being \"hindrance of gay equality\", Foundit? At WHAT POINT does it change FROM merely being about \"opinion\"? You seem to want to focus on ONLY the aspect of what you spin with terms like \"restricting\" or \"hindering\" or 'oppressing.' Are you even going to make ANY allowance for a person to have a religious view on this regarding the actions of OTHERS without spinning it in such a way? Pony up here, and start indicating where that line is, that differentiates mere participation in the process from actual prevention and infringing, from to you.\n \n (Prediction based on history: F will not actually make any effort to specify where that line is, to him. He'll dance around it or use it to attack the messenger rather than actually answering the question, or he'll attempt diversion.)\n \n \nAnd likewise, the lion is *simply engaging in stating his views on diet and teaching that eating preference to others, and fighting for what he thinks is right just like others do by fighting for THEIR views of what policy or our laws should be*...\n\n \n What a silly analogy. No one here is trying to kill and eat gay people, Foundit. We live in a free country that ALLOWS people to do what Warren is doing. This is the realm of ideas and views and morality we're talking about here.\n \n \nJust out of curiousity, who the bleep do you think you're talking to?\n Have I said ANYTHING about silencing Warren and others?\n No!\n \n My point gets back to what JazyJason was talking about before you started MOVING THE GOALPOSTS.\n We are talking about our reasons for CRITICIZING Warren,\n\n \n LOL. So you're just fine with Warren being able to go right on as he has been, as well as fine with other religious leaders, as long as you can just criticize them? Are you now saying you don't really want change; just to criticize them? 'Cause if you're now arguing as if you don't want to prevent this from happening, you sure spend a LOT of attention on it ... \n \n Anyway from other posts you've made such as all you've put out there regarding Mormons and Prop 8 and your support of measures and enforcing things to prevent the LDS from doing things they allegedly did to promote Prop 8, you'd never be able to convince people now you wouldn't want to PREVENT this sort of thing from happening--not merely \"criticize\" them.\n \n \nI could care less what you \"resent\".\n When people try to restrict my rights, that is wrong.\n\n \n Oh I know you don't care that you cause resentment. But you're begging the question again. \"Restricting rights\" is not \"wrong\" out of hand--that's an oversimplification. Using your logic, anything anyone wants to do that isn't actively is \"wrong\" in being not having a system in place to allow it. Like saying it's \"wrong\" to restrict people from marring two people at once. Like saying it's wrong to restrict people from marrying a sibling. \n \n \nOur country, supposedly founded on Christian values, has values like EQUALITY and JUSTICE.\n\n \n With that logic, we'd have to open marriage up to a whole lot more than just straights and gays.\n \n \nNobody is asking them to abandon anything Jyoshu. They can act, IN THEIR LIVES as they want.\n\n \n So you're saying effectively, you only want them engaging in an INWARD-directed morality. Never mind the fact that you would probably allow any OTHER group to try to influence votes or legislation (what you call \"restricting your rights\"). It's just religious leaders you have a hang up with here. Everyone else can participate in this way.",

Or do you just think even giving one's OPINION on how people should vote (\"advertising\") is against the constitution as well?? ;)\n \n \nThe reason this gets boring is cause I've explained it to you a dozen times, and you either insist on misrepresenting it, or you're not able to understand what I'm explaining.\n \"legitimate state interest\" is not applied to \"they can't publicly give their opinions\".\n\n \n Mm hmm ... riiiiight. So when someone like Warren gives their opinion on how people should vote, you think of it as creating law. If others do that, you only think of it as ... well, giving their opinion on how people should vote. Feel free to explain how exactly the heck you differentiate there, in your thinking. You certainly haven't \"explained\" that even once, let alone \"dozens of times\". Feel free to show where you have, if you care to stand behind your claim. I suspect you'll just respond with something along the lines that you're too bored to bother to avoid having to do so. And remember, EITHER could be construed as going against \"legitimate state interest\" so don't even try that junk at unqualification again.\n \n [COLOR=&quot;DarkRed&quot;][b]If Warren were arguing EVERYTHING he is arguing for, except he swapped \"gay\" with \"Christian\", are you saying that you would have the EXACT SAME REPLY for anybody criticizing Warren?[/quote]\n \n Weren't you just making some comment about hypotheticals in another thread?? :p If someone were making claims against Christians, I would STILL support their right to do so, and would not assert that they aren't supposed to do that. Now, care to actually address what IS happening, instead?\n \n \nIt is absolutely appalling that you toss \"ML King\" out there, when the issue is clearly PEOPLE REMOVING RIGHTS from gays.\n\n \n Not really. For the purposes of the context of what I'm trying to get you to see, what matters most is that BOTH are examples of people standing up for what they believe in due to religious conviction. That you always use the \"Hitler card\" fallacy for those for whom you happen to disagree (by ONLY ever attributing bigotry as the motive instead of the possibility that it could be religion INSTEAD) only demonstrates you begging the question every time on the issue. You don't own the issue nor do you own the moral ground on it.\n \n \nYou should have used the KKK in your example. It would have been more fitting as both groups were trying to subjugate people.\n\n \n Again, that's begging the question. One could argue ANYone who wants to marry a different way than what is accepted is being \"subjugated\". I guess if you're the sort who would use the KKK to analogize those who don't agree we should give marriage rights to people who want to marry multiple folks at once, then so be it. After all, they too could argue their needs supercede what you think are \"legitimate state interests\". emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nYour religion is your own personal relationship with Jesus. Christians seem to understand a more hands off approach (no governmental discrimination) when it comes to divorce, unwed mothers, false gods, blaspheming god, etc, etc...\n\n \n But they didn't always approach these issues as \"hands off.\" And there are other moralistic issues they DON'T approach as \"hands off\"--other than gay-related issues. (ONE example: fighting for pro-life legislation.) So it's not like this issue is unique in that regard.",

Or do you just think even giving one's OPINION on how people should vote (\"advertising\") is against the constitution as well?? ;)\n\n It's boring to watch you strip the details that you SHOULD KNOW are important to the issue from the discussion.\n If a pastor says \"I support Prop 8\" from the pulpit, that is a violation of separation of church and state.\n \n And I \"don't see why there's a need to be specific here\", where \"HERE\" is what we were ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT.\n If you want to change the goalpost location yet again, we can talk about a side-topic.\n \n But the reasons your PREVIOUS questions were trivial is unrelated to what you are now talking about.\n \n \n \nMm hmm ... riiiiight.

You certainly haven't \"explained\" that even once, let alone \"dozens of times\".\n\n I honestly didn't think the obvious needed to be explained.\n Convincing people to vote for a BILL is part of making a BILL into a law.\n Part of CREATING that law.\n \n \n \nAnd remember, EITHER could be construed as going against \"legitimate state interest\" so don't even try that junk at unqualification again.\n\n You seriously have no idea what that phrase means.\n You keep tossing it into places where I have no idea how you're trying to apply it.\n \n \"Creating\" or \"advertising\" for a law aren't issues of real \"legitimate state interest\".\n The CONTENTS of the law are what is judged by \"legitimate state interest\" standards.\n \n \n \nIf Warren were arguing EVERYTHING he is arguing for, except he swapped \"gay\" with \"Christian\", are you saying that you would have the EXACT SAME REPLY for anybody criticizing Warren?\n Weren't you just making some comment about hypotheticals in another thread??\n\n Quote me.\n My comments said nothing about NO hypotheticals allowed.\n Quote me.\n \n \n \nIf someone were making claims against Christians, I would STILL support their right to do so, and would not assert that they aren't supposed to do that. Now, care to actually address what IS happening, instead?\n\n And even now you refuse to address the question head on.\n Were we talking about \"claims against homosexuals\"???\n NO!\n \n We were talking about Rick Warren's support for Prop 8.\n If Warren were arguing EVERYTHING he is arguing for, except he swapped \"gay\" with \"Christian\", are you saying that you would have the EXACT SAME REPLY for anybody criticizing Warren?\n \n I should have known that when I said \"EVERYTHING\", you would pick the most benign part of that statement out of the mix and talk JUST about that.\n I have explicitly pointed out LEVELS of wrongness, and you go for the lowest rung.\n \n \n \nNot really. For the purposes of the context of what I'm trying to get you to see, what matters most is that BOTH are examples of people standing up for what they believe in due to religious conviction.

You don't own the issue nor do you own the moral ground on it.\n\n Jyoshu, do you really think that Hitler was fighting for something he DID NOT believe in?\n Do you really think that the KKK don't fight for something THEY do not believe in?\n By your approach, THESE ITEMS ALSO are \"examples of people standing up for what they believe in due to religious conviction\".\n \n But the KKK, Hitler, and the anti-gay share something in common that Martin Luther King was more antithetical to...\n The KKK, Hitler and the anti-gay are interested in REMOVING rights and treating a group like a second class citizen.\n \n Martin Luther King Jr was interested in REMOVING a second class citizenship, for equality.\n \n The KKK analogy is more appropriate, based on more shared similarities...\n \n \n \nYou should have used the KKK in your example. It would have been more fitting as both groups were trying to subjugate people.\n\n \nAgain, that's begging the question. One could argue ANYone who wants to marry a different way than what is accepted is being \"subjugated\".\n\n Your response is \"begging the question\".\n I raise the issue that two groups, the KKK and the anti-gay, are MORE alike, and you turn around and CHANGE THE SUBJECT ONCE AGAIN...\n \n \n \nI guess if you're the sort who would use the KKK to analogize those who don't agree we should give marriage rights to people who want to marry multiple folks at once, then so be it.\n\n Legitimate state interests...\n Once again, you IGNORE those whenever you want to try to put polygamy in the same group with gay marriage.\n As previously explained to you, REPEATEDLY, it just plain DOES NOT MATTER how much people want to \"claim\" subjugation.\n If I said \"polygamists are subjugated\", that would be MEANINGLESS to whether or not polygamists should obtain legalized polygamy.\n \n As previously explained to you, we have NUMEROUS legal precedents against establishing gender as a discriminatory factor.\n I know of NO legal precedents against \"number of people in an arrangement\" being prevented as a discriminatory factor.\n \n \n \nAfter all, they too could argue their needs supercede what you think are \"legitimate state interests\". emoticon_rolleyes\n\n This is ultimately where your arguments are their lamest.\n People \"could argue\" something???\n Is THAT all the level of analysis you can apply? Just whether or not somebody \"could argue\" a thing???\n \n As previously shown, while they could make a claim, they could not effectively defend it.\n YOU have routinely avoided providing any sort of real defense on the issue.\n \n \n \nBut they didn't always approach these issues as \"hands off.\" And there are other moralistic issues they DON'T approach as \"hands off\"--other than gay-related issues. (ONE example: fighting for pro-life legislation.) So it's not like this issue is unique in that regard.\n\n I know they \"didn't always\" approach these issues as hands off. They have had a history of sticking their nose where it didn't belong, only to later remove their nose from the issue. Galileo comes to mind, where they didn't like what he said about how the solar system worked, and later backed off.\n \n You brought up \"pro-life legislation\", which I can understand their involvement. It involves a principles of protection of life, or so they believe.\n I realize from your position, you want to vague-ify things to avoid admitting the level of change in importance between \"protecting a life\" as opposed to \"firing a gay guy just cause he's gay\".\n To even try to compare the two is disgusting.\n \n But I realize some in the Christian community do not see a difference, and as such they turn people off to \"Christianity\" in general.\n Ergo, the number drops...\n \n It's kind of interesting how more and more, gay marriage is becoming an inevitable future.\n The ploys of the anti-gay Christian extreme are more and more absurd, employing false story-telling.\n The youth are seeing through the ploys, and the fall-out ain't pretty for the Christian side of things.\n \n So Christianity can continue to be non-\"hands off\" if they like. In the end, I think it's ultimately hurting them more than us...",
