   "  CRIME: THE INNER-CITY CRISIS \n The problem of youth homicide is very heavily concentrated in black males aged 15-19.3\n For inner-city black teenagers, the homicide rate is astronomical. The huge rise in gun crime perpetrated by older urban teenagers has not been replicated in other areas. In the suburbs, where legal restrictions on guns are generally less severe, the mortality rate has stayed about the same.\n \n Gun control advocates sometimes convey the impression that current murder rates are dramatically higher than ever before. And if one looks at statistics for particular age groups, one finds a substantial rise in murder arrests. From 1985 to 1991, arrests of adults for murder declined, but arrests for murder of 17-year-old males rose 121%; arrests of 16-year-old males rose 158%; arrests of 15-year-old males rose 217%; and arrests of boys 12 and under rose 100%.\n \n The white youth homicide arrest rate has remained stable, while the black rate has skyrocketed. Some drug policy scholars trace the sudden upsurge in violence to the pharmacological effects of crack/cocaine. Economist Sam Staley argues that the war on drugs and the criminalization of the drug trade generate levels of violence that make the inner city unlivable, with levels of violence far higher than would occur in a world where drugs were controlled by means other than the criminal law.20 Since drug dealers are likely to be carrying large sums of money, they are at serious risk of robbery. Since they cannot rely on the police for protection, they must, to survive, protect themselves.\n\n These Teens are not old enough to posses a Concealed Carry Permit!\n \n  FBI: Burgeoning gangs behind up to 80% of U.S. crime \n'Growing threat' on the move \n The report says about 900,000 gang members live \"within local communities across the country,\" and about 147,000 are in U.S. prisons or jails. \n \"Most regions in the United States will experience increased gang membership &#8230; and increased gang-related criminal activity,\" the report concludes, citing a recent rise in gangs on the campuses of suburban and rural schools.\n Among the report's other findings:\n &#8226;Last year, 58% of state and local law enforcement agencies reported that criminal gangs were active in their jurisdictions, up from 45% in 2004.\n &#8226;More gangs use the Internet, including encrypted e-mail, to recruit and to communicate with associates throughout the U.S. and other countries. \n &#8226;Gangs, including outlaw motorcycle groups, \"pose a growing threat\" to law enforcement authorities along the U.S.-Canadian border. The U.S. groups are cooperating with Canadian gangs in various criminal enterprises, including drug smuggling. \n",

Although successful defensive gun uses occur\n each year, the probability of success may be low for civilian gun users in urban areas. Such users should reconsider their possession of guns or, at least, understand that regular possession necessitates careful safety countermeasures.\"\n http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1087&context=dennis_culhane\n \n Not owning a gun makes me safer and two cherry picked 911 calls does not disprove that.\n\n \n You put your faith in 911,I'll put mine in 9mm.

   "China: Attacker kills 7 children, 2 adults with meat cleaver - latimes.com\n \n \n\n Reporting from Beijing\n In the deadliest of the rampages that have terrorized China's schools, a\n middle-aged man on Wednesday hacked to death seven children and two adults\n with a meat cleaver at a preschool in Shaanxi province before going home and\n killing himself.\n \n The attacker was identified as 48-year-old Wu Huanming, who owned the\n building that housed the Linchang Village school, 100 miles from Xian,\n according to the state-run New China News Agency.\n \n Wu burst into the school about 8 a.m. as the children were arriving. Out\n of a class of about 20 children, all but three were killed or\n injured. He also killed the school's administrator and the\n administrator's mother.\n\n \n And all the gun nut grabbers can say \"it would have been bad if he could\n have gotten a gun\"!\n \n \nLarge knives and cleavers are found in nearly every Chinese kitchen.\n Experts say that because the assailants haven't gotten hold of guns,\n strictly controlled in China, they have tended to go after victims who\n are the most vulnerable.\n\n \n In the States, that would be victim disarmament zones, VDC.\n \n Just because you don't hear about them doesn't mean they aren't happening,\n it is because the news is supressed.\n \n \nThe attacks are also adding fresh fodder to the debate about media\n freedom. Authorities have avoided publicizing the attacks, citing the fear\n of copycat killers. Some coverage has appeared only on the New China News\n Agency's English-language wire. Some Chinese journalists have complained\n that they have been banned from visiting the towns where attacks took place,\n conducting interviews, publishing editorials or using any content not\n prepared by the news agency.\n\n \n I ask, sir, what is the militia? It is the whole people. To disarm the \n people is the best and most effectual way to enslave them. - George \n Mason, during Virginia's Convention to Ratify the Constitution (1788)",

   "  China Police May Use Guns to Stop School Attacks, Xinhua Says \n May 14 (Bloomberg) -- Chinese police may use firearms to prevent more attacks on schoolchildren, the official Xinhua News Agency said, citing a government spokesman, after a series of assaults left more than a dozen students dead.\n \"If offenders dare to attempt such crimes again, the police will enforce the law firmly without hesitation, in line with the Criminal Law and police code of using guns and other weapons,\" Wu Heping, spokesman for the Ministry of Public Security, was cited as saying.\n In the latest attack, a 48-year-old man armed with a cleaver hacked to death seven children and two teachers at a rural kindergarten on May 12 in the northwestern province of Shaanxi. The incident came after more than nine schoolchildren were killed and at least 50 injured in five separate assaults across the country, from the southern province of Guangdong to Shandong in the east.\n \n More Security\n In Beijing, an additional 800 security guards equipped with helmets, batons, stab-proof vests and tear gas have been deployed at schools. The city already has almost 2,000 security guards at schools, state-run Peoples.com said, citing Ma Xuguang, director of the general office at Beijing Security Service General Company.\n \n \n So much for gun control being the Holy Grail for safety!",

   "Those sychopants again. After long and protracted research at the library of Google University, I found an obscure book written in Etruscan (early) that mentions 'sychopants'. Sychopant is a composite word where 'pant' is the substantive and 'sycho' the adjectival preposition.\n Etruscans, Romans and Greeks never wore pants, only skirts and the Scots also. Why? Because they feared sychopants, why?\n \n Because sychopants are pants who have a crazy personality. For beginners they refuse to be worn; they become stiff and prevent the user from inserting his/her extremities into them, sometimes their zippers come up while the male wearer (only male wearers) is relieving himself. Thousands of cases recorded in history of involuntary appendectomies of the male sexual appendage are attributed to sychopants. \n \n Moral of the story: if you are a male of the species don't wear sychopants ever!\n\n \n OK,yeah,right I guess I feel better already now that,that is taken of(I think).",

   "so you should dispense with the armed forces and the police and the civil guard and .. etc etc\n \n Just give everyone an M-16 at birth and free ammo for life and let them fend off for themselves. Excellent idea. who needs a \"common defense\" whatever that means? \"common defense\" is for wimps! It kinda of rhymes with communism to me.\n \n There are other people in another countries such as the Taliban in Afghanistan and the people in Somalia are just two countries that come to mind, who are truly self-reliant when it comes to providing for their self-defence. Another good example is drug dealers in Mexico and Colombia. They import quality weaponry from the USA what is also good for the US economy\n \n Americans have a lot to learn from their example.;)\n\n \n We The People used to provide for our OWN defense all the way up into the early 1900's.

Then our [perverse] government decides to go after them. And guess what happened after THAT, dolt? That's RIGHT, our [perverse] government started passing 'gun control laws' which ONLY effected We The People. Making it much more difficult for us to stand up to organized crime. And, making us MORE 'dependent' upon the 'government' for 'protection'. \n \n But you know what, dolt? Our 'governments' were NOT charged with personal defense. No, in FACT they were charged with the \"COMMON DEFENSE\". And, the highest courts in the land have acknowledged that FACT - REPEATEDLY. Thus, We The People have not only the RIGHT, but the DUTY to provide for OUR OWN defense.\n \n Don't like it the way it was INTENDED, dolt? Then the answer is simple; LEAVE.",
