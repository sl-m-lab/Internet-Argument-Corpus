   "How should the U.S. deal with human cloning experiments?\n \n This is the question on todays CNN poll and perhaps one of the more interesting ones that I've seen them post in the last year. The options are to ban them or to regulate them. The poll is made in response to the following article.\n \n http://www.cnn.com/2004/HEALTH/02/12/science.clone/index.html\n \n Interestingly enough the regulate side is actually winning in the pole at this point. I figured there was just too much to fear when it come to human cloning at this point but maybe we have reached a point where people are ready to take this step. I for one am with them. I think there is a great deal of potential in this sort of experiments especially in the field of health care. I imagine one day we may be able to grow organs to meet organ transplant needs which in itself will save thousands of lives. I think this in itself makes human cloning worth a look.",

I support human cloning as a means of improving our health care. I hope that we start to see cloning become legal in countries such as South Korea as to eventually put enough pressure on the US to finally legalize it. I doubt the US will be the first to legalize it though.",

   "I'll give you an example that is a real possibility. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (Pseudohypertrophic), That this is a genetic disease has long been known. Victims rarely survive beyond 20 years, and usually half of those are in a wheelchair.\n \n Now it wasn't too many years ago that I remember that Jerry Lewis announced on the telethon that the gene responsible for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy had been identified. And that presents the possibility of some kind of gene therapy.\n \n So what if a cell from a DMD patient could be cloned and then the stem cells harvested. Suppose that through molecular genetics the faulty gene could be excised and a functional sequence inserted. And then, what if those cells could be cultivated until there were enough to create some form of vaccine that could be reintroduced, say in the bone marrow or some other region of high cellular activity. Since the cells come from the patient, they wouldn't be rejected but would be like any other stem cells of the patient. Those altered cells could produce the enzyme or protein that causes the DMD when it is absent.\n \n This is better than a treatment for a universally lethal disease. It is a cure.

But keeping cloning to individual cells isn't going to work. And it may sound like Sci-Fi, but once N. Korea of China get their hands on it, their going to create their own soldiers. And with the way wer'e progressing, in 50 years their be able to create Supersoldiers, and superscientists by dictating their DNA, and then creating them.\n \n \n Which leaves us with an important question: Who's gonna be in charge then?",

   "...but once N. Korea of China get their hands on it, their going to create their own soldiers. \n \n Are you completely mindless? N. Korea and China create their own soldiers right now. They do it the good old fashioned way, sex and upbringing. How do you imagine the N. Korea and China are going to raise these clones? You are aware that they have to be gestated for nine months just like embryos produced by sexual intercourse, don't you? And then they will need to be cared for, diapers and all for a few years, schooled for many, many years, and taught how to read, write, etc. And finally they will have to be taught how to be soldiers.\n \n Maybe you should find out what you are talking about before you speak. Clones do not create mature individuals. What are cloned are single cells, and then they have to be treated the same as any fertilized egg. That single cell has to grow into the millions that make up a mature individual. It takes years and years.",

   "Cloning is only going to be the first step though. Cloning is extremely limited as lurch has pointed out. Genetic tweaking however is much more flexible. Sure we have a long way to go in this field before we get anywhere but the same questions will be rasied about that when the time comes as are being asked now. Should the US stick to the moral standpoint and avoid researching this new and very possibly dangerous technique or should they be attempting to learn more about the field as some of our enemies surely are? China with cloning is pointless but China with genetically superior soldiers is concerning. Cloning is a first step and there will be more to follow. Should the US be concerned with this at all?",

   "There is nothing to fear from cloning at all other than the difficulties of actually getting it to work and the possible health risks to the child (though the research into creating stem cells would also solve the telomere problem...maybe even provide the hints for a longetivity treatment). Soldiers are still going to take 18 odd years to grow to maturity, and will be excessively expensive, same with genetically engineered soldiers. Same results could be pretty much obtained from having healthy people trained from birth as soldiers, but no one bothers doing that now nor worries about it. \n Closest you might ever have is a popualtion more likely to produce 'soldier standard' people by irradicating defects and maybe the odd adance added in (some anticancer or disease resistance gene), but in a large population this is hardly an issue. \n \n There was the first pet cloned some time ago, a cat. It actually looked noticably different from the 'parent' one (due to X inactivation of the fur colour deciding genes being different).",
