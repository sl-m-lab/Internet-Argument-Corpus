Bowen Jr. in Iraq have sent American occupation officials to jail on bribery and conspiracy charges, exposed disastrously poor construction work by well-connected companies like Halliburton and Parsons, and discovered that the military did not properly track hundreds of thousands of weapons it shipped to Iraqi security forces.\n \n And tucked away in a huge military authorization bill that President Bush signed two weeks ago is what some of Bowen's supporters believe is his reward for repeatedly embarrassing the administration: a pink slip.\n \n The order comes in the form of an obscure provision that terminates his federal oversight agency, the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, on Oct. 1, 2007. The clause was inserted by the Republican side of the House Armed Services Committee over the objections of Democratic counterparts during a closed-door conference, and it has generated surprise and some outrage among lawmakers who say they had no idea it was in the final legislation.\n\n \n THATS how its done.",

   "don't you see that for corrupt western powers such as the USA is better this way? It has always been. \n You give your Iraqi friends tons of money, what do they do with it? they pocket at least half of it and the rest go back in form of contracts to your friends in the USA who own the firms 'rebuilding' Iraq.\n \n The money they pocketed for themselves the Iraqis invest it in western banks which in term invest in shares of US, japanese, or European companies, so the funds paid by western taxpayers end up in the pockets of western or european shareholders. Simple\n \n The same with the oil revenues that goes back to the USA or Europe as investments. \n \n The west always wins",
