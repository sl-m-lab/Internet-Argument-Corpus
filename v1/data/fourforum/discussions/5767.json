   "That is the XXXX that I hear coming out of the conservatives mouths. Appearantly they are so American that they can throw away everything that America was founded on. \n \n I'm hearing it more and more. Rap hurts our kids and is a pollution we must get rid of it. Again the conservatives show their colors. Your only free as long as your are doing what they want.\n \n Personally I don't like rap. I never listen to it simply because I don't find depth in someone talking about how they have money. Regardless I also think that rappers have every right to say what they want and sell what they want.\n \n Here is my answer to the people that want \"offensive\" rap made illegal.\n \n DON'T BUY IT!\n \n wow, wasn't that easy? But it's on the radio right? Here is another brilliant idea, DON'T LISTEN TO IT. \n \n A flick of the wrist or the ability to keep your wallet in your pocket and magicly you don't hear rap. \n \n Then there is always the arguement that it is hurting their kids. Again I have a solution to that problem. BECOME A PARENT. That's right. I'm asking that you actually act on the family values that you preach. If you do your job as a parent then your kids could not listen to rap and you would be around to enforce that.\n \n Just because you are to lazy to watch over your kids. Doesn't give you the right to dictate what others say. It's called freedom. If you don't like it then move to Iran or North Korea. If you want it illegal then I have news for you. Rap is more American then you....",

   "Fishbulb has hit the nail on the head.I'm glad somebody brought up Mos Def before I did(or Talib Kweli,Common,The Roots,Nas,AZ,Dead Prez etc).No rap is not all about girls,power and money.Thats trash and the typical idea you get from watching MTV.There is a huge amount and I mean huge amount of brilliant Hip-Hop with talented and intelligent rappers.Simply because MTV tells you 50 cent or Game(both mediocre) are the best rappers out there and that 'Candy Shop'(good beats,not much else) is the epitome of Hip-Hop doesn't make it so.It simly means that the music industry never changes,forever people that can be 'sold' are out on the TV rather then those with talent,not just with Hip-Hop but on rock,metal etc.\n \n Despite being a massive Punk,Metal,Classic,Jazz etc fan I can easily say that Hip-Hop has tracks better then any other genres like Nas's Life's a Bitch,AZ's Rather Unique,The Roots How They Do and Talib Kweli's Good Mourning.",

   "While I agree it should be allowed, I would like to point out that it is virtually impossible to not expose a kid to rap. At school every lunch we have music almost all of which is rap. I really have no problem with it and think kids should be exposed to that sort of thing. A really responsible parent is one that exposes them to things such as this and explains that just because it talks about stuff, doesn't mean it's true.\n \n \n Anyway... I don't particularly like rap, although I don't hate it. But when I'm at home, I don't turn on a rap station and I don't own a rap CD, if you don't like it, don't listen, and kids will be exposed to it anyway, may as well do it while they have parenting to help them understand.",
