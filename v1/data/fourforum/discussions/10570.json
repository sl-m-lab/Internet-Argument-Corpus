   "For the second time in as many years I watched a fascinating TV special on Nature relating to venom and Little Killers. For the second time in as many years I was puzzled by the fact that Australia has THE most powerfully equipped snakes (the top two) and spiders (...again, I think the top two) in the world considering the strenghth of their venom.\n \n IIRC, the deadliest spider is the male of the species called Sidney Tunnel Web Spider. His venom gains strength as he rejects dining in an agressive search for a mate of his own kind...becoming 5 times as concentrated as the female's.\n \n There was an attribute of one of the spiders...I think either the Wolf Spider or the Redback (closely kin to our Black Widow) that caught my attention last night. it seems that all mammals (dogs,cats,mice, etc) except monkeys and humans are relatively immune to their venom. How can that be? Does it point to a closer relationship between man and ape?",

For the second time in as many years I was puzzled by the fact that Australia has THE most powerfully equipped snakes (the top two) and spiders (...again, I think the top two) in the world considering the strenghth of their venom.\n\n \n The reason Australian snakes are so venemous is that their fangs are short. Rattlesnakes, for example, inject their venom into the blood stream, where it spreads quickly. Australian snakes inject their venom into the lymph system, where it spreads much more slowly. Since it spreads slowly, it needs to be much more powerful to bring down they snake's prey.\n \n \n \n\n There was an attribute of one of the spiders...I think either the Wolf Spider or the Redback (closely kin to our Black Widow) that caught my attention last night. it seems that all mammals (dogs,cats,mice, etc) except monkeys and humans are relatively immune to their venom. How can that be? Does it point to a closer relationship between man and ape? \n\n \n Without knowing more details I can only guess at the how. The venom is probably a neuroblocker, which means it reacts with receptors on the victims nervous system, blocking signals and causing paralysis and/or death. The poison has to be the right \"shape\" to block the receptor, so it's not surprising that it might only effect one type of nervous system.\n \n As for the relationship between man and ape; it's well established. We know they are our closest relatives. That we are the same on the nervous system level is no surprise; if a venom effected one and not the other that would be interesting.",

   "Further thought. Having discussed this with the wife (an actual evolutionary biologist) it should be pointed out that the spider probably did not adapt to be particularly poisonous to people and apes. Evolution requires two things: variation and selection. The fact that the venom works particularly well on people is probably an example of variation. Since people are not a spider's natural prey there's no reason to believe that the venom was selected for on that basis however. It's probably just coincidence.",

Except for the aborigines, Australia was populated by the Brits as the Queen used Australia as a dumping ground for criminals. \n \n IIRC, there's also a mole looking dude that is unaffected by Australian ticks and acts as a host for swelling females. Other mammals are not so lucky to have become immune to the tick's juices....they die from prolonged tick bites.",
