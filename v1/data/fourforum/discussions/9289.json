Not to mention the slightly bizarre tactic of demanding Iran stops its nuclear program so the US can talk to them about Iran helping them) and finally to push a lot more fiercely for the Israel/Palistine peace process (which isn't going to happen as it would too negatively effect Israeli/US relations).\n \n The solutions were widely regarded as the weakest part of the report, far more important was the statement that a humanitarian catestrophy is inevitable unless some monumental effort is put in to prevent it.",

   "I read a summary of the report. Typical political non-offensive, non-obligatory rehash of known circumstances with known options reiterated. \n \n A key comment by the White House;\n \n ~White House aides, however, said Bush does not share the Iraq Study Group's uncertainty about the ultimate success of the U.S. mission.\n \n ''The president feels confident (of victory in Iraq) for the following reason ... The president believes in the transformational power of liberty,'' White House spokesman Tony Snow said.~\n \n \n Here's an interesting section of the report regarding US under-reporting of violence in Iraq:\n \n http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/politics/16181637.htm\n \n ~On page 94 of its report, the Iraq Study Group found that there had been \"significant under-reporting of the violence in Iraq.\" The reason, the group said, was because the tracking system was designed in a way that minimized the deaths of Iraqis.\n \n \"The standard for recording attacks acts as a filter to keep events out of reports and databases,\" the report said. \"A murder of an Iraqi is not necessarily counted as an attack. If we cannot determine the source of a sectarian attack, that assault does not make it into the database.\n \n A roadside bomb or a rocket or mortar attack that doesn't hurt U.S. personnel doesn't count.~",
