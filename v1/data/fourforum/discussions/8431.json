   "Cross burned at gay man's house \n By ASSOCIATED PRESS \n July 3, 2006 \n \n \n ATHENS, Tenn. - The Meigs County Sheriff's Department is investigating a possible hate crime after someone burned a cross at the home of a gay man. \n The cross, between 6 and 8 feet tall, was discovered by Brandon Waters, along with a derogatory message late Thursday at his home. \n \n \"There are a lot of people that don't approve of it,\" the 23-year-old Waters told The Daily Post-Athenian, referring to being gay. \"They are always bashing us. It makes me fearful of what could happen. I just want to live my life.\" \n \n State fire officials were expected to arrive Monday to assist the sheriff's department in the investigation. \n \n Sheriff Walter Hickman said if the burning is determined to be a hate crime, it could warrant federal charges. \n \n \"Right now we are looking at all angles,\" Hickman said. \"It's a concern because it's a crime.\" \n \n As far as he can recall, Hickman said the incident is the first of its kind in the county's history.\n http://www.knoxnews.com/kns/state/article/0,1406,KNS_348_4819675,00.html",
