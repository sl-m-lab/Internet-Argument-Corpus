They remain silent( Any reason?) \n \n \n Why should people who believe in God turn their back on him?\n \n \n \n Is other paraphila relations like Incest/ bestalism/ necrophilia ect.....\n wrong or what?\n \n \n Why are so many paraphiles in the R.C.C.?",

Because practised safely it is no more dangerous than heterosexual sex, could even point out that intolerance of their way of life is even more harmful\n \n 2.) No, but neither are homosexual relationships. Don't think I have ever met someone who was gay and thought anything different.\n \n 3.) Silly question, God doesn't exist either- but if he does then surely he would be responsible for a naturally occuring lust/sex drive?\n \n 4.) Doesn't really concern them, so they care as much as anyone else does. Why don't lebanese pentioners be more vocal about it?\n \n 5.) Because they have seen the real truth and chosen reason over primative supersticion;) (damn again!) or at least have found they can not accept that the loving god they were brought up to beleive in would turn his back on them?\n \n 6.) If they involve some kind of non-consensual activity yes, if not, no, not really.\n \n 7.) Bad PR, old stereotypes, increased opertunity and the standing of the organisation is why you hear of more.",
