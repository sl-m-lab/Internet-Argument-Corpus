   "Domestic Partnership Proposal Headed To The Voters\n \n (CBS4/AP) DENVER A proposal allowing same-sex couples to obtain some of the same protections as married couples under state law is headed to the voters.\n \n State representatives voted to re-adopt the proposal (House Bill 1344) Thursday, meaning it now will appear on November's ballot.\n \n \"The voters will have the final say on this,\" said Sen. Joan Fitz-Gerald, D-Golden.\n \n The ballot also could have a proposal asking voters to ban gay marriage as well as one that would bar any arrangements that are similar to marriage.\n \n \"I think that people, given the opportunity to say 'you know I have these rights and responsibilities, why am I afforded this and someone else is not,'\" Fitz-Gerald said. \"These are economic rights, this is a fairness issue.\" \n \n Critics say domestic partnerships are a new form of marriage, but supporters stress it's something different.\n \n Opponents argued since the proposal gives same-sex couples the same rights as spouses, to say it is not a same-sex marriage bill is a deception to voters. \n \n \"I think it's time to kind of perk our ears up and say 'wait a minute, this in fact is another form of marriage' and if the proponents of this want that, they should just come out and say so,\" Dyer said.\n \n \"It tries to create all of the rights and benefits and duties of marriage,\" said Sen. Shawn Mitchell, R-Broomfield. \"It's a same sex marriage bill and supporters should be honest and admit that.\" \n \n Under the plan, domestic partners wouldn't be able to file joint tax returns and could be turned away by adoption agencies. The partnerships wouldn't have any legal status outside of Colorado and partners wouldn't receive any of the federal benefits and protections for married couples.\n \n The bill would allow domestic partners the right to visit their partner in the hospital, to qualify to be included on health insurance plans, to sue for the wrongful death of a partner and to automatically inherit their property.\n \n \"All we're doing at this point is saying look, 'you have an opportunity Colorado voters to decide whether you think this is fair and equitable treatment for those who cannot marry in our state,'\" said Sen. Jennifer Veiga, D-Denver. \n http://cbs4denver.com/politics/local_story_124211740.html",

   "Here in California, we have 'domestic partnerships'. In addition, a law preventing governmental recognition of gay marriage has been passed.\n \n When the law against gay marriage was passed, the proponents for that law EXPLICITLY stated that it would not impact the existing domestic partnerships.\n \n Later, after the law was passed, the opponents of gay marriage THEN SWITCHED to trying to use the anti-gay marriage law to quash domestic partnership laws, using a similar tactic as this article discusses.\n \n To put it bluntly, they lied.\n \n And here we see something similar. Opponents of gay marriage trying to not only prevent \"gay marriage\", but also prevent ANY FORM of recognized gay unions whatsoever...\n Claiming it is a 'form of marriage'...\n \n Is there any doubt that a lot of this has NOTHING to do with \"protecting marriage\" (from non-existent attacks), but rather in ensuring that discrimination against gays continues???\n \n \n And just out of curiousity, is there ANYBODY that this 'form of marriage' argument is going to win over?\n I just don't see it as a convincing argument at all...\n People already KNOW what \"domestic partnerships\" are, and giving it the name \"form of marriage\" isn't going to do anything beyond provide a talking point for people who can't debate the issue in the first place...",
