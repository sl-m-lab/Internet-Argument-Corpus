Given your ignorance elsewhere, it's safe to assume you have absolutely no knowledge of the digitization of records that is slowly occurring in our ever so slow government. Digitization of such documents saves space, money, and labor. Instead of going looking for one birth certificate in an archive of millions, states can simply run a search on a network, pull up the file and print it. Cheaper, faster, more efficient. Thus, anyone who requests their birth certificate is not likely to get an original copy of the original. They'll get a copy of the digitized one. Furthermore, states are going to standardize their fonts and forms to make it all the same. Hence the revisions. The argument of font is idiotic as it ignores how birth certificates are printed, archived and distributed these days. \n \n This isn't Bush's records in the air guard. \n \n \nThere is no signature on the document...could have been printed in just about anybody's basement.\n \n Barack is a fraud.\n\n \n Too bad that the state says you're full of ####.",
