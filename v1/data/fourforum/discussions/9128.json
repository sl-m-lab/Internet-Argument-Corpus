   "I haven't heard much talk about how marriage equality would be good for the economy. Seeing how gay marriage hurts no one, but obviously encourges stable, monogomous relations, helps business' that would cover the spouse, which leads to happy productive employees AND would boost the economy. Seems it all boils down to prejudice and hatred. If you think hatred is too harsh a word to use, how about dislike or disgust. In other words, marriage=sex and sex between same sex couples is icky. (Most gays thinks sex between man and woman is disgusting but we don't want your relationships to not be recognized). All this talk about preserving marriage is bull, the usual talking points is nothing but a smokescreen and those that spew that nonsense even know it. Since marriage has already been deteriating for years, I haven't seen even close to an equal amount of attention given to this trend as given to marriage equality. Why don't people just come clean and say how they really feel, keep their religion where it belongs: in their church and in their personal lives. Ok, enough rambling, here's the article: \n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/po/20061012/co_po/studymarriageequalitygoodfortheeconomy\n \n Giving same-sex couples the right to marry nationwide would be not only be a boost to equality but a boost to the economy. \n \n A new study released Tuesday by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law indicates that there are numerous economic benefits to marriage equality. \n \n The study, titled \"The Effect of Marriage Equality and Domestic Partnership on Business and the Economy,\" tracked other research studies and found that gay workers who receive domestic-partnership benefits are more comfortable in their work environment and far happier -- and more productive -- than employees who do not receive them. \n \n The study also showed that it can be costly for businesses to manage benefits for its employees in same-sex relationships without a uniform standard of legal recognition. \n \n \"Policy-makers and businesspeople have not fully recognized the enormous potential gains to the economy from treating same-sex couples equally,\" M. V. Lee Badgett, the study's coauthor and research director of the Williams Institute, said in a statement. \n \n \"Our study shows that equal treatment of couples in the business world attracts heterosexual employees and creates more productive workplaces for gay, lesbian, and bisexual employees,\" Badgett said. \n \n The study underscored the specific financial gain that would be spurred by same-sex marriage. \n \n \"Spending on new weddings alone would generate $2 billion for businesses in the wedding industry,\" Gary J. Gates, senior research associate at the Williams Institute and study coauthor, said in the statement. \n \n \"Places that allow same-sex couples to marry have reported noticeable boosts in business for hotels, caterers, florists, and other wedding-related businesses.\" \n \n The Williams Institute, founded in 2001, studies sexual-orientation law and public policy.
