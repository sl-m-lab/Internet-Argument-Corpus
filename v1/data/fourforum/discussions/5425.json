   ".\n \n Why the girl?,if they obtain my permission for painkillers and she falls ill.it is my fault and not the girls,so what is different for the school/doctor.?\nIf they don't get your permission for the painkillers and she falls ill, it could be deemed their fault. The rules on prescribing drugs is very strict and not at all logical at times (being based in part around protecting the proscriber from being sued). For example if you came to me and said you had a headache, I could offer you paracetamol. If you had done so two years ago though, I'd have had to tell you to go to a pharmacist as I was a first-aider at the time (it's subsequently lapsed) and offering you them would have been seen as proscribing.\n \n Having an abortion is a wholely different thing to proscribing drugs though. There it doesn't just affect your daughter, it affects another potential person too, one for whom you have no legal right to guardianship. In addition, a school has a duty to balance the fact that a 15 year old might not want her parents to know certain things against the parents right to be told. How many kids are going to be concerned about their parents knowing they are being given paracetamol?\n \n In an ideal world, we would expose kids to sex education and what is involved in bringing up a child from the moment they started school. By the time they reached pubity, they would understand the concequences of sex, they would know that it is illegal for anyone to have sex with an under 16 year old girl and they would understand what the implications of having the child or having an abortion were. Then we might see an end to the ridiculous statistic of the UK having the highest under-age pregnancy rate of western Europe and we could minimise the number of occasions that a child has an abortion. We do not live in an ideal world though, so we put up with the mess of the real one.",

That's why there's often several sheets of medical reports for a patient to fill out...annoying things they are. All he has to do is present that in court showing that there was no listed allergies and he bears far less responsibility.\n It would fall some onto a parent for not informing his daughter that the family had allergies...but, do you really think a pregnant minor who is having an operation performed behind her parents back is thinking clearly or, more concerned with concocting a story to explain where they were and what their next steps are. She might even down play what an allergy is thinking that the negatives of that are less than the negatives of being pregnant.

Where it seems you can't even have a simple discusion without it turning into a 'I must win this arguement and press forward my agendas or all is lost' They refuse to conceed a point and desire to present their opinions as factual, their beliefs as absolutes.\n Both sides of this debate have many players who fall into this catagory.\n The fundys who think god is pervasive and a soul is attached to all mankind and 'It's An Absolute Fact!!!' And the pro-lifer who get's too emotional and wishes to attach 'think of the wee lil baby, you were one too!1!!1!' to try to pursuade people.\n \n \n Maybe it's a chemical reaction in the brain some undergo. Most humans do respond in a certain way to the young based upon visuals and other cues. This could explain why some people change their stances on abortion issues once they've had their own child. It could be a genetic trigger for some that goes towards our communal social behavior...protecting the young, increasing the numbers whatever. Like genestealers...protect the brood...protect the young...produce pure breeds...dominate.

You'll rarely find a young athiest who is pro-life protesting.\n Pro-choicers seem to be younger with the occasional activist like Simone who appears to me to be a little vitriolic and dismissive who's probably around 50 years old.\n \n It's not terribly hard to read a poster after several weeks of viewing their posts.\n \n And, it is odd how someone changes their belief systems based on personal events. That is an observation and not an indication that the majority of young people change their belief systems later but, more seem to go pro-life afer being initially pro-choice than the other way around.\n \n Observations are just that. View points. At no time did I say there were 'universally' true or that 'it's bouind to happen, you'll turn pro-life later and I can dismiss your childish beliefs now.' If that was how you were interpreting my post.\n \n But, maybe you have 15+ years of experience in the hands on level of pro-life/choice movements. *shrugs*",

   "Assuming she used them in the first place.\n Indeed. Assuming that I even have a daughter in the first place. Having been raised amongst people whose parents were open about birth control, I somehow feel comfortable providing my own daughter with it. If she doesn't choose to use it, and still requests an abortion, well, them's the breaks you know. \n \nKids have a habit of simply not doing what you have instructed them to do.\n Really? You think? That's why parenting isn't just about giving orders, I suspect.\n \nAnd while the 'catch they while they're young' brain-washing methods espoused by both sides sound good, they really aren't 100% effective.\n It's good on paper, but implementation seems to be an issue for some people - like in everything else. \n \nSo, we get christian fundies who think they have raised a decent person with a backbone and moral fortitude...who caves in to the peer presures of their boy/girlfriend and pops a bun in the oven (sometimes through ignorance \"I dodn't know you could get pregnant on the 1st try' or 'well, I jumped up an down after we did it...').\n And you get people who think they've raised a conscientious pro-choice daughter who turns out to be dumber than a bag of hammers. That's the thing about parenting, you really have to customize it to the child. You can't assume anything about them. There is no royal road to parenting, as the saying goes. \n \nYou could also get a 14 year old daughter, Nurglitch, you thinks the best way to keep her boyfriend is to get knocked up and risk a pregnancy and no matter what you tell her, thinks it's a swell idea to have a child at such an age. There have been many cases of 'pro-CHOICE' parents pressuring their children to have an abortion.\n Exactly. That's why I'm pro-choice, because it's her decision. If she wants to keep the child, then that's her decision and we'll have to make sure it turns out for the best. \n \nAll sorts of things happen. As they say 'The best laid plans...'\n The best laid plans tend to work. If you fail, your plan was inadequate. \n \nI'm also curious, Nurglitch, on your initial thoughts on how you'd react if you were married for several years and you thought your wive shared your general attitudes and she decided to get an abortion with your 1st pregnancy against your wishes. *Generic scenario*\n Her choice. Mind you, I'm curious as to how I'd be married and yet have a wive who decides to get an abortion when we decide to have kids. \n \nFrom my perspective and experience, many pro-abortionist take an antiseptical look at abortion, trying to remove themselves from any aspect of the equation and don't have any children of their own (so their empathy and sympathy levels aren't, IMO, fully developed) OR they fall into the bitter level of activist. Where it seems you can't even have a simple discusion without it turning into a 'I must win this arguement and press forward my agendas or all is lost' They refuse to conceed a point and desire to present their opinions as factual, their beliefs as absolutes.\n Of course, it helps to distinguish between the \"pro-abortion\" and \"pro-choice\" sides. Around here that seems de rigeour for all 'sides'. In fact that seems to be a fact of life. One of my arguments against democracy is that most people are incapable of developing informed opinions about subjects outside of a narrow area of speciality. \n \nBoth sides of this debate have many players who fall into this catagory. The fundys who think god is pervasive and a soul is attached to all mankind and 'It's An Absolute Fact!!!' And the pro-lifer who get's too emotional and wishes to attach 'think of the wee lil baby, you were one too!1!!1!' to try to pursuade people.\n Sometimes you get both in one person. Voice of Reason is a wonderful example. Not to same that plenty of pro-abortion and pro-choice people are incapable of rational argument, but then stupid people are universal. \n \nMaybe it's a chemical reaction in the brain some undergo. Most humans do respond in a certain way to the young based upon visuals and other cues. This could explain why some people change their stances on abortion issues once they've had their own child. It could be a genetic trigger for some that goes towards our communal social behavior...protecting the young, increasing the numbers whatever. Like genestealers...protect the brood...protect the young...produce pure breeds...dominate. [/gamer nerd] [/idle speculation]\n No, it's actually just like Genetealers. Mothers in particular experience changes in brain and body chemistry after their initial parenthood that make them tougher, more aggressive, and more ornery. Apes and monkeys in zoos in particular need to learn how to be good parents through experience. \n \nBut, it is odd at times how a young idealistic (enlightened) person changes into a pro-lifer/anti-abortionist later in life.\n Like I said, there's some stupid people out there. If your pro-choice position was so intrinsically weak that you can't hold it after having children, you probably shouldn't be holding it. That's the problem with youth, is that you're dumb enough to be satisfied with any sufficiently reasonable explanation, and confident enough that you can rest easy thereafter. The problem isn't with idealism, the problem is that idealism is satisfied too easily. The young person realizing the so-called 'error' of their ways is a joke, it's so common. Mind you, the best pro-choice arguments I've heard have been from rather wise older married people who were willing to subject their opinions to the strongest scrutiny - not like young idealists and extremists.",

   "Birth control stops everything then,what if your daughter[if you have one] has sex and instaed of getting pregnant catchs an std,\n A do you still think she is going to come talk to you about it.?\n B will you still say thems the breaks you know?\n Unless the STD is something rather important like HIV or Syphilis or Hepatitis, I don't think that my daughter's stds are really any of my business. If she gets an STD then she can take it up with her doctor. Mind you, since she'll know as much as possible about STDs, how to protect herself and how her parents will drive her to the clinic and so on, I think it's unlikely.\n \nWhat will you do if she comes home and says\"i have had an abortion\",because if you really think that a teenage girl is going to talk to her father about sex you are sadly mistaken,i know because i have got a fifteen year old daughter and she won't even talk about if she has a boyfriend most of the time,it really makes no difference what sort of parent you are teenagers are controlled by two forces,their hormones and their peers,when a child reaches teens everything you have taught/advised or even told them not to do becomes the most enjoyable thing they can do,because it is against you.\n Yeah, teenagers are uncommunicative and rebellious, tell me something new. But if they have something to channel that energy into, like sports and so on, they're much more manageable. \n \nFor example my wife and i had a discussion about whether or not to let my daughter have access to the internet,for the past year she has been allowed restricted access on either mine or the wifes pc and under strict supervision.During this time we have shown her newspaper articules and advised her of the danger of certain places on the internet.Now my daughter is far from stupid [top 5% in her year,though where she gets it from i have no idea lol] she listened to what we had to say and took on board that it was not because we were mean but for her own saftey,we then gave her the internet in her bedroom.\n Cool. When I was a kid I was allowed unfettered access to my parent's computer. Like all of my peers. Mind you, that was before internet chat-rooms and all (or at least the ones that you pick up sex-dates in). However, again, I was too busy with my own peers and activities to even consider meeting anyone off the internet. \n \nThree months later while trying to fix her pc for her i found that she had arrainged to meet someone whilst away from home with the school.This person she had never seen,spoken too or knew anything about was going to meet her whilst she was miles away from home with her school.Now we had tried hard to stop her doing this sort of thing and yet she still did it,so do not sit there and tell me what teenagers are going to do,or not do\nSo what's up with your kid that she has the time and interest to pick people up in internet pick-up sites and chat-rooms? As a teenager I was training for swimming nearly thirty hours a week and driving nearly 7 hours a day. It wasn't the I didn't have the interest or the opportunity, it's just that I had other priorities. Like the people I swam with and grew up with. The result of a healthy and active lifestyle I'm afraid. \n \n I mean, however you raise your kids is fine with me so long as the kid doesn't mind. That's your business and theirs, not mine. Supposing that the children of a complete stranger, i.e.: me, are going to grow up in the same fashion and will face the same issues is a little absurd. Not everyone shares your culture and its problems. That said, the problems that our cultures share seem to be less consequential, less problematic, in my culture.",

   ".\n \n \n \n What about family medical history does that not play a part,what if me or her mother were allergic to anaesthetic,they would not know that and as it is genetic then there is a good chance so could she.I think that too much is done to help children obtain abortions but not enough to educate them about sex itself,then there might not need to be so many.Why is it only in obtaining an abortion and no other medical procedure.?\n\n \n 1) Allergies are not genetic. (Drs. ARE also trained to handle severe allergic reactions.)\n 2) Drs. DO (as Nerlicht has said) take medical histories and get medical records and call the girls other Drs. if they have concerns. HIPPA laws protect her privacy so her family doc can't call home to say he/she knows she's having an abortion.\n 3) Yes we need better sex ed in this country for exactly that reason.\n 4) Most other medical proceedures are \"accecptable\" to most parents and they are happy to sign releases.
