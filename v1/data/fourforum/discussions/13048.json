Why don't they care more for themselves and their families rather than slavishly adoring the rich?\n\n I hope you realize that this must have been a joke poll, not a real one - or just a joke article. \n \n Nevertheless, there is a general trend that most Americans don't discuss class issues since they have an unrealistic expectation that their probability of getting rich is sufficiently high or that those who are rich earned all of their wealth (as opposed to often taking a very disproportionate share of the wealth that was earned by group effort). American CEOs as a group are far better paid on average than those of other Westernized countries. Most Americans either don't see that or don't care because of the mythologized American dream. The American Dream certainly does still exist but inter-class mobility is not nearly as high as many imagine.",

Mr Buffett told his audience, which included John Mack, the chairman of Morgan Stanley, and Alan Patricof, the founder of the US branch of Apax Partners, that US government policy had accentuated a disparity of wealth that hurt the economy by stifling opportunity and motivation.\n \n Buffett blasts system that lets him pay less tax than secretary",
