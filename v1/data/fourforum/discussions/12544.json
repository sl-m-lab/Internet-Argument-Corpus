   "A recent exchange between Chester and myself in the elections thread (Now that Obama's elected, what comes next?) led to this. Note: This post is only half about Chester. The other half is the general situation and the obvious disparity in responses between some of the key nations involved. \n \n I made the statement:\n \nA decisive action that would impress me would be stationing several naval vessels in the area to sink all the pirates before they hijack any more ships. It's not just about fixing the current situation, it's about preventing future situations.\n\n Now I know this is a large area of ocean we are talking about, and that many naval vessels from 11 different nations are currently in the waters. It seems to me that with 11 different nations involved, it should not be too difficult to maintain a somewhat adequate coverage of the problem areas. It would make even more sense to me to limit shipping to a narrow lane through the trouble area, eliminating the need to patrol the entire area. This would provide the naval vessels a much smaller area to patrol. My general point was that we should be taking the fight to the pirates, using whatever military force needed to stop the pirates. \n \n Chester responds with this:\n \nThe rest is spoken like a true Maoist who believes that all power comes out of the barrel of a gun.\n\n I love being called a \"Maoist who believes that all power come out of the barrel of a gun\" for suggesting the use of force by the guy who was just praising \"Obama's Plan\" which resulted in the shooting of 3 pirates. Ironic? You decide.\n \n Also of note, I asked Chester: \nWhat would you propose to deal with the pirates?\n\n I got no response. I figured that someone who would call me a Maoist for suggesting the use of force to deal with violent pirates must have his own ideas about what to do to fight them, but perhaps I figured wrong?\n \n Then, the French...yes, that's right...THE MAOIST FRENCH!!!\n \nFrench naval forces launched an early-morning attack on a suspected pirate \"mother ship\" 550 miles east of Mombasa and seized 11 men, thwarting an attack on the Liberian cargo ship Safmarine Asia, the French Defense Ministry said. No one was injured.\n \n The ministry said the vessel was a larger ship that pirates use to allow their tiny skiffs to operate hundreds of miles off the coast.\n \n French Foreign Ministry spokesman Christophe Prazuck said a French helicopter in the area heard a distress call from the Safmarine Asia. He described the seized ship as a small, noncommercial vessel carrying fuel, water and food supplies.\n \n The 11 pirates, believed to be Somalis, were being held on the Nivose, a French frigate among the international fleet trying to protect shipping in the Gulf of Aden.\n \n France has been proactive against pirates for at least the past year, intervening to save three of its ships and spearheading a Europe-wide anti-piracy force called Atalanta. French politicians have sought to have other European countries take greater action against pirates.\n \n Three Somali pirates in the French city of Rennes faced judicial investigation after being captured in a hostage rescue Friday. Several other pirates also have been in French custody since last year.\n\n \n FOXNews.com - French raid pirate ship, US seeks to freeze assets - International News | News of the World | Middle East News | Europe News\n \n Meanwhile, back at the ranch:\n \nIn Washington, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced new diplomatic efforts to freeze the pirates' assets and said the Obama administration will work with shippers and insurers to improve their defenses against pirates, part of a diplomatic initiative to thwart attacks on shipping.\n \n \"These pirates are criminals, they are armed gangs on the sea. And those plotting attacks must be stopped,\" Clinton said at the State Department.\n \n Clinton did not call for military force, although she mentioned \"going after\" pirate bases in Somalia, as authorized by the U.N. several months ago.\n \n She said it may be possible to stop boat-building companies from doing business with the pirates.\n \n The measures outlined by Clinton are largely stopgap moves while the administration weighs more comprehensive diplomatic and military action.\n \n She acknowledged it will be hard to find the pirates' assets. But she wants the U.S. and others to \"explore ways to track and freeze\" pirate ransom money and other funds used in purchases of new boats, weapons and communications equipment.\n \n \"We have noticed that the pirates are buying more and more sophisticated equipment, they're buying faster and more capable vessels, they are clearly using their ransom money for their benefit _ both personally and on behalf of their piracy,\" she said. \"We think we can begin to try and track and prevent that from happening.\"\n \n Clinton said the administration will also call for immediate meetings of an international counterpiracy task force to expand naval coordination.\n \n The U.S. plans to send an envoy to an April 23 conference on piracy in Brussels. The U.S. will also organize meetings with officials from Somalia's largely powerless transitional national government as well as regional leaders in its semiautonomous Puntland region to encourage them to do more to combat piracy.\n\n This part really throws me. Freeze their assets? Like their Swiss bank accounts? emoticon_rolleyes Stop boat building companies from dealing with the pirates? Like they don't just hijack or steal the boats and equipment they need? emoticon_rolleyes That's it...call Tracker Boats and Evinrude...they can't deal with the pirates anymore!!! Anything the pirates want will be readily available for the right price regardless of \"freezing of assets\". These pirates are local hoodlums who steal, extort, kill, and hijack to get what they need. They are not international business men that we can starve out by freezing their bank accounts...I would bet that most of them have never been to a bank in the first place. \n \n But then, there is light. Apparently, the administration is investigating \"going after\" pirate bases, and weighing \"comprehensive diplomatic and military action\". So is it true? Are we to adopt the Maoist policies of armed action against the pirates at the direction of the Obama administration, or is this simply empty rhetoric? I noticed that Chester became awfully quiet on the other thread...wonder what he has to say about this?\n \n On the pirate front:\n \n \nAnother U.S. freighter headed to port with armed sailors aboard after pirates damaged it with gunshots and grenades.\n \n One pirate issued a new threat to \"slaughter\" Americans, and Tuesday's assault on a second U.S. cargo ship, the Liberty Sun, underscored the outlaws' ability to act with impunity despite international naval operations against them and mounting concern worldwide over how to end the escalating attacks off the Horn of Africa.\n \n Pirates bombarded the U.S.-flagged Liberty Sun with automatic weapons fire and rocket-propelled grenades, but its American crew of about 20 successfully blockaded themselves in the engine room and warded off the attack with evasive maneuvers.\n \n The ship, carrying food aid for hungry Africans _ including Somalis _ was damaged \"pretty badly\" on its bridge, a U.S. official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record about the ship.\n \n Windows were blown out and the crew had to put out a small fire, the official said, but they were still able to navigate. By the time the USS Bainbridge arrived five hours later, the pirates were gone.\n\n Add to that, the pirates have seized 4 vessels and 75 hostages since Sunday when we killed the 3 pirates in the standoff.\n \n So the French are doing their part to kick butt, Hillary and the administration are talking about maybe doing something, and the pirates are vowing to slaughter Americans and \"acting with impunity\" except for several French interventions. \n \n When pirates are hijacking ships, threatening to slaughter unarmed French and American merchant sailors, and firing RPG's and machine guns at unarmed crews on unarmed vessels...the time to talk is over. The time to act is now. \n \n Does it strike anyone that the French are taking decisive action while the US is talking about things and weighing options? Am I missing something?",

   "I wasn't talking about using torpedoes against fishing boats, pleasure boats, etc. I was talking about using them against the previously hijacked boats, one of which was used to transport the pirates out to the Maersk just last week. These pirates are using these commandeered ships at will to further their so called business plan as the liberals like to refer to their career of choice.\n\n \n The boats they are using for mother ships are mostly fishing boats. To be specific, they are known as Dhows. They are not using supertankers and cargo ships as mother ships...that would be the acme of foolishness. \n \n Hardly worthy of a torpedo\n \n Some well placed .50 cal machine gun fire at the water line could sink this. I have no problem with us sinking or destroying these boats, as long as we compensate the owner. \n \n As for sinking the large commercial vessels and potentially killing the hostages in the process, grow up.",
