For if there were any question Palin is unqualified for the vice presidency, this phone call has established her gullible idiocy and ignorance beyond a reasonable doubt. It's not about the comics, it's not about poor Miss Palin, it's about the United States, the American people, the entire world, and her stupidity and lack of ability for a position of tremendous power. She's nothing more than an overdressed figurehead chosen by a desperate old corrupt fool who would jeopardize our national interests, and compromise the integrity of our Constitution, by choosing someone who can't even recognize (in a phone conversation as transparent as saran wrap) who isn't the French president. And thinks the sum total of foreign policy preparation is looking across the water at Russia.",

Few are worthy of worship or villification.\n \n I can't wait until Wednesday.\n\n \n Jitobear, I'm glad you're voting for Obama too. With all due respect, however, it's entirely the grown-up in me, as well, that approves. I don't know the talk show or DJs in question (have you listened to their Montreal program here in the U.S.?), but our politicians are vetted by a free press -- and that includes investigative journalism, and even comedic expos\u00e9. \n \n It would be mean-spirited if the media source were conveying a false impression about the candidate in question -- for example, blatantly lying and/or making up stories about a candidate's citizenship or affiliations with terrorists. Like some of the threads started on these boards, and about Obama.\n \n It's quite another thing when the media source is revealing something truthful about a candidate\"s qualifications or lack thereof for office. The person with her on the phone, \"juvenile\" in conversation, on purpose. To show how non-cognizant the candidate is -- to the extent of not being able to recognize that, a speaker greatly greatly different than Nicolas Sarcozy, isn't him at all. \n \n What kind of characters do you think a vice president has to deal with, in terms of the VP's discriminatory faculties? They have to be prepared to deal with some very sophisticated forms of swindling. These two (relatively innocent Montreal residents) handed to Palin, on a silver platter, all kinds of clues that she was being had. That's not \"jack-XXX\" or dumb at all. \"Look! This person can't even see through the most obvious con!\" Do you want this person in the second highest office?\" Making an XXX out of the United States?\n \n They dug up exactly the kind of information the media is supposed to find. If Palin can't deal with that, either, she doesn't belong in office. It's isn't about her, it isn't about them, it's about the nation and how its interests are served by a free media. If, in addition to not seeing through the most obvious forms of deception (which was the basic point established), she can't stand the heat, she should get out of the kitchen.",
