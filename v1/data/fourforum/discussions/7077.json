   "I have a fourteen year old son and a sixteen year old daughter. I am really sick of the schools in America right now.\n Here are the problems with the schools.\n 1. Teachers are mostly democrats/liberals.\n 2. Most schools don't regulate what our children wear at school. (Kids no a day come to school in tank tops, and clothing that inspires sexual activity and things. Now, to us older men, we would love to see our lovely wives in tanktops and clothes like that. But tanktops, and spagetti straps, and miniskirts that allow you to see a girls underwear, and stuff is not acceptable. Also, guys come into school wearing tanktops that show pits and the bod, and they also wear pants that droop down their XXX that makes our kids look like bums.\n 3. Gangs are a big problem in schools anymore. Kids at schools dress in gang colors, and try to be gang bangers. Wanabee gang bangers I guess you could call them. You got kids at schools calling their gang the crips, and so on.\n 4. Drugs. Not so much in middle school and elementary schools, but in our highschools. I worry about my kids all the time. I worked at a high school once and hell, I went to one once. I know that kids like to experiment. But, drugs is not a good thing to experiment with. You got kids bringing drugs to school and getting arrested.\n 5. Kids really don't give a damn about their education anymore. Most kids atleast. They go to school to chit chat, and go to class. But if they are given homework, 76% of the time, the children just forget or don't give a damn.\n {Parents should be making their kids study an hour a night. But you got some parents in this world that wanna ly on thier XXX and not give a damn}\n 6. Hygiene. I am retired now, and I every once in a while sub for teachers that are sick. I can not tell you how many times some kids come to school with dirty hair or face, dirt covered neck or something, smell of cigarettes, have pants droping down their XXX, have snot going down their face, don't shower, have cruddy teeth that tells you the student does not brush, or reeks. Which gives you the assumption the student does not shower or use deoderant.\n Don't kids have any pride? Kids should be taking showers, using good hygiene, doing their homework, turning it in on time, and not getting involved with drugs or alcohol. They especially should not participate in gangs or gang activities.\n Now, either the kids look like s*** (have no hygene and have clothes that are full of holes and stuff) or you got girls wearing clothes that only a whore would wear. \n I have subed recently at my sons high school, and I saw a girl with a shirt that had no straps and showed her breasts.\n Kids need to care. We are becoming the stupidest nation. Kids would rather care more about family life, friends, boyfriend or girlfriend, or lay around and play videogames.\n Now ever since the Columbine incident, many high schools in America have security guards. The highschool my kids go to has seven security guards. Now, these guards should search lockers for drugs on a daily basis. School is supposed to be drug free and safe. No anger enhancing substances. \n Schools should give a dress code. I am NOT talking a dress and a blouse for girls and dress clothes for boys. But, maybe having shirts, and pants. No tank tops or shorts. Girls, no miniskirts or shirts that are so small you can see the breasts. This is uncalled for.\n But my father who is a principal of a middle school in Albequrque, says if that happened, the ACLU would come down and chew the schoold out.\n I don't know anything about the ACLU.\n Anyway, kids should not be allowed to wear that and come to school with hygene problems. \n \n My other topic of debate is the gothic trend. I think kids should not be allowed to come to school in black clothes that say things like \"Wish I were dead\" or \"Hell this or that\"\n Parents need to keep their kids from this gothic trend. Some kids are just copying people like Slipknot, and Slayer, and other people like that. But, it turns into a problem. A psychological problem. Kids might hear the music group talk about dying, and they will start doing the same. They should not be allowed to come to school in the pants with the chains danglying from them.\n What are our kids turning into? Please write me back if you disagree or agree. What can we do? What are limits on School power over our children?\n -John Milosevic",

   "1. Teachers are mostly democrats/liberals.\n\n \n Perhaps this implies something about how becoming educated changes ones outlook on life. \n \n We no longer train animals by breaking their spirit; why continue the practise upon our own children?\n \n Remember the old adage about death and taxes? To this add teenage rebellion. Dealing with it requires understanding and guile, not a clampdown. Perhaps you were an unusual teenager, but I clearly remember the ever-present sense of powerlessness and frustration; no longer young enough to believe the world exists for my benefit, yet seeing no path to the future that is not regimented by unsympathetic adults; the gradual, inexorable understanding that none of my childish dreams were going to come true. I wanted that to be someone's fault. \n \n There has to be an outlet for that frustration; some way in which young adults can express themselves in a way that is ostensibly frowned upon but tacitly tolerated. Clothing is an excellent example. By all means express your displeasure at the way teenagers dress, and complain loudly that if the ACLU wasn't there to stop you you'd have them all in nun's habits. They get to thumb their noses in fairly harmless fashion (pun very much intended) and nobody gets hurt.\n \n This might all sound a bit devious, but really it's just acknowledging human nature.

   "1. Teachers are mostly democrats/liberals.\n\n \n I don't know about you, but I have yet to have my political affiliations questioned when applying for a job, maybe because it's ILLEGAL, so IF they are all liberals that would be becuase that is who is applying.\n \n However, I am curious to know how you know that ALL the schools in the USA have only liberal teachers.\n \n \n2. Most schools don't regulate what our children wear at school. (Kids no a day come to school in tank tops, and clothing that inspires sexual activity and things. Now, to us older men, we would love to see our lovely wives in tanktops and clothes like that.

The school's in my city do. Nothing provacative, vulger and no gang colors. They even have uniforms in neighborhoods where gangs are a problem.\n \n Regarding the baggy pants - it's just fashion. As long as their undergarments don't show there is nothing more wrong with it than any other stupid fashion that has come along - from poodle skirts to bell bottoms.\n \n Sorry everyone may not wish to dress like you do.\n \n \n3. Gangs are a big problem in schools anymore. Kids at schools dress in gang colors, and try to be gang bangers. Wanabee gang bangers I guess you could call them. You got kids at schools calling their gang the crips, and so on.\n\n \n Gangs are a problem in the schools where gangs are a problem in the neighborhood and those schools take gangs very seriously. As far as the wannabes in the burbs - blame MTV, not the gangs - and unless they are packing and dealin - once again it is (a really lame) fashion statement.\n \n \n4. Drugs. Not so much in middle school and elementary schools, but in our highschools. I worry about my kids all the time. I worked at a high school once and hell, I went to one once. I know that kids like to experiment. But, drugs is not a good thing to experiment with. You got kids bringing drugs to school and getting arrested.\n\n \n Drugs are a problem - all over.\n \n \n5.

But if they are given homework, 76% of the time, the children just forget or don't give a damn.\n\n \n Like your first point, this is pretty preseumptious. Sorry you think so poorly of our youth. I am aware of several bright kids.\n \n \n{Parents should be making their kids study an hour a night. But you got some parents in this world that wanna ly on thier XXX and not give a damn}\n\n \n How about you let each parent tackle education with their child in whatever way works best for their child and not assume that everyone but you is lazy? You are pretty insulting - or are you talking about yourself as well when you talk about kids and parents these days?\n \n \n6. Hygiene. I am retired now, and I every once in a while sub for teachers that are sick. I can not tell you how many times some kids come to school with dirty hair or face, dirt covered neck or something, smell of cigarettes, have pants droping down their XXX, have snot going down their face, don't shower, have cruddy teeth that tells you the student does not brush, or reeks. Which gives you the assumption the student does not shower or use deoderant.\n\n \n More presumption BUT - \n \n Part of it is age. When my son was little he could get dirty sitting in church and there is no escaping hat head and runny noses in the winter (at least in Minnesota). Most teens super-primp. Sorry if your kids are slobs tho.\n \n \nBut my father who is a principal of a middle school in Albequrque, says if that happened, the ACLU would come down and chew the schoold out.\n\n \n Are you still in NM? Man - schools there DO suck. I used to live in Santa Fe. However - if you are still there -there is so much - cultural issues to being the poorest state in the union that all impact how the schools are run.\n \n \nMy other topic of debate is the gothic trend. I think kids should not be allowed to come to school in black clothes that say things like \"Wish I were dead\" or \"Hell this or that\"\n\n \n I agree with no vulgarity - but who are you to determine everyone else's sense of style? \n \n \nParents need to keep their kids from this gothic trend.\n \n \n Why? To appease you?\n \n \nSome kids are just copying people like Slipknot, and Slayer, and other people like that.\n\n \n Slipknot and Slayer are metal bands - not goth/industrial. At least know WHAT you are condemning. \n \n \nBut, it turns into a problem. A psychological problem. Kids might hear the music group talk about dying, and they will start doing the same. \n\n \n Good heavens - give people some credit.

I thought only liberals and democrats relied on the government to solve their problems? Or at least that is the current conservate mantra.\n \n The main problem for the schools is that the Cithgaps and other christian types, instead of staying and tying to make the schools a better place, have fled to \"homeskooling\" or private christian schools.\n Also children that have a bad home life are more concerned with survival then learning.\n \n Let this liberal and green party member give you some ideas. \n Ever heard of the PTA? Get the parents involved.\n Stop the victim mentality and try and make the school a better place. Dress codes have been in effect in public schools and are not a new idea. In general the ACLU does not have a problem with dress codes it is generally how they are inforced. If dress codes or enforced equitably I don't think anyone would have a problem with them.",

But you got some parents in this world that wanna ly on thier XXX and not give a damn}\n 6. Hygiene. I am retired now, and I every once in a while sub for teachers that are sick. I can not tell you how many times some kids come to school with dirty hair or face, dirt covered neck or something, smell of cigarettes, have pants droping down their XXX, have snot going down their face, don't shower, have cruddy teeth that tells you the student does not brush, or reeks. Which gives you the assumption the student does not shower or use deoderant.\n Don't kids have any pride? Kids should be taking showers, using good hygiene, doing their homework, turning it in on time, and not getting involved with drugs or alcohol. They especially should not participate in gangs or gang activities.\n Now, either the kids look like s*** (have no hygene and have clothes that are full of holes and stuff) or you got girls wearing clothes that only a whore would wear. \n I have subed recently at my sons high school, and I saw a girl with a shirt that had no straps and showed her breasts.\n Kids need to care. We are becoming the stupidest nation. Kids would rather care more about family life, friends, boyfriend or girlfriend, or lay around and play videogames.\n Now ever since the Columbine incident, many high schools in America have security guards. The highschool my kids go to has seven security guards. Now, these guards should search lockers for drugs on a daily basis. School is supposed to be drug free and safe. No anger enhancing substances. \n Schools should give a dress code. I am NOT talking a dress and a blouse for girls and dress clothes for boys. But, maybe having shirts, and pants. No tank tops or shorts. Girls, no miniskirts or shirts that are so small you can see the breasts. This is uncalled for.\n But my father who is a principal of a middle school in Albequrque, says if that happened, the ACLU would come down and chew the schoold out.\n I don't know anything about the ACLU.\n Anyway, kids should not be allowed to wear that and come to school with hygene problems. \n \n My other topic of debate is the gothic trend. I think kids should not be allowed to come to school in black clothes that say things like \"Wish I were dead\" or \"Hell this or that\"\n Parents need to keep their kids from this gothic trend. Some kids are just copying people like Slipknot, and Slayer, and other people like that. But, it turns into a problem. A psychological problem. Kids might hear the music group talk about dying, and they will start doing the same. They should not be allowed to come to school in the pants with the chains danglying from them.\n What are our kids turning into? Please write me back if you disagree or agree. What can we do? What are limits on School power over our children?\n -John Milosevic\nIIRC, you stated in another thread that you have quit lying. What happened?",
