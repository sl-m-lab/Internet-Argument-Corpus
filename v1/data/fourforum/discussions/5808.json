   "Well, I would say its not moral, but you also present it somewhat unfairly.\n \n The point is its punishment: this suggests that in a perfect state (ie Eden) women are equal to men, and that their subjugation is part of the Fall. It is bound up with women condemned to pain in childbirth and men condemned to pain in physical work. Basically, its a result of the need to create roles in society due to the hostile world.\n \n In Eden, nothing suggests Eve is inferior. She is sent as a 'helpmate' but this word is most often used of God as the helpmate of man. Moreover, until the creation of Eve, Adam is not referred to with a male term: there's an argument that he is only considered male when he's compared with female.",

That's just one possible interpretation.\n\n Exactly. What happened is that mankind chose to do that which was contrary to God's intentions. You can't just breakout a passage of scripture and denote it as all inclusive. Adam and Eve both made that decision and allowed sin to separate them from God. Keep reading, because God promises them a Saviour. Keep reading - Abraham was given the promise of being blessed and all nations along with him. Does this sound like all of mankind is to be cursed? And what/who was \"cursed\" anyway? The answer: Satan and the ground - not Adam and Eve. This path that they took was not the path God wanted them to take, but because of free will He allowed it. In that case a social structure had to be developed or total chaos would reign. It is not that man was to rule over women due to God's commandment, but, due to mankind's disobediance, that's the way it has to be for them. So mankind chose that path, not God. God did not make \"ruling over Eve\" a commandment for all mankind. As a matter of fact it was not a commandment at all, but an observation, so to speak.",
