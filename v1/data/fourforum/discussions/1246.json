   "Do you favor the steel tariffs that the President said he would not do but did anyway to \"save jobs\"? Should he lift them? \n \n http://www.fortwayne.com/mld/journalgazette/7234392.htm\n \n U.S. loses steel tariff trade case\n Bush response could cost him political capital\n By Paul Blustein and Jonathan Weisman\n Washington Post\n \n WASHINGTON - The World Trade Organization issued a final ruling Monday that the steel tariffs imposed by President Bush violate international trade rules, raising expectations that the White House will soon repeal the tariffs to avoid imminent European retaliation.\n \n The organization's decision gives the European Union and several other countries the right to impose retaliatory tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of American exports unless Bush reverses his March 2002 decision to give American steelmakers protection from imports. Such sanctions could be the largest ever applied in a World Trade Organization case....",

It was a job killer. How? Because many suppliers required low cost steel to manufacture \"competitive\" products. Here is an example: There is a steel barrel manufacturer. He now has to purchase high cost steel. Guess what, he now has to charge more for his barrels. Now the imported barrels are cheaper than his. So his customers now buy barrels made outside the US. \n \n Many of these small business owners are Republicans. They supported Bush for President. Now they feel betrayed. Now these rank and file Republicans are considering supporting anyone who will remove these tariffs.\n \n Most liberals prefer taxes and tariffs fit right in. Personally, I feel taxed enough. Not only are there taxes being collected by the government, I have to pay higher prices for products.",

Tariffs like any taxes are \"job killers\". I expect the tariffs to be removed within a year. \n \n For decades the steel industry have asked for \"protection\". Heck, many people thought it would save jobs. I hope we remember this lesson in the future. Let other countries tax their people with tariffs.",
