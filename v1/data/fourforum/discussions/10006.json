I would like to vote for Obama I believe he can set us on a better course, but the one thing that is stopping me from voting for him is that I will feel horrible knowing I voted for somebody who is for terminating innocent human life.\n \n Any input?\n\n \n I don't think Obama is terminating any life, innocent or otherwise, himself. That is a sensational overstatement of his position. \n \n Should he ever be in a position to have a discussion about abortion with a woman in his life, he might be personally opposed to the process in that one or in all instances. I believe, however, that he understands the decision is a very difficult one and highly dependent upon the context, and another person might come to the decision that an abortion is appropriate for her/his situation. Because of this, he feels abortion should not be made illegal, as that would make things much worse, no matter what one's personal stand on abortion is. \n \n I have no feelings for Barak or any other candidate at this time. I think Giuliani stated his position nicely:\n \n \"Where people of good faith, people who are equally decent, equally moral and equally religious, when they come to different conclusions about this, about something so very very personal, I believe you have to respect their viewpoint,\" he said. \"You give them a level of choice here.\" \n \n That's what pro-choice is about. \n \n If you say, \"Abortion. Bad. Anyone who doesn't think it should be illegal. Bad, too.\" what is there to even talk about?",

Instead, if you are so concerned about abortion, find a candidate that will minimize the number of abortions. Do some research or email the Obama election committee questioning them what he will do to minimize the number of abortions. They will likely reply after some length of time with a position letter. From that you can make an effective decision if you agree or disagree with those plans.",
