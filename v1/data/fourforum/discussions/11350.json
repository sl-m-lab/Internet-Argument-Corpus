However, it might as well be admitted that Helms was as much of a victim as the people he brutally victimised. People have to learn that kind of hatred, and one doesn't have to look far for its source in Helms's case: it's the religious, fundamentalist Southern society he was raised in. He was taught to hate blacks and gays. Perhaps he made some strides in overcoming his racism, I don't know, but he was a long way from overcoming his homophobia.",
