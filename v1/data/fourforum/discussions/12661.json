   "Pigs in flu's past, not present: The new flu can be traced to 1998 and a Newton Grove pig farm. No pigs today have been found with that strain.\n By Barbara Barrett - Washington correspondent\n Published: Sat, May. 02, 2009 02:00AM\n WASHINGTON -- The new H1N1 influenza virus that continues to spread through the United States has ancestry in a swine flu outbreak that first struck a North Carolina hog farm more than 10 years ago, according to scientists studying the strain's genetic makeup.\n \n The current strain has not shown up in surveillance of U.S. pigs, and it cannot be caught by eating pork.\n \n But the finding about its genetic background illustrates how viruses mutate and in some cases jump among species.\n\n Pigs in flu's past, not present - Local & State - News & Observer\n \n Capitalism ungoverned!\n \n Wunnerful! Wunnerful!\n \n Crowding huge numbers of swine into small spaces for profit at all costs.\n \n Wunnerful! Wunnerful!",
