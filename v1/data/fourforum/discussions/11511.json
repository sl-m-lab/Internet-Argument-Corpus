   "Oh Simone honey, didn't you learn from your Big Brother's Big Book of Learning Things More Correctly that War IS Peace?\n \n But, still, what are we to do when a nation decides to harbor self admitted terrorists who attacked your country and won't hand them over for justice? (Afghanistan)\n \n Or a nation has attacked one of your allies? (Georgia)\n \n Or, got a little too uppity for their own good?\n \n Ok, acted stupid at a time when you're seeing red and behaved like it was violating past arrangements (only hindsight shows that Iraq was probably a wasted venture...but, had Saddams WMD's been found in massive quantities...I wonder).\n \n And, lets not forget about Iraq II (possibly to be known as Iran)...hey, just because the 1st country we bashed didn't have WMD's doesn't mean the 2nd...or 3rd one won't. It's all a matter of getting it right eventually. Like playing a slot machine. Eventually it'll pay off.\n Yeah, we may eventually have to attack France just to hit pay-dirt...and that's a country KNOWN to be surly AND have WMD's!\n \n emoticon_xbouncer\n \n And I wish McCain were like Bush...\n \n But, more in the way of flipping his middle finger out for a pic.\n \n Beyond that, he's really not a lot like him.\n Other than being a white male. \n \n I mean, just study them both real hard.\n McCain has had skin cancer.\n Bush has a speach impediment.\n McCain married a young, hot, rich woman.\n Bush smoked a lot of dope and found God.\n McCain is from AZ.\n Bush is from Texas (my penis is soo small I have to live in a big state to compensate).\n McCain fought in a war and was taken POW.\n Bush smoked a lot of dope and went AWOL.\n McCain will think long and hard before pushing the nuclear button.\n Bush can't because they call it a 'football', and he tossed the case with the codes in a long pass and told a S.S. guard to go for the hail-mary. It broke before he knew what it really was...and the world was spared for another 8 years.\n \n See?\n \n Nothing alike.",

   "I hope I will tell no secret when I say that America's dominance in the world in solving its tasks by force is only a myth that was invented long ago by America's propaganda machine that never stopped working since the era of the cold war. Yes, it's only a myth that should be nailed down! Of course that's beyond dispute that the United States is good at waging hostilities but that's the best thing it can do. Washington knows well how to resort to war, but always fails to put an end to war. This problem is like a soap bubble - it grows larger and larger until it blows out. When it does, it makes a problem for every involved country. The main problem of Americans is that they fail to understand that it is not so important to totally wipe out the enemy but to stand the ground invaded. The US Army fails to do it because Washington's primary target of total control over the territory has nothing to do with what the native population is striving for - the independence. That's why the USA can actually never succeed.",
