   "This has cropped up recently in Canadian Healthcare where certain doctors are refusing to see/treat patients who despite warnings persist with unhealthy habits, specifically smoking and over-eating.\n \n What are your thoughts?\n \n Should doctors be granted the right to not waste their time? Note, that these doctors have being seeing these patients for years and the patients refuse to accept advice, and instead return with the same chronic complaints.\n \n My personal view. Despite our choices, we in Canada are entitled to fair treatment under national healthcare. That is, they should be entitled to go to the doctor and have the doctor look at them and tell them what is wrong and what needs to be done. That being said, I do understand the frustration on the part of physicians who feel that no matter what they say, patients ignore warnings. I imagine that after 35 years or so of having someone come in and complain about a dry, hacking cough while continuing to smoke a pack a day, I would suggest that the patient find a new physician.\n \n I believe that people who persist with chronic bad habits should not be entitled to transplants and be placed down the list on surgeries with wait times. Why give a lung to a smoker who has shown no desire to quit? Why give a heart to someone who refuses to take care of it?\n \n 70% of transplant failures are due to non-compliance with the physiolocial and pharmacological regimes.",

Guaranteed health coverage so to speak.\n \n I think we would agree that in case of emergency, the doctor should care for the patient regardless of such \"difficulties\".\n But in case of a non-emergency when it is possible for the patient to see another doctor? I don't know...\n \n \n \nI believe that people who persist with chronic bad habits should not be entitled to transplants and be placed down the list on surgeries with wait times. Why give a lung to a smoker who has shown no desire to quit? Why give a heart to someone who refuses to take care of it?\n 70% of transplant failures are due to non-compliance with the physiolocial and pharmacological regimes.\n\n Do you have a source for the \"70%\"?\n I tried to find it myself, and could at least verify that \"non-compliance\" makes up the majority of transplant failures. Stated so by repeated sources. But none gave a statistic.\n If you don't have it handy, don't sweat it.\n \n But on this note, I agree. If a non-smoker and a continual smoker both need the lung, it should go to the smoker. I don't know the precise standards, but the transplant organizations have rules on these issues...",

Why give an alcoholic a liver to destroy, when it could go to a non-drinker who will probably live a long and happy life with a liver transplant? Yet the system we use is nothing more than a lottery, blind to social behavior. Not right. emoticon_xdonno",
