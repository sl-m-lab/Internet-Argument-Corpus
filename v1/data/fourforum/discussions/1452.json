Theologically it was instituted by God, but man's distortion is that it is now cultural. \n \n I do think christians should lobby against things that are unhealthy for their government and the people the government serves.

Indeed, as a result of bad males behaving thus, their likely bad future wives get less than they otherwise would, the goodness of which exceeds the badness of whatever increases in mistresses the bad males might get as a result of their excessively trying to get them. \n\n \n \n Actually what you failed to do was read his premise closely enough to grasp the point he was making. He was basing his argument on biblical principals and Christian response to those principals. You failed to notice that and that is why you were confused. FYI you actually based your premise on a misstatement of fact that skewed your logic. Although slander is a sin and is very harmful, society does not deny civil rights to slanderers. A slanderer may get popped in civil court for some pocket change but a slanderer's spouse still gets their social security checks after they die. While criminal behavior is punishable by fines or imprisonment, not all behavior prohibited in the Bible is currently regarded as criminal behavior by the government. Not all criminal behavior results in a loss of civil rights enjoyed by the rest of society. Even a murderer (as long as they are heterosexual) retains the right to make a legal committment to another person and enjoy the legal rights and benefits that committment brings with it. \n \n The point Scombridae 1969 seemed to be making was that although he believes that the Bible does condemn homosexuality, there is no scriptural basis for singling out homosexuality for special treatment. With that in mind he questions why Christians would get so worked up about homosexuals while ignoring other behavior specifically and repeatedly addressed in scripture. For example in Proverbs 6:16-19 it says, \"There are six things the Lord hates, seven that are detestible to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil, a false witness who pours out lies and a man who stirs up dissention among brothers.\" Homosexuality apparently does merit a mention on this list. Divorce on the other hand is specifically and repeatedly condemned in the Old and New Testament yet you don't see Christians working to enact a constitutional amendment denying divorcees the right to remarry. Why not? \n \n How do we decide what behaviors are reprehensible and what behaviors are merely bad? As I presume you are an athiest from your posts, I find your reasoning even more perplexing. If as you seem to believe, there is no God, how do you even determine that a particular behavior is bad or reprehensible? Majority opinion? Then what about when the majority of people viewed interracial marriage as reprehensible before the laws were changed? I'll just bet that 50 years ago it would not have been difficult to find some mathematician proffering a theory on the alleged depravity of race mixing. \n \n So you tell me, how does my relationship with the woman I love harm you or anyone else? I had to draw up legal documents just to ensure that if I were hospitalized and decisions had to be made about my healthcare that my partner could be by my side and make those decisions. That is just one right married heterosexuals take for granted that is denied to same sex couples. I cannot think of any behavior that results in a heterosexual person's spouse being denied the right to collect their social security check upon their death or file their income taxes together as a couple. Adultery is clearly very harmful, yet I do not see any debate forums devoted to adulterers rights. That is because adulterers have not been denied their civil rights under the law. In fact laws against adultery have been eliminated not strengthened. Since adultery more than anything else has weakened the institution of marriage why not focus on ridding this nation of the behavior? How about some heavy criminal penalties for people who have sex without a legal and emotional commitment. Fornication leads to STD's, unwanted pregnancies and fatherless children who often without guidance, grow up to commit crimes against society. Why no debate forums discussing the rights of fornicators? Could that be because even fornicators have the right to make decisions about what is right or wrong for them. Heterosexual Christians don't seem to want the government intruding on their right to fornicate, divorce their spouses and commit adultery at will but they are intent on making sure the \"homos\" don't have basic rights. You cannot ignore the hypocrisy and remain intellectually honest.",

   "[QUOTE=Montalban] There is no debate over adulterer's rights, because adulterers aren't parading in the streets saying \"Look at us sinners - we're proud!\" \n \n \n So let me be clear. Is it your position that my partner and I do not have the same rights as an adulterer and his or her wife or husband because of gay pride parades?\n\n \n \n Not at all. You have the same legal rights as anyone else. The question was put why of all the sins do 'we Christians' seem to concentrate on gays? I answered because most of the other sins, when committed, the people don't boast about it. If there were to be an \"Extortioner's Pride\" parade, if it's legal, then they'd have the same rights as you or I. Only gays seem to think that they should have pride in their sinning.\n \n \n Same with other sins; theft, robbery, murder, child molestation, bestiality. \n\n \n \n What about pride and arrogance, Montalban?\n\n \n These too are sins. Although I do post here, and my posts are tinged with arrogance, I need to set the record 'straight' if you'll excuse my pun.\n \n \n How does God feel about a haughty man who would claim to own the Bible and the sole right to interpret the Bible?\n\n \n I don't personally hold that I own the Bible. My Church put it together. That's a fact. That you want to argue from ignorance of history, is I would suggest, tinged with arrogance too.\n \n \n How does God feel about a man who would try to place a stumbling block between a believer and his or her God?\n\n \n I expect God might not be to happy. Tell me who has done this, and how they have done it?\n \n \n The sins you have mentioned have nothing to do with homosexuality. However, arrogance is right up there with bestiality and child molestation. Check Proverbs 6:16-19 haughtiness is detestable to God.\n\n \n Yes, it is a sin. Are you suggesting then that it would be less so, if I were to have a 'Haughtiness pride' parade? Your argument has self-destructed here because...\n \n \n Please take note, my deep love for a wonderful woman is not mentioned.\n\n \n Indeed, and neither is robbery, by extension of your logic then, robbery's okay. You are quite funny, your argument is by using a verse of the Bible! You believe this to be literally true, but then you choose the condemnations of homosexuality to be 'non-literal'. You've just discredited yourself from using the Bible as a source, because you personally pick and choose which ones suite you.\n \n \n However, one group thinks it is special - homosexuals. \n\n \n \nAdulater's rights are not debated because their rights are not abridged.\n\n \n Not so. If I commit adultery, my right to privacy would be attacked; why should my partner be informed? If I was a celeb, then the whole world would know. My rights to property would be under threat with an up-coming divorce in which my adultery would be one of the elements factored into any settlement. Christian nut-cases :) would hound me. Women's groups would condemn me.\n \n \nWhat special right am I asking for?\n\n \n Apart from the right to re-write the Bible? But then you're not just about moral rights... you're on now a different debate.. legal rights...\n \n \nThe right at the age of eighty not to be kept from the bedside of my partner of 50 years because I failed to have a lawyer draw up papers establishing my legal rights. Or how about the right to make decisions for her if she were incapacitated without having visited a lawyer first. Or how about the right to remain in the home I shared with my partner for 50 years after she dies intestate without fighting a distant cousin for it. Or how about my partner's right to collect the social security I have paid for after my death, as a heterosexual wife would have the right to do?\n\n \n How is the Church (any Church) effectively blocking this? Do you not have separation of Church and State?\n \n \nHow about a little original intellectual honesty? Special rights would be if I wanted the right to buy a home at a special low homosexual interest rate. Or if I wanted the right to attend college free under a special government grant for homosexuals. My partner and I don't want anything that you and every other heterosexual takes for granted when they make a permanent commitment to someone. \n\n \n In this country, you could claim special advantages to employment through reverse discrimination legislation.\n \n \nNot all homosexuals march in gay pride parades. Sadly, most live a life of lies lest they offend. You think of homosexuality as a sexual act. I cannot speak for all, but my relationship is the result of love and respect for a woman I intend to spend the rest of my life with. Intimacy is as it should be, an expression of my love for her.\n\n \n The first sentence is a truism, therefore hollow. The second is an opinion. The third is conjecture about what you think I think. The next are statements of fact as related to your own life.\n \n \nWhat you do, is, up to you. But it is clearly spoken of in the Bible and in the Holy Tradition of the Church. How God decides to act when you sin against His plan, that too is not for me to say. \n\n \n \nDo not get lost in meaningless religious ritual because it is emotionally gratifying, entertaining and easy. \n\n \n You've never been to an Orthodox Liturgy. They are not 'entertaining'. If I was to stray towards critical, they'd be classed as boring. They are not there for my own self-enjoyment. They are there because I am supposed to act to show my love for God, by following His commandment \"Do this in memory of me\".\n \n (The Liturgy involves no musical instruments, no jumping up and leaping about, no clapping of hands etc.) Our Liturgy itself, dates to the 300s. But then, of course you are willing to condemn it, because ignorance is bliss.\n \n \nChristianity offers so much more. \n\n \n More than fulfilment? Orthodoxy isn't about re-writing the Bible to suit your own personal lifestyle choices. Orthodoxy, as the name suggests, is the 'orthodox' or 'original' form of worship. Look at the Didache, written in 120 AD, it talks of the Eucharist - the celebration of the Body of Christ. This was a practice that pre-dates the Bible. That goes to show you that the very first Christians practiced it. Most Protestants just have some symbolic gathering together, which is not what the people who knew Christ did. But hey, if it 'cramps your style' don't worry.\n \n \nAttending the local church is mandated but God also expects us to seek knowledge of Him through the study of His Word under the enabling power of the Holy Spirit and through prayer. I will pray for you Montalban, there is a richer spiritual life waiting for you out there. God wants to have a close personal relationship with you and not just your priest. Seek and you will find.\n\n \n Pray all you want. I don't doubt the power of prayer. The laughable statement you made about a 'close personal relationship' shows that you've chosen to ignore the richness of liturgical worship.\n \n Your form of 'personalised' Christianity, that allows for everything that you want, is not true. St. Paul continually urged the various Christian communities to stop going it their own way.",

It's such an odd way of putting your statement, in a valiant attempt to gloss over the fact that it is mentioned as a sin.\n \n Another way of looking at it: \"Sure the Bible mentions it as a sin, but because it's hardly ever, let's pretend it's never\".\n \n \nMontalban, as you will find, is Orthodox, so he doesn't rely in the Bible as much as his \"Holy Tradition\"..\n\n \n It is \"Holy Tradition\", or \"Orthodox Holy Tradition\" not \"Montalban's Holy Tradition\"\n \n The odd thing is, the quote from Proverbs made by your colleague is by someone who relies on the Bible, part-time. She chooses Proverbs as a literal interpretation, but ones condeming homosexuality must be metaphors or some such rot.",

Just as you can be labelled a \"theif\" even if you had once incident of stealing. I'm not sure at what point the label \"homosexual\" gets stuck to you, if its after one incident or a habitual occurence\n \n anyway, the way I see it, homosexuals, theives, alcoholic, etc are just people that failed to conform to God's law. that doesnt mean they cannot be pardoned if they repent. and it doesnt mean that law keepers cannot break the law. the options never go away. just the people decide to take either option",

Why did god create it in such a way?\n \n I think ive asked this question to somebody else, why is god being selective as to who is homosexual.\n \n If someone is homosexual, then they are more likely to sin, or should i say tempted to sin. But we are not all homosexual, why does god make it difficult to only a few and not too all. We can all kill if we wish thus becoming murderers, we can all lie thus becoming liars, but we cant all be homosexual or participate in such a sexual act, it has to be within you.\n \n So you can say god is fair in one way by making us all possible liars and its upto us to choose whether we \"sin\" or not, but on the other hand he is selective as to who he makes homosexual. So why is he so selective?\n\n I think you have it backwards... you are not homosexual, and as a result you sin. its really you commit the sin, and then you are labelled \"homosexual\". I hope you are not implying that homosexuality is a trait people are born with. homosexuality is a choice.

Sins are transgressions against God's law. However, when the bible uses the word sin (singular) it is referring to a nature, a thing, and entity all of its own.\n \n What we have been discussing is actually the latter and not the former. It is Sin that causes us to commit sins. It is the sin nature. Everyone has one. You are correct though that the choice does not go away. The choice however, is not \"whether or not to transgress the law of God.\" It is rather, the choice to submit to God (who lives in those who believe) or to submit to the sin nature. Obedience is not to a set of rules. Rules never made anyone keep them. Obedience is to a person. Who do you choose to obey? You will choose to obey the one you trust. You can trust yourself (which will lead in the wrong direction) or You can trust the one who knows all and made all and is loving, kind, merciful, and graceful. THAT is the choice.",

Why be proud of something you've no choice in? Why be proud of a compulsion? That is in fact what the 'nature' argument is proposing.

Whatever \"naturalistic state\" you are talking about, it seems beside the point.\n\n \n Whilst people are born with the appearance of being black, he is suggesting that there is some inherent quality that they are born with that goes deeper than them being superficially black.\n \n To me there is no inherent 'blackness' about a person. If you feel that there is, then you are being racist - you are attributing characteristics (other than physical) to being black.\n \n In fact, he said it is a characteristic similar to being born homosexual. And therefore, you can't fight against nature. Whatever 'attributes' you are born with, that's it. In fact, you'd be wrong to try to fight against it.\n \n \n It's easy to despise people who have principles, and stand by them.\n\n \n \nEspecially if their supposed \"principles\" are just self-interest and bigotry.\n\n \n Really, what self-interest is there for condemning homosexuality? It would be eminently more popular to have a cult saying screw anything that breathes.\n \n \nI'm interested to know because you seem to believe that gays are automatons that are compelled to be gay regardless of anything else. You're denying them choice... which is the gift from God (which we call Free Will).\n\n \n \nIs heterosexuality not innate? If so, does that make heterosexuals automatons denied of Free Will? Are you compelled to be heterosexual, despite the potential for fulfilling and happy relationships with other men?\n\n \n You don't know what feelings I have. However, your question would be better written 'is normal behaviour innate?' The decision I have made in my life is my decision. I will not say it's the influence of gravity, or DNA, or whatever. I am an adult and take responsibility for my actions. You do not, you believe you are compelled to - that it's in your nature, and that you won't fight nature.\n \n \nNo, our relationships, gay or straight, are not solely matters of compulsion for many or most in long-term relationships.(...)There are more options than the two you give us in this false dilemma.\n\n \n \nDon't worry, JakeCJB, it really is just montalban setting up a false dichotomy- a logical fallacy, BTW.\n This nature/nurture debate is tired. Sexuality is too complex to come exclusively from genes or from environment. That it has a genetic component seems likely- especially given differences in brain chemistry.\n\n \n Then you are compelled to be that. If it's brain chemistry. You'd like to have two exclusive arguments, one that it's natural, the other that you have made a choice. Any feeling you have for your partner, is just chemicals. It's like you're living a life that's a giant 'trip'.\n \n \nThe incest issue is a red herring. Incest is a term that relates to the relationship between two people- that is, familial. Not at all the same thing as your sexual orientation. Apples and oranges.\n\n \n Not at all, incest is an attraction between two people. JackCJB says that one of the reasons he supports homosexuality is that they feel an attraction between two people. He brought it up as a defence. If you are taking this away, then you are being judgemental that the attraction felt between one pairing is valid, and another is not. You are making that decision, so is he, based on what?\n \n I am basing it on whether it's God's Will or not. You arbitrarily have declared some loving unions good, others bad, based on what?\n \n If there's a dichotomy, it's you who's created it by declaring the two (homosexuality and incest) separate.",

Mizmaxx brought up a few other characteristics which have some degree of being innate.\n \n \nYou don't know what feelings I have.

If the second, how did you make the decision to be attracted exclusively to women? Did you make the decision to be attracted to both men and women, then make another decision to be attracted exclusively to women?\n \n \n \nThen you are compelled to be that. If it's brain chemistry.

JackCJB says that one of the reasons he supports homosexuality is that they feel an attraction between two people. He brought it up as a defence.\n\n \n Homosexuality is an attraction between two people. Heterosexuality is an attraction between two people as well.

Few of the characteristics we are born with are not malleable to various degrees. The question is whether these characteristics should be suppressed or not. I don't think that the qualities and tastes we have should be changed just because others don't like them. Which is not the same as others being harmed by them.\n \n \nFor you, you're either born with it, or tough luck.\n\n \n I don't know where you're getting this from.

Being black means different things to different people, but certainly race is more than the physical characteristics that people seperate into false racial categories.

Whatever 'attributes' you are born with, that's it. In fact, you'd be wrong to try to fight against it.\n\n \n Actually, it's the opposite. You can fight nature, but that is often the wrong path. I know from experience how hard it is not to be influenced to try to hide one's race and appear more \"white\". Why do you think there is such a huge market for hair straighteners and skin bleaches and cosmetic surgeries (such as the eyelid surgeries people get in East Asian countries to make their eyes look \"white\"? I also know how damaging it can be, physically and psychologically, to try to be something you are not, to hide in needless and inappropriate shame. I think it's a very accurate metaphor. \n \n Anyway, looking at the results of supposed \"conversion therapies\", it is obvious that these do not work. So, in essence, although anti-gay religious groups claim to be able to \"convert\" people to heterosexuality, the truth is that the choice is one between one's happiness and true being, and a miserable existence of self-denial.\n \n \n\"There is no documentary evidence showing someone's sexual preference can be changed by therapy. There is only anecdotal evidence, mostly from the therapists themselves, claiming that what they do works. That's not very scientific. On the other hand, there's no scientific evidence to show that this is impossible...It hasn't been studied.\" Dr. Robert Spitzer, professor of psychiatry at Columbia University.

Please try to stick to things I actually said for the purposes of the debate.\n\n \n That's a paraphrasing of your 'essentialist' argument about being born with the essentials of being gay, and that this can't/shouldn't be altered as you grow.\n \n \n Whilst people are born with the appearance of being black, he is suggesting that there is some inherent quality that they are born with that goes deeper than them being superficially black. \n\n \n \n I don't think so. Being black means different things to different people, but certainly race is more than the physical characteristics that people separate into false racial categories. It is also the experience of being labelled thus in the world.\n\n \n Jake was the one who drew the analogy between being black, to being homosexual. That you are born this way and that there's no change to it, or that you shouldn't change.\n \n This is an essentialist argument again, and in this context racist. That: there are immutable characteristics attributed to being black. He's not just talking physical, he's dealing holistically. I am upset by this argument because although a black person can't naturally change his/her black appearance, they can be anything they want to be depending upon upbringing and opportunity.\n \n I don't believe that there are characteristics attributed to race, other than physical. Physical characteristics do have an influence on how you grow - if you've got a handicap, it might interfere with forming social interactions.\n \n \n In fact, he said it is a characteristic similar to being born homosexual. And therefore, you can't fight against nature. Whatever 'attributes' you are born with, that's it. In fact, you'd be wrong to try to fight against it. \n\n \n \n Actually, it's the opposite. You can fight nature, but that is often the wrong path.\n\n \n Yes, he said if you are born with 'black' characteristics, you shouldn't interfere with them, by inference as you shouldn't with homosexuality. But again, if you deny influence, then what's there to fear about change?\n \n \n I know from experience how hard it is not to be influenced to try to hide one's race and appear more \"white\". Why do you think there is such a huge market for hair straighteners and skin bleaches and cosmetic surgeries (such as the eyelid surgeries people get in East Asian countries to make their eyes look \"white\"? I also know how damaging it can be, physically and psychologically, to try to be something you are not, to hide in needless and inappropriate shame. I think it's a very accurate metaphor.\n\n \n I am not well versed in the world of cosmetics. However, you are denying these people free will again, that they are compelled to buy things. There's some ethereal force behind this, making people unhappy, and getting them to change.\n \n \n \nAnyway, looking at the results of supposed \"conversion therapies\", it is obvious that these do not work. So, in essence, although anti-gay religious groups claim to be able to \"convert\" people to heterosexuality, the truth is that the choice is one between one's happiness and true being, and a miserable existence of self-denial.\n\n \n Are you saying that people shouldn't be happy?\n \n \n \n \"There is no documentary evidence showing someone?s sexual preference can be changed by therapy. There is only anecdotal evidence, mostly from the therapists themselves, claiming that what they do works. That?s not very scientific. On the other hand, there?s no scientific evidence to show that this is impossible...It hasn?t been studied.\" Dr. Robert Spitzer, professor of psychiatry at Columbia University. In 2001, after he made this statement, he reported on a study that he had made. It indicated that reparative therapy has as a failure rate on the order of 99.98% \n\n \n I don't understand this, if the subject's not been studied, how do they know the failure rate?\n \n \n PS\n I will be less responsive to all posts on all subjects as my access to the internet is temporarily restricted. I apologise if this finds you expecting well-deserved apologies etc. :)",

The subject of the debate is whether homosexuality is morally acceptable, therefore using an agreed morally unacceptable action as a metaphor is not compelling.\n \n \nPerhaps you believe that sexual attraction really is just a chemical reaction, \n\n \n I've already stated that I believe it to be a complex process involving emotion and biology.

That doesn't answer my question, though.\n \n \nInterestingly that you seem the only person in the world never influenced in your development. What is you 'mizmaxx' must have been totally there when you were born.\n\n \n I never said that at all. I would like to know how without any gay role models and two happily married parents (in both mine and the other girl's case) you could argue that we were more influenced to be experimenting homosexually than heterosexually. Especially given the tremendous and constant anti-homosexual messages we received.\n \n \nPerhaps you are unaware of the societal factors in your life.\n\n \n Perhaps.

Besides, I said these characteristics should not be influenced away without reason. I do not believe children are born a \"clean-slate\" (as per John Locke), neither do I believe that nothing can be learned or changed. \n \n \nThat's a paraphrasing of your 'essentialist' argument about being born with the essentials of being gay, and that this can't/shouldn't be altered as you grow.\n\n \n No, it is you creating a straw man out of my argument.\n \n \nJake was the one who drew the analogy between being black, to being homosexual. That you are born this way and that there's no change to it, or that you shouldn't change.\n\n \n Indeed, you should not attempt to pretend you are not black if that is what you are. As I said, you cannot change your heritage. Being black as a \"race\" however has to do with an experience of racism, not genetics, but because racism frames race as genetic, experience of racism is affected by genetics. \n \n \nI am upset by this argument because although a black person can't naturally change his/her black appearance, they can be anything they want to be depending upon upbringing and opportunity.\n\n \n Of course they can. That will not change the reality that they experience the world as a black person.\n \n \nI don't believe that there are characteristics attributed to race, other than physical. Physical characteristics do have an influence on how you grow - if you've got a handicap, it might interfere with forming social interactions.\n\n \n You don't believe that there are social characteristics to the experience of race- ie racism? As for your \"handicap\" argument, I could argue this point as well, since most disabilities are more socially than physically created. However, as I said before, I think this whole off-topic issue of your accusation of Jake being racist is a big stinky red herring.\n \n \nYes, he said if you are born with 'black' characteristics, you shouldn't interfere with them, by inference as you shouldn't with homosexuality. But again, if you deny influence, then what's there to fear about change?\n\n \n Well, you can't change being homosexual or black, but you can hide and pretend. That is what I believe Jake was arguing against, not changing but pretending, hiding, in the closet, etc. Incidentally, my XXXXX friends of colour use the same language (\"out\") for when people tell others that they are XXXXX as when someone who \"passes\" (again XXXXX language) as white tells people and/or becomes vocal about being a person of colour. So evidently there are many people of colour who do not find the comparison racist.\n \n \nHowever, you are denying these people free will again, that they are compelled to buy things. There's some ethereal force behind this, making people unhappy, and getting them to change.\n\n \n I am not denying anyone \"Free Will\", I am showing how they are influenced to make their decisions. In my experience racism is not at all an ethereal force. \n \n \nAre you saying that people shouldn't be happy?\n\n \n Are you being sarcastic?\n \n \nI don't understand this, if the subject's not been studied, how do they know the failure rate\n\n \n Perhaps the sentence was unclear. It hasn't been studied whether it is impossible to change someone's sexual orientation, but all studies of attempts to do so show that they are overwhelming failures. The study done by Dr. Spitzer involved organizations that claimed to have \"changed\" people into heterosexuals, and volunteers who claimed to have been made heterosexual through such programs. \n \n Thus, in practice, saying that people try to be heterosexual is dooming them to failure, and thus in many people's eyes, Hell. The only options you are offering homosexuals is unhappiness or damnation.\n \n \nGirlEsq...\n I would like to take a short pause in the debate to stand up and thank you.

Rapture, you remind my of Homer J Simpson, who's always on about killing Ned Flanders, even when he's writing a restaurant review, he repeated \"Kill Flanders\" over and over again at the end. Your anti-Catholic obsession is becoming famous.\n \n \nSo, you're (sic) argument then is based on demography and statistics; that if a certain threshold of people believe it to be an amoral issue, it is. \n\n \n \nNot at all. I was merely pointing out that his (?) analogy does not make a compelling argument. The subject of the debate is whether homosexuality is morally acceptable, therefore using an agreed morally unacceptable action as a metaphor is not compelling.\n\n \n I lost my train of thought hear :) I shouldn't have left it so long.\n \n \nPerhaps you believe that sexual attraction really is just a chemical reaction, \n\n \n \nI've already stated that I believe it to be a complex process involving emotion and biology. I was inquiring as to where you believe these feelings come from. \n\n \n We have love from God which radiates. Hate is just the absence of love. It is caused by sin shutting off God's love.\n \n \n Parents and to a lesser extent other adults such as teachers are a major influence on a child(...) \n\n \n \nI studied Early Childhood Education, believe me, I know. That doesn't answer my question, though.\n\n \n Interesting. I studied Sociology. There are some theorists who believe actions are up to the individual, such as Emile Durkheim's classic argument re: suicide, however a vast majority of theorists emphasise social factors as influences... Plotter for instance declares that religious hatreds cause gay suicides... thus a negative reaction.\n \n \nInterestingly that you seem the only person in the world never influenced in your development. What is you 'mizmaxx' must have been totally there when you were born. \n\n \n \nI never said that at all. I would like to know how without any gay role models and two happily married parents (in both mine and the other girl's case) you could argue that we were more influenced to be experimenting homosexually than heterosexually. Especially given the tremendous and constant anti-homosexual messages we received.\n\n \n Same-sex orientation is a natural part of growing up. (not saying this must lead to sex), as boys and girls discover their own relationships to their own sexuality, and those of others.\n \n A boy might mistake these feelings as love, and continue to experiment, instead of following the normal path and moving to hetero orientations. It is a phase most people move out of. Some have a retarded episode in their life and don't move on.\n \n Further, there are growing societal influences suggesting that instead of progressing, that these first feelings are just as valid as any others, and that he should continue to experiment with them.\n \n \n Perhaps you are unaware of the societal factors in your life. \n\n \n \n Perhaps. Since there is no conclusive evidence that parental influence creates homosexuality, however, all you have is conjecture.\n\n \n Families are but a part of society. There are other ones; peers, society in general - idols etc. Sociologists makes studies about these all the time.\n \n \n You've now contradicted your statement above about influence from adults.\n You are arguing;\n -there's characteristics that we're born with\n -these might be influenced, BUT that they shouldn't be \n\n \n \n I don't think this is contradictory. Besides, I said these characteristics should not be influenced away without reason. I do not believe children are born a \"clean-slate\" (as per John Locke), neither do I believe that nothing can be learned or changed. \n\n \n I don't believe in the 'tabula rasa' model either. There is a combination of things. Clearly homosexuality is a sin, and therefore it is not without 'reason' that I argue against it.\n \n Further, it's not 'normal', as most people progress through this stage.\n \n \n That's a paraphrasing of your 'essentialist' argument about being born with the essentials of being gay, and that this can't/shouldn't be altered as you grow. \n\n \n \n No, it is you creating a straw man out of my argument.\n\n \n This is one I don't follow. One of the things I didn't read when I skimmed your post.\n \n \nPlotter was the one who drew the analogy between being black, to being homosexual. That you are born this way and that there's no change to it, or that you shouldn't change. \n\n \n \nIndeed, you should not attempt to pretend you are not black if that is what you are. As I said, you cannot change your heritage. Being black as a \"race\" however has to do with an experience of racism, not genetics, but because racism frames race as genetic, experience of racism is affected by genetics. \n\n \n This is not what I'm saying. I'm saying that there are physical attributes to being black. Ploter is suggesting that homosexuality and blackness are the same. Homosexuality is not a physical trait, as far as I'm aware (but even if it is, it's more; thus he's suggesting that blackness is more than being physical). Hence his racist argument; attributing other aspects to being black, by implication of his analogy\n \n \n I am upset by this argument because although a black person can't naturally change his/her black appearance, they can be anything they want to be depending upon upbringing and opportunity. \n\n \n \nOf course they can. That will not change the reality that they experience the world as a black person.\n\n \n I don't doubt that people react to their physical attributes in negative ways, and therefore this imprints a particular experience on the person, the same as any other bias, including upon gays. But I don't think that this negates their own personal choices on how they act. Further, and most important is that these negative imprints about blacks are based only on the bias person perceiving that there are essential characteristics to being black (perhaps stereotyping black people as having less mental capacity etc - which is wrong). I'm against this essentialism that Plotter is making.\n \n \nI don't believe that there are characteristics attributed to race, other than physical. Physical characteristics do have an influence on how you grow - if you've got a handicap, it might interfere with forming social interactions. \n\n \n \nYou don't believe that there are social characteristics to the experience of race- i.e. racism? As for your \"handicap\" argument, I could argue this point as well, since most disabilities are more socially than physically created. However, as I said before, I think this whole off-topic issue of your accusation of Plotter being racist is a big stinky red herring.\n\n \n I don't believe it is. He's made an analogy. I think it's false. You don't. You're defending his 'essentialist' argument.\n \n I also don't deny that the handicapped disadvantages may be simply the products of the minds of the 'able-bodied.' I am not making an essentialist argument about the handicapped either.\n \n However, homosexuality is not in the same category. When a baby is born black, or disabled, you know it. Homosexuality is a disability formed by the bad influences of society, and the convincing of the individual not to execute his/her sound judgment and Free Will.\n \n \n Yes, he said if you are born with 'black' characteristics, you shouldn't interfere with them, by inference as you shouldn't with homosexuality. But again, if you deny influence, then what's there to fear about change? \n\n \n \n Well, you can't change being homosexual or black, but you can hide and pretend. That is what I believe Plotter was arguing against, not changing but pretending, hiding, in the closet, etc. Incidentally, my XXXXX friends of colour use the same language (\"out\") for when people tell others that they are XXXXX as when someone who \"passes\" (again XXXXX language) as white tells people and/or becomes vocal about being a person of colour. So evidently there are many people of colour who do not find the comparison racist.\n\n \n No, they are different qualities; blackness and homosexuality. There is no 'essentialist' characteristic to being black (other than physical), now you're making the same racist analogy. Whilst a black person can't change the physical attributes, they can change/better themselves. You're suggesting that they can't. They're stuck with whatever attributes they are born with, and shouldn't change them.\n \n A homosexual person can cease being homosexual. I know a guy who used to date women, slept with them etc, he's now gay. He changed to being gay. If you can go to gay, you can go from gay. His ephemeral relationships are proof.\n \n Further, black people can be anything from drug dealer to surgeon, the same as white people, etc.\n \n \n However, you are denying these people free will again, that they are compelled to buy things. There's some ethereal force behind this, making people unhappy, and getting them to change. \n\n \n \n I am not denying anyone \"Free Will\", I am showing how they are influenced to make their decisions. In my experience racism is not at all an ethereal force.\n\n \n I don't doubt it. That's because they're making the same essentialist arguments you are! You believe that there's qualities to being black. So do they, only there ideas are all negative, and are just as misplaced as yours; simply because the person appears different.\n \n \nAre you saying that people shouldn't be happy? \n\n \n \nAre you being sarcastic?\n\n \n Not in the least.\n \n \nI don't understand this, if the subject's not been studied, how do they know the failure rate \n\n \n \n Perhaps the sentence was unclear. It hasn't been studied whether it is impossible to change someone's sexual orientation, but all studies of attempts to do so show that they are overwhelming failures. The study done by Dr. Spitzer involved organizations that claimed to have \"changed\" people into heterosexuals, and volunteers who claimed to have been made heterosexual through such programs. \n Thus, in practice, saying that people try to be heterosexual is dooming them to failure, and thus in many people's eyes, Hell. The only options you are offering homosexuals is unhappiness or damnation.\n\n \n I am not trying to be difficult, do you mean that you are saying that simply because all the cases have been shown to be failures, you're still not ruling out the possibility? If so, its rather generous on your part.\n \n I am not offering them damnation, anymore than asking Charles Manson to stop wanting to kill. To stop sinning.\n \n \n GirlEsq...\n I would like to take a short pause in the debate to stand up and thank you. I applaud your ability to stand up and state your opinion. \n\n \n \nHear, hear! \n\n \n I too applaud people being able to express their opinion. Only if they recognise that's all it is. GirlEsq has made statements re: Bible with little understanding of traditional beliefs. GirlEsq believes that if she can interpret the Bible in one way, to suit her, it's valid.\n \n \n Murder is seen as wrong in some cultures and not in others \n\n \n \n I suppose that depends on how you define murder. In which case, murder is okay in the US, because you have the death penalty. In any case, I am talking about the use of that metaphor as a compelling argument in this debate. Which it is not, as noone here is saying that murder is okay.\n\n \n I don't know what you were arguing here, but I spot a error of logic, Mizmaxx...\n His point is not refuted by you, as it is still true that murder is seen wrong in some cultures even if you state one that believes it's okay. You've just stated one that sees it as right. This doesn't disprove that some see it as wrong, such as in Australia :)",

   "how is your grandfather worse off being ambidexterous than left-handed? I never said that one is right or one is wrong, I said either can be learned, either can be done if the person chooses. it is possible to train your left hand to be just as dexterous as your right, as you just demonstrated. even if he wasnt forced, your grandfather could have taught himself to use the other hand by his own choice.\n\n My point is that he never chose to train his left-hand to be the dexterous one. The left-handedness is a natural trait for a particular number of people whether they like it or not. If you want to deny this fact then I'd like to see some conclusive evidence that prove it's simply people's choice. Its would be ground-breaking research since the scientific community have already concluded that it is not a learned behavior. \n \n \nLine, anyone can feel sexual attraction to members of the same sex, even me, even you. \n\n Yet another claim with no substantiation. Bisexuals may be able to switch over to homosexuality, I'm willing to accept it. But to say any heterosexual can have homosexual feeling is absurd. Heterosexual men I know who are pro-homosexuals say that the actual thought of two men having sex makes their skin crawl. That's their honest feeling. FYI, I'm a lesbian and I never have sexual feeling for men. \n \n \nit has nothing to do with genes, biology or physiology. it has a lot to do with psychology though, I agree. but there is no evidence that homosexuals are born with this feeling, nor anybody born with any feelings. people create their own psychology, based on their experience and beliefs. your psychology about your sexuality affects the way you behave. but noone has been able to link psychology to physicality, nor can you look at the physical, biological or genetic composition of a person and predict their behavior.\n\n There are also numerous studies dealing with autism and no one knows for sure the causes but the research all appears to going in the direction of a biologic explanation. Knowledge of the human brain and the human physiology can be used to provide compelling theories on particular traits or behaviors. Just because we can't find a particular gene responsible for a feature or trait does not mean it is not biological.\n \n \nbelieve me, it would be nice if such a pattern could be found... imagine isolating a terrorist gene...\n \n it just doesnt exist. and sources that state they have found a link are misleading and untruthful\n\n There is no conclusive proof also that homosexuality is chosen or based on environment. That's why experts are still researching the subject. If there is absolutely no way that it is genetic, the scientific community would know by now and wouldn't bother to be studying it, and there would be no debate about it. \"We haven't found it yet\" does not equate to \"It does not exist\". If there is no biological basis at all for sexual orientation, then one would expect that the correlation between twins would be no different in identical twins as in fraternal twins. So why is there a higher degree of correlation between identical twins (52%) than fraternal twins(22%)? Furthermore, researchers have provided biological reasons why identical twins are not always concordant for the trait under investigation. Studies of discordant identical twins (one gay, one straight) show that the number of fingerprint ridges are left-shifted (i.e., there are more ridges on the left hand than on the right hand) in the gay twin as compared with the straight brother. Because fingerprint ridges are determined in the second trimester of pregnancy, such differences have a biological basis. The reasons for these differences remain unknown, but they cannot be due to post-natal environmental factors. I see no reason to suspect that the researchers conducting these studies are not objective and it is wrong to say that there is no evidence implicating biological or fetal development. There is quite a bit of such evidence. Even the CRG article that you provided states: \"Sexual orientation, like any other human behavior, is experienced in complex and variable ways, which are undoubtedly influenced by both biological and societal factors.\" Why couldn't something as complex as human sexuality have complex causation? We don't have to believe there's just one reason people are gay-- it seems too simplistic to me. And there is a distinction between saying that X is caused by biological factors, and saying that there is an individual gene specifically responsible for X.",

Literature and music are full of this theme among heterosexuals.\n \n \nfirst of all, why arent all identical twins correlated, given they have identical genetic, biological and physical composition?\n\n \n Genes have a quality called \"penetrance\", which is a measure of their effectiveness or power. The penetrance of the gene which causes Type 1 diabetes is 30%. Both twins would have a 30% chance of developing diabetes. This could indicate that something in the environment is a trigger. It would be difficult to know what exactly the trigger was, and to be able to guarantee prevention. Of course, homosexuality is not a harmful disease, and there is no need to try to possibly in some cases prevent it, even if we could figure out the precise trigger(s). This doesn't seem to be the purpose of scientific research, and with more acceptance happening, it seems less likey that it would be used to try to find a \"cure\" for homosexuality. That is, if a \"cure\" to non-harmful homosexuality, could even be found. It does seem to be used an excuse by some gays and lesbians, when in fact, homosexuality does not need to be excused. \n \n There is no research into a heterosexuality gene, of course. Heterosexuals are just told to accept their heterosexuality, their love. Increasingly, homosexuals are being told the same thing. If we found a gene that caused love in general, perhaps the mystery and romance would be taken out of it. It is not just a biological function for anyone. The fact that it is not, does not make it good or bad.",

Such models may differ in their specific view of human development but all share the basic assumption that  humans move through life experiences within a particular framework. This framework provides a means by which one can understand the process an individual is experiencing and also to predict what form future stages might take. In addition, an awareness of these stages enables the individual to gauge her or his relation to other individuals who are having or have had similar experiences\"\n http://www.ppct.org/education/curr/tackling/tackling28.htm\n \n Everyone knows we go through stages in development.

That is far worse, as the consequences are eternal.\n \n Anyway...\n Here's a classic example of people with a sexual-political agenda trying to use science to convince people that heterosexuality is wrong...\n In the early 1970s a group of radical feminists went so far as to use science to suggest that it was physically impossible for a woman to achieve sexual orgasm whilst having penetrative sex (with a man). Even if the woman claimed to have experienced an orgasm from such sex, she was said to be deceiving her self.... \"That even in a woman's sexuality, there is deceit on the part of men, and complacency on the part of some women\" in Koedt, A. \"The Myth of Vaginal Orgasm.\" in Koedt, A. & Levine, E. & Rapone, A., (eds.). (1973). \"Radical Feminism\". Quadrangle Books, New York, p204 They had a vast amount of scientific data to back them up, including physiology that showed that position of the clitoris made it impossible for it to be stimulated by penetrative sex. (There's also an interesting article in it called \"Man hating\").\n Telling people that normal is abnormal, and abnormal is normal has happened for some time.\n \n \n RE: TRADITION...\n As an example of Holy Tradition at work, I gave a list of thinkers who've commented on Marriage...\n Gregory of Nyssa (331-95)\n John Chrysotomon (347-407)\n The Desert Fathers (4th-5th centuries)\n Isaiah the SOlitary (5th century)\n Diadochos of Photike (5th century)\n Dorotheos of Gaza (6th century)\n Gregory the Great (540-604)\n Theodor the Ascetic (7th century)\n Maximos the Confessor (580-662)\n Thaslassios the Libyan (7th century)\n Dionysios the Areopagite (c.500)\n John Klimakos (579-649)\n Symeon the New Theologian (949-1022)\n Nicholas Kavasilas (1322-96)\n Symeon of Thessalonika (d.1429)\n Dimitri of Rostov (1651-1709)\n Macarius of Optino (1788-1860)\n Ignatius Brianchaninov (1807-67)\n John of Kronstad (1829-1908)\n Silouan of Athos (1866-1938)\n Alexander Elchaninov (1881-1934)\n Kallistos of Diokleia (b.1934)\n list taken from \"Love, Sexuality, and the Sacrament of Marriage\" by John Chryssavgis\n \n Thus Holy Tradition lives into our present age.

However, it would be a waste of your time to go about trying to stop someone from killing who has yet to kill or hasn't killed anyone for decades. I have no idea what should be done with random psychos, but again this is hardly relevant to homosexuality.\n \n I also don't think that the problem with Manson was that he \"sinned\". I don't think if he had worked on a Sunday or improperly bled an offering that people would be as worried about him as they are. I think it had more to do with the fact that he convinced his cult of followers to murder some random white rich people trying to frame black radicals in order to start what Manson felt was an inevitable \"race war\" where white people (led by Manson) would in the end again fully rule.\n \n \nWhy then is it wrong 'because someone dies'?

You were denying the influence of everyone; parents, society etc. Now you admit peers are influencing them? It must be a phase, if people feel same-sex orientation, and then move to heterosexuality.\n \n \"The peer group is an important phase in adolescent development. It is the peer group where the standard for what is normal or deviant begins, especially in terms of physical changes, body image, and behaviour. The adult intimate relationship starts to be experienced through heterosexual and homosexual friendship. In adolescent development the peer group becomes a secure atmosphere as the adolescent commences to separate him or herself from the family. It is in the peer group that the adolescent feels more comfortable expressing his or her feelings and exploring changes of common origin.\"\n http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1991/5/91.05.09.x.html#f\n \n That is still within the realm of what I discussed earlier. The youngster begin to experiment, some do so with homosexuality. Thus\n \"It is believed that all young people go through a phase of attraction to others of the same sex.\"\n http://www.acsta.ab.ca/resources/inclusive.htm (this site doesn't agree though on what makes one a homosexual).\n \n \"In their early teens, boys and girls tend to develop strong emotional attachments towards members of the same sex. For example, a shy introverted girl may be attracted to an aggressive extroverted girl. This homosexual phase (to be distinguished from homosexuality as a form of adult sexual behaviour) is soon followed by the heterosexual phase (between age 15-18).\"\n http://www.webhealthcentre.com/general/sm_adolos.asp\n \n \"Suffice to say that the phenomenon of homosexuality is complex and multi-faceted. It is concerned with the human ability to relate - a capacity shaped by psychological, sociological, biological, environmental and family influences. In fact, any human behaviour is going to be the result of the complex intermingling of genetics and environment. \"\n http://www.opendoors.com.au/AmIGay/AmIGay.htm\n \n That is, the person isn't 'born' gay. There's a whole range of reasons (one of which might be some influence in make-up; but it's not an essentialist argument that they're making).\n \n Further at the same site \"Too often intimacy is confused with sex - which is but a part of human relating. We live in a ?feel good? \n society where the message tends to be to go with one?s instincts rather than using caution and restraint. Old teachings and moral codes are often considered old fashioned or out-moded. This has left society in a valueless vacuum. \"\n \n That is, during the close-peer phase people start to experiment sexually with each other... this is what I stated earlier. Adolescents are still confused as they for their identity.\n \n They are encouraged to be gay...\n \"Some years ago a $50,000 national advertising campaign was launched by the AIDS Council and funded by the Federal Government. The ads appeared in the gay press and in teenage magazines ?Dolly? and ?Smash Hits?, targeting boys as young as 13. The aim, according to the President of the Australian Federation of AIDS Organizations, was to ?create fraternity among homosexual youths?. It targeted people around the age of puberty and adolescence, stating: ?They have such turbulent problems coming to terms with their sexuality.... We want them to know help is available? (AAP News report 15/4/93).\n http://www.opendoors.com.au/AmIGay/AmIGay.htm\n \n This campaign was clearly aimed at a very vulnerable group who could be at great risk entering a lifestyle fraught with risk-taking at a time when their cognitive and psychological development is still incomplete.\"\n \n \"Many adolescents encounter considerable difficulties in the process of identify formation. Martin [n11] describes the predicament: \"\n http://www.yapmn.com/articles/A.html\n \n \"Usually, the adolescent experiences homosexual feelings years before identifying himself as gay.\"\n http://mtsu32.mtsu.edu:11412/315/adoles/homosexuality.html\n \n When they are vulnerable, gay groups harvest them. Most professionals recognise homosexuality as a 'stage' or 'phase', you are not born that way, though you might have 'leanings'.\n \n \"Acquisition of a Homosexual Identity \n The various individual and environmental factors that contribute to a homosexual orientation are poorly understood. Endocrine, genetic, psychodynamic, and learning theories have been proposed, studied, and rebutted. [n9] More recently, attention has been focused on the process whereby the individual adopts and adapts to a homosexual identity.\"\n http://www.yapmn.com/articles/A.html\n \n They acquire gay identity.

A good reason, a compelling reason, a logical reason, an ethical reason, a reason based on anything but your particular sect's views, can you propose a one?\n\n \n Still subjectively put.

Most professionals recognise homosexuality as a 'stage' or 'phase', you are not born that way, though you might have 'leanings'.\n\n \n Homosexuality is not recognized as a stage itself. It is recognized that some gay people go through stages in coming to terms with their sexual identity, or in \"coming out\". Your own links show this. Homosexuals know they are different somehow from an early age.\n \n Here is something from one of your links...\n \n Sexual orientation is believed to be influenced by a variety of factors including genetics and hormones, as well as unknown environmental factors. Though the origins of sexual orientation are not completely understood, it is generally believed to be established during early childhood, usually before the age of five. (1) \n \n One of your pastor's links also states that some believe they are gay from an early age.\n \n No one is being \"harvested\". Youth are being given accurate information, without an anti-gay bias. The information is hardly being given by only \"gay groups\".",

   "\"In their early teens, boys and girls tend to develop strong emotional attachments towards members of the same sex. For example, a shy introverted girl may be attracted to an aggressive extroverted girl. This homosexual phase (to be distinguished from homosexuality as a form of adult sexual behaviour) is soon followed by the heterosexual phase (between age 15-18). During this phase, there is an attraction towards members of the opposite sex resulting in strong infatuations or deep passionate feelings. Romantic entanglements, eloping and suicide pacts are more common during this stage than any other. During this period, boys develop an interest in nude figures, pornography etc. to satisfy their erotic impulses. Girls, on the other hand, develop a thirst for passionate love stories, romantic movies etc.\"\n \n The so called \"homosexual phase\" is not sexual orientation. Clearly heterosexual orientation is being discussed in the second example.\n \n \n This is from the link to Bishop Fred Henry of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Bishop Henry is known here in Canada, as being opposed to gay rights. He caused quite a reaction when he suggested our former Primeminister was putting his salvation at risk, when former PM Chretien, supported legalizing same-sex marriage. Bishop Henry has never been anything close to a gay rights activist. Yet, even he recognizes that being gay is not a choice, and that sexual orientation is not a phase... \n \n \"3. Isn't homosexuality just an adolescent phase? \n \n It is believed that all young people go through a phase of attraction to others of the same sex. Although it is true that many older children and young teens prefer to be with peers of the same sex, this has more to do with socialization than sexual orientation. Some research suggests that sexual orientation is set before adolescence. Most teenagers are aware of their heterosexual or homosexual feelings, while others need extra time to resolve confusion regarding their sexual identity. Frequently, teenagers with a homosexual attraction will date members of the opposite sex in order to fit in or to test their feelings. They may pass as heterosexual until they feel safe to \"come out\" and develop relationships with people of the same sex. Many persons deny their same-sex attractions; others continue to seek self understanding; and some teenagers report with certainty that they have a homosexual orientation. When asked when they first became aware of their sexual orientation, homosexual persons usually say they \"always knew\". \n \n 4. How does a person know that he or she is homosexual? \n \n Understanding one's sexual orientation develops over a number of years, evolving from confusion to self-acceptance. Homosexual persons often recall feeling different from their peers during childhood, although that difference is not attributed to sexuality until years later. During puberty, identity confusion usually accompanies the onset of sexual attractions toward people of the same sex. The confusion is the result of dissonance between the person's inner feelings and the presentation of the world as heterosexual. Several years or more may elapse before he/she resolves confusion and adopts a homosexual identity. Additional time may be needed to integrate sexual feelings into a positive self identity. Acceptance is characterized by personal satisfaction, pride regarding one's sexual orientation, and energy to develop intimate relations. The process of identity acquisition is not a linear and orderly progression. It is a roller coaster struggle which hopefully results in positive self-acceptance. \n \n 5. Do adolescents choose to be homosexual? \n \n No. As was previously mentioned, sexual orientation results from a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Many theorists believe that sexual orientation is set by the time the child enters school. However, the individual may not become aware of their sexual feelings until they reach their teen years and experience puberty. Just as we can't choose the colour of our skin, we are also not able to choose our sexual orientation. What is a matter of choice is one's acceptance, self-esteem, and the way one lives out one's self-understanding.\"",

   "This doesn't do your argument well. You were denying the influence of everyone; parents, society etc. Now you admit peers are influencing them?\n\n \n Er, I don't know where you're getting this from. I said that sexuality is far too complex to come from any one source, parents, peers, genes, etc. Read the posts.\n \n \nThis campaign was clearly aimed at a very vulnerable group who could be at great risk entering a lifestyle fraught with risk-taking at a time when their cognitive and psychological development is still incomplete.\n\n \n How terrible, trying to keep young homosexual people from feeling that there might be any escape from their loneliness and isolation. How insidious, trying to get people to use prophylactics. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n If someone \"experiments\" with homosexuality and doesn't like it, an ad won't make them think they're homosexual. Teenagers aren't that confused.\n \n \nThey acquire gay identity.\n\n \n The same way that if I was interested in horseback riding, and when I was a teenager tried it and enjoyed it, so I did it often, I would eventually see myself as a horseback rider. Especially if everyone went around calling people \"horseback rider\" interchangably with \"stupid\". If I wasn't somehow gifted at or drawn to horseback riding in practice instead of just in theory, I would stop doing it, and that would not become my identity. \n \n Of course your gay identity is acquired. That does not mean there is not an innate component to homosexuality.\n \n \nThey are encouraged to look at traditional morals as bad.\n\n \n Well, that would be because anti-gay \"traditional morals\" are bad.\n \n \nIt is a good reason, religion. \n\n Fine then, I want to burn some babies for Baal. Religion's a good reason for sure.\n \n \nI like the little touch of 'snide' you've added by calling my faith a 'sect'. \n\n \n Nothing snide intended. A sect is just a religious denomination, or at least my dictionary agrees so. I am not a follower of a religious denomination, so I am not part of any sect.",

Those who go from straight to gay, did not have a solidly straight identity to begin with. \n\n what if the \"supposedly gay\" partner never acts on his homosexual feelings, but decides to supress them and maintain a faithful and commited heterosexual relationship. would he still be considered born gay?\n \n what about someone that had many homosexual experiences during his youth, then decided to settle down, change his life and maintain a monogamous heterosexual relationship for the rest of his life. would you consider him born gay?\n \n and what about someone that lived a heterosexual lifestyle, got married, raised a family, then somewhere is his late years decides he want to change, so he divorces his wife and hooks up with homosexual men for the rest of his life. would you consider him born gay?",

The protestant belief is that the bible is the determiner of doctrine and that man has merely recognize what is there. Jesus makes it clear that any sin is enough to deserve death. Paul, states that whoever has broken any of the law has broken the whole law (Romans). God has yet to punish for sin. He has provided consequences of sin. \n \n Example: The original sin in the garden of eden. Adam and Eve ate of the fruit of the tree of the nnowledge of good and evil. God banished them from the garden. Not to punish them, but rather to protect them. You may ask, how is this protection? The answer is in the bible. It says that God banished them so that they might not \"live forever in sin.\" Remember what else was in the garden? The tree of life. If they ate of that tree they would remain forever in sin. God wanted to give them life. God's punishments are for a reason and that reason is love. We may not always see it, but that is his essential nature.",

God's behaviour is logical not insane. Your metaphor of an abused child is not parallel as we cannot see what God sees. The child can see what the parent sees. More like a child that is told they cannot do something and the parent disciplines them. Discipline is sometimes necessary. God is merciful. He would have been completely just to destroy us at the beginning. Remember we are the ones that were not faithful. We betrayed not Him. he was merciful in that he withheld is wrath and took it out on His own Son. His own Son took it willingly.",

I haven't broken any Commandments being gay, nor do I take stock in laws written by ancient tribes who claim they spoke to God about it (c'mon, really) and I love my neighbor as myself which Jesus said was the highest of the Commandments.\n \n My only resource here is in the gospels (and no, I didn't write fabulous term papers nor was a member of the debate team in college) ....Jesus accepted Mary Magdalene, never once judged her \"behavior\" as an excuse to \"love\" her, and never once took liberty in calling her or ANYONE a sinner, but that that was God the Father's right only.\n \n Defining the sins of a sinner, regarding their behavior or not, is honoring your own judgment -- and --ahem -- I believe that breaks the First Commandment.\n\n \n Where, have I judged or condemned? Look at my previous posts. I have stated clearly what I believe the bible says about homosexuality as a behavior. Because I state a belief about the behavior is not an implication on the person. That is a straw man argument and falls on that basis alone. Not to mention I made it clear that God commands us to love all men. Period. Regardless of the behavior.\n \n Not to mention, Jesus did not say that loving my neigbor as myself was the highest commandment. The first one is \"love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your mind, with all your strength, and with all your soul.\" Only then does he say love your neighbor as yourself. Mind you he doesn't say love others as you want to be loved, but love others from the love of yourself. \n \n \n I do not define the sins. God does and they are clearly written in the bible. That does not make you evil. And from what I have read no one has stated anything to that effect. You have a simple disagreement. Unker has provided documentation and argumentation to support his position. You have attacked him as condoning persecution. This is argumentum ad hominem. It is also a logical fallacy.\n \n Your arguments fall apart on three things. 1) Straw man fallacy, 2) incorrect quoting and equivocating fallacy, 3) argumentum ad hominem.\n \n If you disagree with him that being homosexual is a choice then provide evidence and argumentation (with logic and not fallacy) to the contrary. But, do not attack him because of it. \n \n You have now resorted to attacking me when all I have done is point out the error in your logic. You can FEEL attacked all you want, but your feelings don't have to drive your actions. You are (presumably) a rational thinking being with a capability to objectively look at the argument and not personalize.\n \n It really is prejudice to presume that because someone disagrees with your opinion that they are just condoning persecution. If he said, \"for this reason we should force gay people to believe\" or something similar then he would be condoning. \n \n No one has forced you to believe in any God, no one has said that you must believe this that or the other thing. He is providing an opinion (as am I) and backing it up. THAT IS THE POINT OF A DEBATE FORUM. Get over it.",

   "Happiness is relative. \n There are unhappy homosexuals as well as unhappy heterosexuals.

But it is a debate forum. Note the top of your screen where it says \"debate search by\". Debate is where you offer an opinion. You provide documentation to back up your opinion, even if it the opinion of one who is considered an authority. You and I are not authorities so we refer to authorities. Psychologists, doctors, political leaders, text books, studies, web sites, news articles etc. We then use our ability to reason so that we may provide an analysis of all this information. We use logic to back it up. To base your opinions on personal experieince is fine, but it is possible (as you are not perfect) that your analysis of your personal experieince is flawed. \n \n Logic is good if your assumptions are good. If you have bad assumptions you can still be very logical and come to the wrong conclusion. Often there are disagreements on the assumptions and debates form over those. Religion is a good example. Most debate concerning this is over the base assumptions. See the thread entitled \"Who Is Jesus\" in the religion thread. There are over five hundred posts on this one sub thread. It is the largest in this forum. It is a big subject. It is about base assumptions.\n \n Your ideas and opinions are welcome, as are everyones.

You state that you are gay. Okay. That is between you and God. I will not pass judgement. But, I may have an opinion about certain behavior associated with the gay life style. That does not mean I judge you it simply means that I have an understanding from certain base assumptions. You have not asked those assumptions nor have I offered them at this point on this argument. You may or may not like what they are. That is irrelvant. The question is can I back it up?\n \n Does that help?",

Why single out gays? \n 3)Homosexuality cannot even be defined by behavior - gays generally do not choose to be gay. Why would anyone choose to be gay?

Interestingly, convicted murderers and embezzlers are not denied the right to marriage - neither are adulterers...Being in jail does not limit anyone from consitutional rights...\n 5)It is not illegal to be gay. \n 6)I think it is reprehensible if a person squanders his/her youth on frivolous relationships. Why? There are actual consequences with a human cost. How this is somehow ok and being gay is not makes no sense to me...Heteros and gays are both capable of loving relationships and hurtful ones. Being gay isn't selfish behavior. Manipulating relationships is. I think doing so is reprehensible, gay or straight...\n \n Question:\n Why is it when those who are so condemning of homosexuality often focus on sexual behavior? Sodomy doesn't define homsexuality. Being gay is not about sex as being hetero also is not. I think there might some underlying problems with those who focus the argument on sex. Its not about plumbing. \n \n \n -Mike C.\n =======================\n \nYour argument doesn't make sense to me. If homosexuality is akin to lying, cheating, violence, etc., wouldn't that imply it is appropriate to deny homosexuals rights just as society denies rights to slanderers, embezzlers, murderers, etc.? E.g., society fines the latter or puts them in jail. If indeed homosexuality is akin to other criminal behavior, aren't you the one being selective about \"which fallen traits of man\" you are tolerating? Furthermore, your premise is wrong--some selfish behavior deserves punishment while some does not. You use wrong reasoning from a false premise to arrive at a false conclusion.\n \n A distinction should be made between reprehensible (deserving of punishment) behaviors and bad behaviors. For instance, if a man wants to squander his youth in mistress chasing, that is bad, but it should not be considered reprehensible. Indeed, as a result of bad males behaving thus, their likely bad future wives get less than they otherwise would, the goodness of which exceeds the badness of whatever increases in mistresses the bad males might get as a result of their excessively trying to get them.\n",

But I wish I had the strength to embrace everyone. \n \n Obviously, I also have differing opinions on the dynamics of homosexualtiy (like the ongoing debat over behavior/orientation and the like which I am sure will keep circling here and I know some of my fellow believers may not like that fact that I think God can bless gay marriages despite the fact that it is not according God's ideal plan). But my bottom line is this...Why should I judge here? \n \n I will end my portion of this thread here. The arguments here are going in circles and I don't see it closing anytimes soon. I did post on a newer one, though.\n \n Peace.\n MC\n\n \n \n \n Your right, this is going is circles.\n \n \n But I would like to clarify my last point: We cannot tell them it's not a sin if it isn't. And to marry to people of the same sex would to actively take part in and encourage their sin.",

   "Point taken unk. I appologize. As far as \"sin\" I guess I kinda drew an inference, and I was wrong. But I do not buy the argument of homosexuality being a behavioral pattern. By your logic is heterosexuality a behavior pattern also?\n\n \n If you define one as a behavior pattern then you would necessarily define the other as a behavior pattern. One could not say that I am born heterosexual. I have chosen heterosexuality. Homosexuality really is not my problem. I have others. Each one has their own issues. We get into trouble when we start saying that we cannot choose which we do. \n \n The desire for someone of the same sex, is likely not a chosen behavior. It may be a learned response, it may be genetically inherent. I don't think a person can directly control their feelings. We do not have direct access. We cannot turn them on and off without changing other things. Our feelings are necessarily tied to our thoughts. How we think will determine how we feel. Feelings may effect our thinking, but ultimately our thinking is what we have direct access too. By changing the way we think, we can thereby change our feelings.",

Anyway, that is basically what I was driving at. It seems that many people on here are making the inference that homosexuality is a choice, and heterosexuality is inborn. I would rather think that humans are born in more of an asexual state, and through our experiences we develop into sexual beings. I also think it is certainly possible to have a genetic component to sexual identity, which is expressed as we mature. It is the old nature vs. nurture argument. I think it is probably a little of both...but I cannot prove that. I completely agree that sexual identity cannot be switched on and off like a light, it is deeply woven into our minds. I believe that it is possible for someone to go from homosexual to heterosexual, or vice versa, but it must be from changing their own mind. I find it a little naive for some of the people on this board to think that they can go about preaching that homosexuality is a sin, and that you can leave it all behind in the blink of an eye. IMHO, This kind of behavior pushes people further away...after all, nobody likes to be told what they should believe or how they should live their lives. It's one thing to make the information available for those who want to see it, it is completely different to hit someone over the head with it until the read it out of fear or frustration.",

Sinful behavior is really placing anything else in the place of God. Humans have a sin nature (or so says christian doctrine, and my personal belief). It is because of this nature that we do sinful acts. We are not sinful because we sin. Rather we sin because we are sinful. It is why God is so important IMHO. God is the only one with the resources to deal with Sin. As a christian, I prefer to point out to people God. I let God deal with anything sinful, both in me and others. I am not perfect (or even really very good) at this. But it is a foundational belief of mine. The old saying of hate the sin and love the sinner is only partly accurate. \n \n I believe homosexual behavior is ultimately harmful to people. I also believe sex outside of marriage whether homosexual or not is ultimately harmful to people. I also believe that lying to someone is ultimately harmful to me. and so on.",
