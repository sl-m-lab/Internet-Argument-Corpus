   "Existing-home sales plunge to a two-year low\n \n WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - July was dry for the U.S. real estate market, as sales of existing homes plunged 4.1% to a two-year low, prices stagnated and the number of homes on the market soared to a 13-year high, according to a report from the National Association of Realtors released Wednesday.\n The report shows a continued implosion in the housing market, with inventories up sharply while prices are softening. Sales are down 11.4% in the past year to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.33 million compared with 6.60 million in June. \n \n \"The end of the housing boom has come quickly and taken many homeowners who had anticipated an easy sale by surprise,\" said Roger Kubarych, an economist for HVB Group. \n \n The market hasn't hit bottom yet, said Phillip Neuhart, an analyst for Wachovia, who said the sales rate would continue to decline through 2007. \n The \"boom markets are cooling significantly,\" said David Lereah, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. Sales fell in all four regions, led by a 6.4% drop in the West. \n \n Economists were expecting a 0.9% decline in sales to 6.56 million, according to a survey conducted by MarketWatch. The 4.1% drop was larger than any of the 39 economists predicted. See Economic Calendar. \n Sales of condos rebounded 2.8% in July to 818,000. Sales of single-family homes fell 5% to 5.51 million, the lowest since January 2004. The 5% monthly drop has been exceeded just once in the past 10 years. \n Sluggish economy\n \n Lereah said half of the nation's housing markets had been growing and half shrinking. But now only a third are growing. Some markets that never boomed are now weakening because of sluggish local economies, he said, pointing to Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and parts of the Northeast. \n \n \"It's important for the [Federal Reserve] to understand how fragile the housing market is, and how fragile the economy is,\" Lereah said. \"The economy impacts housing, and housing impacts the economy.\" \n What impact the housing meltdown will have on the economy is the major policy question facing the Fed. While policymakers have said they don't believe consumer spending will decline, some independent economists worry that the ripple effect will be large. \n \n \n\n \n http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/story.aspx?guid=%7BDB73D707-FE88-4257-849E-79F720503BDC%7D\n \n It is important to note a couple of things. First, the increasesin prices in the south are the result of hurricane related sales. Followin the hurricane, average home prices fell becuase there were a LOT of damaged homes selling cheaply. Now what is being sold is new ore repaired homes, so obviously the price is going to increase. looking at figures, it appears that this has had a major enough impact to account for either all or nearly all of the increase int he south.\n \n I think that we can kiss the \"soft landing\" scenario goodbye. That scenario essentially depended on homebuyers recognizing that the market was overvalued, but purchasing new homes anyway. Apparently while the american people are indeed a bunch of XXXXXX, they are not quite that stupid. \n \n Lereah does not seem to grasp the fact that the feds job is to help regulate the value of the dollar. It is not to prop up real estate values. This does lead to some interesting questions about how the fed will deal with the RE bust. Obviously the decline of housing will have an inflationary effect on the economy. We have pumped like 3 trillion in equity into the economy due to the housing boom, and as the underlying assets devalue, the dollar is destined to fall. No question. \n \n The problme in this case is that if we use the typical reaction to inflation, which is to increase interet rates, it will drive housing further under, resulting in an increased inflationary effect. On the other had, the decreases in home sales and prices has been far above what can simply be expalined away due to interest rate increases. The public has figured out that this is another dot com waiting to happen, and they are not willing to buy no name tech stock at the top of the bubble this time around. So, even if interest rates do not continue to rise, or even if they are reduced slightly, it seems like the housing bubble will continue to deflate or pop.\n \n The REALLY funny thing about this particular article is their use of David Lereah as an expert source. For those not familiar, he is with the National Association of Realtors. He is their senior economist and mouthpiece. He worte a book that was published last year\n \n http://www.randomhouse.com/doubleday/currency/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780385514347\n \n \nAre You Missing the Real Estate Boom?\n The Boom Will Not Bust and Why Property Values Will Continue to Climb Through the End of the Decade - And How to Profit From Them\n Written by David Lereah\n \n Are you missing the real estate boom? Can you increase your wealth from it? For most people-including current homeowners-the answer is a resounding yes.\n \n But it's not too late to increase your stake in the greatest real estate boom of our generation. Whether you are a first-time buyer or already own your home, Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom? will show you how you can dramatically increase your overall wealth. Author David Lereah, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, shows why the real estate market is poised to climb higher over the next decade-and explains what you can do to profit from it.\n\n \n As recently as June he was shouting abotu how Real Estate is still the worlds best investment and about how we were \"at the absolute bottom of a slight correction\".\n \n What a freaking idiot.\n \n Any thoughts on where this will all go? Even jsut nasty comments about Lereah are welcome, since that lying scumbag has been my nemisis for a long time now.",

IF a drop like that occurs, I have little to no confidence that it will halt at 50% of gains over the last 5 years. You are looking at 1.5 trillion dollars there (3 trillion in total gains over the last 5 years). The dot com bubble was $1 trillion. The problem is that with the dot com bubble, the fed dropped interest rates to emergency levels, creating liquity in an attempt to drive expansion and investment, essentially trying to sop up the money created in the dot com bubble. The other problem is that in the dot com bubble, only about 60% of that trillion dollars was actually moneterized. The rest was hypothetical paper money. In the housing bubble, over 90% of that 3 trillion is moneterized. That money was actually printed and spent.\n \n So, lets be generous and say a 50% reduction equals only $1 trillion in real money that was backed by real equity which is suddenly gone. Monetary inflation is a foregone conclusion, especially when you figure that foreign banks and governments have already been caught in the last year dumping dollars and dollar assets (our debt). \n \n Consumer level inflationin such a scenario seems inevitable. So, you have consumer level inflation, increasing consumer prices across the board.\n \n I guess what I am having trouble with is in buying that there will only be a 50% correction given the external influences. With our massive debt load, crippled industrial base, consumer spendign driven consumer economy, and a massive real estate bubble it is the perfect economic storm. \n \n I also don't think that the fed is going to be able to do anything at all about the housing bubble. There are 2 reasons for this, one historic and one logic based. When the japanese real estate market started to tank, fairly on in the process, the japanese crashed interest rates to .5% on the theory that people would start buying real estate again if it was cheap enough to finance. It didn't work. Then they briefly shot interest rates through the roof, thinking that they would strangle inflation. That didn't work either.\n \n I guess that my problem with the concept of the fed cushioning the housign market is that it relies on people being a lot dumber than I think that people generally are. Now that the market has turned, and is started back down, and that decline is accelerating, I don't think there is any hope of saving the market form the correction, and it is going to correct until something happens to make it stop. The classic problem with deflation is that consumers stop buying. Why buy today when you can buy cheaper tomorrow? Home buyers are not going to continue to purchase houses that are generally agreed to be overpriced regardless of where the fed puts interest rates. People are not going to pay tens of thousands of extra dollars for a house simply becuase they can get the mortgage for a point lower. Its simply not going to happen. \n \n Teh one thing that appears to be constant in all equity bubbles throughout history is that no external influence can stop them once they start to go. There have been several bubbles where people have observed the decline and recognized it for what it was, but nobosy has ever managed to stop one, or even control one. They run their course and then you pick up what you can of the pieces. \n \n I am firmly convinced that greenspans attempt to mitigate the effects of the dot com crash led to the housing bubble. The problem is that there seems to be an idea that we can simply do the same with the housing bubble. If it gets too bad, we can crash interest rates and \"fix\" it. Teh problem wiht this line of reasoning is that when greenspan did his thing with the dot com bubble, the housing market sucked up all that free cash. Now, if the housing bubble burst, what US market can actually soak up a tirllion dollars in cash?",

Few are aware of what a net present value calculation with even a modest discount factor consisting of monetary devaluation and real inflation do to those 'investments'. \n \n Combine that asset erosion with the housing bubble loss of equity (I hope 50% is the bottom but seriously doubt it for tract crackerbox working class level once adjustable mortgage defaults begin), wage stagnation, real inflation and the Fed will have its hands full. With current US deficit policy of letting the printing presses run wide open in a payment imbalance circumstance, allowing inflation to run its course is about all they can do. \n \n I do both first trust deed and construction loans on an individual and pool investment basis. I'm out of the residential side with a few bruises, but here's what's happening on that residential side:\n \n 1. Spec (new) houses have been going into default, unsold, for the past three months. In most cases this is private money and not reflected in real estate association statistics or government reports compiled of federally insured mortgages. No public alarm sounded.\n 2. A $500k spec house has 20% developer margin in the selling price. Upon default investors reprice the house for $400k in an attempt to recoup their investments. That starts a chain reaction, meaning resales in that price range must drop to $400k to remain competitive in an already declining market. \n 3. In a worst case scenario, most investors feel 50% salvage of a defaulted investment as desirable, so the $500k spec house will eventually be dropped to $250k or less in an effort to salvage capital. The resale market has no choice but to follow that price line. \n \n There's a 50% drop in whole equity, not gained, of new and existing homes just from financing dynamics, with no increased interest rate impact. More important, a substantial amount of private investment capital has vaporized, unavailable for contribution to future growth of any industry.",

Central banks have signaled lately (in many cases by actually DOING it) that they have no reservations about downscaling or even eliminating dollar holdings and dollar denominated assets (Treasury issues).

Either the fed will let the dollar go, both at the consumer level (CPI) and on the international scene, in which case already cash strapped american consumers will have a hell of a time purchasing anything but the bare necessities, resulting in a virtual meltdown of housing and luxury goods markets, OR, the fed will fight inflation, in which case the housing market implodes, interest rates are driven absolutly through the roof, and your average american goes bankrupt due to their credit debt, BUT they survive as consumers because the value of the dollar is at least somewhat preserved.\n \n I know I am goign to take some heat for saying this, but I think that if there is a bit of common sense in the world, our upcoming economic problems which are all but unavoidable at this point shoudl be the last nail in the coffin of the fiat money system. The fiat money system has simply proven too succeptible to internal equity bubbles and what amount to accounting scams to be acceptable. With no metal backing, your fiat money is essentially backed by the strength of your economy. It is simply too easy to go heavy on internal, service transaction in a consumer economy and project the image of economic strength, allowing you to print excess money inflation free while your actual economic fundamentals go to pot. We saw this in russia, argentenia, and now the US (those are the best known examples...there are plenty more examples of currency failures based on poor economic fundamentals being hidden by apparently positive numbers). \n \n I am goign to go further out on a limb and suggest that the idea that deflation is always a negative is a scam perpetrated by the wealthy. First, the concept that deflation is always negative is contrary to the very core capitalist theory. According to cpaitalist theory, companies are supposed to be working hard to figure out how to provide us consumer goods at the lowest possible price. Companies that are sucessful at this are rewarded with out dollars, companies that are not go out of business. One of the base tenants of capitalism is that if comapny A makes a widget for $4, company B figures out how to make it for $2, and company A is rewarded for their enginuity while company B either goes out of business, or figures out how to make that widget for $1.50. \n \n This being the case, deflation should be a natural part of the capitalist system. I am not sure how they managed to convince people that innovation resulting in lower consumer prices is a BAD thing. Another cornerstone of capitalist theory is the law of supply and demand. It was a cool trick indeed to convince people that the laws of supply and demand are only good when they lead to an INCREASE in prices, but that they are TERRIBLY destructive when they lead to price DECREASES. ########. Periodic deflation should be as natural a part of the economic cycle as periodic inflation. The inflationary side of the cycle essentially benifits producers and investors, while the deflationary side benifits consumers. How in the world did they manage to convince people that the side that benifits the consumers is the bad one??? \n \n In our case (US), underlying fundamentals favor price deflation. Currently, the average markup on consumer goods, excluding transportation (vehicles) is 52%. That is absolutly insane. While investors certainly deserve some premium for taking their risk, and producers certainly deserve a profit margin, 52% is just so far out there as to be ludicrous. That is just raping the consumer no matter how you cut it.",

A fiat currency encourages it far to much, and a corrupt government only promotes it. \n \n\n I know I am goign to take some heat for saying this, but I think that if there is a bit of common sense in the world, our upcoming economic problems which are all but unavoidable at this point shoudl be the last nail in the coffin of the fiat money system. The fiat money system has simply proven too succeptible to internal equity bubbles and what amount to accounting scams to be acceptable. With no metal backing, your fiat money is essentially backed by the strength of your economy. It is simply too easy to go heavy on internal, service transaction in a consumer economy and project the image of economic strength, allowing you to print excess money inflation free while your actual economic fundamentals go to pot. We saw this in russia, argentenia, and now the US (those are the best known examples...there are plenty more examples of currency failures based on poor economic fundamentals being hidden by apparently positive numbers). \n \n I am goign to go further out on a limb and suggest that the idea that deflation is always a negative is a scam perpetrated by the wealthy. First, the concept that deflation is always negative is contrary to the very core capitalist theory. According to cpaitalist theory, companies are supposed to be working hard to figure out how to provide us consumer goods at the lowest possible price. Companies that are sucessful at this are rewarded with out dollars, companies that are not go out of business. One of the base tenants of capitalism is that if comapny A makes a widget for $4, company B figures out how to make it for $2, and company A is rewarded for their enginuity while company B either goes out of business, or figures out how to make that widget for $1.50. \n \n This being the case, deflation should be a natural part of the capitalist system. I am not sure how they managed to convince people that innovation resulting in lower consumer prices is a BAD thing. Another cornerstone of capitalist theory is the law of supply and demand. It was a cool trick indeed to convince people that the laws of supply and demand are only good when they lead to an INCREASE in prices, but that they are TERRIBLY destructive when they lead to price DECREASES. ########. Periodic deflation should be as natural a part of the economic cycle as periodic inflation. The inflationary side of the cycle essentially benifits producers and investors, while the deflationary side benifits consumers. How in the world did they manage to convince people that the side that benifits the consumers is the bad one??? \n \n In our case (US), underlying fundamentals favor price deflation. Currently, the average markup on consumer goods, excluding transportation (vehicles) is 52%. That is absolutly insane. While investors certainly deserve some premium for taking their risk, and producers certainly deserve a profit margin, 52% is just so far out there as to be ludicrous. That is just raping the consumer no matter how you cut it.\n",

And now the question is, How do we deal with the current situation?\" Hubbard told Reuters on the sidelines of the Kansas City Fed's annual Jackson Hole retreat.\n\n \n I actually agree with Hubabrd here. I think we needed to start really hititng interest rates harder over a year ago. IMO Greenspan simply did not want the recession to be credited to him. While I think that the housing bubble popping was inevitable regardless of interest rates, increased rates did, IMO, help speed it along.\n \n I am still having trouble envisioning a scenario where this does not ultimatly end in a severe economic depression. \n \n I really do feel sorry for all those poor folks who have been suckered into 401ks for their retirement fund, as well as those who have counted on their home as a vessel for the majority of their wealth.",

   "The natural consequence of historical inflation is the collapse of bubbles and the liquidation of malinvestment - in this case primarily loss of dollar value of housing, bankruptcy of a good portion of the construction industry, and the effects of these spreading out, to a lesser extent, through other sections of the economy - an overall decline most pronounced in those sectors most closely associated with the inflationary boom.\n \n But the monetary environment is of course, not natural. It is largely controlled by the federal reserves policy, and their response to any deflationary collapse of this kind will of course be to open the floodgates of monetary inflation once more - because inflation is the tool with which governments, banks and major corporations steal from the wallets and pay packets of those who create things with actual value.\n \n The best case scenario in the short run is that through pumping out more fiat currency, another inflationary boom will be triggered. Of course, this in no way solves the problem, only postpones it, since at this point each inflationary boom is shorter lived and requires more inflation to sustain it. It is the equivalent of a heroin addict solving the problem of his withdrawals by taking ever larger doses of heroin.\n \n So should such a solution be acceptable to us? Only if you believe, as Keynes did, that in the long run we will all be dead (and screw our children), and that the \"long run\" is still 60 years, and not 3 or 5.\n \n The only real solution is to accept the deflationary collapse, abandon inflation, allow the economy to recover and grow in a real as opposed to artificial, inflationary environment, and hope that global gains in the productivity of labour stemming from the freeing of markets in asia result in a relatively brief period of suffering and a bright future.\n \n But of course, solutions aren't what the fed or the government are interested in, they want control, of your money, but most of all, of you.",
