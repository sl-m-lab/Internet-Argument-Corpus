You are fooling yourself if you think you can get an Orthodox Jew, an Hasidic Jew, a Reform Jew in the same room with a Catholic, a Baptist, a Unitarian, an Evangelical Christian and have a unanimous agreement on what the \"Judeo-Christian tradition\" is. So, if my answer is not sufficient, I will just move to another post. My post still stands on this thread if you care to participate: \n \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.(The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America in Congress July 4, 1776)\n \n If that is the basis of our rights, then we don't we need to acknowledge that this same Creator endowed the province of carrying of the fertilized ovum to the female of our species? Don't we need to trust that decision? Doesn't taking the position that a government can take that divine endowment of the Creator away from the female of our species is to undermine the very source of our rights.\n\n You make a huge, and so far quite unfounded, assumption that because a woman carries a child, that the Creator endowed them with the right to kill that child should they so choose. The existence of this right is clearly not self-evident, for it was permissable to proscribe abortion until 1973. Tell me, what Creator endows one person with the right to kill another person?",

   "A consistant pro-choice view is that a woman would be justified in killing a newborn baby, or \"allowing it to starve\" (to be politically incorrect) if she did not want to offer her bodily resources as nutrition and if there were no other options. \n \n \n \n The question is whether we have become so arrogant that we think we know better than the Creator and the natural process put into place by that Creator.\n\n The creator as defined in the Torah never gave women the authority to kill their young. In fact, this creator laid down laws and precepts which restricted them from doing certain things with their own body. Furthermore, to reason that this (abortion) was permitted as an innate quality of \"responsibility\" created within human beings is to assume that the murder of human beings would have been permitted before the fall of man. I see no evidence of this in the Torah. \n \n \nI believe that the Creator gave the responsibility to Eve. Who do you think he gave the responsibility for the ovum, embryo, and fetus? There was no government then.\n\n The responsibility for what? The \"responsibility\" to be able to kill her child? Your case is very weak. If by responsibility you mean nurturing and raising a child, ok I see evidence of that. If by responsibility you mean killing a child, where is it given? All I see said is \"be fruitful and multiply.\"\n Regarding government, I think it is evident that in the Torah, government existed at this time, but this is beside the point and irrelevant to the issue of abortion.\n \n \nI don' think He said to Adam and Eve, \"Be fruitful and multiply and if you don't do it right, I give the government the authority to make sure you do.\" My translation of the Torah does not say that. Does yours?\n\n No, it says be fruitful and multiply. Now, how does killing fit into this?\n \n \nShow me where God granted the specific permission to any government to wrest the responsibility from the creation he designated as the responsible party and claim it for itself. By creating a natural procreation system that places the ovum inside Eve, he gave her autonomy and responsibility over everything regarding that ovum (fertilized or not) until the birth of a child.\n \n\n Would you show me where God gave Eve specific permission to kill the human being growing inside of her. There is a distinction between an ovum and an embryo. Women do not \"own\" the child in their womb. \n \n \nWill we turn our back on the Creator's determination that entrusts the responsibility for carrying the fetus to the female, with all the rights, privileges and accountabilities which come with that? \n\n If we are talking about the Torah, you must prove that god gave women the freedom to kill their young who are not part of their bodies. You have not.\n \n \nWill we wrest that divine endowment from the female and hand over the responsibility to a government?\n\n That divine endowment? Within the framework of the Torah, it does not exist. Men and women do not have a \"divine endowment\" to kill their young. \n \n Here is something to think about Howard. \n Suppose that after Eve gave birth to Abel she decided that she did not like him. Now imagine that Adam decides to go on a long trip across the fertile crescent. According to your wrong assumptions, Eve who has total responsibility over Abel. She can do what she wants with him. She can kill him, she can mutilate him - whatever she wants. She can kill Abel, something that god punished Cain for because it was wrong. These are the conclusions to your assumption.\n \n You have added to the Torah an assumption that is not there and have created a creator in your own image.",

My point is the location of the baby is the damning difference between the two babies. It is the same difference between 2 identical twins in the short time when one has been born and one has not yet been born.\n\n \n Chloe, you are absolutely correct. Location is the only matter that differs - for the fetus/baby.\n \n However you are completely ignoring the perspective of the other individual involved - the mother. The difference between pregnancy and holding a child in one's arms is TREMENDOUS. You can't even begin to compare the two. \n \n A child outside the womb can be given to another care- taker and does not have to impact the health, life-style, livlihood, etc. of the mother. That is not the case with a pregnancy. \n \n I am fine with your pro-life stance - however for you to not recognize that pregnancy impacts women vastly differently than the care for an already born child is one the worst examples of the trivialization of women I have ever seen in my life.",

   "Chloe:\n \n I assume the post below is the post you are talking about. Well, nothing on this post addresses my problem with your position. I think your statements are frivolous, but I will, out of courtesy, address what you think are \"issues\" since you are using it as a rationale not to answer my questions.\n \n \nA consistant pro-choice view is that a woman would be justified in killing a newborn baby, or \"allowing it to starve\" (to be politically incorrect) if she did not want to offer her bodily resources as nutrition and if there were no other options.\nThis is not my view, so why do you demand that I respond to something that is not my position?\n \n \nThe creator as defined in the Torah never gave women the authority to kill their young. In fact, this creator laid down laws and precepts which restricted them from doing certain things with their own body. Furthermore, to reason that this (abortion) was permitted as an innate quality of \"responsibility\" created within human beings is to assume that the murder of human beings would have been permitted before the fall of man. I see no evidence of this in the Torah.\nNo matter how you twist it (and some of your verbal and logical gymnastics are fun to watch) my position is that the Creator gave woman not government the responsibility for the ovum (fertilized or not). I am not arguing for or against abortion, I am simply saying that the Creator endowed the female and not a government with the responsibility and if she errs she is answerable for her sins just like anyone else. Your position is to take the responsibility away from the woman and give it to the government. My position is that the Creator gave that responsibility to the woman and it is the height of arrogance to think that you or any human being knows better.\n \nThe responsibility for what? The \"responsibility\" to be able to kill her child? Your case is very weak. If by responsibility you mean nurturing and raising a child, ok I see evidence of that. If by responsibility you mean killing a child, where is it given? All I see said is \"be fruitful and multiply.\" \n And that is all the Creator said. He put the responsibility on the female.\n \n \nRegarding government, I think it is evident that in the Torah, government existed at this time, but this is beside the point and irrelevant to the issue of abortion.\nWonderful slight of hand: a government existed at the time of creation! I didn't know that. Whose administration was it? Nebuchadnezzar Bush?\n \n \nWould you show me where God gave Eve specific permission to kill the human being growing inside of her. There is a distinction between an ovum and an embryo. Women do not \"own\" the child in their womb\nWould you show me where God gave government the specific permission to determine the God's will with regard to the procreation of the human race or fetus in a woman's womb? Neither you or any government \"own\" the fetus in a woman's womb.\n \n \nIf we are talking about the Torah, you must prove that god gave women the freedom to kill their young who are not part of their bodies. You have not.\nIf you are talking about handing over to government the freedom or right to determine what is right for a fetus growing in a woman's womb, you must prove that God gave the government that freedom or right. You have not.\n \n \nThat divine endowment? Within the framework of the Torah, it does not exist. Men and women do not have a \"divine endowment\" to kill their young.\nSo your position isthat the responsibility for the ovum (fertilized or not) is NOT the God given province of the woman, but the God given province of the government. Why then does God have the fetus held within a woman for 9 month instead of just having her sit on an egg like a chicken? Is God that stupid that he put the fetus in a woman but did not trust the judgment of the female? If he didn't trust the judgment of the female we would be hatched not birthed.\n \n \nHere is something to think about Howard. \n Suppose that after Eve gave birth to Abel she decided that she did not like him. Now imagine that Adam decides to go on a long trip across the fertile crescent. According to your wrong assumptions, Eve who has total responsibility over Abel. She can do what she wants with him. She can kill him, she can mutilate him - whatever she wants. She can kill Abel, something that god punished Cain for because it was wrong. These are the conclusions to your assumption.\nHere is something to think about Chloe.\n \n Imagine that you do not know God's will and you are interfering with his divine plan by wresting the responsibility for the ovum from the female of the species in whose body he placed it.\n \n \nYou have added to the Torah an assumption that is not there and have created a creator in your own image.\nNo, you have taken the position that you know better than God.\n \n Have I addressed what you needed addressed so that you may now answer the questions I put to you?",

From this, you have determined that it is solely her responsibility, and consequently, it is soley her decision whether she should carry the child to term, or terminate its life. I must commend you. You have chosen your words very carefully, but no matter what words you choose to use, your position still holds that no one has the right to restrict one person, the woman, from killing another person, the child, that is living and growing within her.\n \n \nI applaud your misrepresentative flight on the trapeze. Your statement has nothing to do with my thought. Read it again. God gave a responsibility to the female that you think you have the right to assign elsewhere. I assume God knew what he was doing.

You, on the other hand, have assumed that the Creator has endowed one person, the woman, with the right to kill another person, the child.\n \n You are basing your assumption on your own philosophical reflection, not in the words of the Torah. As we have clearly seen throughout this thread, you have failed to reveal where the divine fundamental endowment you assert is to be found. Some text from the Torah backing up your assumption would be enough, yet you have not presented any text. You have merely presented a philosophical reflection upon an observation you could have made even if the Torah didn't exist. So, why try to invoke the Torah as your authority?\n \n \nFor my personal edification, please show me your source for the premise that \"God entrusts the strong with the responsibility to rule the weak.\"\n\n It is based upon the same rationale that you have asserted in this thread. You have made your observations from a state of nature. Just to be clear, what I mean by this is what rights, responsibilities, etc. exist outside the realm of any government or community. You have looked at the account of Creation, and have reasoned from an observation that because a woman is given the responsibility of child rearing, that she has therefore been entrusted by the Creator to choose how to carry out that responsibility.\n \n Using the same method, I have observed that the state of nature created by the Creator designated the responsibility of ownership to the strongest people. It is quite clear, for why else would the Creater have endowed some men/women with strength, and other men/women with weakness. Shouldn't we trust the Creator with this decision? \n \n \nReally? It is not the natural state that the woman carries the ovum (fertilized or not)? I think we all would appreciate a lesson in \"Coneian\" biology. It would prove fascinating.\n\n I think you misunderstood what I meant by state of nature. If the definition I gave above does not clarify it, I shall try to do better.\n \n \nNo, you have \"fancied\" things I did not say.\n\n Words, arguments, and belief systems all have consequences. For example, you simply ignored my argument at the beginning of this post because you didn't say the word \"kill!\" But, the consequence of your position as posted in this thread clearly shows your belief that the woman, and only the woman, should decide how to exert that responsibility. But, this position has an underlying assumption: that there is a legitimate choice. By assuming a legitimate choice, you assume that the there are at least two options. The two options are clearly whether to bring the child to term, or end the pregnancy. That is, whether to let the child live, or to ensure that it does not.\n \n This brings up an interesting point. If the Creator intended that the woman should be able to choose between letting the child live, or ensuring that it does not, then why did it take so long for him to bring about the means necessary to safely execute that choice. Thus it is clear to see that even the state of nature you are reasoning from would not allow a woman to teminate her pregnancy, it would only allow her to kill the child after its birth.",

   "Dearest Chloe:\n \n It seems that your self-righteousness has increased your need to put words in my mouth, and decreased your ability to read. I find it not only counterproductive, but insulting that you misrepresent what I am saying. \n \n I have already addressed every question in this last post of yours. I will simply, out of courtesy, rephrase my responses in hopes that you will remove the dogma from your eyes and read them.\n \n \nAgain, would you show me where God gave Eve specific permission to kill the human being growing inside of her? Where, Howard? If we are talking about the Torah, you must prove that god gave women the freedom to kill their young who are not part of their bodies. You have not. You have assumed that a divine endowment to kill children was given by the creator found in the Torah. Yet, you cannot back up your assumption. This is because within the framework of the Torah, it does not exist. Men and women do not have a \"divine endowment\" to kill their young. You may have to find some other basis (surely you must have another) to back up your biased dogma.\nThis is what I said:\n \n Will we turn our back on the Creator's determination that entrusts the responsibility for carrying the fetus to the female, with all the rights, privileges and accountabilities which come with that? Will we wrest that divine endowment from the female and hand over the responsibility to a government?\n \n Nowhere in those questions are the words \"permission to kill a human being\", \"freedom to kill their young\", \"divine endowment to kill children\". If you are so blinded that you cannot see that the female human has been given the responsibility for the ovum within her, and neither you nor I know why God gave that responsibility to her, there is no sense continuing a dialogue with you. You need to show where God gave you the specific right or responsibility to assign the control of the ovum to a government.\n \n \nTo reason that this (abortion) was permitted as an innate quality of \"responsibility\" created within human beings is to assume that the murder of human beings would have been permitted before the fall of man. There is no evidence of this in the Torah.\n \n What do you think about this? This is a major flaw in your assumption. How do you see that an innate license to kill is included in an innate responsibility to nurture?\nI do not think  that the female of the human race has the responsibility for the ovum, it is biological reality. And the fact that you address it as an \"assumption\" makes me question your good sense. In addition, your position has a much greater flaw than mine ever could: You think you know God's plan.  I hate to break it to you, but you do not.\n \n \nGoing on your posts, this is a conclusion to your view. \n Suppose that after Eve gave birth to Abel she decided that she did not like him. Now imagine that Adam decides to go on a long trip across the fertile crescent. According to your wrong assumptions, Eve has a responsibility over Abel which includes a license to kill. She can do what she wants with him. She can kill him, she can mutilate him - whatever she wants. She can kill Abel, something that god punished Cain for because it was wrong. ....Not only have you assumed the above scene, but you have assumed that she has this license before or the fall of man. \n \n This is why I started my post before with this statement: A consistant pro-choice view is that a woman would be justified in killing a newborn baby, or \"allowing it to starve\" (to be politically incorrect) if she did not want to offer her bodily resources as nutrition and if there were no other options.\n \n An innate responsibility nurture which includes a license to kill? How rediculous. Please, Howard find some real evidence and a real reason to back up your dogma. Or, you could drop your dogma and attempt reevaluate the issue of abortion in an unbiased manner. If you are using the Torah as your absolute, you'll need to start with what it actually says.\nI lump the rest of your post together because it is so disingenuous as to be silly. You start by implying that you will address my previous post and then you spout the same drivel and avoid addressing that post altogether. \n \n I will ask a simple question, and seeing how you have avoided answering all the others, I fear you will avoid this one as well. Your avoidance simply reveals the arrogance of you position.\n \n Do you believe that you know better than God?",

   "Cone:\n \n \nYour position is that women are endowed with the responsibility of child bearing. From this, you have determined that it is solely her responsibility, and consequently, it is soley her decision whether she should carry the child to term, or terminate its life. I must commend you. You have chosen your words very carefully, but no matter what words you choose to use, your position still holds that no one has the right to restrict one person, the woman, from killing another person, the child, that is living and growing within her.\nNo, my position is that God placed the responsibility for the ovum with the female of our species and neither you nor I know why. Therefore we have no right to assign that responsibility elsewhere.\n \n I repeat in italics:\n \n God placed the responsibility for the ovum with the female of our species and neither you nor I know why. Therefore we have no right to assign that responsibility elsewhere.\n \n Once more with feeling (in italics and bold print):\n \n God placed the responsibility for the ovum with the female of our species and neither you nor I know why. Therefore we have no right to assign that responsibility elsewhere.\n \n Did it penetrate?\n \n \nI know that the Creator did not endow one person with the right to kill another person. You, on the other hand, have assumed that the Creator has endowed one person, the woman, with the right to kill another person, the child.\nDrum role please. This is what I know:\n \n God placed the responsibility for the ovum with the female of our species and neither you nor I know why. Therefore we have no right to assign that responsibility elsewhere.\n \n \nYou are basing your assumption on your own philosophical reflection, not in the words of the Torah.\nI do not assume that the female of the human race has the responsibility for the ovum, it is biological reality. And the fact that you address it as an \"assumption\" makes me question your good sense. \n \n \nAs we have clearly seen throughout this thread, you have failed to reveal where the divine fundamental endowment you assert is to be found. Some text from the Torah backing up your assumption would be enough, yet you have not presented any text. You have merely presented a philosophical reflection upon an observation you could have made even if the Torah didn't exist. So, why try to invoke the Torah as your authority?\nYou need a text from the Torah to make you see that God placed the responsibility for the ovum with the female of our species and neither you nor I know why, but you don't need a text from any scripture to support your contention that God endowed you with the right to assign the responsibility for the ovum to a government? Are you serious?\n \n \nIt is based upon the same rationale that you have asserted in this thread. You have made your observations from a state of nature. Just to be clear, what I mean by this is what rights, responsibilities, etc. exist outside the realm of any government or community. You have looked at the account of Creation, and have reasoned from an observation that because a woman is given the responsibility of child rearing, that she has therefore been entrusted by the Creator to choose how to carry out that responsibility.\n \n Using the same method, I have observed that the state of nature created by the Creator designated the responsibility of ownership to the strongest people. It is quite clear, for why else would the Creater have endowed some men/women with strength, and other men/women with weakness. Shouldn't we trust the Creator with this decision?\nWe should trust the Creator is all ways. What you are saying is completely accurate. The reason is that the Creator made us in his own image, after his likeness and just like he entrusted the collective \"us\" (meaning society and government) with dominion over all things that \"crawl on the earth\", he specifically placed the \"ovum\" inside the woman. It does not crawl on the earth, it is in her womb. Inside the sacred vessel of the female body... neither you nor I know why he did that. Yes, man has dominion over all that crawls on the earth. In the same way that woman has dominion over what crawls inside her body. Like it or not, that is the way he Created it. If he wanted man to have dominion over the ovum he would have had us hatched from eggs.\n \n \nWords, arguments, and belief systems all have consequences. For example, you simply ignored my argument at the beginning of this post because you didn't say the word \"kill!\" But, the consequence of your position as posted in this thread clearly shows your belief that the woman, and only the woman, should decide how to exert that responsibility. But, this position has an underlying assumption: that there is a legitimate choice. By assuming a legitimate choice, you assume that the there are at least two options. The two options are clearly whether to bring the child to term, or end the pregnancy. That is, whether to let the child live, or to ensure that it does not.\nI agree again. However, the \"consequences\" of your position or my position are food for another thread. I need the questions of this thread addressed before moving on to the next. And I will ask a simple question:\n \n Do you think you know better than God?\n \n \nIf the Creator intended that the woman should be able to choose between letting the child live, or ensuring that it does not, then why did it take so long for him to bring about the means necessary to safely execute that choice. \n I congratulate you on your disingenuousness. Why did he wait so long for us to discover penicillin? Or fire for that matter? I am sure that if you focus your brain on it you will realize that we don't know why God does things, just like we don't know why he placed the ovum in women, not men.\n \n \nThus it is clear to see that even the state of nature you are reasoning from would not allow a woman to teminate her pregnancy, it would only allow her to kill the child after its birth.\nI am dazzled once again by your mental back-flips and cartwheels. Why not use that formidable intellect to answer my simple question:\n \n Do you think you know better than God?",

I guess they don't have control or ownership of their bodies.\n \n Is an abortion wresting the fetus's ownership of its body to the mother?\n Do parents OWN their children? I think not.\n The state can take them away if the state thinks that the parents aren't fit.\n \n The state has control and ownership over your body and mine.\n Thankfully the state is mostly benevolent enough to let us live within very broad boundaries. But when we cross those boundaries, the state exercises its ownership and puts us where it wants us, or kills us.\n \n Right now the state has boundaries that allow a mother to kill her fetus in the first trimester. \n \n Since the state in all reality owns the mother (and you and me and the fetus), this can change.\n \n It's sad that this doesn't jibe with the idealism found in the DOI.",

Wade delivered by MR JUSTICE BLACKMUN, decided January 22, 1973\n \n Perhaps you care to read the whole case. It explains that..\n \nThe Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy\n the Court or individual Justices have, indeed, found at least the roots of that right in the...\n\n The court says that a right to privacy (not abortion) had roots in previous decisions but this case kind of put it all together. It is interesting to note that abortion doesn't really seem private in the sense of the word. How you can find a right to privacy in the 9th amendment is beyond me but maybe you care to explain. Moreover, abortion was found to be under the so called right to privacy.\n \n \nI find your malicious accusations and twisting of truth to border on insult.\n \n You claimed that the Supreme Court \"rarely\" heard cases involving taxes. I simply disagreed that 3 out of 70 for 2005 was rare. Here are the cases for 2005 alone.\n \n 3 outta 70 but look at the insane amount of tax cases heard in a year. Most of the tax doctrines were not even created by the Supreme Court but rather the tax court or others below the Supreme Court. So yeah, they barely hear an and only decide cases that conflict from districts courts (normally). Of course you say it is more than the other shares...but that depends on how you break it up. If you say \"tax\" this sure includes a lot of things...we should make a category of \"moral values\" and that would take a lot.\n \n \nThere are many \"rights' not enumerated in the Constitution. There is no right to travel for instance. There is no right to sexual intercourse. That is why the Founders placed the 9th Amendment in there. I do not believe that you have fully thought out the consequences if the right to privacy did not exist.\n It doesn't exist in our constitution. There are many things that are considered \"privacy\" but they are specific examples (like quartering troops). Can you show how the 9th amendment was one of the rights granted by the founders? Can you show how sexual intercourse is a right? I assure you it is not a right because the government can make a law (and they do) restricting sexual intercourse.\n \n \nI find it insulting that you comment on what I wrote without having the courtesy to read it. I said that the court compromised as they usually have done and that, in my opinion, they should have decided that there was a right to privacy or there was not. I did not say that the right to privacy is not supported under the 14th Amendment. Please be more conscientious when you paraphrase what someone said.\n But for the record you believe Roe VS Wade to be a wrongfully decided case...however, you do believe a right to privacy exists in the constitution...which is what Roe vs Wade found (hiding under a rug I assume).\n \n \nAnd the court did just that. This is what they said:\n \n \"It is thus apparent that at common law, at the time of the adoption of our Constitution, and throughout the major portion of the 19th century, abortion was viewed with less disfavor than under most American statutes currently in effect. Phrasing it another way, a woman enjoyed a substantially broader right to terminate a pregnancy than she does in most States today.\" Opinion of the Court on Roe v. Wade delivered by MR JUSTICE BLACKMUN, decided January 22, 1973\n Interesting you mention this...If you read further in the case Blackmun (a self proclaimed God) admits that there were laws in the 19th century saying abortion was illegal. He decided to dismiss these for 3 reasons that he really didn't prove but more speculated on. \n \nTo reach its result, the Court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to the drafters of the Amendment. As early as 1821, the first state law dealing directly with abortion was enacted by the Connecticut Legislature. Conn. Stat., Tit. 20, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 16. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, there were at least 36 laws enacted by state or territorial legislatures limiting abortion. 1 While many States have amended or updated their laws, 21 of the laws on the books in 1868 remain in effect today. 2 Indeed, the Texas statute struck down today was, as the majority notes, first enacted in 1857 and \"has remained substantially unchanged to the present time.\" Ante, at 119.\n \n There apparently was no question concerning the validity of this provision or of any of the other state statutes when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. The only conclusion possible from this history is that the drafters did not intend to have the Fourteenth Amendment withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this matter. \n\n \n \n \n \n \nWith all due respect, you embarrass yourself by misquoting people and making statements that are completely unfounded in fact. I would suggest that you remove the ideological armor that prevents us from engaging in a truly constructive dialogue where I can learn from you and you might learn something from others. We could all use to improve our understanding of truth and I hope that by removing that ideological armor you might be able to help me improve mine.\n With all due respect, you don't seem to show any respect yourself.

   "Since I have been forthright enough to answer your question directly, there is a question I posed to you at the end of my previous post to you and I would appreciate as direct a response to my question as I gave to yours.\n\n I suppose you mean this question:\n \nDo you think you know better than God?\n\n The short of it is this: while I do not know better than God, I would not hesitate for a moment to say that I know better than you.\n \n \nGod placed the responsibility for the ovum with the female of our species and neither you nor I know why. Therefore we have no right to assign that responsibility elsewhere.\n\n Once again, let's evaluate this statement. You have made a biological observation, (i.e. that women give birth to children, not men, or, they have an ovum and men do not), and then have made a philosophical judgment based upon that observation that the Creator has appointed solely the woman the responsibility to choose whether to kill her child or let it live. You further say that it is not legitimate for a government to restrict that right. I say poppycock.\n \n Let's carry out this same exact method of observation and philosophical judgment, only let's choose another biological fact. Let's evaluate this biologicical fact: some people are strong, and others (parapalegics, mentally handicapped, etc.) are not. Now, let's apply the same kind of philosophical judgment from this observation that you did in the statement above. We can infer, then, that because the Creator endowed some people with strength, and others with weakness, that he obviously endowed the strong with the responsibility to care for the weak. It is up to them how they choose to exercise this responsibility, but because this is a divine endowment, nobody has the right to step in and assign the responsibility elsewhere.\n \n Now, suppose that the strong decided to exercise their divine responsibility by taking all those weak people and executing them. This is certainly horrific on it's face, but, because the strong were given the responsibility for the well being of the weak by the Creator, nobody - not government, individuals, or otherwise - has the right to assign the responsibility of the strong to anybody else. And the examples are endless. Simply plug in any biological fact into the divine-endowment meter and, poof! you have another group of people with the divinely endowed right/choice to kill, mistreat, maim, or otherwise opress people, with a corresponding lack of right/choice by the remaining members to curtail that group from exercising their right/choice. I frankly don't see how any government action whatever can be thought legitimate under your framework of biological observation and philosophical judgment.\n \n \nI do not assume that the female of the human race has the responsibility for the ovum, it is biological reality. And the fact that you address it as an \"assumption\" makes me question your good sense.\n\n The fact that you deny that your assumption is just that, an assumption, makes me question your sincerity. And let's be clear, just so you don't again ignore what I have actually said, and contiune playing with straw men.\n \n Your assumption is not in stating the biological observation that the woman has the ovum and men do not. I have never said this, and I am not saying it now. Your assumption is the philosophical judgment you make when trying to assess the meaning of that fact. Need me to say it clearer? Your assumption is not the biological fact, it is the significance of the biological fact. Third time's a charm? Your philosophical judment is an assumption. To deny that this as an assumption, is to render any further discussion/debate useless.\n \n \nYou need a text from the Torah to make you see that God placed the responsibility for the ovum with the female of our species and neither you nor I know why, but you don't need a text from any scripture to support your contention that God endowed you with the right to assign the responsibility for the ovum to a government? Are you serious?\n\n Let's just go ahead and do away with the Torah and God. Your position does not need either because, as I have pointed out, it rests solely upon the legs of personal observation and philosophical judgment, not on the Creator or the Torah.\n \n \nWe should trust the Creator is all ways. What you are saying is completely accurate. The reason is that the Creator made us in his own image, after his likeness and just like he entrusted the collective \"us\" (meaning society and government) with dominion over all things that \"crawl on the earth\", he specifically placed the \"ovum\" inside the woman. It does not crawl on the earth, it is in her womb. Inside the sacred vessel of the female body... neither you nor I know why he did that. Yes, man has dominion over all that crawls on the earth. In the same way that woman has dominion over what crawls inside her body. Like it or not, that is the way he Created it. If he wanted man to have dominion over the ovum he would have had us hatched from eggs.\n\n Let's just go ahead and do away with the Torah and God. Your position does not need either because, as I have pointed out, it rests solely upon the legs of personal observation and philosophical judgment, not on the Creator or the Torah.",

You have posed a question which contains a wrong assumption and demanded that reasonable people answer this question. \n \n Howard, I hate to break it to you but it is impossible to use the Torah as a basis for the justification of killing the unborn. Nice try though. If you are just pretending to hold the Torah as your absolute i suggest you find another religion that would provide a basis for abortion and justify your personal dogma regarding the issue (the meaningless religion of secular humanism would be an excelent choice to as it gives life no meaning to life and assumes that there is no moral absolute). \n ....Or if you value truth, truly hold the Torah as your absolute and reevalute this issue in light of the Torah. You might start at the passage in exodus that says \"thou shalt not murder\" (the basis that governments have stood on to justify imposing penalties to deter those from disobeying this commantment). \n \n Now, I pose to you one question:\n Why have you chosen to make the wrong assumption that the Creator found in the Torah bestowed upon humans a responsibility to nurture their young that includes a license to murder them as well?",

   "Howard, \n do you find it interesting that the Creator you have falsely portrayed spoke these things through the prophet Isaiah?\n \n \"Chapter 9 For a child will be born for us, a son will be given to us, and the government  will be on His shoulders. He will be named Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. \n The dominion will be vast, and its prosperity will never end. \n He will reign on the throne of David and over his kingdom,\n to establish and sustain it with justice and righteousness from now on and forever. The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will accomplish this.\" \n \n Which brings up another point...He established David as king forever over Israel. How is that for a Creator whom you have portrayed as one who does not give government authority. There is a passage in the Hebrew texts where king Solomon (David's Son) must make choice regarding this nurturing relationship you have so horribly misinterpreted. Two women come to Him laying claim to a newborn child. Solomon (that is the government) assume authority by deciding who is the real mother.\n \n And there are many many many more examples. The Creator found in the Torah is all about Righteous Government and He even established it.\n \n So I ask you a question:\n Why have you chosen to misrepresent the God of the Torah and imply that He does not give governments authority over men?",

That is not my position. I never said that and I challenge you to find those words in any of my posts. You distort and misrepresent and people should not allow you to get away with it.\n\n Ok, show me the flaw in logic. Perhaps I have misunderstood something. It is your position that, because God placed the ovum in the female and not the male and nobody knows why, then nobody - not the government or another person - can rightfully step in to regulate the responsibility a woman has in how she exercises her responsibility. Among other things, this responsibility includes the decision of whether she should terminate her pregnancy (hence, the killing of another human being) or continue to let it live.\n You further state that you do not know why God put the ovum in the female and not the male. But, you then offer your thoughts as to why He did, and you thoughts allow for the possibility that the woman should be able to terminate her pregnancy (hence, the killing of another human being). If you do not know the answer to a question, but you offer an answer anyhow, why would you disagree that your answer to that question is merely a guess?\n My point in the coin flip analogy is meant to reinforce the fact that answering a question which you do not know the answer to is simply a guess, nothing more and nothing less.\n \n \nSecond:\n \n You quote me saying I do not know the mind of God and then you equate my thougt with a claim of knowledge.\n\n Not sure exactly what you're getting at here. Are you saying that you only think that you cannot know the mind of God? \n \nThen you say:\n \nDid you or did you not say those two statements that I quoted? I put the the quotes in a hyperlink in case there was any doubt. I did not distort what you said, I quoted word for word what you said.

That is not ridicule?\n\n Again, the analogies were meant to reinforce the fact that your answer to a question to which you have already said you did not know the answer to is just a guess. I wasn't ridiculing you (i.e., I was not ridiculing you for guessing), I was saying that I refuse to accept a mere guess on an issue that involves whether we allow another person to terminate their pregnancy (hence, allowing them to kill another human being), or not. \n \n \nThird:\n \n I said I did not know the mind of God and then I wrote about what I thought. You attacked me saying:\n Quote:\n \nFrom a person who admits they do not know the answer, why would anyone take you seriously when you try to answer the question?\n\n Then you go on to say what you think.\n Quote:\n \nHere's what I think, since it apparently hasn't been clear enough. God did not endow one person with the right to murder another person. Out of all the possible reasons why he placed the ovum in the woman, I am sure that it wasn't to allow her the choice of whether to kill a person or not.

I am sure that God did not intend to hand over the authority to choose whether to endow humans with inalienable rights to women.\n\n So either you are just as guilty of \"guessing\" as I am, and should not be taken seriously as well, or you think you know the mind of God. You claim knowledge about what God did not do and what \"rights\" he did not bestow, and you are sure of the reasons he did not do things, sure of what God did not intend. For one who claims not to know the mind of God, you sure claim a lot of knowledge.\n\n Ok, replace the word \"think\" in my post with the word \"know.\" I thought it would be clear enough that I was not guessing when I use words like \"I am sure that it wasn't to allow her the choice...\" \"I am as sure of this as I am that...God did not intend that the strong should rule the weak...\" \"I am sure that God did not intend...\" \n Also, just for the record, I did say the following: I know that the Creator did not endow one person with the right to kill another person. I have a little more to say on this, but I'll post it under your final thought.\n \n \nAnd through it all you avoid the same questions I asked earlier.\n\n First of all, it was my ultimate position from the very beginning that we must come to a conclusion of who the Creator that we are talking about is before we can even look into your claim. But, you chose not to answer this question. So we had to try to discuss this issue with the necessary handicap that there is no authoritative answer. I, by the way, disagree that there is no authoritative answer to the question. But, that is not the discussion here.\n \n Second of all, you have asked me a question: \"Why do you think that the Creator decided to place the ovum in the female and not the male.\" Two things about this: first, this is fundamentally a theological question. You have endeavored to answer this theological question with a personal philosophical reflection. The true answer to your question must come from the authority of the Creator. Hence, I hold that to answer this question correctly, one must turn to a source where the Creator has spoken. Do you now see why we must come to a conclusion about who the Creator is before we can answer questions about why He would/would not choose to do something? Secondly, I did answer your question by issuing a hypothetical. I'll repost it here.\n \n \nYou have made a biological observation, (i.e. that women give birth to children, not men, or, they have an ovum and men do not), and then have made a philosophical judgment based upon that observation that the Creator has appointed solely the woman the responsibility to choose whether to kill her child or let it live. You further say that it is not legitimate for a government to restrict that right. I say poppycock.\n \n Let's carry out this same exact method of observation and philosophical judgment, only let's choose another biological fact. Let's evaluate this biologicical fact: some people are strong, and others (paraplegics, mentally handicapped, etc.) are not. Now, let's apply the same kind of philosophical judgment from this observation that you did in the statement above. We can infer, then, that because the Creator endowed some people with strength, and others with weakness, that he obviously endowed the strong with the responsibility to care for the weak. It is up to them how they choose to exercise this responsibility, but because this is a divine endowment, nobody has the right to step in and assign the responsibility elsewhere.\n \n Now, suppose that the strong decided to exercise their divine responsibility by taking all those weak people and executing them. This is certainly horrific on its face, but, because the strong were given the responsibility for the well being of the weak by the Creator, nobody - not government, individuals, or otherwise - has the right to assign the responsibility of the strong to anybody else. And the examples are endless. Simply plug in any biological fact into the divine-endowment meter and, poof! you have another group of people with the divinely endowed right/choice to kill, mistreat, maim, or otherwise oppress people, with a corresponding lack of right/choice by the remaining members to curtail that group from exercising their right/choice. I frankly don't see how any government action whatever can be thought legitimate under your framework of biological observation and philosophical judgment.\n\n \n The bottom line is this.

   "Cone:\n \n \nI would be surprised if you read all of that. I would be even further surprised if you responded to all of it.\nWell, as Gomer Pyle would say, \"Surprise, surprise, surprise!\"\n \n \nOk, show me the flaw in logic. Perhaps I have misunderstood something. It is your position that, because God placed the ovum in the female and not the male and nobody knows why, then nobody - not the government or another person - can rightfully step in to regulate the responsibility a woman has in how she exercises her responsibility.\nI say they have no right to wrest that responsibility from the female. Can they do it? Yes. But it is not a God given right. Just like someone can kill, but it is not a God given right.\n \n \nAmong other things, this responsibility includes the decision of whether she should terminate her pregnancy (hence, the killing of another human being) or continue to let it live.\nLike it or not, God placed that responsibility in the female. To lobby a government to make sure that she carries out her Divine Directive as you think she is supposed is to trust and believe more in a government than in God. \n \n \nYou further state that you do not know why God put the ovum in the female and not the male. But, you then offer your thoughts as to why He did, and you thoughts allow for the possibility that the woman should be able to terminate her pregnancy (hence, the killing of another human being). If you do not know the answer to a question, but you offer an answer anyhow, why would you disagree that your answer to that question is merely a guess?\nIf my answer is a \"guess\", then so is yours, unless you think you know the mind of God.\n \n \nMy point in the coin flip analogy is meant to reinforce the fact that answering a question which you do not know the answer to is simply a guess, nothing more and nothing less.\nWell my questions remain unanswered by you:\n \n Can we agree that neither you nor I know more than the Creator?\n \n Can we agree that the creator placed the ovum in the female of the species?\n \n Can we agree that when the female was created it was with the biological necessities to carry a fertilized ovum and the male is not?\n \n Can we agree that the Creator knew what he was doing when he placed the ovum in the female?\n \n Those are agree or disagree questions, but feel free to side step them as you have been.\n \n \nNot sure exactly what you're getting at here. Are you saying that you only think that you cannot know the mind of God?\nNo, I am saying that I do not know the mind of God and when I say \"I think\" I am expressing a belief, not a concrete knowledge of the mind or reasoning of God.\n \n \nAgain, the analogies were meant to reinforce the fact that your answer to a question to which you have already said you did not know the answer to is just a guess. I wasn't ridiculing you (i.e., I was not ridiculing you for guessing), I was saying that I refuse to accept a mere guess on an issue that involves whether we allow another person to terminate their pregnancy (hence, allowing them to kill another human being), or not.\nYou could have simply apologized for the ridicule, but so what.\n \n \nOk, replace the word \"think\" in my post with the word \"know.\" I thought it would be clear enough that I was not guessing when I use words like \"I am sure that it wasn't to allow her the choice...\" \"I am as sure of this as I am that...God did not intend that the strong should rule the weak...\" \"I am sure that God did not intend...\"\nYou have answered clearly. You have been gifted with much greater knowledge than most. You know the mind of God. \n \n \nFirst of all, it was my ultimate position from the very beginning that we must come to a conclusion of who the Creator that we are talking about is before we can even look into your claim. But, you chose not to answer this question. So we had to try to discuss this issue with the necessary handicap that there is no authoritative answer. I, by the way, disagree that there is no authoritative answer to the question. But, that is not the discussion here.\nNow I understand why. You know the authoritative answer because you know the mind of God. How can anyone dispute the words of someone who knows the mind of God.\n \n \nSecond of all, you have asked me a question: \"Why do you think that the Creator decided to place the ovum in the female and not the male.\" Two things about this: first, this is fundamentally a theological question. You have endeavored to answer this theological question with a personal philosophical reflection. The true answer to your question must come from the authority of the Creator. Hence, I hold that to answer this question correctly, one must turn to a source where the Creator has spoken. Do you now see why we must come to a conclusion about who the Creator is before we can answer questions about why He would/would not choose to do something? Secondly, I did answer your question by issuing a hypothetical. I'll repost it here.\nYou are much more enlightened than I. I am humbled to address one who knows the mind of God.\n \n \nThe bottom line is this. You have chosen an authority for your position by repeating the claim found in the Declaration of Independence that \"they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights...\" You hold that one of these unalienable rights endowed to women is the responsibility to choose whether to complete a pregnancy or terminate it. You argue that we cannot transgress upon that right. And why can't we? Because the woman was endowed that right by the Creator. Your authority is the Creator. Now I pose to you my original question: Which Creator?\nNot to disagree with one so blessed, but I think the bottom line is that you know the mind of God and I do not. Well I must acknowledge my second class status and would not deign to think that I could sufficiently respond to the question given the fact that you know the mind of God and I don't. So, please give me the benefit of your wisdom and enlighten me as to who/what the Creator is. \n \n And given that I am so unenlightened I would beg your indulgence and request that you give me small simple posts to respond to... you know, one point at a time.\n \n \nI would be surprised if you read all of that. I would be even further surprised if you responded to all of it.\nSurprise, surprise, surprise!",

   "Cone:\n I say they have no right to wrest that responsibility from the female. Can they do it? Yes. But it is not a God given right. Just like someone can kill, but it is not a God given right.\n\n How do you know it is not a God given right to kill? Or is this just a belief on your part. Are you claiming to posess some knowledge of the mind of God. Let's state it right. You believe that no one has the God given right to kill. Nothing you have said so far would place this belief into the knowledge category. In fact, everything you have said so far would necessarily mandate that it be placed in the belief category.\n \n \nLike it or not, God placed that responsibility in the female. To lobby a government to make sure that she carries out her Divine Directive as you think she is supposed is to trust and believe more in a government than in God.\n\n The conclusion does not follow. You claim that we do not know the will of God. Therefore, it could be the case that He wants us to lobby a government to make sure that she carries out her \"Divine Directive\" in the way she ought to. In that circumstance, to not lobby a government to make sure that she carries out her \"Divine Directive\" as she ought to would be to trust in the creature instead of the Creator. You cannot rule this possibility out unless you \"...have been gifted with much greater knowledge than most.\" The gift of \"know[ing] the mind of God.\"\n \n \nIf my answer is a \"guess\", then so is yours, unless you think you know the mind of God.\n\n No, my answer is not a guess. The Creator has revealed Himself through nature, the written Word, and His Son.\n \n \nWell my questions remain unanswered by you:\n \n Can we agree that neither you nor I know more than the Creator?\n \n Can we agree that the creator placed the ovum in the female of the species?\n \n Can we agree that when the female was created it was with the biological necessities to carry a fertilized ovum and the male is not?\n \n Can we agree that the Creator knew what he was doing when he placed the ovum in the female?\n \n Those are agree or disagree questions, but feel free to side step them as you have been.\n\n I have left these unanswered? I guess you missed this post, where you make three statments that we both agree upon (notice these three statements end with a '.' and not a '?'. You begin these statements with \"we agree...\"  and this post where I obviously answered the last question. Perhaps you are not properly versed in the uses of the question mark (?) and the period (.)\n \n Your continous accusation that I have failed to answer your questions is laughable. Considering that you have left quite a few questions unanswered yourself, I would say that you keep bringing this false accusation up as a way of ignoring the questions that have posed to you.\n \n \nNo, I am saying that I do not know the mind of God and when I say \"I think\" I am expressing a belief, not a concrete knowledge of the mind or reasoning of God.\n\n No way. You mean \"belief\" does not mean the same thing as \"know?\" Get outta here. I would have never thought...\n \n \nYou could have simply apologized for the ridicule, but so what.\n\n Awww. Did I offend you? emoticon_cry \n \n \nYou have answered clearly. You have been gifted with much greater knowledge than most. You know the mind of God.\n\n I am trying to understand how this quote is consistent with the one right above it. You suggested that I apologize for ridiculing you, yet you do not hesitate to ridicule me? Talk about someone who can dish it out but doesn't want to have to take it.\n \n \nNow I understand why. You know the authoritative answer because you know the mind of God. How can anyone dispute the words of someone who knows the mind of God.\n\n I am trying to understand how this quote is consistent with the one two quotes above this. You suggested that I apologize for ridiculing you, yet you do not hesitate to ridicule me? Talk about someone who can dish it out but doesn't want to have to take it.\n \n \nYou are much more enlightened than I. I am humbled to address one who knows the mind of God.\n\n I am trying to understand how this quote is consistent with the one three quotes above this one. You suggested that I apologize for ridiculing you, yet you do not hesitate to ridicule me? Talk about someone who can dish it out but doesn't want to have to take it.\n \n \n \nNot to disagree with one so blessed, but I think the bottom line is that you know the mind of God and I do not. Well I must acknowledge my second class status and would not deign to think that I could sufficiently respond to the question given the fact that you know the mind of God and I don't. So, please give me the benefit of your wisdom and enlighten me as to who/what the Creator is.\n\n I am trying to understand how this quote is consistent with the one four quotes above this. You suggested that I apologize for ridiculing you, yet you do not hesitate to ridicule me? Talk about someone who can dish it out but doesn't want to have to take it.\n \n \nAnd given that I am so unenlightened I would beg your indulgence and request that you give me small simple posts to respond to... you know, one point at a time.\n\n If you so wish. I will give you small simple posts to respond to.\n [*]Point 1: You suggest that I apologize for ridiculing you.[*]Point 2: Yet, you do not hesitate to ridicule me.[*]Point 3: You are a hypocrite.\n Howard, I perceive that, though your original post essentially invited others to discuss your position, you nonetheless are unwilling to do so. You obviously have had nothing to say except that those posting their thoughts about your position will not answer your questions, something I've already shown to be untrue. I must admit that I am growing impatient with your uncanny ability to post a lot of words that actually say very little. Your insistence upon sidestepping questions that are raised by simply changing the subject or ignoring them altogether belies your intent not to evaluate your own position. And this being the case, it does not seem reasonable to try to contiune a discussion. I will merely become dizzy by running in the same vicious circle: raise a question to Howard, and he'll sidestep it by replying with an accusation that you never answered his. Good strategy if you don't want to open your position up to scrutiny. Bad strategy if you want people to take you seriously, which I now do not.",

   "Chloe:\n \n Let me respond first to the last part of your post.\n \n \nIf you so wish. I will give you small simple posts to respond to.\n 1. Point 1: You suggest that I apologize for ridiculing you. \n 2. Point 2: Yet, you do not hesitate to ridicule me. \n 3. Point 3: You are a hypocrite.\nIf I offended you, I apologize. It is just that I am sometimes so stunned at some of the things you say and at that time I could think of no other way to point out the inconsistency. I never, however, stooped to calling you names, but if I offended, again I apologize.\n \n \nHoward, I perceive that, though your original post essentially invited others to discuss your position, you nonetheless are unwilling to do so....Your insistence upon sidestepping questions that are raised by simply changing the subject or ignoring them altogether belies your intent not to evaluate your own position.... raise a question to Howard, and he'll sidestep it by replying with an accusation that you never answered his\nI suggest you read my posts. You will see that I make a serious effort to answer every question put to me. I do not think that I have sidestepped any questions you have posed. Please site the past questions you posed to me and, if I had not responded to them then, I gladly will now. Also, please let me know where I accused you of anything and I will address that as well.\n \n The parts of your post that were insulting I will, in an effort at civil discourse, ignore. I will start at the top.\n \n \nHow do you know it is not a God given right to kill? Or is this just a belief on your part. Are you claiming to posess some knowledge of the mind of God. Let's state it right. You believe that no one has the God given right to kill. Nothing you have said so far would place this belief into the knowledge category. In fact, everything you have said so far would necessarily mandate that it be placed in the belief category.\nYour first sentence is a question. I answer it here. I know of nothing that indicates that God gave man a \"right\" to kill. If there is evidence to the contrary I will consider it. In answer to your implied question: Yes, it is my \"belief\" that God did not give man a \"right\" to kill. I do, however, know that men do kill. So, yes, you are completely correct that my position on that would be rightly placed in the belief category.\n \n I answered that question of yours, now I pose one to you: Do you \"know\" what rights God gave man, or do you \"believe\" God gave man certain rights?\n \n \nThe conclusion does not follow. You claim that we do not know the will of God. Therefore, it could be the case that He wants us to lobby a government to make sure that she carries out her \"Divine Directive\" in the way she ought to. In that circumstance, to not lobby a government to make sure that she carries out her \"Divine Directive\" as she ought to would be to trust in the creature instead of the Creator. You cannot rule this possibility out unless you \"...have been gifted with much greater knowledge than most.\" The gift of \"know[ing] the mind of God.\"\nI see no question here to me. Since I do not know the mind or will of God, you are correct, I do not and cannot know whether he wants me to lobby a government for something or not.\n \n My query: Do you agree with that? If not, what is your position?\n \n \nNo, my answer is not a guess. The Creator has revealed Himself through nature, the written Word, and His Son.\nI have no response other than a question for my own clarification: Am I correct in my understanding here that when you speak about God's mind and will you know the mind of God and what his will is, and when I speak it is just a guess?\n \n \nYou mean \"belief\" does not mean the same thing as \"know?\" Get outta here. I would have never thought...\nYes, I do mean \"belief\" does not mean the same thing as \"know\". I \"know\" I have a dictionary and I \"know\" that it defines \"belief\" as different than \"know\". However I \"believe\" that you will not find a dictionary that defines them as meaning the same think. \n \n My question: Do you use the words know and believe synonymously?",
