If the problems were worked out, which I'm sure they will be, what would your moral view on it be?\n\n There are a few things I would be concerned about. \n 1) Would we really know what we are doing? From the limited amount I understand about genetics, things may not necessarily be as easy as \"change that piece to change that characteristics\". There is some level of interdependence in the way genes act in our bodies so I would be concerned that there might be unintended consequences to our haphazardly playing around with the human genome.\n 2) Assuming we do know what we are doing, how do we decide what genetic improvements to make and who decides? What criteria do we use to make such decisions? Does society have a say? There are a lot of unsolved social issues that would need to be addressed. Even if we do address them, societies are complex and there may easily be unintended societal consequences to our well intended genetic manipulation of a future population. For example, if we made genetic changes which hugely prolongued people's average lifespan, then how does society care for such a large aged population?\n 3) Even if we could solve all of these issues (which is a huge IF), should we \"play God\", so to speak. I don't have as much of an issue with this as others might. \n 4) The slippery slope: If, say, we agree as a society to make only those genetic changes that reduce birth defects and abnormalities, then what arguements do we present in law to limit genetic manipulation to only that? How do we argue against those who want to push things farther?\n 5) If, in the womb, we change the genes of a fetus with a genetic disorder then, in many cases, we are changing what that fetus will become without its approval (assuming it already has a mental existence). I suppose you could limit genetic manipulation to pre-mental existence or wait until after the person is capable of agreeing to the procedure.\n \n Anyway, there are a host of problems that could arise. I am not saying that the problems may not be solveable. I am just wary of jumping into such a dangerous technology without thinking VERY HARD about what exactly it is that we are doing.",

What criteria do we use to make such decisions? Does society have a say?\n\n \n Probably the best argument. Who are you to decide what is or isn't a good quality?\n \n I think another point is that if you remove the people that you feel have \"bad\" characteristics then you just end up making a new level of where people with \"bad\" charcteristics are. So perhaps 80 IQ was mentally retarded before but with our new improved way of life 120 IQ (equilivant) would be mentally retarded.\n \n After all that you get into moral questions.

I can well imagine that \"designed\" people would have superior characteristics to 'natural\" people and would be given preferential treatment in society. The technology might be just around the corner for parents to design their offspring - i.e. They might want them super intelligent, athletic, etc. Only the rich and otherwise social elites would be able to afford such \"designer\" kids, while the middle class and poor would keep things natural.

We all know that, in reality, people who are smarter, or better looking, or who have a wide range of positive qualities are treated better than those who are not. Currently, such a distribution is determined by a natural distribution of genetics. Artificial tampering with genetics would lead to an artificial distribution which opens up a huge \"can of worms\". \n \n I suppose that one can step back from the idea of \"designer\" people and only use genetic engineering for such things as fixing birth defects. However, even there, I would need to know that the geneticists know what they are doing - i.e. no unforseen side effects - and that we have taken into account societal implications. \n \n Either way, some of these technologies are already here and others are just around the corner so I am glad to see these type of discussions pop up.",

   "There are easier ways to go about a lot of what you suggested, I honestly have no qualms at all about genetic engineering as long as its done sensibly (I intend to make a career out of it afterall). However I think you need to look at the three main suggested uses of it -\n \n 1.) Curing genetic diseases - seriously I can not see how you can argue against this sort of thing, even if its removing the traits from carriers. We're not at risk from becoming too homogenous and thus vunerable to disease,at this scale. The only potential issue is where there is some positive effect from the disease like the well known case of sickle cell anemia, but in a society where this technology is possible its really unlikely that there is going to be something like this that can't be treated otherwise. Worse comes to the worse, what is to stop you changing it back? Most of the diseases we're talking about occur during development and copying an existing genotype to adapt into gene therapy for an adult isn't really that difficult.\n \n 2.) Give people a super immune system - this is really not that possible, partly due to the way the immune system works (most of the symptoms of every disease are caused by the immune system itself) and partly because bacteria and viruses evolve quicker than medicine. The technology could be used in medicine (we can do this now really, making non pathogenic strains or just the antigens for immunisation), but super-immune systems are out.\n \n 3.) Make everyone a genius - again, there is no real need for this. Best way to think of this is like height, we are pretty much the tallest now as we've been throughout history as without an overabundance of food and a lack of parasites, you will not grow to your full height. Its not a simple 'tall gene' type thing, nor is intelligence. Mental diseases and retardation are things you could probably fix, these people aren't just at the bottom end of the normal distribution of intelligence but below that. They have a mental disease, they aren't stupid.\n What you really need is to concentrate on creating the environment where people can fully reach their potential, something that is far further beyond us at the moment than the genetic engineering is. Except in very special cases (that often border on the disease level), any inteligence boosting treatments would not really be noticeable unless accompanied by special programs designed to take advantage of it. If you want super intelligence, cybernetics is the way to go rather than gene therapy or genetic engineering.",

What would you think of it? \n\n \n I don't see anything wrong with it in terms of it being used as a way to prevent a certain disease, such as if the family has a history of a certain disease, preventing their child from having this gene can only be a good thing for them. As far as intelligence, or looks as I believe they can now allow you to choose, I don't really see it as necessary. I personally believe that intelligence has more to do with the way a child is raised and taught in school and at home than any part of his or her DNA, and if the child was chosen because the sperm was from a doctor and egg from a scientist and the child ends up doing not so brilliantly in school, have a normal IQ and becomes an office worker would they disappoint their parents? As far as looks are concerned I suppose the only reason it could be used is to have the child resembling the parents, and if you have enough money to do it then why not? It's a bit of a waste of money to me though, except in terms of ensuring your child won't have a disease that runs in the family, which causes a lot of concern for families.",
