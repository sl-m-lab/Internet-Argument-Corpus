   "The question is quite simple, yet I'm sure in this day and age. Most reading this think I am going to head into a political argument. Much to the effect that liberals are killing America or that conservatives are neo-Nazis. Rather I am asking a generalized question and one that few focus on. What happened to the people that founded America?\n \n Today's political process is a simple one, demonize the enemy. Our politics have turned into a bloodless war. Complete with propaganda, hate, and finger pointing. We must ask ourselves how we have gotten to this point and how we were when we started.\n \n The American government was founded on humility. That is the principle value that it was founded on. The goal was for power to be checked in all ways. How did that come to be? One man stands above the rest as being one of the most humble servants of the American Revolution, George Washington. This man did everything he could for his country short of giving his life, and he would have given that if fate requested it. \n \n After the American forces had beaten the British, growing dissent started to fill the army seriously threatening to create a coup. Washington saw this and felt it necessary to remind the men of what they fought for. In one sentence he was able to end the dissent. He reached into his pocket to produce a letter from a member of congress. He looked at it but said nothing. The men became confused. Then he reached into his pocket for reading glasses, only the closest to him knew he needed them now, he had never worn them in public. He said \"Gentlemen, will you permit me to put on my spectacles, for I have not only grown gray but almost blind in the service of my country.\" It is said that not a man in the room didn't have a tear in his eye. \n \n After the war when Washington had huge public support he went to congress and handed over his power as supreme commander. His duty was over and he simply left. My question is a simple one. Do we have a person in power today that would do that? Once he finally accepted the job of president, through no demand of his own, he set out with congress to construct a government that would be built around power being distributed. No man would become to powerful. No body of members would hold to much sway. He did this while he knew that if he wanted, he could be an undisputed ruler.\n \n We have lost that today. We have lost everything that it was founded on and the ability to work together as they could. Today's government is opposite of what the founding fathers wanted. It is all about getting control for your political party. We must not forget that once that party does become the powerful that they refuse to work with anyone that disagrees with them. Thus our current situation is that of power hungry despots in our leading positions.\n \n I am not talking about Republicans, as I'm sure Democrats are now thinking. Both parties want the same thing, to rule. Do you really think the Democrats would willingly ask the Republicans to come help them make policy and national agenda? Of course not! Yet they point the finger at the Republicans for doing just that. Everyone is so quick to label themselves that they loose their identity. I'm a Democrat so I must be against everything the Republican Party says. I'm a Republican so I must be against everything the Democratic Party says. We have lost the Americans. Those people that both groups claim to be. The people that are humble servants. The people that can sit down and put their differences aside for awhile and work together so that they can stand united behind issues that really matter.\n \n The truth is that this partisan bickering has blinded us. The Republicans are so blind that they refuse to accept that Iraq could ever fail. The Democrats are so blinded that they refuse to accept that Iraq could work out. The truth is simple, we have no clue, and no one does. Bush sold us a war on false accusations. Whether he knew it or not doesn't really matter. I honestly believe he felt it was the right thing to do and even if he knew the information was faulty he did what he thought was right. However he refuses to accept that this war might turn out bad. We need some honesty. I know that personally I would have huge respect for the man if he got up and said \"Listen, Iraq is far from being stable right now. We cannot know what will happen in the future. All I can do is fight my hardest to make Iraq a success for us and the Iraqi people. Nothing can be certain but I will continue to fight in what I believe will make this nation safer and what will bring a happy conclusion to the Iraqis. I urge the American people to continue to support this cause for the greater good of this nation. We don't know what the road has in store for us but together we can fight to make that road come to a happy ending.\" Whether you support the war or not you can at least respect the man and even be willing to fight for a good outcome regardless of if you think it was right to invade.\n \n I am not bashing Bush here because the honest truth is that Democrats would do the same thing. It is not a man I am questioning, it is not a party I am questioning, it is our current situation which has been this way for at least 100 years now. We need some reformers. Men that are not afraid to sit down together regularly and talk. Democrats, Republicans, and even smaller parties such as the Green party and the Libertarians. Just because one party has a controlling interest in the country does not mean they should throw up a wall to all outside opinion. I hope most Americans agree with me. This power struggle and labeling has gone too far. We are all Americans when it comes right down to it. We are not liberal, or conservative, those are preferences that influence us but should not create a war between us. We can still work together. There is a huge common ground among the moderates of all parties.\n \n Do you agree with me? Have you not had enough by now? This with us or against us policy is ripping the country in half. Do you not think we need more George Washingtons, more people that are strong leaders but humble enough to always be able to work with others? I know it may be impossible now. Simply a dream. Am I the only one that wishes for that dream though?",

Is he not an example to the likely solution though? As growing numbers of people in America get sick of this bickering between two extreme groups, they will look to centre-ground polititians with a tolerance of differing views to fill the void and provide an alternative form of government.\n \n It might not be a slow process either. There was an interesting article in the Observer newspaper (a British left-wing Sunday paper) that suggests this backlash may even happen during this presidency (http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1514898,00.html)",

   "Really good post, I think it's pretty simple. Both parties want to make the country better in their eyes. In Republicans' eyes this country would be better without gay marriage, without abortion, with more states' rights, with less gun control, while Democrats think the opposite. They both fight for this blindly because it is the most important thing for them. Soon they hear the other party disagreeing with them which gets in the way of what, in their opinion, will make the country better. They make the conclusion that the other party is against America and realize that the only way to solve this is to gain power. Both fight for power until they don't care by what means they do it. They will ignore and oppose everything the other party says blinded to the fact that they may be wrong. \n \n In the short term, I don't think there's much of a chance of a candidate who will understand and work together with the other side, it isn't very popular within the party. What Democrat would get a nomination if they were against gay marriage, and what Republican would get elected that was pro gun control? Trying to talk about the differences would be perceived as weakness. Both parties want people who will get elected and push their agenda in the government. The only reason someone would do such a thing would be to get elected, and once they were elected, they would stop cooperating with the other party and continue to push their own agenda.",
