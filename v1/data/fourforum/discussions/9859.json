When I look at all of human history, I rarely find a case where the government did something that was in the best interests of the people.\n Government is all about control. And people that are afraid are easy to control. Just give them something to be scared about (like terrorism or global warming) and tell the sheeple that the government will protect them, because the government knows best.\n\n \n Now we get to the crux of the matter. My own theory for why people question GW is *because* government has suddenly got involved. Immediately our authority aversion kicks in and we shy away from what governent believes. But that doesn't make sense. Scientists have been trying (with little success) since the '80's to get governments to take the GW threat seriously. Now, when the evidence points so firmly towards the manmade cause, they are finally doing so.\n \n \nSecondly, even the rigged UN report says that there is a 90% chance that global warming is man made. So basically that leaves a 10% chance that it isn't man made.\n\n \n You play those odds? Good luck. I wouldn't take them on a horse race let alone the fate of our only home.",

   "You can't possibly think that climate scientists missed this?! CO2 in the atmosphere is a positive feedback system.

You probably never heard about it until now, since obviously any scientist revealing this kind of information is fringe-element crank you can just disregard.\n \n And yes, that's right, it shows CO2 is not THE cause, and it destroys THE central piece of evidence for it even being A cause. Bear that in mind next time you assume that temperature changes MUST be due to CO2.\n \n \nGenerally those challenges come from other scientists not from random punters on a message board touting opinion as it if it had any bearing on reality.

   "A number of points spring to mind. Firstly, which scientists are you talking about? GW has been known about since the 19th century. Secondly, there was still widespread use of suplhur-based chemicals 30 years ago which DID cause cooling. Thirdly, whilst on the one hand people are talking about how ideas get turned over, in science, for better ones when better data and more accurate equipment becomes available, we seem to be exempting GW from the same courtesy.\n\n I'm talking about the scientific community at large. Newsweek and TIME magazine both did articles about it.\n And as for you sulfur argument, I suggest you look at the current industrial powerhouses India and China and see how much sulfur they still spew into the atmosphere. According to your logic the Earth should still be cooling because of it.\n \n \nWhy are you not convinced? Do you have some evidence that these people don't know what they're doing? It might well be quite complicated to work out *exactly* what's going to happen but doesn't it just stand to reason that pumping vast amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere would raise the temperature? Otherwise, what's your proposed mechanism for it not doing so?\n\n I suggest that we first take a more in depth look at the suns influence on the Earths climate before we start levying eco-taxes and start to take away more of peoples rights.\n \n \nArrogant? Is it arrogant to think we might know what happened fractions of seconds after the Big Bang? Or what goes on in the heart of a star? Or to model how things work at sub-atomic levels? Calling it arrogance is a weird sort of ad hominem against the whole of science.\n\n So if I question one part of science I question all of it? Talk about disingenious debate...\n \n \nWell there aren't 'a lot of them'. I also have a working hypothesis that if one has to scrabble around to find \"experts\" to the extent of including honorary professors, mathematicians and (God help us!) engineers, that list is unlikely to be worth the bandwidth it's written on.\n\n Has it ever occurred to you that the vast majority of scientists get funding from the government and as such have a conflict of interest with regards to politicized science? \n \n \nAnd you speak of arrogance?! Just when would you be satisified?\n\n I'll be satisfied when parties on both sides of the argument can be heard without one party being ridiculed by the other.\n Anybody who makes up their mind without hearing both sides of the argument is a fool.\n \n \n \nNo it wasn't. Unless you've been living in a cave, we've been talking about global warming in the mainstream since at least the '80's. \n\n And what did we do about it in the 80's and 90's? Nothing.\n Only around the same time that UN report was released (give or take a few years) did national governments really start to act (Kyoto was a farce) and did the global warming movement get into high gear.\n These days it's all about CO2 (taxes), global warming, eco this, eco that, and of course my favourite, carbon trading.\n 5 Years ago that wasn't the case.\n \n \nPossibly because we've known about that for about 150 years. The sun's effect in the way you're talking about runs in 21,000 year cycles - the warming we're seeing is far to quick to be its result.\n\n Actually the suns has many cycles, the most common one being the 10-11 years cycle.\n \n And if you want quick warming how about 10.000 years ago when the Earths temperature rose 6 degrees Celsius in a decade.\n \n \nNow we get to the crux of the matter.

I'm not suggesting CO2 rises now are because of the medieval warm period (perhaps some of them are, but certainly a lot are manmade), I'm suggesting the primary source of evidence for man-made global warming is no longer a source at all, it hasn't been since 2003, yet it still makes its way into Al Gore's documentaries and to this very thread as an apparent \"proof\" of CO2 as the driving force behind climate change.",

   "Without going and looking up the figures for the energy levels of a CO2 molecule, and how many CO2 molecules there are in the atmosphere, and factoring in the curvature of the earth (plus a few hundred other variables) I can't provide an exact figure. That's why we pay research climatologists to build models, because it's complex. You were claiming that warming precedes CO2 release. You've provided one instance, a situation completely different to the present day, and no reason to suppose that this is the orientation of cause and effect in the current climate, which was very much what you implied previously\n \n I don't recall specifying any cost in lives, I fail to see how getting power from renewable sources instead of fossil fuels need cost any lives. There is no need to stop all carbon emissions, just make sure that they come from renewable sources. Rampant global warming, however, has the potential to cost millions of lives through consequent flooding, famine and disease. If you want to be utilitarian about it, the balance should be struck when inaction will cause more deaths than action.\n \n I don't know why you feel the need to attack this strawman enivronmentalism that demands a return to the stone age. Wind, wave, solar and tidal power have the potential to sustain modern technology and standards of living, as well as support the development of poorer countries. And since when did Mr. Free Market become concerned about the developing world?",

   "You've provided one instance, a situation completely different to the present day, and no reason to suppose that this is the orientation of cause and effect in the current climate, which was very much what you implied previously\n\n \n I didn't imply that previously, I was responding to a previous poster who linked to a graph showing correlation between CO2 and temperature over hundreds of thousands of years, indicating his belief this was a clear sign CO2 is and has always been the primary driver of global temperature, just as Al Gore does in his documentary. It has not been, historically the situaton has been reversed.\n \n As for whether it is still the case now, that's a different question.\n \n \nAnd since when did Mr. Free Market become concerned about the developing world?\n\n \n Being in favour of the free market doesn't mean you hate the developing world, or the poor. I could just as easily claim that since you're a socialist you hate humanity.\n \n \nI fail to see how getting power from renewable sources instead of fossil fuels need cost any lives.\n\n \n If you ignore the costs of fighting global warming you will be unable to come to any rational conclusion about what should be done about it. Any increase in costs of living will cost lives, especially in the third world, but still too in the first. Although the lives lost in the first world will tend to be more among the elderly, so perhaps we can weigh them less than the more demographically diverse groups of people affected by flooding or disease.\n \n \nIf you want to be utilitarian about it, the balance should be struck when inaction will cause more deaths than action.\n\n \n And when would that be?\n \n My final question for you Jo, if you're really so concerned about global warming, and its potentially disastrous effects, why is it you seem even more concerned about nuclear power? Is there something you know we don't? I've heard the whole spiel about \"its not cost-effective compared to wind power\" before, and frankly I don't believe you.\n \n So basically what have we concluded, we can't come to an exact conclusion about how much the earth is warming via CO2 emissions, let alone what the human cost, if any, of that warming is likely to be, let alone how much we could expect to reduce that warming by taking a particular initiative, and what human loss could be prevented, and we don't know what the costs of that would be. All we have are some highly suspect models that can't even accurately simulate historical trends.\n \n The only thing I conclude from the global warming debate is that utilitarianism is worthless.",

In case *you* hadn't noticed, the US doesn't make up the whole of 'the west'. But China and India are indeed churning out a lot of sulphurous gas. This is not a good thing. It's rather toxic and causes acid rain. Chances are they'll start using cleaner technology when people start keeling over dead and their water supplies are fouled. 2) Global warming is not a homogenous effect.

   "Yes, the fact. The historical trend of CO2 following changes in temperature is now well established.\n\n \n The fact that it's a positive feedback system is well established. \n \n \nOh wait, its because you don't think you need data, since its arrogant to look at the facts yourself, better instead to rely on consensus.\n\n \n Have a word with yourself. It's arrogant to think that you know better than professional scientists. It's arrogant to think that your Googling somehow trumps their research.\n \n \nIt is published, you just haven't heard of it before now, because it doesn't support the MMGW position.\n\n \n Okay. And why hasn't anyone else heard of it?\n \n \nGiven the complexity of the climate system, how could you predict with any confidence that proposed restrictions on CO2 output would change the rate of climate change sufficiently enough to justify their costs. We're talking about obscene amounts of money, enough perhaps to cure AIDS, cancer, to develop the third world, but instead the imperative is to manipulate CO2 output in some way when it is unclear this manipulation will have much an effect at all.\n\n \n You mean all that money we were using to save the world *before* we knew there was a problem with the climate? The fact that *you're* unsure that the measures being taken will have any effect, or are even important, frankly doesn't carry any weight over here. \n \n \nThat you aren't aware of published data doesn't mean it doesn't exist.\n\n \n Invisible pink unicorns spring to mind.\n \n ABE: I'd also suggest that arguing that the measures we take to combat global warming being the cause of widespread death in the developing world are something of a red herring. Given that Global Warming is unequivocally happening, if we *aren't* the cause of it, then we're pretty much screwed anyway.
