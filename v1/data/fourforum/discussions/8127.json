   "I started something on a thread in the Crime Debates that would be better suited here in the History debates. It concerns the dropping of the Atomic Bomb onto Japan in World War II. I say that there were innocent lives loss among civilians. The fact that the leader was \"worshiped\" was a forced regime. The only reason for \"worshiping\" the leader was because it was the law. I say that there were both advantages and disadvantages to the dropping of the Atom bomb. I'll call this the good, the bad, and the ugly the Atom bomb. While there were many advantages to using the A-bomb (like the end of a war) I say there were also numerous disadvantages like the Cold War, the loss of innocent lives that the government claims they didn't realize would happen, and a whole new sense of fear like the world had never experienced before.\n \n \n (Now to give a link to here from the crime thread.)",

After he and his unit helped knock out Hitler they would have gone to Japan. Ask him if dropping the bomb was the right thing.\n Reply With Quote\n\n \n Russia had every intention of invading Japan. It started with a massive sweep across Manchuria. Just days Before Nagasaki, Soviet troops had taken prisoner roughly 300,000 Japanese soldiers.\n \n Aside from the U.S.S.R.'s actual campaign in China, there's the Yalta Conferece:\n \n Roosevelt came to Yalta seeking early Soviet participation in the war against Japan. Fearing that Japan would not surrender easily, Roosevelt promised Stalin the return of territories lost following the Russo-Japanese War of 1905. Stalin agreed to declare war on Japan, but only ninety days after the surrender of Germany. With the surrender of Japan in August 1945, which followed the dropping of nuclear bombs by the United States on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Soviet Union obtained the promised territories after expending minimal military effort.\n \n No doubt at all that the nukes dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the final nails needed to seal the coffin, but Japan was already going to surrender. The Japanese military administration had no problem fighting against the Americans, because they knew the United States was merciful toward captured prisoners and did not kill civilians. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, was notorious for boundless motivation to win at, literally, all costs, regardless of the millions of men they lost. Japan thought that the Soviet Union would show no mercy, and they had no wish to see if their predictions would hold true. The surrender of Japan was purely a matter of time.\n \n Now, in all fairness, the US did not know that back then, so whether or not dropping the bombs was a comparatively moral decision or not is irrelevant.\n \n I have no clue where you got the veterans from, though--especially Dick Winters. You don't know what he thinks 60 years after his service in Europe, and even so, it's clear he's a fairly liberal individual. At any rate, what would you expect Winters to say in response to the notion that dropping the nukes was a wrong move? Spit on Jo Bennet? Hardly.",

   "Even after the dropping of the A-Bomb on Hiroshima, Japanese troops were reinforcing Kyushu. \n \n\n Olympic: First off, Frank gives a good capsule description of Operation Olympic, the invasion of Kyushu planned for November 1, and Ketsu-go, the preparations being made to destroy the American invasion force at the beaches. Frank then brings up evidence that during the summer of 1945, the Japanese reinforcement of Kyushu was so fearsome that American planners were beginning to turn against the invasion. By October 15, they now believed, 625,000 troops would be defending Kyushu. On Luzon, Okinawa, and Iwo Jima, the Japanese had shown their willingness to fight almost to the last man, with death tolls running as high as 97 or 98 percent. Meanwhile, they inflicted casualties at the rate of one American for every one or two defenders. To me, that suggests 600,000 Japanese soldiers dead on Kyushu, and upwards of 300,000 Americans killed, wounded, or missing. No wonder Truman wanted the Russians in the war, and no wonder he dropped the atomic bombs.\n \n .....\n National suicide: \"Even though we may have to eat grass, swallow dirt, and lie in the fields, we shall fight on to the bitter end, ever firm in our faith that we shall find life in death\"--so said General Anami, the army minster and one of three (possibly four) hard-liners in the Big Six war cabinet. Given the Japanese requirement for consensus, the military men held veto power over cabinet deliberations. They were backed by officers at all levels of the army and navy: on August 13, Admiral Onishi broke into a government conference to urge: \"Let us formulate a plan for certain victory, obtain the Emperor's sanction, and throw ourselves into bringing the plans to realization. If we are prepared to sacrifice 20,000,000 Japanese lives in a special [suicide] effort, victory will be ours!\"\n From a review of the book Downfall : The End of the Imperial Japanese Empire  by Richard Frank \n \n http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/067941424X/103-0003382-3744661?familyfilter=1&v=glance&n=283155\n \n\n \n \n \n\n The MIS report of 2 August showed that estimated military manpower on Kyushu had reached 534,000. (45) As substantial as this increase was, it still did not include the full personnel of the recently confirmed eleventh combat division because analysts believed this division was not yet fully deployed. Nor did the new estimate include any manpower for the two suspected but yet-to-be-confirmed divisions. These forces together represented the potential for another 40,000 troops. \n \n ........\n MacArthur's practice was to not allow intelligence to interfere with his aims, and his history of complaints about Willoughby's reports resulted mainly from their contradiction of his own estimates and preferred courses of action. His denigration of the reported buildup on Kyushu directly contradicted the performance record of his G-2 under Willoughby. In those instances during MacArthur's Pacific campaign when the ULTRA-derived assessments were not entirely accurate, the errors tended to be on the low side. (87) \n \n In this instance, postwar information would show that there had in fact been 14 Japanese combat divisions on Kyushu--and that intercepted communications had identified all of them. The exact locations of a few of the newest arrivals had not been determined at the time of the war's end, but it is quite likely that, once their existence on Kyushu had been confirmed, finding their locations would have been accomplished within a few weeks at most. Japanese documents obtained after the war showed that at the time the US Military Intelligence Service was estimating 600,000 troops on Kyushu, there were 900,000 soldiers assigned to its defense.

Monday, February 16, 1998. \n ________________________________________\n B. TSUTSUI: Our next speaker, D. M. Giangreco, is an editor for the US Army's professional journal, Military Review, published by the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Giangreco has lectured widely on national security matters. An award-winning author of five books on military and political subjects, he has also written\n extensively for various national and international publications on such topics as the Falkland Islands' sovereignty question, decentralization of the Soviet Air Force command and control structure, Persian Gulf pipeline construction to circumvent the Strait of Hormuz bottleneck, and the human interface with rapidly changing technologies. Several of his works have\n been translated into French, German and Spanish. Giangreco's most recent books have also been published in Japanese, and the next one, Dear Harry on the correspondence of \"everyday Americans\" with the Truman White House will be released in fall 1998 [NOTE: see Amazon.com for more on DEAR HARRY]. Giangreco is also being awarded the Society for Military History's 1998 Moncado Prize for his article \"Casualty Projections for the US Invasions of Japan: Planning and Policy Implications\" published in the July 1997 Journal of Military History by the George C. Marshall Center and VMI.\n \n GIANGRECO: Thank you. It's great to be here today.\n \n The sudden and unanticipated conclusion of the Pacific War with the dropping of atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was greeted with joy by all Americans, and especially by the more than three and a half million soldiers, sailors and Marines slated to invade Japan. These forces were not only to come from the Pacific; First Army, which had pummeled its way from Normandy to the heart of Germany, and Eighth Air Force, based in England, were on the way as well. But morale was not good among veterans of the Ardennes, Guadalcanal, and other campaigns. As James Jones later wrote: \"What it must have been like to some old-timer buck sergeant . . . [knowing] that he very likely had survived this far only to fall dead in the dirt of\n Japan's Home Islands, hardly bears thinking about.\"\n MacArthur's staff had twice come up with figures exceeding 100,000 casualties for the opening months of combat on the southern island of Kyushu, a figure which some historians largely succeeded in contrasting favorably- and quite mistakenly- with President Harry Truman's much-derided post-war statement that Marshall had advised him at Potsdam that casualties\n from both the Kyushu and Honshu invasion operations could range from 250,000 to one million men. \n \n Truman and Marshall were intimately familiar with losses in the Pacific during the previous year: over 200,000 casualties from wounds, fatigue and disease, plus 10,000 American dead and missing in the Marianas, 5,500 dead on and around Leyte, 9,000 dead during the Luzon campaign, 6,800 at Iwo Jima, 12,600 at Okinawa, and 2,000 killed in the unexpectedly vicious fighting on Peleliu. Both also knew that, save for some operations around New Guinea, real casualties were routinely outpacing estimates and the gap was widening. They also knew that while America always emerged victorious, operations often were not being completed as rapidly as planned- with all the added cost in blood and treasure that such lengthy campaigns entailed.\n \n Leyte is a perfect example. Leyte was to the Luzon campaign what the Kyushu invasion was to the capture of Honshu's Kanto Plain and Tokyo, a preliminary operation to create a huge staging area. Today, we can recall MacArthur wading ashore triumphantly in the Philippines. But what Truman and Marshall knew only too well was that MacArthur was supposed to have retaken Leyte with four divisions and have eight fighter and bomber groups striking from the island within 45 days of the initial landings. However, nine divisions and twice as many days into the battle, only a fraction of that airpower was operational because of unexpected terrain conditions (and this on an island which the United States had occupied for over forty years). The fighting on the ground not gone as planned. The Japanese even briefly isolated Fifth Air Force headquarters and also captured much of the Burauen airfield complex before reinforcements pushed them back into the jungle.\n \n Now, some historians have stated incredulously that Marshall's estimate of up to one million casualties for the invasion of Japan significantly exceeded those sustained in Europe. But while the naval side of the Pacific War displayed the broad, sweeping moves so loved by historians, land combat in the Pacific had little in common with the maneuver warfare that went a long way toward keeping casualties comparatively low in France and the central German Plain. The closest European commanders came after D-Day to the corps-level combat which was the stock and trade of Army and Marine divisions in the Pacific was the prolonged fighting in the Huertgen Forest and Normandy's hedgerows- close-in, infantry-intensive slugfests that produced many bodies on both sides. It is also important to note that when they went to Potsdam, Truman and Marshall knew that total US casualties had recently exceeded the one and a quarter million mark- a number these historians find unfathomable- what's more the bulk of the losses occurred in just the previous year of fighting against Germany.\n \n There were plenty of estimates which confidently asserted that strategic bombing, blockade, or both- even the invasion of Kyushu alone- would bring Japan to its senses, but no one was able to provide General Marshall with a convincing explanation of just how long that would take. The millions of Americans poised to take part in the largest invasion in history, as well as those supporting them, could only stay poised for so long. Leaders in both Washington and Tokyo knew this just as well as their theater commanders in the Pacific. After learning of the bomb, MacArthur ignored it save for considering how to integrate the new weapon into plans for tactical operations at Kyushu and Honshu if Tokyo was not forced to the surrender table. Nimitz was of a similar mind. On being told that the bomb would become available in August, he reputedly remarked, \"In the meantime I have a war to fight.\"\n \n On 29 July 1945, there came a stunning change to an earlier report on enemy strength on Kyushu. This update set alarm bells ringing in MacArthur's headquarters as well as Washington because it stated bluntly that the Japanese were rapidly reinforcing southern Kyushu and had increased troop strength from 80,000 to 206,000 men, quote: \"with no end in sight.\" Finally, it warned that Japanese efforts were, quote: \"changing the tactical and strategic situation sharply.\" While the breathless \"no end in sight\" claim turned out to be somewhat overstated, the confirmed figures were ominous enough for Marshall to ponder scraping the Kyushu operation altogether even though MacArthur maintained that it was still the best option available. \n \n Now, this is particularly interesting because, in recent years, some historians have promoted the idea that Marshall's staff believed an invasion of Japan would have been essentially a walk-over. To bolster their argument, they point to highly qualified- and limited- casualty projections in a variety of documents produced in May and June 1945, roughly half a year\n before the first invasion operation, Olympic, was to commence. Unfortunately, the numbers in these documents- usually 30-day estimates- have been grossly misrepresented by individuals with little understanding of how the estimates were made, exactly what they represent, and how the various documents are connected. In effect, it is as if someone during World War II came across casualty estimates for the invasion of Sicily, and then declared that the numbers would represent casualties from the entire Italian campaign. Then, having gone this far, announced with complete confidence that the numbers actually represented likely casualties for the balance of the war with Germany. Of course, back then, such a notion would be dismissed as being laughably absurd, and the flow of battle would speedily move beyond the single event the original estimates- be they good or bad- were for. That, however, was fifty-plus years ago. Today, historians doing much the same thing, win the plaudits of\n their peers, receive copious grants, and affect the decisions of major institutions. [Laughter.]\n \n The limited and cautiously optimistic estimates of May and June 1945 were turned to junk by that intelligence estimate at July's end, and the situation was even more dangerous than was perceived at that time. War plans called for the initial landings on the Home Islands to be conducted approximately 90 days hence. But, as we shall see, the invasion of Kyushu would actually have not been able to take place for anywhere from 120 to 135 days- a disastrous occurrence for the successful outcome of stated US war aims.\n \n Some today assert, in effect, that it would have been more humane to have just continued the conventional B-29 bombing of Japan, which in six months had killed nearly 300,000 people and displaced or rendered homeless over 8 million more. They also assert that the growing US blockade would have soon forced a surrender because the Japanese faced, quote: \"imminent starvation.\" US Planners at the time, however, weren't nearly so bold, and the whole reason why advocates of tightening the noose around the Home Islands came up with so many different estimates of when blockade and bombardment might force Japan to surrender was because the situation wasn't nearly as cut and dried as it appears today, even when that nation's supply lines were severed. Japan would indeed have become, quote: \"a nation without cities,\" as urban populations suffered grievously under the weight of Allied bombing; but over half the population during the war lived and worked on farms. Back then the system of price supports that has encouraged Japanese farmers today to convert practically every square foot of their land to rice cultivation did not exist. Large vegetable gardens were a standard feature of a family's land and wheat was also widely grown. \n \n The idea that the Japanese were about to run out of food any time soon was largely derived from repeated misreadings of the Summary Report of the 104-volume US Strategic Bombing Survey of Japan. Using Survey findings, Craven and Cate, in the multi-volume US Army Air Force history of WWII detailed the successful US mine-laying efforts against Japanese shipping which essentially cut Japanese oil and food imports, and state only that by mid-August, quote: \"the calorie count of the average man's fare had shrunk dangerously.\" Obviously, some historians enthusiasm for the point they are trying to make has gotten the better of them since the reduced nutritional value of meals is somewhat different than \"imminent starvation.\"\n \n As for the Imperial Army itself, it was in somewhat better shape than is commonly understood today. Moreover, the Japanese had figured us out. They had correctly deduced the landing beaches and even the approximate times of both invasion operations, and were thus presented with huge tactical and even strategic possibilities. And although the Japanese had never perfected central control and massed fire of their artillery, this fact was largely irrelevant under such circumstances. The months that the Japanese Sixteenth Army had to wait for the first US invasion, at Kyushu, were not going to be spent with its soldiers and the island's massive civilian population sitting on their duffs. The ability to dig in and preregister, dig in and preregister, dig in and preregister, cannot be so casually dismissed. To borrow a phrase from a recent Asian war, the Kyushu invasion areas were going to be a, quote: \"target-rich environment\" where artillery was going to methodically do its work on a large number of soldiers and Marines whose luck had run out. On Okinawa, the US Tenth Army commander, General Buckner, was killed by artillery fire when the campaign was ostensibly in the mopping-up phase, and from World War I to the recent fighting in Grosny, where shells killed a Russian two-star general, there is ample evidence of artillery living up to its deadly reputation.\n \n It has also been stated that US ground troops didn't really need to worry about Japanese cave defenses since combat experience in the Pacific, and tests run in the US, proved the effectiveness of self-propelled 8-inch and 155mm howitzer against caves and bunkers as well as their vulnerability to direct fire from tanks. That the Japanese were also well aware of this and were arranging defensive positions accordingly from lessons learned on Okinawa and the Philippines is not mentioned. In any event, the Japanese had already demonstrated that they could, with the right terrain, construct strongpoints, like Item Pocket on Okinawa, which could not be bypassed and had to be reduced without benefit of any direct-fire weapons since no tanks- let alone lumbering self-propelled guns- could work their way in for an appropriate shot.\n \n Similarly, on the Japanese ability to defend against US tanks, Army and Marine armor veterans of the Pacific war would be amazed to learn that they had little to fear during the invasion. After all, Japan's obsolescent 47mm anti-tank guns, quote: \"could penetrate the M-4 Sherman's armor only in vulnerable spots at very close range\" and that their older 37mm gun was completely ineffective against the Sherman tank. In fact, the Japanese, through hard experience, were becoming quite adept at tank killing. During two actions in particular on Okinawa, they managed to knock out 22 and 30 Shermans respectively. In one of these fights, Fujio Takeda managed to stop four tanks with six 400-yard shots from his supposedly worthless 47mm. As for the 37mm, it was not intended to actually destroy tanks during the invasions but to immobilize them at very short ranges so that they would become easier prey for the infantry tank-killing teams that had proven so effective on Okinawa.\n \n Some historians are also somewhat more confident than on-scene commanders as to our ability to pulverize Japanese defenses. This may be due, in part, to an overly literal interpretation of what the Japanese meant by \"beach defenses,\" even though there is ample documentation on their efforts to develop positions well inland, out of range of the Navy's big guns. One author, from the safe distance of five decades wrote: \"That coastal defense units could have survived the greatest pre-invasion bombardment in history to fight a tenacious, organized beach defense was highly doubtful.\" I do believe something similar to this was confidently maintained just before the Somme in 1916, and it is worthwhile noting that every square inch of Iwo Jima and Okinawa was well within the range of the Navy's 8-, 12-, 14-, and 16-inch guns during those campaigns. [Murmurs and whistle.]\n Points like these may sound rather nit-picky but they assume great importance when you realize that, as noted earlier, the target date for Kyushu of 1 November 1945 was going to get pushed back as much as 45 days, giving the Japanese as much as four and a half months from the flashing red light of the 29 July intelligence estimate to prepare their defenses.\n \n The Joint Chiefs originally set the date for the invasion of Kyushu (Operation Olympic) as X-Day, December 1, 1945, and for Honshu (Operation Coronet) as Y-Day, March 1, 1946. To lessen casualties, the launch of Coronet would await the arrival of two armored divisions from Europe to sweep up Honshu's Kanto Plain and cut off Tokyo before the seasonal monsoons turned it into vast pools of rice, muck, and water crisscrossed by elevated roads and dominated by rugged, well-defended foothills.\n \n Now, long before the British experienced the tragedy of pushing XXX Corps up a single road through the Dutch lowlands to Arnhem, an event popularized through the book and movie A Bridge too Far, US planners were well aware of the costs that would be incurred if the Kanto Plain was not secured for mobile warfare and airfield construction prior to the wet season. Intensive hydrological and weather studies begun in 1943 made it clear that an invasion in early March offered the best chance of success, with the situation becoming more risky as the month progressed.\n \n With good luck, relatively free movement across the plain might even be possible well into April. Unfortunately, this assumed that the snow run-off from the mountains would not be too severe, and that the Japanese would not flood the fields. While subsequent post-war prisoner interrogations did not reveal any plans to systematically deluge low-lying areas, a quick thrust up the Kanto Plain would not have been as speedy as planners believed. First, there were no bridges in the area capable of taking vehicles over 12 tons. Every tank, every self-propelled gun, and prime mover would have to cross bridges erected for the event. Next, logistical considerations and the sequence of follow-up units would require that armored divisions not even land until Y+10. This would provide time for the defenders to observe that the US infantry's generic tank support was severely hampered by already flooded rice fields and- shall we say- suggest ways to make things worse for the invaders.\n \n A late start on Honshu would leave American forces to fight their way up flood plains that were only dry during certain times of the year, but could be suddenly inundated by the Japanese. If the timetable slipped for either operation, US soldiers and Marines on Honshu would risk fighting in terrain similar to that later encountered in Vietnam- minus the helicopters to fly over this mess- where all movement was readily visible from even low terrain features and vulnerable convoys moved on roads above rice paddies. Unfortunately, foul weather would have delayed base development on Kyushu and spelled a potentially disastrous late start for the operation on Honshu.\n \n Planners envisioned the construction of 11 airfields on Kyushu for the massed airpower which would soften up Honshu. Bomb and fuel storage, roads, wharves, and base facilities would be needed to support those air groups plus the US Sixth Army holding a 110-mile stop-line one third of the way up the island. All plans centered on construction of the minimum essential operating facilities. But that minimum grew. The 31- that's 31 - air groups was increased to 40 then to 51 - all for an island\n on which there was considerably less terrain information available than we erroneously believed we knew about Leyte. Numerous airfields would come on line early to support ground operations on Kyushu, but the lengthy strips and support facilities for Honshu-bound medium and heavy bombers would only start to become available 45 days into the operation. Most were not projected to be ready until 90 to 105 days after the initial landings on Kyushu in spite of a massive effort.\n \n The constraints on the air campaign were so clear that when the Joint Chiefs set the target dates of the Kyushu and the Honshu invasions for December 1, 1945 and March 1, 1946, respectively, it was apparent that the three-month period between X-Day, Olympic and Y-Day, Coronet, would not be sufficient. Weather ultimately determined which operation to reschedule\n because Coronet could not be moved back without moving it closer to the monsoon season and thus risking serious restrictions on the ground campaign from flooded fields, and the air campaign from cloud cover that almost doubles from early March to early April. This was a no-brainer. MacArthur proposed bumping the Kyushu invasion ahead by a month. As soon as this was pointed out, both Nimitz and the Joint Chiefs in Washington immediately agreed. Olympic was moved forward one month to November 1, which also gave the Japanese less time to dig in.\n \n Unfortunately these best-laid plans would not have unfolded as expected even if the atom bombs had not been dropped and the Soviet entry into the Pacific War had not frustrated Tokyo's last hope of reaching a settlement short of unconditional surrender- a Versailles-like outcome unacceptable to Truman and many of his contemporaries because it was seen as an incomplete victory that could well require the next generation to refight the war. An infinitely bigger war than the late unpleasantness in Vietnam, which would have seen us sending troops overseas in 1965 to fight Japan instead of to Southeast Asia. No deferments for that one. [Laughter.] The end result of this delay would have been an even more costly campaign on Honshu than was predicted. A blood bath in which pre-invasion casualty estimates rapidly became meaningless because of something that the defenders could not achieve on their own, but a low pressure trough sitting along the Asian littoral would: knock the delicate US timetable off balance.\n \n The Divine Wind, or Kamikaze, of a powerful typhoon destroyed a foreign invasion force heading for Japan in 1281, and it was for this storm that Japanese suicide aircraft of World War II were named. On October 9, 1945, a similar typhoon packing 140-mile per hour winds struck the American staging area on Okinawa that would have been expanded to capacity by that time if the war had not ended in September, and was still crammed with aircraft and assault shipping- much of which was destroyed. US analysts at the scene matter-of-factly reported that the storm would have caused up to a 45-day delay in the invasion of Kyushu. The point that goes begging, however, is that while these reports from the Pacific were correct in themselves, they did not make note of the critical significance that such a delay, well past the initial- and unacceptable- target date of December 1, would have on base construction on Kyushu, and consequently mean for the Honshu invasion, which would have then been pushed back as far as mid-April 1946.\n \n If there had been no atom bombs and Tokyo had attempted to hold out for an extended time- a possibility that even bombing and blockade advocates granted- the Japanese would have immediately appreciated the impact of the storm in the waters around Okinawa. Moreover, they would know exactly what it meant for the follow-up invasion of Honshu, which they had predicted as accurately as the invasion of Kyushu. Even with the storm delay and friction of combat on Kyushu, the Coronet schedule would have led US engineers to perform virtual miracles to make up for lost time and implement Y-Day as early in April as possible. Unfortunately the Divine Winds packed a one-two punch.\n \n On 4 April 1946, another typhoon raged in the Pacific, this one striking the northernmost Philippine island of Luzon on the following day where it inflicted only moderate damage before moving toward Taiwan. Coming almost a year after the war, it was of no particular concern. The Los Angeles Times gave it about a paragraph on the bottom of page 2. But if Japan had held out, this storm would have had profound effects on the world we live in today. It would have been the closest watched weather cell in history. Would the storm move to the west after hitting Luzon, the Army's main staging area for Coronet, or would it take the normal spiraling turn to the north, and then northeast as the October typhoon? Would slow, shallow-draft landing craft be caught at sea or in the Philippines where loading operations would be put on hold? If they were already on their way to Japan, would they be able to reach Kyushu's sheltered bay? And what about the breakwater caissons for the massive artificial harbor to be assembled near Tokyo? The construction of the harbor's pre-fabricated components carried a priority second only to the atom bomb, and this precious towed cargo could not be allowed to fall victim to the storm and be scattered across the sea. \n \n Whatever stage of employment US forces were in during those first days of April, a delay of some sort- certainly no less than a week and perhaps much, much more- was going to occur. A delay that the two US field armies invading Honshu, the First and Eighth, could ill afford and that Japanese militarists would see as yet another sign that they were right after all. This is critical. Various authors have noted that much of the land today contains built-up areas not there in 1946, but are blissfully unaware that, thanks to the delays, anyone treading this same, quote: \"flat, dry tank country\" in 1946 would, in reality, have been up to their calves in muck and rice shoots by the time the invasion actually took place.\n \n Recent years have also seen the claim that the kamikaze threat was overrated. Time does not allow the subject to be discussed in any sort of detail here, but one aspect is worth emphasizing: US intelligence turned out to be dead wrong about the number of Japanese planes available to defend the Home Islands. Estimates that 6,700 could be made available in stages, grew to only 7,200 by the time of the surrender. This number, however, turned out to be short by some 3,300 in light of the armada of 10,500 planes which the enemy planned to expend in stages during the opening phases of the invasion operations- most as Kamikazes. All guesswork aside, occupation authorities after the war found that the number of military aircraft actually available in the Home Islands was over 12,700. Another thing about those 3,300 undetected aircraft, it is worthwhile remembering that, excluding aircraft that returned to base, the Japanese actually expended well under half that number as Kamikazes at Okinawa, roughly 1,400, where over 5,000 US sailors were killed. \n \n Of course, to some, all this discussion about the surprise 3,300 kamikaze aircraft, the delay of the Honshu landing until the rice paddies were flooded, etc., is all moot because the Japanese were supposedly just itching to surrender even before the dropping of the atom bombs and the Soviet Union's entry into the war. Well, we'll just have to save that one for another time.

While not every citizen was carrying a katana and just waiting for the gajin to come close enough, the will to resist was strong in the military higher ranks, and the Japanese are noted as oboedient to authority.

Yes, there were emotional appeals to certain cultural elements, propaganda so Japanese soldiers might feel nationalistic pride in their martial occupation, but to say they lived by the 'code of the bushido' is like saying American soldiers lived by the code of the 'wild west quickdraw'.\n\n \n Your ignorance of history is showing, so let me edumakate you. ;) \n \n \n\n In early 1945 Japan had about three million troops overseas, about a third of them dug in on islands throughout the Pacific. These men were thoroughly indoctrinated in the Bushido code, which held that it was better to die than to surrender--and by God, that's what they did. Of 23,000 Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima, for example, 21,000 were killed and just 200 captured. Only after Emperor Hirohito ordered his forces to surrender following the dropping of the atom bomb did Japanese troops give themselves up in massive numbers.\n http://www.straightdope.com/columns/000310.html\n \n\n \n \n\n What is the Code of Bushido and what happened with it in World War 2?\n \n \n \n Answer\n \n The code of Bushido is a way of life the samurai of ancient Japanese followed. I do not know bushido's relevance to WWII.\n \n Answer\n \n Bushido was a code which the Japanese were taught to live by. They were taught that dedication and complete respect to their emperor and family was important. If the Japanese in anyway disgraced themselves they would commit suicide so they could save the reputation of there family. In WW2 the Japanese could not understand why many of the Allied forces surrendered and therefore treated them poorly.\n \n Answer\n \n The Code of Bushido in WWII was used as a tool to motivate the ignorant masses to murder and die in the name of the emperor. For example, the rape, torture and murder of over 300,000 \"unarmed\" civilians in Nanking was justified by the arrogance and racism of the Code. The estimated 10 million Chinese (mostly civilians)killed starved and murdered with biological weapons by the Japanese was not at all \"honorable\".The military in control of the government and the puppet \"divine\" emperor used the Code to brainwash and control the ordinary soldier. Some of the Code's character traits such as Justice, Unselfishness, Righteousness, Honor and Virtue were a joke in WWII. Using the \"divine wind\" or kamikaze to die in large numbers for naught was renamed \"passing wind\" by U.S. pilots.Blind obedience in the name of Country-- what a waste.The Japanese people deserved better.\n \n Answer\n \n The code of Bushido is a code of honor that can be closely compared to the medieval Europe code of chivalry. It required many things that could be expected like courtesy towards women, strong spirituality and the most important was having no fear of death. Since the bushi were Buddhists they believed that if they died they would be reincarnated as another form. This encouraged them to commit suicide or \"seppuku\" which was done by a defeated samurai kneeling down and sticking a sword or knife through his chest in order to feel the pain of defeat, a comrade or enemy would then chop of his head to symbolize the end of suffering. During WWII this sacred code was considered important to follow, particularly in causes of surrender. As the samurai traditionally carries two swords -one long sword for fighting and a short stabbing knife in the event of defeat and the Japanese soldier needed to commit suicide- he would surrender his fighting sword if he was captured. This sword is seen as their most prized possession and giving this sword to any other person would be a disgrace to the man's family and Emperor.\n \n In WW2, when the Japanese were held prisoner in Cowra prison Australia, many Japanese prisoners could not understand the quality of the treatment which the Australian guards gave them. They received a good standard of housing and were well fed. Although treated so well, the Japanese were not happy and often attempted suicide. Many also changed there names so that their parents assumed they were dead rather then disappoint them. This was because of the way they were taught to follow the Bushido code. \n http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_Code_of_Bushido_and_what_happened_with_it_in_World_War_2\n \n\n \n And below is an excerpt from an article discussing why the Allies used the phrase \"I cease resistance\" in order to overcome the Code of Bushido. \n \n\n According to numerous sources, the Japanese did not have a word for \"surrender\" in their vocabulary. Worse, under their rules of Bushido, if they did surrender they were disgraced and lost from their family and ancestors forever. Regardless, the United States did produce early leaflets that said \"I Surrender.\" The Japanese apparently did have several words for \"surrender,\" including \"kosan\" and \"kofuku.\" Whatever the word, the leaflet failed miserably. Japanese surrenders were rare. There is an interesting theory that the \"I surrender\" term was more for the American soldiers than for the Japanese. Because of early Japanese treachery when pretending to surrender, the G.I.s and Marines tended to shoot the Japanese when they came out of their caves and bunkers. There is reason to believe that Sixth Army H.Q. wanted the \"I surrender\" text in large type so that the American soldiers would see the words and hold their fire. The words, so hateful to the Japanese, might save their lives.\n http://www.psywarrior.com/ICeaseJap.html\n \n\n \n For a comic book belief, the Allied forces sure went through a lot of effort to circumvent it. emoticon_rolleyes",

Horrific indeed, I would not dispute that. Racist...not likely. Seems to be little difference in how we valued German life and Japanese life. Considering our willingness to carpet bomb and firebomb German cities and char broil hundreds of thousands of civilians, I have a hard time buying the argument that the use of the A-Bomb was racist.

   "For at least the final year of the war, and perhaps even since Midway, the Japanese were asking to discuss terms of surrender. The US refused to respond to these requests.\n\n Really? The Japanese sure had a funny way of showing that they desired to surrender following Midway. Let's see...:\n Midway: June 1942\n Japanese offensive continues in New Guinea: July 1942\n Japan attacks in the Solomons killing 1000+ allied soldiers: August 1942\n Japanese attack US at Guadalcanal: August 1942\n USS Wasp sunk by Japanese Sub: September 1942\n Battle of Santa Cruz: October 1942\n New Georgia: July 1943\n Bougainville: July 1943\n Japanese Offensive at Leyte Gulf: October 1944\n Iwo Jima: February 1945\n Okinawa: April 1945\n ...Among many others.\n \n \nComplaining they weren't \"formal offers\" or vaguely that the terms weren't \"satisfactory to the allies\" is the lamest reason for mass murder I've ever heard. \n \n What was it that was so horrible about the terms that it justifies nuking a couple of cities?\n \n You know all this, apparently, and yet you claim that what motivated US policy was to \"shorten the war as quicly as possible and not to waste any more allied lives unecessarily\", and yet it pursued a policy guaranteed to drag the war out as long as possible and to waste as many allied and Japanese lives as possible, by refusing to even discuss terms of surrender.\n\n \n \n(b) Proclamation Defining Terms for Japanese Surrender, July 26, 1945\n \n (1) We-The President of the United States, the President of the National Government of the Republic of China, and the Prime Minister of Great Britain, representing the hundreds of millions of our countrymen, have conferred and agree that Japan shall be given an opportunity to end this war.\n \n (2) The prodigious land, sea and air forces of the United States, the British Empire and of China, many times reinforced by their armies and air fleets from the west, are poised to strike the final blows upon Japan. This military power is sustained and inspired by the determination of all the Allied Nations to prosecute the war against Japan until she ceases to resist.\n \n (3) The result of the futile and senseless German resistance to the might of the aroused free peoples of the world stands forth in awful clarity as an example to the people of Japan. The might that now converges on Japan is immeasurably greater than that which, when applied to the resisting Nazis, necessarily laid waste to the lands, the industry and the method of life of the whole German people. The full application of our military power, backed by our resolve, All mean the inevitable and complete destruction of the Japanese armed forces and just as inevitably the utter devastation of the Japanese homeland.\n \n (4) The time has come for Japan to decide whether she will continue to be controlled by those self-willed militaristic advisers whose unintelligent calculations have brought the Empire of Japan to the threshold of annihilation, or whether she will follow the path of reason.\n \n (5) Following are our terms. We will not deviate from them. There are no alternatives. We shall brook no delay.\n \n (6) There must be eliminated for all time the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest, for we insist that a new order of peace security and justice will be impossible until irresponsible militarism is driven from the world.\n \n (7) Until such a new order is established and until there is convincing proof that Japan's war-making power is destroyed, points in Japanese territory to be designated by the Allies shall be occupied to secure the achievement of the basic objectives we are here setting forth.\n \n (8) The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out and Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine.\n \n (9) The Japanese military forces, after being completely disarmed, shall be permitted to return to their homes with the opportunity to lead peaceful and productive lives.\n \n (10) We do not intend that the Japanese shall be enslaved as a race or destroyed as a nation, but stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners. The Japanese Government shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. Freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be established.\n \n (11) Japan shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those [industries] which would enable her to re-arm for war. To this end, access to, as distinguished from control of, raw materials shall be permitted. Eventual Japanese participation in world trade relations shall be permitted.\n \n (12) The occupying forces of the Allies shall be withdrawn from Japan as soon as these objectives have been accomplished and there has been established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people a peacefully inclined and responsible government.\n \n (13) We call upon the government of Japan to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of all Japanese armed forces, and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action. The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction.\n\n \n The Potsdam Ultimatum\n \n This ultimatum was ignored by Japan. It could not have been spelled out any more clearly. Japan was given the opportunity to surrender by the allied forces, yet they refused to aknowledge it.",

However, I think other things came into play, too, not the least of which was where this act would propel us on the world stage after the war. Our leadership would have been grotesquely remiss not to consider those consequences.

These were not the sorts amenable to the kind of acts or dialogue that inspire love or trust, or what I would consider real respect (as opposed to fear).

And that was all we could have done, as far as I can see.\n\n \n I'm having a hard time disagreeing with anything you said here. I would only add that although we had to consider the consequences of of our actions, I really don't believe we were concerned with how using the bombs effected our standing in the World as much as it effected how the World perceived us after using such a powerful weapon that only we possessed. I believe our standing as a political giant was already assured based on that Japanese Generals statement after attacking Pearl Harbor that he feared they have awoken a sleeping Giant. So we were already seen as a formidable enemy prior to WW2.\n \n Also remember that we warned the Japanese Government and gave them a number of days to surrender or else we would drop the first bomb which we described to them. The fact that they didn't surrender shows a lack of concern for their own citizens in the face of such devastation. The same warning was given before the second bomb was dropped, and again their heart was hardened against the proper concern and welfare for their citizens. All they had to do to avoid being bombed at all was surrender which they did after the second one was dropped, affectively ending the Second World War.\n \n That decision on their part not to surrender before we dropped the first bomb makes them more culpable for the suffering they endured than we are because we were after all in a War with them that they started, and it was their responsibility to protect Japans citizens in a time of War, not our responsibility to protect their citizens. It was a War after all, and Wars used to be fought by us to win, unlike today.",

In many cases, the families of the internees were allowed to remain together at internment camps throughout the U.S. In others, families and even children were forced to fend for themselves. Limited due process was allowed for those arrested and detained.\n \n Legislation was introduuced in the United States Congress in 2001 to create an independent commission to review government policies on European \"enemy\" ethnic groups during the war.[1] An organization, the German American Internee Coalition, exists to publicize the \"internment, repatriation and exchange of civilians of German ethnicity\" during the war, and to seek U.S. government review and acknowledgement of civil rights violations involved\n \n\n \n Thought I would point that out since you seem to find Wiki such a great source.

God showed us throughout the bible how He commanded leaders to protect their citizens from foreign invaders through the act of WAR. I mean, show me any historically accepted school of thought which teaches one nation to surrender to another violent and brutal nation which invades her, without any resistance at all? \n \n \nGod came in the person of Jesus Christ, and he told us how to live. He said \"render to no one evil for evil\". He said \"do not resist an evil person, if someone strikes you on the right cheek, offer the left as well\".

Then why do you apply His words to Nation States as if He commanded one country to turn the other cheek rather than protect its millions of citizens from foreign invaders?\n \n \n That is the route that the early church took when faced with persecution. They didn't take up arms against the Roman state. They told people the Good News, and in spite of the persecution the church grew faster than at any time since. \n\n \n True, but again, the church was made up of individuals who submitted themselves to Gods protection and authority over their lives.

Because you are either blatantly lying or once again proving that your warped interpretation is based on your personal spiritual blind spots. Jesus told his own disciples to arm themselves even if they had to sell their coat in order to purchase a sword for self defense.\n Luk 22:36 And He said to them, \"But now, whoever has a money belt is to take it along, likewise also a bag, and whoever has no sword is to sell his coat and buy one.\n He also warned that those who live by the sword would die by it. But that wasn't a statement of pacifism at all. It was a warning that those who live by violence will die violent deaths. This is a true warning which christians follow and live by. But now show how it applies to world leaders who are responsible for protecting millions of citizens they have been elected/empowered to protect? Of course you can't show that. And show how defending against foreign invasion is even seen as violence by God rather than an act of self defense? Can you show that Jo? Of course you can't.\n \n But that doesn't stop you from applying the personal gospel message to individuals, to world leaders who are responsible for protecting complete nations of citizens.",

The pacifist position is admirable (\"what if they gave a war and no one came\"?), but I think, if attacked, one has a right to strike back with equal or greater force, and that it can be strategically logical within certain parameters to do so. Illogical not to do so. I also think it is arguable, that during a war like the Second World War, if one takes a pacifist position, that in itself is morally questionable because a position on one side of the fence or the other, at such a juncture, is an inescapable reality. How can you also tell others that they cannot or should not defend themselves or try to win? You might make such a personal choice for you, individually, but how so for others and what they are fighting for? And there is a powerful argument ITO of defending a vulnerable other. If able, you may be morally obligated to do so.\n \n That being said and done, there's a certain amount of insanity that arises in war -- some of which may serve a logically strategic purpose, and some of which we just wish it so. \n \n It would be very good to get past war.

   "I don't pretend to know everything about war, in fact I probably know very little about the feelings of those that fought or participated in that war. The things I do know and probably most of us know, that WWII was total war. It was not a war like those of recent memories, it was a war that it was either do or die. Some people claim the dropping of the A-bomb on Nagasaki and Hiroshima were just excuses by our government to test our their \"new toy.\" Others claim it was necessary to save American and Japanese lives. I believe it was neither. I believe it was the declaration of new empires \"power.\" At was at that time that the US claimed it's superior military might over the world. The reason I say this is because governments and regimes exist only to maintain their legitimacy over their countries and to some extent over the world. Had the USSR never acquired the A-bomb as well, you can bet the US would be pretty much the only country running everything. It would the will of US is the will of world. Whether you believe this to be good or not well that can be left opened for discussion, but I for one do not believe the Dropping of the A-bomb was primarily done to save lives, let alone Japanese lives. In total war you do not care if you have to kill the entire nation, if they oppose you regardless of who they are you kill them any way you can. The Japanese commitment to their leader and military made the matter a heck of a lot worse.

But that's what occurs in war. It's an oxymoron to call something a civilized war, for war, by its very nature is anything BUT civilized. It is the culmination of man's inability to rationally deal with other human beings at a particular point in time. \n \n \nal Qaeda has declared war on the U.S.\n The U.S. has graciously accepted, and declared war on them as well.\n \n If al Qaeda were to detonate a nuclear bomb in a U.S. city akin to Nagasaki / Hiroshima (heck, make it two cities), would the U.S. label it as an act of war?\n To be analogous, the bomb would have to kill about 220,000 people.\n (for comparison sake, that's about 73 times the number of people killed on 9/11)\n \n Or would we call it terrorism?\n emoticon_frazzled\n\n \n Al Qaeda isn't a state, so any actions taken by it are necessarily terrorist in nature. \n \n \nThat's highly debatable, the second was 3 days after the first, which is hardly enough time for effectively a revolution to take place.\n\n \n Japan was still moving troops towards the potential invasion site AFTER the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. That's proof enough that Japan hadn't lost its Code of Bushida yet. \n \n \nThe key lesson if it all is: the war got started and then got steadily worse. No side was clean - no side at all. As casualties and suffering mount, so does hatred, and soon the enemy is just the enemy and not a human any more. And it's OK to do the unthinkable to non-people. The bombing of Dresden, the bombing of Hiroshima, the rape of Nanjing... all were coming.\n \n They are not anomalies - they are part of what war really is. \n \n Some participants were more extreme, some less, but then, some could afford to be cleaner than others. My local winners went particularly extreme after the war, but that's beside the point.\n \n The key point is that there is no such thing as a nice, clean war.\n \n Which should be in front of everyone's eyes when they are on the speaker's podium, screaming for one. Or just yelling \"Yeah, right!\" in the crowd.\n \n \n P.S. Jo, you are one of the very few christians on this board who actually realizes the point of christianity is \"turn the other cheek\". I wish Archie would finally get it, too.\n\n \n Explain Michael, the Arcangel, for me. Or for that matter Jericho, Sodom......emoticon_confused",

As I'm sure you were aware, there were factions within the japanese government with differing beliefs, so I don't count with any certainty a forecast of what they would have done.\n\n \n \n\n Prior to the atomic attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, elements existed within the Japanese government that were trying to find a way to end the war. In June and July 1945, Japan attempted to enlist the help of the Soviet Union to serve as an intermediary in negotiations. No direct communication occurred with the United States about peace talks, but American leaders knew of these maneuvers because the United States for a long time had been intercepting and decoding many internal Japanese diplomatic communications. From these intercepts, the United States learned that some within the Japanese government advocated outright surrender. A few diplomats overseas cabled home to urge just that. \n \n From the replies these diplomats received from Tokyo, the United States learned that anything Japan might agree to would not be a surrender so much as a \"negotiated peace\" involving numerous conditions. These conditions probably would require, at a minimum, that the Japanese home islands remain unoccupied by foreign forces and even allow Japan to retain some of its wartime conquests in East Asia. Many within the Japanese government were extremely reluctant to discuss any concessions, which would mean that a \"negotiated peace\" to them would only amount to little more than a truce where the Allies agreed to stop attacking Japan. After twelve years of Japanese military aggression against China and over three and one-half years of war with the United States (begun with the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor), American leaders were reluctant to accept anything less than a complete Japanese surrender. \n \n ......\n \n Following the bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 (right), the Japanese government met to consider what to do next. The emperor had been urging since June that Japan find some way to end the war, but the Japanese Minister of War and the heads of both the Army and the Navy held to their position that Japan should wait and see if arbitration via the Soviet Union might still produce something less than a surrender. Military leaders also hoped that if they could hold out until the ground invasion of Japan began, they would be able to inflict so many casualties on the Allies that Japan still might win some sort of negotiated settlement. Next came the virtually simultaneous arrival of news of the Soviet declaration of war on Japan of August 8, 1945, and the atomic bombing of Nagasaki of the following day. Another Imperial Council was held the night of August 9-10, and this time the vote on surrender was a tie, 3-to-3. For the first time in a generation, the emperor (right) stepped forward from his normally ceremonial-only role and personally broke the tie, ordering Japan to surrender. On August 10, 1945, Japan offered to surrender to the Allies, the only condition being that the emperor be allowed to remain the nominal head of state. \n \n Planning for the use of additional nuclear weapons continued even as these deliberations were ongoing. On August 10, Leslie Groves reported to the War Department that the next bomb, another plutonium weapon, would be \"ready for delivery on the first suitable weather after 17 or 18 August.\" Following the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, only two targets remained from the original list: Kokura Arsenal and the city of Niigata. Groves therefore requested that additional targets be added to the target list. His deputy, General Kenneth Nichols, suggested Tokyo. Truman, however, ordered an immediate halt to atomic attacks while surrender negotiations were ongoing. As the Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace recorded in his diary, Truman remarked that he did not like the idea of killing \"all those kids.\" \n \n On August 12, the United States announced that it would accept the Japanese surrender, making clear in its statement that the emperor could remain in a purely ceremonial capacity only. Debate raged within the Japanese government over whether to accept the American terms or fight on. Meanwhile, American leaders were growing impatient, and on August 13 conventional air raids resumed on Japan. Thousands more Japanese civilians died while their leaders delayed. The Japanese people learned of the surrender negotiations for the first time when, on August 14, B-29s showered Tokyo with thousands of leaflets containing translated copies of the American reply of August 12. Later that day, the emperor called another meeting of his cabinet and instructed them to accept the Allied terms immediately, explaining \"I cannot endure the thought of letting my people suffer any longer\"; if the war did not end \"the whole nation would be reduced to ashes.\" \n \n The only question remaining now was if Japan's military leaders would allow the emperor to surrender. Loyalty to the emperor was an absolute in the Japanese military, but so was the refusal to surrender, and now that the two had come into conflict, open rebellion was a possible result. The emperor recorded a message in which he personally accepted the Allied surrender terms, to be broadcast over Japanese radio the following day. This way everyone in Japan would know that surrender was the emperor's personal will. Some within the Japanese military actually attempted to steal this recording before it could be broadcast, while others attempted a more general military coup in order to seize power and continue the war. Other elements of the Japanese military remained loyal to the emperor. The Minister of War, General Anami Korechika, personally supported continuing the war, but he also could not bring himself to openly rebel against his emperor. The strength of his dilemma was such that he opted for suicide as the only honorable way out. In the end, his refusal to assist the coup plotters was instrumental in their defeat by elements within the military that remained loyal to the emperor. \n \n On August 15, 1945, the emperor's broadcast announcing Japan's surrender was heard via radio all over Japan. For most of his subjects, it was the first time that they had ever heard his voice. The emperor explained that \"the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage,\" and that \"the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb.\" Over the next few weeks, Japan and the United States worked out the details of the surrender, and on September 2, 1945, the formal surrender ceremony took place on the deck of the U.S.S. Missouri.\n \n Japan Surrenders, August 10-15, 1945 \n\n \n \n\n In other words, it was necessary to drop the bombs to force the Japanese to surrender quickly to the Allies, rather than waiting for the soviets.\n \n\n \n I'm sure that the Allies feared that Stalin would allow Japan to keep part of conquered China, while it took a portion for itself. This would be unacceptable to the Allies who were Allies of China as well.\n \n \n But in any case, the practicality of it is a secondary issue for me. I don't see any moral distinction between the american government nuking hiroshima and nagasaki and a terrorist nuking los angeles and chicago to bring about a speedy withdrawal from afghanistan.\n\n \n Are you insane?!!! The atomic bombs were dropped by nations during a war started by the party bombed by a sneak attack. \n The terrorists aren't recognized by Afghanistan or Iraq as their nation's army, so there's no way any action they take can be legitimized. I can't believe that anybody would be so naive as to even make such an absurd comment. emoticon_wow",
