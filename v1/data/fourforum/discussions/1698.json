   "Many moons ago, I worked in CP. That's Community Protection in beautiful Washington State. This is a program that allows level II and III sex offenders to live in the community with 24hour supervision by staff.\n \n I worked with some bad mother ****ers in this program, one in particular who re-offended while in the program. His punishment? He was remanded to CP for another 9 years. \n \n Some of the people in this program were genuinely good people (most were developmentally disabled and did not have comprehension of their crimes, which is why they were supervised to prevent them from re-committing), but others just had no appreciation for the opportunity they were being given in the community. They assaulted staff people, acted out in the community - all with no consequences, other than being remanded to abuse more staff.\n \n Do you guys in other states have these types of programs that you're aware of. A lot of people in my community don't even know that this program exisits, and I'm interested to learn about the long-term effects of having these programs.\n \n Jo",
