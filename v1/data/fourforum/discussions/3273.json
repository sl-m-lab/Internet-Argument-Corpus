   "This thread will probably attract some flak (for my presumption) because \n I'm not an American; but here goes anyway.\n Among the justifications for the American interventions in Afghanistan and\n Iraq are the claims that the inhabitants of these technically backward and\n politically corrupt countries deserved to be liberated from the evil regimes\n that oppressed them. America would help these peoples build a state based\n on democratic institutions, the rule of law, etc. Sooner rather than later,\n Iraq and Afghanistan would then join the modern world of tolerance, peace\n and justice.\n I see no sense whatever in the expenditure of American blood and treasure \n in pursuit of these idealistic objectives. Americans who know their history\n are aware that their freedoms had to be fought for: they were not achieved\n with the help of any foreign benevolent super-power. Self-government must\n come from within; it can't be imposed from without on a politically immature\n society.\n So in the present situation (as I see it) I suggest that American political and\n military effort should be restricted to just three priorities:\n 1. Security of the American homeland.\n 2. Defence of American citizens and interests abroad.\n 3. Effective retaliation against attacks that compromise 1 and 2.\n \n What I've called the American self-imposed World Task is to be more than a\n mere beacon of hope and liberty, it's also to be an active dispenser of peace\n and justice over the entire planet - and this is too much, way too much.\n \n This is a grossly oversimplified picture of certain matters of current concern.\n I'm aware of this of course, but, hey, I'm not writing a chapter for a text book \n here, I'm just making a few debatable points that not many people will read\n and a few will completely repudiate.",

They are all on and connected to other committees and projects devoted to similar causes, like AEI (much broader scope) and AIPAC, American Israeli Political Action Committee; Washington Institute for Near East Policy (Winep), on and on. Think tanks and lobby groups out the butt. \n \n PNAC just seems to sum up everything into a nice package and has signatories (members, if you will) that are very high up in the current administration. The message is very straightforward. America has no real military rivals and so we should use our unrivaled military strength to enforce our global superiority.

They think that this means we must be pro-active in \"securing\" American interests across the globe by taking advantage of the situation. It seems like they look at balance sheets, maps, and figures and from that they form plans for \"action.\" Invariably \"action\" means war, and people are killed, stuff blown up, all for the economic interests of a relativiely small number of corporations (I mean America).\n \n Anyway, there are a lot of people out there that support the idea of some sort of American empire, or at the very least \"global leadership,\" whatever that means.

   "The problem with replacing oil.\n \n There has to be some form of energy production that doesn't take more energy to provide it. Oil does this now.

It's very hard to find now. We simply grow hay for our horses. Come on, the technologies just don't exist.\" A few \"breakthroughs\" happened didn't they? FILLING STATIONS !!! Could those people have imagined them? Of course not. Just like we can't imagine the breakthroughs that will happen when oil gets more scarce. When computers were first being built in the 1940's, do you think ANYONE back then could have dreamed what we are now doing with them?\n \n I'm not saying that oil's replacement is going to be a beautiful, smooth transition. When Henry Ford started mass producing cars, there weren't too many filling stations. Filling stations came about from a free market, just like oil's replacement and all that goes with it will come from a free market.

With the report in hand, President Carter said, \"We could use up all proven reserves in the entire world by the next decade.\" \n \n I won't be looking at current estimated reserves, thank you. I'll be looking at today's prices, today's peoples' ability to pay them, and the governments safety and environmental regulations interference with those who have the ability to come up with something new.",

The question is, is the 2004 government capable of staying out of the way like it did in 1904?\n\n \n \n Hay for the horses provided more energy than it took to produce.\n \n The sun fed the grass, the grass fed the horses, the horses did our work for us. Net energy for us.\n \n Before the discovery of petroleum, they weren't scrambling to find a technology that would somehow replace horses because there wasn't something else to extract the energy from. Hay was it. \n \n Then petro was discovered. It gives us even more energy than hay than it takes to produce. Oil wasn't the technology. It was the source of energy. Like you say, it didn't take long for the technology that extract's the oil's energy to come around. Afterall, you just get it hot and away it goes. Net energy for us.\n \n Now, when oil becomes scarce, what are we going to replace it with?\n \n What will be the source of energy? Ultimately, it will have to be the sun (or maybe the core of the earth, or maybe the fusion of atoms.) Afterall that's where the energy in the hay and in the oil came from (the sun). But, at this moment we do not have the technology to produce a device that will use the sun (or some other renewable energy source) and provide more energy than it took to make it.\n \n If we had a renewable source of energy whose conversion device didn't take more energy to produce than the source provided, we'd be using it now.\n \n I don't think I'm making myself clear. \n \n \n .",

There are going to be problems when we have to make a transition from oil to something else. But I think scarcity and high prices will make it happen in ways we just can't see untill we get there. But there is one BIG problem that is going to cause more trouble than anything else, IMO. It's a thing called big government and taxes. Oil is TAXED, and it's been increasing gradually over the decades just slowly enough to keep the public from noticing. Something like 1/8, or 1/7, of the price of every single gallon of gasoline and diesel fuel we buy is federal tax. I don't know what the best way would be to measure it - millions of dollars a day, an hour, a minute, or a second. My wild guess would be millions per minute, 24/7/365. Any new energy source that can efficiently start replacing oil is going to have to be heavily taxed quickly in ways that the voting public will see, in order to keep our massive government fed. Maybe I AM being too optimistic. Our government may be a little too big for us to free market our way out of oil dependence. We didn't have a 15% tax on hay in 1904, did we? :(",
