   "The abortion debate has mainly been framed in an \"all or nothing\" way. Namely, people seem to focus on banning abortions in all three trimesters of a pregnancy or on allowing abortions in all three trimesters. The great majority of Americans hold views that are in between, as is shown in the following survey question:\n \n \"Thinking more generally: Do you think abortion should generally be legal or generally illegal during each of the following stages of pregnancy? How about [see below]?\"\n \n \"In the first three months of pregnancy\" \n 66% Legal\n 29% Illegal\n 3% Depends\n 2% Unsure \n \n \"In the second three months of pregnancy\"\n 25% Legal\n 68% Illegal\n 4% Depends\n 3% Unsure\n \n \"In the last three months of pregnancy\"\n 10% Legal\n 84% Illegal\n 4% Depends\n 2% Unsure\n \n (from a CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll taken Jan. 10-12, 2003. N=1,002 adults nationwide. Margin of Error \u00b1 3%, which I found on the web site http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm)\n \n This shows that a significant majority of people in the US would allow abortion in the first trimester (where, incidentally, 88% of the abortions take place) and outlaw it in the second and third trimester. \n \n So, how would you answer that survey question and what reasons would you give for each of the trimesters?\n \n To those who are pro-life, what is it in the day-old embryo that makes it so worthy in your minds that its rights should outweight those of the mother?\n \n To those who are pro-choice, what is it in the fetus one day from birth that makes it differ enough from a born baby that the rights of the mother should take precedence?\n \n My own view is that abortion should be outlawed only in the third trimester since that is the time when the \"mind\" starts to form. For me, it is the possession of a mind, no matter how basic, that determines \"personhood\" and outweighs the mothers choice over her own body.",

   "I believe that at the point when the sperm merges with the egg the creation of life occurs. The male and female pronuclei move toward each other. \n \n Their nuclear envelopes disintegrate. A spindle is formed (following replication of the sperm's centriole), and a full diploid set of chromosomes assembles on it. The fertilized egg or zygote is now ready for its first mitosis.\n At this point the first cell of the new life is complete and ready to begin its own reproductive and development cycles. All information required for the formation and development of the new life is contained in the nucleus of this first cell. \n \n I do not hold a view however that the rights of the new life outweigh those of the mother. Both have an equal right to experience the wonder of life.\n \n The right to terminate either of these lives is questionable however I do have great sympathy for those women who experience pregnancy as a result of a crime rather than their own willing participation. \n \n I observe the way nature deals with other species and am able to accept that there are situations where death naturally occurs before birth but could not myself initiate an abortion.",

   "These are very good questions. Thank you for posting them.\n \n I believe that a woman should be able to legally, safely, and under good medical care be allowed to termimate her pregnancy at whatever piont she choses and for whatever reason by what ever method (That means labor induction or C-section too for third term etc..) her and her care provider feel is best for her.\n \n Now, that said, I also believe you would find it very very hard to find a Dr. or a women in her third trimester willing or interested in doing abortion. Most women who find out they are pregnant at this stage of thier pregnancy will opt to keep it or adopt out. Most who still seek abortion at this stage never end up getting one because of a lack of qualified willing physicians and/or cost and/or state law as it is in many states today. (This is a big problem. See the last paragraph of this post.) Others who wish not to be pregnant at this stage who have known they were pregnant usally choose to end the pregnancy becuase they are told it is best for their health due to unique health concerns for them i.e. PIH (Pregnancy Induced Hypertention or high blood pressure). Very few women suddenly \"change thier mind this late in the game\". Labor induction or cesarean section are the most common methods of ending pregnancy after 24 weeks gestation. The most common opinon of when the third trimester starts is at 28 weeks. Almost all abortions done after 24 weeks are done as \"Medical Nessesity\". Meaning for the mothers health.\n \n The maternal death rate assscociated with normal vaginal childbirth by induction or otherwise has roughly stayed at around 7 in 100,000 births in this country for many years. The death rate for women who abort is roughly 1 in 100,000. Since most abortions are preformed in the first or second trimester it is hard to know what would be safer for a women in her third trimester to choose (asuming she has a choice) if she wished to not be pregnant. But it is reasonable to think it would be just as safe if not safer than vaginal childbirth. Some women may veiw abortion as a more pleasant (fearing the discomfort of labor) option with a shorter recovery time than birth. Especialy if they not interested in adoption and assuming they are not interested in parenting. Many women who have been raped see going through the agony of birth as being similar to the rape experience and do not want to re-live it. (C-section death rates and recovery time lengths are much much higher/longer so I veiw this as non debatable in this discussion.) If you are to go \"by the book\" from Roe v.Wade and argue this is an issue of women's health and choice and not concider a fetus as having rights then one must leave legal the option of third term abortion as it may be the safest way for a woman to end a pregnancy.\n \n I feel that that is the way the law should be and remain. Now again will many women choose this option? No I don't think so. As a midwife, abortionist and mother, if a healthy women came to me this far in her pregnancy and siad \"I do not want this pregnancy what can I do to solve this problem?\" I would give her all the information I had on multiple options, but if she were to ask me what I personaly felt (I would probably not actully tell a patient my personal views unless it really seemed useful to her) I would tell her if it were me I would choose induction of labor and adoption. And I honestly feel that most women would too. \n \n Many if not most or all women who want an abortion this late in pregnancy becuase of personal reasons who would otherwise have a good chance at having a normal healthy birth are often living in extream chaos, poverty, participate in unsafe illegal activities and also abusive relationships. They are also often young, and commonly victims of rape or incest. They are not the kind of people to call an adpotion agancy on there own or even a Dr. in many cases. These are the women who leave fetuses in toilets and dumpsters. I would rather see a world where some religous groups and other indivduals are made uncomfortable by others choices (Let's face it , they already are anyway. Gay Marriage anyone?) than a world where a 10 year old climbs a dumpster looking for cool free finds only to get a horible lesson in the reality of the way the world treats \"the least of it's children\". (I am referring to both the woman and the fetus here.)",

I think that the great majority of people, including myself, would allow for medical necessity as an exception in the third trimester. However, I can't help but take some issue with the women who are chosing abortions in the third trimester due to personal reasons. By the third trimester, they had about six months to already make up their minds and find the help to get an abortion if they so choose. What is the big obstacle that prevents them from having had an abortion by then? If you have some relevant links discussing that issue, I would be quite interested in having a look.",

Some that come to mind include the killing of animals for food or to limit their overpopulation, the killing of an enemy in times of war, and killing for self-protection if, for example, a burgler is about to attack your family. There are also situations in which killing is actually good - such as killing viruses in your body or killing off a rat infestation to prevent the spread of disease.\n \n In all of these situations there are two things that we keep in mind in determining the morality - what exactly are we killing, and what is the situation that required the killing. Abortion brings to light both these issues. There is a balance of two difficult problems: 1) the embryo/fetus will most likely grow into a human being and, at late stages of the pregnancy, already has a mind that can feel pain and rudimentary emotions - its rights should be taken into account, 2) all human beings should have the most basic right to control over their own bodies, anything else is tyranny. As the embryo/fetus matures, it takes on more and more human qualities that increase the weight of its rights over that of the mother. When the embryo merely consists of, say, a few dozen cells, then what qualities ***at that moment*** do you see in the embryo that should give it more rights than the mother? \n \n I, for one, place the limit at the start of the third trimester since the fetus starts to have a mind at that point and can probably feel pain and rudimentary thoughts and emotions and the empathy for such a \"person\" leads me to place more weight on its rights than on those of the mother, who already had six months to decide.",

Emotional chaos of the mother is not a compelling enough reason at that stage, at least not for me. I still keep to my belief that it should be generally outlawed at that late stage. I would, however, give my support in some donations and voting for practical and psychological help to be given to these women. I agree that such situations are rare, but laws ultimately have to be based on some common perception of right or wrong, even if the examples of the wrong are a small minority.",

   "Well I happen to believe it is a person too. But there is no way to prove that. When a healthy normal adult is killed by a drunk driver we know for sure that a life has been taken. When a 29 week fetus dies in the whomb wanted or unwanted we cannot actually prove it ever would have lived . If we call a beating heart life then we need to out law abortion as early as 6 weeks. See where I'm going with this?? The Pro-life/Anti choice movment does. And that is why they stared the fetal rights movement becuse there is no good way to legaly difine life in the womb. If you argue it back and forth enough then you come down to life starts at birth or conception- 6weeks. Since many Drs. will not do an abortion before 6weeks ( becuse they simple can not see the pregnacy well to be sure they got it out) then there goes abortion. If you argue it the other way then you will get the very rare late term abortion that the woman is ultimately responible for not her society and you get to keep abortion for all the early women who come in as soon as they miss thier period.\n \n It's not easy, and ulimately something that has at least the potential of being a person if is not yet a person and living a good life is being distroyed. I feel that if the pro-choicers want to keep abortion safe and legal then we need to leave the law at it's looseest intrupritation that it is a womens right to choose to end her pregnancy for whatever reason health , emotions, finances etc. and that her and her care provider are the ones to decide how. You will not see many late term D&X's or other abortion preceedures than you do now. For exactly the reason that you and I agree, most people feel it is a person. But if we legaly difine it this way then we open the door to irradicate abortion and are questioning the age old medical ethic that the mothers life comes first. Then we will have questions about weather a women with severe hypertention at 23 weeks should be forced to stay pregnant as long as possible because a womb is better for the fetus than an incubater? Even though it is threating her life.\n \n The women first and thier health care providers second need to be the ones who choose in all cases never the state.\n \n That said I have an amazing young person in my family who is graduating this year who was born at 24 weeks. At the clinic I work at we don't go passed the first few weeks of the second trimester. As someone who delivers live wanted babies primarily I find it hard and grusome to want to terminate late in pregnancy. It would not be my personal choice to terminate that late if it were me in that situation. If someone with as far left a view as me would still not help in or have an abortion as late as third term you will not find many other people will. Why chance taking away all abortion only to prevent a few that realy have nothing to do with us unless we are the women choosing them or the provider providing them. It is now in many places as it should be ; up to the woman and her Dr. If they feel that's what is best for that situation then I will not sit in judgement.",

I can certainly empathize with it, since I also have the same fears of a slippery-slope where strongly pro-life people will take any loosening of pro-choice stance as an opening to swing the laws to the other extremes. If I were a politician, I might take the same stance that you do - erring on the side of caution in fear of the irrrationality of the other side.

I was also wishing to encourage anyone supporting choice\n to be carfull of how you support it becuase you may accidentaly be working for the other side.\n \n My question was \"In which trimesters SHOULD abortion be outlawed?\" not \"Should we outlaw in all trimesters or in none since we are afraid of the slippery slope\". \n \n My answer is it should not be out lawed in any trimester becuase the reason to outlaw it would be the argument that a fetus has rights as a person. Once something like that goes in to law then you have to define when it is a person and that can't be defined by sicence. It would need to be defined by philosophy or religion. Two things that have no place in law. \n \n \n If, in all of your rational deliberation, you have determined that the mother's right over her own body outweighs that of the fetus at the latest stages, no matter what her reasons are, then that is truly your choice and we can simply agree to disagree. However, if you are only holding your views because you are afraid of the slippery slope, then you are being intellectually disingenuous about your views of how things SHOULD be.\n \n Your thread was a question about how we think things SHOULD BE. What trimesters should it be outlawed. Maybe you meant to ask what trimesters are we morraly comfortable with.\n \n What I am afraid of is not only the slipery slope but of young girls like the one in MI recently who was estimated to be about 24 weeks pregnant who figured she was too far to get an abortion and so she encourged her boyfriend to \"beat the thing out of her\" which he did. He is now facing charges ironicly against the fetus not the girl. \n [B]\n \n What I would do in my life I will not assume is what is best for another in theirs. You also cannot ask at fetus if it wants to be born. At least no one in law would buy it if you did. Therefore it must be the choice of the women. Some people will make what I concider stupid choices. But they are not MY choices. I do not feel I have the right to tell anyone what is right for them and thier body and life. I do not feel the govenment should either. If the fetus is still in the mother than it is a part of her body. Wheather I would make the chioce she makes or not it is for her and her Dr. to decide. Not me. \n \n \nMost of our laws are based on moral considerations that are commonly accepted. History has shown us many societies where murder was much more common and acceptable for many more situations than we accept - our society has a much stricter moral consideration of murder. Our laws are determined by a general concensus of public sense of morals, limited by the consitution. What else can we base our laws on? No one person or group (religious or otherwise) has the right to impose their morals on the majority, but I believe that the majority does have a right to impose morals on the group, as long as they do not impose on rights given to us in the constitution. These types of forums are useful, among other things, to serve as a center of debate to try to reach some general concensus.\n\n \n The problem is is that we cannot know when a fetus becomes a person. I have been to many births where the fetus is born not breathing and with almost no heart rate. By our measures we are usally able to \"bring it to life\" There is a piont at which where it finally takes a breath on is own and you can almost feel it's soul jump into it's body. Other fetuses seem to have personality before even 10 weeks. You cannot say \"I know when a fetus becomes a person and by what I think the law should be based by.\" That would be an opinon based on religious belife because it cannot be proven by science. And that is unconstituional. \n \n When you say \"abortion should be outlawed in the last trimester becuase I feel it is a person.\" than you are stating a religious or Philosphical belife. Not a scienific fact. That is unconstitutional. To say \"I would never have an abortion in the last trimester because I feel it is a person\" then you are making a life choice for your self and to that I say more power to you.\n \n If you want to know what I think morraly not legaly if you are asking would I feel comfortable have a third term abortion then my simple answer is no. I would not. If you don't want a aregument about laws don't ask a question about them.\n \n Now since we're on the same side let's just agree to as you siad disagree. But I do urge you to be careful how you phrase things. :) -X",

   "\n My answer is it should not be out lawed in any trimester becuase the reason to outlaw it would be the argument that a fetus has rights as a person. Once something like that goes in to law then you have to define when it is a person and that can't be defined by sicence. It would need to be defined by philosophy or religion. Two things that have no place in law. \n \n\n I can certainly recognize that a legal definition of personhood would be quite contentious and I certainly would be strongly against such a definition being based on anything other than rational debate based on scientific findings (such as basing views purely on religious or philosophical beliefs). However, I think you are overly pessimistic about how much science can tell us about the beginings of the mind (assuming you accept having a mind as a requirement for personhood). Brain science has progressed a long way since the time when Roe vs Wade was adopted. Though it still has quite a ways to progress, it can already tell us when it would be too early for us to feel and have thoughts and emotions, setting at least a lower limit on the possibility of personhood. There is a good article by Carl Sagan rationally going through the arguments of abortion in the link:\n \n http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml\n \n \n\n What I am afraid of is not only the slipery slope but of young girls like the one in MI recently who was estimated to be about 24 weeks pregnant who figured she was too far to get an abortion and so she encourged her boyfriend to \"beat the thing out of her\" which he did. He is now facing charges ironicly against the fetus not the girl.\n \n\n I have always been uncomfortable with that type of argument. It blames the law for people taking dangerous paths to avoid it. When a law is just, then it is a persons fault if they hurt themselves in trying to avoid it. My question to her would be - why in the world did she wait so long to decide? That's irresponsibility.\n \n \n\n I do not feel I have the right to tell anyone what is right for them and thier body and life. I do not feel the govenment should either. \n\n But that is exactly what laws ARE. Laws are rules which tell people what they can and cannot do, based on a consensus of the majority, limited by the constitution and its inherent separation of church and state (which will hopefully hold). I agree that the right over ones own body is very important and should only be overrulled if there is another critical right which supercedes it. I do not think that the life of a \"potential\" person supercedes a woman's right over her body. However, once a fetus has reached personhood, then the right not to be killed is also a very critical right. I, and apparently most Americans, think it is more important, unless the woman has a critical reason, such as risk of her own life. The results of the poll seem to show Americans also thinking that the second trimester is critical, but I disagree with them unless someone can show a rational, scientifically based reason.\n \n \n\n Now since we're on the same side let's just agree to as you siad disagree. But I do urge you to be careful how you phrase things. :) -X\n\n I can well imagine that pro-life people might enjoy watching pro-choice people argue with each other emoticon_rolleyes. However, I worry that we will never resolve the abortion debate because of precisely the polarization that happens when people are completely distrustfull of the other side. My own view is that, these forums could try to serve a purpose of actual dialogue and mutual understanding and raprochement, not just mutual attacks, and for that we need to be willing to compromise from absolutist positions as well. This forum will by no means affect actual laws. I highly doubt that politicians pay any attention to forums. They do, however, pay attention to general opinion polls, and the only way to change that is to convince people in an honest, cordial, and open way. I might well be naive in this hope and your experience probably has made you completely distrust the pro-life side. Perhaps that is where we will simply have to agree to disagree. I am still clinging to the hope that people want to truly reach some understanding and compromise.",
