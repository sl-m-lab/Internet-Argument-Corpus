Other than that, you're pretty much right. Global warming, or global climate change as it's called now, basically involves alot more energy from the sun being trapped in the atmosphere. Throw more enery into a system and you should expect the system to shift equalibrium and become more energetic.

What we're talking about with regard to the gulf stream is a gradual slowing and diversion over a number of years.\n\n How much did they say the temperature drop was in the movie. I relize that this is very much inland and there for is different, but here in Kansas, it went from 82F to 25F in a matter of 2 to 3 days. And just for the record, back in April, there were tornadoes that touched down in California that people just sat around and took pictures of. An ice shelf broke off of Antartica that had the potential to flood the Nile river for 40 years. Here in the midwest, we have had strong winds. At times, we have had some Very strong winds. (This was really my main complaint with the movie was why are the strong winds in the Midwest that big of a deal. I guess the producers just find the midwest dull and boring. Don't know why, though:p.) Chances are that it probilby would not happen over the course of 2-3 days. But what has happened could set something like that into motion in a matter of 100's-1000's of years. Like any natural disaster movie, it was hyped up for Blockbusterness. Take Twister for instance. The science wasn't too acurate, but the whole idea that Bill Paxton's charicter had of \"Dorthey\" was an actual expierement that NOAH tried. The reason that science fiction movies are \"Science Fiction\" is because we already know something of the science involved that could make part of it real when we try to make a statement on something.

There wouldn't be enough of it to carry away all the heat in a mammoth. If that doesn't make sense, think about being in 32 F air vs. 32 F water. The first is uncomfortable, the second will kill you in a matter of minutes. Water is much denser, and so will suck the heat out of you much faster than air will. Similarly, the upper, upper atmosphere is so thin that the rate at which it can suck heat out of anything is very low. I don't see it as being plausible.",
