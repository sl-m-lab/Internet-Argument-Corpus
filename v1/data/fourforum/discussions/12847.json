   "Let's be very clear about this: when a woman finds herself pregnant due to violence and chooses an abortion, it is the violence that is the tragedy; the abortion is a blessing.\n \n When a woman finds that the fetus she is carrying has anomalies incompatible with life, that it will not live and that she requires an abortion - often a late-term abortion - to protect her life, her health, or her fertility, it is the shattering of her hopes and dreams for that pregnancy that is the tragedy; the abortion is a blessing.\n \n When a woman wants a child but can't afford one because she hasn't the education necessary for a sustainable job, or access to health care, or day care, or adequate food, it is the abysmal priorities of our nation, the lack of social supports, the absence of justice that are the tragedies; the abortion is a blessing.\n \n And when a woman becomes pregnant within a loving, supportive, respectful relationship; has every option open to her; decides she does not wish to bear a child; and has access to a safe, affordable abortion - there is not a tragedy in sight - only blessing. The ability to enjoy God's good gift of sexuality without compromising one's education, life's work, or ability to put to use God's gifts and call is simply blessing.\n \n These are the two things I want you, please, to remember - abortion is a blessing and our work is not done. Let me hear you say it: abortion is a blessing and our work is not done. Abortion is a blessing and our work is not done.

   "Abortion isn't a blessing its a tragedy. Its the termination of a human life and regardless of the circumstances is a sad thing. Abortion after rape doesn't undo the rape its not a magical procedure that somehow undoes the fact that the women was raped. It only terminates her pregnancy from the rape. She still would need counciling, still would need to recover. \n \n Seriously I'm sick of people treating abortion like miracle worker for rape victims at best its a rather clunky band-aid. The only thing that it does is terminate the human growing inside of her. Granted it helps because she doesn't have to deal with the shame and stigma of bearing a rapists child but she still has to bear the stain of being a rapists victim. \n \n Abortion is a fix for being pregnant. It isn't some godsend. It just terminates a pregnancy. Honestly.\n \n And no I'm not pro-life and not a women \"hater\". It just irks me when people treat abortion on the same level as getting stitches.",

   "The Phoenix < News Features < The blessing of abortion\n \n Have done with this never-ending war against women and the murder of abortion providers and their staff.\n \n Have done!\n\n \n I found the woman speaking in this article very interesting. Thanks for posting it, Simone. I think abortion as a \"sad thing\" or \"tragic\" is relative to each person. The American Psychological Association reports that, for many, the overriding feeling is one of relief, because obviously, if you don't want to be pregnant and have a child, there's quite a bit of reality-based stress in that experience, for many. Obviously, too, if a woman is planning a pregnancy and looking forward to motherhood, and, then the development of the fetus veers way off course during the third trimester -- well, that may indeed be tragic for the people. Though, still a blessing that she can get an abortion that will preclude the possibility of her health being seriously compromised or going through the rest of a pregnancy whereupon the fetus' brain is essentially gone and unable to survive outside the womb. There's really no point in \"keeping it on life support\" so to speak, or making the mother go through such an experience unnecessarily. And then, there's her other children to think about ... I think her language makes more sense when the article is read in full, in context. You want the anti-abortion people to have a better understanding and grasp of what women, individually, go through in making these decisions. But, I think, too, that this woman is correct in the perspective she is presenting. Because \"abortion\" per se, or for the most part, is not bad. And I think the pro-choice movement should just tackle that point head on. Sure, it can be disturbing because you're taking a human life in its early developmental stages -- but it's not a sentient, aware person at that point. Certainly not, at the embryo stage. And certainly there can be long term life factors that weigh more heavily against going through with a decision to have a baby. Certainly, if you think it's more than that, then perhaps you shouldn't make that choice. And certainly it's preferable to have prevented a pregnancy through proper use of birth control (with that, too, having a failure rate). Certainly if you're getting one, an earlier abortion is generally preferable (and federal funding would help there! Along with more clinics closer to women's homes!). But to say that everyone is in tragedy over an abortion doesn't ring true to me, at least, based on the people I know who've had them (including illegally, before RVW). They tended to fit the APA profile. The tragedy to me, if any, is just this idiotic ignorance about basic biological development, women's physiology during pregnancy, sexual relationships, along with the nature of sexual assault; the differing religious and non-religious viewspoints about the nature of a fertilized egg or tiny, non-sentient fetus -- that has not developed a brain or nervous system; and this constant, fanatically incessant and judgmental assault on women's personal reproductive decisions, family planning, privacy rights, and right to choose. And even to the point of contradicting every single one of their own rationales or arguments (because they're essentially irrational). There's the tragedy.",

   "It seems to me that the word \"blessing\" is a word suggesting pure goodness, which makes it largely inappropriate to be used in the context of abortion. Abortion is, and should be, a difficult choice - not a choice that is made lightly or joyously - as the use of the word \"blessing\" would suggest. We on the two different sides and even we within the pro-Choice side may have differing opinions on when \"personhood\" and rights to life start within a pregnancy, but I think that we can all agree that, at any stage of a pregnancy, at least a \"potential\" person exists. That in itself should add enough shades of gray in an abortion decision to keep it from being a simple, light and joyous choice that the word \"blessing\" would suggest.\n \n Abortion can be a relief from the agony of carrying a rapist's or adulterer's fetus, but that doesn't make it a \"blessing\". Abortion can be a relief that a risk to a mother's life or health is now averted, but that doesn't make it a \"blessing\". Abortion can be a relief to those that cannot have a new child at that point in their lives (and I would personally expect such decisions would have to be made early on in pregnancy), but that doesn't make it a \"blessing\".",

   "Well ... I don't think it's a light choice for anyone. (Although I'd imagine, for someone who might be developmentally disabled, for example, it might not mean as much. And I suppose some may not care at all.) I don't think it's a decision women necessarily struggle over, either, however. Nor should they. For many women, the course of action that they need to take is quite clear.\n \n That is, whether or not someone 'should' have a difficult time with this decision, I don't agree. And, I don't think women's motivations in getting abortions, or their personal behavior ITO becoming pregnant are anyone else's concern. Or even if they do have an abortion *blithely*. (Distinguishing from policies about public health education.)\n \n I just think people have to do what's right for them. Finding that or reaching a decision -- well, people are different and have different lives. They have different understandings of biology, different health issues, different relationships, different economic positions, different religious views, or none at all. The circumstances around the pregnancy, different.\n \n I don't agree with the \"potentiality\" issue either. If *someone* isn't there *yet*, they're not in existence, period. I think there's just an understandable human reaction to the beginning of life being taken. It's not \"potential\" life. It's life all right. But there's no individual except in our imaginations.\n \n To me, viability, sentience, the development of the nervous system and the brain, and the experience of pain in a fetus during the third trimester begin to mark the ethical boundaries. But those, too, as indicators, are not absolute. And the woman comes first. It's between her and her physician. It's not my job to judge whether she suffered appropriately enough or not. And I don't think anyone should have go through any demonstrative motions one way or the other for the anti-abortion camp. It's none of their business.",

   "\"I\" did not exist at that time.\n\n \n Biologically speaking,... you most certainly did exist even at the time of your conception. \n \n That (conception) is the moment your life biologically began. That's the moment your aging began, your sex was determined, your race, eye and hair color all began at that moment (conception) and biologically speaking YOUR individual existence began at that moment as well.\n \n This (ours) is possibly the greatest divide in the abortion debate. A divide between those who believe the Constitution protects the \"physical being\" the \"biological\" being and who conclude that is where personhood comes from,... and those (like yourself and Chester) who bring the \"metaphysical\" criteria for \"personhood\" into the debate. (i.e. brainwaves, ability to feel pain, souls, etc.)\n \n Whether you chose to believe it or not,... your life as a human individual human organism (being) physically began at and by your conception. I believe the Constitution protects the \"physical\" being and should be indifferent to the metaphysical,..... while you and your ilk (who oft claim to want a separation between church and state) cling to the \"metaphysical\" when it comes to deciding when a person's life begins. \n \n I'm confident that the SCOTUS wll eventually conclude as I have that it's the biological aspects which qualifies a human being for personhood and not the \"metaphysical\" aspects such as \"when the soul enters the body\" or \"can for a cognitive thought\" or any of that kind of pap.\n \n \n Your position is purely faith based, whether you choose to say you are taking a religious position or not. The picture is of a fertilized egg. It is not a child with rights, Chuzlife.\n\n \n I understand your need to tie my views to religion. However, it's simply not the case. If anything, your views are more in the relm of metaphysics than mine. I use a secularly sound scientific approach in making my determinations. I use pure biology and nothing else; to determine that a human life biologically begins at their conception. And that's good enough for me as I respect the weight and significance of the word \"begin.\" A \"person's\" life begins when it begins,... it's incumbent upon me to respect that moment whenever it is,.... and it's not for me to arbitrarily pick the criteria for someone else's \"personhood\" based upon MY comfort level or convienience. I live my life around the facts,... I don't change the definitions and dismiss those facts to suit my own personal convienience or want for pragmatism.\n \n Like I said,... it comes down to a respect for the weight and meaning of the word \"begin\" as it is used in the question of \"when does a person's life begin?\"\n \n For me, it's the earliest moment that their life can be detected biologically. It's the point at which their biological aging began, etc. The onus is on me to prove they are NOT a person or that a denial of their rights can be justified (as in cases of rape or life of the mother)\n \n For you, it's when you just can deny them their personhood any longer. You place the onus on the new child; your require him or her to be able to breech your ability to deny them before you will finally, reluctantly accept them as a \"person.\" \n \n \n You are free to act as if it is, with a fertilized egg in your body. But no one else's body and what is going inside it at that point in time is any of your concern or business or mine.\n \n And the law is behind my opinion, not yours.\n\n \n A child has a right to their life from the momen their life begins. We both likely agree on that. \n \n I feel that it is my duty as a responsible citizen to stand in defense of children who are being denied their rights and due process.

(Distinguishing from policies about public health education.)\n \n I just think people have to do what's right for them. Finding that or reaching a decision -- well, people are different and have different lives. They have different understandings of biology, different health issues, different relationships, different economic positions, different religious views, or none at all. The circumstances around the pregnancy, different.\n\n I would agree that, for many women, the choice is clear but that doesn't mean that it should be a choice that is taken lightly. I have similar views to you that there should be no legal rights granted until there is \"someone home\" in the body that is developing - I have often used the same language as you do in my arguements to those on the pro-life side. However, I do not view the pre-sentient body as equivalent to an organ or tumor since there is a critical difference in that, if left alone, it highly likely WILL develop into a human being like you and me - something that you clearly cannot say about the organ or tumor. That is worth consideration enough for the abortion decision to not be taken lightly, even in early term. Of course, as long as one leaves early term abortions legal, as I would, one cannot legislate how lightly or seriously various women take that decision so all I can do is bemoan the blindness of spirit in those women that take abortion decisions so lightly that they do not give that potential ANY consideration.\n \nI don't agree with the \"potentiality\" issue either. If *someone* isn't there *yet*, they're not in existence, period. I think there's just an understandable human reaction to the beginning of life being taken. It's not \"potential\" life. It's life all right. But there's no individual except in our imaginations.\n\n But there WILL BE if left alone to develop. That potential makes the difference between an embryo / early fetus vs an organ or tumor that it is sometimes compared to. I certainly agree a potential person is not yet a person and, thus, doesn't yet have rights, but that potential is not nonexistence or insignificant. Again, if one leaves early abortions freely accessible, one cannot then legislate how seriously the person takes the decision - ex. whether they take potentiality into account. I am simply complaining against those who do take the decision lightly (and I do agree that it is probably the minority).\n \nTo me, viability, sentience, the development of the nervous system and the brain, and the experience of pain in a fetus during the third trimester begin to mark the ethical boundaries. But those, too, as indicators, are not absolute. And the woman comes first. It's between her and her physician. It's not my job to judge whether she suffered appropriately enough or not. And I don't think anyone should have go through any demonstrative motions one way or the other for the anti-abortion camp. It's none of their business.\n\n I have similar views that it is only in late term that rights might start when what I've called \"mental existence\" can start kicking in. Before that, the only thing that exists is a potential person - not a real one. However, that potential is not nothing.",

An 80 year old woman is someone's \"child.\" As is a prebirth child which is still in the first few hours of his or her life. The only comparison (similarities) that need be made is the fact that they are all the product of human sexual reproduction, that they are the \"young\" of their parents and that they are scientifically distinguishable from other living organisms (they are individuals.) \n \n Have you never studied the life cycle of a human being, Shooter?\n \n \n I can take any group of cells and compare it to another group of cells. That doesn't make it a person. We must compare the embryo to someone we can all agree is a person.\n\n \n Again, your premise is flawed. Where do you get that a prebirth child in the embryonic stage of their life has to be comparable to a 3 year old,... for them to be recognized as a \"child?\" There is no such requirment in any dictionary or any other references I have found. \n \n It appears that you are placing a higher (personal) standard for personhood than the dictionaries and other references I have provided do. \n \n \n It has the potential to become a human being, but it would be foolish to value a potential human being over an actual human bieng.\n\n \n What is neither \"human\" nor \"existant\" in a living human embryo, Shooter?\n \n Is a human embryo not \"human?\"\n \n Is a human embryo not \"alive?\"\n \n Does a human embryo not \"exist?\"\n \n I hear this \"potential\" argument made a lot,... but it seems that any rationally thinking person could determine for themselves that when you terminate (kill) a mere \"potential\" human being, you don't have a REAL dead body after the procedure.\n \n And a human embryo, however small and deniable it may be to you,... is in fact a \"potential\" that has already been realised. The \"potential\" child that you are grasping for in your reasoning is the \"potential child\" that only existed in the \"potential\" for pregnancy (prior to his/her conception.)\n \n I'm not going to waste much more of my time teaching you what you should have learned in biology class, Shooter. There are several in these forums who are already accepting of the fact that an individual's life biologically begins at conception,... that a prebirth child is more than a mere \"potential\" etc.\n \n If you really want to debate these aspects further,...

Just personally, I don't think it *should* be a lightly made decision, though it's obviously not an area for legal intervention. I think you make a good point about the \"pure goodness\" implicit in calling abortion a \"blessing\". One of the problems in the debate is that it's sometimes hard to convey that abortion isn't this pure goodness OR pure evil. It's a complex decision where right and wrong for any person is arrived at by weighing out any number of greatly varying factors. We'd like life and death to be simple, but it often isn't in a lot of ways.\n \n I don't see it as comparable to removing a tumor, either. Chester I'm sure can speak for himself, but the understanding I get as to how that analogy works is more that (a) it may be just that to a given individual, and if so, that's no one's business but their own, however appalling that might seem to some; and (b) there's a truth in the notion because, absent an added or metaphysical notion regarding the fetus' existence, in purely scientific terms, an abortion is basically the equivalent to any other kind of surgery.\n \n I don't see it that way, myself, but the comparison serves to make a certain point about all we really do know about the nature of human development at that point in time.\n \n The beginning of a human being's development is awesome and mind-blowing and fantastic. Wouldn't it be great if it could just keep going and everything could be wonderful?\n \n But we know it's not that simple because motherhood is a big responsibility, a big decision.

Well, while we're admiring the grandeur of cell division and what it can become, that's a world apart from 9 months later and now there really is a sentient human being who the mother must put her life's energy into.\n \n Only she can make that decision, IMO.

Neither have I heard too many pro-life advocates rejoice in the idea of forcing a woman to carry an unwanted pregnancy. Both sides simply concentrate on their particular grievance - pro-life's view that even early fetuses/embryos deserve life and are deprived of it unfairly, vs pro-choice's view that a woman deserves rights over her own body and it is unjust to deprive her of those rights.\n \nOnly she can make that decision, IMO. No one else.\n\n Just to check, do you mean that only for the first and second trimester, or do you mean that for the third trimester as well? I ask because you also seemed to start giving consideration to the now potentially sentient fetus in late term. Would you impose restrictions on abortion rights in the third trimester?",

I've stated a number of times that, I think, as a fetus develops (in a normal pregnancy), when you enter the third trimester, you start to cross ethical boundaries. But even there, ultimately, the decision rests with the woman, after consultation with her physician. And the woman comes first.
