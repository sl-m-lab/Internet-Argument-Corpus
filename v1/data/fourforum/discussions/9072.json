Christians arnt allowed to wear theirs so its only fair muslims shouldnt and vice versa. Bollocks I have a right practice my faith in the sunlight as does muslims, jews etc!\nWell the second case was about Muslims, not Christians. The point is in neither case was it really about religion. Religion shouldn't get special dispensation just because it's a religion. BA had a policy that said all jewelry should be worn under the uniform if practical. This goes for all religions, all beliefs, all staff. A dress code is a dress code. If you don't like it, don't work there. Does this mean that a pacifist working for BA has the right to wear a peace badge because it's what they believe? No visible jewelry means that. And that's all there is to it.\n \n As for the Muslim, it obviously impairs her ability to do her job. Children learn through facial expression. To cut that off from your teacher obviously means they aren't learning as they should be. Equally if she was wearing a balaclava in class or a motor cycle helmet or a Scream mask. Again nothing to do with religion, if it impairs the job then it's fair to tell you not to do it. Religion doesn't get dispensation.\n \n \n \nwhat exaclty do you read, the Daily sport perhaps?\n \n Sorry, just trying to make a point.\nWhoa, cheap shot.

We're so shocked and dismayed by this we've devoted 17 full colour pages to the wild excess\". Though you're right in a way. I suppose the days when the paper supported the British Union of Fascists and those friendly chaps called the National Socialist German Workers Party they were giving a voice to a minority...\n \n Face it.

The Broadsheets use different tactics to reach their national demographic that appeal to their sense of superiority over the tabloid readers in order for them to manipulate and in a sense direct your thought process. The Broadsheets become a member of your peer group but are controlled by people outside your peer group wanting to control and manpulate it.\n \n The same goes for all class backgrounds, the mainstream tabloids are the papers of the common man they do the same thing to their national demographic until you hit the bottom The Star and The Sport Mindless trash that helps create and sustain the underclasses\n \n \n A man on the dole, on heroin etc can be more inteligent than Richard Branson or some lord or lady.\n \n To tell you the truth I dont read any Local or National Newspaper, I Very Rarely watch the TV its all full of manipulation targeted at different classes.

It continually scare mongers, expecially over immigration.\n \n \n \ntacky sensationilism, Rupert Murdoch's News Corportation has a lot to answer for.\nHey, you won't get disagreement from me over that.\n \n \n \nSteady phunting, your almost coming across as an interlectual facist, you are wrong to blame the people who read tabloids. Interlect has very little to do with what paper you read... A man on the dole, on heroin etc can be more inteligent than Richard Branson or some lord or lady.\nWell it wouldn't be the first time! Personally I believe what paper you read has nothing to do with what class you are. I know plenty of my 'middle class peers' who read tabloids and plenty of working class people who read broadsheets. I think it's rubbish to say that the only paper you can read is based according to your class. You mention education, well we have national education. Everyone regardless of class has the ability to use the skills they have been taught to read and understand a proper paper. The fact that the majority of the population don't is what I despair of.\n \n \nthrefore it is quite ignorant to say Broadsheet readers are intelligent and tabloid readers have a lack of intelligence or as phunting put it.\nThis is slightly misrepresenting my point. My point was that a large part of The Mail's readership seem to read it because they are guilty of exactly what you level at me. They consider themselves better than 'tabloid' readers and actually think the Mail is any better than the others because it doesn't have a red top. The Sun is under no illusions about what it is, and doesn't take itself too seriously. The Mail however presents itself as an intellectual's, or shall we say educated person's paper. And doesn't seem to understand that it really really isn't.\n \n \n \nThe TV is an XXXXXX LANTERN\nSo how is my distain of tabloids ignorant snobbery but yours of television justified? Or of the Star and Sport?",

What started as an appeal to the French knightly class quickly turned into a wholesale migration and conquest of territory outside of Europe. Both knights and peasants from many different nations of western Europe, with little central leadership, travelled over land and by sea towards Jerusalem and captured the city in July 1099, establishing the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the other Crusader states. Although these gains lasted for fewer than two hundred years, the First Crusade was a major turning point in the expansion of Western power, and was the only crusade to capture Jerusalem.\n \nYes I believe bringing the Good news to the people in south america was a Good thing to sanction, obviously the church can not be held accountable for the actions of Armies under the command of individuals... No problem with sanctioning the bringing of the Gospel to the Americas whatsoever.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquistador\n \n The leaders of Spanish expeditions to the New World called themselves conquistadores, a name expressing the similarity of conquests in the New World to the recently accomplished reconquista, the Christian crusades to conquer or (re)conquer the Iberian peninsula from the Muslim Moors, recently sealed with the conquest of Granada (1492). The conquistadors also invoked the name of Santiago Matamoros (\"St James the Moor-killer\") before going into battle against the native population of the Americas, who were considered without rights as long as they were \"pagan\" (not converted to Catholicism). Their lands were annexed as belonging to Christendom with papal blessing, the only rival claim to be taken seriously was that of the Portuguese, settled after papal arbitration in the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494.The leaders of Spanish expeditions to the New World called themselves conquistadores, a name expressing the similarity of conquests in the New World to the recently accomplished reconquista, the Christian crusades to conquer or (re)conquer the Iberian peninsula from the Muslim Moors, recently sealed with the conquest of Granada (1492).

Hispanic honor rules for nobility banned them from manual work.\n \n Some were also fleeing the religious repression caused by the Spanish Inquisition. . . .Most of the conquistadors cruelly mistreated the inhabitants of the regions they visited or conquered; killing, enslaving, raping and otherwise abusing them in a way that, however, may not have been really different of the one inflicted by other contemporary European powers (England, France, Portugal, the Netherlands, etc.) in their colonies but, due to the much larger native population which the Spaniards met, may have become much more obvious. . . .",

   "I have studied scripture as a Prostestant, without scripture being filtered through the dogma of the Roman Catholic Church.\n I had some e-mail correspondence with the author of The Courage to be Catholic: Crisis, Reform, and the Future of the Church, George Weigel, asking him specifically about why women could not be priests. His response was that \"Women do not 'resemble' Christ, He who served the original Last Supper.\" OK, what is the one specific thing that a man has that a woman does not--a penis. End of story.\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Crusade\n \n The First Crusade was launched in 1095 by Pope Urban II with the stated goal of capturing the sacred city of Jerusalem and the Holy Land from Muslims. What started as an appeal to the French knightly class quickly turned into a wholesale migration and conquest of territory outside of Europe. Both knights and peasants from many different nations of western Europe, with little central leadership, travelled over land and by sea towards Jerusalem and captured the city in July 1099, establishing the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the other Crusader states. Although these gains lasted for fewer than two hundred years, the First Crusade was a major turning point in the expansion of Western power, and was the only crusade to capture Jerusalem.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquistador\n \n The leaders of Spanish expeditions to the New World called themselves conquistadores, a name expressing the similarity of conquests in the New World to the recently accomplished reconquista, the Christian crusades to conquer or (re)conquer the Iberian peninsula from the Muslim Moors, recently sealed with the conquest of Granada (1492). The conquistadors also invoked the name of Santiago Matamoros (\"St James the Moor-killer\") before going into battle against the native population of the Americas, who were considered without rights as long as they were \"pagan\" (not converted to Catholicism). Their lands were annexed as belonging to Christendom with papal blessing, the only rival claim to be taken seriously was that of the Portuguese, settled after papal arbitration in the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494.The leaders of Spanish expeditions to the New World called themselves conquistadores, a name expressing the similarity of conquests in the New World to the recently accomplished reconquista, the Christian crusades to conquer or (re)conquer the Iberian peninsula from the Muslim Moors, recently sealed with the conquest of Granada (1492).

Hispanic honor rules for nobility banned them from manual work.\n \n Some were also fleeing the religious repression caused by the Spanish Inquisition. . . .Most of the conquistadors cruelly mistreated the inhabitants of the regions they visited or conquered; killing, enslaving, raping and otherwise abusing them in a way that, however, may not have been really different of the one inflicted by other contemporary European powers (England, France, Portugal, the Netherlands, etc.) in their colonies but, due to the much larger native population which the Spaniards met, may have become much more obvious. . . .\n\n \n Nor was their treatment very much different from the treatment meted out by the native peoples to each other!!

   "The point you made was that you think that because a turbin won't fit under clothing, and that a small cross will, then they allowed the tubin to be worn as-is, and the cross in a non-visible way. With that logic, then all she should need to do is bring a larger cross to get equal treatment as the guy with the turbin. Do you understand what I'm saying? The issue is that one was allowed to practice the display of their religion, and the other person was not.\n \n The turbin is either on or off no other option. It does not come in hide away sizes. Wearing it is an important part of thier religion. Wearing a cross is not part of Christianity. God never said wear a cross. It is a choice for many different reasons, none having to do with religious requirements. Is that starting to make a little more sense?\n \n It certainly IS a religious conflict if her religion dictates her to wear it visibly. But either way, because one was allowed religious display, and the other wasn't, then there's a lack of equal treatment. THAT'S the issue. And furthermore, it's not the airlines' place to determine what the employee's religion dictates them do. They need to either eliminate all forms of religious display for everyone, or allow any by everyone. Otherwise it's a form of inequality. That's the bottom line here.\n \n \n That is a big IF in that conflict since it doesn't exist. The intent is to adhere to relious doctrine not show off what religion you are. When the Bible says Christians have to wear a cross then you have an arguement. \n \n It is impossible to please all the all the time. How many would cry foul if there was a complete lock down of all forms of religion in any company? \n \n \"Offensiveness\" and \"grossness\" were not stated by the airline as the reason they prevented her from displaying her religion. If it had been, you might have a point.\n\n \n You did not even come close to understanding what I was saying. Nevermind",

   "Effectively all Europe. The Arabs and then their descendants came out of Arabia and invaded and conquered what is known now as the Middle East (iraq and Iran) including Palestine and Israel, all of modern Turkey, The whole of North Africa, tw0 thirds of Spain, Sicily. They then spread across much of Africa, infiltrated into India after taking over Afghanistan. They invaded France from the South. After the fall of the Byzantine Empire they took over Greece, the Balkan States and pushed up towards the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Mediterranean became virtually an Islamic sea and their sailors pushed into the East Indies and raided England for slaves. This of course took place over several hundred years and was coupled with the Mongol Invasion coming through Russia and threatening Poland.\n \n Europe had quite a fight on its hands. The Crusades were one element, the battles of Chalons, Lepanto the seiges of Malta and Vienna were all key areas in turning back Islam. Finally Greece and the Balkan states broke free with the remains of the Turkish empire being dismembered after the 1st World War\n\n \n \n \n This way off topic detour started with my response to a statement that the crusades were to protect the Christian homeland of Juresalem from the invading Arabs. My question was to point out that Juresalem was an Arab land and repossesion is maybe more accurate. \n \n There were a total of 9 Crusades from 1096 - 1272. Although the primary reason was to protect Christian pilgrams and gain control of Juresalm. The purposes became less and less about Chrstians and more and more political with time. With crusaders making detours like the sacking of Constantinople as an example. \n \n While there were many battles and invasions and wars my response was not did Muslims ever take European soil by force but were the Crusades really about stopping an invasion into the Christian homeland.",
