   "Generally speaking, low. From what I understand they generally have an over achieving area of the brain that leads to some overachievement in whatever functions that area contributes to. Like numbers, music, visuals/art, etc. Because they lack the raw intelligence and social skills, they seem to be able to neither achieve easily in society, nor contribute more than extraordinary duplication or \"functions\", without much (or any) creative ability or ability to apply their skills without assistance to society.\n \n Calculating prime numbers in the millions in seconds, in your head, or playing an entire song from memory after hearing it once, is amazing, no doubt, but they are task oriented, not really pushing the frontier of those disciplines. Basically a computer could perform the same functions, just fast cycle time, no real \"intelligence\" contribution. That is to say, for a handicap, it has an interesting side to it, but it's still in general a mental handicap/irregularity that possible we could prevent in the future. That's a clinical reflection, not an emotional one. \n \n -Mach",

   "What is an idiot savant? \n emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n What is an idiot savant? \n \n Current research theories show that intelligence is non-local and not bound to the brain. Sometimes nature offers insight into a particular subject by presenting a baffling enigma and contradictory example. Intelligence's contradictory enigma is the idiot-savant. \n \n The word idiot usually refers to a simpleton, in contrast to the word \"savant\" in French that means \"learned one.\" Idiot savants are a subgroup of a class of people called XXXXXX with an IQ of about 25. \n \n Idiot savants are a group of humans that are incapable of learning, writing or reading, yet they have unlimited access to specific, accurate knowledge in the fields of mathematics, music, and other precise areas. Now the irony of an idiot-savant is that this group of individuals does not acquire knowledge by learning as the average human does. They mysteriously 'know' explicit, exact, correct information. One may wonder: \"How do XXXXXX savants know certain information or possess certain skills?\" By whatever means they obtain this information, they undermine current definitions about intelligence. Does their knowledge show that a source of intelligence exists? Is it possible to tap into this source and not know of its existence? \n \n Dustin Hoffman made idiot-savants famous in the Hollywood movie \"Rain Man.\" He played the role of a mathematical genius able to keep track of cards at the casino, yet unable to go to the bathroom alone or to make simple decisions about what clothes to wear or foods to eat. Modern science cannot explain this phenomenon. \n \n \n http://www.plim.org/2idiots.html",

   "hi; newbie here. I assume u r trying to stimulate discussion of the larger question: what is intelligence? \n \n I think the standard I.Q. tests measure verbal and mathematic facility or the conceptual abilities arising therein,, and as such delimit \"intelligence\" narrowly to those abilities, per se.\n \n imo, this is a good example of defining/normalizing human capability merely as that which can be measured  in conventional way, and so limiting it narrowly in self reflexive terms.\n \n I would argue for a broader definition of human (animal?) intelligence. Or for at least not equating ALL intelligence (\"I.Q.\") with that which is mensurable by the necessarily limited number of categorical tests so far devised.\n \n WE know, at least since Wittgenstein, that language is hugely defective, at best. So why should we trust it to measure AND define \"intelligence\" simultaneously? Might there not be a great deal more to it? Certainly i.s.'s have more of something. To confine \"intelligence\" to so small a box is a categorical mistake of the first order, imo.\n \n If so called idiot savants designed the tests, we of (presumably) high verbal/math intelligence would trade places with them on the \"I.Q. scale; we would appear stupid, due to our total lack of the amazing facilities which they exhibit. \n \n cheers.",
