   "You are not getting it. When Jesus was born there were wise men following a star, Angels told shepherds of his birth, Mary and Joseph were both told he was the son God, Herod killed the innocents etc. But when he starts his ministry nobody knows him. These events surrounding his birth that heralded his coming seem to have been forgotten. Even his family seems to have forgotten. To say that later it was recorded does nothing to address what happened at the time it was important.\n\n \n It's because he wasn't known at that time, publicly, to begin with. He was born in a 'town' that was basically just a settlement--Bethlehem. His parents were probably pretty poor and the equivalent of peasants. Herod never even knew specifically who it was he was looking for. The wise men weren't from that area. \n Given all that, it's MORE likely Jesus wouldn't have been known by the start of his ministry.\n \n I think this thread of yours is really grasping at straws, frankly.",
