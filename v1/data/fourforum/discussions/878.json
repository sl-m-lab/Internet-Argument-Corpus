   "I find it easy to compare this to Scientific Theory. \n \n When Isaac Newton propsed his theory of gravitation, it was clear that it was one of the greatest intellectual feats of all time. The theory, as always, explained the observed facts and made predictions, later tested and found correct, with the accuracy of instruments being used. So, at the time, everyone could see that this was clearly, the truth.\n \n Einstein later proposed his theory of Relativity which explained different observed facts, accompanied by some other predictions. Those are now accepted as being correct with the accuracy of the instruments used. So now, as far as anyone can see tis is the truth.\n \n So how can these both be the truth? When a theory is said to be \"true\" it means that it agrees with all known experimental evidence. \n \n So, alike to a theorum, truth is based on the facts and observatiosn provided. Some things might be irrelevant to the time. Thousands of years ago, people burnt animals to the offering to honor God. This was seen as completely normal, so many did this. It instructs in The Bible how to give an offering. However, we do not apply this today, in some cases, we must take a more liberal approach.",

If he could then that is a characteristic of being all powerful but if he couldn't, that would also be a characteristic of being all powerful. Either way he would display characteristics of being all powerful while braking characteristics of being all powerful. There are thousands of similar situations where God would need to be limited.

I would need an example. \n \n You may be interested to know that the teaching prohibiting contraception was universally held by all Christians  (not just Catholics) until the very recent time of 1930. In 1930 at the Lambeth conference Anglicans allowed a limited use of contraception. Other denominations followed and the limited use eroded. The Catholic Church has maintained her position on contraception throughout the ages. I understand that some fundamentalist churches also teach against contraception.\n \n \nThat is kind of a trick question when asked within this debate. No, my denomination does not claim infallibility in anything. However, birth control and other similar doctrines are not essential doctrines (I stated the essentials in earlier post).\n \n \n My point was not really to trick you. But if the essentials are the basis for all of my faith then I WANT someone to claim that they could infallibly teach these things. And furthermore if a church cannot guide you without doubt on the essentials then why would they be any better at guiding you on the \"nonessentials?\" But I must find the church that has the most legitimate claim of an ability to teach infallibly. Jesus was infallible and he passed this charism on to his chosen leadership.",
