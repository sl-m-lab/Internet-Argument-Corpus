   "New report reveals high numbers of hate crimes \n \n November 21, 2005 -- The real number of hate crimes in the United States is more than 15 times higher than FBI statistics reflect, according to a stunning new government report. \n Hate crime statistics published by the FBI since 1992, based on voluntary reports from law enforcement agencies around the country, have shown annual totals of about 6,000 to 10,000, depending on the year. But the new report, \u00fdHate Crimes Reported by Victims and Police,\u00fd found an average annual total of 191,000 hate crimes. That means the real level of hate crime runs between 19 and 31 times higher than the numbers that have been officially reported for almost 15 years. \n \n \"It's an astounding report,\" said Jack Levin, a leading hate crime expert at Northeastern University. \"It's not necessarily completely accurate, but I would trust these data before I trusted the voluntary law enforcement reports to the FBI.\" \n \n The new report, compiled by the Bureau of Justice Statistics and published this month, was based on an analysis of three-and-a-half years of detailed survey data from the biannual National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). The NCVS raw data comes from interviews with almost 80,000 statistically representative people and is the most accurate crime survey extant. \n \n The report, which inferred hate motivation from the words and symbols used by the offender, found that just 44 percent of hate crimes are reported to police. Other hate crimes don't make it into FBI statistics for an array of reasons: police may fail to record some as hate crimes; their departments may not report hate crime statistics to state officials; and those officials may not accurately report to the FBI. \n \n According to the new report, hate crimes involve violence far more often than other crimes. The data showed 84 percent of hate crimes were violent, meaning they involved a sexual attack, robbery, assault or murder. By contrast, just 23 percent of non-hate crimes involved violence. Other studies have suggested that hate-motivated violence, especially against homosexuals, is more extreme than other violence. \n \n The report also showed that 56 percent of hate crime victims identified race as the primary factor in the crimes they reported. Ethnicity accounted for another 29 percent of the total. Hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation were 18 percent of the total. Given that the best studies indicate about 3 percent of the American population is homosexual, this means that gays and lesbians are victimized at six times the overall rate. \n \n http://www.splcenter.org/intel/news/item.jsp?site_area=1&aid=145",

Basically this article is just saying there may be more hate crimes because the police don't always determine it to be a hate crime. But if the police don't determine it to be so, then how can one say it was indeed a crime in the first place? There's no official way to know if something is a crime or not without police determining it to be so, espcially when we're talking about something so subjective as hate crimes. It seems to me that this is no more accurate than FBI statistics. I'd sooner trust the determination of those who know the law and enforce it and are therefore better qualified to say whether a particular activity is a crime or not.",

I would say a man who commits crimes against any group equally is a greater danger than one who strikes out against only a certain group. The measure of punishment should fit the severity, not what race or sexual orientation it was directed against. The greatest and fastest way, imo of course, of reaching the goal of equality if for the law to treat a crime against a gay man exactly as they would treat a crime against a straight man. Not more severe, not less severe.\n \n You are right that gay people might 'unofficially' be treated as less than equal by those who enforce the law, but I am unsure how making special laws (to be ignored) would help this. Actions such as those can only be attributed to the local culture, because it depends on the community to tolerate it. Laws do not change people's minds, Kronus.

I base this largely on the observation that many haters are also somewhat cowardly, and only act if they think they have some support for their actions.

But I would have to say that we should arrest these people for the crime they commit. The first step to making gays/lesbians not second class citizens is making them equal in the eyes of the law.

   " Also, the cases you cited are not cases of making what is already a criminal law more easily punished, as in the case of hate crime laws. \n\n Assault is already illegal. The anti-wife-battery laws just make prosecution of abusive husbands easier. There are many other cases. Robbery with a gun, even if it isn't pulled out, is worse than robbery without a gun. Assault on mailmen is worse than general assault. Shooting a cop is worse than shooting a civilian. Those are just off the top of my head. Providing stiffer penalites for breaking existing laws in a specific way is a routine way for the government to try to prevent certain specific types of crimes. Hate crime laws are just one of many, many, laws that follow that practice.\n \n \n\n But those are only cases where hate is obvious.

And people are much, much more likely to go out searching for gays to beat up than they are to go hunting for supporters of the wrong sports team.\n \n Like it or not, motivation is an important factor in determining punishment. There are something like a half dozen different classifications for murder. The victim is equally dead in each case. The difference is motive. If it's an accident, a fit of rage, or premeditated is crucial for determining what the sentence will be.\n \n \n\n Because it is preferential treatment and violates the spirit if not the letter of \"equal protection\". The view that gays deserve more protection from the exact same crime is offensive to me. There is nothing about sexual orientation that would make one worse off from an attack, so there is nothing that warrants stricter sentences for their attackers.\n\n Then you object to stricter sentences for people who shoot cops? I couldn't quite understand your answer to that before.",

   "\n I'm sorry, I'm having trouble parsing that sentence. What do you mean by \"makes it worse if you attack them\"? Do you mean if their bones are extra brittle or something like that?\n\n \n It means what it says. The example you gave would be a valid reason, if gay people, as a group, had extra brittle bones I would support legislation that gave stricter sentences for attacking gay people. Or, in the case of cops, if gay people, as a group, were routinely in harms way to protect the general population and provided an essential service I would the same legislation if they were targeted more often.\n \n I don't see how this is relevant anymore, since with the rest of the post you change your argument from the group of the victim to the motivation of the attacker for the justification of hate crime laws.\n \n \n\n You misunderstood. Allow me to clarify. Attacking a man who happens to be gay is no worse than attacking anyone else. Attacking a gay man because he is gay is worse. It's considered worse because it happens so frequently. If someone beat up a straight man because he thought he was gay it would be just as bad. It's the motivation of the attacker that is the issue, not the state of the victim.\n \n That is not how the law works. The crime is not worse if the victem just happens to belong to certain groups. The crime is worse if you attack someone because they belong to that group. Alot of people attack others because they belong to certain groups and for no other reason, and the law is trying to put a stop to that.\n \n The difference being that people get beaten up much, much more frequently for being gay than they do for supporting the wrong sports team.

There are something like a half dozen different classifications for murder. The victim is equally dead in each case. The difference is motive. If it's an accident, a fit of rage, or premeditated is crucial for determining what the sentence will be.\n\n \n Dolus, or intent, is the basis for criminal responsibility, not motive. They are separate, but related. The presence of a motive (but not what that motive is) is used with intent to distinguish blameworthy and non-blameworthy incidents.\n \n That one motive happens more often than another is not a reason by itself to increase a sentence. We do not prosecute because of beliefs, we prosecute actions taken. The examples you gave of \"premeditated\" \"fit of rage\" and \"accident\" are not different motives, they are different intents and different actions which merit different sentences. They can have the same motive (\"I hate gay people\") between premeditated and fit of rage (negligence, or culpa, doesn't have a motive) but different intent. The motive, or inducement of the crime, generally does not factor into the sentencing because we do not prosecute beliefs held, only actions taken. Except in hate crime laws, of course.\n \n You won't change beliefs or motives with these laws, Kronus, because laws do not change minds, only behavior.

Chances are, I can find a group that gets 'beat up' more regularly than gays.

I understand you view, though--you feel that because gays are attacked as a minority, that should be made up for by more protections.

Applying the law across the board is the correct way without hate crime laws.\n \n I found Mitchell's argument more compelling, which is probably not surprising since I disagree with hate crime laws in general. It expressed some of my thoughts better than I could myself :P\n \n But the fact remains that under the Wisconsin statute the same criminal conduct may be more heavily punished if the victim is selected because of his race or other protected status than if no such motive obtained. Thus, although the statute punishes criminal conduct, it enhances the maximum penalty for conduct motivated by a discriminatory point of view more severely than the same conduct engaged in for some other reason or for no reason at all. Because the only reason for the enhancement is the defendant's discriminatory motive for selecting his victim, Mitchell argues (and the Wisconsin Supreme Court held) that the statute violates the First Amendment by punishing offenders' bigoted beliefs.\n\n and\n \n But it is equally true that a defendant's abstract beliefs, however obnoxious to most people, may not be taken into consideration by a sentencing judge. Dawson v. Delaware, 503 U. S. ---- (1992)\n\n \n The Supreme Court decided that hate crime laws are an extension of antidiscrimination laws that make it \"unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee \"because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin\". I don't believe this can be extended as it is because firing someone for another reason or no reason at all carries no penalty, while attacking someone under any other reason or no reason at all is still illegal, and motive should not change the criminality of the act.

So, do you have other reasons?\n\n \n \n Psychological damage, I have already stated that above. Do you not read the full post. \n \n Read this artilce:\n What is the difference between a hate crime and any other crime?\n \n \n What sets hate crimes apart from other acts of violence is the psychological damage that they leave behind. Although any type of victimization carries with it psychological consequences, certain types of emotional reactions are more frequent among survivors of hate crimes. These feelings include depression, anxiety, fear, stress and anger. The American Psychological Association has determined that victims of hate crimes suffer the symptoms of post-traumatic stress for up to five years, in comparison to two years for victims of non-bias-related crimes.\n \n Hate crime laws are laws that enhance the penalties imposed by the courts for individuals convicted of acts of bias-related violence. These laws, although controversial, are designed to act as a deterrent by punishing hate crime perpetrators more severely than those who commit similar types of violent acts that are not motivated by hatred. Forty-two states and the District of Columbia have laws against hate crimes. Of those, 21 include sexual orientation in categories protected. Washington State law protects victims of hate crimes based on sexual orientation.\n \n Finally, survivors of hate crimes are less likely than victims of other types of violence to report attacks against them to the police. It has been estimated that up to 80% of bias-crimes are never reported to the authorities. There are many reasons for this. Minority groups, including GLBT communities, have historically had strained relations with law enforcement and fear that crimes against them will not be taken seriously or that the police reaction will be unsympathetic or hostile.\n \n In addition, survivors of anti-GLBT hate crimes may also be concerned that reporting attacks against them may expose them to increased risk by being \"outed\" to families and communities as a sexual minority. In many parts of the country (though not in King County, WA), individuals can be fired from jobs or evicted from their rental homes just for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. Many hate crime survivors suffer the trauma of victimization in silence rather than to expose themselves to these forms of \"secondary victimization.\" \n \n http://www.metrokc.gov/health/glbt/hatecrime.htm",

Motive is used by police to establish intent, which is the true judge of criminality. Motive does not establish whether an action was a crime. In all honestly, it doesn't matter if Joe owed Carl money and Carl killed him for it, or if Joe was whistling a song that drove Carl nuts enough to kill him, or if Joe was gay and Carl killed him for it. All that matters is whether Carl killed Joe in determining if a crime was committed and what charge is levelled against Carl. \"Why\" doesn't and shouldn't change the crime he's charged with or the sentence given (by this I mean the sentence bounds shouldn't change).\n \n \n\n The thing is, without hate crime laws we see definite patterns, where some groups are attacked more than others.

But the number of lynchings also went down. I'm not trying to assert 100% cause and effect here, but things did get better after the laws were passed. This seems to indicate that laws of that sort are helpful, to a greater or lesser degree. That certainly is the opinion of the Supreme Court. Whatever resentment or ill will these laws might generate, and that point could use some expansion, the good they do seems to be greater.\n\n \n This example is a little too extreme to be analogous. Equal application of the law would demand that no one is lynched and all who lynch are charged with lynching. Equal application of the law does not demand different sentences for the same crime of lynching because of different reasons for lynching.\n \n \n\n How so? Equal application of the law, to my mind, means the same laws apply to everyone, right? Who don't these laws apply to? Anyone can break them, anyone can be the victim. \n\n \n Different punishment for the same crime is not punished equally. Ranking reasons for the same killing in some kind of priority list is unequal application of law.\n \n \n\n There's a footnote at the bottom. He made a half-hearted claim on 14th amendment grounds which I guess the court didn't feel were worthy of comment.\n\n \n As far as I know, the Court address all claims made in cases they accept... ah, well, I'm too lazy to look right now.",

   "Psychological damage, I have already stated that above. Do you not read the full post. \n \n\n So psychological damage can only happen to blacks, gays, etc.?\n \n \n\n Read this artilce:\n What is the difference between a hate crime and any other crime?\n \n \n What sets hate crimes apart from other acts of violence is the psychological damage that they leave behind. Although any type of victimization carries with it psychological consequences, certain types of emotional reactions are more frequent among survivors of hate crimes. These feelings include depression, anxiety, fear, stress and anger. The American Psychological Association has determined that victims of hate crimes suffer the symptoms of post-traumatic stress for up to five years, in comparison to two years for victims of non-bias-related crimes.\n \n\n What if someone is victimized because they have a funny name? What about for having long hair?\n \n \n\n Hate crime laws are laws that enhance the penalties imposed by the courts for individuals convicted of acts of bias-related violence. These laws, although controversial, are designed to act as a deterrent by punishing hate crime perpetrators more severely than those who commit similar types of violent acts that are not motivated by hatred. Forty-two states and the District of Columbia have laws against hate crimes. Of those, 21 include sexual orientation in categories protected. Washington State law protects victims of hate crimes based on sexual orientation.\n \n\n So we want to deter people from attacking blacks, gays, etc. but not other groups or not BECAUSE of the fact of their race, sexuality, etc.?\n \n \n\n Finally, survivors of hate crimes are less likely than victims of other types of violence to report attacks against them to the police. It has been estimated that up to 80% of bias-crimes are never reported to the authorities. There are many reasons for this. Minority groups, including GLBT communities, have historically had strained relations with law enforcement and fear that crimes against them will not be taken seriously or that the police reaction will be unsympathetic or hostile.\n \n\n In my opinion, this makes no difference. So since most don't report it, we punish the ones who do get reported for their crimes AND the crimes of those not reported? Most people speeding don't get caught. Why don't we impose a million dollar fine for speeding? That just doesn't make sense.\n \n \n\n In addition, survivors of anti-GLBT hate crimes may also be concerned that reporting attacks against them may expose them to increased risk by being \"outed\" to families and communities as a sexual minority. In many parts of the country (though not in King County, WA), individuals can be fired from jobs or evicted from their rental homes just for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. Many hate crime survivors suffer the trauma of victimization in silence rather than to expose themselves to these forms of \"secondary victimization.\" \n \n\n This makes no sense again. So because some may not report it we punish them more? Because the victim may be fired for admitting they are gay and reporting it we punish the criminal more? That just doesn't make sense.\n \n I pretty much agree with Sigma. If a crime is done with the intent to embarass someone or strike fear in them for who they are, it should be more severe anyway. There shouldn't be specific groups, hate crimes should apply for everyone who is attacked with the intent of striking fear because of who they are.",

If the judicial branch can take motive into account when determining sentences, then why can't the legislative?\n\n \n Because motive is not a consideration of whether or not an action is a crime. That is what the legislative branch does, defines what is or is not a crime. Legal definition: In criminal law, motive is distinguished from intent or mens rea. Although motive is not an element of a crime, evidence regarding motives can be introduced to help establish intent.

It's being used to determine how bad the crime is. The judicial branch does this, and you seem to be ok with it. The legislative branch must also determine how bad crimes are relative to each other, it's part of their job. Why can they not also take motive into account?

Much tension is created with the perceived difference in enforcement, especially in these issues. You have BET, but there would never be a \"white entertainment television\".

Combine this with the fact that hate crime laws would apply mostly when minorities are attacked and you will see perceived preferential treatment. This increases tension, which lead to more attacks, which lead to more retaliatory attacks. Applying the law across the board is the correct way without hate crime laws.\n \n \n\n \n This is bothering me.\n \n First of all, what does the existence of Black Entertainment Television, and not White Entertainment Television have to do with hate crimes laws?\n \n And secondly, please cite which black leaders are accusing 'anyone' and 'everyone' of being racist when defending another black person.",

   "tonybrown74,\n \n\n First of all, what does the existence of Black Entertainment Television, and not White Entertainment Television have to do with hate crimes laws?\n\n \n Please consider the context of what I said. The case cited by Kronus mentioned that a certain crime may increase racial tensions. I mentioned BET as perhaps another perpetrator of racial tension by its very existence (without a counterpart and the objections that I am sure would be raised about a counterpart). Since hate crime laws would undoubtedly apply more often when minorities are victims, these perceived inequalities only exacerbate racial tensions.\n \n \n\n And secondly, please cite which black leaders are accusing 'anyone' and 'everyone' of being racist when defending another black person.\n\n \n The case of Tookie Willaims (is that how you spell his name?) is a perfect example of this. He is the founder (or co-founder) of the Cripes gang and the murderer of at least 4 people (apparently because they were Chinese, which is of course worse than killing them to prove himself to the gang or randomly killing them or any other possible reason), with some other killings too if I remember correctly. He is on death row (or may have been executed by now, can't recall), and his lawyers were trying to get his death sentence commuted, and black leaders in the community were rallying behind him and calling all those who call for Tookie's death racist. Why? Because he is black. They don't say that, of course, but it would be foolish to believe they would rally behind a white man in a similar scenario. They even made Tookie King of the Kwanza celebration (I don't know if it is a Kwanza celebration or the Kwanza celebration; I don't know much about Kwanza). Talk radio DJs John and Ken on KFI were against his sentence being commuted, and many black leaders were calling them racists repeatedly on their program. I don't recall the names of the leaders, but \"racist\" was a favorite word of theirs and applied liberally to everyone from jurors to judges to guards to talk radio hosts to anyone who thought Tookie should die for his crimes. Examples such as these highlight and enflame racial tensions because of perceived inequality.\n \n Kronus,\n \n\n The legislative branch must also determine how bad crimes are relative to each other, it's part of their job. Why can they not also take motive into account? I repeat, motive has no bearing on the criminality of the act, it's used solely to determine how bad the crime is.\n\n \n You are separating two things that are not separate. The crime done, which has nothing to do with motive, determines the sentence given. Criminalizing motive or punishing motive (in cases where the sentence is extended because of motive) is certainly not part of their job. I'm not sure what you mean by \"determin[ing] how bad the crime is\", so I am not sure if I answered you. You are also misrepresenting what I have said. I am certainly not ok with the judge or jury changing the sentence bounds given, I am ok with the judge or jury working within the sentence bounds given.\n \n Are you asking what is preventing them from doing this thing? Besides fairness, equality, and the basis on which all of our laws stand, you mean? Nothing as far as I am aware of, though I am far from an expert on the subject. Nothing in the Constitution specifically prevents criminalizing or punishing motive, though I certainly believe a case can be made that it violates the spirit of Equal Protection, if not the letter. I had not thought of it this way before, but I see how it violates the First Amendment as well. However, who would be willing to be the philistine who stands up and asks Congress to repeal antidiscrimination and hate laws? They would be demonized the instant the words were out of his or her mouth, no matter if they are in the right. I also think they are cases of bad legislation, since they do not follow the basis of our laws as they have existed. That basis does not include punishing motives by legislation. Equal punishment for equal crime (and crime does not include motivation).\n \n It seems that you agree with me that motivation should not a crime make when the action taken is otherwise legal, yes?\n \n \n\n We do have stronger laws for that. They're called the anti-hate laws. They serve the exact same function as the anti-lynching laws, to discourage a specific form of violent/anti-social behavior by imposing stricter penalties. I don't see how you can be fine with one and opposed to the other.\n\n \n Because one punishes the motive, the other punishes the crime. I am content with punishing one crime stricter than another if we wish to discourage a specific crime more. I am not content with punishing one motive more than another through legislation. I believe it undermines our entire judicial system (why have sentence boundaries then?), and punishes viewpoints. That is not ok with me.\n \n \n\n A crime is not just action, it's also result. A shot fired randomly in the air that hits no one is a different crime than a random shot that kills somebody.\n\n \n As is a shot fired with the intent to hit someone a different crime, as is a shot fired with the intent to hit someone but hits someone else. There are many aspects considered when deciding what to charge a perp with (causality, liability, sanity, etc), but motive is not one of them and intent is the basis.\n \n \n\n Hate crimes have a greater impact than their generic counterparts, so they are treated differently than their generic counterparts. Is your objection simply that \"assault\" and \"casuing fear via assault\" have been glommed together into one charge?\n\n \n No, my objection is that the motive is a part of the charge. If you wish to make \"causing fear via assault\" a crime, be my guest and have my blessing. They should be separate charges, though, as \"grand theft auto\", \"assault with a deadly weapon\" and \"evading arrest\" are separate charges on an escaping criminal.\n \n \n\n Perhaps saying the purpose was often to cause fear was an overstatement. However, the result is often the generation of fear, beyond the actuall recipient of the violence. If you attack someone because they belong to a group, then you generate fear in that group. The social impact is greater, so the punishment is greater.\n\n \n Then make whatever social impact you object to a crime without involving the motivation of the criminal.

   "Sigma, looking at your last post, I'm seeing a trend. Motive. \n \n I don't know exactly how the laws were written, or what was in the legislature's mind. Clearly they wanted to stop a certain type of crime from happening. Based on the popular name, \"hate crime\", it's easy for us to assume that a particular motive is what they were trying to criminalize. You certainly seem to think that, and I was thinking that way myself at first. The more I read, though, the less I believe that. I don't believe that they were trying to criminalize hate, or even actions based on hate. Granted, the actions they criminalized often spring from hate. That's what we're most familiar with, and is doubtless where the name came from. What they actually were criminalizing, however, is actions that target groups. Not specific groups, but groups in general. They don't, for example, outlaw targeting jews, they outlaw targeting based on religion. It's not that you can't target blacks, it's that you can't target based on race. Most importantly, based on your objections, they don't specify the reasoning behind the targeting. We may assume it's hate, I know I did, but the laws don't say that. The laws say nothing about motive, just that it's worse to target groups. Based on the SC ruling, the reasoning is that targeting groups leads to increased fear among members of that group.\n \n It seems to me that if one looks at these laws from this light, it answers your objections. Motive is not, in fact, a factor. The law is applied equally to everyone. The law has a distinct purpose, and so should not be compared to similar laws which address attacks on individuals, rather than members of groups. What do you think?",

The law has a distinct purpose, and so should not be compared to similar laws which address attacks on individuals, rather than members of groups. What do you think?\n\n \n It would seem that if the law specifies the crime \"based on\" or \"because of\" race, religion etc that it is including motive, but if this is not the case I cannot object.\n \n This certainly has been an engaging debate and I have learned quite a bit. I must thank you :)",

I must thank you :)\n\n I'd also like to thank you for this debate. It's been educational. :)\n \n \n There are laws and definitions like this on the federal, state, and local level, and I can't answer for all of them. I'm sure some are better written than others. Some examples:\n \n Hate Crimes Statistics Act: crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, \n \n FBI: a criminal offense committed against a person, property or society which is motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender's bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity/national origin\n \n Massachusetts: Hate Crimes are defined as criminal acts which are motivated, in part or whole, by bias or bigotry directed at a victim due to that victim's race/ethnicity/national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or handicapped status.\n \n ADL: any crime committed because of the victim's actual or perceived race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, gender [male or female] or sexual orientation\n \n Some of these are better or worse, by your standard concerning motive. I put it to you, however, that some mention of motivation is required if the law is to work. The premise of these laws is that targetting groups is bad and to be discouraged. But how do you know if someone is attacked because they are part of a group or not? If I go out and beat up someone, you can't tell just from looking at the victim if I chose him just becuase he was the first person I came across, or becuase he was Jewish and my intent was to beat up Jews. You'ld have to look at what I said during the assault, or at any pattern from previous assaults. The only way to determine which crime I'm guilty of is to figure out my motivation. The crime is targeting groups, but the only practicle way to define the crime is to couch it in terms of motive. At least, that's the most practicle way that occurs to me. I'd be interested in any other wording you could come up with.\n \n Edit: Just wanted to expand on one point. Why someone is targeting groups doesn't matter, that part of the motive is irrelevant. The only aspect of motive that the laws touch on is if the attack was aimed at someone as an individual, or at someone as a member of a group. That seems like an important distinction.",

   "Steve,\n \n \n I had been listening to the case on occasion, but recently have not had my radio here at work so I have not kept up on it. It appears Arnold did not commute his sentence then :P\n \n tonybrown74,\n \n \n The existence of the program, not the content, is what I'm talking about. It is a perceived inequality that black people have a program exclusive to their entertainment, while there would most likely be objections and racial accusations were there a desire to make an exclusively white channel. This is repeated in many ways, mainly being that the exclusions of whites is deemed acceptable in instances where the reverse would not be socially acceptable. Whether this is real in anyway or merely perceived is up for debate. In this way, racial tensions are heightened because there is a perceived inequality. Add in that hate crime laws would apply more to minorities and it just adds to the tension. \n\n \n This makes no sense. BET does not exist to be exclusive entertainment for blacks. It is ethno-centric programming. And not very good at that (TV1 is better). For there to be a \"white\" channel, at least along the lines of what BET is aiming to do, there would have to be a single \"white\" culture, which there isn't. And BET does not exclude whites from its programming. \n \n Your statement seems flat out racist to me.\n \n \n \n \nWhether or not Tookie is guilty is irrelevant to our discussion.

   "\"white\" community, eh?\n\n \n It was your inital post that used the fact that the existence of BET without there being a White Entertainment Television that was causign resentment. The things is, I know why BET was created. It is due to the lack of african-american representation on television. It also gives news and entertainment that is geared towards blacks and issues surrounding blacks in America.\n \n \nI think you're missing the point, or I'm not explaining clearly enough. As Jyoshu said, my point is that it contributes to racial tension, not that the station is racist. You are also incorrect in stating that there would have to be a raciest feeling for there to be resentment because of real or perceived favoritism and inequality; those feelings are a byproduct of favoritism and inequality. \n \n \n I am not missing the point at all. \n \n As a black person in America, I've heard this kind of talk before. And I don't like where this is heading at all. \n \n \nAlso, if you read what I typed, it is not simply the existence of the channel, it is the fact that there would almost undoubtedly be outcries of racism if there were a similar channel created called \"Aryan Entertainment\" or \"White Central\" or some such.\n \n \n Aryan has a very negative conotation to it. However, if someone thinks they can make money by creating a channel devoted to Aryan issues, they should go for it. Just do not be surprised that none of satellite or cable providers would want to carry such obviously racist programming.\n \n \nThe inequality of allowing something such as BET while crying \"racism\" when a similar channel is created for white people is what contributes to racial tension. This is repeated in other ways, where something is acceptable for \"black\" people but it is socially unacceptable for white people. \n \n \n In America, there is an entire culture based solely on skin color. From food to music to dance to dialect. In a country where minorities, not just blacks, are have minimal, and sometimes negatively stereotypical representation in the media, some choose to create media that reflects more accurate, positive portayals of said community.\n \n For some to feel some sort of resentment based on the mere existence of media that was established based on the above criteria indicates, to me, that there are more sinister feelings involved by those who would take issue.\n \n \nI'll put it in as simple terms as I can: BET contributes to resentment towards \"black\" people. \n\n \n \nIt seems you are defending those leaders who cry racism at the drop of a hat.\n\n \n Actually I am not. What I am saying is that racism is more prevailant than you think.\n \n \n \nSo you are saying then that \"black\" entertainment is different than white entertainment?\n \n \n Not exactly. Entertainment may be seen differently by different audiences. And also there are times when certain audiences may want to view entertainment, news, documentaries, from a cultural perspective that identifies with them.\n \n \nWhat entertainment do \"blacks\" enjoy that needs to be separate from general programming? What or who are the general entertainment channels geared towards that a channel such as BET needs to exist?\n\n \n See above.\n \n \nWhat about your shared history of discrimination needs to be reflected in your TV program choices, and why should it be geared towards \"black\" people? There is no language barrier, and \"black\" people are a part of the culture of America, so I fail to see what a channel geared towards \"black\" people accomplishes.\n\n \n Really? \n \n When I moved to American in my early teens, my friends used to tell me about all the racism they experienced. But then I started to notice that all the experiences they were talking about were happening to me. It is that shared experience that contributes to a shared community identity. A lot of original hip-hop music (for example) addressed discrimination against blacks in this country. \"Soul Food\" is also something that we share as a community. Fashion, hairstyles, health issues, dance, and even art is something that we share as a community. \n \n If having a cable station (it's not even regular TV) that focuses on a culture that, coincidentally, has a physical identity (which occured through discrimination/racism) creates resentment amongst certain individuals, then there is a bigger race issue in America than people care to admit.\n \n \nI also find it amusing that I've been assigned a gender.\n\n \n Jyoshu was the one who insisted you were a she.",

Just as some of the lawsuits that came down on the side of gay rights exsposed the bigotry that already existed in a larger portion of society.\n\n \n I am not arguing that BET is the sole cause of racial tension or resentment, merely that it contributes to it.\n \n \n\n There is entertainment that appeals more to blacks than to others.\n\n \n The question was: is there entertainment that appeals more to whites than to blacks?\n \n \n\n That is changing BECAUSE of the existence of ethnocentric entertainment.\n\n \n No, that changes when such things are a part of mainstream entertainment.\n \n \n\n Back when MTV actually played music, they would not play hip-hop music (which was, back then, entirely an urban, black genre). When MTV finally started playing hip-hop, they played them in segments complete with black VJs in order to appeal to the hip-hop (read: black) audience. It is a testament to \"Yo MTV Raps\" that hip-hop has mass appeal NOW.\n\n \n Yay :) Seriously, this is the proper and right way for this to occur.\n \n \n\n Not solely, but they may have more relevence or meaning to one group more than others.\n\n \n Only if concentrations reside in a certain geographical area, but then the news is relevant to a certain geographical area and only incidentally relevant to a certain race. This does not support your point.\n \n \n\n Sometimes it's just representation. Othertimes it is programming that is geared towards breaking the stereotypes we see on mainstreem television. Health issues that affect blacks more than others, etc.\n\n \n Breaking down stereotypes should occur on mainstream television. There is programming about health issues for all races, that is not justification for a separate channel.\n \n \n\n Doesn't matter if it's a \"sub-culture\". It still exists. I can also argue that there is no such thing as \"Amrican culture\"; that it is a sub-culture in Western Culture.\n\n \n Skin color does not perform the same function that geography and gov't does. There is also no overarching society that American society is under. Similar values and common descent do not, by themselves, fulfill this role. Your comparison is flawed, I do not believe you can support the claim that these two situations are analogous. This sub-culture formed within, because of and in response to American culture. \n \n \n\n It is both. Issues regarding race affect culture, and not just in the U.S.\n\n \n Any culture you wish to represent has channels for that purpose. The only reason it is on one channel is because of race. BET is racially motivated.\n \n \n\n BET separates no one from anything. Whites (or any other race for that matter) can watch or not watch BET. It is not a mandate for blacks to watch BET. I watch very little BET.\n\n \n This matters little. Trying to represent black \"culture\" on one channel withdrawals it from mainstream programming (in practice, at least). This separates blacks from the rest of society, for while other races integrate themselves and become a part of the programming (with the exception of channels that cater to a different language), black people insist on having separate programming.\n \n \n\n Racial tensions existed before BET. They will exist after.\n Will they exist forever? I hope not. But it is obvious that they exist now. \n \n\n \n I agree with all of these statements.",

   "This does not address what I said.\n\n \n I was setting a premise for the existence of BET.\n \n \nNeither would black people or any other race be prevented on \"Aryan Entertainment\" necessarily. This issue with what I said is the double standard with the perception. You see \"Aryan Entertainment\" as raciest, yet do not see how \"Black Entertainment Television\" could possibly contribute to racial tension.\n\n \n The problem is, the double standard existed because of the lack of entertainment that was representative of minorites. Hence the advent of BET. One of the best examples I can give you is Friends. Here is a comedy set in New York, a city where minorities outnumber the majority (in this country), and yet there was a serious lack of people of color even in the coffee shop that they used to hang out in. BET exists just to show more positive (in some ways) portrayals of people of color on television. And yes, they do focus on issues that more blacks/people of color relate to.\n \n From www.m-w.com:\n \n \nMain Entry: 1Ary\u00b7an \n Pronunciation: 'ar-E-&n, 'er-; '\u00e4r-y&n\n Function: adjective\n Etymology: Sanskrit Arya noble, belonging to the people speaking an Indo-European dialect who migrated into northern India\n 1 : INDO-EUROPEAN\n 2 a : of or relating to a hypothetical ethnic type illustrated by or descended from early speakers of Indo-European languages b : NORDIC c -- used in Nazism to designate a supposed master race of non-Jewish Caucasians having especially Nordic features3 : of or relating to Indo-Iranian or its speakers \n\n \n Definition #2 is why I would have an issue with an Aryan Entertainment channel. Can I prevent it from happening? No. Will I watch it? Obviously not.\n \n \nNever did I say this. You said [BET was created] due to the lack of african-american representation on television.\n\n \n Yes.\n \n \nInstead of working to change representation, black people have, in essence, run off to play by themselves. Of course, they still demand representation but now they've lost, imo, the moral grounds for that demand. It also generates resentment because black people have a channel for their representation, making those demands a tad unreasonable.\n\n \n Black peopel did not \"run off to play by themselves.\" After lots of complaining, someone decided that, rather than wait for someone to finally address our concerns, he will create a channel that fills in that missing void.\n \n \nIndirectly it is. There's no reason to include them into mainstream programming since black people have their own channel for such things.\n\n \n Actually, I would argue that you are wrong here. The success of BET has shown that programming geared towards african americans is extremely popular. As a matter of fact, there are some stations (ABC and UPN; it's a start) have shows now that are geared to african americans and latinos. This may not have occured without the existence of BET.\n \n \nI am not arguing that BET is the sole cause of racial tension or resentment, merely that it contributes to it.\n\n \n It is not a cause for tension at all. The only people that would have issue wth the existence of BET would have had issue with any positive portrayals of minorities on tv.\n \n \nThe question was: is there entertainment that appeals more to whites than to blacks?\n\n \n I know very few blacks that got Seinfeld. I know I didn't. Most of my white friends loved it, though. Suprisingly, I do not feel any resentment towards them. \n \n \nNo, that changes when such things are a part of mainstream entertainment.\n\n \n And that would not have happen without the success of BET.\n \n \nYay :) Seriously, this is the proper and right way for this to occur.\n\n \n I think this proved my point. They played Hip-Hop music in blocks with black VJsin blocks for hours. How is that much different from having an entire station geared towards blacks?\n \n \nOnly if concentrations reside in a certain geographical area, but then the news is relevant to a certain geographical area and only incidentally relevant to a certain race. This does not support your point.\n\n \n \nBreaking down stereotypes should occur on mainstream television. There is programming about health issues for all races, that is not justification for a separate channel.\n\n \n Should, but not only. Why should it matter where it occurs, as long as it does?\n \n \nSkin color does not perform the same function that geography and gov't does. \n \n \n Never said it does. It still does not explain why there is a sub-culture that exists around skin color.\n \n \nThere is also no overarching society that American society is under. Similar values and common descent do not, by themselves, fulfill this role. Your comparison is flawed, I do not believe you can support the claim that these two situations are analogous. \n \n \n The reality is that there is no one American culture. American \"culture\" is pretty much a collection of different cultures.\n \n \nThis sub-culture formed within, because of and in response to American culture. \n\n \n It formed because of two things: slavery, and the apartheid that came after slavery was abolished.\n \n \nAny culture you wish to represent has channels for that purpose. The only reason it is on one channel is because of race. BET is racially motivated.\n\n \n Didn't say that it wasn't. But there is a culture that is based on race, particularly when it comes to blacks.\n \n \n \nThis matters little. Trying to represent black \"culture\" on one channel withdrawals it from mainstream programming (in practice, at least). \n \n \n It didn't exist in the first place. Creating a station that is very popular based on black culture showed that black culture was popular.\n \n \nThis separates blacks from the rest of society, for while other races integrate themselves and become a part of the programming (with the exception of channels that cater to a different language), black people insist on having separate programming.\n\n \n No. Jim Crow, redlining and absence of programs that addressed poverty, health and education, coupled with such nefarious tactics, like the Tuskegee experiment (which caused many blacks to distrust government), caused blacks to separate themselves from the rest of society.",

Blacks have BET, whites can't have WET, therefore whites resent blacks for getting something that they can't have, and racial tension ensues.\n \n (That's what I call spelling out one's reasoning, by the way)\n \n That reasoning is flawed for several reasons. The foremost is the fact that most TV is WET already. Whites can see themselves on TV all the time, and most prime time TV is aimed at a white audience. Blacks get nothing from BET that whites don't get from most of the rest of TV. There's nothing to resent.\n \n Your use of \"racially motivated\" is also flawed. BET is designed to appeal to a specific race, and thus could be called \"racially motivated\". If someone started the \"Aryan network\", you could correctly call that racially motivated as well, but in a very different way.

I can agree with you though that BET was created out of the vacuum of entertainment geared toward blacks, at the time. (Although realistically, a lot of it was marketing to a niche for profit; we mustn't forget that entertainment is an industry.) But the question still remains, given that black representation is much more on par with whites in the entertainment industry, of whether a network like BET is or is not counter-productive to it's original intent. I can see Sigma's point that if one's goal is to have or maintain representation in mainstream programming, that creating seperate programming might, to  some degree undermine that. \n \n Also, what is it, exactly, that makes it ok to have a channel/sitcom/movie/what-ever-else for one group and not for another? The hypothetical of the \"white channel\" keeps coming up. Why the double standard that it would be racist and the black channel not? That's not an accusation that the black channel is racist. But what's the difference? Is it because one is a minority? Is it because one has a supposed definite (yet undefined) \"culture\"? Is it because one groups has mistreated the other at some point in history? What rational reason (not emotional) is there to assume that a \"straight pride\" event, a WET network, or a \"straight channel\" can only be an example of bigotry? What rational reason is there that one can be celebrated and not the other? I'm not arguing for the creation of anything here. I just don't see why there should automatically be a double-standard without reasons. And if it's that obvious, the there should be some very rational reasons.\n \n I also find it interesting that we're even talking in veiled terms of quotas here, begging the question of whether entertainment should be based on \"representation\" in the first place. These are essentially the same arguments, pro and con, that are made over affirmative action.",

   "\n You're trying to state that whites resent BET.\n\n \n Sort of, but not really. BET is the cause of the resentment (in the microcosm we are speaking of), but not the focus of the resentment. If I'm eating cake and you want some cake too but I say you shouldn't have any, the cake is the cause but not the focus of the resentment. My attitude is the focus. The issue we're arguing is much more complex, but hopefully that analogy helps you understand this portion.\n \n \n\n Blacks have BET, whites can't have WET, therefore whites resent blacks for getting something that they can't have, and racial tension ensues.\n\n \n No. Whether whites can have WET is irrelevant. The racial tension is caused by the attitude that whites shouldn't get a channel, for whatever reason. BET by itself does nothing, it's the very real feeling that black people would rant and rave and level racism charges against anyone and everyone at the creation of WET that causes tension.\n \n \n\n That reasoning is flawed for several reasons. The foremost is the fact that most TV is WET already. Whites can see themselves on TV all the time, and most prime time TV is aimed at a white audience.\n\n \n This means...? That there is no market for WET? That WET shouldn't be allowed to exist, should there be a market for it?\n \n Mainstream programming is geared towards as large an audience as possible. Networks want ratings, and if that comes with programming that mostly show white people that is what they are going to do.\n \n \n\n Blacks get nothing from BET that whites don't get from most of the rest of TV. There's nothing to resent.\n\n \n I disagree, and you see my reason above.\n \n \n\n Your use of \"racially motivated\" is also flawed. BET is designed to appeal to a specific race, and thus could be called \"racially motivated\". If someone started the \"Aryan network\", you could correctly call that racially motivated as well, but in a very different way. That's just racism, in the \"down with blacks\" sense, and so has no relationship to the \"racial motivation\" beh9ind BET.\n\n \n This is a great example of my point. \n \n I am very certain that white people would resent the implication that programming geared towards white people to the exclusion of other races is automatically racist, while programming geared towards black people to the exclusion of other races is not. BET does exclude other races, because every time slot used for a black issue is one less for any other race.\n \n This attitude causes racial tension, and it is prevalent in our society, imo.\n \n \n\n The problem isn't my density. It's the fact that you're making assumptions that I'm not, and you won't tell me what they are. For every sentence you post you seem to have 5 sentences of assumption that you aren't sharing. Please, stop posting these one sentence snippets and then getting snippy when I don't fill in the blanks.\n\n \n I don't like being manipulated. Your density was artifice, and I don't dance to anyone's tune but my own. You knew the answer, and I knew you knew.\n \n \n\n And the answer, which you still failed to provide, is \"whites\".\n\n \n Generally speaking, probably so. Not all white people will care, and some other peoples may believe there is merit to a WET channel. Similarly, not all black people would protest, and other peoples might protest as well.\n \n \n\n No, that's what you say. And of course the sole purpose of WET would be to be exclusionary. Most TV is already \"white friendly\", we don't need another station to fill in that gap. \n\n \n \"Need\" is generally irrelevant to my point. Content is generally irrelevant to my point. Motive is generally irrelevant to my point, besides the desire to cater to a specific race. Need has little to do with the creation of additional channels. It's what we have a market for.\n \n \n\n No, it's the key to the discussion. Like you said, everyone wants to see people they can relate to on TV. Whites get that in spades, blacks didn't. That's why BET came about. It fills a market gap.\n\n \n You, and most black people I think, refuse to believe there could be a market for WET that doesn't involve racism. That implication and belief can very well cause racial tension. That implication and belief are prevalent in our society, imo.",

   "\n The problem is, the double standard existed because of the lack of entertainment that was representative of minorites. Hence the advent of BET. One of the best examples I can give you is Friends. Here is a comedy set in New York, a city where minorities outnumber the majority (in this country), and yet there was a serious lack of people of color even in the coffee shop that they used to hang out in.\n\n \n And? Would black people object to such things?\n \n \n\n BET exists just to show more positive (in some ways) portrayals of people of color on television. And yes, they do focus on issues that more blacks/people of color relate to.\n\n \n That's fine, but then don't complain about their lack on mainstream TV :-\\ \n \n \n\n Definition #2 is why I would have an issue with an Aryan Entertainment channel.

Yet you dismiss my concern about the connotations of \"Black Entertainment Television\". Double standard.\n \n \n\n Actually, I would argue that you are wrong here. The success of BET has shown that programming geared towards african americans is extremely popular. As a matter of fact, there are some stations (ABC and UPN; it's a start) have shows now that are geared to african americans and latinos. This may not have occured without the existence of BET.\n\n \n And yet you yourself do not watch it :P\n \n This is a good argument for the existence of BET, but doesn't address my point. Any social change or integration happens in mainstream programming, as you yourself know and continually point out. Maintaining your own separate programming will not do that.\n \n I'll rephrase what I said: There is no reason to heed demands of black leaders for equal representation, since black people have their own programming. I would be sympathetic to such a desire without the existence of a channel such as BET, but with that channel general programming is free to choose based on what they believe their audience wants.\n \n \n\n I know very few blacks that got Seinfeld.

What it's doing is allowing there to be black programming at all. If it weren't for BET there would be little to no programming aimed towards blacks.\n\n \n If there is a market, there will be programming. However, the market is with BET, so there would be little programming. I'm not sure that there is only a little programming aimed at black people anymore, however. From what I've seen of upcoming shows they seem pretty diverse. I watch little TV, however.\n \n \n\n And BET isn't exclusive, there's no \"No Whites\" sign anywhere. It's just programming marketed towards blacks. That's all.\n\n \n It's marketed towards blacks. Every timeslot that goes to black issues is one less timeslot for other races. This is what I mean by exclusive. It's not marketed towards white people, so there is little programming that is directed to white people. They do deliberately exclude other races, because they are marketing to one races.",

Now, would this happen on a Aryan sponsored television station? Now, \"your pulling teeth when it's not necessary.\" A lot of blacks don't live like the people on \"Full House\"(I watched that show every friday!) or one of the other shows which featured white casts. The lifetime channel is aimed at women audiences. I'm assuming you have beef with that too, right? Also, not all blacks think the same. I for one would rather have a progressive white person on the supreme court than an individual such as Clarence Thomas. I don't think it makes sense to beef about the Hispanic Television stations either because, both whites and blacks out number them on television. I feel really bad for the Asians. Gays are also underrepresented on television and we need more roles. Most straight people are not comfortable with gay people. Therefore, we form a gay television station. Now, it's similiar to BET.

   "And? Would black people object to such things? \n\n \n It's a popular show set in NY. And yet there weren't any blacks, asains or latinos in the background. Even we minorities realize that actors need to work, and there were no actors of color represented on the show.\n \n \nThat's fine, but then don't complain about their lack on mainstream TV :-\\ \n\n \n I wasn't the one complaining. I didn't start this line of discussion, remember?\n \n \nI'm sorry, you have an issue with an \"Aryan Entertainment\" channel because of the name regardless of the content? The definition you posted had 1 other entry and 2 other sub-entries in the entry you object to. Whether you can prevent it is irrelevant. You would object to it, based on the name. Yet you dismiss my concern about the connotations of \"Black Entertainment Television\". Double standard.\n\n \n I admit to it freely. Its creation would be, at the very least, suspect IMO. But I would not resent white people because I have an issue with the channel.\n \n \nAnd yet you yourself do not watch it :P\n\n \n No, not really. Not anymore. But I know why it was created.\n \n \nThis is a good argument for the existence of BET, but doesn't address my point. Any social change or integration happens in mainstream programming, as you yourself know and continually point out. Maintaining your own separate programming will not do that.\n\n \n And there has been more integration, due to the existence of BET. Its popularity shows that there is money to be made in \"black\" entertainment. And the people who own the networks obviously see profits in it.\n \n \nI'll rephrase what I said: There is no reason to heed demands of black leaders for equal representation, since black people have their own programming. I would be sympathetic to such a desire without the existence of a channel such as BET, but with that channel general programming is free to choose based on what they believe their audience wants.\n\n \n I don't agree. And with satellite/cable becoming even more popular, network TV is going to have to find a way to become more integrated to survive.\n \n \nThen perhaps there is a reason for a channel geared towards white entertainment.\n \n \n If you think so, then I say go ahead. I will not stop you.\n \n \nThat's an assumption without proof. \n\n \n So is your statement about resentment.\n \n \nI think it helps my point more than yours. Having a program geared towards blacks in mainstream programming is what I have been arguing for. I am against having a channel for this purpose because I believe it undermines the effort of integration into everyday society.\n\n \n I disagree. At the time, I remember all my friends would come home to watch the \"black\" shows. When it ended, we all switched to something else or turned off the tv and went outside. I can't speak for what whites or others did. \n \n \nIt's a philosophical point. I believe it is more beneficial to the goal of integration if black programming is more mainstream. I believe it is counterproductive if it is separated.\n\n \n We're not talking about integration. We are talking about representation, and creating a station geared to wards blacks addressed representation.\n \n \nI'm not trying to explain why. There is one American culture, which is a collection of different cultures. Culture can change.\n\n \n Indeed. But why deny the existence of black culture?",
