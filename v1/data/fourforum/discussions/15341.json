Currently in the U.S. they can't teach religion in schools but this doesn't stop Parents from teaching religion at home. Kids who are taught to blindly follow an invisible man in the sky do not learn how to think for themselves, rather they think through a Bible. Religion promotes War, Murder, Genocide, and suppresses free thinking. Religious children are taught that Science is bad, that it goes against the teachings of their religion so as a species because of religion we are becoming dumber as time moves forward. A scientist in stem cell research would not be as effective if he/she were saddled with the doctrine of religion. Hawking realizes this as well as many very influential scientists so speaking out against religion is their way of trying to open the eyes of the blind so that we can advance as a species.",

   "Hawking is actually a brilliant scientist, his early discoveries about black holes put him up there with the greats. He's not Einstein or Newton, but he's certainly on a par with Hubble: a gifted scientist who made substantial advances in our understanding of the universe.\n \n He's certainly more famous because of his illness, but I think that's more do with people's need for a archetypal scientist in every generation, ideally one who is eccentric and in some way weird. People like their scientists to take the place of mystics of an earlier time - Hawking with his strange voice, fixed expression and gnomic turn of phrase fits the bill rather nicely.\n \n @Xcaliber. I think you're projecting your own opinions onto Hawking. Your characterisation of religion is an absurd caricature and is barely true of the lunatic fringe of religion, never mind the majority of believers.

If religious people lived what they preach it might be different.. Jesus himself said he did not come to spread peace, God murdered thousands upon thousands of his own creations, According to the Bible. Every Single religious person on this planet is a hypocrite, not a single one does exactly as the Supposed word of God tells them to do. Churches protesting a gay soldiers funeral is NOT christian or Jesus like behavior. Blowing up an abortion clinic and killing abortion doctors is NOT christian behavior. Each religious person interprets the \"Word of God\" in their own way. Wars have been fought over religion. Today, in the 21st century we have Muslims killing Christians, Christians Killing anybody that doesn't think their way, Jews killing Muslims, and the list goes on, All in the name of a \"GOD\" that not one religion can prove to exist. We have Politicians using religion to drive their political agenda and in the process destroying us as a species . Most religious zealots, especially Christians think they can do what they want, when they want and they use the Bible and God as Justification to spread hate, Racism, Homophobia, Murder, And all the atrocities that humans commit against one another because the religions have a built in loophole, a default to get away with anything. \" Repent and your sins are forgiven. \n So when I claim religion is dangerous to humans as a species it's definitely not out of character for religion . I stated in my reply above that \" I THINK\" which is me voicing my opinion. I didn't project my personal feelings onto Hawking or anyone else, just merely made an observation. Religion is Dangerous, plain and simple. If most religious people would actually read their own Bible instead of cherry picking only the good parts then more eyes would open to the truth. \n \n but that's just my opinion.. and a few well known scientists might agree .",
