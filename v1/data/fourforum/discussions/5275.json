   "It is probably not known by many but European economies are building a bigger trade deficit (rate of increase) with China than is the U.S. Italy is the hardest hit. Look for this to be a very big political issue in Europe in coming months and years. \n =========================\n \n Treasury Dept. Warns China on Currency\n \n By JEANNINE AVERSA, AP Economics Writer1 hour, 40 minutes ago\n \n The Bush administration, in its hardest stance yet, warned China on Tuesday that it likely will be accused of manipulating its currency to gain an unfair trade advantage over the United States - unless Beijing acts swiftly to overhaul its currency system.\n \n The administration has been prodding China in earnest over the last two years to stop linking its currency, the yuan, to the U.S. dollar. Manufacturers and other critics, including Democratic and Republican lawmakers in Congress, contend that China's currency system puts U.S. companies at a big competitive disadvantage and has contributed to the loss of U.S. factory jobs.\n \n The Treasury Department issued the warning as part of its twice-a-year report to Congress. However, it stopped short of finding that China - or any other major trading partner of the United States - was engaging in unfair currency practices.\n \n But the administration clearly stepped up the pressure on China, saying it could be branded a manipulator of currency if the country doesn't switch soon to a flexible exchange system - something advocated not only by the United States but also by other economic powers.\n \n A 1988 law requires the department to analyze countries' exchange rate policies and determine whether manipulation to gain unfair trade advantages is occurring. The law has economic sanctions that can be imposed on countries found in violation.\n \n \"If current trends continue without substantial alteration, China's policies will likely meet the statute's technical requirements for designation\" of currency manipulation, the Treasury Department's report said.\n \n American manufacturers say this system has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40 percent...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050517/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/us_china_currency_6",

Even taking your hypothetical assertion that ONLY 9% of our economy is of the underground economy that adds another 1 Trillion to our economy so we are at $12 Trillion. That is to say even a smaller amount of % applied to a larger number is oftentimes more meaningful than applying a larger % to a smaller number. (i.e.100% of nothing is still nothing.) But I believe it (our underground economy) to be considerably larger than that but it is not all that important. \n \n It is a fact that the U.S. economy grew at about a 4.4% increase in 2004 while Europe's economy grew at about 2.4% in 2004. The % of debt to GDP varies considerably and I'll just list them from 2004 bearing in mind that our economy is still growing much more than is Europe and in fact is pulling away even faster.

So long as a dynamic economy can service its debt there is very little to be concerned about. Not to say that is shouldn't be attended to but contrary to those who look at economies as some kind of static environment the national debts do not matter all that much. The proof of this can be seen in the fact at of the above nations listed above, Japan is currently undergoing an economic revival. We're doing at 4% or above.

   "This pretty much sums up the reality of our national debt situation.\n -------------------------------------------\n \n Myths vs. Realties for the United States National Debt\n \n Myth #1: The National Debt will cause the United States to go bankrupt\n \n Reality: The U.S. is not like you or me. The U.S. government has the power to tax the largest economy in the world, the power to print money and has an infinite life expectancy. All of these factors mean the federal government can incur large amounts of debt.\n \n Myth #2: We have to pay back all of the $5.6 trillion in debt (has increased since this was written but so has our GDP.)\n \n Reality: The U.S. can simply \"roll over\" its debt year after year. That is, the Treasury Dept. issues new bonds to pay off the old ones. This is not a problem as long as investors are willing to hold U.S. Treasury bonds. U.S. Treasury bonds are very popular due to their liquidity (they are easily converted to cash), their low risk (they have zero default risk because they are backed by \"the full faith and credit\" of the U.S. government), and certain tax advantages.\n \n Myth #3: The interest payments on the national debt are a burden to future generations.\n \n Reality: U.S. citizens or even agencies of the U.S. government own most of the debt. Thus we are just paying interest to ourselves.\n \n Myth #4: Foreign ownership of the debt causes money to flow out of the U.S.\n \n Reality: Foreign interests own only about 15% of the debt, and this proportion has remained virtually unchanged since 1980. They typically reinvest their interest payments in the U.S.\n \n Myth #5: The national debt is out of control.\n \n Reality: The true measure of the debt of a nation is the ratio of that debt to the size of the economy. The debt-to-GDP ratio for the U.S. is relatively modest compared (1) to other nations and (2) historically.\n \n \n There are, however two potential problems with our national debt:\n \n 1. The interest payments on the debt redistribute income from taxpayers to bondholders. This redistribution is potentially regressive since wealthier households hold Treasury bonds. So all taxpayers pay debt interest but mostly wealthier taxpayers receive that interest. However, higher income households also bear a larger tax burden than low- and middle-income households: In 1999 the top 1% of household in terms of income paid over 30% of all income taxes.\n \n 2. Large debts may produce the crowding out effect. Large debt levels by the U.S. government increase the demand for loanable funds, which increases interest rates and reduces the amount of private borrowing for investment spending. The size of this effect is a subject of debate among economists.\n \n http://www.oswego.edu/~edunne/debtmyths.html",

   "A very poor use of credit, encouraged by the US government at public and personal levels with no value added to drive GDP with internal transactions in an attempt to offset gross payment imbalance to display positive growth numbers. A losing game, badly played.\n \n It would be interesting to interview some of those consumers supporting a push to unpeg the Yuan 'to make the US more competitive' when that does occur. I guess if they do believe that's possible, for USD to stay on a par with a currency backed by no debt, a positive payment balance and growing economy and that US GDP is growing after subtracting SS theft, debt and supplemental war costs, I could probably sell them designer label wheelbarrows to carry their pocket change.\n\n \n There seems to be a push on here to disparage the U.S. economy by referring to our debt as the engine that pushes the economy forward. Someone posted an absurd figure of $46,000 debt for each American which to anyone with common sense knows is not possible to service such debt. Our stock market is as of this writing up another 75 points. Just casual observation shows that our economy is doing very well. We are over 4% growth and Europe is barely into positive territory but we are supposed to be into self-flaggellation. Here is the reality of China as opposed to the silliness about our economy. It should be obvious why China is so against unpegging the Yuan. This explains why.\n =====================================\n Chinese economy heading for a recession?\n \n Peter Zhang\n BrookesNews.Com\n Monday16 May 2005\n \n When Zhu Rongji, was China's Premier he promised to put the state sector on a sound economic footing. He failed dismally. President Jiang Zhemin also struggled with the problem. He too failed. Now President Hu Jintao is faced with the problem and it looks like it might be coming to a head.\n \n These so-called state enterprises are economic black holes that are sucking in the nation's savings. They are overmanned, suffer appalling productivity, swimming in oceans of red ink (despite heroic efforts at cooking the books), producing shoddy goods and building up astronomical debts. This is a fair description of the state sector.\n \n Notwithstanding massive sacking and huge injections of scarce capital, these malinvestments exist in a zombie-like state, creating a gigantic drag on the rest of the economy. But that's only a part of China's economic woes.\n \n There are reports that the ranks of the unemployed and underemployed are rapidly. I should like to make it clear that this is not strictly true. There was always massive unemployment under communism, only overmanning was used to hide it.\n \n Now that the burden of overmanning is no longer possible on the same scale, the country is once again witnessing in the emergence of swelling unemployment as part of Mao's atrocious socialist legacy that still burdens the country\n \n Another problem is that China's banks are broke. They are literally bankrupt. The banks, on instructions from the state, made colossal loans to the state sector even though they knew they would never be repaid. (I'll still bank in Hong Kong but not on the mainland). It is no wonder their non-performing loans have been reported at over 50 per cent of GDP.\n \n The only thing that's keeping this jerry-built structure afloat is funny money policies. Monetary growth has been enormous over the last few years. However, as part of an effort to slowdown credit expansion the central bank recently raised the banks' reserve ratio. Since January there has been a significant reduction in monetary growth. Unless monetary policy is reversed, it looks like the Chinese economy will go into recession\n \n Another problem facing China is the sheer scale of corruption. Party officials have ripped the financial guts out state firms, literally pocketing billions of dollars earmarked for investment and subsidies.\n \n That these funds would have been wasted anyway is no excuse for these party vultures to stick them in their personal Swiss bank accounts. The Chinese people have suffered a great deal and they certainly deserve something better than senile generals, venal officials and thieving party cadres.\n \n China has a wealth of entrepreneurial talent and a people noted for their diligence, respect for learning and a high savings rate. Allow these virtues total freedom and I believe China's progress would astonish the world. But before this can come to pass it looks like the Chinese economy and the political system might have to go through the wringer once again - more's the pity. \n \n \n http://www.brookesnews.com/051605Zhang_print.html",

A lot of the electronics I have are made in China. People will tend to buy what is the best quality at the lowest price. The problem with China is that its currency is not based on market conditions. The Chinese government knows that if they have a downturn in exports that this will inevitably affect their employment. I suppose they could put most of their citizens on the dole with their foreign money reserves but that wouldn't last forever. Their banking system is broke. Their government is fighting a holding action against the tide of history. I have this nagging fear that they might in the end galvanize their population by creating foreign enemies and that might be us. I'd watch the China problem very closely.

The facts are on my side. \n \n I've been reading for nearly four years on the internet the following two views. 1) The U.S. is going down as a superpower -- we are doomed, yada, yada, yada. 2) The U.S. currency is going down, down, down and we will be bankrupt and everyone in the soup lines, yada, yada, yada.\n \n None of this will happen. We have a dynamic, growing economy with a non-socialist government as exists in most of Europe. The weight of evidence is that the market economy will in time correct most all of our ills. This is not to say that we are perfect. I would suggest three areas that we need to work on immediately. 1) Our high and unsustainable medical care costs (not our medical care but the costs.) 2) Our U.S. Congress; namely the House of Representatives, that is no longer answerable to the American voter because of gerrymandering. 3) Special interest money that distorts the political system. \n \n These three areas need remedial action.

Public and personal spending facilitated by debt now accounts for over 80% of US GDP, for all practical purposes making us a service economy in a debtor nation.

Several opiners here would have us believe Americans as a group are one foot on a bannana peel and the other in the bankruptcy court. Your example is one that goes to the heart of the GDP/National Debt argument. So long as our economy grows and our percentage doesn't significantly increase and perhaps even declines we will be fine. On a smaller level, a person making $30,000 a year income might be overburdened with a $18,000 debt (other than his mortgage) while a person making $300,000 a year would consider $18,000 debt as chump change. Businesses constanly leverage their income through issuing stocks and bonds to meet their growing needs. It is both necessary and wise if done properly. On the other other hand, a General Motors, although still ripe with cash is in a world of hurt because its business is not growing. A smaller business with a greater debt as a percentage of its revenue might be perfectly all right if the upglide is promising. That's why I do my own quarterly \"liquid net worth\" to see exactly how we are faring. But I have looked at other portfolios and could only shake my head in amazement at the junk debts and largely worthless assets. In one instance I had to counsel bankruptcy it was so hopeless.
