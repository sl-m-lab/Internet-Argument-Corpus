A level-headed, straightforward reply that (hopefully) inspires level-headed debate.\n \n \nI imagine almost everyone would trust themselves with a gun.\n\n \n I imagine the same. I imagine anyone asked \"are you attractive\" would also respond in the affirmative because it is also a subjective question open to the interpretation of the respondant. I don't believe that anyone who thinks they should have a gun should be just instantly qualified to buy a gun on the recognizance of their own feelings of responsibility. But, unlike a \"qualification\" for attractiveness, there ARE factors set in place to determine qualification to have a firearm. There are the wonderful Brady background checks (NICS), qualification requirements for training (for CCW), laws against felons to possess, FBI background checks (for purchse through the ATF and the requisite 4473) Interpol background checks (for CCW) and a plethora of local, state, and Federal laws pertaining to the posession of firearms. \n \n Therefore, since I FEEL qualified, and the government itself says I'm qualified, and there's this thing called the 2nd Amendment that says I have the right if I'm qualified (pending the above qualifications), I safely and responsibly DO carry a firearm. (Just like the police who safely do so).\n \n Whereas, I feel it is unfair (I know...BOO-HOO! for me) that someone else should feel the need to determine my level of responsibility based upon the feelings of THEIR OWN. \n \n I was basicly getting to the point that, if anti-gunners were basing their desire to disarm me through the filter of their own feelings of inadequacy, it is...well...BS. Their subjective opinion of THEMSELVES has nothing to do with my actual qualifications. So if they feel irresponsible, they are just painting others with the \"broad brush\" of their own image.\n \n Yet, if they (such as yourself) feel perfectly safe and responsible in the handling of a dangerous object, wouldn't it be hypocritical to say you are the only one and we \"gun nuts\" are not? (I'm not calling you a hypocrite, just pointing out the difference between your feelings for your own responsibility and the possible assumption that others are less so.)\n \n As for the exaggerated question: Yes. Although exaggerated, it is still a rellevant question. Similar to those unfamiliar with firearms, if I suddenly \"found one\" in my yard, I shouldn't be allowed to tinker with the thing. I would be unfamiliar with a nuke, therefore unqualified to be trusted with its posession. Yet, if I went through the proper training, knew how to transport it, work on it, and had the means to keep it secure, I would have no problem digging out the Turtle Wax and polishing the thing to a high glossy sheen. Similar to firearms, if I knew my neighbor, the mailman, or even you, iangb, had the proper training and were a responsible enough person, I'd let you park it in your driveway if you could show me you've passed an FBI, Interpol, and the wonderful Brady NICS checks.",

I believe every humans possess the ability to to do so, but not nessesarily through the involvement of firearms.\n Although i must reiterate the words \"responsibility, dangerous and trustworthy\" are entire being of a subjective, circumstantial situation.\n \n \nSince you believe OTHERS should not have guns, it limits you on how you reach this determination for YOURSELF.\n\n \n I do not believe OTHERS should not have guns, I think criminals and psychos who are yet to convict a gun crime should not have guns.\n This does limit my opinion on gun owners since i cannot, nor can any regimented system indicate and predict who these intended criminals will be.

   "At last! A level-headed, straightforward reply that (hopefully) inspires level-headed debate.\nI do my best emoticon_rolleyes.\n \n I realise that there are already some 'qualifications' that one needs in order to possess a firearm, but some of these vary from state to state (for example, last time I looked there were only ~10 states that required training and/or testing for gun ownership, and most (if not all) of those were only training/testing for a CCW license, not for owning the gun itself. \n \n I guess it would be fair to call these required qualifications the 'opinion' of the US government, yes? The extra measures I have proposed (chiefly a valid reason (non-self-defence) for owning a gun) is not just my 'opinion', but the opinion of the UK government, also. In fact, the UK government is stricter than what I am proposing. This isn't hugely relevant (as the whole thing is an appeal to (lack of) authority anyway), but I thought I'd clarify that I'm not alone in my opinions. I'd still say that if I can justify my opinions, though, it doesn't matter who disagrees unless their collective justification is better than mine.\n \n I don't think that 'gun nuts' shouldn't be trusted with guns - I think that (almost) all people can be trusted with guns, for a given value of 'trust'. However (and this is the important bit), I don't base 'trust' on my opinion of myself, or on my opinion of specific others. This is the reason that your question/argument falls apart, because I am neither 'broad brushing' my personality onto others, nor am I being hypocritical by comparing my personality with others - my position rests almost entirely on statistical data - which shows that guns are hugely misused, wherever they are owned, regardless of my own opinions about myself. It's that more impartial data upon which decisions should be made, not on my own bias.\n \n Regarding the nuke: given that legal gun owners commit crimes with their legally bought guns (and that presumably this would extend to nukes), I'd say you have a great deal more faith in the adequacy of the current gun vetting process than I do.",

We've established that criminals have guns. We've established that the police use guns to defend themselves from these criminals. We haven't established whether or not you feel your life is important.\n \n These first three questions beg these follow up questions:\n \n 4) If criminals break the law (Hence: criminals) what does a law disarming people do to those who ignore it?\n \n 5) What does it do to those who don't break the law? Killing people is against the law already, right? So if a person follows the law, they won't kill in the first place.\n \n 6) What effect does a law disarming people who won't hurt anyone in the first place accomplish?\n \n 7) Since the lives of police are evidently valuable enough to defend with a firearm, why isn't yours?\n \n 8) If it's the duty of police to provide protection in the UK, can you sue them for negligence if you are assaulted and injured there?\n \n O.K. since we've established the police are responsible for your safety and not you, (Or else civilians would be afforded handguns, correct?) let's ask the following:\n \n 9) How do they provide protection from things that haven't happened yet? You can't really call the police BEFORE you're randomly shot in the head can you? (RING!: \"Hello? Police? Yes....I would like to report a murder. Well....I might be randomly shot in the head at some point. No, I haven't been shot yet. When? I don't know. Possibly tomorrow. Maybe next week. Yes, everything is just peachy right now. But I wanted to call the police just in case something happened at some point in the future.\")\n \n 10) Since you can't call police BEFORE being randomly shot in the head, how do you call police AFTER you've been shot in the head? (RING: \"Hello? Police? Yes....I'd like to report a murder. Yes.....well...it's me. I'm dead. Had my head blown clean off....yes. No, I don't know who did it. Just random. Yes, I know. I should have called yesterday.\")\n \n In my opinion, self-defense is the MOST valid reason for owning a handgun. I agree with you on the fact of having higher standards to determine qualification for owning a firearm, but once a person is shown to have a perfectly clean record......well? Isn't that a fairly good determinant that they obey the law? Now that we've established that one obeys the law, shouldn't they be afforded the same exact means both criminals (who ignore the law) and police (who enforce it) use? Unless of course, we determine the answer to question 1 is \"no\".\n \n By the way, How's the ol' UK Olympic Pistol Team doing? I'm sure they'll represent the UK wonderfully in the next games!",

   "Please excuse the unrelated questions....I will bring them together to illustrate a point that I feel is valid.\nTaking them point-by-point, then...\n1) Is your life worth defending, or is it something you could care less about?\nYes.\n2) In the UK, a civilian with a .40 caliber (or would it be calibre?) Glock semi-automatic pistol would be a criminal, right? Especially if they carried it hidden on their body?\nYes, all civilian ownership of handguns are banned by UK law. It's worth noting that I (probably) wouldn't go this far, but that's how it is at the moment.\n3) Police in the UK carry firearms for their protection, right?\n\n Nope. Regular police officers do not carry firearms - only in 'special circumstances'. See wikipedia for a fairly comprehensive summary.\n \nSo. We've established that criminals have guns. We've established that the police use guns to defend themselves from these criminals. We haven't established whether or not you feel your life is important.\n \n These first three questions beg these follow up questions:\n \n 4) If criminals break the law (Hence: criminals) what does a law disarming people do to those who ignore it?\nIt makes it harder for them to obtain and maintain possession of their firearms. It also means that anyone carrying a gun 'on their way to a crime' can be arrested for possesion before they get there. The implications of this question (which I imagine you are about to get to) also assume that all criminals buy a gun illegally and/or with the intent (at the time of purchase) for using it illegally, and that only criminals commit crime. Both of these are demonstratively false.\n \n \n5) What does it do to those who don't break the law? Killing people is against the law already, right? So if a person follows the law, they won't kill in the first place.\nThis assumes that all people without a past criminal record will never commit a crime, which (as stated before) is demonstratively false.\n6) What effect does a law disarming people who won't hurt anyone in the first place accomplish?\nNothing. However, those that are disarmed do not all fit into this category.\n \n7) Since the lives of police are evidently valuable enough to defend with a firearm, why isn't yours?\nSee above - most police officers do not carry firearms. This question is also flawed in that a police officer (especially an armed one) is much, much more likely to need to use that weapon in self-defence. It's not that their life is more valuable, simply that it's in more danger more frequently, so the ability to use deadly force is more justified. Police also have a much stricter policy on gun issuing than issuing to the general public - for example, training/testing is mandatory, and there is a database of who has what gun.\n \n \n8) If it's the duty of police to provide protection in the UK, can you sue them for negligence if you are assaulted and injured there?\nNot unless it was reasonably within their powers to prevent such an assault/injury.\n \n \nO.K. since we've established the police are responsible for your safety and not you. (Or else civilians would be afforded handguns, correct?)\n \n 9) How do they provide protection from things that haven't happened yet? You can't really call the police BEFORE you're randomly shot in the head can you? (RING!: \"Hello? Police? Yes....I would like to report a murder. Well....I might be randomly shot in the head at some point. No, I haven't been shot yet. When? I don't know. Possibly tomorrow. Maybe next week. Yes, everything is just peachy right now. But I wanted to call the police just in case something happened at some point in the future.\")\n \n 10) Since you can't call police BEFORE being randomly shot in the head, how do you call police AFTER you've been shot in the head? (RING: \"Hello? Police? Yes....I'd like to report a murder. Yes.....well...it's me. I'm dead. Had my head blown clean off....yes. No, I don't know who did it. Just random. Yes, I know. I should have called yesterday.\")\nThis is a slightly more absurd question.\n \n The police are not responsible for my safety - your assumption that 'otherwise people would be afforded handguns' is false. There are many other alternatives to handguns for self-defence purposes - either gadgetry such as burglar alarms, double glazing, rape alarms and mobile phones, or simple application of common sense. Handguns are not necessary.\n \n With that said, the police do also prevent crime. For example, by illegal arms seizure, or by increaced (visible) police presence. However, your initial argument is, again, demonstratively false.\n \n \nIn my opinion, self-defense is the MOST valid reason for owning a handgun. I agree with you on the fact of having higher standards to determine qualification for owning a firearm, but once a person is shown to have a perfectly clean record......well? Isn't that a fairly good determinant that they obey the law? Now that we've established that one obeys the law, shouldn't they be afforded the same exact means both criminals (who ignore the law) and police (who enforce it) use? Unless of course, we determine the answer to question 1 is \"no\".\nYou are correct, self-defence should be the most valid reason. However (as I believe I've said elsewhere), 'self-defence' opens up gun ownership to most of the population. If more guns made available 'for self-defence' are used to attack with, rather than to defend, doesn't that imply that the reason should be officially removed? Note that I have no issue with a gun being used in self-defence once it's been bought - I simply disagree with granting all and sundry access to deadly force, regardless of what it might actually be used for.\n \n \n \nBy the way, How's the ol' UK Olympic Pistol Team doing? I'm sure they'll represent the UK wonderfully in the next games! \nSuffering. Like I said, I doubt I'd go as far as the UK government.",

   "Nope. Regular police officers do not carry firearms\n\n \n O.K. I assumed they did similarly to police in the U.S. This clears things up.\n \n \nPolice also have a much stricter policy on gun issuing than issuing to the general public - for example, training/testing is mandatory, and there is a database of who has what gun.\n\n \n Then wouldn't strict policy on civilian ownership as well be more reasonable than a complete ban?\n \n \nHandguns are not necessary.\n\n \n I think this is the crux of our disagreement.

(i.e. disproportionate response)\n \n While I believe that any law abiding citizen should be able to have access to the means to defend themselves, I think a reasonable compromise is possible between our two sides.\n \n How's this: \n \n Instead of a complete ban, you concede that civilian gun ownership is a good thing and allow the reasonable ownership of handguns for personal protection.\n \n Instead of lassiz' faire \"guns for all who want them\", I'll concede that a strict regimen of licencing and training/qualification for those who wish to purchase. (In the U.K. Although this is reasonable, I'm not going for it in the U.S. This would be a HUGE concession to government control here.)\n \n A strict licencing/registration scheme would be allowing for MORE freedom in the U.K. It would be tightening a \"Nazi-like\" noose around our necks here in the U.S.\n \n If you are being burned at the stake, lethal injection sounds like a wonderful alternative.

   "I think you helped answer this question for me in another thread. If you removed all the gangs would it be a safer state?\n\n \n I believe it would; certainly do a lot better at reducing crime and violence against others than trying to disarm everybody would. If those who willfully break the law and commit harm to others aren't free to do so as they please, then all their bad efforts won't amount to anything and fewer people are likely to get hurt.\n \n It's a lot easier to put bad players in the penalty box than it is to try and make them play nice by punishing everybody else.\n \n \nYes but Africa is a 3rd world country, Oz much like America is not. :)\n\n \n I can't help but wondering something though. If Africa has no Second Amendment, and thus no legal right for anyone to have access to guns, and thus no legal ground for having gun shops, then why are these guerrillas getting their munitions?\n \n I have two theories on where all the weaponry is coming from. Either it's being illegally imported into the country, and in the process proving that the laws are doing very little to discourage or outline proper punishment for such behavior. Or the government itself is supplying the weapons from their own private store houses and carrying out a genocidal program against its own people.\n \n \nYikes, thats a loaded question ... the quick response would be; i guess there are more corrupt citizens than police so if i had to choose between trusting the two (by means of arming them) then yes, i would choose police.\n\n \n Why? Think about it seriously for a minute. Police officers start out life as regular citizens just like everybody else, yet we trust them to carry a gun and enforce the law, and expect them not to abuse their powers and authority. But it's not logical, they're just as human as you or me. Why is it that we somehow consider them more trustworthy just because they went through a 16 weeks training course that taught them the law, how to subdue a suspect without deadly force, how to fill out paperwork and how to handle different types of guns to a certain degree of competency. \n \n Those 16 weeks aren't going to erase the 20+ years of experience they already have, it's not going to change how they've learned to work and what gets the best results. Plus everyday they work around high levels of corruption, they see how a suspect they bust dead to rights is allowed to walk with almost no punishment whatsoever, they store large amounts of illegal drugs and ill gotten money to use as evidence for future court cases, and we honestly expect that 16 weeks of training to be enough to drive to human instinct out of them and make them more trustworthy than anybody else?\n \n \nOk i was correct for most and close for you emoticon_xhoho I really dont deny you have real threats in the USA, in much more abundance than i could ever fathom. I may be singing a different tune if i was raised there.\n\n \n I think that America just has more media coverage when it comes to violence than most. Everytime you turn around you're always hearing about one gang killing or something else. The people of this country are obsessed with the media and the reporting of violence. But other countries aren't much better off than we are. In the middle east we've got nations trying to destroy each other in the name of a holy war. In Japan the gangsters have become so organized they're now like the mafia and they don't even make any efforts to hide their activities from anybody. In China there are parents murdering their own children and getting away with it.\n \n \nAustralia went through a gun reform when i was little and our crime rates have halved. I am to young to have experienced both sides of the reform, in fact apart from the day my father handed over his rifle, gun rights (Australian) have never been a topic of conversation anywhere i've been present (untill this forum). Whatever aftermath you guys fear never eventuated here. I guess it may well be wishful thinking on my behalf that your country could benefit the same. :)\n\n \n I once had a conversation with somebody in Australia who was a security guard. He told me that ever since the new gun laws kicked in criminals had become more daring, even going so far as accosting security guards to steal their service weapons. He also told me that because of there supposedly being fewer guns in the nation, criminals are engaging in even more criminal acts than ever because they know they're less likely to get shot as a result.",

   ".... Funny. You compare California to Florida, yet when NATO brings up the slight problem of Washington D.C., WHOA! He's suddenly moving goalposts! \n\n \n Yes, he is. Violently. I was correcting HIS erroneous comparison that more people were killed in California than Florida, despite the tightest gun laws in California.\n \nThe ironic thing being that California has by far the strictest gun laws of any state in the country. Yet somehow, despite all these laws, California managed to have a higher death toll in 2007, than Florida did even though they have less strict laws. One can't help but wonder why is this the case?\n \n If laws did any good, then the state with the most would be the safest. But as you've said, California was very high in the death toll.\n \n\n \n When his error was countered with fact, he swiftly attempted to move discussion away from his mistake by bringing in new information (which incidentally FURTHER contradicts his own claim!) in order to avoid the fact hat he got it so badly wrong.

   "\n \n Why? Think about it seriously for a minute. Police officers start out life as regular citizens just like everybody else, yet we trust them to carry a gun and enforce the law, and expect them not to abuse their powers and authority. But it's not logical, they're just as human as you or me. Why is it that we somehow consider them more trustworthy just because they went through a 16 weeks training course that taught them the law, how to subdue a suspect without deadly force, how to fill out paperwork and how to handle different types of guns to a certain degree of competency. \n \n Those 16 weeks aren't going to erase the 20+ years of experience they already have, it's not going to change how they've learned to work and what gets the best results. Plus everyday they work around high levels of corruption, they see how a suspect they bust dead to rights is allowed to walk with almost no punishment whatsoever, they store large amounts of illegal drugs and ill gotten money to use as evidence for future court cases, and we honestly expect that 16 weeks of training to be enough to drive to human instinct out of them and make them more trustworthy than anybody else? \n\n \n Perhaps, but since i'm not involved in legal activity i have no reason to believe the police would harm me. How many annual instances do you no of where innocent citizens were shot by the police? now compare them to the statistics showing thousands of innocent citizens shot by other citizens. If i had to place guns in the hands of either police or civillians it feels like a no brainer to me.\n \n \n \n \nI think that America just has more media coverage when it comes to violence than most. Everytime you turn around you're always hearing about one gang killing or something else. The people of this country are obsessed with the media and the reporting of violence. But other countries aren't much better off than we are. In the middle east we've got nations trying to destroy each other in the name of a holy war. In Japan the gangsters have become so organized they're now like the mafia and they don't even make any efforts to hide their activities from anybody. In China there are parents murdering their own children and getting away with it. \n\n \n This is very true, the global media coverage of violence in America overshadows most. Also true that most countries arn't much better of, we are very forunate to live in a western culture.\n \n \nI once had a conversation with somebody in Australia who was a security guard. He told me that ever since the new gun laws kicked in criminals had become more daring, even going so far as accosting security guards to steal their service weapons. \n\n \n It would suck to be a security guard anywhere, their views are of course career biased. Its of no supprise the organised criminals would accost security guards since there isnt many options for them to obtain a firearm.\n \n \n ]\nHe also told me that because of there supposedly being fewer guns in the nation, criminals are engaging in even more criminal acts than ever because they know they're less likely to get shot as a result.\n\n \n Cant say i agree with this, crime will always occur, the severity of it has decreased due to the inability to yeild power via a firearm. But most importantly hundreds of innocent citizens have been saved every year since its induction.\n \n I read an article that said there has been zero events of mass shootings in Australia since the gun reform was enacted. In this day an age, and with the constant coverage of mass shootings around the world, who knows how many lives have been spared here. Im sure we have just as many deranged individuals as the rest of the world, but we have removed their power to enact such events, no columbine or virginia tech cases here.\n \n Do you honestly believe removing guns from the USA will increase your death toll? if so then how?

If i had to place guns in the hands of either police or civillians it feels like a no brainer to me.\n\n \n Before we get too far involved in this, I would suggest that we first try and determine just how many innocent citizens are shot by other innocent citizens. Maybe see how many CCW people were shot by fellow CCW people, etc. That way we don't run the risk of lumping in all the shootings that involve known criminals and distorting the facts.

Until this year DC had the strictest gun control laws in the entire nation. Absolutely nobody could own a handgun unless it was registered before 1976, and in 1977 the registration program was ended and served as a de-facto ban. Obtaining a shotgun or rifle requires permission from the police, and the police have very wide discretion in saying who can be armed and who can't. For a gun to be legal in DC it had to be stored either disassembled, bound by a locking device, or both. It was illegal to store ammunition in the same room as your gun, it was illegal to take your gun from one room of your home to another, it was illegal to have your gun assembled or loaded, there was no provision for having an operable firearm for protecting yourself. There were no gun stores in DC, and federal law prevents you from buying a gun outside of your state of residence unless you have it shipped back to your home state.\n \n In DC the laws were very simple on being in possession of guns outside the home; it was illegal no matter what, and the police were well within their power to arrest you on the spot just for that.\n \n But despite all of this, DC ranked at the murder capital of the United States, coming in with a per capita murder rate nearly four times higher than all of California. Apparently gunfire is so common in DC that the city needed to bring in shot sensors to alert the police of exactly when and where the gunfire was coming from, because most people stopped calling it in since it was happening too often. And this all despite the fact that there was no place in all of DC for criminals to get their guns from and there was no tolerance for being armed, or anything like that. All of DC's laws would suggest that their yearly murder rate only be in the single digits instead of being so much higher.\n \n And then there are the issues with actually trying to implement a gun ban scheme.

   "Busy, busy...\n \n First, a response to Superlite's post here, as I should have answered it a while ago. Then, a response to DC, because I've answered it before and some people (Ethmi - certainly; NATO - possibly) should know better by now.\n \n @Superlite:\n \n \nI think this is the crux of our disagreement. In my line of reasoning, I believe since criminals are obviously using firearms, the refusal to allow lawful citizens the same means of defense is unreasonable and unfair.\nI have said before (and still do, in fact) that allowing civilian access to firearms causes more harm than it prevents - because it allows total access. I guess a more novel way of putting it would be this: is a gun an offensive weapon, or a defensive weapon? Only if it is primarily defensive should it be unrestricted - and this certainly doesn't seem to be the case.\n \n \nInstead of a complete ban, you concede that civilian gun ownership is a good thing and allow the reasonable ownership of handguns for personal protection.\n \n Instead of lassiz' faire \"guns for all who want them\", I'll concede that a strict regimen of licencing and training/qualification for those who wish to purchase. (In the U.K. Although this is reasonable, I'm not going for it in the U.S. This would be a HUGE concession to government control here.)\nWait a second. You want me to concede and change the UK's laws to more match your ideals, but you refuse to change the US's laws to more match mine despite the fact that you concede? That's hardly consistent.\n \n Make it 'and allow the reasonable ownership of handguns for sporting/work-related purposes', and you're pretty much at what I propose, however. No ban - just control. People can enjoy owning guns, but they shouldn't be buying them with another human being in mind, because in the places where that is possible the 'other human being' is an innocent rather than a criminal more often than not.\n \n @The whole DC argument:\n \n 1. DC is not just a regular state, it is a city. It has by far the highest population density - more than 8 times the next highest on the list. As population density is a significant driver of crime rates (urban crime <<< rural crime), it's hardly surprising that this is the case.\n \n 2. DC does not have the border controls that the UK does. The hardest thing you have to do to smuggle a gun into DC is drive over a bridge - that doesn't make for a particularly enforcible weapons ban. Where control is more enforcible (read: the UK), homicides are significantly less.\n \n 3. The gun ban in DC does appear to have had a positive effect (I hadn't seen that one before. Thanks, Galileo). NATO: your reply to the study is completely bogus - why should the expansion of a gunshot sensor depend on the decline/rise in homicides, given that there is still a very high rate?

Only if it is primarily defensive should it be unrestricted - and this certainly doesn't seem to be the case.\n \n\n \n Whether it's defensive or offensive depends on how it's used in a particular situation, and what it's compared to. If you compare all relevant factors between a handgun and a rifle than a handgun is obviously a defensive weapon. If it's used against someone bent on committing harm to innocent people then it's a defensive weapon.\n \n But just to examine the other side of the coin, just because something is designed as a purely defensive tool doesn't mean that such is the case.

Now if the police need sensors to let them know where the gunfire is coming from on any particular day, that would suggest that the 30+ years of the ban being in place have done nothing to make things any safer than they were in 1976.\n \n If a law is working to reduce crime and violence, why would you have any possible need to expand a detection program beyond its original parameters?

Expanding a successful program will prevent more crime - no-one is claiming that gun control is purely the cause of reduced crime rates either, just that it is a contributing factor.\n \n You're doing the equivalent of arguing that body armour is ineffective, because soldiers still get shot in wars - and the military are making the armour on tanks thicker, too!",

   "Alaska's gun deaths are about 20 per 100k, which is second highest in the nation! However, they also have the absolute lowest population density in the US. \nA country/state has a 'population density' (call it X), but you shouldn't read from this that there are precisely X people per square mile, for every square mile throughout the state - the population is not homogeneously spread. Instead, there will be regions in every state where the population density is comparatively low (the more rural areas) and regions where the population density is comparatively high (the urban areas). It's easy to see that two states with identical population densities could have very different layouts - one could be averagely populated (homogenised) and one could consist of a few isolated cities and huge unpopulated rural areas. \n \n As such, while the population density of a given area is a large factor in crime rates, you can't take the population density of an entire state as indicative of this - to do so assumes that the state is homogeneously populated, which simply isn't the case.\n \n Looking at Alaska in particular, the crime rate suggests that Alaska is more polarised than homogeneous: that is, there are very few people living in large rural areas, and most people live in high-population-density cities. This isn't a guarantee - we've both agreed previously that there are other factors which affect crime - but the suggestion is there. A quick look suggests that this indeed the case.\n \n Incidentally, Alaska has very lax gun laws. Hardly surprising, given its Republican leanings (eeep, Palin!), but it's a nice reminder that you seem to be picking and choosing which bits of data you look at. Didn't I say something similar back when you tried this argument many, many months ago?\n \n EDIT:\n Ach, Penfold beat me to it. I said it with more words, though :p.",

We've all heard the middle east talk about wanting to destroy us in a sea of fire because we're infidels, we heard Obama's preacher of more than 20 years preach a message of white hatred, etc. People make no secret of the fact that they hate America, so why should we act deaf and dumb and pretend that nothing bad is going to happen to us?\n \n \nI apologize, of course they do.

   "It's been a pleasure. \n\n And to you.\n \n I would like to end, if end this be, on one note - because I can't help but feel you are looking at this with the attitude you expressed originally, that guns are being handed out on the basis of 'responsibility', or 'worth'. You seem to think that the pro-control side are allowing police firearms on the basis that 'only they are responsible', or that 'they are more valuable than civilians' - and that, as such, there is a hypocrisy/inconsistency in the pro-control view with regards to a pro-control advocates self-image of 'responsibility' or 'worth'. However, this simply isn't true - because the premise is flawed, so are the conclusions. I'm still working (in my minimal free time) on a mega-post which pieces my whole view together, but for now, I'll settle for a shorter answer.\n \n Guns are 'handed out', not on the basis of 'responsibility' or 'worth', but on the basis of who needs them most. This means that police get firearms because they have more dangerous jobs, although ideally (like in the UK) they would not carry them unless the situation required. Soldiers in a hostile country get to carry them all the time, and civilians only get them if their work/sport requires it. \n \n The reason for limiting civilian access is based on statistics - in today's America, if a civilian has a gun, it is more likely to be used in a criminal act than against a criminal act (although both are relatively rare). As such, limiting civilian access to firearms will impact crime more than personal defence, even though 'criminals' will not be affected as much as the law-abiding.\n \n In short, I'd rather have a woman defend herself with mace and a nail file, if it means that her attacker is far less likely to be carrying a gun - because if he does have a gun, she is probably doomed from the start: regardless of the contents of her purse. Gun control results in reduced defensive capability for civilians, but a smaller need for defensive capability in the first place.",

   "Not even when the choice involves being self-reliant, or having to depend on someone else to come to your rescue when a problem arises?\nThe police are not responsible for my safety\nHow many times am I going to have to post this?\n \n @Superlite: I imagine when Hollyh says 'we', she means 'the pro-control side' - although that whole post should be expanded to read 'the pro-control side do not want people to be able to have that choice'. I don't particularly consider this to be an arrogant opinion, any more than wanting robbery to be illegal is arrogant - both wants are based on the idea that the law will make life safer for all concerned. At the loss of a freedom, true (in both cases - what about the freedom to rob!), but that leads me onto a second, more novel talking point.\n \n You've ventured into a different topic here, which is half 'freedom vs security' and half 'slippery slope'. The implication is that because gun control advocates prefer the security afforded by gun control at the cost of a limited freedom to bear arms, they should also support measures which take away massive 'freedoms' in order to gain slight 'securities' - which would end in a totalitarian government and all the people kept in padded cells being fed gruel at regular intervals (the aim of V.I.K.I. in the film I, Robot springs to mind). It's been brought up before, but I've never got around to answering it - and I think it's one of the few large pro-gun arguments that I haven't seen (or, more often, typed) an answer to. So - here goes nothing.\n \n My response would be that pro-gunners are also guilty of sacrificing freedoms for security. Several of the 'inalienable rights' enumerated in the Constitution are waived under various circumstances - the Patriot act and (not for long) Gitmo are more extreme examples, but there are the everyday/accepted lapses such as a ban on paedophillia and shouting 'fire' in a movie theatre, or preventing felons from owning guns. The only difference between the two sides (pro-guns vs pro-control) is that they draw the line at different points - just because pro-control favours slightly more security does not mean that they want totalitarianism, just as pro-gunners do not want anarchy just because they favour slightly more freedom (the pro-gun 'criminals don't obey laws so laws are pointless' argument notwithstanding).\n \n The question then becomes, 'where do you draw the line between freedom and security'?\n \n My response to this question - and my rationale for drawing it where I do - is that the factor we should be aiming to maximise is not freedom or security, but 'quality of life for the population as a whole', which both freedom and security contribute to. This explains why you can't shout 'fire' in a movie theatre, just as it explains why (almost) everyone should be free from padded cells and gruel - because if either of those were to occur, the quality of life of the population as a whole would decrease. \n \n This explains, also, why I don't particularly care about increaced CCTV in public spaces - given that it doesn't affect me unless I am breaking the law or being victimised, why should I care about being on camera in my public life? The 'what happens when the government goes corrupt' argument is always raised at times like these, but I'd just point out that maintaining and renewing CCTV cameras would be prohibitively expensive if vandalism was made a national pastime (I'd also point out the massive unlikelihood of a corrupt government getting that far). This also explains away the other straw men brought up by the pro-gun side - banning the internet and cars going <5mph both spring to mind.\n \n How, then, does this view - 'to maximise quality of life for the population as a whole' - affect the freedom to bear arms vs the security to not get shot at? Note what I have said before - I am not aiming to restrict the right to bear arms for sporting purposes, so 'quality of life' is not affected in that regard. With this in mind, the only two things remaining by which gun control would affect quality of life are these: Quality of life improves, due to reduced crime rates, and quality of life diminishes because some people can't buy a gun for the purpose of self-defence - despite the fact that they are safer without their guns than they were when guns were 'uncontrolled', the (statistically) fake sense of security would still be there (as evidenced by several on this forum).\n \n This leaves me with the conclusion that I've stated before, just previously without the rationale - that the pro-gun side seems to not care how many people die, so long as they get the safety blanket effect (to coin a phrase) of owning a gun.\n \n I welcome your comments.\n \n Postscript: See other posts of mine (in this topic, and in others) for the rationale as to why crime rates would decrease with gun control.\n \n \n \n ***marked***, so I can find this post easily again if needs be.",

   "i just dont think about problems arising. Thats what i (and others) have been trying to say, we just dont think about these kinds of issues on a daily basis, i dont feel threatened by my society.\n\n \n By this line of logic, the knowledge (whether intentional, or unintentional) or lack thereof is the sole determinant of whether an action is justified or not.\n \n I don't think about housefires. Therefore, according to your line of reasoning, I have no need for a fire extinguisher. Not only that. Seeing your willingness to speak for all in the above posts,since I refuse to think about house fires, NOBODY needs to purchase a fire extinguisher, right?\n \n After all, according to you, if nobody thinks of the need for self-defense, it isn't needed. Anyone who believes this must be paranoid.\n \n So, my question is this: Because you....I'm sorry...you (and others) refuse to think about these things, does this mean their reality does not exist?\n \n In the four years I have been carrying a firearm, I have never even felt the need to remove it from its holster. You (and others) continuously ask: Since I've never felt the need for it, why carry it?\n \n Answer: Because I realize the obvious truth that you blatantly deny in your above quote. How I feel, what I think, and any other opinions I may hold DO NOT DETERMINE REALITY. I'm sure the students at Virginia Tech did not \"think about these issues\". I'm 100% sure they never \"felt threatened by their society\".\n \n Well, they're feelings had nothing to do with the reality of a nutcase busting in and purposefully killing them at will, did it? \n \n You say I'm paranoid? Never. I have no reason to be so. I'm just acknowledging that maybe there's a reality that might exist whether or not I choose to think about it. If I encounter an \"issue\", I will have prepared for its mere existance. Yet, some here will say I'm paranoid and preparing for what I think is an eventuality (which I will address next). You (and others) who write your reality in stone on what you decide to think about, might just be a little surprised if these issues rear their ugly heads into your preconcieved reality.\n \n \nThey truly feel that they must arm themselves against their neighbors\n\n \n How arrogant and presumptious. Not to mention iognorant. Want the truth? If I were to say \"here's what chester thinks\", would I be accurate? How do you know what gun owners think? Have you ever carried a firearm? Are you speaking from experience? Or, are you letting your preconcieved notions of WHAT YOU THINK people are like determine what YOUR reality is?\n \n Some people call this \"stereotyping\".\n \n So, basicly, since you presume to speak \"here's what they think\", yet you have never carried a gun, you are posting your presumption and ignorance here for all to see.\n \n You can't even wrap your mind around the concept of a firearm as a defensive weapon. You walk by people carrying them every day, yet the metal disk pinned to their chest removes any semblance of humanity from your eyes. It's as if they're invisible to the rules that apply to your argument. This wonderful \"badge\" talisman magicly removes the applicability of your argument.\n \n People who carry guns are paranoid. Civilian: YES! Cop: No.\n People with guns are dangerous! Civilian: YES! Cop: No.\n Guns are evil! Civilian: YES! Cop: No.\n \n I wonder what happens when a gun owner points out this disparity of thought?\n \n Probably the same thing as happens when he asks: If gun control works, how do you explain how Washington D.C. leads the nation in firearm homicides if they have a 100% ban on firearms?",

How I feel, what I think, and any other opinions I may hold DO NOT DETERMINE REALITY. \n\n \n Firstly you should read your original post below, hence the bold type.\n \n \nMany times, we pose questions in this forum to which we believe we already know the answer, yet post them anyway in an attempt to draw those with opposing views into a debate or discussion in which to bludgeon them with our self-determined \"TRUTH\".\n \n\n \n Next, what is the obvious truth? it seems it is not at all obvious but merely a subjective/objective opinion that you hold. Please quote where i \"blatantly deny\" the inferred opinion.\n \n \nI'm sure the students at Virginia Tech did not \"think about these issues\". I'm 100% sure they never \"felt threatened by their society\".\n Well, they're feelings had nothing to do with the reality of a nutcase busting in and purposefully killing them at will, did it? \n\n \n Unlike the USA where mass killings do exist, Australia does not suffer these occurrences (ie Virginia Tech, Columbine ...) therefore the realities of this situation occurring are beyond slim. So tell me why we should be concerned with things that have little probability of occurring in my country.\n \n \n \nYou say I'm paranoid? Never. I have no reason to be so. I'm just acknowledging that maybe there's a reality that might exist whether or not I choose to think about it. If I encounter an \"issue\", I will have prepared for its mere existence. Yet, some here will say I'm paranoid and preparing for what I think is an eventuality (which I will address next). \n\n \n Did i say you were paranoid? i dont recall doing so, but i will use the word in closing.\n \n \nYou (and others) who write your reality in stone on what you decide to think about, might just be a little surprised if these issues rear their ugly heads into your preconcieved reality. \n\n \n Your full of assumptions, who wrote what reality in stone? or is this once again just your opinion?\n And of what \"issues\", firearm violence? i believe i have a better chance of being hit by a bus, will i be surprised if i do? i imagine we all would, does that mean i should avoid buses or consider every situation that poses odds greater than firearm violence? there would not be enough hours in the day to imagine, let alone work to protect oneself from all these \"issues\" or \"realities\".\n \n You started this thread to understand \"our\" (anti-gunners)position and then you attack those who respond to \"our\" with \"we\". Obviously as Ian pointed out, i was referring to those in the \"our\" category that had been echoing the same sentiments. \n Weather you understand or agree with what \"we\" are saying does not change our views. You asked for them and here is one \"We dont think about being killed by guns on a daily basis\".\n \n I am very aware of the HUGE difference in realities between our countries, in fact i do try to understand your perspective. You (and just you, not all pro gun advocates) on the other hand cannot fathom a world outside your own and lay ignorant to the extreme difference in realities. Your reality is not universal, your need to arm yourself with weapons is not a universal need, the issues in which you wish to protect yourself against are statistically far more probable to you than many other countries.\n \n I do not live your reality, i do not feel the need to arm myself, i do not think of protecting myself against firearm events with very minimal probability, these are the realities of my life in Australia. \n If you thought the way you do now whilst living in Australia we would be right to call you paranoid.",

   "I'm sorry, I must have missed this. (Got confused with the whole \" link to another link, linking to a link to a link\" thing you have going on.)\n \n \n1. DC is not just a regular state, it is a city. It has by far the highest population density - more than 8 times the next highest on the list. As population density is a significant driver of crime rates (urban crime <<< rural crime), it's hardly surprising that this is the case.\n\n \n So, the fact that the \"area\" has a complete ban depends completely on semantics? The area must be called a \"state\" in order for the murders with a firearm to be valid? Wouldn't the fact that a CITY has a higher firearm death rate than a STATE be counterproductive to your argument? Oh! I see. We're now using \"population density\" to determine the effectiveness of gun control laws. But I thought gun control laws were GOOD for ALL? Now you're arguing that gun control is ineffective with high population densities? You would have to. You can change the semantics all you want. You can bring in all the different units of measurement you want. You can call Washington D.C. a \"unincorporated major township\" or \"a significant unstatelike entity\". IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU CALL IT. Now it depends on its population density! But I thought gun control was good for all? I didn't know the effectiveness of gun control depended on population density! Fact: Complete ban/highest gun murder rate. Can't dance around it.\n \n \n2. DC does not have the border controls that the UK does. The hardest thing you have to do to smuggle a gun into DC is drive over a bridge - that doesn't make for a particularly enforcible weapons ban. Where control is more enforcible (read: the UK), homicides are significantly less.\n\n \n Oh wait! I thought it was because of the \"high population density\". Now open borders are the reason. Unfortunately for your argument, we were never COMPARING Washington D.C. to the U.K. So, explaining that D.C.'s rate is higher than the U.K. because of open borders is, on your part, correct. However, WE'RE NOT COMPARING D.C. and the U.K.! We're comparing Washington D.C. to the rest of America! THERE ARE NO CLOSED BORDERS IN THE U.S.! Therefore, instead of redirecting the comparison to the U.K., how about sticking to the U.S. and explaining how IF THERE ARE NO CLOSED BORDERS BETWEEN BOISE IDAHO AND WASHINGTON D.C. Why the difference? Closed borders are irrellevant. We're comparing the U.S. to...the U.S.\n \n \n3. The gun ban in DC does appear to have had a positive effect (I hadn't seen that one before. Thanks, Galileo). NATO: your reply to the study is completely bogus - why should the expansion of a gunshot sensor depend on the decline/rise in homicides, given that there is still a very high rate? All that you article implies is that a gunshot sensor is another succesful way at tackling gun crime.\n\n \n \n3. The gun ban in DC does appear to have had a positive effect \n\n \n Huh? So I point out the statistic that Washington D.C.'s firearm murder rate is higher per capita than anywhere else, and this draws argument. One argument consists of stating positive benefits of the firearms ban. HOW DOES THIS CONTRADICT THE ORIGINAL STATISTIC?!? \n \n It's like arguing \"Since knives are banned in Kukamonga, Oklahoma, how can it have the highest stabbing death rate in the nation?\" And your argument for this being a good thing is that hospital visits due to lacerations are much lower there.\n \n It doesn't answer the question about MURDER!\n \n Now.

   "Superlite:\n You remember back in post #73, you thanked me for my 'decent sense of civility'? You might want to bring yourself back into that category. But... I digress. To the replymobile!\n \n You seem to be assuming that because I favour gun control, I assume it will be a shiny clean solution that will instantly eliminate all crime without the need for any other intervention. You also seem to be assuming that there is only one factor that affects crime; that is, if guns are controlled or not. In both cases, you are incorrect.\n \n There is more than one factor which affects crime levels - population density is most certainly one of them. Therefore, because all of DC lives in a high-population-density area, it's hardly surprising that there is a high crime rate compared to other states.\n \n That DC has no border control means that looking at the results in comparison with other states is almost totally irrelevant. It's only (mainly) when gun laws are enforceable that they become effective - because there is no way to prevent people from illegally bringing guns into the city, people do just that. The study I linked to earlier shows that when a law is enforced, it has successful results.\n \n The fact that crime levels are now decreasing thanks to gun control is highly significant. The best way to compare results is to compare DC without gun control to DC with gun control - this eliminates most of the problems brought up by my first point, as most of the factors that influence crime are the same. It's the scientific method - you keep all other variables the same, and change the one you want to investigate. What this comparison implies is that gun control has had a positive effect on a troubled city. No-one is denying that there is high crime there - what we are denying is that gun control has anything to do with it.\n \n To quote myself from earlier in the thread: \"You're doing the equivalent of arguing that body armour is ineffective, because soldiers still get shot in wars\". Another analogy would be that you are arguing that because you felt hotter standing in your shorts (in Hawaii) than when you were wearing a coat (in the Arctic), shorts keep you warmer.\n \n Seeing as you seem to be looking at my old posts: any response to my posts here and here? Both tackle fairly large portions of your argument, but neither got any sort of response from the pro-gun crowd.\n \n EDIT@NATO - An alternative response to the 'if X didn't exist, Y would not happen': \n This is fairly relevant to the long post I wrote in this thread about 'quality of life'. If you can't decide whether or not to control X, you need to look at the quality of life it gives - does the benefits from owning X outweigh the disadvantages of Y? It's certainly the case for cars, knives, cameras and flammable materials - Marx (et al) argued over money, and many people argue over alcohol. I've been arguing that for guns (where X is 'owning a gun for self-defence' and Y is 'being victimised with a gun'), Y largely outweighs X.\n In short, false analogies, as there is a distinguishing feature between guns and many of the other things on your list.",

   "Have there been cases where the self-defense claim was negated and resulted in prosecution of the homeowner?\n\n \n Yes. I have personally prosecuted such cases. I'm not going to give out names, but I'll tell you how one such case was handled. It was a husband who shot his wife.\n \n The husband claimed he was fast asleep at night on the couch of his living room. He kept a handgun with him on the coffee table. He claimed he was suddenly awakened by the sound of someone kicking their way through the front door leading into the living room. He claimed the lights were not on, that the sudden intrusion made him fear a burglar was breaking in to attack him, that he jumped up while frightened for his life, that he grabbed his gun, and that he shot the suspected burglar to defend himself and his home. He claimed he cut on the lights afterwards and realized his tragic mistake-he had killed his wife coming in the house while carrying groceries. His claim was that she had been kicking the door open because her hands were full. Law enforcement arrived and found the victim in the doorway surrounded by grocery bags. But the facts did not bear out his claim....\n \n He claimed he shot at her from across the room, a distance of about 15 feet (and far enough away that he claimed he could not identify her without a light on). But the autopsy found \"stippling\" on the victim's skin (small pock-mark burns caused by contact with burning gunpowder discharge). This was an indicator that the gun was much, much closer to the victim. In addition, these cases always involve the suspect being willing to co-operate by identifying the firearm used (a .45 auto in this case). His gun was taken and test fired for comparison with the gunshot residue pattern found on the victim and her clothing. I don't remember the exact distances, but our firearms expert concluded that the muzzle of the weapon would have been a minimum of a little over 2 feet to a maximum of just shy of 3 feet from the victim's chest when fired-in short, he ambushed her at a distance close enough he could have reached out and touched her. At trial we took wooden dowel rods of these two lengths and placed them into the barrel of the gun to demonstrate just how close he was when he shot her. I still have those rods lying around in the office. \n \n Interviews after the shooting with friends disclosed the husband had been making comments about how unhappy his marriage had become. Finally, the house used a microcassette recording answering machine. Found on the answering machine tape was a conversation the husband accidentally recorded of himself talking with his until then unknown girlfriend-during which he made several references to the effect of wanting to get rid of his wife so he could be with her. Ironically, this was discovered by mistake by a family member of the victim who decided on their own to check the machine some days after the shooting. Law enforcement did not discover it first because they did not have any information about a tape and consequently the search warrant they executed the night of the shooting did not authorize a search of the answering machine messages. It proved to be powerful evidence of motive for the murder conviction. \n \n I teach a legal responsibility portion of a local CCW training course. I always ask the class has anyone heard someone say \"if you shot him outside then drag his body back to the house and drape him coming through an open window.\" I always get some laughs and people say they have heard that. Then I tell them don't do it. I tell them that to start with officers will wonder how he could have been shot in the back while coming at you through your bedroom window. But I also tell them that when the medical examiner finds post-mortem scratches on his face and dirt up his nose then we will know you shot him in the yard and then dragged him across the sidewalk and through the flower garden to your window. \n \n There are cases where self-defense is claimed and even the story itself does not establish self-defense. I wish I had a dollar for every time I heard someone justify hitting someone by saying \"we were arguing and I saw he was going to hit me so I hit him back first.\" This is not self-defense. Even where the claim sounds legitimate, however, we are able to weed out the illegitimate ones by comparing them with the facts. Either the facts don't match the claim, or (more frequently), we find that the facts have been manipulated after the shooting to justify the claim (like finding a knife placed in the right had of a left-handed man which also bears the shooter's DNA or fingerprints) \n \n You must understand that when any shooting/stabbing/beating occurs, and particularly where a death results, law enforcement begins the investigation with a skeptical attitude. Law enforcement will not just accept the word of the homeowner and leave it at that. They compare what they hear with what they see and learn from a thorough investigation. When the investigation is complete they bring every incident to the prosecutor for review. There have been cases where I have declined prosecution because the facts show legitimate self-defense/defense of others/defense of habitation. The example above is just one which we decided to prosecute.",

Forensically(sp?) speaking? \n \n I'm wondering if you're aware of any case of the more garden variety, where say, a 200 lb plus homeowner blasts the 135 lb 17 yr old unarmed burglar? Can it be suggested that he might have easily used less than lethal force?\n\n \n \n I don't think it would have been easier to \"get away with it\" without a firearm in my case example. In the example I used the defense was mistaken identity, which required distance from the victim and a believable explanation for the phone call evidence. I suppose he could have used a bow or a crossbow, but if he missed or only wounded his wife then he would have had some explaining to do. Forensically speaking it is nearly impossible to measure distance to target with a bow or crossbow, and the same applies with a firearm once the distance reaches generally over say about 8 feet away.\n \n Every home invasion shooting is different. I would not call any of them \"garden variety.\" The most immediate and paramount factor for investigation of a claimed home invasion shooting is the truthfulness of the homeowner/shooter. Lying or manipulation of the crime scene provides evidence that the shooting was not justified. \n \n Castle doctrine defensive shooting claims are measured the same as standard self-defense claims-viewing the facts from the viewpoint of the shooter, did he reasonably fear the intruder's actions presented a threat of death or great bodily harm. We have to be careful not to apply the clarity of perfect hindsight to a situation where sudden shoot/don't shoot decisions have to be made-often in the dead of night-and often forced to be made on incomplete knowledge. \n \n A burglar's perceived height/weight/strength disadvantage is one factor which can and sometimes is considered, but only in a situation where the burglar gives the homeowner enough time and opportunity to first discover the intruder is both unarmed and much weaker. We have to work off of facts that a reasonable person knew or should have known if they were the homeowner firing the shot(s). Ironically, shooting quickly could potentially shield the homeowner from having to confront facts like an unarmed and much smaller intruder-so long as the facts justify responding to the intruder with deadly force at the time the shot is fired. Nothing requires a homeowner in my state to announce that he/she has armed themselves, or to politely inquire of the burglar whether he is armed, or to trust any response the burglar provides. If, however, a homeowner is able to \"corner\" a burglar, and he is able to see that the intruder is truly unarmed, that he is much weaker physically, and that he is not actually trying to attack or disarm the homeowner, and the homeowner shoots him anyway then I would call that revenge and not legitimate self-defense or defense of habitation. \n \n ---\n \n \"And indeed, gentlemen, there exists a law, not written down anywhere but written in our hearts; a law which comes to us not by training or custom or reading but by derivation and absorption and adoption from nature itself; a law which has come to us not by theory but from practice, not by instruction but by natural intuition. I refer to the law which lays it down that, if our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right. When weapons reduce them to silence, the laws no longer expect one to await their pronouncements. For people who decide to wait for these will have to wait for justice, too--and meanwhile they must suffer injustice first. Indeed, even the wisdom of the law itself, by a sort of tacit implication, permits self- defense, because it does not actually forbid men to kill; what it does, instead, is to forbid the bearing of a weapon with the intention to kill. When, therefore, an inquiry passes beyond the mere question of the weapon and starts to consider the motive, a man who has used arms in self-defense is not regarded as having carried them with homicidal aim.\" Cicero, Selected Political Speeches, p. 222 (M. Grant, trans. 1975) \n \n \"Who does not see that self-defense is a duty superior to every precept. . . .\n [T]he laws of an Italian republic, where bearing fire-arms is punished as a capital crime and where it is not more fatal to make an ill use of them than to carry them, is not agreeable to the nature of things.\" Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws (trans. T. Nugent, 1899).\n \n \"And I cannot see, why arms should be denied to any man who is not a slave, since they are the only true badges of liberty. . . .The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave. He who has nothing, and belongs to another, must be defended by him, and needs no arms: but he who thinks he is his own master, and has anything he may call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself and what he possesses, or else he lives precariously and at discretion. And though for a while those who have the sword in their power abstain from doing him injury; yet, by degrees, he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command. Our ancestors, by being always armed, and frequently in action, defended themselves against the Romans, Danes, and English; and maintained their liberty against encroachments of their own princes.\" Andrew Fletcher, Political Works, pp. 35 and 221 (1749).\n \n \"In Mississippi rebel State forces, men who were in the rebel armies, are traversing the State, visiting the freedmen, disarming them, perpetrating murders and outrages on them. . . .\" Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, at p. 40 (December 13, 1865) [Speech of Senator Henry Wilson (Republican-Massachusetts)]\n \n \"Sir, I find in the Constitution of the United States an article which declares that \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" For myself, I shall insist that the reconstructed rebels of Mississippi respect the Constitution in their local laws. . . .\" Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, p. 1838 (April 7, 1866) [Speech of congressman Sindey Clarke (Republican-Kansas)].\n \n \"Make the colored man a citizen of the United States and he has every right which you or I have as citizens of the United States under the laws and Constitution of the United States. . . .He has a defined status; he has a country and a home; a right to defend himself and his wife and children; a right to bear arms. . . .\" Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 2, p. 1266 (March 8, 1866) [Speech of congressman Henry J. Raymond (Republican-New York)]\n \n \"Editor Loyal Georgian: Have colored persons a right to own and carry firearms?-A Colored Citizen\n Almost every day we are asked questions similar to the above. We answer certainly you have the same right to own and carry arms that other citizens have. You are not only free but citizens of the United States and as such entitled to the same privileges granted to other citizens by the Constitution. . . .\n Article II, of the amendments to the Constitution of the United States, gives the people the right to bear arms, and states that this right shall not be infringed. Any person, white or black, may be disarmed if convicted of making an improper or dangerous use of weapons, but no military or civil officer has the right or authority to disarm any class of people, thereby placing them at the mercy of others. All men, without distinction of color, have the right to keep and bear arms to defend their homes, families or themselves.\" From issues of the Loyal Georgian, January 20, 27 and February 3, 1866.\n \n \"The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.\" Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300.",

   "Well said OreoPuddin. Very well said. A lot of what you said reminds me of what happened to me in the late 80's. \n \n I became disabled and had to retrain for a new career. I had no family that could help so I had to move into a Cleveland Housing projects while I went back to college. While there I saw massive drug dealing, which also drew prostitution, and gambling. I saw street or parking lot gambling, public intoxication and public urination, and an occasional dead body, all from the drug dealing. However, I figured that the drug dealers weren't bothering me so what did I care. After all, I was only going to be there for a very short time and it is a victimless crime right? \n \n Ah huh!\n \n Allow me to expel a few falsehoods. First of all, most every one of the drug dealers were NOT residence of the housing project, and neither were they the majority of their customers. Most all of the residents, although many were undereducated, were, in fact, good-hearted people who were, for the most part, good neighbors too.\n \n I was speaking to a neighbor, single mother of 2, and she was telling me that her children do not sleep on their beds at night. When I pressed her about this, she embarrassedly admitted that they sleep under their beds because of the almost nightly gunfire from the Drug dealers, and their patrons. Not residents. Most of the gun fire was from the drug dealers showing off, I am figuring, or testing out a gun being traded for crack. Any way, when I heard this, I lost my Natural mind. I thought to myself that in no way would I allow this to go on while I was on this Earth, while I could do something about it. I called the cops and was referred to the Housing police. They said they would do about as much as they can but their efforts were pretty ineffective. So I video taped all of the actors doing their crimes and took telephoto still pictures for positive identification and never told a sole that I was doing it because just before this, a church worker was murdered by the drug dealers because he inadvertently video taped a drug dealer while producing a video to try and spur donations. \n \n I mailed it to the Housing police and told my Senator, John Glenn about everything and his office got involved. They told the Housing authority, and the DEA, I think and contacted my Ohio State elected officials. There was an attempt to clean up the problem but it was not in any way what I thought the effort should be since the evidence I gathered had them dead to rights. They instead said they were going to concentrate their efforts on the Drug Buyers instead of the sellers. I thought, What? That isn't going to solve anything, but I waited to see the results. Noting! Absolutely Nothing, but a show.\n \n It was not long after the show that the son of a neighbor came over and told me that Moody, the head of the drug dealers was going to kill me, because he somehow found out about the video tapes and the photos. I talked to the Cleveland Police and was again referred to the housing police, so I went down to their off ice and talked to the Captain, who informed me that I was, indeed, in a heap of danger. I asked him what I could do and he told me that if I did not own a gun to buy one and carry it. He explained that (Before Ohio's CCW laws) there was a statute on the books called the prudent man defense. It seemed that the Ohio legislators in their wisdom, did not want to make any laws that violated common sense and put the law abiding in a trick bag for running afoul of a law that they could in no way obey. Hense, the Prudent Man Defense. \n \n To make a painfully long story short, I was once confronted by a drug dealer, and I produced my pistol. After that all of the Drug Dealers left me along, but was told that Moody was still planning to kill me. \n \n My friend from school knows a Cleveland Cop and told him about what was happening to me with a whole bunch of harassment and vandalism, and my friend was told by the cop, \" Let the Black uneducated people kill each other! My friend explained that I was white and a Veteran and that I did not deserve to be left totally unprotected the way I was, and the cop again said, \" I Said! Let the Negroes Kill each other.\" Which was extremely typical of my experience there.\n \n At any rate, Moody was shortly arrested and convicted of murdering someone else and the Drug Dealers moved down as far away from me as they could. Before I left, only two people were ever arrested. Moody and another drug dealer, but no arrest were ever made even after all of the evidence I presented.\n \n So you can blow and go all you want to, but guns also save lives. And From what I later found out, I was just one of the 2.5 Million Defensive Gun uses every year.\n \n So gun controllers. What would you have done? :)",

   "But we don't have a polite society.\n\n \n That's because there are too many criminals and drug dealers who're still walking free. Take away those that import and deal in illegal drugs and see what difference that makes.\n \n \nWe have millions of guns and many, many shootings.\n\n \n Yeah...you can't have shootings if you don't have guns. However on the flipside, you can't put a stop to anything (except the death of criminals by the law-abiding citizens) by taking guns away. People who want to commit suicide will still do so. Thugs that want to terrorize innocent people still still do so. Carjackings and muggings won't come to a halt. Women will still be assaulted and murdered by their ex-husbands. Stabbings will become much more commonplace.\n \n \nMost crimes are committed with late model weapons manufactured in the USA. Something like 3 yrs old or less.\n\n \n Proof please.\n \n \nAny hope of changing these statistics will require some concessions from gun enthusiasts.\n\n \n No it won't. We don't need more gun control laws that do nothing more than harass us. What we need is genuine crime fighting solutions.\n \n \nWhat are any of you prepared to suggest?\n\n \n Let's see...how about mandatory life sentences for anyone who commits a violent crime while in possession of a gun? Hold up a liquor store, you go away for the rest of your days. \n \n For gun traffickers it's even better. If you're found guilty of intentionally trafficking/supplying guns to people with known criminal records and the amount of weapons is more than 20, or has a monetary value of $5,000 or greater (that way you shield those who sell a gun to a friend or an acquaintance, thus protecting innocent people from persecution) then you get an automatic life sentence, which you'll serve out in forced work camps, being paid a slave's wage so you can pay a $3 million dollar fine that'll be brought against you.\n \n And for drug dealers, oh you're gonna love this one. If you're found to be in possession of both a gun and illegal drug paraphernalia, then after being found guilty you get shipped over to Iraq where the locals will dish out their own brand of punishment on you.\n \n \nI suggest mandatory safe storage laws. No gun safe in the house, no guns.\n\n \n Now it's your turn to make concessions. First, for such a law to be accepted it would have to be written in specific, precise language so there's no room for technical violations. The definition of \"safe storage\" and \"child proof\" and other such terms would have to be written in a manner that makes them easily obtainable in a realistic manner, and accessible to people of even the lowest income bracket so it doesn't automatically say \"if you're poor then it sucks to be you because it's now illegal for you to have a gun\".\n \n \nThen go after straw purchasers.\n\n \n Are you going to propose specific wording so innocent people aren't punished through technical fouls? A lot of people sometimes sell off pieces of their collection to help pay the bills, I don't see why they should be treated like the people selling illegal weapons caches out of the trunk of their cars down by the docks.\n \n \nGun used in a crime with no report of its theft on file?\n\n \n Is there going to be a strict oversight system to make sure that the police didn't \"misplace\" the theft report or claim that the call never came through, and severely punish them if they're found to be lax in their duties?\n \n \nProsecute the registered owner. Mandatory jail time.\n\n \n Even when it can be proven that the owner had no way of knowing about the theft before the police come to arrest him for his failure to report the loss? What if the owner in question is an elder gentlemen who's been confined to the hospital in intensive care because he was seriously injured in the break in, and the police found his gun being used by a criminal before the owner could get back home to know just what was taken?\n \n \nThen work with foreign gun manufacturers to smash gun smuggling operations. If the manufacturers won't cooperate, ban importation of their products.\n\n \n Even though in 1968 the Gun Control Act implemented a strict \"sporting purpose\" clause that banned the importation of firearms that were determined to have no purpose in a legitimate sporting use? We can't import AK-47s or SKS's or AR-15s, because the ATF doesn't classify them as sporting enough for importation. So what good is banning the importation of foreign manufacture going to do?\n \n Don't just be throwing out these general catchall terms.

If you ban guns, even as severely as England and Australia did, that will not reduce crime, violence and or the availability of guns for criminals. \n \n Drug dealers will just import in criminal's guns in with their already illegal product. Just like they do in England and Australia.\n \n England, 10 years after their draconian gun bans.\n   Weapons sell for just \u00a350 as suspects and victims grow ever younger \n Senior police officers have been warning for several months that a growing number of teenagers in big cities are becoming involved in gun crime. \n The age of victims and suspects has fallen over the past three years as the availability of firearms in some cities has risen. \n \"Illegal firearms have become increasingly accessible to younger offenders who appear more likely to use these firearms recklessly,\" a report on gun crime commissioned by the Home Office cautioned last year.\n\n \n   Shotguns for \u00a350: study reveals weapons culture  \n Sawn-off shotguns are still the weapon of choice for the more serious armed criminal and can now be bought illegally for between \u00a350 and \u00a3200, according to Home Office research. A purpose-built 9mm handgun, which is easier to conceal than a shotgun, is available for \u00a31,000-\u00a31,400 on the back streets of Britain while those wanting \"a gangster image\" can buy a  machine gun  for \u00a3800.\n Even though those interviewed were in prison, many still viewed gun crime as a \"viable career option\" enabling them to overcome their deprived backgrounds to secure wealth and status. One man from Greater Manchester claimed he had earned \u00a352,000 in a week from gun crime. The study shows that though Nottingham is dubbed Britain's gun crime capital, guns are far more available in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and London.\n\n   A DEADLY arsenal of high-powered weapons has disappeared from military barracks, The Sun can reveal. \n Cops believe most have ended up in the hands of organised crime gangs. A total of 109 guns have been lost or stolen in the last seven years. They include 54 high-velocity SA80 automatic assault rifles that can fire off 30 rounds in five seconds and are lethal from up to a kilometre away. \n\n \n \n Australia 10 years after their gun bans. \n Here is another report produced by Australian Institute of Criminology here called   Weapons, drugs and crime Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) \n \n And a article about is in the report here.\n Link  Australian Institute of Criminology study -- Tough new weapons laws 'miss hard core of criminal underworld' \nCANBERRA - The introduction of tough laws to control guns and knives appears to be failing to keep lethal weapons out of the hands of Australian criminals. .... reported that while new laws may have helped reduce the number of knives and guns in illicit circulation,  they have failed to deter hard-core criminals. It also pointed to a large firearms black market. \n\n \n   Captain 'stole anti-tank weapons' \n An Australian army captain and a former defence force officer who were allegedly behind a racket selling rocket launchers to criminals had talked about killing people who dobbed them in, a Sydney court has been told. \n \n It's alleged Della-Vedova, an ammunition technical officer, was the mastermind behind the racket, which allegedly on-sold ten M72 rocket launchers to the criminal underground. \n\n \n So before we start the taking of people's constitutionally recognized as Inalienable and therefore Constitutionally guaranteed Rights, lets make sure that gun control would be first, proven to work, and second, absolutely necessary.\n \n Crime will never be zero and one can always make the case that something needs to be done.\n \n So Just how logical is it to try and control crime by controlling the law abiding? That does not even make sense.",

Additionally, the associated federal regulations interpreting these laws are even larger. Minimum penalty for a violation is typically 5 years in federal prison for every offense.\n \n It is estimated that there are between 22,000 and 30,000 gun laws on the books in America. Those laws include restrictions on possession, carry, distribution, storage, transfer, manufacture, sale, ownership, importation, use and more. \n\n From the USDOJ \n   Serious violent crime levels remained will below levels of 10 years ago. \n \n And that is a real understatement.

   "Here is what we know about crime. Maybe this can help us generate good smart and effective crime fighting strategies. \n \n Gun Violence and Constitutional Issues \n The FBI statistics reveal that 75 percent of all violent crimes for any locality are committed by six percent of hardened criminals and repeat offenders.18 Violent crimes continue to be a problem in the inner cities with gangs involved in the drug trade.\n\n \n  Study done by the University of Tennessee Med school \nLooking only to official criminal records, data over the past thirty years consistently show that the mythology of murderers as ordinary citizens does not hold true. Studies have found that approximately 75% of murderers have adult criminal records, and that murderers average a prior adult criminal career of six years, including four major adult felony arrests. These studies also found that when the murder occurred [a]bout 11% of murder arrestees [were] actually on pre-trial release--that is, they were awaiting trial for another offense. \n \n The fact that only 75% of murderers have adult crime records should not be misunderstood as implying that the remaining 25% of murderers are non-criminals. The reason over half of those 25% of murderers don't have adult records is that they are juveniles. Thus, by definition they cannot have an adult criminal record. Juvenile criminal records might well show these murderers to have extensive serious criminal records. \n\n   Violence in America - Effective Solutions \n more than two-thirds of gun homicide \"victims\" are involved with drug trafficking or have evidence of ante-mortem illicit drug use.\n \n Not only do the data show that acquaintance and domestic homicide are a minority of homicides,[26] but the FBI's definition of acquaintance and domestic homicide requires only that the murderer knew or was related to the decedent. That dueling drug dealers are acquainted does not make them \"friends.\" Over three-quarters of murderers have long histories of violence against not only their enemies and other \"acquaintances,\" but also against their relatives.\n \n The gun control advocacy literature from the \"medical community\" shows that fully two-thirds of gun homicide \"victims\" are, in fact, drug dealers and their customers who wreak tremendous human and economic havoc upon society. In failing to account for this, the medical literature cannot and does not honestly assess these deaths.\" \n\n \n  FBI: Burgeoning gangs behind up to 80% of U.S. crime \nCriminal gangs in the USA have swelled to an estimated 1 million members responsible for up to 80% of crimes in communities across the nation, according to a gang threat assessment compiled by federal officials.\n \n The major findings in a report by the Justice Department's National Gang Intelligence Center, which has not been publicly released, conclude gangs are the \"primary retail-level distributors of most illicit drugs\" and several are \"capable\" of competing with major U.S.-based Mexican drug-trafficking organizations.\n \n \"A rising number of U.S.-based gangs are seemingly intent on developing working relationships\" with U.S. and foreign drug-trafficking organizations and other criminal groups to \"gain direct access to foreign sources of illicit drugs,\" the report concludes. \n\n \n   Crime factors from the FBI website \n Historically, the causes and origins of crime have been the subjects of investigation by many disciplines. Some factors that are known to affect the volume and type of crime occurring from place to place are:\n \n \u00b7 Population density and degree of urbanization. \n \u00b7 Variations in composition of the population, particularly youth concentration. \n \u00b7 Stability of population with respect to residents' mobility, commuting patterns, and transient factors. \n \u00b7 Modes of transportation and highway system. \n \u00b7 Economic conditions, including median income, poverty level, and job availability. \n \u00b7 Cultural factors and educational, recreational, and religious characteristics. \n \u00b7 Family conditions with respect to divorce and family cohesiveness. \n \u00b7 Climate. \n \u00b7 Effective strength of law enforcement agencies. \n \u00b7 Administrative and investigative emphases of law enforcement. \n \u00b7 Policies of other components of the criminal justice system (i.e., prosecutorial, judicial, correctional, and probational). \n \u00b7 Citizens' attitudes toward crime. \n \u00b7 Crime reporting practices of the citizenry. \n \n",

It would be nice to reduce the number of shootings in this country.\n\n \n How many drive by shootings have taken place in the strict gun control state of Illinois?

Having 300,000 isn't going to work any better if current trends remain the same. You could have a death penalty punishment for being a felon in possession of a firearm, but if the courts drop the possession charge then it does absolutely no good.\n \n \nTo impede their easy access to hardware.\n\n \n Such a notion hasn't worked in the past, it's not working in the present, it's not going to work in the future.

   "What percentage of fatal crimes involved a firearm?\n\n Who commits murder? and who should we be looking to control? \n \n   Murder in Families \n Seventy-four percent of murder defendants had a prior criminal record of arrest or conviction for a crime. A substantial percentage of murder victims, 44%, also had a prior criminal record. However, 19% of family murder victims had a prior record, compared to 51% of nonfamily murder victims. Also, 56% of family murder defendants, compared to 77% of other murder defendants, had a prior record.\n\n \n  Study done by the University of Tennessee Med school \nLooking only to official criminal records, data over the past thirty years consistently show that the mythology of murderers as ordinary citizens does not hold true. Studies have found that approximately 75% of murderers have adult criminal records, and that murderers average a prior adult criminal career of six years, including four major adult felony arrests. These studies also found that when the murder occurred [a]bout 11% of murder arrestees [were] actually on pre-trial release--that is, they were awaiting trial for another offense. \n \n The fact that only 75% of murderers have adult crime records should not be misunderstood as implying that the remaining 25% of murderers are non-criminals. The reason over half of those 25% of murderers don't have adult records is that they are juveniles. Thus, by definition they cannot have an adult criminal record. Juvenile criminal records might well show these murderers to have extensive serious criminal records. \n\n \n   FBI: Burgeoning gangs behind up to 80% of U.S. crime  to include murder.\n \n England has a lot more gun control than you are calling for. Did that reduce the number of murders, or did it just help to leave victims even more helpless?\n England Murder rate. \n \n   KNIFINGS AND SHOOTINGS UP AS MURDER RATE SOARS \n THERE has been a huge increase in being people shot, stabbed and even kicked to death since Labour came to power. Shocking statistics released last night show a 14 per cent increase in murder and manslaughter in England and Wales between 1998 and 2007.\n \n There was also a 28 per cent increase in deaths from bladed weapons. Those killed by shootings increased by the same figure. Most shockingly, there was a 57 per cent increase in deaths caused by punching and kicking.\n\n \n So how is controlling the law-abiding going to help when murder is already illegal, it is already illegal for a convicted criminal to be even in the same room as a gun.

Instead, these storage requirements appear to impair people's ability to use guns defensively. Because accidental shooters also tend to be the ones most likely to violate the new law, safe storage laws increase violent and property crimes against low risk citizens with no observable offsetting benefit in terms of reduced accidents or suicides. .... \n \n During the first five full years after the passage of the safe storage laws, the group of fifteen states that adopted these laws faced an annual average increase of over 300 more murders, 3,860 more rapes, 24,650 more robberies, and over 25,000 more aggravated assaults.

Or if your insurance company will not insure you because you live in a high crime neighborhood. You are in violation of the Law! Go to Jail and have your 2nd Amendment protected weapons confiscated? Good way to deal with crime. Make criminals out of the law-abiding, and jail them! emoticon_xdonno After all, the law-abiding are so much easier to catch! emoticon_smile",

   "First, let me apologize: it's taken me a while to write this. I've been busy with group projects in my last semester and dealing with some horrible sickness that (apparently,) everyone near me has as well! Bleh. \n \n Second, I would like to say that I will follow the rules of this forum, to the letter, to the best of my abilities. I will apologize in the event that I make an inappropriate statement and correct it posthaste. emoticon_emb \n \n Third, I will not 'argue,' 'get defensive,' or start calling people 'nut cases,' 'paranoid,' or 'insecure,' and insulting them because they don't feel the way I do. (Now, before I'm lambasted and told, \"It's not about feelings, it's about facts,\" that's an entirely different subject, and I'm not going to discuss it right now.)\n \n As far as the 9/11 tragedy goes: for the sake of example, if citizens were allowed to carry a firearm on a plane (of course granting the use of frangible rounds so as not to 'depressurize' the cabin,) and an armed citizen pulled out a loaded 1911, and pointed it at a terrorist holding a box cutter... The phrase \"Don't bring a knife to a gun fight,\" rings a bell. So does, \"I hope I brought fresh underwear.\" :p Sadly, it didn't happen that way. (However, I'm left to wonder why Air Marshals carry pistols, then? If pistols carried by a trained civilian wouldn't make a difference, how would one carried by an LEO make any difference?)\n \n Enough blabbering. Now, onto my (probably brief, and more than likely disjointed,) discussion.\n \n Attending a university makes it abundantly clear where many other young people stand on many issues. Four years have I attended this school and not a day goes by where I don't hear the incessant chest-thumping of people out to prove that \"My way best! Unga bunga!\" The words may be different, but I still get that same droning in my ears... Between the \"You're going to Hell for drinking and partying,\" and \"Bush lied, people died,\" folks, I think I'm developing tinnitus. :p \n \n \nBut we don't have a polite society.\n Ahhh! The miracle of subjectivity, friend! :) (Taken even deeper - perception is reality. Or is it? A:\"The sky is blue.\" B:\"Oh? Prove it.\" I'll not discuss the 'burden of proof fallacy,' here. It's irrelevant... for now.) However, in this situation (and others like it,) know that the burden of proof almost always rests with those who are trying to affirm a point - those who claim the existence of something. (\"Guns kill people.\" \"Guns are evil.\" See the comment about the sky earlier in this post...) That magic word 'belief,' is huge. \nWe have millions of guns and many, many shootings.\n I'll agree with the first part, but the second, '...many, many shootings,' is quantified by emotions and is also open to interpretation. Emotions are fine and wonderful, but interpretation is the difficult part. An example: I have many, many vinyl records. A music store has many, many vinyl records... I'm an avid collector, but I'm not rich. :wink: The \"...many, many shootings,\" part will be decided by each person. (Though that might make me sound callous, it's true.) \nMost crimes are committed with late model weapons manufactured in the USA. Something like 3 yrs old or less.\n Proof was requested, this horse has been beaten. ;) However, I don't think it matters much, though. Splitting hairs, really. A villain could shoot someone dead just as easily with six rounds from a cap and ball Colt... or he could stab them twelve times with a screwdriver. \nAny hope of changing these statistics will require some concessions from gun enthusiasts.\n I think everyone (except the the evil and the violently insane,) want less innocent deaths. Concessions have been, (and are being,) given. (As if Americans had or have a choice in the matter. :( ) [By the way, thanks for saying 'enthusiast,' and not some other derisive term. emoticon_xgood I've only received one reply from you and it was both courteous and conducive to discussion.] The first big stroke of this brush was the National Firearms Act (1934) and continued with the second stroke of the Gun Control Act of 1968. Numerous other laws have been implemented. Someone else has posted links to the full texts of the federal laws, but if they don't work, I'll find some that do. The federal laws themselves are voluminous. That doesn't include state and local laws. I believe it's been said, \"The problem is in enforcing the laws we already have - not making new ones.\" For that, one needs to talk to law enforcement and ask them \"Why aren't you enforcing the laws?\" \nWhat are any of you prepared to suggest? I suggest mandatory safe storage laws. No gun safe in the house, no guns.\n Interesting suggestion. Now, my guns are secured safely unless they are in my hands, on my hip(s,) or within a space where I can grab them nearly instantly. Locks can be defeated and metal can be cut. While this may help deter casual thefts: (\"Oh, look at this locked pistol case under the jewelry chest that is unsecured to any hard object. I'll take it ALONG with the rings and necklaces!\") However, I've been unable to find anything that quantifies the number of guns that are stolen in 'casual' thefts, as compared to more elaborate ones, so my talking points end here for now. However, I'm left wondering about \"mandatory sentencing.\" Those two words are a slippery, steep slope. (Think drug laws, among others.) If someone is intent on stealing something, they'll do whatever they can to get it into their hands. The same goes for killing. If Thug A wants Thug B dead, he'll get it done. By pistol, shank, screwdriver, or a 2-ton killing machine that anyone 16 and up can drive, so long as they can barely understand some basic English and can memorize some street signs. \nThen go after straw purchasers. Gun used in a crime with no report of its theft on file? Prosecute the registered owner. Mandatory jail time.\n Another interesting suggestion, though troubled by the same \"mandatory sentencing,\" catch. Let judges judge... Determine if the individual(s) in question, are guilty of culpable negligence. If the judges aren't trusted to do that, then find someone else who can be trusted. \nThen work with foreign gun manufacturers to smash gun smuggling operations. If the manufacturers won't cooperate, ban importation of their products.\n Very good suggestion. Anyone who deals with gun smuggling should be tried as such. ... Well, they already are, but you get the point. Hmmm. Maybe I'm not reading into your statement correctly... emoticon_frazzled\n \n \nLimiting the expression of certain freedoms does not constitute persecution in my book. Your RKBA is not unlimited and has never been so.\n I won't deal with the second part, as I'm not an expert on Constitutional Law, nor was I around and discussing the Bill of Rights with the folks who made it. (... Too bad, huh? That would have been amazing!) However, the first part is interesting. This is my opinion: Limiting freedoms is unconscionable, regardless of which one(s.) Your freedom ends when it starts encroaching upon mine. (Preferably before, but that's splitting hairs.)\n \n I heard this quote: \"They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.\" How do you feel about that? (The royal \"you.\")\n \n I also heard this one: \"It's okay to limit freedoms so long as they're the ones you disagree with...\" Is that true? Does anyone here believe that? I sure don't. I may abhor the disgracing of flags (of any nation,) but it's considered freedom of speech, and as such, it should be protected...It should be protected just as much as the speech of members of the Aryan Nation or the Black Panthers proclaiming their beliefs...\n \n Too bad our country's founders forgot the word, \"and,\" from the Second Amendment. It would certainly make things different. ;) \n \n Cheers, friends.\n emoticon_xhoho",

   "My personal opinion on the \"anti-gun self-image\" is that they believe that people in society cannot be trusted. I disagree. For the most part, our society are law-abiding and \"polite.\" Having a gun is just a re-assurance or rather, an insurance that enables those law-abiding citizens the ability to defend themselves when someone who maybe is bigger or stronger than them is trying to kill or hurt them. The police (see Warren vs. Washington DC) have no obligation to protect you, stop or prevent crimes. The consequences of removing guns or severely limiting them to a select few will back fire tremendously. Why do I say this? I use prohibition as an example. Crime rates went up, they gave birth to the mafia, who were responsible for the huge numbers of killings in those days, safe to say that it was a complete and utter disaster. If guns went the same route, it would make it easier for criminals to rob, steal, murder, etc. The anti-gunners would say \"well at least they don't have guns..\" really? We border two countries one of which is quite corrupt, what makes you think that criminals can't get guns. Even without the guns, criminals would just resort to the next available weapon, knives and swords. Nothing has changed. Crime is still happening, just with a different weapon. Ever seen someone hacked to pieces? It's a lot more gruesome than a bullet hole I'll tell you that. Then what comes next? Banning knives (see the UK)? Then what? Clubs and bats? Boy we sure are a safe society...we just about practically banned everything, but it's ok. As long as we feel safe. The reality I think most people who think this way is this. It's better to be safe than sorry. I ever comes the day you need something like a gun to protect yourself from harm, you'll see what I mean. It's quite a horrible feeling to feel helpless. To not be able to do something to stop someone from hurting someone else. I wish I had a gun that one day some sick b****** was beating the #### out of this woman. I could have at least just stopped that guy from inflicting more pain. The police? They were 30 minutes late.",
