   "Around midnight, two men armed with a shotgun and a pistol entered Larry's Game Room in Atascosa County, Texas. One of the robbers fired into the air and pointed a gun at a female employee, forcing her to the floor. The owner retrieved his .40-caliber pistol and emerged from a back room. The owner fired at the criminals, killing one and causing the other to flee.\n \n The police do not plan to charge the owner. (WOAI San Antonio, Texas 04/02/09)\n \n From the Akron Beacon Journal of April 1, 2009\n Pizza shop owner describes robbery, shooting \n \n John Hayes wants only to sell pizzas, not shoot robbers.\n \n But the day after his West Akron pizza parlor was held up and he shot and killed the shotgun-armed robber, Hayes remains concerned about his business, his life and the health of his six workers.\n \n He wants the public to know why he opened fire: He didn't want to be killed, like other robbery victims around the city. He wants only to sell pizzas.\n \n ''I'm devastated,'' he said inside Your Pizza Shop, the West Exchange Street parlor he purchased two months ago. ''It's an unbelievable situation I've been put into because of some person's carelessness and thoughtlessness.\n \n ''I'm in fear of my life, my employees' lives and the lives of everybody I know.''\n \n Hayes, 37, was behind the counter Tuesday night when 20-year-old Patrick Finney, wearing an orange ski mask, walked in and pointed a sawed-off shotgun at his head just before 8 p.m.\n \n A customer, an older woman from the neighborhood, was seated at the counter watching the Cavaliers game while waiting for a stromboli.\n \n ''He said, 'Give me the [expletive] money. This is an [expletive] robbery,'' Hayes said.\n \n Hayes cooperated, giving the robber a stack of $10 bills. The robber wanted more and pointed the shotgun within inches of Hayes' head, he said.\n \n ''As soon as I gave him the money, I pulled my gun out from my hip, pointed it and fired four shots,'' Hayes said.\n \n Finney fell to the floor, then stood back up. Hayes fired three more shots from his Smith & Wesson 9 mm pistol. Finney staggered outside and collapsed across the street. The cash he sought was dropped outside.\n \n Hayes then called 911.\n \n ''I just got robbed at my pizza shop, 1077 West Exchange Street,'' Hayes says on the recording released by Akron police.\n \n ''OK, what kind. . . .does he have a weapon?'' a dispatcher asks.\n \n ''He had a weapon, a gun. I shot him. He's across the street laying down right now,'' Hayes says.\n \n ''You shot him?'' the dispatcher replies in a startled voice.\n \n ''I shot him right in front of me while he was holding a gun on me,'' Hayes replies.\n \n Finney was taken to Akron General Medical Center. He died within the hour. An autopsy on Wednesday showed he was shot multiple times in the torso. The death has been ruled a homicide.\n \n Akron police are investigating the shooting, but there is no indication that Hayes, who has been questioned by investigators, acted unlawfully. It was the fourth robbery at the shop since 2007.\n \n Police Lt. Rick Edwards said Finney had no felony convictions, but he had been arrested in 2008 and charged with marijuana drug abuse. Finney failed to appear in court and a warrant was issued for his arrest.\n \n Finney's mother, Patricia, lives six blocks south of Buchtel High School on Winton Avenue, but a neighbor said that Patrick Finney had lived with his grandmother until she died a few years ago. Efforts to reach other family members for comment were unsuccessful.\n \n An acquaintance of Finney, Kenneth Amos, 20, of Akron, was arrested after the shooting and charged with tampering with evidence. He had items that belonged to Finney, Edwards said. Police would not say whether the items were connected to the robbery.\n \n Hayes said the neighborhood reaction to the shooting has been troubling. A woman stood outside his shop taking pictures, for no apparent reason. Others have called and hung up. Business was slow Wednesday afternoon.\n \n His delivery drivers are concerned about retaliation. He said he carries a weapon, with a concealed carry permit and regular shooting practice, to avoid being a victim. He cited the recent case of the North Hill man shot in a carjacking as reason for his fear of being shot during a robbery.\n \n From the Orlando Sentinel of April 1, 2009\n Orange Blossom Trail pharmacist kills armed robber\n \n A pharmacist shot an armed robber dead Tuesday at a drugstore off South Orange Blossom Trail, the Orange County Sheriff's Office said.\n \n It was at least the fourth time this year that a robber was killed at a Central Florida business and was the second drugstore holdup that ended in death.\n \n The shooting happened about 5:15 p.m. at JR Pharmacy, 2160 Whispering Lakes Blvd.\n \n The man came into the shop with a handgun and, after a brief confrontation, was shot to death, sheriff's spokesman Jim Solomons said. Investigators would not release names, where the body was found or what the man tried to steal.\n \n The drugstore caters to the heavily Hispanic clientele in the neighborhood, customer Evette Luciano said.\n \n \"They're very honest people,\" she said of the owners.\n \n \"They go out of their way to help the customers,\" said her twin sister, Jeanette Luciano, who also lives nearby.\n \n Evette Luciano said she spoke to one of the partner's wives and was told that the shooting happened in the front of the store while two owners were in the back. The worker who did the shooting formerly worked across the street at Walgreens, customers said.\n \n Several customers said they thought three partners owned the store, including the man who shot the robber.\n \n But corporate documents show only two names. Neither man was the shooter, Evette Luciano said. Reached at home, Joshua Adedoyin and Rojer Tewari would not comment. They are listed on documents as \"managing members\" of the business.\n \n There was another armed robbery at JR Pharmacy in April 2007, Solomons said. There are no laws preventing people from defending themselves with guns at home or at work.\n \n \"The Legislature has empowered people to protect themselves,\" said sheriff's Cmdr. Paul \"Spike\" Hopkins. \"People are tired of being victims.\"\n \n There have been 25 calls to law enforcement from JR Pharmacy since 2003, but most were routine, Solomons said. Details were not immediately available, and it's not clear when the shop opened.\n \n On Feb. 7, a security guard shot and killed an armed robber at The Medicine Shoppe in New Smyrna Beach. Investigators said the guard, a retired law-enforcement officer, was justified. The robber had pointed a gun at a pharmacist and demanded oxycodone pills.\n \n In January, a customer at a carwash on South Orange Blossom Trail shot a suspected robber dead. The same week, a customer shot to death a man who police said was trying to rob a Kangaroo Express in Ocoee.",

The robber brandished a handgun and ordered the people inside the center to \"Gimme what you got.\" One of the AA visitors, who is also a Right-To-Carry permit holder, drew his gun and fired at the armed criminal, striking him multiple times, ending the robbery.

   "Shootout in upscale Palm City neighborhood leaves homeowner, suspect wounded\n By Joe Crankshaw (Contact)\n Thursday, April 16, 2009 \n \n \n PALM CITY - Linda Smyth was in her Lake Village home off Mapp Road about 9 a.m. Thursday when she heard gunshots coming from her neighbors' home.\n \n She went outside and saw Linda Schultz Russo, 47, in the yard. She was calling 911 on her cell phone and bleeding from a neck wound.\n \n \"Nothing like this has ever happened here,\" Smyth said.\n \n She put a towel on the wound to help stop the blood flow, and made Russo lie down to wait for paramedics. Russo was airlifted to the trauma center at St. Mary's Medical Center in West Palm Beach, where she was said to be in good condition late Thursday.\n \n Smyth said Russo told her Christopher Bruce Reber, 23, broke into her home by firing a shotgun through the back door.\n \n Russo grabbed her .40-caliber pistol and fired back, Smyth said, adding Russo said she thought she injured him.\n \n Reber was a former employee of Brooklyn Joe's Pizza on Dixie Highway in Stuart, operated by Joe and Linda Russo, Smyth said.\n \n A witness saw Reber flee the scene in a black Ford and followed him. The witness, who has not been identified by the Martin County Sheriff's Office, used her cell phone to tell lawmen a description of the car, its license number and Reber.\n \n She followed him into Stuart over the Palm City Bridge, but lost sight of him on Indian Street, sheriff's officials said.\n \n Deputies searched for the car, which later appeared in the Sheriff's Office parking lot.\n \n Rhonda Irons, Martin County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman, said it was driven there by a Reber family member who told deputies Reber was at the Suburban Extended Stay Hotel in downtown Stuart. The family member said Reber had at least three bullet wounds.\n \n Deputies and members of the Stuart Fire/Rescue Service found Reber at the hotel bleeding from several wounds. He was flown to St. Mary's trauma center where he was listed in critical condition Thursday night. Federal Highway in the middle of Stuart was briefly closed so the helicopter could land and pick up Reber about 11:30 a.m. Thursday.\n \n No charges have been announced against anyone involved in the incident as of Thursday afternoon, but Reber is being held under arrest at the hospital on a warrant for forgery out of St. Lucie County, Irons said.\n \n Smyth, president of the Lake Village Home Owners Association, said the Russos have lived in the 96-unit community for about five years and are well-liked.\n \n \"I am ecstatic that she fought back and am very proud of her,\" Smyth said. She said many people in the community have weapons for defense, but until now no one has had to use them.",

   "Botetourt home intruder likely drunk, police say\n By Amanda Codispoti\n \n The sister of a man who was fatally shot after breaking into a Botetourt County home said Tuesday that she believes her brother was drunk and confused about where he was.\n \n Jerry Lee Jones Jr.'s blood-alcohol content was more than four times the legal limit for driving when he died, Botetourt County Sheriff Ronnie Sprinkle said Tuesday.\n \n Jody Hoover, 46, shot and killed the 35-year-old Jones after Jones broke into the Hoover family's house in the Nace area of the county Friday night.\n \n Commonwealth's Attorney Joel Branscom and the sheriff's office reviewed the evidence, including the recording of a 911 call made by Hoover, and decided not to charge the homeowner, according to a news release from the sheriff's office.\n \n Authorities didn't release the men's names until Tuesday because Jones' identity had to be confirmed through fingerprints and Hoover was still under investigation, Branscom said.\n \n Jones' sister, Margaret Jones, said he had been depressed and was drinking because Friday was their late father's birthday.\n \n Jones was in a vehicle with a friend, Joe Harper, but when Jones became violent, the friend dropped him off near the Hoover home, the news release said.\n \n Harper lived in the area, and Margaret Jones said she believes her brother thought he was at Harper's house when he was banging on the Hoovers' door.\n \n \"I'm sorry for the family, but I don't think he went there to hurt them,\" she said. \"He couldn't have known what he was doing.\"\n \n In the 911 recording, Jody Hoover calls the sheriff's office and tells a dispatcher that there is a \"strange man outside our home, and he's hollerin' and he's crying out. I don't know what's going on with him.\"\n \n Hoover hands the phone to his wife while he gets his double-barreled, 12-gauge shotgun.\n \n Jones can be heard yelling and repeatedly banging on the back sliding glass door.\n \n Hoover's wife tells the dispatcher that the man is talking about Vietnam and 1969, and that he asked Jody Hoover for the date.\n \n Hoover talks to the man from inside. \"I don't want to hurt you,\" he says. \"I can't let you in.\n \n \"Please, just go away. Please.\"\n \n About seven and a half minutes after Hoover calls 911, Jones shatters the glass door with a wrought-iron chair and tries to come in.\n \n Hoover told authorities that he shot at Jones twice. Deputies arrived at the house as the shots were fired. Jones was pronounced dead at Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital.\n \n Jones lived about two miles from the Hoovers but did not know them, Sprinkle said. \n \n In 2005, Jones was found guilty in Botetourt County of brandishing a firearm and in 1999 and 2000 he was found guilty in Roanoke County of driving under the influence.\n \n Hoover's mother-in-law and two sons were also at the house.",

He heard the window go up and saw a man coming in.\n \n \"He stuck his hand under and pulled the blinds back, the blinds and the curtain,\" he said. \"And he eased in like he was attempting to come in.\n \n \"I fired two shots, then he ran off,\" Snigg said.\n \n Police say they won't identify the woman or her son, who offered the nickname Snigg, for fear of retribution.\n \n Javorous Darnell Tims, 20, ran about 80 feet from the window, fell to the sidewalk and died of a single gunshot wound, police said Friday.\n \n Pascagoula police said Snigg and his mother acted appropriately, \"taking the actions they felt necessary to protect themselves.\" However, because a man died, the case will be presented to a grand jury for review.\n \n Tims, who had at one time lived in apartments not far away, was a familiar face in the parking lot of the Granada Apartments, according to Dustin Clarke, 22, who handles maintenance and courtesy security at the apartments.\n \n Not many people in the complex heard the shots, said Clarke, who was at the scene when police investigated the shooting and talked with residents and investigators.\n \n Clarke said Tims had gotten his head through the window when Snigg fired the first shot and missed. That shot hit the wall under the window, Clarke said. By the time Snigg fired the second shot, Tims had turned. The bullet went through Tims' upper body, he said.\n \n \"The blinds were down.
