   "DAY OF DECISION ACTIONS TUESDAY NIGHT!!\n \n We have just learned that the California Supreme Court will announce\n its decision on Proposition 8 Tuesday, May 26th. If it follows past\n practice, the court will make its announcement at about 10 AM Pacific\n Time (1 PM, Eastern / 12 noon Central).\n \n Please plan on participating in the Day of Decision action in your\n city tomorrow night - go to DayOfDecision.com - Celebration OR Protest on the California Supreme Court DAY OF DECISION on Prop 8 to see the time and\n place of your local action. Even more important - please forward this\n message to every list serve you can. Facebook it, twitter it, phone\n it - and be there!\n \n Depending on what the court decides, we will either PROTEST or\n CELEBRATE.\n \n We will PROTEST if:\n \n -- The court upholds Prop 8, and invalidates the 18,000 same-sex\n marriage licenses that California already issued;\n \n or,\n \n -- The court upholds Prop 8, but upholds the 18,000 same-sex\n marriages already performed, which would be a cruel, but phyrric\n victory for equality.\n \n We will CELEBRATE if:\n \n -- The court rejects Proposition 8 and says that same-sex couples are\n entitled to the marriage rights that heterosexual couples already\n have.\n \n So call, email, Facebook, Twitter your friends \n \n \n So It's finally here. Like I said I'll be in West Hollywood at 7pm to rally. If you want to come to a rally look up the Day Of Decision webpage to find a city hosting a rally in your area. Please come out and support marriage equality and ensure that out voice is heard.",

In other words, with the 14th amendment, the constitution placed limits on the state's power to pass laws that discriminate against people who are in the minority. \n\n \n As Steeeeve pointed out,... the 14th was about equal \"protection\" not treatment. There's a significant difference and it's evident that you are trying as best you can to use the two terms interchangeably. \n \n \nThe question of when a state can discriminate in service of the general welfare has been a matter decided by the Supreme Court over time since the ratification of the amendment.

This runs afoul of the 14th amendment. See the majority ruling in Romer v. Evans. \n\n \n And again, I'll note that being treated with indifference (as the country has treated gay partnerships for over 200 years) is not tantamount to discrimination. There is no animus in recognizing the one man one woman template for \"marriage\" even to the exclusion of all other relationships. It really is that simple.\n \n \n You make an argument that states should be allowed to discriminate against gay people in marriage because of the longstanding tradition of opposite-sex marriage. But legalization of same-sex marriage does nothing to undermine or harm or limit opposite-sex marriage. \n\n \n Strawman alert !!!\n \n I never suggested anything of the sort. And I certainly never claimed that gay marriage \"harms\" heterosexual unions. There are forum rules against intentionally mischaracterizing another's views,... and I'll thank you not to do it again.\n \n \n Indeed, legalizing same-sex marriage supports the purposes of marriage as an institution, by providing protection for families and children.

There is no rational basis for states to deny same-sex marriage; the only reason states do so is out of animus toward gay people.\n\n \n I don't profess to speak for anyone other than myself. I see that the government has the right to define marriage as it sees fit to meet the general welfare needs of the nation and to recognize that definition on that basis,... even to the exclusion of all the other kinds of human relationships. \"Indifference is not discrimination.\"\n \n \n The reason is anti-gay prejudice, not any rational protection of opposite-sex marriage, which same-sex marriage does not threaten. \n\n \n That's your opinion. And no matter how strongly fely, that doesn't make it fact.\n \n \n The issue here is not whether gay people \"feel\" violated or discriminated against under the law. We ARE discriminated against under the law in most states. It's objectively true, not a matter of \"feeling.\"\n \n Since 1996, with the passage of the federal DOMA law, states have rushed to pass their own DOMA laws, explicitly to prohibit same-sex marriage where the state laws were previously silent on this question.

A \"prohibition\" if you will. When in fact, there is no such prohibition taking place. Gay's can still share their lives, have marriage which are not recognized, civil unions and the like. \n \n Gay unions are simply not as pertinent to the \"general welfare\" of the nation that heterosexual relationships are. And seeing as the government is only charged with promoting the \"general\" welfare and NOT the \"recognition of all unions equally,\" it seems the government has the authority to exercise discretion as to what is and what is not in keeping with the \"general welfare\" needs of the nation.",

They are based on animus against gay people. That's clear. The people who have pushed through these laws have nothing positive or even neutral to say about gay people. Remember also that these same anti-gay activists railed against civil unions no less intensely than they have raised against same-sex marriage. Remember the howling by anti-gay activists when Vermont instituted civil unions. Now that civil unions have become reality in some places, after much struggle, some people who oppose same-sex marriage say, \"Why can't you just accept civil unions? You don't need equality under the law. Why can't civil unions be enough? How dare you demand to be treated as equals?\"\n \n The issue is not whether the laws banning same-sex marriage prevent our relationships. They don't. They prevent us from having legal marriages. The Supreme Court struck down the legal prohibitions against same-sex relations in 2003, in Lawrence v. Texas. Note that the laws have not been indifferent to gay relationships for many years; the laws have been repressive and punitive toward gay people for many years. It's been only recently that these repressive and punitive laws have been struck down as unconstitutional or else swept away legislatively because they were simple expressions of animus. Laws have been gradually changed in a positive direction because gay people stood up and spoke out and fought for change. \n \n Same-sex marriages do benefit society as a whole, no less than opposite-sex marriages do. Marriage is marriage; there is no difference between opposite-sex marriage and same-sex marriage. Same-sex couples raise children together, and there is no rational reason to deny same-sex couples or the children of same-sex couples the protections that come from legal marriage. There is no rational basis for such discrimination against our families, and the discrimination against our children is harmful to them. As a parent, I know the importance of legal protections for our children.",

   "\n \n Strawman alert !!!\n \n I never suggested anything of the sort. [That states should be able to discriminate against same-sex couples in marriage laws because of the longstanding nature of opposite-sex marriage.] And I certainly never claimed that gay marriage \"harms\" heterosexual unions. There are forum rules against intentionally mischaracterizing another's views,... and I'll thank you not to do it again.\n\n \n I have never intentionally mischaracterized your views. I repeated what I understood your statements to mean, so I could respond to what you seemed to be saying. If I did not understand what you were saying, then you should clarify what you meant and what I misunderstood, not leap to the attack. I cannot read your mind, and I don't always know exactly what you meant. That's why we dialogue, so we explain our points and come to understand each other's points. \n \n It sounded to me like you were saying that states have the power to discriminate by banning same-sex marriages because opposite-sex marriage has existed for a long time and has been of benefit to society. My argument back to this is that this is not a rational basis for states to be able to discriminate against persons. Same-sex marriages do no harm to society or to opposite-sex marriages. And same-sex marriages benefit society in the same way that opposite-sex marriages do. \n \n States do not have the power to enact any discriminatory laws they want to. As I have said before, that's what the 14th amendment was enacted for: to prevent states from passing laws that deny to persons the equal protection of the laws. (I won't get into due process, because that will get me tangled up with Steeeve again over substantive due process, which we have discussed pretty much to death in the past. I also won't get into the privileges and immunities clause which has been largely devoid of significance since the Slaughterhouse Cases....the Supreme Court de-fanged the clause. Some have suggested it may be revived, but we'll see.) State power to enact laws is not absolute, just as individual rights are not absolute.",

   "Steeve, why are we splitting hairs over this one? How can you \"provide\" something without \"promoting\" it?\n No no no. You miss my point. Think of the second amendment. It says in order to have a militia the people need the right to bear arms. With the logic you applied to article 8 you would have concluded the right is to have a militia and the militia can bear arms. Now this article says they can collect taxes in order to provide for the common defense and general welfare. This gives a right to collect taxes with examples of uses. General welfare is not defined and not the purpose of that provision. General welfare only means what specific rights give it. This is reinforced by the 10th amendment. So Article 8 says \"you can collect taxes to pay for the things you are allowed to do\". It does not say \"you can do whatever is needed for the general welfare of the united states\" ie promote.",

In enacting laws that discriminated against African Americans, states insisted that they were doing so for the general welfare. The 14th amendment was aimed at stopping that practice, at putting limits on what laws the states could pass that denied equal treatment to persons. And yes, I mean equal treatment....most of the time.\nThe discrimination laws were invalid based on substance over form. In form they were \"equal protection\" because in reality and substance they never were and never could be. It is inherently unequal protection.

   "Today we can expect the ruling by the California supreme court on Proposition 8. I expect them to rule that the constitutional amendment stands, that it is an amendment, not a revision to the state constitution. I may be wrong, of course. If they rule that the amendment stands, then the supporters of marriage equality will have to mobilize voters again to overturn the amendment. \n \n The other issue of great importance is what happens to the marriages that were performed in the brief months when same-sex marriage was legal in California. Are the people who married legally in that time still married under California law? Or are their marriages now dissolved? I certainly hope, and I think, that the state supreme court will rule that these marriages are still in effect, and these couples are still legally married in California. \n \n This would lead to the odd scenario of some same-sex couples being legally married and others being unable to marry. But marriage laws have led to weird legal scenarios before and in other kinds of circumstances. For example, I know a couple here in Ohio in which one of the spouses is formerly a woman who had a sex change and became a man. He is legally married to his female spouse. In Ohio, a birth certificate cannot be changed, and a transgender person who was born physically a woman cannot become legally a man and marry a woman. However, in this couple's case the marriage took place in another state where birth certificates can be changed and where a marriage between an FTM transgender person and a woman is legal. The couple in this other state when they were married, and the birth certificate was changed. They later moved to Ohio. So, what is their legal situation in Ohio? It's not clear. Is their marriage legal in Ohio? The Ohio state constitution explicitly disallows same-sex marriage. Ohio also does not recognize sex changes as legal. It would appear that Ohio would not recognize this couple's marriage as legal, since under Ohio law the couple would be a same-sex couple, not an opposite-sex couple, and therefore, their marriage in the other state would be regarded as invalid in Ohio. But the couple has never had reason to announce to the state that one spouse is transgender. The state has not moved to dissolve or to refuse to recognize their marriage. They go quietly along being legally married, because no one has challenged the legality of their marriage. I am not sure if they get federal benefits and rights of marriage. I think they do, but I'm not sure. I think that the federal government accepted the change of birth certificate and the legality of their marriage in the previous state. But could this come under challenge if, say, one spouse were to die and the other were to seek Social Security survivors' benefits? It might not be an issue; the other spouse might simply receive the benefits so long as no one were to challenge the legality of their marriage. But someone might challenge it, and then what would the federal government do? Would the federal recognition of their marriage depend on whether Ohio recognized their marriage? Or would federal recognition of their marriage depend on the recognition by their previous home state where they were legally married?\n \n I also know a same-sex couple that is legally married here in Ohio because one spouse is a male-to-female transgender person. Under Ohio law, she is still a man, and so the two women were allowed to get married legally in Ohio because the state regards the transgender woman as forever a man and therefore as eligible to marry a woman.",

That's another can of worms we could open, though I would prefer not to here. \n \n I agree with you that the 14th amendment is not a federal government can do anything amendment. It's a states cannot do anything they want amendment.\n \n On your last point, the 14th amendment was NOT written to apply exclusively to race. It was written in broad language, and it refers to \"persons\" and \"citizens.\" This was intentional on the part of its framers. They did not intend the amendment to apply exclusively to race. In contrast, the framers did intend the 15th amendment to apply exclusively to race, color, and previous condition of servitude and they said so in the amendment, much to the chagrin of women's rights activists, who were very upset that the Republicans did not include \"sex\" in the amendment. You probably know this, but I add the historical background for others who may read our discussion. I know you get annoyed when I supply historical background because you apparently regard this as me talking down to you or something, which is not my intention. \n \n As for the marriage issue, one can argue that in most states a man cannot marry another man no matter what he does. It's discrimination in substance. In form, a man can marry someone, but he can never marry the person he wants to marry. The form of the law appears to be equal, but in substance the law is discriminatory. \n \n In Loving v. Virginia, the Commonwealth of Virginia argued, as you do here, that the law applied equally to everyone, and a black man could marry a black woman whom he didn't love; he just couldn't marry a white woman. But he could get married. Virginia lost on that argument in the Supreme Court. The Court ruled, in effect, that the form of the law was equal but not the substance of the law. This is likewise true of the laws banning same-sex marriage, as I have explained in the previous paragraph. \n \n As for the arguments regarding segregated schools, proponents of segregation did argue that a black child could go to school; he or she just couldn't go to a white school. They argued, as you do in the same-sex marriage cases, that there was no denial of equal protection because the black children were not denied the right to go to school. They just couldn't go to the school they wanted to attend, as a gay person today in most states cannot marry the person he wants to marry. In my view, both are discrimination, because even though the form of the law is equal, the substance of the law is unequal. Like the segregation laws, the laws barring same-sex marriage run afoul of the equal protection clause, in my view.",

The rationale for banning first cousin marriage has been that they increase the risk of children born with birth defects. But that increased risk is apparently tiny. Laws banning first cousin marriages are based on presumptions about marriage and child bearing that are not necessarily true. There is a small movement of people who are trying to eliminate laws banning first cousin marriages. This may be a kind of prohibition that can be overturned in the courts.

Time to reduce the size of the federal gov't and cut those benefits to nothing. The states can sort out the legal matters easily enough without ever having a marriage. For example 2 people who are friends could have an agreement for when one dies or is ill. The churches can get make to making marriages. \n \n I have a lot of friends who don't like my position but frankly the government idea is just countering their goal...so again I say \"how is that working out?\". \n \n \nFor the government to abandon these 1,000+ rights and benefits that have been codified in legislation over the years would be harmful to the typical married couple.\nSome have to stay but can be reorganized to include whatever AND be done by the state.

It's true that interracial marriage was a moralistic issue to some people, but I think it's far, far more the case with gay marriage than it was with interracial marriage. One was more of a racial issue, the other more of a moralistic/religious issue.\n\n \n This is most certainly not true. Inter-racial marriage was considered by most Americans to be a deeply moral issue, dating back to the 17th century. It was considered an offense to God for people to violate the anti-miscegenation laws. People regularly denounced miscegenation as a sin in the 18th and 19th centuries, and they insisted that God demanded racial purity. People made similar arguments in support of colonizing African Americans in Africa or elsewhere; one common argument was that \"God intended America to be a white man's country.\" And people made similar arguments in support of segregation laws in the post-Reconstruction era. They argued that God opposed race mixing. Miscegenation was regarded as horrible and as having the tragic consequence of producing mulatto offspring, which many argued would pull down the white race and destroy it. The arguments against inter-racial marriage were nearly always presented in religious terms. \n \n The reason most people are not aware of this today is because the anti-miscegenation argument has largely disappeared along with the anti-miscegenation laws. You don't hear people much any longer claiming that God hates race mixing. But it used to be common. I am working on a book about this. I am writing a biography of an African American in the early 19th century whose skin was so light, he could pass for white. He chose not to. But he was in that ambiguous in-between space between white and black, and he himself denounced inter-racial marriage and race mixing as against God's will. He became a minister.",

   "At the present, I know of no better way to decide what equality and freedom mean than via democracy.\n\n I honestly have no idea how you think such concepts could EVER be realistically determined by pure \"democracy\".\n Again, Democracy is two wolves and a lamb deciding on what is for dinner.\n \n The lamb's \"right to life\" being ignored by a democratic vote is hardly a real means of determining rights or freedom.\n Society is not consistent enough for such protections.\n Look at internment camps for Japanese Americans in WW II. Would that have been okay by standards of \"freedom\" just cause a majority at the time approved?\n And in the years after, when the horrible abuse of rights was recognized, would that mean the \"freedom\" suddenly existed again?\n While the crystal clarity of the courts may not be as solid as desirable, it is clearly more rigid and bound by more constraints than the arbitrary whim of society.\n \n \n \nIt seems there are two types of people on these kinds of issues...ones that feel getting the issue solved is more important than the procedure and those that feel the procedure is more important than the issue solved. I am the latter.\n\n I don't see why you would try to distinguish it in this manner.\n I see an EXISTING procedure at work. We disagree on its validity.\n The courts evaluate a legitimate state interest and determine if the discrimination is constitutional.\n That IS a procedure.\n \n I personally thought Prop 8 should be rejected because it didn't use the proper constitutional change voting requirements. The change was obviously a modification to the FUNDAMENTAL nature of the California constitution, ergo it should have required more than a simple majority.\n \n With that said, I still hold to the procedure.\n If the California populace were to vote in Prop 8 with the appropriate majority, I would recognize the process has been honored. I would not agree with the outcome, but still recognize the validity of it.\n \n \n \nI feel that if you sacrifice procedure you have made an unjust action which people will try to right one way or the other. You have also opened the door for further sacrifice of laws and rules of this country in order to get your way. The downside is that things take longer to happen and have growing pains.\n\n I sincerely believe by your procedural approach, we would still have states with miscegenation laws. \n \n \n \nShould I give an example? I feel that the people getting their way in a state is a legitimate state interest.\n\n The very nature of such an assessment completely eliminates the significance of the test.\n I can't think of any law that would be eliminated under such a standard, because every law has been voted into office. Either by the legislature or by the people.\n \n Every law passes under your interpretation.\n Recognizing that, if one adheres to the philosophy of a \"legitimate state interest\", a simple will of the people cannot provide sufficient rational.\n The courts have even stated this explicitly.\n \n \n \nYou'd probably disagree with this.\n\n emoticon_xgood\n \n \n \nI feel anything not specific in the constitution is a legitimate state interest...you again probably disagree. So now we have no idea what that term even means.\n\n Uh. No.\n YOUR explanation gives no idea what the term means.\n There does exist an application of the term, which contradicts your personal application.\n \n \n \nAs far as I can tell it comes down to what 5 outta 9 people think it should mean. Hardly democratic.\n\n Actually, I would argue that \"hardly democratic\" is PART OF THE POINT.\n The test for legitimate state interest CANNOT be satisfied by a \"democratic\" approach, otherwise no law would be invalidated.\n \n And as for what \"it should mean\", there are a variety of legal rulings on the subject, including the different standards like strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, rational basis.\n \n On another level, I can't help but refer back to the 14th amendment.\n The people who WROTE the 14th amendment could have EXPLICITLY WROTE what they wanted, but they did not.\n They kept it vague.\n They didn't even mention race in the section in question.\n The clause was obviously written with race in mind, but they NEVER SAID IT.\n To put that a different way, it was a conscious decision TO EXCLUDE any mention of what the 14th amendment was specifically designed to address.\n \n The obvious conclusion is that they meant for the 14th amendment to encompass MORE than just race.\n They wanted it to BE an issue that needed to be interpreted.\n \n \n \nYou are right, the constitution only says \"Congress shall make no law\"...so technically they could do a lot of things with religion. States had state-sponsored religion well after the 14th amendment (well not \"well\" after...but years after).\n\n And what I described would be entirely legal at the state level...\n \n \n \nA 1,000 benefits? Ugh. If the federal government limited its size we wouldn't be worrying about that. They give 1,000 benefits and we have a divorce rate over 50%. Clearly any goal they have is not working.\n\n To be fair, that list is pretty well itemized. Inheritance. Taxes. Spousal consent. Spousal privilege. etc, etc.\n It also includes DIVORCE requirements as a \"right / benefit\".\n The legislation that prevents a man from saying (and implementing) \"get out of my house, we're divorced\" is part of those benefits.\n \n \n \nTime to reduce the size of the federal gov't and cut those benefits to nothing. The states can sort out the legal matters easily enough without ever having a marriage.\n\n It would essentially come down to a \"he said / she said\" situation, leaving no legislation guidelines on how to address the situation.\n I wouldn't think that wise.\n \n \n \nFor example 2 people who are friends could have an agreement for when one dies or is ill. The churches can get make to making marriages. \n\n For some aspects, such \"agreements\" would be possible.\n For other aspects, how can you force a hospital to give you visitation rights if the hospital says \"relatives only\" and you're just a friend?\n There are some rights in that list of 1,000+ which are not capable of being achieved by simple documents between two people.\n \n While some of those rights/benefits govern interaction between the two, others govern interaction between the couple and outside agencies, like insurance companies, employers, hospitals, the government, etc.\n If Joe and Mary sign an agreement that says she will be covered under his policy, does that mean the employer has to honor such an agreement?\n No. \n \n \n \nI have a lot of friends who don't like my position but frankly the government idea is just countering their goal...so again I say \"how is that working out?\". \n\n That's a bit like throwing out the baby with the bath-water...\n Drain the dirty water. Prepare good water. Then wash the baby with the new system.\n \n \n \nSome have to stay but can be reorganized to include whatever AND be done by the state. The goal of creating a \"family unit\" has failed for the government and they, like everything, have made it worse.\n\n I don't think the goal has anything to do with \"family unit\" (unless we are defining \"family\" as just a couple), so I think we agree there.\n Of those 1,000+ benefits / rights, absolutely none of them are enhanced by the presence of offspring.\n Absolutely none of them are detracted from by the absence of offspring.\n \n \n \nI mean really...now we have a court being protested against for making a ruling they probably were bound to make in accordance with the law (from what I read of the opinion).\n\n People will protest for anything.\n There was going to be a protest regardless of which side won.\n I wouldn't put much weight in the capability to hold a protest...",

The California Supreme Court had to interpret the state constitution's distinction between amending the constitution and revising the constitution. Did banning same-sex marriage amount to revising the state constitution, or was it just amending the state constitution? They ruled it was the latter. It probably was the right ruling, from what I have read about the case. While the result of the ruling is disappointing, the ruling itself was probably a correct interpretation of the California constitution.

Inter-racial sexual relationships and marriage were both criminalized around the nation. People who violated these laws went to prison or worse. We don't know exactly how many people were lynched for allegedly engaging in inter-racial sexual relationships. \n \n I think you are minimizing and misjudging the depth of racism and the depth of opposition to inter-racial marriage and inter-racial sex that existed in America for much of our history. In 1967, the year of the Loving v. Virginia ruling, marrying someone of a different race was a criminal act in Virginia and could bring a prison sentence. The popular opposition to inter-racial marriage in 1967, according to Gallup polls, was higher than the opposition to same-sex marriage is today, according to Gallup polls. \n \n And of course, people insisted that they did not oppose inter-racial marriage out of bigotry or prejudice. They insisted that they opposed inter-racial marriage out of their moral beliefs. Few people think they are prejudiced. Usually they insist that their prejudices against a particular group of people are legitimate beliefs, and often people claim that these beliefs are supported by the Bible.\n \n For most of American history, while most people deeply opposed inter-racial marriage, they didn't think of same-sex marriage. That's probably why most state laws did not explicitly ban same-sex marriage, because people didn't even think of it. They didn't think of it because gay people were largely invisible, and gay people were therefore not regarded as a threat. They weren't even on the public radar screen. African Americans were visible, and they were widely regarded as a threat. And inter-racial marriage was most certainly presented and widely regarded as a moral issue.",

Loving v. Virginia was a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the Virginia law banning inter-racial marriage was unconstitutional. It was not a ruling about same-sex marriage. In this ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court majority stated that marriage is a fundamental right. They cited previous rulings on this point. \n \n The U.S. Supreme Court has never made a ruling about same-sex marriage that I know of, at least not yet. \n \n The California Supreme Court did not rule based on the U.S. constitution. They ruled based on the California state constitution. Their first ruling said that the California constitution guaranteed an equal right to marry to same-sex couples. The voters then amended the state constitution so this is no longer true. The issue that came back to the California Supreme Court was not whether the California constitution is in conflict with the U.S. constitution. The issue was whether the California constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage would stand because of the way in which it was passed. The court ruled that it would stand. This had nothing to do with whether the amendment violates the U.S. constitution, which was not before the California Supreme Court. \n \n Could a California couple bring a lawsuit in federal court to try to overturn the California constitutional provision that bans same-sex marriage, by arguing that this constitutional provision violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the U.S. constitution? Yes, they probably could. It might not be a good idea, however, as the current U.S. Supreme Court cannot be counted on to strike down the California constitutional provision banning same-sex marriage. A better approach right now is probably to go back to the voters in California and eliminate the provision in the state constitution that bans same-sex marriage. I think it's likely that marriage equality will win at the ballot box this time. \n \n Marriage laws have traditionally been up to the states. But state power in this regard is not unlimited, which is what the Supreme Court said in the Loving v. Virginia ruling. They ruled that states cannot pass marriage laws that deny people the equal protection of the laws. That's why there is the possibility of someone bringing a federal lawsuit based on the 14th amendment.",

   "The Loving case will almost certainly be relevant to a same-sex marriage case that may in the future be brought in federal court to challenge a state law as a violation of the U.S. constitution. I am sure the attorneys for the plaintiffs will cite the Loving v. Virginia ruling in such a case. But that's for a future case in which someone challenges a state law as violating the U.S. constitution. In California, the issue before the state supreme court was whether the California state constitution required equal marriage rights.\n\n \n Yes, the case will likely be cited from both sides of the issue,... those in favor of \"Gay marriage\" will cite it because it (through judicial activism) broadend the definition of \"marriage.\" Those opposed to further broadening the definition will cite it because while Loving v. Virginia expanded the definition to include inter-racial couples,... it left in tact (even though there were gays in society at the time) the \"general welfare\" (article 1, section 8) premise of a \"one man one woman\" (natural law) relationship as being the most basic building block; from which extends to create our society and government.\n \n In short, look for a true \"contsructionist\" line of reasoning on the case.",

   "Two wrongs don't make a right,.... if the Court erred in declaring \"gay Marriage\" is a Constitutional right,.... that's bad enough. \n\n emoticon_wow\n You don't even know what the California constitution says, yet you automatically declare they were wrong in interpreting it?\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nAt least they didn't compound their error by overturning prop 8 on the grounds that a State Constitution can not trump the United States Constitution.\n\n What???\n Do you know anything about either of these rulings?\n Can you please figure out what they DID talk about before you go on these bizarre rants?\n \n \n \nWhich helps make my point. Let me explain.\n 1: You claim that the first ruling held that \"gay marriage\" is a Constitutional (Loving v. Virginia) \"right.\" Correct?\n 2: You then claim that to forbid \"gay marriage\" the people of the State (California) had to amend the STATE Constitution for the STATE of California,... Correct?\n 3: This Amendment is challenged and went to the same State Supreme Court that held that \"Gay marriage\" is a Constitutional right and that court; instead of helding fast to their first claim and overturning the Amendment because it runs contrary to the United States Constitution; They rule in favor of the State's right to define marriage as one man and one woman.-- Correct?\n\n Oy vey. To try to make sure you don't have gaps in what you are saying.\n 1A) Loving v Virginia established marriage as a right. Period.\n That is not questionable.\n 1B) The first CALIFORNIA ruling held that gay marriage is a CALIFORNIA state constitutional right.\n \n 2) Yes.\n \n 3) Since your earlier error is corrected, hopefully you can now understand how modifying the STATE constitution voided the earlier interpretation of the STATE constitution.\n \n The thing you don't seem to recognize is that state and federal constitutions have some overlap in concepts. But at the same time, the state and federal constitutions have VARYING LEVELS OF REQUIREMENTS for equality.\n \n \n \n5: Note that there is no appeal to the United States Supreme Court on this ruling. Instead, the protestors are vowing to draft yet another ballot issue to once again amend the California Constitution to gain the right for gays to marry again.-- Correct?\n\n Yes.\n \n Hopefully now that your error is pointed out, you can see the flaw in your thinking.",

You are trying to argue that under the U.S. constitution, the states have broad powers to act for the general welfare. The problem with your constitutional references is that Article 1, Section 8 deals with the powers of Congress, not the states. \n \n People have long debated the extent of the powers granted to the federal government under the constitution. Some have argued that the constitution limits the powers of the Congress to those specifically named in Article I, Section 8, and that's it. No more federal power. Other powers, they argue, are reserved to the states and to the people. This was Thomas Jefferson's position. Others have argued that Article 1, Section 8 itself gives Congress broad powers, specifically through this, the \"necessary and proper\" clause: \n \n \"To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\"\n \n The folks who argue that the constitution gives the federal government broad powers have pointed to this and to certain other clauses, notably the commerce clause, as the constitutional basis for their arguments. Chief Justice John Marshall, whom Jefferson hated, viewed the constitution as granting broad power to the federal government. \n \n When it comes to state powers, the relevant sections of the constitution are Amendment 10, which reserves to the states or to the people those powers not delegated to the Congress, and Amendment 14, which was passed to limit the powers of states to pass laws that deny rights to persons. The 14th amendment is written in broad language, and there has been much debate over what it means. What does \"equal protection of the laws\" mean, and what are the limits of equal protection? Where does a state's power to regulate end and an individual's rights begin? And since the 14th amendment does not specify what rights it protects, there is the big and ever-present question of what individual rights the amendment protects. The question you asked me has to do with whether \"marriage\" is a fundamental right protected by the U.S. constitution from state abrogation. The Supreme Court in previous rulings, including but not limited to the Loving decision, has declared that marriage is a fundamental right. If that is so, to what extent can states limit the right to marry? And does the right to marry include the right of same-sex couples to marry legally? The Supreme Court of the United States has not ruled on this last question. \n \n These are hotly debated questions. I suspect Steeeve would argue that the 14th amendment does not protect a right to marry, which is nowhere named in the constitution, and that this is one reason why Loving v. Virginia was wrongly decided. He would probably argue that the Supreme Court made up a right to marry. But I will let him explain his position on that instead of speculating about it. \n \n The question of whether there is a fundamental right to marry protected by the U.S. constitution is different from the question in the California marriage case, which addressed whether the state constitution of California protected a right to marry that extended to same-sex couples. The Supreme Court of California ruled that state constitution did protect that right, and then it was amended by the voters, and now it no longer protects the right of same-sex couples to marry. This is why the Court ruled that those who married same-sex spouses during the time when same-sex marriage was a right protected by the California constitution are still married today. Their marriages are not dissolved by the amendment to the state constitution.",

   "It may have been deeply moral, and I'm not saying it wasn't. My point was in terms of degree--I still maintain that gay relationships is a far more moralistic issue than even interracial marriage ever was. While interracial marriage was a 'taboo' at one time, the idea of gay marriage was downright incomprehensible at one time. At the same time interracial marriage was considered morally reprehensible, a homosexual relationship would be considered on the order of the most horrendous matter, far more so than an interracial marriage, which was at least still between a male and a female.\n\n \n Yeah, and a hundred years before that (Civil war and before), interracial marriage was considered on the order of the most horrendous manner.\n \n All you are doing is pointing out that interracial got going before gay did, and got accepted earlier becuase they got going earlier.

What we now call racism, or bigotry, was a set of common beliefs among nearly all white Americans earlier in our history. Our thinking about race has changed. But what we would now label racism or bigotry was the norm for most of American history. Were the people who held these views \"monsters?\" No. But they held these views. This is my area of research; I teach and research African American history and the history of race and racism, and I can point you to wonderful sources on this topic, if you are interested in reading further. \n \n The fact that \"good, everyday folks\" believe something does not make their beliefs benign or unprejudiced. The fact that they point to the Bible for justification for their beliefs does not make their beliefs benign or unprejudiced. Their pleasant attitude and religious devotion does not cleanse prejudiced beliefs of prejudice. \n \n I don't think people usually oppose equality for gay people only because of their religious beliefs. I think people oppose equality for gay people mainly because they have been taught anti-gay attitudes since they were children, and people have used the Bible to try to justify those beliefs. You yourself suggested this in an earlier post, when you said you suspect that even if religion didn't exist, people would still hold anti-gay attitudes. \n \n Anti-gay prejudice IS prejudice. To deny this is to deny what is in front of our noses. You have heard the expressions of anti-gay prejudice in these forums, and you yourself have chastised other posters for their expressions anti-gay prejudice. We don't imagine the prejudice, or believe we experience it because we somehow \"automatically\" equate anti-gay attitudes with anti-black prejudice. Most gay people have directly experienced anti-gay prejudice, and many of us have suffered physical violence against us because of anti-gay prejudice. This is not a theoretical question; it's real when you are beaten up for being gay. I was beaten up in an anti-gay attack years ago. I have experienced it myself. It's real prejudice, believe me. \n \n You seem to want to draw a distinction between what you think are okay anti-gay attitudes that are based on the Bible and bad anti-gay attitudes, which you attribute to bad people who would attack gay people. I think there certainly are gradations of anti-gay prejudice. But it's all prejudice, in my view. It's judging gay people by a characteristic we have rather than judging us as individuals. People who harbor anti-gay prejudice also frequently focus on what they imagine to be the sex we engage in. They do not view heterosexuals in this way. People who harbor anti-gay prejudice often fail to see us as whole human beings for whom sex is just one part of life, one part of our spousal relationships. Instead of seeing our marriages as full marriages, they focus exclusively on what they imagine to be the sex we have. That's clear from some of the posts in these forums. \n \n I think we should not excuse people's anti-gay attitudes just because they are nice people. Nice people can hold wrong beliefs about others, beliefs that are harmful to others. They have the right to hold wrong beliefs, but we should not pretend that their anti-gay prejudice isn't prejudice. \n \n Yes, there are gradations of prejudice of all kinds. There are people who kill or beat up gay people. There are people who try to pass laws that discriminate against gay people and deny gay people basic civil rights. There are people who kick their own gay children out of their homes. There are people who believe that \"homosexuality is immoral,\" who treat gay people as equals and who do not try to promote discrimination against gay people. These last folks harbor anti-gay prejudice, but they do nothing to deny anyone else fair and equal treatment, and they are generous and accepting of others. I suspect that many of them end up letting go of their anti-gay prejudice as they interact with gay people. They come to abandon their anti-gay beliefs. The people in this last group, who support equality for gay people regardless of what they think of same-sex relationships, are fine, I think. And more Americans are moving into this category over time.",

   "The fact that \"good, everyday folks\" believe something does not make their beliefs benign or unprejudiced. The fact that they point to the Bible for justification for their beliefs does not make their beliefs benign or unprejudiced. \n\n \n What I'm doing here is questioning your approach of assuming their beliefs aren't benign to begin with. See, it's the other end of the spectrum here that I take issue with, not what you said here. It's this assumption of bigotry by default if this issue is even disagreed on that I think is a bad approach. Of course being good people doesn't make their beliefs benign, but I have a real problem with the inherent premise that they are already guilty of bigotry to begin with. THAT'S what I'm talking about. This presumption-of-guilt approach. Assertions of bigotry are a very serious and nasty thing to levy against someone. We probably wouldn't START with the assumption that disagreement on polygamy is based on bigotry, but the sort of approach you employ here would indeed do so if you're being consistent. I see no reason that people shouldn't be given the benefit of the doubt just because we happen to be talking about a homosexuality-related issue. I think this is a very important point, and I also think it's something that often turns people off to your movement a great deal. You're doing it (unaware, probably) by even trying to interchange interracial marriage into the equation, something that did turn out to be a bigotry-based issue at one time. Whether opposition to gay relationships does so remains to be seen, but we don't need to presume guilt in people automatically, in cases where it's not clear. Some cases are clear, but many of them are not. If we're going to start with the premise of bigotry to begin with--a guilty-till-proven-innocent approach on this, then we need to assume ANY sort of religious/moral disapproval of ANY kind of marriage is rooted in bigotry. Polygamy, underage, you name it.\n \n \nTheir pleasant attitude and religious devotion does not cleanse prejudiced beliefs of prejudice. \n\n \n Again, why are you condemning them as prejudiced to begin with? It's an unfair approach you're taking. You seem to take the position that disagreement can't exist without bigotry. I think that's extremely overly presumptuous.\n \n \nI don't think people usually oppose equality for gay people only because of their religious beliefs.\n\n \n Oh I disagree; I think many do it only for the reason of religious belief. You aren't around these folks as much as I am as you are a part of a UU church. And I think the gay pride movement's strategy of wanting to try and find bigotry under every single rock is something that has turned people off and comes across as a bit of a prejudice-complex.\n \n \nYou yourself suggested this in an earlier post, when you said you suspect that even if religion didn't exist, people would still hold anti-gay attitudes.\n\n \n Well, that's because I tend to use the terms 'religion' and 'morality' interchangeably which I probably shouldn't for the sake of clarity. My point in that case wasn't that bigotry is always there, but rather that the 'ick-factor' is often there, and I think to some degree aversion to relationships outside one's orientation is a natural thing. At some level it is behind what you call \"homophobia\". The 'ick-factor' also seems to exist among gays if they think of straight relationships from what I've seen people post at times. When I said people would still hold anti-gay attitudes (if that's how I phrased it) I didn't mean they would be BIGOTS even if religion didn't exist.\n \n \nAnti-gay prejudice IS prejudice. To deny this is to deny what is in front of our noses. You have heard the expressions of anti-gay prejudice in these forums, and you yourself have chastised other posters for their expressions anti-gay prejudice. \n\n \n But that's like using one black sheep to exemplify a whole flock of typical sheep. Posters who say mean and horrible things about gays DO show they are harboring bigotry when they do that. I'm taking issue with the idea that mere disagreement is bigotry, and I think that presumption is a MAJOR problem in this debate, in society. I think it has held it back.\n \n \nYou seem to want to draw a distinction between what you think are okay anti-gay attitudes that are based on the Bible and bad anti-gay attitudes, which you attribute to bad people who would attack gay people. I think there certainly are gradations of anti-gay prejudice. But it's all prejudice, in my view.\n \n \n Yes, I do indeed think we SHOULD draw a distinction between the sort of people who physically beat people from those that who only simply disagree in the marketplace of discourse, and not presume bigotry on the part of people who just disagree. I think it's somewhat disingenuous to NOT do so. We shouldn't even put those two in the same category of any kind. To just take disagreement and chalk it up as \"bigotry\" and \"prejudice\" goes against some very important principles of tolerance and discourse that is important in a pluralistic society. To just throw gay-beaters and people who disagree in discourse all into the same pot of 'prejudice' is an irrational approach, IMO. I think it is very presumptuous to even think of gay-beaters and 'disagreers' in discourse about gay marriage as even being in the same realm or along some spectrum. They are often not allies, and that's why it's not uncommon at all for religious people who disagree with your view on this to condemn things like anti-gay violence. It's because they AREN'T of the same cloth, rather than they are. The former is an example of extremism and violence. The latter is what happens in a pluralistic society. We'd all be in some weird Orwellian boring world if people didn't disagree on some things.\n \n \nIt's judging gay people by a characteristic we have rather than judging us as individuals.\n\n \n I think this is where some people misunderstand a lot of religious people. There really is a difference between the view that an ACTION is not ok, and the judging of people. If someone says 'polygamy is not ok', they are not judging polygamists. They simply making a statement about an action. And regarding the 'characteristic' point you made, to many religious people, the fact that some people are ORIENTED toward a given action can't trump morality regarding that action. It's like asking them to throw aside their belief about any number of other issues of what they would call \"sin\" just because some people are oriented toward engaging in that action.",

   "What I'm doing here is questioning your approach of assuming their beliefs aren't benign to begin with. See, it's the other end of the spectrum here that I take issue with, not what you said here. It's this assumption of bigotry by default if this issue is even disagreed on that I think is a bad approach. Of course being good people doesn't make their beliefs benign, but I have a real problem with the inherent premise that they are already guilty of bigotry to begin with. THAT'S what I'm talking about. This presumption-of-guilt approach. Assertions of bigotry are a very serious and nasty thing to levy against someone. We probably wouldn't START with the assumption that disagreement on polygamy is based on bigotry, but the sort of approach you employ here would indeed do so if you're being consistent. I see no reason that people shouldn't be given the benefit of the doubt just because we happen to be talking about a homosexuality-related issue. I think this is a very important point, and I also think it's something that often turns people off to your movement a great deal. You're doing it (unaware, probably) by even trying to interchange interracial marriage into the equation, something that did turn out to be a bigotry-based issue at one time. Whether opposition to gay relationships does so remains to be seen, but we don't need to presume guilt in people automatically, in cases where it's not clear. Some cases are clear, but many of them are not. If we're going to start with the premise of bigotry to begin with--a guilty-till-proven-innocent approach on this, then we need to assume ANY sort of religious/moral disapproval of ANY kind of marriage is rooted in bigotry. Polygamy, underage, you name it.\n\n \n It seems to me that you don't want to believe that anti-gay prejudice really is prejudice because you don't like the idea that it is. You believe that anti-black prejudice really is prejudice because you reject that form of prejudice, and the people around you and in your church also reject it. You seem to not want to believe that anti-gay prejudice really is prejudice, because many of the people you know and whom you like and who share your religious faith harbor anti-gay beliefs. Therefore, you presume these beliefs are benign and are not examples of prejudice because you don't want to view people you like and respect as prejudiced. \n \n Note that I am not using the term \"bigotry\" here, because it is so loaded. I am using the noun \"prejudice,\" because prejudice suggests beliefs about people that can be changed and that are not necessarily hateful. Prejudice refers to making pre-judgments of people based on a characteristic and not simply judging them as individuals. Prejudice does not necessarily suggest hatred of people. There of course are anti-gay people whose prejudice leads them to bigotry in the worst hateful sense, but we are not talking about them. \n \n Let's go back to the hypothetical example I mentioned in an earlier post and to which you did not respond. Imagine someone says, \"I think Judaism is a sin. People who practice Judaism are engaging in a sinful lifestyle. Judaism is against my moral beliefs. I think Jews should not be allowed by law to marry Christians, because this is against God's will. I think Jews should not be allowed to serve openly in the military, because good Christians should not be forced to serve alongside open Jews. The Bible is the source of my religious beliefs. The Jews killed Jesus.\" \n \n Would you regard these statements as benign expressions of someone's moral beliefs? Or would you regard these statements as expressions of prejudice? I suspect you would regard these statements as expressions of prejudice. These are pretty much exactly the kinds of things that people say about gay people on a regular basis. Yet when people say these kinds of things about gay people, you argue that these are merely expressions of people's beliefs, not expressions of anti-gay prejudice. I think the fact that many of the people you know and like still harbor anti-gay prejudice is a reason why you refuse to see such statements as prejudice. Few Americans today would say these kinds of things about Jews, though some would. Many Americans still say these kinds of things about gay people. The people who say these things about Jews probably don't regard themselves as prejudiced; they probably regard themselves as simply expressing their beliefs, what they see as true. Likewise, the people who supported racial segregation laws did not view themselves as prejudiced. They viewed themselves as expressing their moral beliefs and saying what they thought was true. Just like you say this about people who harbor anti-gay prejudice. \n \n Now let's imagine the person above says something different. Let's imagine the person says this: \"I think Judaism is a sin. People who practice Judaism are engaging in a sinful lifestyle, because they don't accept Jesus as their Lord and Saviour. Judaism is against my moral beliefs. However, I know we live in a society where people are free to practice their religion, no matter what their religion is. I do not believe Jews should be denied any rights. I am always respectful toward Jewish people, and I treat them the same way I treat Christians.\" \n \n That, in my view, is very different from the first statements I presented. The person in this second imaginary scenario does not seek to deny any rights to Jewish people, and the person does not treat Jewish people any differently from fellow Christians. The person may harbor anti-Jewish prejudice, which the person views as his or her religious beliefs. But these beliefs do not undermine the rights of Jews, nor do they result in negative treatment toward Jews. \n \n I think that's okay, whether these are attitudes toward gays or Jews. The person may dislike what they regard as a \"sinful lifestyle,\" but they don't do anything to deny equal rights or fair and neighborly treatment to the people in question, whether they are gays or Jews.",

   "Oh I disagree; I think many do it only for the reason of religious belief. You aren't around these folks as much as I am as you are a part of a UU church.

You seem to be arguing, \"Oh, this isn't prejudice. You are just imagining it. You have a 'prejudice-complex.'\" \n \n You are wrong about this. You have not experienced the prejudice that gay people experience on a regular basis, and you obviously don't know. And yes, we do experience this prejudice from good Christians. It's not benign. It may not be hatred in many cases, but it's not benign, and it's not loving. If you haven't experienced it, or if you haven't really listened and tried to learn about it, you don't know. Your statements show that. I realize you are a person of good will, but you don't really understand what gay people go through, and you don't really understand how even good Christians often treat gay people. The prejudice is real; we are not imagining it. \n \n I am around Christians all the time. I was raised Christian, and I have studied the history of Christian theology in North America. I was active for years in a group called Clergy and Laity Concerned, which was an inter-faith group made up mostly of Christians. I sometimes go to Christian churches. I have worked with Christians to oppose the war in Iraq and to oppose the death penalty. I have been with and have worked with Christians who hold all different beliefs about gay people and about \"homosexuality.\" This is familiar terrain. I certainly do not regard Christians as \"monsters,\" whatever their beliefs about gay people. \n \n However, I have experienced anti-gay prejudice from Christians. I have also experienced Christians challenging fellow Christians on their anti-gay prejudice. I have experienced Christians viewing gay people through the lens of horrible stereotypes, without realizing what they did not know about gay people. The response to them, I think, should be to try to educate them about our lives. The more people get to know gay people, the less then tend to harbor prejudice against gay people. This is true regardless of people's religious beliefs about homosexuality.",

And that's where I think you're being unreasonble in your approach.\n\n \n It really depends on what you are \"disagreeing\" with. If you \"disagree\" with same-sex sex, then fine. Don't have sex with someone of the same sex. That's not, in my mind, prejudice. That's just an opinion about sex. \n \n Prejudice is an attitude about people. It may or may not lead to negative or harmful behavior toward those people. I don't care much about prejudice that does not lead to harmful behavior. I do care when prejudice leads to efforts to deny people fundamental rights or when prejudice leads to efforts to discriminate against or ostracize people. \n \n People may rationalize their prejudice by saying it's because they \"disagree\" with a person's imagined or real behavior. And sometimes it is hard to disentangle prejudice against persons from beliefs about their perceived behavior. \n \n I will give you an example of a prejudice that I think I harbor that I am trying not to harbor. I oppose smoking. I think it's terrible for people's health, and I am very glad that our state passed a law banning smoking in public places. I fear, though, that I harbor prejudice against smokers. I don't want to, but I fear that deep down inside me I look down on smokers as immoral, as lesser people because of their nasty habit. I consciously am appalled by my own feeling, and I am trying to rid myself of it. My opinion of smoking is simply a belief. My deep down feeling about smokers is prejudice. Now, when it comes to laws and rights, this gets complicated. I do believe in passing laws to restrict smoking in public places. This is because second-hand smoke affects my health and the health of my daughter, who has asthma. Public indoor smoking harms our ability to breathe. So there is a rational basis for passing laws to ban smoking in public places. In contrast, legalizing same-sex marriage does nothing to harm opposite-sex marriage or to harm anyone's right to marry a person of the opposite sex. There is no rational basis for denying same-sex couples the right to marry. Same-sex marriage protects families and especially children; it does not harm anyone, and it does not undermine anyone's marriage. \n \n As for \"changing the definition of marriage,\" this is just a semantic argument put forward by anti-equality activists. Marriage in Massachusetts is the same as it was before same-sex marriage was legalized there. Opposite-sex couples do not encounter a redefined institution when they go to marry. What has changed is that people who were previously barred from marrying the consenting adult of their choice are now included in the institution in Massachusetts and in a few other states.",

   "I honestly have no idea how you think such concepts could EVER be realistically determined by pure \"democracy\".\n Again, Democracy is two wolves and a lamb deciding on what is for dinner.\n \n The lamb's \"right to life\" being ignored by a democratic vote is hardly a real means of determining rights or freedom.\n Society is not consistent enough for such protections.\nI don't doubt that democracy procedures an imperfect result but how else do you determine what rights are without resorting to a dicatorship or some kind? Now if God came down here and said \"I am ruling and here is what the rights are\" than so be it (and I believe rights come from Him anyway) but people have different views and it is hard to say why my view is better than yours or yours better than mine. \n \n \nWhile the crystal clarity of the courts may not be as solid as desirable, it is clearly more rigid and bound by more constraints than the arbitrary whim of society.\nI think the courts are more rigid but their constraints are only that they have to agree with 4 other people. This is basically a rule by very few. If we have 5 people up there that say gay marriage is not a right than changing that will be about as hard as changing abortion laws. Very rigid and very undemocratic and very against the constitution.\n \n \nThe courts evaluate a legitimate state interest and determine if the discrimination is constitutional.\n That IS a procedure.\nIt is not a procedure because it is unworkable and never was a procedure. It comes across as a result first and a procedure second...ie you work from \"here is the result we feel is best and lets make a way to get there\". This is what a policy maker is supposed to do.\n \n \nI sincerely believe by your procedural approach, we would still have states with miscegenation laws. \nPerhaps I need to define it better but I don't have time right now....Our current nominee for supreme court shows this best. She believes the result is most important. So in this case it is achieving gay rights. This is justified, basically, by saying the courts have the power to do whatever. It is a result oriented approach to the law. This is evident in many of the protesters who wanted their way no matter what. They even stated they would protest against the decision if it went against their way....not even bothering to read the thing to see if it made logical sense.\n \n Again, this approach is popular because it assumes that judges will push for \"justice\" (as a loose term) and it is faster at achieving results because you only have to convince 5 people instead of millions. The other approach pretty much assumes the courts are the weakest branch and will make decisions not on what is popular or what may be \"just\" but what the law actually says to do. \n \n Consider the following example: A contact says \"you will pay reasonable rent for 100 years\" and at the time it was known (but not written in the contract) that reasonable meant fair market value. Fifty years later this contract is still intact and fair market value for rent is, for some reason, grossly more than surrounding places and causes this person suffering because they are contractual bound to pay the rent. \n \n The two approaches would probably result in this:\n Procedure approach: 'reasonable' has and always meant fair market value so that is what it is...you are bound by that.\n Result based approach: 'the contract said reasonable rent because it wanted to be fair and clearly it isn't fair because the person is suffering and others around him don't have to pay as much...the rent is reduced'.\n \n the result based approach really just created a new contract based on nothing more than the judges opinion. This is dangerous and makes a court that IS supposed to be the weakest branch the most powerful.\n \n \n \nActually, I would argue that \"hardly democratic\" is PART OF THE POINT. The test for legitimate state interest CANNOT be satisfied by a \"democratic\" approach, otherwise no law would be invalidated.\nSure it would because we democratically said that the constitution is the supreme law and you can't violate it without amendments. \n \n \nAnd as for what \"it should mean\", there are a variety of legal rulings on the subject, including the different standards like strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, rational basis.\nAll created by the courts over various time based on nothing more than their opinion. Intermediate scrutiny was basically the brain child of Oconner. Out of no where.\n \n \nOn another level, I can't help but refer back to the 14th amendment.\n The people who WROTE the 14th amendment could have EXPLICITLY WROTE what they wanted, but they did not.\n They kept it vague.\n They didn't even mention race in the section in question.\nIt applies to more than race but clearly race was a motivator like you say. Something being vague also doesn't mean judges decide what it can or can't mean. Refer back to my example. \"Reasonable\" is a vague term but it meant something to those who adopted it. If you are to say reasonable means what a judge thinks it should mean at any given time than you render the term meaningless so why even bother with it? And if you don't know what a vague term means how you can rule on it? I'd say they left it broad but meaningful. \"Due process of law\" clearly means what it meant in the 4th amendment...why would it have a substantive aspect now(for example)?\n \n \nThe obvious conclusion is that they meant for the 14th amendment to encompass MORE than just race.\n They wanted it to BE an issue that needed to be interpreted.\nYes to the first part and no to the second part. That doesn't logically follow. You can't get from \"we have broad terms\" to \"therefore the courts should decide the meaning\". This is almost an admission that the writers had no idea what it means. It can be broad and still have meaning as well. Look at the word \"speech\"...this is actually a broad term and had meaning at the time of adoption. My point is you should always default to what the writers and adopters meant and not what a current judge feels it should mean. This follows to the 14th amendment.\n \n \nAnd what I described would be entirely legal at the state level...\nWhether it should or shouldn't is not the question. The question is who should decide. I feel the people should and not the judges because they are a slave to the people.\n \n \nFor other aspects, how can you force a hospital to give you visitation rights if the hospital says \"relatives only\" and you're just a friend?\nLeave it up to the hospital.",

   "I've read through the entire thread and the only fact you have posted was an article about protesters who blocked an intersection. You do know this country has a rich tradition of civil disobedience, right?\n\n \n You're right, I thought I posted some specific evidence on this thread but it was on another. So let me correct that right now, with an excerpt: Stanley Kurtz on Gay Marriage on National Review Online\n \n There's a new development in the story of Europe's marriage meltdown. Recently, a group of five scholars in the Netherlands issued a letter addressed to \"parliaments of the world debating the issue of same-sex marriage.\" The Netherlands was the first country to adopt full-fledged same-sex marriage, and this letter is the first serious indication of Dutch concern about the consequences of that decision. So it's worth quoting the letter at some length. After citing a raft of statistics documenting the decline of Dutch marriage, here is some of what these scholars had to say: ...there is as yet no definitive scientific evidence to suggest the long campaign for the legalization of same-sex marriage contributed to these harmful trends. However, there are good reasons to believe the decline in Dutch marriage may be connected to the successful public campaign for the opening of marriage to same-sex couples in the Netherlands. After all, supporters of same-sex marriage argued forcefully in favor of the (legal and social) separation of marriage from parenting. In parliament, advocates and opponents alike agreed that same-sex marriage would pave the way to greater acceptance of alternative forms of cohabitation.\n In our judgment, it is difficult to imagine that a lengthy, highly visible, and ultimately successful campaign to persuade Dutch citizens that marriage is not connected to parenthood and that marriage and cohabitation are equally valid 'lifestyle choices' has not had serious social consequences....\n \n There are undoubtedly other factors that have contributed to the decline of the institution of marriage in our country. Further scientific research is needed to establish the relative importance of all these factors. At the same time, we wish to note that enough evidence of marital decline already exists to raise serious concerns about the wisdom of the efforts to deconstruct marriage in its traditional form.\n  You can read an interview with two of the letter's signers here, and a front-page news story about the letter in the Dutch paper, Reformatorisch Dagblad, here.\n \n UNDENIABLE DECLINE\n During last week's Federal Marriage Amendment debate, many senators referred to the Dutch scholars' statement, and to marital decline in Scandinavia and the Netherlands. Of course, you probably haven't heard about that, because, for the most part, the American press has refused to report the story.\n Even so, gay-marriage advocates are worried. M. V. Lee Badgett, research director for the Institute for Gay and Lesbian Strategic Studies, has issued a new critique of my work on Scandinavia and the Netherlands. In \"Unhealthy Half-Truths,\" I refuted Badgett's first attack. Now she's back. Badgett's critique of my work is long on statistical tricks and short on engagement with my actual argument.\n \n The bottom line is the neither Badgett nor anyone else has been able to get around the fact that marriage in both Scandinavia and the Netherlands is in deep decline. In Scandinavia, that decline began before same-sex registered partnerships were established, but has continued apace ever since. In the Netherlands, marital decline accelerated dramatically, in tandem with the growing campaign for gay marriage.\n \n The strategies for evading these hard truths don't work. Gay-marriage advocates regularly cite steady or improving rates of marriage and divorce in Scandinavian countries to prove that all is well. I've shown repeatedly that these numbers are misleading. Scandinavian marriage numbers are inflated by remarriages among the large number of divorced, for example. Scandinavian divorce numbers omit legally unrecorded breakups among the ever-increasing number of cohabiting parents. Total family dissolution rates in Scandinavia are actually up. I've made these points before, but Badgett and others just keep citing the misleading numbers.\n \n European demographers know perfectly well that marriage in Scandinavia is in deep trouble. British demographer David Coleman and senior Dutch demographer Joop Garssen have written that \"marriage is becoming a minority status\" in Scandinavia. In Denmark, a slight majority of all children are still born within marriage. Yet citing the 60 percent out-of-wedlock birthrate for firstborn children, Danish demographers Wehner, Kambskard, and Abrahamson argue that marriage has ceased to be the normative setting for Danish family life.\n \n This is the evidence which Ohio Prof wants to dismiss as a lot of nonsense. Which I'm sure you too will support since this evidence opposes what you want to accept as right and normal. Why should you allow facts and reality to get in the way, right? \n \n Here is more which you will want to make excuses and denials for. But remember, this isn't some anti gay conservative making these statements. They are being made by Northern Europeans who supported gay marriage originally. iMAPP.org | Institute for Marriage and Public Policy\n \n \nMaybe you could compare this devient \"militant\" agenda to those who fire bomb abortion clinics? Yes, yes, they are just doing the lords work and I'm sure it's all just swell and right in the world because we have a jaywalking homo issue at hand.\n\n \n Those who firebomb abortion clinics are not militants, they are terrorists and murderers who deserve to be punished as such. You see bm, I don't support certain types of violence just because I support the cause they oppose, such as abortion.",

The horrible scenario painted by the anti-suffrage alarmists did not come true. Women got the vote, and life went on as before. The same thing is happening in states and nations where gay people now have the right to marry. Life goes on as before. The family is not destroyed, heterosexual marriage remains as it was before, and civilization has not crumbled. And as people see that the dire predictions of anti-gay alarmists do not come true, they come to support same-sex marriage. \n \n The issue of gay marriage is not about gay people marrying? For gay people it is. Gay people want to get married, for the same reasons that heterosexuals want to get married. Marriage is marriage. Same-sex marriage and opposite-sex marriage are the same.

Amsterdam in particular is wild and liberal. Most foreigners know about the legalized prostitution there. The idea that a debate over same-sex marriage led people to question and abandon opposite-sex marriage is far-fetched. People in Amsterdam have questioned traditional ways of life for a long time. Some folks may be dismayed over that, but the questioning and challenging of traditional values there long predates the debate over same-sex marriage. There is no evidence that the debate over same-sex marriage caused this attitudinal change in the Netherlands, which happened before same-sex marriage became an issue.

They admit that they cannot say on the basis of evidence that same-sex marriage has contributed to the \"decline\" of marriage in the Netherlands, and they call for more research. \n \n Let's consider for a moment their speculation that the debate over same-sex marriage somehow caused a decline in opposite-sex marriage in the Netherlands.\n \n Opposite-sex couples do not choose whether or not to marry based on a debate in the society over same-sex marriage. They decide to marry or not based on their own personal life circumstances, their own wishes. \n \n Try to imagine this scenario: \n \n Jane: \"I have been reading in the paper that there is a debate about legalizing same-sex marriage. I really think we should not get married because of this.\"\n \n Peter: \"I agree. The idea that same-sex marriage might be legal makes me think that you and I should cancel our planned wedding.\"\n \n How much sense does this make? \n \n I have visited the Netherlands on quite a few occasions. Amsterdam in particular is wild and liberal. Most foreigners know about the legalized prostitution there. The idea that a debate over same-sex marriage led people to question and abandon opposite-sex marriage is far-fetched. People in Amsterdam have questioned traditional ways of life for a long time. Some folks may be dismayed over that, but the questioning and challenging of traditional values there long predates the debate over same-sex marriage. There is no evidence that the debate over same-sex marriage caused this attitudinal change in the Netherlands, which happened before same-sex marriage became an issue. Even the folks quoted in the article cited by Archangel admit they have no evidence to support their speculation.\n\n \n Once again you mislead and ignore the facts of what Kurtz is saying. Here again is the link to the actual academics and the interviews they give explaining themselves. iMAPP.org | Institute for Marriage and Public Policy Here are 3 articles about the Dutch Scholars on same sex marriage, with interviews.

   "See the bolded? This is what is so pathetic about even trying to debate this issue with any of you in an honest way. You either don't understand or don't want to understand that it isn't about gay people marrying. That isn't what is destroying the concept of traditional marriage. It is the revised belief that marriage is no longer a sacred union between a husband and a wife who come together to have children who are a true reflection of themselves as ONE genetic unit.\n \n With gay marriage comes this dirty belief that marriage is all about the benefits you have claimed you were fighting for and insist that you can only receive through marriage rights. No matter that civil unions give all the legal benefits you once insisted you were fighting for marriage over. This is absolute evidence that the equal rights you scream for are just a ruse to get society to accept your unnatural sexual expression as right and normal. Nothing your community represents is honest or truthful.\n \n Your battle is a philosophical one which is solely dedicated to making what your sexual proclivity represents acceptable and seen as normal by the larger society, and you lie and deceive about every goal you strive to reach in order to reach that goal. You know as well as I do that homosexuals have all of the same human and civil rights that straights do. There is even hate crime legislation written specifically for homosexual protections which doesn't exist for straights. You dare to compare your agenda with what blacks suffered under during their civil rights struggle when if you were even partially right then the decision the California Supreme Court made yesterday would have been as illegal as slavery was.\n \n But will your side admit to that? NOooooooo!!! You will persist in lying and claiming some victim status which is designed to garner undeserved sympathy for an agenda which is founded upon lies and survives through guilt, deception and manipulation by twisting reality to serve your warped and unnatural world view. I could go on for pages but I realize I'm just wasting my time.\n\n \n \nYou are wasting your time, because your hysterical attack posts make people pay no attention to you. If you want to be heard, I recommend that you write in a more respectful, moderated tone. The reason people call you an anti-gay bigot is because your posts make you sound like an anti-gay bigot. And that prompts people to ignore you. \n \n You say the issue of gay marriage is not about gay people marrying. \n \n Of course it's about gay people marrying. \n \n Your remark is like saying the issue of women voting was not about women voting. For women it was. The opponents of women's suffrage argued the sky was falling, that women voting would destroy the family. They made arguments similar to those made by opponents of same-sex marriage today. Ultimately women got the vote, the sky did not fall, and the family was not destroyed. The horrible scenario painted by the anti-suffrage alarmists did not come true. Women got the vote, and life went on as before. The same thing is happening in states and nations where gay people now have the right to marry. Life goes on as before. The family is not destroyed, heterosexual marriage remains as it was before, and civilization has not crumbled. And as people see that the dire predictions of anti-gay alarmists do not come true, they come to support same-sex marriage. \n \n The issue of gay marriage is not about gay people marrying? For gay people it is. Gay people want to get married, for the same reasons that heterosexuals want to get married. Marriage is marriage. Same-sex marriage and opposite-sex marriage are the same. It's one thing. Gay people want the equal right to marry our spouses legally that heterosexuals have. For the same reasons.\n\n \n The only people I'm wasting my time on is people like you who deny the truth at all cost. But many people visit and read these arguments without comment maybe, but to assume they buy into the lies you represent is wishful thinking at best.",

I repeat that there is NO evidence of any causal relationship. As I have pointed out, the decline in opposite-sex marriage in these countries began well before same-sex marriage was legalized or even debated. And the decline has occurred not only in the Netherlands, but in other countries like Sweden as well.

   "Archie, Kurtz's junk has been refuted so many times it's a waste of internet space for you to keep dredging it up... emoticon_rolleyes\n But Kurtz's smoking gun is really just smoke and mirrors. Reports of the death of marriage in Scandinavia are greatly exaggerated; giving gay couples the right to wed did not lead to massive matrimonial flight by heterosexuals. \n \n Currently there are nine European countries that give marital rights to gay couples. In Scandinavia, Denmark (1989), Norway (1993), Sweden (1994), and Iceland (1996) pioneered a separate-and-not-quite-equal status for same-sex couples called \"registered partnership.\" (When they register, same-sex couples receive most of the financial and legal rights of marriage, other than the right to marry in a state church and the right to adopt children.) Since 2001, the Netherlands and Belgium have opened marriage to same-sex couples. \n \n Despite what Kurtz might say, the apocalypse has not yet arrived. In fact, the numbers show that heterosexual marriage looks pretty healthy in Scandinavia, where same-sex couples have had rights the longest. In Denmark, for example, the marriage rate had been declining for a half-century but turned around in the early 1980s. After the 1989 passage of the registered-partner law, the marriage rate continued to climb; Danish heterosexual marriage rates are now the highest they've been since the early 1970's. And the most recent marriage rates in Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are all higher than the rates for the years before the partner laws were passed. Furthermore, in the 1990s, divorce rates in Scandinavia remained basically unchanged. \n \n Of course, the good news about marriage rates is bad news for Kurtz's sky-is-falling argument. So, Kurtz instead focuses on the increasing tendency in Europe for couples to have children out of wedlock. Gay marriage, he argues, is a wedge that is prying marriage and parenthood apart. \n \n The main evidence Kurtz points to is the increase in cohabitation rates among unmarried heterosexual couples and the increase in births to unmarried mothers. Roughly half of all children in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark are now born to unmarried parents. In Denmark, the number of cohabiting couples with children rose by 25 percent in the 1990s. From these statistics Kurtz concludes that \" ... married parenthood has become a minority phenomenon,\" and-surprise-he blames gay marriage. \n \n But Kurtz's interpretation of the statistics is incorrect. Parenthood within marriage is still the norm-most cohabitating couples marry after they start having children. In Sweden, for instance, 70 percent of cohabiters wed after their first child is born. Indeed, in Scandinavia the majority of families with children are headed by married parents. In Denmark and Norway, roughly four out of five couples with children were married in 2003. In the Netherlands, a bit south of Scandinavia, 90 percent of heterosexual couples with kids are married. \n \n Kurtz is also mistaken in maintaining that gay unions are to blame for changes in heterosexual marriage patterns. In truth, the shift occurred in the opposite direction: Changes in heterosexual marriage made the recognition of gay couples more likely. In my own recent study conducted in the Netherlands, I found that the nine countries with partnership laws had higher rates of unmarried cohabitation than other European and North American countries before passage of the partner-registration laws. In other words, high cohabitation rates came first, gay partnership laws followed.\n \n A subtler version of Kurtz's argument states that the advent of registered partnership caused an increase in cohabitation rates and children born outside of marriage (nonmarital births). If that were true, then we would expect to see two patterns: Cohabitation rates and the nonmarital birth rate would rise more quickly within a country after it passed partner registration laws; and the rise in the nonmarital birth rate would be greater in countries that had such laws than in countries that do not recognize same-sex partnerships.\n \n Kurtz's argument fails both tests. From 1970 to 1980, the Danish nonmarital birth rate tripled, from 11 percent to 33 percent. Over the next 10 years, it rose again to 46 percent and then stopped rising in 1990s after the passage of the 1989 partnership law. Norway's big surge occurred in the 1980's, with an increase from 16 percent to 39 percent. In the decade after Norway recognized same-sex couples (in 1993), the nonmarital birth rate first rose slightly, then, after a couple of years, leveled off at 50 percent. \n \n Cohabitation rates tell a similar story. In Denmark, from 1980 to 1989, the number of unmarried, cohabiting couples with children rose by 70 percent, but the same figure rose by only 28 percent from 1989 to 2000-the decade after Denmark introduced its partner-registration laws-and then stopped rising. From 2000 to 2004, the number has increased by a barely perceptible 0.3 percent. The fact that rates of cohabitation and nonmarital births either slowed down or completely stopped rising after the passage of partnership laws shows that the laws had no effect on heterosexual behavior.\n \n Furthermore, the change in nonmarital births was exactly the same in countries with partnership laws as it was in countries without. The eight countries that recognized registered partners at some point in the decade from 1989 to 2000 saw an increase in the average nonmarital birth rate from 36 percent in 1991 to 44 percent in 2000, an eight percentage point increase. Among the EU countries that didn't recognize partners (plus Switzerland), the average rate of nonmarital births rose from 15 percent to 23 percent-also an eight-point increase. \n \n No matter how you slice the demographic data, rates of nonmarital births and cohabitation do not increase as a result of the passage of laws that give same-sex partners the right to registered partnership. To put it simply: Giving gay couples rights does not inexplicably cause heterosexuals to flee marriage, as Kurtz would have us believe. Looking at the long-term statistical trends, it seems clear that the changes in heterosexuals' marriage and parenting decisions would have occurred anyway, even in the absence of gay marriage.\n \n And all the conservative hand-wringing seems especially unnecessary when you consider the various incentives that encourage American heterosexual couples to marry. By marrying, U.S. couples obtain health-insurance coverage, pensions, and Social Security survivor benefits. Plus, in the United States we are required by law to be financially responsible for our spouses in bad times, since we don't have Scandinavian-style welfare programs to fall back on. \n \n In addition, American society already wrestles with the social tensions that Kurtz claims have occurred as a result of gay marriage in Scandinavia: deepening divisions over gay issues in churches, the increasing acceptance of lesbian and gay relationships in the media, and the occasional radical voice arguing for the abolition of marriage. Yet heterosexual couples keep getting married-more than 2 million of them every year.\n \n Concerns about the impact of gay marriage on heterosexual behavior are not unique to the United States, of course. European countries that recognize same-sex couples initially had their worriers, too. Over time, however, it became clear that civilization and family life would survive the recognition of gay couples' rights. Even the conservative governments that came into power have not tried to repeal rights for gay couples in France and the Netherlands. \n \n Both demographic data and common sense show that the dire predictions of Dobson and Kurtz are just cultural prenuptial jitters. Now that gay and lesbian couples are marrying in Massachusetts, we'll have a home-grown social experiment that will undoubtedly compare to that of Europe: Letting gay couples say \"I do\" does not lead to heterosexuals saying \"I don't.\"\n Did gay marriage destroy marriage in Scandinavia? - By M.V. Lee Badgett - Slate MagazineI've read Kurtz's junk before. I know the games he tries to play.\n *See gay marriage? See this other thing over here which is scary? They MUST be related, and you MUST assume it so cause it's just So-o-o-o-o scary!\" emoticon_rolleyes \n Lee Badgett provides an excellent rebuttal to Kurtz's nonsense.\n \n It's amusing to watch Archie be asked REPEATEDLY for what EXACTLY the link is, but he can't put it into words.\n \n All he can do is sputter and say \"read this\", when he won't even admit that the \"this\" that he offers doesn't even explain WHAT the link supposedly is.\n \n HOW will the existence of gay marriage cause:\n a) straight couples to divorce,\n b) straight couples not to marry,\n c) make the wife a lesbian, \n d) make the husband gay, or\n e) ANY of the above?\n \n Archie, in YOUR own words without telling us to read something else that you obviously can't explain yourself, can you JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION?",

So let me correct that right now, with an excerpt: Stanley Kurtz on Gay Marriage on National Review Online\n\n \n But this isn't even evidence? You pointed out that others are ignoring your \"evidence\" but they are actually going right at it so I won't bother to go through it much myself unless you want to point to something specific that hasn't been covered by others. Ok, I'll respond to a couple of items in your post.\n \n \nAfter citing a raft of statistics documenting the decline of Dutch marriage, here is some of what these scholars had to say: \n\n \n Ok, so let's go ahead and assume there is a \"raft of statistics\" documenting the decline of Dutch marriage. (Which I don't, but let's go with it) So? How do you know this is because of gay marriage? Others have covered this, but that's quite a leap of faith. It's like saying gays are responsible for the economic meltdown this country is going through because as gay marriage has become legal in more and more states the economy has gotten worse. This is not evidence, it's not fact, it's an opinion and it's all published in the \"Clinton Chronicles\" favorite conspiracy rag. Now, where it's posted doesn't mean it's not automatically not true but it's highly dubious. In a debate, if you want to change someone's mind you don't grab from sources that most would consider unreliable. Trust me, most (of those who have even heard of them) would consider sources like the National Review or Weekly Standard to be absolutely abhorrent when it comes to truth telling. I don't care if they are a right wing or left wing publication, they have had challenges in the past.\n \n But, this is the best evidence you can come up with?\n \n \n...there is as yet no definitive scientific evidence to suggest the long campaign for the legalization of same-sex marriage contributed to these harmful trends.\n\n \n BOOM! Stop right there, this pretty says it all. There's is nothing but opinion in this piece and just because someone is connecting imaginary dots does not mean they are right, you still need evidence for that, something a little more stable than \"well, it all happened around the same time.\" It's quite laughable.\n \n Oh, and even more \"evidence\".\n \n \nThere are undoubtedly other factors that have contributed to the decline of the institution of marriage in our country. Further scientific research is needed to establish the relative importance of all these factors. At the same time, we wish to note that enough evidence of marital decline already exists to raise serious concerns about the wisdom of the efforts to deconstruct marriage in its traditional form.\n\n \n Other factors you say? But they don't even tell you what they are? Further scientific research is needed? You call this evidence? I call it a loose timeline that may or may not be correct because I already don't trust the author and what he considers evidence or facts. He's obviously pushing an agenda, what for I have no idea. If he just said two guys getting it on is icky then I'd have more respect for his honesty, instead he's making leaps and bounds in assumption. Why would one do such a thing and why would one (regardless of your opinion on gay marriage) look at this article and even remotely take it seriously? I mean, if you want to be honest throw this trash out and find something that doesn't start off the bat telling you that they don't have any proof, scientific or otherwise. You do share something about assumptions with the author. For example anyone who disagrees with you or protests for something you are against you call them names and pretend they are out of the mainstream and abnormal. It's an assumption on your part, broad brushing people you don't know or have any interest in getting to know. \n \n \n You can read an interview with two of the letter's signers here, and a front-page news story about the letter in the Dutch paper, Reformatorisch Dagblad, here.\n \n UNDENIABLE DECLINE\n During last week's Federal Marriage Amendment debate, many senators referred to the Dutch scholars' statement, and to marital decline in Scandinavia and the Netherlands. Of course, you probably haven't heard about that, because, for the most part, the American press has refused to report the story.\n\n \n Refused to or could care less? Is this guy telling me that there hasn't been a voice in the media against same sex marriage? Please.\n \n \nEven so, gay-marriage advocates are worried. M. V. Lee Badgett, research director for the Institute for Gay and Lesbian Strategic Studies, has issued a new critique of my work on Scandinavia and the Netherlands. In \"Unhealthy Half-Truths,\" I refuted Badgett's first attack. Now she's back. Badgett's critique of my work is long on statistical tricks and short on engagement with my actual argument.\n\n \n Yeah, if he says so (without facts) it must be true.\n \n \nThe bottom line is the neither Badgett nor anyone else has been able to get around the fact that marriage in both Scandinavia and the Netherlands is in deep decline. In Scandinavia, that decline began before same-sex registered partnerships were established, but has continued apace ever since. In the Netherlands, marital decline accelerated dramatically, in tandem with the growing campaign for gay marriage.\n\n \n What? I'm not sure but wasn't it the author's point that it was gay marriage as the cause of the decline (if real) in marriage in Scandinavia? Not just the decline itself? Do you see how he switched it up there? But he also states that the decline in marriage started before gay marriage was legal and he's complaining because after gay marriage became legal nothing changed except for the Netherlands? How to you buy this garbage? From how I read this overall in the Scandinavian countries nothing changed after gay marriage with the exception of the Netherlands which he says (if you still believe him) that this one country has marital decline and somehow it's that must be because of teh gays. There is absolutely no logic to be found here and it appears that this has been written so as to preach to the choir.\n \n \nThis is the evidence which Ohio Prof wants to dismiss as a lot of nonsense. Which I'm sure you too will support since this evidence opposes what you want to accept as right and normal. Why should you allow facts and reality to get in the way, right? \n\n \n Right and normal? Facts? There are no facts here, just opinion. This is why you are most likely laughed at often and probably one of those who frustrates others because you just don't debate honestly. Find some real evidence or facts, trust me there are other pieces written which are more difficult to debunk than this and they are also full of it. \n \n \nHere is more which you will want to make excuses and denials for. But remember, this isn't some anti gay conservative making these statements. They are being made by Northern Europeans who supported gay marriage originallyiMAPP.org | Institute for Marriage and Public Policy\n\n \n I'll take a look at this one later today.\n \n \nThose who fire-bomb abortion clinics are not militants, they are terrorists and murderers who deserve to be punished as such. You see bm, I don't support certain types of violence just because I support the cause they oppose, such as abortion.\n\n \n I agree, they are terrorists and if any gays or liberals fire-bombed a church then I'd call them terrorists too, doesn't happen though. But if pro-life supporters protested in the streets and were arrested for blocking intersections I wouldn't be calling them militant either.",

   "I don't doubt that democracy procedures an imperfect result but how else do you determine what rights are without resorting to a dicatorship or some kind?\n\n \"imperfect result\"?\n I don't think you can even call it \"protection\".\n Protection implies that you have some means of stopping the abuse.\n With \"democratic vote\", the abuse simply DOES NOT TAKE PLACE if the majority doesn't feel like perpetuating the abuse.\n \n 1) There is no threat to a person's rights if the majority agrees with the \"right\".\n 2) The threat to a person's rights comes when the majority wants to DISREGARD the right, in which case you have no protection.\n \n I think the real problem is not \"determining\" those rights. Those rights have already been realized.\n Free speech. Warrants. Freedom of religion. Right to privacy. Right to marriage.\n \n The real problem comes up when people want to IGNORE the fact that those ARE rights, when they want to \"forget\" about it.\n \n You, Steeeeve, are a rare exception in a person who will say \"marriage is not a right\", and AT THE SAME TIME follow that statement to its bloody end of invalidating \"Loving v Virginia\".\n \n MOST people I talk with (who oppose gay marriage) want to ACKNOWLEDGE marriage as a right for the purposes of Loving v Virginia, but then IGNORE the right when it comes to gay marriage. \n And THAT is the real risk for \"democracy\" as a \"protector\" of rights. People predominantly are happy to say \"it's a right\" for things they like, but then IGNORE the same right for things they don't like.\n \n \n \nNow if God came down here and said \"I am ruling and here is what the rights are\" than so be it (and I believe rights come from Him anyway) but people have different views and it is hard to say why my view is better than yours or yours better than mine.\n\n We don't even have to go to God.\n I am just talking about CONSISTENCY in simple rights observance and recognition.\n Not saying \"well, as a white male I have a right to a fair trial and jurisprudence\", and then in WW II turning around and allowing Japanese internment camps.\n \n \n \nI think the courts are more rigid but their constraints are only that they have to agree with 4 other people. This is basically a rule by very few.\n\n Part of the reason why checks and balances come in.\n \n \n \nIf we have 5 people up there that say gay marriage is not a right than changing that will be about as hard as changing abortion laws. Very rigid and very undemocratic and very against the constitution.\n\n I whole-heartedly disagree on the allegation of \"against the constitution\".\n It would be \"against the constitution\" to neuter the courts of their power.\n They are the THIRD BRANCH of our three-tiered federal government system.\n \n By your approach, you would make them virtually irrelevant.\n \n \n \nIt is not a procedure because it is unworkable and never was a procedure.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n To be more objective about this, what you really should be saying is you disagree with it.\n The system DOES function.\n It IS a procedure.\n \n You don't like it, but that's not the same thing as \"unworkable\".\n \n \n \nIt comes across as a result first and a procedure second...ie you work from \"here is the result we feel is best and lets make a way to get there\". This is what a policy maker is supposed to do.\n\n I disagree with your assessment.\n It's an unbased accusation.\n \n This accusation typically comes from people who are operating EXACTLY AS IT DESCRIBES.\n People who don't like the result, ergo they criticize the procedure.\n \n \n \nPerhaps I need to define it better but I don't have time right now....Our current nominee for supreme court shows this best. She believes the result is most important. So in this case it is achieving gay rights.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n I think the recent California court decision is a perfect DISPROVAL of your allegations.\n The California court obviously SUPPORTS the right to gay marriage, but they UPHELD the constitution amendment.\n The system worked!\n \n I personally feel there is validity in questioning the amount of votes that were given for Prop 8, and whether the nature of the constitutional change was significant enough to require the HIGHER LEVEL majority vote, but if that is not viewed as valid then the amendment must stand.\n \n You're posting on a thread which provides an example DISPROVING your allegation.\n \n \n \nThis is justified, basically, by saying the courts have the power to do whatever. It is a result oriented approach to the law. This is evident in many of the protesters who wanted their way no matter what.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n Think about it.\n The courts DID NOT RULE that way. The protestors lost.\n \n But by YOUR rationale, if gay marriage opposition is at 50% +1, and that \"+1\" changes his mind, then gay marriage automatically goes from \"it's not a right\" to \"it's a right\".\n It could even be based on somebody paying the guy $50 for his vote, and you WOULD NEVER KNOW.\n And that could be based on nothing more substantial than finding out his kid was gay.\n \n At least with the current court system, despite your false representation, they DO HAVE TO put forth their logic and reasoning.\n The real problem here is that you DISAGREE with how the system works.\n But putting forth the logic and reasoning is a heck of a lot more \"protective\" than a mind change that could be based on anything.\n \n \n \nThey even stated they would protest against the decision if it went against their way....not even bothering to read the thing to see if it made logical sense.\n\n And the same could be said of the original people who protested the original ruling which made marriage a right... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Quite frankly, I don't think you appreciate how your observations TRULY IMPACT A DEMOCRACY type \"rights protection\".\n There, you SOLELY embrace *people want what they want even if there is no logical sense*, and that is ALL that is relied upon.\n \n \n \nAgain, this approach is popular because it assumes that judges will push for \"justice\" (as a loose term) and it is faster at achieving results because you only have to convince 5 people instead of millions. The other approach pretty much assumes the courts are the weakest branch and will make decisions not on what is popular or what may be \"just\" but what the law actually says to do. \n\n Quit frankly, by your approach you lose MOST of the \"checks\" that the judicial system has on the congressional and executive branches.\n \n And you aren't appreciating that it isn't JUST \"convincing 5 people instead of millions\".\n You have to convince those 5 people that the CONSTITUTION protects the rights.\n The \"millions\" could be swayed by nothing more than KNOWING a gay person, and their opinion can be completely irrelevant and contradictory of the constitution. \n \n \n \nConsider the following example: A contact says \"you will pay reasonable rent for 100 years\" and at the time it was known (but not written in the contract) that reasonable meant fair market value. Fifty years later this contract is still intact and fair market value for rent is, for some reason, grossly more than surrounding places and causes this person suffering because they are contractual bound to pay the rent. \n The two approaches would probably result in this:\n Procedure approach: 'reasonable' has and always meant fair market value so that is what it is...you are bound by that.\n Result based approach: 'the contract said reasonable rent because it wanted to be fair and clearly it isn't fair because the person is suffering and others around him don't have to pay as much...the rent is reduced'.\n \n the result based approach really just created a new contract based on nothing more than the judges opinion. This is dangerous and makes a court that IS supposed to be the weakest branch the most powerful.\n\n The judge's opinion would have to be based on the existing law, precedent, and constitution.\n \n And what does your method have to say on the matter?\n If society is made up primarily of people who rent as opposed to people who rent out to others, then a \"vote\" on the issue could easily say (based on self-interest) that it means whatever is cheaper for the person paying rent...\n \n At least with the courts, there are mechanisms in place to help remove bias.\n On your end, you're asking for a different system which has elements COMPLETELY RELYING on bias, and their bias is IRRELEVANT to your process.\n \n \n \nAll created by the courts over various time based on nothing more than their opinion. Intermediate scrutiny was basically the brain child of Oconner. Out of no where.\n It applies to more than race but clearly race was a motivator like you say. Something being vague also doesn't mean judges decide what it can or can't mean. Refer back to my example. \"Reasonable\" is a vague term but it meant something to those who adopted it.\n\n There is historical precedent establishing a MEANING FOR those phrases.\n \n \n \nIf you are to say reasonable means what a judge thinks it should mean at any given time than you render the term meaningless so why even bother with it? And if you don't know what a vague term means how you can rule on it? I'd say they left it broad but meaningful. \"Due process of law\" clearly means what it meant in the 4th amendment...why would it have a substantive aspect now(for example)?\n\n Why are you focusing on \"due process\"?\n It's the EQUAL PROTECTION part that is the item of typical concern in these cases.\n \"nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n THAT is where the compelling state interest comes in.\n \n And THAT is the phrase which, if you were to take a \"literal\" interpretation to, would obviously lead to a recognition of gay marriage.\n Gay couples are clearly not \"equally protected\", ergo it's violated! emoticon_xagree\n \n \n \nThe obvious conclusion is that they meant for the 14th amendment to encompass MORE than just race.\n They wanted it to BE an issue that needed to be interpreted. \n\n \nYes to the first part and no to the second part. That doesn't logically follow. You can't get from \"we have broad terms\" to \"therefore the courts should decide the meaning\".\n\n It's the COURTS' JOB to interpret.\n That is what they do.\n \n \n \nThis is almost an admission that the writers had no idea what it means. It can be broad and still have meaning as well.\n\n Actually, the issue is that it is VAGUE. It provides NO boundaries or limits, by itself.\n It doesn't say \"this applies to race but not to gays\". There is no verbage there that can establish why one group should be covered, but another should not.\n \n And I reject the idea that this means \"the writers had no idea\".\n It means the writers were wise enough to allow OTHERS to recognize the concept of \"equal protection\" for what it is.\n \n \n \nLook at the word \"speech\"...this is actually a broad term and had meaning at the time of adoption. My point is you should always default to what the writers and adopters meant and not what a current judge feels it should mean. This follows to the 14th amendment.\n\n Again, the guys who decided that blacks were 3/5 of a person?\n I'm sorry, but I have more faith in the words of the constitution than I have for them.\n \n \n \nWhether it should or shouldn't is not the question. The question is who should decide. I feel the people should and not the judges because they are a slave to the people.\n\n And I feel you just contradicted yourself.\n We just went from \"we need to stick to the literal meaning of the constitution as established by the founders\"...\n ... to \"the people, who can utilize any factor they want to, even DISREGARDING the constitution, should decide\".\n \n I don't see the logic in that.\n \n \n \nLeave it up to the hospital.\n\n Quite frankly, on this one you have your individual opinion which contradicts the majority you want to stick with.\n A majority voted in the marriage laws. Ergo, it is not left up to the hospital.\n \n Too many people have seen what can happen if it is left up to the hospital. Racial or sexual orientation prejudice can come into play, making life difficult for the couple involved just cause somebody is a bigot.\n \"The people\" have already decided this is part of a \"right\"...",

No one likes to be told that they harbor prejudice. So they come up with all sorts of ways to try to rationalize barring same-sex marriage, to make it sound like it is rooted in anything other than prejudice. People did the same thing to try to rationalize barring inter-racial marriage back when the common belief was the inter-racial marriage was wrong and should be barred by law. \n \n Another reason why people object to people pointing out parallels between the laws barring inter-racial marriage and the laws barring same-sex marriage is because they think that requiring spouses to be of different sexes is fundamental to marriage, that it is fundamental to the \"definition\" of marriage, whereas they do not believe that marriage was ever \"defined\" by racial separation. There are a couple of problems with this. First, people are often unaware of the degree to which marriage for most of American history was viewed as requiring racial separation. For most of American history until recently, most Americans regarded inter-racial marriage as wrong and as shocking and horrible. Inter-racial marriage was associated with inter-racial sex, and thousands of black men accused or believed to have had sex with white women were lynched in the decades from the end of Reconstruction until well into the 20th century. The perpetrators of lynchings commonly claimed that this kind of ritualized torture and murder was a justified response to a black man raping or having sexual relations with a white woman. As late as 1967, Gallup polls indicated that 72% of Americans surveyed believed that inter-racial marriage was wrong. That was the year the Supreme Court struck down the laws barring inter-racial marriage. Many, perhaps most, Americans today are unaware of this. They tend to minimize the popular opposition, the often violent opposition, to inter-racial marriage and inter-racial sexual relations. They do not realize the extent to which people in the past viewed marriage as requiring racial exclusivity. That black people were not to marry white people was taken as a given, as part of what some would call the \"definition\" of marriage. That's why it was codified as law.\n \n The folks who oppose same-sex marriage today tend to emphasize what they see as the moral unacceptability of same-sex marriage, while not acknowledging the extent to which inter-racial marriage was viewed as morally unacceptable throughout most of American history until recently. \n \n The folks who oppose same-sex marriage today tend simply to repeat over and over that the \"definition\" of marriage is \"one man and one woman.\" They don't question whether this is really true or why it is necessarily true. Marriage has been different in different cultures and in different times, and the belief in limiting marriage to one man and one woman is culturally specific. It is not universal. It's also not clear why people are so committed to marriage only between one man and one woman. People who believe in this rarely give a reason, except to repeat over and over that this is the \"definition\" of marriage. But why? And why should marriage be limited in this way? Sometimes people say it's because of reproduction, that marriage is supposed to support reproduction. The problem with this argument is that it assumes that biological reproduction is the only way in which couples have children, and that people who cannot reproduce biologically together cannot have children. That's not true today. It's not true of infertile opposite-sex couples, and it's not true of same-sex couples either. Same-sex couples are really no different from infertile opposite-sex couples. Both can and do raise children, and if a purpose of marriage is to provide support for children, then it makes no sense to deny this support to the children of same-sex couples. \n \n There is a process that people commonly go through when something they have been taught to believe all their lives is thrown into question. The process involves initial resistance to the new understanding, a refusal to give up the old way of seeing. The resistance may take the form of anger. Then there is usually an attempt to rationalize the old way of seeing, in order to continue hanging on to the old belief. Gradually, the person comes to accept the new belief, perhaps initially by trying to incorporate the old and the new belief side-by-side in their thinking. This may be the step in which people say they are opposed to same-sex marriage, but they are fine with civil unions. They are seeking a way to hang onto their old and exclusive ideas about what marriage is supposed to be while simultaneously incorporating new beliefs about gay people and about same-sex couples. It's a sort of compromise step. Finally, perhaps grudgingly, they accept the new belief. \n \n I think that a growing number of Americans are in the process of rethinking their old beliefs about gay people. One reason I think it's important for us to turn to legislative initiatives now rather than relying exclusively on court rulings is because we need to educate more people, to encourage the process of rethinking about gay people. Court actions often lead to a popular backlash, as we have seen. People are stunned by a court ruling, and they have not gone through the rethinking process. They often react with anger. In contrast, a legislative approach more directly and systematically encourages the rethinking process. I think that court rulings can also eventually lead to rethinking, once people accept the result of the ruling and see that it has not caused the sky to fall. But court cases need to be balanced by efforts on our part to win voters, to win ordinary people over to the side of equality. That can happen through referendum intiatives and through legislative efforts.",

   "I think that people object to people pointing out the parallels between the laws barring inter-racial marriage and the laws barring same-sex marriage for several reasons. One reason is because they personally think the laws barring inter-racial marriage were wrong, that they were rooted in prejudice. But they personally have not come to the same belief about the laws barring same-sex marriage, and they don't like anyone to suggest that what they believe may be an example of prejudice. \n \n Another reason why people object to people pointing out parallels between the laws barring inter-racial marriage and the laws barring same-sex marriage is because they think that requiring spouses to be of different sexes is fundamental to marriage\n\n \n You forgot (or didn't realize) a third possibility: that people often aren't going to accept an analogy across the board as a perfect fit when we are talking about two different issues. Each has its own merits. In terms of prejudice, the analogy can indeed fit. But in terms of how marriage is defined and legal merits, they are not the same issue. And again, one is much more of a moralistic issue than the other was. People sometimes take issue because at some point, it really is a separate issue. I know that's the reason I take issue with it, to some extent.\n \n I think the main reason gay marriage proponents often always try to invoke the interracial marriage issue is because it's an example of something that has become a moral high ground, and they want gay marriage to also be a moral-high-ground sort of issue. But the moral standard of gay marriage isn't yet set by society. It's still a question up for debate. For now, it can still also be compared to issues like polygamy or incest marriages. It can go either way.\n \n \nThe folks who oppose same-sex marriage today tend simply to repeat over and over that the \"definition\" of marriage is \"one man and one woman.\" They don't question whether this is really true or why it is necessarily true.\n\n \n Then if marriage is going to be malleable as an institution--'broadenable'--where are you going to draw the line? What is the reasonable limit of where something should be considered a marriage or not? That's the thing--proponents of gay marriage sometimes don't seem to realize that this isn't MERELY a debate about GAY marriage--it's a debate about MARRIAGE, period, and where the standards are going to be set. If that pandora's box is opened (as it now IS in some states), at what point does it close? What types of marriage would you NOT allow? And why? Why would their forms of marriage be less important than yours? because you've started this ball rolling. You've opened this door. And what I often find is that gay marriage proponents want to avoid these questions--the very questioned they themselves have created.\n \n \nMarriage has been different in different cultures and in different times, and the belief in limiting marriage to one man and one woman is culturally specific. It is not universal.\n\n \n If marriage is not 'universal' then there is no less grounds to CHANGE it from what it is, either, on this basis. If it's not universal, then we could leave it between a man and woman and call THAT the standard. No one own the standard for which there is no universal standard, and that includes gay people.\n \n \nConservatives usually say they advocate maximizing human freedom. Marriage equality gives people the freedom to choose a spouse without restriction as to gender. \n\n \n But they also don't like people squatting on other peoples' institutions, and that's what they see happening. Conservatism may involve protecting institutions sometimes, not only individuals. \n \n \nMarriage in Massachusetts is the same institution that it was before same-sex marriage was legalized. \n\n \n No, not really. It was between a man and a woman before. Now it has been broadened--the line of what constitutes marriage has been moved outward. It's not the same.",

A judge should be conservative.\n\n \n Do you feel that way about the decision in Brown v. Board of Education? That was a group of unelected judges making a huge decision that changed the lives of millions. And it led to what white Southerners called \"massive resistance\" to the decision. Southern whites in Congress issued what they called the Southern Manifesto denouncing the decision. Was the Brown decision an example of the Supreme Court usurping the rights of the people?\n \n You say, \"Have some faith in people.\" Would we have had an end to racial segregation if we had relied solely on the \"people\" to end it, without the courts? Would the South have voted to end racial segregation? \n \n Remember that it was a series of court rulings that brought down segregation laws before the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court declared interstate bus segregation unconstitutional, segregated schools unconstitutional, local bus segregation unconstitutional.\n \n Without the Supreme Court, would the \"people\" of the South have voted segregation down? Should we have had \"faith\" in them? These are counter-factual questions, of course. But they are questions to consider when folks denounce the Supreme Court for interpreting the constitution as protecting fundamental rights. \n \n When the Supreme Court rules that a law passed by the people or their legislatures is an unconstitutional abrogation of the people's rights, they are saying, in essence, that the people who framed the constitution or who ratified amendments to it called for protection of the rights that are now being abrogated. The Supreme Court, in interpreting the constitution, IS expressing the will of the people....the will of those who created and ratified the constitution and its amendments. They are saying that the will of the people as a whole, who created and ratified the constitution, is of greater force than the will of people who have crafted specific state or federal laws. \n \n I think the argument by conservatives that \"unelected judges\" have been usurping the will of the people is false. The Supreme Court interprets the meaning of the constitution. The fact that some may disagree with how the Supreme Court interprets the constitution does not mean the Supreme Court is making law. It means that some people disagree with the Supreme Court's interpretation of what the law is, of what the constitution means. We choose scholars and people who have studied constitutional law and history for the Supreme Court because they have studied and thought carefully about what the constitution means.\n \n Do I think the Supreme Court is ever wrong? I do disagree with Supreme Court rulings. But I don't denounce the Supreme Court as an institution just because I disagree with what they rule. Back in 1905, the Supreme Court ruled that the state of New York could not regulate the working hours of bakers there because such a law violated the due process clause of the 14th amendment. This was the case of Lochner v. New York. The Supreme Court declared that there is a right to liberty of contract protected by the constitution, and that states could not violate this liberty by enacting protective labor legislation. It was the beginning of what came to be known as the Lochner Era, the era when the Supreme Court viewed the 14th amendment as protecting a substantive right to liberty of contract under the due process clause. It was an era when the Supreme Court asserted the doctrine of substantive due process that conservatives today usually hate. But in the Lochner era, it was a conservative Supreme Court that asserted the doctrine of substantive due process. \n \n Today, while the doctrine of substantive due process survives, the Supreme Court has abandoned the idea that the constitution protects a substantive right to liberty of contract that prohibits state regulation to protect workers. We have state laws limiting working hours, setting minimum wages, etc. Does this mean that the Supreme Court in the Lochner era was nothing but a bunch of unelected judges making up the law? I don't think so. I disagree strongly with the Supreme Court ruling in Lochner v. New York, as most people today do. But I think that most people now simply interpret the constitution differently than they did. We can disagree with the Supreme Court's interpretations without seeing the Court as violating their duties or undermining the \"will of the people.\" The Supreme Court seeks to determine what the broad \"will of the people\" was in crafting the constitution. With judicial review, the Supreme Court is trying to determine what the will of the people was in crafting the constitution, and they are judging whether our current laws violate that broader popular will. \n \n People often argue that the constitution does not say anything about same-sex marriage. It doesn't say anything specifically about marriage at all. It doesn't say anything about school segregation either or about bus segregation, or about segregation at all. Does that mean that the Supreme Court had no business striking down the segregation laws?\n \n The 14th amendment is written in broad language, not specific language. The history of the framing of the amendment strongly suggests that the framers intended it to apply broadly to all \"persons\" and to a broad array of rights. It does not refer specificially to race or to former slaves as does the 15th amendment, which the framers intended to be specific and narrow, to prohibit state discrimination in voting by race. The Supreme Court has a long history of interpreting the 14th amendment as protecting all kinds of persons and a variety of rights. We may disagree with the Supreme Court's interpretation of the amendment, and we may see the Court as allowing rights to run amuck or something, but this does not mean the Court is simply making up law. They are just interpreting the amendment in ways that some people disagree with. The Supreme Court has always encountered disagreement by some people in the ways in which it interprets the constitution.",

   "The real problem comes up when people want to IGNORE the fact that those ARE rights, when they want to \"forget\" about it.\nWell I'd agree with this but I base rights in a variety of ways. For example you have rights that I feel are inherent. This isn't very helpful in terms of protection because our country has developed a system for how rights are protected...ie a democratic way. The constitution, among other things, sets up a system for how rights are protected and who protects them. The constitution has a few listed directly while the vast majority are held to the state and people with direct language stating the federal government shouldn't intervene. I'll address this next.\n \n \nYou, Steeeeve, are a rare exception in a person who will say \"marriage is not a right\", and AT THE SAME TIME follow that statement to its bloody end of invalidating \"Loving v Virginia\".\nI'd like to clarify that I don't think it is a constitutional right such as free speech. the \"right of marriage\" is only protected in a few ways by the constitution. \n \n 1) the lack of the right in the constitution doesn't mean the federal government can assume control over that right and control it/regulate it (see 9th amendment).\n 2) The right is left up to the states and/or people (see 10th amendment)\n \n So to me the state of Virginia can do whatever they want with marriage because it isn't a constitutional right. The state can ban marriage in my opinion. \n \n The whole idea behind the constitution was not to give power into a few number of hands but power to as many people as possible because you can easily manipulate a few people but you can't do it to millions. \n \n \nBy your approach, you would make them virtually irrelevant.\n\n They are supposed to be the weakest branch. Because of this their power is limited to taking what the law says and applying it to situations. This isn't irrelevant and it sometimes isn't easy. If you have 5 people dictate policy than you make congress irrelevant and frankly this is what the courts do when they decide meaning based upon nothing more than how they feel that day (an exaggeration but hopefully you get my point). \n \n \nI think the recent California court decision is a perfect DISPROVAL of your allegations.\n The California court obviously SUPPORTS the right to gay marriage, but they UPHELD the constitution amendment.\n The system worked!\nIt doesn't fail everytime and this case would be very hard to claim otherwise. But it is a good example of how procedure is to be followed even when it might be the wrong thing to do. Doing something right one time doesn't mean you do it right everytime. \n \n \nBut by YOUR rationale, if gay marriage opposition is at 50% +1, and that \"+1\" changes his mind, then gay marriage automatically goes from \"it's not a right\" to \"it's a right\".\nCorrect. If that one person changes his mind than the right will exist in state law (or whatever).\n \n \nAt least with the current court system, despite your false representation, they DO HAVE TO put forth their logic and reasoning.\n The real problem here is that you DISAGREE with how the system works.\nI disagree that it is legitimate. The federalist papers talked about this in length. Having the courts decide policy is having a rule by a few. Presenting \"logic and reason\" is not going to have a good outcome because logic and reason are different for everyone. Nine lawyers are no better at determining what is moral or what should be a right than you or I. Thus you vote on issues like this.\n \n What happens when you get 5 judges on the supreme court that say gay marriage is not a right? If you claim they are the ones that decide rights than you pretty much have no recourse. You certainly can't say they are wrong because you would be claiming they are the ones that decide these things. \n \n \nQuite frankly, I don't think you appreciate how your observations TRULY IMPACT A DEMOCRACY type \"rights protection\".\n There, you SOLELY embrace *people want what they want even if there is no logical sense*, and that is ALL that is relied upon.\nThis is what our constitution calls for. People could vote to ban the color blue if they wanted to. The courts are not there to decide if a law makes sense to them or not. That makes them the greatest power.\n \n \nQuit frankly, by your approach you lose MOST of the \"checks\" that the judicial system has on the congressional and executive branches.\nNo it doesn't. They only serve to protect the people from the government. So if congress bans posting on internet forums than the court comes along and says \"no, the people said you can't do that without an amendment\". \n \n \nThe judge's opinion would have to be based on the existing law, precedent, and constitution.\nI was merely pointing out the two different approaches to the law.\n \n \nAnd what does your method have to say on the matter?\n If society is made up primarily of people who rent as opposed to people who rent out to others, then a \"vote\" on the issue could easily say (based on self-interest) that it means whatever is cheaper for the person paying rent...\n \n At least with the courts, there are mechanisms in place to help remove bias.\n On your end, you're asking for a different system which has elements COMPLETELY RELYING on bias, and their bias is IRRELEVANT to your process.\nMy method preserves freedom and doesn't dictate it. You have the freedom to enter a bad contract and pay the consequences of it. If something isn't fair doesn't make it not \"free\". The courts also do NOT remove bias. In fact, this is the strongest case for me. You only need 5 bias people in a court and having an approach that looks at \"empathy\" for example automatically adds bias. Any approach that doesn't look at the actual meaning as adopted by the people of any provisions in the constitution is inherently adding bias to the system. \n \n Look at my example. If you have those facts a judge that only looks at the law and what it says has to go with an unfair option and rule the person continue the payments. If a judge looks at what the law should be and what is right and fair than \"fair\" and \"right\" is really something personal to each of us (not that it is relative). So you will take a bias approach based upon your own circumstances, beliefs, and experiences. \n \n \nThere is historical precedent establishing a MEANING FOR those phrases.\nThey were developed in court cases...there is no historical evidence from the adoption of the amendment. \n \n \nWhy are you focusing on \"due process\"?\n It's the EQUAL PROTECTION part that is the item of typical concern in these cases.\n \"nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n THAT is where the compelling state interest comes in.\n\"Compelling State Interest is more often associated with due process as you can only deny someone a \"fundamental right\" via a compelling state interest. It is used it equal protection sometimes though (via another evolution). But it doesn't matter. Compelling state interest has no basis in the equal protection clause. There are zero historical documents at the time of adoption or even directly after that you need to convince the courts of a \"compelling state interest\"...whatever that even means (as it is meaningless). In fact, it is hard to even know what that clause means as their isn't much to support a meaning. \n \n \nIt's the COURTS' JOB to interpret.\n That is what they do.\nInterpret doesn't mean make up meaning to. Meaning is already set. Interpret is merely an action, in this case, to apply facts to a law that already has meaning and see if there is a violation. If I \"interpret\" your quote to mean \"It's the COURTS' JOB to replace Congress and rule the world\" you'd probably say i misrepresent your words. This is because your words have meaning and no one gets to determine what is or isn't going on in your head. \n \n \nActually, the issue is that it is VAGUE. It provides NO boundaries or limits, by itself.\n It doesn't say \"this applies to race but not to gays\". There is no verbage there that can establish why one group should be covered, but another should not.\n \n And I reject the idea that this means \"the writers had no idea\".\n It means the writers were wise enough to allow OTHERS to recognize the concept of \"equal protection\" for what it is.\nOk, well there is no indication they want it to mean every group should be covered. In fact, there is indication it doesn't. Unless you can support that the writers \"purposely left it vague so all groups are covered\" with historical evidence from the time of adoption than I see no reason to assume it does mean this.\n \n \nAgain, the guys who decided that blacks were 3/5 of a person?\n I'm sorry, but I have more faith in the words of the constitution than I have for them.\nThey wrote the words!\n \n \nAnd I feel you just contradicted yourself.\n We just went from \"we need to stick to the literal meaning of the constitution as established by the founders\"...... to \"the people, who can utilize any factor they want to, even DISREGARDING the constitution, should decide\".\nNo I did not say that. I never argue for a literal meaning. I argue for a reasonable meaning based on the meaning at adoption (and the method used for the first 100years..although it was called 'being a judge' then). This is MUCH different. Furthermore, the people can disregard the constitution and vote for a law...they just can only do this when voting for an amendment to the constitution. \n \n \nQuite frankly, on this one you have your individual opinion which contradicts the majority you want to stick with.\n A majority voted in the marriage laws. Ergo, it is not left up to the hospital.\n \n Too many people have seen what can happen if it is left up to the hospital. Racial or sexual orientation prejudice can come into play, making life difficult for the couple involved just cause somebody is a bigot.\n \"The people\" have already decided this is part of a \"right\"...\nWe are talking about visitation right? I say leave it to the hospital. If they make unfair polices than a local government can do things to fix that or you could just refuse to use the hospital when possible forcing them to change.",

Same-sex marriage supporters in California are not pitting voters against judges or judges against voters; that's not the issue. The issue is what is in the California constitution and whether the California constitution protects the right of same-sex couples to marry legally. \n \n The Supreme Court of California interpreted the state constitution as it existed before Proposition 8 was passed. In the Court's interpretation, the state constitution at that time protected a right to marriage that included same-sex couples. Proposition 8 then changed the constitution. It did not overrule the Supreme Court; Proposition 8 changed the document that the Supreme Court was interpreting, which was the state constitution. I think, based on what I have read, that the California Supreme Court probably correctly interpreted the constitution when it came to whether Proposition 8 was an amendment or a revision of the constitution. Now the supporters of same-sex marriage in California are launching a campaign to change the state constitution again to once again protect the right to marriage between same-sex couples. \n \n I think you know all this; you are just being snide in your post for some reason and putting down those with whom you disagree.

   "Well I'd agree with this but I base rights in a variety of ways. For example you have rights that I feel are inherent. This isn't very helpful in terms of protection because our country has developed a system for how rights are protected...ie a democratic way.\n\n I have a problem such phraseology cause it's inherently inaccurate.\n The courts are established to protect rights when they are violated. Not legislation.\n Legislation helps define issues as protected rights, but it is not essential for recognizing protected rights.\n \n \n \nThe constitution, among other things, sets up a system for how rights are protected and who protects them. The constitution has a few listed directly while the vast majority are held to the state and people with direct language stating the federal government shouldn't intervene.\n\n And when something violates discrimination for an item on that list, where is the recourse?\n The \"democratic way\", via legislation?\n No.\n The recourse is via the courts.\n \n \n \nI'd like to clarify that I don't think it is a constitutional right such as free speech. the \"right of marriage\" is only protected in a few ways by the constitution. \n 1) the lack of the right in the constitution doesn't mean the federal government can assume control over that right and control it/regulate it (see 9th amendment).\n 2) The right is left up to the states and/or people (see 10th amendment)\n\n And the 10th amendment has been \"amended\" by the 14th amendment.\n The states have plenty of powers, but they don't have the power (by the 14th amendment) to unjustly discriminate against people's rights. Not after the 14th.\n \n \n \nThe whole idea behind the constitution was not to give power into a few number of hands but power to as many people as possible because you can easily manipulate a few people but you can't do it to millions. \n\n Considering this claim, I can't help but think that you don't really appreciate how the founding fathers treated the governmental process.\n Our government could have been a strict democracy.\n Instead, we are primarily a REPUBLIC. Our founding fathers made us a REPUBLIC because they feared the masses being swayed more easily than \"a few people\"...\n \n \n \nThey are supposed to be the weakest branch. Because of this their power is limited to taking what the law says and applying it to situations. This isn't irrelevant and it sometimes isn't easy. If you have 5 people dictate policy than you make congress irrelevant and frankly this is what the courts do when they decide meaning based upon nothing more than how they feel that day (an exaggeration but hopefully you get my point). \n\n I disagree that they were \"supposed to be\" the weakest branch.\n And furthermore, if you have a person who violates the first amendment freedom of speech, where does the case go?\n To the courts of course.\n \n The courts not only apply the law, they apply the CONSTITUTION as well.\n Otherwise, the constitution is essentially meaningless. WHO is going to apply the constitution if not the courts?\n I can't remember a while back there was a case that involved a Florida woman whose brain was a vegetable. Her family wanted to keep her alive, but her husband wanted to end it.\n CONGRESS passed an UNCONSTITUTIONAL law (in an attempt to keep her alive), and EXPLICITLY TALKED about the fact that it was unconstitutional as they were passing it. emoticon_frazzled\n The courts ruled that it was unconstitutional.\n \n By your approach, wouldn't congress's unconstitutional law simply be taken as gospel, and the violation be ignored? Who would apply the constitution then?\n \n \n \nIt doesn't fail everytime and this case would be very hard to claim otherwise. But it is a good example of how procedure is to be followed even when it might be the wrong thing to do. Doing something right one time doesn't mean you do it right everytime. \n\n The same could be said of the people.\n But it's even worse in that situation, cause the people DO NOT HAVE TO CARE about what the constitution says.\n \n \n \nI disagree that it is legitimate. The federalist papers talked about this in length. Having the courts decide policy is having a rule by a few. Presenting \"logic and reason\" is not going to have a good outcome because logic and reason are different for everyone. Nine lawyers are no better at determining what is moral or what should be a right than you or I. Thus you vote on issues like this.\n\n Considering the lawyers and judges have been trained in the law, I disagree.\n The legal system is much more rigorous than just 1 person in \"50% +1\" changing his mind.\n \n \n \nWhat happens when you get 5 judges on the supreme court that say gay marriage is not a right? If you claim they are the ones that decide rights than you pretty much have no recourse. You certainly can't say they are wrong because you would be claiming they are the ones that decide these things. \n\n I agree it's not perfect.\n Take Loving v Virginia for example. The 14th amendment was passed 100 years before the Loving couple won it in court.\n For those 100 years, the system failed to recognize the pieces of the system which would clearly establish interracial marriage laws as unconstitutional.\n \n While it may take time for the courts to recognize it, they WILL recognize it.\n At that time, society disapproved by a margin of 3 to 1.\n \n \n [quote=Steeeeve[This is what our constitution calls for. People could vote to ban the color blue if they wanted to. The courts are not there to decide if a law makes sense to them or not. That makes them the greatest power.[/quote]\n This isn't about whether the law \"makes sense\".\n Let's not try to stray too far from the actual system's workings.\n \n And the people can still vote to do all sorts of outrageous things.\n There are some areas that have voted in all sorts of crazy zoning laws.\n As long as they pass a legitimate state interest test, based on their subject matter (if that test is even relevant), the laws can exist.\n \n \n \nNo it doesn't. They only serve to protect the people from the government. So if congress bans posting on internet forums than the court comes along and says \"no, the people said you can't do that without an amendment\". \n\n So they ARE supposed to provide constitutional checks on legislation as well.\n That is ultimately what I am saying. So we agree on that at least.\n \n Then our real source of dispute is on the validity of the INDIVIDUAL constitutional checks then. We would agree \"freedom of speech\" should be covered, while we disagree on others like \"right to privacy\" or \"marriage rights\".\n \n So, I would think that if tomorrow the people made a law that said \"marriage is a right\", we would be in an entirely different situation in your eyes, correct?\n \n \n \nMy method preserves freedom and doesn't dictate it.\n\n No. It doesn't.\n Society has absolutely NO OBLIGATION to provide any consistency.\n Society could vote \"marriage is a right\" on one day.\n And a year later vote 50% +1 \"marriage is not a right\", and suddenly the whole situation changes?\n That isn't \"preserving\" anything.\n \n At least courts are bound to precedent.\n \n \n \nYou have the freedom to enter a bad contract and pay the consequences of it. If something isn't fair doesn't make it not \"free\".\n\n But my point is that if the situation is challenged in legislation, what is said to be \"fair\" can suddenly be changed in the law, with the bias that more people rent than who rent out.\n \n \n \nThe courts also do NOT remove bias. In fact, this is the strongest case for me. You only need 5 bias people in a court and having an approach that looks at \"empathy\" for example automatically adds bias.\n\n emoticon_frazzled\n But at least the courts have to provide their reasoning, they are required to adhere to the constitution, and there is recourse for removal if grievous misconduct actually occurs.\n \n \n \nAny approach that doesn't look at the actual meaning as adopted by the people of any provisions in the constitution is inherently adding bias to the system. \n\n And the \"adopted by the people\" can also inherently BE biased.\n I just don't see any perspective which doesn't realize the society as more fallible to prejudice and bias.\n \n \nLook at my example. If you have those facts a judge that only looks at the law and what it says has to go with an unfair option and rule the person continue the payments. If a judge looks at what the law should be and what is right and fair than \"fair\" and \"right\" is really something personal to each of us (not that it is relative). So you will take a bias approach based upon your own circumstances, beliefs, and experiences.\n\n Actually, you left out a step.\n The judge should also consider the constitutionality of the law, and see if the law itself violates the constitution.\n \n And as a conclusion, if the judge follows the biased will of the people, it's an automatic \"no-win\" situation. BOTH the judge and the people would behave in the \"not fair\" way.\n At least in my situation, the judge has the opportunity to REVIEW the law vs the constitution and see if there is any violation. If so, \"fairness\" prevails.\n But in \"the people\" scenario, that check is sacrificed.\n \n \n \nThey were developed in court cases...there is no historical evidence from the adoption of the amendment. \n\n Both Ohioprof and I have both pointed out that the actual amendment itself is vague, providing no frame-work.\n That was done for a reason.\n \n \n \nBut it doesn't matter. Compelling state interest has no basis in the equal protection clause. There are zero historical documents at the time of adoption or even directly after that you need to convince the courts of a \"compelling state interest\"...whatever that even means (as it is meaningless). In fact, it is hard to even know what that clause means as their isn't much to support a meaning. \n\n I bold-faced/underlined a key sentence there.\n That would be an obvious indicator the drafters meant it to be interpreted.\n \n \n \nInterpret doesn't mean make up meaning to. Meaning is already set.\n\n Meaning exists, even if it isn't explicitly written before-hand.\n Judges recognize truths in our society, like how we treat marriage as a right. Just because it isn't explicitly listed already doesn't deny the validity of that statement.\n It goes part and parcel of the 9th amendment.\n \n \n \nInterpret is merely an action, in this case, to apply facts to a law that already has meaning and see if there is a violation. If I \"interpret\" your quote to mean \"It's the COURTS' JOB to replace Congress and rule the world\" you'd probably say i misrepresent your words. This is because your words have meaning and no one gets to determine what is or isn't going on in your head. \n\n But people could see my words, take the general context, and recognize that is NOT my opinion. In fact, they could see I am against that.\n You take it to an extreme of making things up, when the truth is that they simply look at the whole picture.\n \n \n \nOk, well there is no indication they want it to mean every group should be covered. In fact, there is indication it doesn't. Unless you can support that the writers \"purposely left it vague so all groups are covered\" with historical evidence from the time of adoption than I see no reason to assume it does mean this.\n\n I did not say that.\n If you look at my arguments, you would clearly see that I do not see all groups as being protected.\n I will not justify an argument I never made.\n They wrote the words!\n \n \n \nNo I did not say that. I never argue for a literal meaning. I argue for a reasonable meaning based on the meaning at adoption (and the method used for the first 100years..although it was called 'being a judge' then). This is MUCH different. Furthermore, the people can disregard the constitution and vote for a law...they just can only do this when voting for an amendment to the constitution. \n\n And who enforces that last clause you just said?\n The courts?\n \n \n \nWe are talking about visitation right? I say leave it to the hospital.

Furthermore, I feel you have to admit this is a departure from what the constitution is and the powers bestowed.\n\n \n Well, as we all know, the constitution actually does not say that the Supreme Court has the power of judicial review. We all recall that Thomas Jefferson railed against judicial review, arguing that this gave the Supreme Court power over the other two branches. But most people did not object to judicial review and simply assumed that this would be a principal role of the Supreme Court: to review legislation and determine if it's constitutional. Was this what the framers intended? Probably, but it's not entirely clear. \n \n The Supreme Court does determine the meaning of the constitution, and different justices use different approaches to arrive at the meaning. This does not mean they just make up a meaning; they try to discern what the framers were thinking. They also try to apply the principles articulated in the constitution to issues that arise today that could not have arisen when the constitution was written. \n \n It would be great if there were a fixed meaning to the words of the constitution that the framers all agreed on and that judges could simply figure out. They do try to discern the plain meaning of the words. But the meaning of the words is not always plain. We are humans, and different people read and understand the same words differently. This was true of the framers as it is of people reading the words centuries later. The framers were not Gods who all agreed on the precise meaning of the words. In the case of the 14th amendment, you say that John Bingham's meaning, which he talked about, is not the meaning of the words, that the meaning of the words is what the adopters thought. But different men who voted for the 14th amendment understood the words differently. Indeed, the words were written in broad language in part to satisfy different men (specifically Republicans) in Congress who did not agree about precisely what the amendment should say or mean. It was written broadly in part so the Congress would pass the amendment and states would ratify it. The adopters of the amendement were human no less than we are. \n \n You suggest that if this is true, then the 14th amendment has no meaning. It does not have a specific fixed meaning by the consensus of the adopters, since different adopters understood the amendment's meaning differently. Over time the Supreme Court has determined its meaning. For example, John Bingham, the principal author of the 14th amendment, saw the privileges and immunities clause as the central provision in the 14th amendment, the clause that would forever guarantee that states would not deny rights to persons. But the Supreme Court ruled in the Slaugterhouse Cases that the clause protected few if any rights, thus effectively rendering the clause irrelevant. It remains so today. \n \n I suspect that your view may resemble that of Thomas Jefferson, that the Supreme Court was asserting too much power. I think Jefferson would have been appalled that the Supreme Court would end up determining the meaning of the 14th amendment, as he was appalled at the power asserted by the Supreme Court in his lifetime. \n \n I am fine with the Supreme Court determining the meaning of the constitution, with the Court using a variety of approaches to determine its meaning. I do not think there is a fixed meaning to the 14th amendment, because the framers and adopters disagreed with each other on its meaning. I do not think the Supreme Court should simply make up a meaning for the amendment. But I don't think they have. Even the principle of \"liberty of contract\" which the conservative Supreme Court asserted in Lochner was a substantive right protected by the 14th amendment due process clause, had a basis. It was not just an idea the justices pulled out of their butts. I don't agree with the Lochner ruling, and few people today do agree with it. But I don't think it was the Supreme Court just inventing the law either. \n \n I have, btw, enjoyed this discussion with you. I always learn from you.",

   "Well, as we all know, the constitution actually does not say that the Supreme Court has the power of judicial review. We all recall that Thomas Jefferson railed against judicial review, arguing that this gave the Supreme Court power over the other two branches. But most people did not object to judicial review and simply assumed that this would be a principal role of the Supreme Court: to review legislation and determine if it's constitutional. Was this what the framers intended? Probably, but it's not entirely clear. \nThat court case was basically a plagiarism of the federalist papers. It was an exact example of a power they did have. Jefferson argued against it merely because he didn't like it (he was an anti-fed) but it was the understood meaning.\n \n \nThe Supreme Court does determine the meaning of the constitution, and different justices use different approaches to arrive at the meaning. This does not mean they just make up a meaning;\nDoesn't mean they can't. Making up meaning is an acceptable method under your view. They are not determining what the framers are thinking because you already stated this doesn't really matter. You can't claim there is a meaning the framers had and at the same time say there is many meanings and then say it doesn't matter what meaning is given because they decide anyway. You make the purpose of writing an amendment meaningless as already described.\n \n \nIt would be great if there were a fixed meaning to the words of the constitution that the framers all agreed on and that judges could simply figure out. They do try to discern the plain meaning of the words. But the meaning of the words is not always plain.\nThere is even if not known. If unknown you still need to explain why a judge could merely decide meaning based upon other things not related to original meaning. \n \n \nWe are humans, and different people read and understand the same words differently. This was true of the framers as it is of people reading the words centuries later. The framers were not Gods who all agreed on the precise meaning of the words. In the case of the 14th amendment, you say that John Bingham's meaning, which he talked about, is not the meaning of the words, that the meaning of the words is what the adopters thought. But different men who voted for the 14th amendment understood the words differently. Indeed, the words were written in broad language in part to satisfy different men (specifically Republicans) in Congress who did not agree about precisely what the amendment should say or mean. It was written broadly in part so the Congress would pass the amendment and states would ratify it. The adopters of the amendement were human no less than we are. \n \n You suggest that if this is true, then the 14th amendment has no meaning. It does not have a specific fixed meaning by the consensus of the adopters, since different adopters understood the amendment's meaning differently. Over time the Supreme Court has determined its meaning. For example, John Bingham, the principal author of the 14th amendment, saw the privileges and immunities clause as the central provision in the 14th amendment, the clause that would forever guarantee that states would not deny rights to persons. But the Supreme Court ruled in the Slaugterhouse Cases that the clause protected few if any rights, thus effectively rendering the clause irrelevant. It remains so today. \nThere are a few points to make here. First off, I deny there is more than one meaning of the 14th amendment. This is largely irrelevant because if you have multiple meanings you cannot use the amendment and I will explain this again next.\n \n Let's go back to our \"blueberries are the best\" example. Lets assume you have more than one meaning of this by the people who adopted the phrase. So for simplicity lets say one side meant blueberries are the best fruit and the other said blueberries make the best pancakes. Now if a court case comes up involving this and the judge has to pick a meaning by what standard does he pick? It is illogical to assume since two meanings exist that the judge can make up a third or fourth so those options are out. The judge is left picking between the two. If the judge picks the pancake meaning than you might be rejecting the best fruit meaning and visa versa. By doing so you alienate the people that adopted the phrase. Furthermore, you had no standard to pick one over the other. A third option is you accept all the meanings so it means blueberries make the best pancakes and are the best fruit. You can claim this is a win win but you have one MAJOR flaw. What happens when the two meanings go head to head? For example, what if the people that said blueberries are the best fruit absolutely hated blueberry pancakes. Thus is the case with the supposed many meanings of the 14th. They are opposites and cannot be used at the same time. So you are left with just picking one based upon no real criteria. There is nothing that says a judge is supposed to do this or can. No history suggests this is the role of a judge and actually there is some evidence to the opposite. \n \n \nI suspect that your view may resemble that of Thomas Jefferson, that the Supreme Court was asserting too much power. I think Jefferson would have been appalled that the Supreme Court would end up determining the meaning of the 14th amendment, as he was appalled at the power asserted by the Supreme Court in his lifetime. \nI don't know if this is true or not but he lost the debate (and really wasn't that much a part of it) in terms of the constitution. \n \n \nI have, btw, enjoyed this discussion with you.

The court upheld this ruling and thus failed to see that rights were taken away because the majority overcame a minority in a vote, and thus their rights were lost.\n \n This is the issue now! Regardless of if you agree with same sex marriage or not you cannot ignore the fact that now any minorities rights if perceived a threat to the majority (or religious \"Moral\" majority) now can not only be threatened, but taken away. \n \n If this is the case then in a radical worst case scenario we could see amendments protecting minorities stricken from the law. One thing everyone must remember. The constitution made it clear of a separation of church and state.

Moreover, I think your faith in these fallible justices is misplaced given the history of how most civil rights have come to be protected in the United States, namely, through some sort of legislation.\n\n \n I do not see this as an issue of whether the courts protect rights better than the people. The courts simply interpret the law, and the laws are passed by the people, or by their elected representatives. That's true of the constitution certainly. The issue is whether people in a particular state or in the nation in a particular time may pass laws that conflict with the protections of rights guaranteed by the constitution, which is a product of the people. Since the constitution is a superior expression of the will of the people than is a particular state or federal law, the will of the people is upheld when the Supreme Court strikes down a state law. It is just not the immediate will of the people in that particular state. The Court does not make up the protection of rights; the rights are protected by the constitution, which was ratified by the people.\n \n Of course people will always disagree with Supreme Court rulings. That's going to happen no matter how they interpret the constitution. Just about everyone today disagrees with Chief Justice Taney's ruling in Dred Scott. But in his mind, Taney was supporting the rights of the people; he was supporting what he regarded as the property rights of slaveholders. And the Supreme Court in the Plessy case also saw itself upholding the rights of the people. In their thinking, they were upholding the right of the majority of people in the states to enact segregation laws if they chose to. We can say today that in our judgment, the Supreme Court erred in both cases. But in both cases, there were people on both sides of the issue, and the Court came down on the side of the \"rights\" of the people who were slaveholders in Dred Scott and the \"rights\" of the white majority in Plessy. And in the Civil Rights Cases, the Court interpreted the 14th amendment narrowly, as prohibiting only state abrogation of rights, not acts by individuals. In their thinking, they were protecting the rights of private individuals to discriminate as they chose. \n \n I think that the Supreme Court of California probably ruled correctly on the meaning of the state constitution both times that the Court ruled recently on same-sex marriage. First they ruled that the previous state constitution protected the right of same-sex marriage. Then, after the constitution was amended, they ruled that this was an amendment, not a revision, of the state constitution, and they upheld the amendment. This was not the court protecting rights. It was the court interpreting the state constitution on the protection of rights.\n \n Now whether the amended California constitution conflicts with the U.S. constitution is a different question, and one that we may see answered.",

   "Actually, I do not believe this is at issue. I do not believe anyone has disputed that the power of judicial review is a legitimate power invested in the judicial branch. Instead, what I think is at issue is whether the courts, in seeking to apply the Constitution to cases, are restricted to applying the meaning that existed when the various provisions were adopted, or whether the courts may legitimately apply contemporary notions of what the Constitution means (bringing it up to date, as it were), regardless of whether it had such meaning when its various provisions were adopted.\n\n \n Hi, Phyllis. I read what sounded like an argument between you and Foundit over whether the people or the courts best protect people's rights. My point was that in all cases, protections for rights come from the people, whether through the constitution or through federal or state legislation. The Supreme Court is just the interpreter of the constitution; it does not in itself protect rights. The constitution does that, or federal or state law. \n \n The question you raise here is how the courts may legitimately interpret the constitution. I think there is no real dispute over provisions of the constitution that are clear; pretty much everyone agrees that they mean what the framers clearly intended them to mean when they wrote them. Disagreement arises over provisions of the constitution that are ambiguous. This is where constitutional scholars and jurists of good will and good conscience legitimately disagree over how to interpret the constitution. There are different theories of interpretation. The various theories are legitimate, and no one theory of judicial interpretation has become the determinative theory. The constitution itself is silent on how it should be interpreted; the constitution presents no theory or approach to its interpretation. \n \n I do not think the justices should simply assert their own personal values or beliefs in their rulings. Rulings have to be based on the constitution itself. But I don't know of anyone who argues that the justices should simply make their beliefs the law. This seems to be a straw man used to beat up the Supreme Court. And both conservatives and liberals over time have beaten up the Supreme Court, insisting that the judges are just inventing a meaning for the constitution and asserting their own beliefs as the law of the land. Of course, judges are human, and so their personal biases and beliefs are going to enter into their rulings, usually unintentionally. I give most Supreme Court justices credit for trying faithfully to interpret the constitution, even when I disagree with their interpretations. \n \n Given that, I think it is clear that the Supreme Court's interpretations of the constitution have evolved and changed over time, not because of something illegitimate, but because of how the Courts have tried to decide on the meaning of constitutional provisions that are ambiguous. It sounds paradoxical to say that the Court's interpretations have evolved in large part because of the principle of stare decisis, or settled law, but I think this is true. Previous Courts have decided on what ambiguous clauses of the constitution mean, and subsequent Courts have built on the meanings decided by the previous Courts to resolve new constitutional issues. Each time the Supreme Court rules on what a provision of the constitution means, it effectively fills in a gap or resolves an ambiguity in the meaning of the constitution. Subsequent Courts rely on these resolutions of ambiguity to resolve subsequent cases, sometimes ruling further on what the constitution means. In this way, the Supreme Court's interpretation of the constitution evolves, as the Court over time seeks to address ambiguity in the meaning of the document itself. The Court does look to modern understandings in its reliance on precedent and in its respect for the principle of stare decisis. These are modern legal understandings, the body of interpretations that stand as precedent. The Court does look to the plain meaning of the text, but if the meaning of the text is not plain, the Court looks to precedent,to rulings over time that have determined the meaning of a text that is ambiguous. Sometimes, of course, a Court determines that a previous ruling was in error and strikes it down. But that happens infrequently.",

   "What would you call it where the Supreme Court strikes down a law that does not violate the Constitution. In your view, is such a thing even possible?\n\n \n No, the Supreme Court can only, according to precedent, strike down laws that violate the constitution. The Supreme Court can and does strike down state laws that conflict with federal laws, but this is based on the constitution's supremacy clause. So in those cases, the Court is ruling that the state law in question, by conflicting with a federal law, violates the constitution. \n \n I believe the Marshall Court back in the early decades of the 19th century ruled that the Supreme Court cannot strike down federal laws unless they violate the constitution. I will try to find the case.",

   "It strikes me that when we get into discussions in these gay rights forums about constitutional interpretation and the issue of gay rights, I often do a descriptive/explanatory analysis of how the Supreme Court has ruled in the past and how it may rule in the future, and Steeeve tends to get into a normative discussion, of how he thinks the Supreme Court should rule based on his theory of constitutional interpretation. That's why we sometimes talk past each other. I usually focus on how the Supreme Court may rule, and whether I think that this is a good time tactically to bring a case before the Supreme Court to try to get either the state or federal DOMA laws struck down as unconstitutional. Steeeve tends to focus on whether the 14th amendment should be interpreted to strike down such laws, on whether the 14th amendment has been interpreted in the past in ways that he views as proper or correct. \n \n I often talk about what is, and Steeve often talks about what he thinks should be. I personally am not upset with the general direction taken by the Supreme Court in its interpretations; I do not see a fundamental problem with the U.S. Supreme Court. I disagree with specific rulings, such as the ruling in Bush v. Gore, but I do not think the Supreme Court has overstepped its constitutional authority, nor do I see the Supreme Court as making up law or trampling on the will of the people. I see the Supreme Court as doing its job of interpreting the constitution, of telling us what the law is. This is why I don't usually get tangled up in arguing about what the Supreme Court should be doing, since I think the Court is doing what it should be doing. Again, I disagree with specific rulings, but my disagreement does not mean that these rulings are illegitimate. They are just different ways of interpreting the constitution than I would favor. \n \n When it comes to the 14th amendment (here I am jumping into the normative discussion), I think there is rich source material from the framers to see an intention to provide broad protections for rights. Bingham argued for protecting all rights of all persons. Others who voted for the amendment in Congress or in state legislatures probably regarded the rights protected more narrowly than Bingham and Thaddeus Stevens did. These differences of understanding and interpretation among the framers and adopters of the amendment open the door to the question that continues to swirl: which rights does the amendment protect? There is a strong basis for arguing that the framers of the amendment who worked on it in committee, and many of the Republicans in Congress who adopted the amendment, viewed the amendment as providing broad protections for the rights of all persons from state abrogation. At the very least, there is strong evidence that both Bingham and Stevens and probably the committee that crafted the amendment did intend the amendment to incorporate the Bill of Rights and apply it to the states. Bingham argued at various points that the amendment protected an even wider variety of rights than those specifically enumerated in the Bill of Rights. He apparently saw the rights protected by the 5th amendment as a broad array of rights, falling under \"liberty,\" and he intended with the 14th amendment to protect that broad array of rights from state abrogation.",

The first step in interpretation is to look at the plain meaning of the text of the constitution, whatever the case and the provision in question.

   "I use the theory adopted by the majority of justices for the first 100 or so of the constitution which is the same as bork, scalia, and thomas now (as examples). This doesn't involve intent because intent is impossible to find.\n\n \n The interpretive approach known as textualism has a history going back before even John Marshall, it's true. Marshall himself has been called a textualist. But textualism as a theory and an approach has evolved. Justice Scalia and the liberal scholar Akhil Amar have written the most developed and clear explanations of modern textualist interpretive theory. Modern textualism is a reaction against the non-originalist interpretive approaches that began to prevail in the late 20th century. Modern textualists argue against the version of originalism that looks for the original intent of the framers; modern textualism looks to the plain meaning of the text and to how ordinary people reading a text interpret it. \n \n Modern textualism is also a reaction against the modern Supreme Court's practice of engaging in balancing rather than in simply interpreting the meaning of words. Supreme Courts in the late 20th century in particular began to apply balancing tests to determine the limits of rights versus government power, especially state power under the 14th amendment. \n \n I understand that you embrace Scalia's approach to constitutional interpretation, the modern textualist approach. (Scalia has called himself a textualist.) Scalia, of all the modern Supreme Court justices, has probably the most philosophically consistent theory of constitutional interpretation. \n \n But there are limits to textualism, and we run into those limits when we encounter ambiguous provisions in the constitution. I ask again how you would arrive at the agreed upon, common, plain meaning of the text when there were disagreements among the people at the time of ratification about the meaning of the text? When the meaning of the text is not plain, what does a textualist do? Usually he or she resorts to ever-closer scrutiny of the text. If finding the original intent of the framers is difficult, finding a commonly agreed-upon plain meaning of ambiguous provisions of the constitution is even more difficult. It's probably impossible to arrive at a broad consensus that could be called the meaning of the text according to textualist theory. \n \n Another problem with modern textualist theory is that nothing in the constitution says that this is the proper approach to interpreting the constitution. Justice Scalia says it is, but that's his viewpoint. There is nothing in the text itself that calls for textualism. Why not look to the original intent of the framers, rather than the plain meaning as the Court believes it was understood by the people? You say that original intent is impossible to determine, but this is not necessarily true. And the understanding of the meaning of the text by the people at the time of ratification is no less hard to discern. And as I suggested earlier, the people may not hold a common understanding of the meaning of the text. The text may be ambiguous. \n \n There are strengths to textualist theory. One is that this approach focuses on the constitution itself, the text, and shifts the focus away from precedent. Some scholars have argued that the respect for precedent went too far in constitutional history, so that modern justices have largely ignored the constitution itself and have simply cited precedents in their rulings. Another strength of textualism is that it does have a long history. And it does seek to prevent judges from imposing their own personal beliefs on the law, by putting the focus on the text of the constitution. \n \n I would like to suggest to you that the 14th amendment in significant respects changed the constitution. The 14th amendment was the source of the constitution's new protections for individual rights. It was the 14th amendment that led to the Supreme Court engaging in balancing individual rights versus state power and state interests. The 14th amendment called for protections for the rights of individuals against the collective rights of citizens to enact laws in their states. And the meaning of the 14th amendment was not and is not plain. It poses an interpretive problem for textualists. Scalia recognizes that there is a tension between the rights of the majority to pass laws in their states and the rights of individuals to be protected from the majority. What does the 14th amendment say are the limits of individual rights versus state power? It doesn't. There is nothing in the text about this. Scalia's approach in such circumstances is to turn to tradition. He has said that the Court should look to traditional views of what rights are to be protected from state abrogation. But nothing in the constitution says that the Supreme Court should look to popular tradition to decide on the meaning of a provision of the constitution. Scalia himself thus departs from textualism in his approach when the constitution is ambiguous, effectively making up a way of arriving at the meaning of a provision of the constitution. It is no less made up than the practice of applying balancing tests.",

   "I need to spend more time sleeping and less time thinking about constitutional interpretation. In the middle of the night, after writing my last post, I picked up my Ely book (Democracy and Distrust) and read it over again. Ely, I think, was brilliant. He directly addresses in his book the problem I was writing about earlier: how the Supreme Court should interpret provisions of the constitution whose meaning is not clear from the text or whose specific meaning was left open-ended by the framers for future determination.

   "I need to spend more time sleeping and less time thinking about constitutional interpretation. In the middle of the night, after writing my last post, I picked up my Ely book (Democracy and Distrust) and read it over again. Ely, I think, was brilliant. He directly addresses in his book the problem I was writing about earlier: how the Supreme Court should interpret provisions of the constitution whose meaning is not clear from the text or whose specific meaning was left open-ended by the framers for future determination. Ely points out examples of provisions that are obviously clear, provisions that are easily clarified, and provisions whose meaning is open to various interpretations.

   "Scalia, of all the modern Supreme Court justices, has probably the most philosophically consistent theory of constitutional interpretation.\n\n Except for Justice Thomas ;).\n \n \nThe 14th amendment called for protections for the rights of individuals against the collective rights of citizens to enact laws in their states. And the meaning of the 14th amendment was not and is not plain. It poses an interpretive problem for textualists. Scalia recognizes that there is a tension between the rights of the majority to pass laws in their states and the rights of individuals to be protected from the majority. What does the 14th amendment say are the limits of individual rights versus state power? It doesn't. There is nothing in the text about this. Scalia's approach in such circumstances is to turn to tradition. He has said that the Court should look to traditional views of what rights are to be protected from state abrogation.\n\n I'm not sure this is an entirely correct reading of Scalia. In the first place, Scalia rejects substantive due process. What he usually does, mostly in dissent, is to argue in the following way (my paraphrase):\n \n 1. Substantive due process is not a legitimate basis for constitutional interpretation.\n \n 2. Assuming it was, the Court should be limited to protecting only those rights that are \"so deeply rooted in the Nation's history and tradition as to be ranked as fundamental.\" This is not a baseless argument, by the way. Scalia typically references where substantive due process first got recognition in the Court, and from that time until fairly recently, that the limitation the Court had always placed on which substantive rights are protected by the 14th Amendment's Due Process clause. In modern times, however, the Supreme Court has moved away from this formulation of the limitation on substantive due process. And Scalia is quick to point that out to a Court that always presents itself as following precedent.\n \n Thus, Scalia does not depart from his originalist approach. He just has a dual argument against the way the modern Court is applying substantive due process because, not only (in Scalia's view) is that doctrine illegitimate, but the current Court's application of the doctrine substantially departs from the Courts own precedents.",

   "The interpretive approach known as textualism has a history going back before even John Marshall, it's true. Marshall himself has been called a textualist. \n Textualist and originalist is one in the same and it wasn't called anything back in Marshalls time..it was called being a judge. \n \n \nModern textualists argue against the version of originalism that looks for the original intent of the framers; modern textualism looks to the plain meaning of the text and to how ordinary people reading a text interpret it. \nIntent was never really a theory of textualists...at least not how you and I think of \"intent\". \n \n \nBut there are limits to textualism, and we run into those limits when we encounter ambiguous provisions in the constitution. I ask again how you would arrive at the agreed upon, common, plain meaning of the text when there were disagreements among the people at the time of ratification about the meaning of the text? When the meaning of the text is not plain, what does a textualist do? \nI have answered this numerous times. You can't rule on something you don't know the meaning of. It is illogical. Bork was correct when talking about the ink blot. This \"problem\" has only one alternative and that is to make up the meaning. This is by far a worse approach.\n \n \nAnother problem with modern textualist theory is that nothing in the constitution says that this is the proper approach to interpreting the constitution.\nThis is because there was not other approach at the time. There is no need to define every word in the constitution if people are honest about how sentences and words come together to make laws. The constitution is a law just like every other law (only the supreme law) and it should be treated like that.",

The constitution is a law just like every other law (only the supreme law) and it should be treated like that.\n\n \n Textualism is one variety of originalism, and original intent is another variety of originalism. They are different approaches within a similar tradition. At least that is how I look at different schools of constitutional interpretation. \n \n My disagreement with you is over whether the constitution has a fixed meaning that can be determined with certainty using any approach. There are provisions of the constitution, of course, that are clear and specific. Much of the constitution is clear and specific. The problematic parts of the constitution, though, are some of the most important parts, because they deal with individual rights and the powers of the Congress and the states. \n \n The 14th amendment is one of the most problematic sections of the constitution, as its meaning is not clear from the language, and discerning how the ratifiers thought of the amendment is largely impossible, because we do not have much evidence from the ratifying conventions. We actually have more evidence of the original intent of the framers of the amendment, which would aid in the approach of the other branch of originalism: the original intent branch. But there really does not appear to have been a broad consensus of opinion as to specifically what the 14th amendment meant, and discerning meaning from the text is similarly impossible, because of the broad language in which the amendment was written. \n \n In contrast, the commonly understood meaning of the 15th amendment is clear, even in the breach, because the 15th amendment was written in specific language and people generally agreed upon what it meant. In order to circumvent the 15th amendment's prohibition against denying the right to vote on the basis of race, color, or previous condition of servitude, the southern states devised means of blocking African Americans from voting that did not mention race in the law, and they were able to get around the meaning of the 15th amendment this way. That they did this shows that the recognized the purpose of the amendment and that they devised ways to get around it.\n \n Using evidence from the framers of the 14th amendment, notably John Bingham and others on the committee, it seems clear to me that they intentionally wrote the amendment in broad language, to apply not only to the newly freed slaves, but to any persons who might in the future be denied privileges and immunities, or due process, or equal protection of the laws by the states. Contrast the wording of the 14th amendment with the wording of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which did refer to \"all persons,\" but which was more specific in naming the persons in question and in naming the specific rights that the law protected. The 14th amendment makes no mention of race or color or previous condition of servitude. It was written broadly on purpose, as statements of the framers demonstrate. I know this is the interpretive approach you dislike, that of looking to original intent. But when it comes to the 14th amendment, the statements of the framers are instructive, and we have more evidence of what they intended than we do of how the ratifiers viewed the meaning of the amendment.\n \n By wording the 14th amendment broadly, the framers of the amendment left it to people in the future to address forms of state discrimination that might emerge in the future. This is what I think Ely means when he says that there are provisions of the constitution that the framers left open-ended. \n \n That some provisions of the constitution lack a single fixed meaning that we can determine with certainty from the text or from the historical evidence does not mean that these provisions are meaningless. I think Ely is right that the framers gave us broad principles to guide our understanding of the constitution, principles that we can apply to determining the meaning of broadly and/or ambiguously worded sections of the constitution like the 14th amendment.",

But there really does not appear to have been a broad consensus of opinion as to specifically what the 14th amendment meant, and discerning meaning from the text is similarly impossible, because of the broad language in which the amendment was written. \nLook, I don't argue that some provisions have meaning that is unclear at times...the 9th was famous for this until recently. The 14th amendment due process clause doesn't seem to unclear at all but you might consider the equal protection clause to be that. In any event, I reject any idea that not knowing meaning allows you to make up meaning. It is 100% illogical and you need to state why this isn't true. If I write a law that says \"I think I want to _______ you\" than can you determine what I meant to put in that blank spot? Can you reasonably tell I wanted you to fill it in? What if I meant for it to say \"hug\" but you thought it was \"kill\". I mean it is illogical to assume power where you were given none. The writers of the constitution were very concerned about the government assuming power just because it didn't say they couldn't do it. This was the argument against the bill of rights and creation of 9th and 10th amendments.\n \n \nUsing evidence from the framers of the 14th amendment, notably John Bingham and others on the committee, it seems clear to me that they intentionally wrote the amendment in broad language, to apply not only to the newly freed slaves, but to any persons who might in the future be denied privileges and immunities, or due process, or equal protection of the laws by the states. \nThan please give me something that shows Bingham wanted the courts to determine how this would or would not apply. For example the compelling state interest test and substantive due process are both used for determining whether a law is invalid or not. How are these related to the intent and where did Bingham suggest he wanted the COURTS to do this kind of thing? \n \n \nNot to be churlish, but as fascinating as this trialogue is, the last dozen or so posts seem to be only indirectly connected to the topic of Gay Rights, if at all.\n \n Would you all mind taking this discussion to a more appropriate board?\nYou would need to ask the admin to separate the thread or indicate we need to get back on topic.
