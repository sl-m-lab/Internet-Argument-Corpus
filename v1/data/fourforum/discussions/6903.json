   "November 27 is going to be a day of determination in Russia. If you have no interest of this you may skip it and forget.\n \n An anti-fascist march of all Russian people is going to take place in Russian capital this day. The only problem is that the leading participants of the march are of no credit. Actually, among the organizers of the march stand chief Russian oppositional political parties - SPS (Union of the Rights) which in fact stands for interests of oligarchs that in fact robbed the country and the \"Yabloko\" (rus. Apple) whose leader Yavlinski has finally discredited himself as a politician and a man of good morals after his decision to consolidate with SPS.\n \n Speaking of the \"Yabloko\", this party has lost absolutely all political influence lately and now is so willing to right itself that even descented to founding a single block with the KPRF (the Communist Party of Russian Federation) on the platform of anti-Putinism.\n \n Though, doing so, Mr Yavlinski no doubt pursues his own ends - he is trying to stay at the head of the \"Yabloko\" party as he relies on the support of Mr Zyuganov - the KPRF chairman. Surely, SPS party is not fond of this a KPRF-Yabloko alliance which makes me think all sorts of provocations are awaited this day. \n So if you are living in Moscow stay inside on this day.",
