   "The Daily Tribune. Z Wire. May 10, 2001\n \n Bruce Bauer, M.D. and Richard J. Lomas, D.D.S., Guest Columnists May 10, 2001\n \n Given the scientifically documented hazards of homosexuality, should a truly enlightened, compassionate society encourage such behavior? These men say our laws should discourage, not enable such behavior.\n \n \n \n Royal Oak voters will decide May 15 whether to adopt an ordinance granting special class status to persons involved in homosexual behavior. Proposal 2, if adopted, will legitimize homosexuality as deserving of special protection. Given the scientifically documented hazards of homosexuality, should a truly enlightened, compassionate society encourage and enable such behavior?\n \n For individuals involved in homosexuality, the likelihood of being attacked by their own homosexual lovers is a staggering 50,000 percent greater than the risk of so-called \"hate crimes\".\n \n \"We believe as many as 650,000 gay men may be victims of domestic violence each year in the U.S.\" wrote David Island and Patrick Letellier, co-editors of the National Gay & Lesbian Domestic Network Newsletter. \"The probability of violence occuring in a gay couple is mathematically double the probablity of that in a heterosexual couple.\"\n \n \"Lesbians reported as much abuse as gay men did,\" The New York Times wrote last November, citing a national study.\n \n Homosexual domestic violence among men alone dwarfs 500 to one the 1,317 hate crimes nationwide last year allegedly motivated, by disapproval of homosexuality, the FBI reported.\n \n Between the Lines, Detroit's homosexual newsmagazine, reported the risk of anal cancer soars by nearly 4,000 percent among men involved in homosexuality.\n \n The Medical Institute of Sexual Health reports \"homosexual men are at significantly increased risk of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, anal cancer, gonorrhea, and gastrointestinal infections as a result of their sexual practices.\" While \"women who have sex with women are at significantly higher risk of bacterial, breast cancer and ovarian cancer than are heterosexual women.\"\n \n The Center for Disease Control reports men involved in homosexuality are 860 percent more likely to contract sexually transmitted disease, partially because they \"have large numbers of anonymous partners, which can result in rapid, extensive transmission of STD's...threatening national HIV infection prevention efforts.\"\n \n \"Gay men of all ages remain at an alarming risk,\" the CDC warns while \"Young bisexual men are a 'bridge' to women, threatening not only their own lives but the general population.\n \n Oxford University's International Journal of Epidemiology reports \"life expectancy at age 20 for gay and bisexual men is eight to 20 years less than for all men. If the same pattern of mortality continues, we estimate that nearly half of gay and bisexual men currently aged 20 will not reach their 65th birthday.\"\n \n Judging the years of life put as risk, homosexual behavior is up to three times deadlier than smoking, society nonetheless condemns, restricts and spends millions of tax dollars to discourage the lesser threat(tobacco), while irrationally contemplating Proposal 2-type laws to protect and force social acceptance of the greater(homosexuality).\n \n Our laws should discourage, not enable such deadly behavior. On May 15, please vote no on Proposal 2.\n \n Dr. Bauer practiced medicine in Berkley and was on staff at Beaumont Hospital until his retirement. Dr. Lomas is a 36 year resident of Royal Oak and is a retired dentist.\n \n http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=1799096&BRD=989&PAG=461&dept_id=140318&rfi=6",

   "The International Journal of Epidimiology study on life expectancy looked at HIV infected people in a select urban area from 1987-1992.\n \n Much has changed since then, and the authors of the study admit that much has changed..\n \n In contrast, if we were to repeat this analysis today the life expectancy of gay and bisexual men would be greatly improved. Deaths from HIV infection have declined dramatically in this population since 1996. As we have previously reported there has been a threefold decrease in mortality in Vancouver as well as in other parts of British Columbia.\n http://ije.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/6/1499",

   "\n An overwhelming majority of domestic violence victims in heterosexual relationships are women. \n \n \n 90 - 95% of domestic violence victims are women. \n Bureau of Justice Statistics Selected Findings: Violence Between Intimates (NCJ-149259), November 1994. \n \n \n as many as 95% of domestic violence perpetrators are male. \n A Report of the Violence against Women Research Strategic Planning Workshop sponsored by the National Institute of Justice in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1995. \n \n \n much of female violence is committed in self-defense, and inflicts less injury than male violence. \n Chalk & King, eds., Violence in Families: Assessing Prevention & Treatment Programs, National Resource Council and Institute of Medicine, p. 42 (1998). \n \n \n during 1992-1993, women were 6 times more likely to experience violence by an intimate partner than men.\n Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report: Violence Against Women: Estimates from the Redesigned Survey (NCJ-154348), August 1995, p. 1. \n \n \n the chance of being victimized by an intimate is 10 times greater for a woman than a man.\n Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report: National Crime Victimization Survey, Violence Against Women, 1994. \n \n \n 70% of intimate homicide victims are female.\n Bureau of Justice Statistics Selected Findings: Violence Between Intimates (NCJ-149259), November 1994. \n \n \n male perpetrators are 4 times more likely to use lethal violence than females.\n Florida Governor's Task Force on Domestic and Sexual Violence, Florida Mortality Review Project, 1997, p.44, table 7. \n\n \n http://www.dccadv.org/statistics.htm\n \n Thanks JakeCJB for the link to Letellier's rebuttal of the AFA's \"gross misinterpretation\" of his book-\n \n \nHad he wanted to present accurate information, Glenn could have cited studies demonstrating that lesbians and gay men batter their partners at approximately the same rate as heterosexual men. That means about one couple in four, regardless of gender or sexual orientation, will be rocked by domestic violence. \n\n \n \n Perhaps we should recommend that people avoid becoming intimate with anyone, as this so often leads to violence. Or perhaps there are other solutions....\n \n \n\n Differences in the health of blacks and whites are many and varied. Blacks have more undetected diseases, higher disease and illness rates (from infectious conditions such as tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases), more chronic conditions (such as hypertension and diabetes), and shorter life expectancies than whites (78,79,80,81). Morbidity and mortality rates for blacks from many conditions (cancer, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, and homicide) exceed those for whites (80,82). These findings exist even though black females are generally less likely than white females to report risk behaviors such as smoking cigarettes, consuming alcohol, or using other substances (79,83,84,85). \n \n Hispanic and white women have a higher lifetime prevalence of depression (24 percent and 22 percent, respectively) than black women (16 percent). Furthermore, when surveyed in 1991, nearly twice as large a share of Hispanic women (11 percent) reported being depressed as did black and white women (nearly 6 percent and 5 percent, respectively) (80). \n \n A 1993 survey found Hispanic women (53 percent) more likely to suffer from severe depression than either non-Hispanic black (47 percent) or white (37 percent) women (13). \n\n \n http://www.4woman.gov/owh/pub/woc/toc.htm\n \n Apparently many things can cause disease and depression prevalence. \n \n Your article (an opinion piece) is so transparently homophobic. The quoted \"Medical Institute of Sexual Health\", BTW, is a right-wing foundation mainly centred around abstinence-only and no-premarital-sex sex education. Sure, their name sounds all professional, but that just goes to show that a name means nothing.\n \n \nFor individuals involved in homosexuality, the likelihood of being attacked by their own homosexual lovers is a staggering 50,000 percent greater than the risk than the risk of so-called \"hate crimes.\"\n\n \n What, no source? \n \n Nice try. Next you're gonna recommend aborting black women fetuses to prevent the associated health risks. emoticon_rolleyes",
