   "emoreno2292:\n \n I take your thread seiously and am responding that way.\n \n Your questions come burdened with some basic preconceptions or prejudices. Your second question (Was Jesus' death really a sacrifice if he was god anyway and went back to heaven?) is easily answered in that he wasn't God and he never claimed to be. You could ask the same question about anyone. Was JFK's death really a sacrifice if he was god anyway and went back to heaven? Or, was Uday Hussein's death really a sacrifice if he was god anyway and went back to heaven? Underlying your question is the assumption that God died. My preconceptions and prejudices surface here because I assume you are talking about a monotheistic concept of God. If so, you can be an atheist and believe that there is no God, in which case he couldn't have died because he never existed, or an agnostic and not care, or a theist and believe in an all-knowing and all-powerful eternal God who couldn't die and therefore did not die, but what is it if you believe there was a God and now he's dead? A human being can sacrifice his or her life for something - like sacrificing your life to save your child, but the monotheistic concept of God assumes an entity outside the realm of life and death.\n \n As to your first question (If god is omniscient then how do we have free will?), the question assumes a personification of God. You cannot address the questions without first addressing the concept of God. Notice how the entire thread gets sidetracked in semantics and bogged down in minutia. There is an old saying: \"God made man in his own image and likeness and man returned the favor.\" \n \n To reduce God to a concept that we can comprehend in our limited intellects is the silliest of pursuits. All these concepts, \"omniscient God\", \"triune God\", \"messianic God\", are man's desperate attempts to define the indefinable. We cannot understand the mind of God and therefore the very concept of an \"omniscient God\" becomes one of the many typical human concepts and devices meant to shield us from the terror many of us have of the unknown and unknowable.\n \n Imagine God sitting back and watching as one group of humans burns incense and voices Gregorian Chants in Gold encrusted cathedrals and another bows down five times a day when a horn sounds and walks around in circles on certain days of the year and still another dresses is special clothes and grows their hair a certain way and only eat certain foods - and all the time all of them thinking that it is going to put them on God's good list - as if God were Santa Clause with his \"good boys and girls list\" and his \"bad boys and girls list\". It seems to me God has his own cable TV and it all comedy! \n \n So, as far as the omniscient God, we are human beings, we need sustenance, we are provided with sustenance - food, water, etc. -- seems at minimum prescient. We need a way to access that sustenance, so we have mouths and digestive systems. That seems pretty omniscient to me. On top of that we get friends, family, pleasure, and a myriad of other wonders to play with. That seems more than omniscient to me - that seems loving and caring.\n \n So all these questions about \"omniscient God\" and \"Jesus' sacrifice\" and all these other theological conundrums which are man-made constructs are really distractions from the \"life more abundant\" that has been given to us. \n \n Finally, since your queries seem to come from a Christian background, I encourage to simply read the words of Jesus in the Gospels - forget what the others say, read what Jesus said, not what others said he did, only what he said, what he taught -- and once you have a firm foundation in his words and teachings, a lot of this other stuff becomes ridiculously clear. \n \n All the best.",

Hmmm, the Roman Catholic Church is governed by men and men who find the sexual organs of women to be unsavoury generally prefer certain things sexually.\n\n When you asked how was it possible for Jesus to be born without sin, I think the immaculate conception theory answers. Mary herself was conceived without sin - full of grace, and preserved by God from the corruption inherent in human nature. \n \n This doctrine was contrived to explain how the conception of Jesus Christ was untainted by original sin.
