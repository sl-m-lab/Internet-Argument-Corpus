   "Yeah, that'd be great, wouldn't it? And actually Matt, you do, in the sense that anything you vote for that succeeds impacts SOMEONE. Does the teachers union come and burn your books when you vote against a school bond issue?\n The reality of the situation is this: Your group is a minority, there are LESS of you in the pool of voters. To succeed in achieving the rights you so desperately want, you need the help of people like me (white, middle-aged, middle-class, poster-child-for-average) to believe in your cause and act to advance it. That's been the determining factor in every civil rights issue in this country. I actually believe that soon we will be in the majority on the marriage issue, as we have come to be in all other areas of gay rights. As angry as you are, vengeful tactics win you no friends in the group where you need them most.\n\n \n \n Yes I know but it keeps the forum from getting boring ;) \n BTW I miss the TCC and its fantastic smilies :(",

   "So let me get this straight Chester, if my religeous beliefs say an action is wrong, be it murder or homosexuality, etc, and I say I cant support that action, im descriminating against the folks commiting those actions. So because murder is wrong and I dont support it, im now descriminating against murderers, or because I believe rape is wrong and do not support it either, im descriminating against rapists. You say that all this is christian based desceimination and has no place in America, and that I need to rethink what I had said in my earlier post, but I think you need to rethink about your reply to that post, because to me it sounds like you want to throw all morals out the door and have an anything goes free for all. If you dont like to hear how christians feel about things, you should not discuss those issues in public where christian opinions can be added, and further more, when you said my statements were faith based descrimination and it had no place in America, you basically said christians have no place in America, so now who is descriminating against who. Simply stating that I believe murder, rape, or homosexuality is wrong is not descrimination, it is simply a statement of my beliefs, and never once did I even hint at passing judgement against gay people, I mearly stated that I believed their actions were wrong and that I could not support those actions by supporting laws that support those actions. Did you know that christian beliefs are descriminated against more than anything else in the world, the Bible calls it persicution.",

Did you know that christian beliefs are descriminated against more than anything else in the world, the Bible calls it persicution.\nTo liken homosexuality to rape and murder is disingenuous. Rape and murder deprive other human beings of the rights we both would protect whether from your religious or my secular standpoint. Living your life as a homosexual harms no one directly. \n \n Ironic that you don't feel the need to exercise your religious prerogative when it comes to multiple wives and the keeping of slaves as your religion has traditionally advocated. \n \n Simply put, you don't own this society. Where your religion and my philosophy agree we have no discord. Where yours seeks to limit my freedom without rational support beyond your dogma, you lose.",

But that's not the case now, is it? You can come up with a bunch of reasons why murder and rape are wrong that don't reference the Bible, right? But you yourself say that you think gay marriage is wrong just because of your Bible. You want your religious beliefs to have a negative effect other people's lives, and that's not right. Imagine if someone told you that you couldn't eat hotdogs any more, just because their religion said you shouldn't. Would you think that was right or just or even a little bit acceptable? Of course not. Let your religion effect your own life as much as you like, but when it comes to decisions that effect other people you have to be able to put your wholely personal beliefs aside and decide what to do based on some other criteria.",

To them, what's more detrimental to our nation?
