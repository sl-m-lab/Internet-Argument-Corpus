   "and wailing and gnashing of teeth over the flow of firearms fom one place to another a problem has been spotted. With liberal shills screeching for more laws, more control the crux of the problem was inadvertly revealed. Perusing the usal leftist swill from Pravda er the state run media er the left-tard excuse for a 4th estate. The solution was exposed. Both startling and damning in its simplicity it should never be revealed lest the whole scam of more control, more laws come crashing down on their obviously empty heads.\n \n the problem and the solution revealed.\n \n In Pennsylvania and other states, police and prosecutors generally haven't made straw buyers a priority. Of course if they did then the flow would dry up and no more publicity could be milked from the pseudo problem.\n \n http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/paw/pr/2008_june/2008_06_09_01.html",

   "State Sen. Dominic Pileggi said stronger gun laws don't address the underlying problems of what causes gun violence.\n \n \"I think that all the discussion about stronger gun laws is a diversion form the real core problems,\" Pileggi said. \"Someone goes out and kills five people with a handgun that has the serial numbers scratched off and all of a sudden people say if we had stronger gun laws, this wouldn't have happened. Nobody believes that. We can talk about one gun a month or this and that kind of background check, but I have yet to see any evidence that would attack the problem of violence that we see in Philadelphia every day.\"",
