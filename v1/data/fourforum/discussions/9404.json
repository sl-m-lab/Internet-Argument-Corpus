   "Now it is an absolute fact that BBC Gaza correspondent Alan Johnston was kidnapped by Chechen militants. There are several evidences that count in favor of this assumption. First of all, Palestinian police said four gunmen were seen in the vicinity of where Johnston's abandoned car was found and some eyewitnesses insist that these four were speaking the Chechen language. Besides that, there is an evidence of an unnamed London barkeeper who advised the police about a phone conversation he overheard casually between a man who resembles the leader of Chechen militants Akhmed Zakaev living in London and an unknown person. According to the barkeeper, Zakaev was persuading the interlocutor into taking part in some touch-and-go business that might be rather gainful. He said, \"it would be easy to do 'cause he (the person they were interested in) lives right in the City\". Alan Johnston is the only BBC correspondent who constantly lives in Gaza City - he has been living there for three years, which let him win respect among the Palestinians. Meanwhile, it is known that Alan Johnston worked in collaboration with Hamas organization (representatives of which called as well for Johnston's release) to prepare a series of publications about contacts between American security services and Chechen militants in Iraq. Apparently, Johnston's investigations motivated Chechen militants kidnap him and supposedly kill.",
