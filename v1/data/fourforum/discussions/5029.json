   "I recently found some creation science forum:\n http://www.evolutionfairytale.com/forum/index.php \n and found a recently set up thread on the theory of creation.\n \n \nPerhaps those who are more knowledgeable on this can tell me...\n \n The main purpose of a scientific theory is to establish a model that can explain phenomena observed in the natural world. An example is that we find chemical reactions always result in the same amount of mass as when you started. This, along with many other observations led to atomic theory. Now, let's say that some chemical reaction was performed and it seemed as though there was mass produced by the reaction. Initially, this would be seen as an anomaly or faulty experimentation. If other people observed the same results similar conditions, an alteration of atomic theory, or a new model that is completely different from atomic theory, would have to be produced.\n \n However, even if this hypothetical experiment was confirmed, you would not throw out atomic theory as wrong without another theory to replace it. Atomic theory is a very useful model, backed up by massive amounts of observations and provides excellent predictions for the result of reactions that haven't occurred. To replace that, a model that explains all those previous observations plus this new anomaly must be made. It is also helpful if this new model can make predictions on phenomena that haven't yet occurred. An example would be when the periodic table was first produced; it was able to give a reasonably accurate prediction of chemicals that had not yet been discovered.\n \n The question I'm posing for this thread is, what exactly the theory of creation that will replace evolution is. This theory would have to:\n \n 1. Explain the fossil record as it stands either by showing that creation occurred multiple times or that all species existed at the same time.\n \n 2. Explain genetic modification and propose how responsible it is for alteration in organisms\n \n 3. Present a model of interaction that can make predictions about life forms in the way evolution currently does\n \n 4. Present a new system of classification (the current Kingdom Phylum Class etc etc. is mostly an evolutionary system)\n \n 5. Be experimentally verifiable. If there is no extensive evidence supporting the previous claims, they cannot form a stable theory.\n \n These are 5 criteria that need to be met to overturn evolution, though I'm sure some would argue my list is too short an far too general.\n \n I've listened to many creation v evolution arguments, but an actual creationism theory has never been presented to me. If you have any links to such information I'd appreciate the info\n\n \n \n The thread was quickly shut down by the forum because:\n \n \nthe questions were not actually questions, but demands. Only projects one type of response. One we try to stay away from here at this forum. \n \n \n okay... maybe he was a little pushy, but it made me wonder about this issue. I looked at some of the links presented by creationists; a book that attacks evolutionary biology by an electrical engineer, and a long rant about a false dichotomy established by evolutionists where they will reject any theory that doesn't correspond to a philosophy of naturalism.\n \n The latter(http://www.trueorigin.org/creatheory.asp ) actually presented one aspect of a theory of creation. That being that all creatures started off with all the genetic information they needed and that observed change in animals is a degredation of information. This runs counter to evolutionary theory that simple unicellular organisms with simple DNA eventually became more complex.\n \n This is actually a decent claim, in the sense that it is a model that can be examined...and quickly thrown out for obvious reasons (antibiotic resistance, why are all creatures on earth so similar in genetic makeup) I was wondering if anyone could bolster this claim or present another theory of creation. Really, unless some kind of theory is presented, all you are doing is bashing evolution. I can bash the laws of motion too (not well, though) but it doesn't disprove them. Perhaps I'm a little pushy too, but I find it annoying when truth is replaced with...other things.",
