   "Learning from religious fanaticism can prevent future atrocities \n \n by Eugene Ramirez (.....Vegan, graduate student, Latino, spiritual, progressive-liberal residing in San Antonio, Tx -- More of my editorials can be read at http://www.EugeneRamirez.com/html/editorials.html)\n \n As we reflect back upon history, one thing remains clear regardless of one's religious affiliation or no affiliation: More people have died in the name of God than any other way throughout history. \n \n Indeed, for hundreds of years, religious elites and common people have used their own religious interpretation (and passed down interpretation) to oppress based on gender, sexual orientation, religion and ethnicity. We have come to know of the atrocities that were all tied to religion such as the Holocaust, African-American enslavement, and the persecution of Jews. \n \n In his book, \"Holy Horrors: An Illustrated History of Religious Murder and Madness,\" James A. Haught chronicles a thousand years of religious hate ranging from the witch hunts, to the numerous crusades, to the Holy Inquisition, to the religious anti-Semitic influence that later fueled the Holocaust. Haught says, \"Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burned, tortured, fined, and imprisoned, yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity. What has been the effect of the coercion? To make one half of the world fools and the other half hypocrites.\" Furthermore, theologian Richard Rubenstein wrote that the Nazis \"did not invent a new villain...they took over the 2,000-year-old Christian tradition of the Jew as a villain. The roots of the death camps must be sought in the mythic structure of Christianity.\" \n \n We have also seen throughout history how numerous religious leaders and common people have pointed to specific passages in the Bible that have been used to validate slavery. One insightful book, \"Noah's Curse: The Biblical Justification of American Slavery,\" by Stephen R. Haynes, further shows how just \"one\" biblical passage fueled anti-African-American sentiment over the course of hundreds of years. The biblical passage, \"A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren,\" reads Noah's curse on Ham. Ham is later identified as the ancestor of black Africans, and this particular biblical passage is just one that has been used historically to justify African-American slavery. Also many Christian clergymen throughout history were pro-slavery. Historian Larry Hise says in his book, \"Pro Slavery,\" that ministers \"wrote almost half of all defenses of slavery published in America.\" He also lists more than 250 religious men who used the Bible to prove white people were entitled to own black people. \n \n Similarly, Hitler and other anti-Semitic leaders throughout history have used biblical passages to validate the persecution of Jews. Here is just one passage that fueled anti-Semitism: \"You suffered from your own countrymen the same things those churches suffered from the Jews, who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to all men in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit. The wrath of God has come upon them at last.\" (1 Thessalonians 2:14-16). \n \n In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II issued a historical pardon at St. Peter's Basilica regarding the Catholic Church's prime role in the persecution of Jews for the past 1,000 years. In addition, they also released a document that named (and officially validated) other multiple \"sins\" on their part including the Holocaust, Inquisition, Crusades and other religious acts. \n \n Not surprisingly, comparable negative sentiment that existed hundreds of years ago against African-Americans and Jews, fixated on non-heterosexuals around 50 years ago during its national peak. True, much progress has been made for gay and bisexual rights. But even today, when discussing bisexuality and heterosexuality, some people are quick to (just as in history) point to biblical passages that condemn anyone who is not heterosexual. \n \n Earlier this year we witnessed a progressive change in history as gay and bisexual men and women fought back against hegemonic norms and married in San Francisco. With the right time to pass, it will not be long when equal marriage rights under the law will be given to non-heterosexuals; similar to the way segregation was outlawed and ruled unconstitutional in the 1960s despite such opposition. \n \n Still, some do not consider gay and bisexual rights a \"civil rights\" issue. However, Coretta Scott King, wife of the late Martin Luther King Jr., disagrees with them. In 1998, on the 30th anniversary of her husband's assassination she commented: \"I still hear people say that I should... stick to the issue of racial justice, but I hasten to remind them Martin Luther King Jr. said, 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.' \" I appeal to everyone who believes in Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream to make room at the table of brother-and-sisterhood for lesbian and gay (and bisexual) people.\" \n \n Clearly, religion has also been used against women throughout history, which has solidly set the foundation for our dominating patriarchal world. One such biblical passage has been used to prohibit women from being ministers: \"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak.\" (I Corinthians I 4:34). Many believe this biblical passage and others like it fueled misogynistic beliefs at the time, which viewed women as merely second-class citizens. Not long after, The Women's Suffrage Movement was a prime example of how women fought against the male-dominated world. Finally with the passage of the 19th Amendment, women got their long-deserved right to vote. \n \n \n Yes, it is true more people have died in the name of God throughout our history than any other way. So it behooves us today to not forget our history, for we may be doomed to repeat it. As we have seen through hundreds of years, indeed it has been repeated. I know I will never identify myself as a Catholic or with any other religion that is not in line with my life-changing (progressive) and liberal beliefs. However, I do believe in God very much and always will; there is a higher Creator, and I believe that our higher Creator would want us to most definitely learn from our horrid history, so that we will never repeat it again. The time is now for us to continue to fight for civil rights in all aspects. The work is never done!",
