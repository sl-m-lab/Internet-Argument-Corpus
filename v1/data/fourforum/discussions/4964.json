   "ABORTION AS A CHOICE:\n A Facts-Only Analysis\n \n For the purposes of this analysis, religion and other group opinions will be foregone in order to preserve plausibility and in turn attempt to create a less fallible stance about the legality and the feasibility of allowing abortion to be a choice as it currently stands. Hypothetical situations will be, for the most part, ignored as well and the study will purely entail facts about existing laws and practices. The author will gather data on factual evidence, and perform an analysis of that data. The analysis is strictly the opinion of the author, and not necessarily that of any public organization with which the author is affiliated.\n \n PART I: IS THE FETUS A LIVING HUMAN BEING?\n \n On April 1, 2004 President Bush signed into law the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. The law covers the \"child in utero,\" defined as \"a member of the species homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.\" The law explicitly provides that it does not apply to any abortion to which a woman has consented, to any act of the mother herself (legal or illegal), or to any form of medical treatment. In the 1989 case of Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to invalidate a Missouri statute that declares that \"the life of each human being begins at conception,\" that \"unborn children have protectable interests in life, health, and well-being,\" and that all state laws (including criminal laws) \"shall be interpreted and construed to acknowledge on behalf of the unborn child at every stage of development, all the rights, privileges, and immunities available to other persons, citizens, and residents of this state.\" On July 25, 2000, the House passed on a vote of 417-0 a bill that contained the same definition of \"child in utero\" and that embodied the same basic legal principle. That bill, the Innocent Child Protection Act, said that no state or federal authority may \"carry out a sentence of death on a woman while she carries a child in utero,\" as to do so would claim two lives. As the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled in upholding the Minnesota unborn victims law, \"The possibility that a female homicide victim of childbearing age may be pregnant is a possibility that an assaulter may not safely exclude.\" [State v. Merrill, 450 N.W.2d 318 (Minn. 1990)]. In order to win a conviction under the law, it would be necessary for the prosecution to (1) prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a member of the species homo sapiens existed and was \"carried in the womb,\" which would be utterly impossible until after the embryo had implanted in the womb and sent out the chemical signals that announce his or her presence (i.e., after implantation); and (2) prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant acted with criminal malice towards some victim (most often, the mother) and violated one of the federal laws dealing with crimes of violence; and (3) prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant's criminal conduct caused the death of the child in utero.\n In the case of an abortion as a choice, proof beyond a reasonable doubt exists that a fetus did in fact exist, and that the actions of the mother did in fact cause the death of said child in utero. What remains in debate is whether the mother is acting with criminal malice when she undergoes an abortion. This provides the reference point for the hypothetical situations. If the mother chooses to kill the fetus, and that killing is not out of self defense as defined by law (the mother's life legitimately threatened,) then legal precedence shows that the act of abortion as a choice is, in fact a violation of the rights of that fetus.\n Therefore, in all cases except that of a willing abortion, a human fetus in the womb at any stage of development is considered by all legal accounts to be a living human being, with the same rights; rights which must be protected by the government of these United States, which exists, as is stated in the constitution and the declaration of independence, to do so. \n \n (To be continued...)\n \n For more information on this topic please read http://www.friesian.com/abortion.htm, one of the best essays I've read on the subject.

   "ABORTION AS A CHOICE:\n A Facts-Only Analysis\n\n \n I am waiting for the rest, but I did want to make a couple of comments.\n \n \nOn April 1, 2004 President Bush signed into law the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.\n\n \n I cannot speak for all of the laws (though, coming from you they probably are the same), but the UVVA was purely a propaganda law. The vast majority of murder cases are tried under state law, which the UVVA would not affect. There was an alternative version of this bill proposed, which identified the pregnant woman as the victim and contained a provision to affect state laws but was voted against by the very same people who voted for the UVVA. This bill was proposed to be used exactly as you're using it, as a precedent for a national ban on abortion, not to help pregnant women.\n \n \nIf the mother chooses to kill the fetus, and that killing is not out of self defense as defined by law (the mother's life legitimately threatened,) then legal precedence shows that the act of abortion as a choice is, in fact a violation of the rights of that fetus.\n\n \n There are different situations where killing is ruled justifiable other than purely self-defense. Criminal trespass and burglary are both crimes that certain states allow a citizen to kill the felon. Executions are legal killing, the aforementioned self-defense is legal killing, war is legal killing, and abortion is legal killing. What is your justification that abortion should not be?\n \n \nTherefore, in all cases except that of a willing abortion, a human fetus in the womb at any stage of development is considered by all legal accounts to be a living human being, with the same rights; rights which must be protected by the government of these United States, which exists, as is stated in the constitution and the declaration of independence, to do so. \n\n \n Yet, what of the woman's rights? The gov't does not have the power to violate an individual's rights, even to ensure the survival of another. Nor does the Federal Gov't have the Constitutional power to regulate pregnancy.\n \n \n\n For more information on this topic please read http://www.friesian.com/abortion.htm\n\n \n An interesting article, worthy of a further read.",

   "I'm not sure how demonstrating that anti-abortion campaigners have managed to get laws enacted to claim full human rights for the feotus in other circumstances actually adds anything to a debate over whether it should have them. It's a simply an appeal to authority which is a logical fallacy. That's not to say that the feotus isn't fully human, just that that text does not prove it.",
