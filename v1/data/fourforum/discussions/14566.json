   "New-home sales hit a 40-year low\n \n Sales of new homes dropped to their lowest level since the government started tracking the numbers more than four decades ago, offering an ominous sign for the direction of the already fragile housing market.\n \n The Commerce Department's report, released Wednesday, was the second this week to underscore home buyers' crumbling confidence.\n \n It said new homes sold in July at an annual rate of 276,000, off 12.4 percent from June's pace while plummeting 32.4 percent from a year earlier. That's the lowest level since 1963 and far worse than what analysts expected.\n \n The report comes a day after the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes in July plunged to their lowest point in more than a decade. Sales were down 27.2 percent from June, the largest monthly drop since 1968. \n\n \n washingtonpost.com\n \n I just dont understand why so many people were especially surprised by this.",
