   "Choscura,\n \ni'm fully aware that there is historical evidence that jesus existed. there is simply no proof that he is what he is claimed to be. the loch ness monster thing wasn't for rhetoric, theres as much or more proof that it exists- photographic evidence, as opposed to a stupifying take on life, love, and all things spiritual that has been written down. just because you believe it doesn't make it true.\n\n So that we may better understand your position perhaps you can elaborate on what you believe. \n \n In scripture Jesus claims to be God. Is it your view that: \n 1. he, in fact, did not claim this but his followers embellished \n 2.He claimed to be God to prop himself up as a Messiah/gain power among his people--that is he was a liar \n 3. he claimed to be God but was delusional?\n \n \nthis was a mild observation i made, nothing more. i'm not offended in any way, shape or form by religion-except when it is forced onto others (if anyone has seen or had an exorcism performed on them, you'll know what i mean). as for never having tested god's teachings, it will probably surprise you to know that i was one of the most devout christian kids you would ever have met- i carried a bible just about everywhere, i ignored evolution, i fully believed that there was a god and that his son jesus died for me to go to heaven with all of my friends. i believed in hell, the devil, all of it. every thing. the way i am today is not a night-and day difference to what i was- i still hold many of the morals of christianity close (killing is bad, cheating is bad, you shouldn't steal, etc), but i looked around one day and said 'you know? even an athiest could follow this, if he had motivation.' and in that instant, i saw what the whole heaven and hell thing ultimately was: motivation. do this, and you go to heaven. do this and you go to hell. and from there it was a gradual chain reaction: i stopped seeing god as the happy father of the world who wanted everyone to be happy with him, and started seeing him as a cold-hearted conniving sonofabitch not terribly different from satan: either way, it was two equal factions both trying to get people to die and go to THEIR territory. and when i saw that, i said 'to hell with this. i'm out'. the point i'm at now is that even if either god or satan or jesus or any of the popular deities exist, most of them don't deserve to be worshipped, because they've started a big holy dick-measuring contest that has killed more people than every plague, famine, and disaster combined. you don't have to look very far to see that. my feeling on christianity have gone from 'warm and fuzzy' to a complete disdain for what by rights should be little more than a self-destructive hobby.\n\n Do you think these evils are a product of God's doing or of man's doing \"in the name of God?\"",

   "Did Jesus Claim To Be God?  \n \n Among the religious leaders who have attained a large following throughout history, Jesus Christ is unique in the fact that He alone claimed to be God in human flesh. A common misconception is that some or many of the leaders of the world's religions made similar claims, but this is simply not the case. \n Buddha did not claim to be God; Moses never said that he was Yahweh; Mohammed did not identify himself to be Ahura Mazda. Yet Jesus, the carpenter from Nazareth, said that he who has seen him (Jesus) has seen the Father (John 14:9).\n \n The claims of Christ are many and varied. He said that He existed before Abraham (John 8:58), and that He was equal with the Father (John 14:9). The New Testament equated Jesus as the creator of the universe (John 1:3), and that He is the one who holds everything together (Colossians 1:17). The apostle Paul says that God was manifest in the flesh (1 Timothy 3:16, KJV), and John the evangelist says that \"the Word was God\" (John 1:1). The united testimony of Jesus and the writers of the New Testament is that He was more than mere man; He was God.  \n \n Not only did His friends notice that He claimed to be God, but so did His enemies as well. There may be some doubt today among the skeptics who refuse to examine the evidence, but there was no doubt on the part of the Jewish authorities. When Jesus asked them why they wanted to stone Him, they replied, \"For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God\" (John 10:33, NASB).\n \n This fact separates Jesus from the other religious figures. In the major religions of the world, the teachings -- not the teacher -- are all-important. \n Confucianism is a set of teachings; Confucius is not important. Islam is the revelation of Allah, with Mohammed being the prophet, and Buddhism emphasizes the principles of the Buddha and not Buddha himself. This is especially true of Hinduism, where there is no historic founder. \n However, at the center of Christianity is the person of Jesus Christ. Jesus did not just claim to be teaching mankind the truth; He claimed that He was the truth (John 14:6).\n \n What Jesus taught is not the important aspect of Christianity, but what is important is who Jesus was. Was He the Son of God? Is He the only way a person can reach God? This was the claim He made for Himself. \n Suppose this very night the President of the United States appeared on all the major networks and proclaimed that \"I am God Almighty. I have the power to forgive sin. I have the authority to raise my life back from the dead.\"\n \n He would be quickly and quietly shut off the air, led away, and replaced by the Vice-President. Anybody who would dare make such claims would have to be either out of his mind or a liar, unless he was God. \n This is exactly the case with Jesus. He clearly claimed all these things and more. If He is God, as He claimed, we must believe in Him, and if He is not, then we should have nothing to do with Him. Jesus is either Lord of all or not Lord at all.\n \n Yes, Jesus claimed to be God. Why should anyone believe it? After all, merely claiming to be something does not make it true. Where's the evidence that Jesus is God?\n \n The Bible gives various reasons, including miracles and fulfilled prophecy, that are intended to convince us that Jesus is the one whom He said He was (John 20:30, 31). The main reason, or the sign which Jesus Himself said would demonstrate that He was the Son of God, was His resurrection from the dead.\n \n When asked for a sign from the religious leaders, Jesus replied, \"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth\" (Matthew 12:40, RSV).\n \n In another place He said, when asked for a sign, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up . . . but he spake of the temple of his body\" (John 2:19, 21, KJV). The ability to raise His life back from the dead was the sign that separates Him not only from all other religious leaders, but also from anyone else who has ever lived.\n \n Anyone wishing to refute the case for Christianity must explain away the story of the resurrection. Therefore, according to the Bible, Jesus proves to be the Son of God by coming back from the dead (Romans 1:4). The evidence is overwhelming that Jesus did rise from the grave, and it is this fact that proves Jesus to be God.\n \n (This is an excerpt from the book, \"Answers to Tough Questions,\" by Josh McDowell and Don Stewart.)",

The Mighty God (Isa 9:6), the great God and Savior (Hos 1:7, w Tit 2:13), God over all (Ro 9:5), God the Judge (Ecc 12:14, w 1Co 4:5; 2Co 5:10; 2Ti 4:1), Immanuel (Isa 7:14, w Mt 1:23), Lord of lords and King of kings (Da 10:17, w Rev 1:5; 17:14), the Holy and Righteous One (1Sa 2:2, w Ac 3:14).\n \n Eternity of:\n \n Called everlasting Father (Isa 9:6). Was before creation (Jn 1:1-2, 15; 17:5,24; Col 1:17; 2Ti 1:9). Was from the beginning (1Jn 2:13). \n \n Jesus, Lord God of the Sabbath - Mark Chapter 2\n \n It happened that he was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields, and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain. The Pharisees said to him, \"Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?\" He said to them, \"Did you never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry--he, and those who were with him? How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?\" He said to them, \"The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.\" \n \n Judaism teaches that there was only one Lord of the Sabbath - God Himself. By stating that He Himself is the Lord of the Sabbath, Jesus makes a clear declaration of His own divinity.\n \n And this is only a very small sampling of the Scriptural evidences for the deity of Christ.\n \n Jesus is God!\n\n \n \n Wow, I will point out that many of these quotes are from the Old testament, and had nothing to do with 'CHrist' what so ever (if you read those quotes in CONTEXT that is). \n \n I would have to say that makes your entire cut/paste from some bible searching tool for the word 'god' irrelavent.",

   "Wow, I will point out that many of these quotes are from the Old testament, and had nothing to do with 'CHrist' what so ever (if you read those quotes in CONTEXT that is).\n\n \n Ha. Let's take one OT example:\n \n Isaiah 9:6 For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\" \n \n This verse points out the inescapable fact that the Messiah is God Almighty appearing in human form. That this passage was considered Messianic is evident from the fact that verse 7 says that the Child would sit on the throne of David forever, a description which only fits the Messiah. \n \n In the JEWISH Targum of Isaiah we read: \"His name has been called from old, Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, He who lives forever, the Anointed One (Messiah), in whose days peace shall increase upon us.\" \n \n Pereq Shalom: R. Yose the Galilean said: \"The name of the Messiah is Peace, for it is said, \"Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\" \n \n Midrash Mishle, S. Buber edition: The Messiah is called by eight names: Yinnon, Tzemah, Pele [\"Miracle\"], Yo'etz [\"Counselor\"], Mashiah [\"Messiah\"], El [\"God\"], Gibbor [\"Hero\"], and Avi 'Ad Shalom [\"Eternal Father of Peace\"] \n \n Whoever this Child is one thing remains certain - This Child must shine forth from Galilee according to Isaiah 9:1: \n 'Nevertheless, there will be no more gloom for those who were in distress. In the past He humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali but in the future He will honor Galilee of the Gentiles, by the way of the sea along the Jordan...'\n \n NOTE: In an attempt to avoid the impact of this passage's significance to the divinity of the Messiah, certain Jewish Publications have translated it in a way as to suggest that the divine titles are not messianic in nature. Rather, they are descriptions of God: For a child has been born to us, a son has been given to us, and the dominion will rest on his shoulder; the Wondrous Adviser, Mighty God, eternal Father, called his name Sar-shalom [Prince of peace]. (This appears as Isaiah 9:5 in the Stone Edition Tanakh, Arts Scroll Series, published by Mesorah Publications Ltd.; Brooklyn, NY, 1998) \n \n The great Jewish rabbi Ibn Ezra responds: There are some interpreters who say that 'wonderful, counselor, mighty God, everlasting Father' are the names of God, and that only 'prince of peace' is the name of the child. But according to my view, the right interpretation is that they are all the names of the child. (Walter Riggans, Yeshua Ben David [Wowborough, East Sussex; MARC, 1995], p. 370) - jesusplusnothing.com\n \n And there are many, many more examples. Pray that the Holy Spirit opens your eyes.",

   "Orion, not only is all that a poor attempt to regurgitate all the failed allegations that you've tried to foist on people through the years (which have been refuted bit by bit ad nauseum in many forums), but it shows a profound, liberal bias that goes against the grain of legitimate conservative scholarship and classical Biblical exegesis. I highly recommend you invest in something other than the liberal rags you continue to quote / cut and paste from. Already you've been provided, in my previous posts, evidence that your \"creation / Genesis doublets\" are ill-conceived and unwarranted; that your \"failed prophecy\" arguments (Tyre, for example) are lacking in merit; and that even most mainstream, Orthodox Jews don't fall for your rabid attempts to try to tell them God did not author their Torah.\n \n But even more revealing than your ill-conceived attempts to attack the Word of God is your continued failure to provide even the most basic evidences and substance for your own \"all-paths-lead-to-God\" liberal mantra. You STILL have not been able to tell people here who your so-called \"god\" is, where he / she / it lives, much less provide any compelling evidence to back up this feel-good fantasy of yours. So again, all you are able to do is bury your head in the sand over that and continue with your all-out attacks on Jesus Christ and the Bible. \n \n All in all, it is a very feeble (more like non-existent) attempt on your part to establish your own credibility for your own beliefs.
