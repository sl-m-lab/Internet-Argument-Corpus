Interesting to say the least.\n \n http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x32cxf_yuri-bezmenov\n\n \n WOW, TRIGGER, and to think that this interview was given in 1986. We are seeing the results of all of his fears now as we sit on the brink of the total collapse of America's socioeconomic system.\n \n And what is so telling about his warning was that he foresaw the spirit of tolerance and political correctness which has so dumbed down the so called intellectuals who believe only they are sophisticated enough to embrace these socialistic beliefs. And it is they who will be eliminated first once they actually accomplish the goals of the collective. \n \n As I have said in so many debates here to these pseudo intellectuals who wallow in their self important superiority; it is they who look down on we who embrace the traditions and faith in God of our Fathers, who are the true sheep being led to a slaughter which is founded upon and sustained by the lies of total and perfect equality which are doled out by elitists who have no intention at all of sharing the wealth with these followers who prove how useless they are since they were so easily manipulated.\n \n He even mentioned the moral dumbing down of society and the acceptance of homosexuality as a tool to destroy this society just as I have argued, as he so matter of factly said that the conquering powers that be wont allow them to survive for 2 seconds once they win power. \n \n How sad it is that it takes an ex-KGB guy to voice, and agree with what I, a bible believing American has seen coming all along. Anyway, great video and very informative. Thanks for posting it. Sadly though, it will probably be wasted on those who are the very victims its warning is meant for. emoticon_xagree",

   "Central planning industrialised both the USSR and China in record time, far faster than would have happened in a free market. Economically central planning can be quite effective, though not in all cases.\n \n And trotting out American exceptionalism as an argument really doesn't hold any water.\n\n \n Really Jo, I don't know how you can say this and still be dealing from a realistic perspective. How do you explain that with all of the so called industrialization which took place in the USSr over 70 years, positive production which served ALL the people remained nothing more than a dream to one day be attained. Housewives would go the the grocery store at 8:00 AM, wait in a line for 6 hours only to receive a ticket which doled out the bare minimum to last the family another week. Selection was nonexistent. Rationing of all the staples of life was the norm. And Soviet Money wasn't any good anywhere outside of the Soviet Block because it wasn't accepted on the world monetary system since it had no real value.\n \n And speaking of China, which you socialists love to hold up as a current example of how successful socialism can be, are you aware that of the approximately 1.7 billion people there, only around 350 million of them (and that might be generous) have qualities of life which resemble 20th century technology and lifestyles? All the rest live in villages with a pre-19th century quality of life. I read once that one of the major contributing factors of Chinese air pollution was because more than a billion chinese still rely on burning wood for cooking and heating their homes. \n \n If the USA had a majority of its population which still lived without electricity, running water and plumbing in this day and age, while only 20% lived as the educated elite does in China, we would be held up as the greatest failure of any political system in history. And yet, you refer to these failed systems as if they actually raise the quality of life across the board for their citizens.",

Not me. And wasn't the whole concept of Central Planning originally set out to build a system that produced directly for people's needs and not at all for profit? \"There was a period early in Soviet life when it was argued that the Soviet worker and manager would work because of their enthusiasm for the revolution and their ideological fervor. That phase passed rather quickly.\"1 Because use of markets violated Marxist ideology, there was only one system of coordination possible. A system of central planning evolved; a system in which all decisions about what people needed were decided from the top.\n \n \nI'd love to see you argue that Czarist Russia was a better place to live. Sure they both sucked, but c'mon. The lost of a huge portion of Russia in WWI from the incompetence of the Czarist state is pretty embarrassing.\n \n \n Czarist Russia was very unorganized and poor. There was no social or political infrastructure to speak of; i agree with all of that. But neither was their political oversight or intrusions into the lives of the millions of little family farms throughout Russia. The people had market places where they sold what they grew, they traded amongst themselves and they sold their talents as needed by their neighbors. In short, they were happy. Why do you think that Lenin had to murder tens of millions of Russians in order to sell his new political system to the masses? It's because they immediately rejected the oppressive hand of communist oversight and the forced labor required in order to serve the so called motherland.

South Korea had a pretty crappy standard of living under the Park dictatorship and look at where they are now. Central planning when done right can lead to freedom and prosperity.\n \n \n We're talking about different aspects of what central planning accomplished child. Let me try to clarify. Let's say you're a capitalist to my communist. And we both must make shoes. To see how this system worked, consider how the operator of a shoe factory in the United States would make decisions. His major concern would be whether he could sell at a profit the shoes he made. In the Soviet Union, however, profit was of no concern to the manager of the state-owned shoe factory. Neither did he worry about selling the shoes. His only concern was to produce what he was told to produce, and if he could do that, both he and the workers of the plant received sizable bonuses. The problem the Soviet Union had was that it is very difficult to specify in physical terms what a manager should do. (If you do not believe this, try to write down a set of instructions specifying what sort of shoes should be produced. Remember, instructions to produce \"good shoes\" or \"attractive shoes\" involve instructions that are not measurable.) The Soviet Union produced huge numbers of shoes that no one would buy because they were of such low quality.\n \n \nAgain, what time frame are you operating under? The US took 150 years to get to an strong industrial wealthy level. Russia did it in 50. South Korea did it in 35. England took god knows how long, at least three centuries. \n\n \n Forget about South Korea for the sake of this debate, because they are democratic and don't fit the communist criteria being discussed. But regarding the Soviet's strong industrial wealth, so what? What and who did it benefit? Not the people who built it. Only a massively mismanaged, oppressive, brutal political infrastructure which wielded that system like a club over the people who were abused by it. \n \n \nYour history sucks. China and the USSR did not export to the world. They had their own spheres of influence and trading. One of the few exports the USSR did was in caviar. My old boss had a caviar tin from the 1970s from the USSR state caviar company. The rest was military to select countries outside of the warsaw pact. Much of the rest was to the warsaw pact countries.\n \n \n Look child, we're speaking about 2 separate countries with different trading practices so don't nickel and dime me to death, and focus on irrelevant minutia as you ignore the point I'm making. I know the Soviets traded mainly within their sphere of the Eastern Bloc Countries, but they also traded certain products to the west, mainly russian caviar and vodka, both of which I've had. The reason why the west didn't buy much else from them was because most of what they manufactured sucked in comparison to our standards of style and quality. \n \n As for China, she is selling her products all over the world, and yet only around 20% of the chinese populace is living in 20th century standards of living.

That's not how all central planning is done. Clearly that wasn't the focus in the USSR given that much of the production was for military. Remember that the USSR was not a Communist society in many ways, rather an Authoritarian Dictatorship. There were classes. There wasn't a democracy of the worker. Sure it did practice some elements of Marxism such as collectivization (which by the way China abandoned in the 70s), but it failed so many other criteria set forth by Marx. \n \n \nCzarist Russia was very unorganized and poor.

Did I remind you that for much of its time, Czarist Russia was a serf state? That's NOT HAPPY. Furthermore taxation was pretty high to support the monarchy and soldiers were drafted and considered dead to their communities. Russia was not a happy place. \n \n \nWhy do you think that Lenin had to murder tens of millions of Russians in order to sell his new political system to the masses? It's because they immediately rejected the oppressive hand of communist oversight and the forced labor required in order to serve the so called motherland.

During WWI during the Czarist attempt to defend Russia (and even before), farmers routinely had their farm animals and crops taken from them leaving only the barest of the bare. That really didn't change except to whom the foodstuffs were going to. Like I said, Czarist Russia wasn't a happy place. No one is arguing that the USSR was a good place to be. \n \n \nWe're talking about different aspects of what central planning accomplished child.\n\n \n Of course. Both I and the previous poster were discussing how effective central planning is in industrializing in a short period of time. You seem not want to discuss that. No one is arguing that central planning can be wasteful, destructive and ineffective. However, it has been proven to be effective, useful and fast. Central planning is really just an idea. Whether or not it is good depends on who is practicing it and how. Once again, central planning can rapidly industrialize a country much faster then capitalism can. That is the central point I've been trying to make all along and something you don't want to discuss. \n \n \nForget about South Korea for the sake of this debate, because they are democratic and don't fit the communist criteria being discussed.\n\n \n Bone up on your history. South Korea used to be a dictatorship practicing 5 year plans with lots of central planning. Taiwan was a dictatorship that practiced modified central planning. Singapore used to be a dictatorship as well with central planning. It does work. It just depends on how and who is using it. Therefore you cannot toss it out in a discussion on central planning. \n \n \nBut regarding the Soviet's strong industrial wealth, so what? What and who did it benefit? Not the people who built it. Only a massively mismanaged, oppressive, brutal political infrastructure which wielded that system like a club over the people who were abused by it.\n\n \n No one disagrees. You seem unwillingly to discuss the actual issue here: the effectiveness of central planning in industrializing a country in a short period of time. No one made arguments whether or not that leads to a much better life. There are cases where it did and where it did not, but the key issue is in that virtually all, they lead to rapid industrializing that no capitalist country has been able to match. Even now developmental economists are arguing that central planning in the South Korean/China style is the best approach for 3rd world countries to jump start their economies. \n \n \nLook child, we're speaking about 2 separate countries with different trading practices so don't nickel and dime me to death, and focus on irrelevant minutia as you ignore the point I'm making.\n\n \n You miss major historical points and get major historical points wrong. \n \n \nI know the Soviets traded mainly within their sphere of the Eastern Bloc Countries, but they also traded certain products to the west, mainly russian caviar and vodka, both of which I've had. The reason why the west didn't buy much else from them was because most of what they manufactured sucked in comparison to our standards of style and quality.\n\n \n Yes and no. Both China and the USSR had direct policies of not engaging in trade with the West. Part of Marxism called for severing ties with the free trade framework that Marx saw as as causing huge detriments to the poor around the world (read up on India during the 50s and 60s for why their economy sucked, it's called Import Substitution). And the USSR and China rarely imported anything. A notable exception is when the USSR imported millions of US grain to feed its people. And you forget that much of the USSR economy was military based. Huge amounts of their exports were weapons, which in some regards were better then our own. Early on US tanks were terrible. Only until the Abrams were our tanks significently superior. Russian personal anti-air weapons are superior in cost and reliability, the AK-47 changed the world, god knows how many torpedoes you need to sink a Typhoon. Some of their military exports were damn good. The USSR did not focus on producing consumer goods, it's no wonder why no one bought those goods. \n \n \nAs for China, she is selling her products all over the world, and yet only around 20% of the chinese populace is living in 20th century standards of living. Why doesn't that bother you?\n\n \n Not really. China is a good example of what a Communist country would not look like. Much of that wealth is concentrated in the party. Interestingly enough, some of the richest people were the foot soldiers in the various revolutions that decried capitalism. And remember that much of China's poor is in the rural areas. China is practicing cowboy capitalism with little regulatory framework (if any). That tends to result in the masses getting screwed and a few getting super rich and the environment going to pot. Mao is rolling in his grave. \n \n \nLet me ask you this child, how many books have been written since the USSR's collapse by average russian citizens decrying the loss of such a wonderful political system, and the personal opportunities for wealth that it offered? I would say none.\n\n \n Where did I say it was a wonderful system? Oh wait, I didn't, you're lying. I focused on GDP and industrialization, both of which rapidly rose due to central planning. Notice I stated that both systems sucked and that neither was a happy place.\n \n \nHappiness is different than the misery index.\n\n \n Then how can you compare the two? \n \n That link is some sad as it ignores current and quite frankly past developments in the use of central planning. The Manhattan project was centrally planned. The construction of Me262s that gave us serious problems towards the end of WWII was centrally planning. The cherry blossoms that destroyed and damaged hundreds of US ships in the pacific was centrally planned. Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea, and now China stand has examples of how central planning can work. \n \n The idea that central planning is an entirely flawed idea is foolish and ignores reality. \n \n It is its agents that determine whether or not it works.",

Are you actually excusing him as if it wasn't his orders which killed those uncountable masses of innocent people?\n\n \n There's a difference between pushing policies you believe will help your people improve the quality of their lives and deliberately giving orders to have millions of your people murdered in various purges. \n \n Mao pushed policies he believed would help his people. His ignorance resulted in poor policies. Stalin directly ordered assassinations and purges. There is a huge difference between the two. \n \n Notice I never said that Mao's policies didn't get these people killed. Learn to read better. \n \n \nI marvel at how you can just as a matter of fact attribute his mass murder to ignorance, but not being evil. Are you saying that ignorant people can't also be evil? And with what evidence do you assert that he wasn't also acting due to an irrational paranoia to retain power at all cost? Can you prove that statement?\n\n \n Look at the great leap forward. I know your history is on par with a 4th grader, but bare with me. Mao deliberately pushed policies to industrialize to match England. He believed that steel production could be done in what is commonly called backyard furnaces. The problem was that Mao was ignorant to metallurgy and how to actually produce steel. Very little to no actual steel was produced and environmental damage was pretty high, not to mention loss of labor in food production and land for food production. That's ignorance. Not malevolence. Malevolence would be ordering millions of people to be worked to death out of sheer paranoia. It's not surprisingly that the Politburo of China today is almost entirely engineers. They learned their lesson of how bad science and ignorance can lead to bad policies. \n \n \nWho said that China is equal to, or worse than China was 40 years ago?\n\n \n He implied that China was no better off. That's wrong. \n \n \nAll one need say is that it is still oppressive and dictatorial in its character and its Godless value system. Do the forced labor camps still exist in order to maintain acceptable levels of production? YES! Are prisoners forced to manufacture goods for free? YES! Are people who disagree with government policies still sent into reeducation camps until they're made to accept the status quo? YES!\n\n \n You realize that the CCCP has state backed Christian Churches? Furthermore, much of China is either Buddhist or Taoist. Not exactly \"Godless value system.\" And forced labor camps only exist in the prisons. Wal-Mart got some flak for sub contracting to firms who had deals with the state who then used prison labor. Pretty bad. \n \n I see you won't actually argue the economics. Not surprisingly. No one is arguing that China is a perfect society. You seem to be pretending am I. \n \n \nIt seems that as long as China is making a profit, you are totally blind to the lack of any and all freedoms their people live under.\n\n \n Sorry, not a bleeding heart liberal like you are. And increasing economic wealth invariably leads to demands for increased political choices and freedoms. \n \n And where am I blind? All you seem to want to discuss is emotional human rights. This is an economic discussion. \n \n \nYou just can't stop yourself from making a jab at me can you! emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Your history is really weak. Really weak.",

Chinese State Sanctioned Church Leader Defends Government Limits On Religous Freedom Not-A-Pundit: The Renaissance\n \n \nAnd forced labor camps only exist in the prisons. Wal-Mart got some flak for sub contracting to firms who had deals with the state who then used prison labor. Pretty bad.\n \n \n Another lie. Either that or you are just ignorant as you accuse me of being. Or you're in denial of the historical facts. Which is it child? You tell me! Here, from Human Rights Watch is the lowdown on China's solution for meeting manufacturing requirements. Here's an excerpt from yet another valid source I produce in order to counter your ignorant opinion.\n The Laogai System\n \n The Laogai system consists of three distinct categories of reform: convict labor (Laogai), re-education through labor (Laojiao), and forced job placement (Jiuye). The Laogai Research Foundation, a non-governmental organization (NGO) in the United States, estimates that there are almost 1,100 labor institutions in the Laogai system with an estimated 6.8 million inmates.\n \n Laogai, the most common type of reform, exists for prisoners convicted of crimes under the Chinese Criminal Code. Article 41 of the criminal code states that anyone sentenced for a crime \"who is able to work, shall undergo reform through labor.\" \n \n The PRC uses Laojiao to detain individuals it feels are a threat to national security or it considers unproductive. Individuals in Laojiao may be detained for up to three years. Because those in Laojiao have not committed crimes under PRC law, they are referred to as \"personnel\" rather than prisoners and they are not entitled to judicial procedure. Instead, individuals are sent to the Laojiao following administrative sentences dispensed by local public security forces. This vague detainment policy allows the PRC to avoid allegations that the individual's arrest was politically motivated and to assert that they were arrested for reasons such as \"not engaging in honest pursuits\" or \"being able-bodied but refusing to work.\"\n \n Finally, Jiuye is used by the PRC to keep individuals under government controls after the person's release from a labor camp. The Jiuye requires former detainees of the Laogai to live and work in specifically assigned locations. Under this policy, 70 percent of prisoners are held within the prison camp to continue working after completing their sentences.\n \n Each Laogai camp has both a camp name and a public name. For example, the Shanghai Municipal Prison is also called the Shanghai Printing, Stationery Factory. Financial information on 99 forced labor camp enterprises collected by Dun and Bradstreet was released on June 30, 1999. According to this data, the 99 camps had total annual sales of U.S.$842.7 million. These camps represent only 9 percent of the roughly 1,100 known Laogai camps. The extremely cheap cost of labor in the Laogai system creates a very low-priced, competitive product to export, providing the PRC additional incentive to continue its use of the Laogai system.\n \n Conditions in the Laogai System\n \n Much of the information about the Laogai system comes from former prisoners, who describe camp conditions as inhumane. Former prisoner Tong Li stated: \"The worst incident occurred after I refused to work more than the eight hour maximum day mandated by Chinese Law. At that time I was beaten by a group of inmates instructed by the police guards in the labor camp. I was not allowed to talk with other detainees in that labor camp. I had no access to newspapers, television or radio. My food rations were minimal.\" Other prisoners have testified to similar treatment.\n \n According to Harry Wu, the Executive Director of the Laogai Research Foundation, prisoners in both the Laogai and the Laojiao are given only one uniform and one pair of rubber and plastic gloves each year. They are fed three times a day, but the quantity of food depends on their daily performance and the quality of the food is poor, consisting mostly of corn gruel and corn bread. Prisoners often labor 12 hours per day or more, working at farms, mines, and different types of prison factories that manufacture a wide array of products for foreign and domestic markets.\n \n After completing the workday, inmates usually have a two-hour study period where they must read and listen to communist teachings. The camps are often overcrowded and it is common for two prisoners to sleep in the same bed and for 200 prisoners to share six showers within a half-hour period of clean-up time. While Laogai system officials claim that all prisoners have the right to prompt medical treatment, Human Rights in China, a Chinese-American NGO that investigates Laogai conditions, reports that proper, adequate, and timely medical care is a serious problem. In particularly dangerous situations, detainees work with toxic chemicals and are rarely allowed to wash their hands, even before eating. In sum, the conditions of the Laogai camps are hazardous and debilitating.Laogai: Reform Through Labor in China\n \n \nI see you won't actually argue the economics. Not surprisingly. No one is arguing that China is a perfect society. You seem to be pretending am I.\n \n \n I have proven your claims of economic success under Mao was just so much historically inaccurate propaganda which you are dumb enough to have swallowed hook line and sinker. \n \n \nSorry, not a bleeding heart liberal like you are. And increasing economic wealth invariably leads to demands for increased political choices and freedoms. \n\n \n Now this is precious people. Look here, the obvious child is calling ARCHANGEL a bleeding heart liberal. And this guy wants to be taken seriously? I apologize child, how dare I actually consider human rights as a necessary ingredient for a successful formula of National prosperity. How utterly shallow of me! And BTW, my perspective isn't a liberal one one, but is a conservative position. You see, we like all of the people to rise together in prosperity rather than only the totalitarian elitists whom you seem to be happy defending as you ignore the suffering of the unwashed masses.\n \n \nAnd where am I blind? All you seem to want to discuss is emotional human rights. This is an economic discussion. \n\n \n Child, your absolute and complete blindness of the historical facts is obvious for all to see now, and it's proven with documented evidence. emoticon_xdonno\n \n \nYour history is really weak. Really weak.\n\n \n Really? My history is weak? Then why did I submit links to support what I say as you have done nothing but offer unsubstantiated opinions which have no basis in fact at all? Can you answer that question child?",
