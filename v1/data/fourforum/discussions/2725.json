   "God doesn't want you happy, and the reason is simply this: It's bad for his business. \n \n IMO, the Bible can be viewed as God's various attempts to keep mankind miserable in this world here and now, and therefore treasuring the vague promise of the next world to come. Why people assume the next will be any better than the former is puzzling in itself, but to keep to my point of this thread consider:\n \n 1. The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil: In my estimation, the best thing man has ever done is reach for the apples, the ones whose flesh contained the magical lever which could be used to improve our station in life--knowledge. Without it, we would continue to blindly grope, ravaged by disease and hunger and ignorance, just as God had planned. This simple act so gummed up the works he had to hatch a New Plan, according to what the religionists would have us believe. \n \n 2. Onan: We learn in Genesis 38:9 that Onan spilled his seed upon the ground and the lesson religionists insist we learn from that is it is highly displeasing to God. After all, how can one be yearning for another world when heaven is at hand? Best to remain ill-adjusted, crimped and cramped, neurotic and crabby and heaven-bound than to experience the satisfaction of sexual excitement and release which leads to balanced, content individuals.\n \n 3. The Book of Lamentations: God so likes the business, he named a whole book after it. Enough said.\n \n 4. The Major and Minor Prophets: The O.T. finishes up with madmen, each trying to outdo the last, in groveling, howling like wild dogs, shredding their sackcloth, rolling in ashes, soiling their straw beds. In short, these men reach the pinnacle of holiness. Each in turn bemoans and rails against people who are going about the business of living and prospering, a full-time job in my experience. Doom and gloom they say will be the result unless the heathens become as the prophets, which is nothing short of insanity. It pleases the Lord.\n \n 5: Eye plucking: Yes, pluck it out. Go ahead, Jesus said so. Matthew 5:29. You don't need it anyway when you're praying with your eyelids shut, face skyward, hands folded, the perfect position of worthlessness to yourself and to others in need at this very moment. You won't see any pretty girls that way, whom have a way of kindling God's anger. His eyebrows become more corrugated with each new invention designed to simplify our lives.\n \n \n 6. Money: 1 Timothy 6:10 instructs us that the love of money is the root of all evil, and has become one of the most quoted lines of the Bible. It is better to my way of thinking to remember Ayn Rand's quote, \"Those who believe that money is the root of all evil would do well to ask themselves, 'what is the root of money?'\". The root of money, she explains, is freedom, and without it we are all at the mercy of the lash of the whip. With money comes the freedom necessary to pursue happiness.\n \n That's enough for now, I believe. I don't intend for the above to be all-inclusive, rather just to serve as examples of my contention that when people are prosperous and happy, it bodes ill for religion, which thrives on misfortune and pain and unhappiness. \n \n Here's hoping you need never appeal to it, and that you find happiness (the most important thing in life, IMO) here and now.",

I really can't see any reason why God, if he existed, would want us to be unhappy. However, an unhappy and scared population is much easier to manipulate than a happy and contented one. In the Middle Ages the church had huge power, largely by telling people they had to be miserable now, so that they could get into heaven later. \n \n Of course most modern Christian sects aren't quite so draconian, but old traditions die hard.",

This simple act so gummed up the works he had to hatch a New Plan, according to what the religionists would have us believe.\n\n That darn tree!! But, there were hundreds, maybe thousands of other trees that man could have chosen. Mankind could have chosen the Tree of Life. But, it was neither God nor man that spat in the soup &#8211; it was Satan. Of course it was man&#8217;s fault to fall for the lie. Knowledge could have been gained through so many other venues, but he chose Good and Evil. By doing so he placed himself in position to be disciplined. It was either that or fall prey to the Darkness forever. It&#8217;s the way of things now as a reflection of God&#8217;s plan: Parental guidance &#8211; lead our children on the right path, show them the way, then turn them loose.\n \nOnan: We learn in Genesis 38:9 that Onan spilled his seed upon the ground and the lesson religionists insist we learn from that is it is highly displeasing to God. After all, how can one be yearning for another world when heaven is at hand? Best to remain ill-adjusted, crimped and cramped, neurotic and crabby and heaven-bound than to experience the satisfaction of sexual excitement and release which leads to balanced, content individuals.\n\n Onan failed to obey the law, a duty spelled out in Deuteronomy 25:5-10 to preserve tribal inheritance. It does sound unbelievable, but if we can remove ourselves from our present state and see how life was those many years ago, we would better understand it. Again, not God&#8217;s fault. \n \n The Book of Lamentations: God so likes the business, he named a whole book after it. Enough said.\n\n To show the hardheadedness of mankind. \n It entails, through sorrow, the hardness of man&#8217;s heart toward God. Since we cannot know what it was like without this age of grace, we can only speculate how gruesome and cruel Satan was. It was this type of deceit that caused Jerusalem to fall in the first place and why Jeremiah, hurting deeply, retreated to that cave to pen the grief befallen them all. Of course, &#8220;The devil made me do it&#8221; mentality can only get us so far &#8211; soon we&#8217;ll have to face the responsibility of our wrongdoing.\n \nThe Major and Minor Prophets: The O.T. finishes up with madmen, each trying to outdo the last, in groveling, howling like wild dogs, shredding their sackcloth, rolling in ashes, soiling their straw beds. In short, these men reach the pinnacle of holiness. Each in turn bemoans and rails against people who are going about the business of living and prospering, a full-time job in my experience. Doom and gloom they say will be the result unless the heathens become as the prophets, which is nothing short of insanity. It pleases the Lord.\n\n Again, this only shows how we are affected by the Powers of Darkness. Satan was the Lord of the Air then and still is today, even though he cannot attack us as effectively as he did then. Faith carries us much further than knowledge does, when walking and talking in the spirit. But, back then, there was not the benefit of the Holy Spirit. I would have cried, scratched, wailed &#8211; whatever it took to get God&#8217;s message out. We are truly blessed these days in more ways than one.\n \nEye plucking: Yes, pluck it out. Go ahead, Jesus said so. Matthew 5:29. You don't need it anyway when you're praying with your eyelids shut, face skyward, hands folded, the perfect position of worthlessness to yourself and to others in need at this very moment. You won't see any pretty girls that way, whom have a way of kindling God's anger. His eyebrows become more corrugated with each new invention designed to simplify our lives.\n\n It&#8217;s the eye of the spirit-man He&#8217;s talking about<b></b>: Luke 11 : 34 The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness. Luke 11 : 35 Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness. Luke 11 : 36 If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.\n Now we have a mediator, one who stands in for us. So we can go to Him at any time and find that measure of offense, which is toward our souls, and do away with it &#8211; cast it into the sea of forgetfulness, never to be remembered again.\n \n Money: 1 Timothy 6:10 instructs us that the love of money is the root of all evil, and has become one of the most quoted lines of the Bible. It is better to my way of thinking to remember Ayn Rand's quote, \"Those who believe that money is the root of all evil would do well to ask themselves, 'what is the root of money?'\". The root of money, she explains, is freedom, and without it we are all at the mercy of the lash of the whip. With money comes the freedom necessary to pursue happiness.\n\n I can&#8217;t argue with you there. But, the love of money goes beyond that. I believe that that sort of love can bring much more sorrow than happiness. If a person loved money that much I doubt that they could ever feel comfortable without it&#8217;s constant influence &#8211; making it a god in some way, IMHO.\n \nHere's hoping you need never appeal to it, and that you find happiness (the most important thing in life, IMO) here and now.\n\n Same to you, billsco. It&#8217;s obvious that what appeals to us is different, but we are not&#8230;IMHO. :)",

   "Are the ethics espoused by Christianity the \"private property\" of the \"faithful\"?\n \n Is it impossible for an atheist to ever do the \"Christian\" thing?\n\n \n As faith without works is hollow, the reverse is true. To do good without reference to Christ is hollow.\n \n As a non-Christian you can do good things, but they are their own reward. These are what Orthodox say on the matter...\n \n \"Abraham was not justified by works, but by faith [Rom. 4:3]. Therefore, even if they do good works now, it is of no advantage to them after death, if they do not have faith. Clement of Alexandria (190 AD)Miscellanies bk. 1, chap. 7)\n \n \"When Scripture says, 'He will reward every man according to his works' (Matt. 16:27), do not imagine that works in themselves merit either hell or the Kingdom. On the contrary, Christ rewards each man according to whether his works are done with faith or without faith in Himself; and He is not a dealer bound by contract, but God our Creator and Redeemer. St. Mark the Ascetic.\n \n ...when the intellect forgets the purpose of a religious observance, the outward practice of virtue loses its value. For whatever is done indiscriminately and without purpose is not only of no benefit - even though good in itself - but actually does harm. St. John of Damaskos(On the Virtues and the Vices)\n \n ...without love the works of virtue are not praiseworthy or profitable to the man who practices them, and the same is true of love without works. St. Paul makes this fully clear with reference to works when he writes to the Corinthians, 'If I do this and that, but have no love, it profits me nothing' (cf. I Cor. 13:1-3); and with reference to love the disciple especially beloved by Christ writes, 'Let us not love in word or tongue but in action and truth' (I John 3:18). St. Gregory Palamas (Topics of Natural and Theological Science no. 58, The Philokalia Vol. 4 edited by Palmer, Sherrard and Ware; Faber and Faber pg.373)\n \n 2. For the method of godliness consists of these two things, pious doctrines, and virtuous practice: and neither are the doctrines acceptable to God apart from good works, nor does God accept the works which are not perfected with pious doctrines. Catechetical Lectures Of Our Holy Father, Cyril, Archbishop Of Jerusalem - Lecture Iv: On The Ten[1] Points Of Doctrine\n \n And just as tools without the workmen and the workmen without tools are unable to do anything, just so neither is faith without the fulfillment of the commandments, nor the fulfillment of the commandments without faith able to renew and re-create us, nor make us new men from the old. But, whenever we do possess both within a heart free of doubt, then we shall become the Master's vessels, be made fit for the reception of the spiritual myrrh. Then, too, will He Who makes darkness His hiding-place renew us by the gift of the Holy Spirit and raise us up new instead of old, and part the veil of His darkness and carry our mind away and allow it to peek as through some narrow opening, and grant it to see Him, still somehow dimly, and one might look on the disk of the sun or moon. It is then that the mind is taught -- or, put better -- knows and is initiated, and is assumed that that truly in no other way does one arrive at even partial participation in the ineffable good things of God except by way of the heart's humility, unwavering faith, and the resolve of the whole soul to renounce all the world and everything in it, together with one's own will, in order to keep all of God's commandments. St. Symeon the New Theologian, On the Mystical Life, Vol. I\n \n Every good deed we perform by our own natural powers, although it removes us further from the (evil deed) opposed to it, cannot make us holy without grace. St. Mark the Ascetic, \"Early Fathers From the Philokalia,\" trans. by E. Kadloubovsky and G.E.H. Palmer, (London: Faber and Faber, Ltd., 1981), pp. 86 - 90\n \n Every good work which we perform through our own natural power causes us to refrain from the corresponding sin; but without grace it cannot contribute to our sanctification. St. Mark the Ascetic, Philokalia, Vol. 1\n \n Fasts and vigils, the study of Scripture, renouncing possessions and everything worldly are not in themselves perfection, as we have said; they are its tools. For perfection is not to be found in them; it is acquired through them. It is useless, therefore, to boast of our fasting, vigils, poverty, and reading of Scripture when we have not achieved the love of God and our fellow men. Whoever has achieved love has God within himself and his intellect is always with God. St John Cassian\n \n Grace has been given mystically to those who have been baptized into Christ; and it becomes active within them to the extent that they actively observe the commandments. Grace never ceases to help us secretly; but to do good - as far as lies in our power - depends on us. St. Mark the Ascetic, Philokalia, Vol. 1\n \n He who does good and seeks a reward works not for God but for his own desire. St. Mark the Ascetic, \"Early Fathers From the Philokalia,\" trans. by E. Kadloubovsky and G.E.H. Palmer, (London: Faber and Faber, Ltd., 1981), pp. 86 - 90\n \n Knowledge without corresponding practice is still insecure, even if it is true. All is made firm by practice. St. Mark the Ascetic, \"Early Fathers From the Philokalia,\" trans. by E. Kadloubovsky and G.E.H. Palmer, (London: Faber and Faber, Ltd., 1981), pp. 86 - 90\n \n It was said about John the Little that one day he said to his older brother: I want to be free from care and not to work but to worship God without interruption. And he took his robe off, and went into the desert. After staying there one week, he returned to his brother. And when he knocked at the door, his brother asked without opening it: Who is it? He replied: It's John, your brother. The brother said: John has become an angel and is not among people anymore. Then he begged and said: It's me! But his brother did not open the door and left him there in distress until the next morning. And he finally opened the door and said: If you are a human being, you have to work again in order to live. Then John repented, saying: Forgive me, brother, for I was wrong. Sayings of the Desert Fathers\n \n On the Power and Influence of Good Deeds\n \n It is difficult, my brethren, to dispute with an atheist; it is difficult to converse with a stupid man; it is difficult to change an embittered man. It is only with the greatest difficulty that you will convince an atheist, a stupid man or an embittered man with words. Firstly, you must sway them by your deeds. They will come, \"by your good works, which they shall behold, to glorify God\" (I Pet. 2:12). Do good to him who would quarrel with you, and you will win the argument. A single act of compassion will penetrate to a stupid man and soften a bitter man more quickly than hours of discussion. If atheism and stupidity and bitterness proceed from ignorance, that ignorance is like a fury that is most easily bridled by the influence of good deeds. If you argue with an atheist on his own diabolical terms, you simply strengthen the demon of atheism. If you converse with a stupid man in a spirit of derision, the darkness of stupidity will be made the greater. If you think to change a bitter man by anger, you will merely add more fuel to the fire of bitterness. But a meek and well-intentioned act is like throwing water on the flames.\n \n Always remember the holy apostles and their behavior towards men. If an atheist challenges you, then it is not the man that challenges you but the devil, for man is by nature devout and tends Godwards. If a stupid man scoffs at you, then it is not the man who scoffs but the devil, for man is by nature intelligent. If a bitter man persecutes you, it is not the man that is doing this but the devil, for man is by nature good and well-disposed. It is the devil that challenges us in lengthy debates and fruitless discussions, but he flees from the power of good deeds. Do good in the name of Christ, and the devil will flee. You will be working with men, men who are devout and intelligent and good. Everything, therefore, that you do, be sure that you do it in the name of Christ. The Prologue from Ochrid: Lives of the Saints and Homilies for Every Day in the Year by Bishop Nikolai Velimirovic from the entry for June 30 (Vol. 2, p 380)\n \n Some think they believe rightly, while not practicing the commandments; others, while practicing them, expect the kingdom as a just reward. Both sin against truth. St. Mark the Ascetic, \"Early Fathers From the Philokalia,\" trans. by E. Kadloubovsky and G.E.H. Palmer, (London: Faber and Faber, Ltd., 1981), pp. 86 - 90\n \n The root of all good works is the hope of the Resurrection; for the expectation of the recompense nerves the soul to good works. For every laborer is ready to endure the toils, if he sees their reward in prospect; but when men weary themselves for nought, their heart soon sinks as well as their body. St. Cyril of Jerusalem (Catechetical Lectures: Lecture 18 no. 1)\n \n Whoever bears fruit with works of faith and love, he is a real disciple of Christ. REF:Saint John Chrysostom\n \n Every work which does not have love as its beginning and root, is nothing. REF:Saint John Chrysostom\n \n 51. When the intellect forgets the purpose of true devotion, then external works of virtue bring no profit. REF:Saint Kosmas Aitolos +1779\n \n Our deeds, dear sister, will not save us; God's infinite mercy will. Elder Amphilochios Makris - http://agrino.org/cyberdesert/makris.htm\n \n Whenever you wish to make a beginning in some good work, first prepare yourself for the temptations that will come upon you, and do not doubt the truth. St Isaac of Syria\n \n The Bible says faith without works is dead. The two go together.",

IMO, more people need to develop the habit of exploring and expanding their freedoms. This has been allowed to happen in the political arena on a broad, worldwide level, where the slow march toward egalitarianism has allowed each of us to stretch and exercize our ligaments. Sadly, the opposite occurs in the religious arena, and regardless of the name, or in whose name, or what setting, blinders and chains are handed out. We voluntarily put them on.\n \n Why do that? What is missing in your day to day life that leaves you unfulfilled? Life is good the way it is, it should be enough for any person. Can it be said spiritual people are being greedy by trying to reach for more than they can handle? When the bowl of holy mashed potatoes is passed around, aren't spiritual people being gluttons for heaping onto their plates more than they can eat? I lost my faith and have not felt the need to search for unsearchable things or grasp for the ungraspable since. What I need is right here in plain sight, and I couldn't or shouldn't ask for more.\n \n That's why I throw the baby, the water, the tub and Johnson's shampoo out the window.

It's what we may expect from someone who was raised to believe he will be going to hell for missing one service. So needy that he would rather close his eyes to pedophilia and continue to support the institution which made it possible, than take the simple steps necessary to stop it immediately. Religion, like smoking, is an artificial addiction, and there are no solutions or crutches to be found in secular institutions. Cold turkey, that's all.",

   "God doesn't want you happy, and the reason is simply this: It's bad for his business. \n \n IMO, the Bible can be viewed as God's various attempts to keep mankind miserable in this world here and now, and therefore treasuring the vague promise of the next world to come. Why people assume the next will be any better than the former is puzzling in itself, but to keep to my point of this thread consider:\n \n 1. The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil: In my estimation, the best thing man has ever done is reach for the apples, the ones whose flesh contained the magical lever which could be used to improve our station in life--knowledge. Without it, we would continue to blindly grope, ravaged by disease and hunger and ignorance, just as God had planned. This simple act so gummed up the works he had to hatch a New Plan, according to what the religionists would have us believe. \n \n 2. Onan: We learn in Genesis 38:9 that Onan spilled his seed upon the ground and the lesson religionists insist we learn from that is it is highly displeasing to God. After all, how can one be yearning for another world when heaven is at hand? Best to remain ill-adjusted, crimped and cramped, neurotic and crabby and heaven-bound than to experience the satisfaction of sexual excitement and release which leads to balanced, content individuals.\n \n 3. The Book of Lamentations: God so likes the business, he named a whole book after it. Enough said.\n \n 4. The Major and Minor Prophets: The O.T. finishes up with madmen, each trying to outdo the last, in groveling, howling like wild dogs, shredding their sackcloth, rolling in ashes, soiling their straw beds. In short, these men reach the pinnacle of holiness. Each in turn bemoans and rails against people who are going about the business of living and prospering, a full-time job in my experience. Doom and gloom they say will be the result unless the heathens become as the prophets, which is nothing short of insanity. It pleases the Lord.\n \n 5: Eye plucking: Yes, pluck it out. Go ahead, Jesus said so. Matthew 5:29. You don't need it anyway when you're praying with your eyelids shut, face skyward, hands folded, the perfect position of worthlessness to yourself and to others in need at this very moment. You won't see any pretty girls that way, whom have a way of kindling God's anger. His eyebrows become more corrugated with each new invention designed to simplify our lives.\n \n \n 6. Money: 1 Timothy 6:10 instructs us that the love of money is the root of all evil, and has become one of the most quoted lines of the Bible. It is better to my way of thinking to remember Ayn Rand's quote, \"Those who believe that money is the root of all evil would do well to ask themselves, 'what is the root of money?'\". The root of money, she explains, is freedom, and without it we are all at the mercy of the lash of the whip. With money comes the freedom necessary to pursue happiness.\n \n That's enough for now, I believe. I don't intend for the above to be all-inclusive, rather just to serve as examples of my contention that when people are prosperous and happy, it bodes ill for religion, which thrives on misfortune and pain and unhappiness. \n \n Here's hoping you need never appeal to it, and that you find happiness (the most important thing in life, IMO) here and now.\n\n \n \n Haven't read all the posts and don't really have time. One bit of logic,given that God is powerful, creator of all, then if he wanted us to be miserable, he could have come up with a way to make us miserable constantly. The world as we know it would not exist and we would live forever in eternal torment. That would have been a snap for God.\n \n However, if he wants us to love, truly love, of our own free will then, then that is the only explanation for the current situation. Unless of course you don't believe in GOd, but this question presumes the existence of God and therefore I answer accordingly.\n \n E.F.",

Drat!\n \nMy wife is watching Amish in the city (For entertainment) and she just loves how the Amish let their people go into the city for as long as they want, then they decide if they want to come back to the Amish community or be removed from it. Of course, the Amish throw in \"you'll go to hell if you don't return to the Amish\". Well I'll be!\n\n There must be a point to this? Can you also tell me what she watched last night too? I'd be (and note the sarcasm) really, really interested.\n \nHeck, just go Catholic, doesn't matter what you do, you can just be forgiven and it's all good. Right? Religion IS a consumer good, they are made and shaped by human wants/needs.\n\n Consumer good! Drat, found out again. That was point #43(b) of our next meeting.\n Hey, why don't you ask people what they believe, instead of telling them? Or put your questions in a more neutral way then saying all religious people believe such and such.",

   "As a non-Christian you can do good things, but they are their own reward.\n\n \nShouldn't that be all that's required? Do you need some sort of a reward in order to do good?\n\n I think the reward for doing something good is doing something good, but in Christ who is good.

   "Not sure how you miss points so easily.\n \n \nAs faith without works is hollow, the reverse is true. To do good without reference to Christ is hollow.\n\n \n To be good, lead a good life, or otherwise do anything without faith in your christian theology is \"hollow\"\n \n \n\"Abraham was not justified by works, but by faith [Rom. 4:3]. Therefore, even if they do good works now, it is of no advantage to them after death, if they do not have faith. Clement of Alexandria (190 AD)Miscellanies bk. 1, chap. 7)\n\n \n So your \"god\" looks at two people.\n Person A. leads a good life by both our definitions exluding anything religious. Helps people, selfless, compasionate, etc., etc.\n Person B. wants to kill people all the time, but does not, for fear of divinte retribution or a hellish afterlife. While quite the sociopath, this person does indeed have faith, and does not act on these impulses. While they don't lead a murdering life, they also don't lead a good life as above.\n \n So, your god thinks person B. is more worthy because of faith? Interesting.\n \n \n\"When Scripture says, 'He will reward every man according to his works' (Matt. 16:27), do not imagine that works in themselves merit either hell or the Kingdom. On the contrary, Christ rewards each man according to whether his works are done with faith or without faith in Himself; and He is not a dealer bound by contract, but God our Creator and Redeemer. St. Mark the Ascetic.\n\n \n Once again. This tells humans that they cannot be deemed \"worthy of reward\" unless they believe in your christian diety.\n \n \n...when the intellect forgets the purpose of a religious observance, the outward practice of virtue loses its value. For whatever is done indiscriminately and without purpose is not only of no benefit - even though good in itself - but actually does harm. St. John of Damaskos(On the Virtues and the Vices)\n\n When you do an act of good because you feel it's the right thing to do, it's not a good act. Actually, no, it says that such a \"good\" act actually does harm. That's good stuff you're posting, I'm starting to become a believer already.\n \n \n...without love the works of virtue are not praiseworthy or profitable to the man who practices them, and the same is true of love without works. St. Paul makes this fully clear with reference to works when he writes to the Corinthians, 'If I do this and that, but have no love, it profits me nothing' (cf. I Cor. 13:1-3); and with reference to love the disciple especially beloved by Christ writes, 'Let us not love in word or tongue but in action and truth' (I John 3:18). St. Gregory Palamas (Topics of Natural and Theological Science no. 58, The Philokalia Vol. 4 edited by Palmer, Sherrard and Ware; Faber and Faber pg.373)\n\n \n You can't love, you can't be praiseworthy or profitable if you don't believe in your christian stuff.\n \n \n2. For the method of godliness consists of these two things, pious doctrines, and virtuous practice: and neither are the doctrines acceptable to God apart from good works, nor does God accept the works which are not perfected with pious doctrines. Catechetical Lectures Of Our Holy Father, Cyril, Archbishop Of Jerusalem - Lecture Iv: On The Ten[1] Points Of Doctrine\n\n \n Well, this one actually seems to make sense. You can't be godly unless you believe in god. Well, good thing we're talking about GOOD and not godly, whatever godly means. I think godly must mean apathetic. You think otherwise? Explain.\n \n \n \nEvery good deed we perform by our own natural powers, although it removes us further from the (evil deed) opposed to it, cannot make us holy without grace. St. Mark the Ascetic, \"Early Fathers From the Philokalia,\" trans. by E. Kadloubovsky and G.E.H. Palmer, (London: Faber and Faber, Ltd., 1981), pp. 86 - 90\n\n \n Hmm. you reading what I'm reading? It seems that this is contradicting the others. You can be good, you just can't be holy. Well, I agree with that. Since I have no idea what \"holy\" means, nor does someones holiness seem to have an impact on the natural world.\n \n \n \nEvery good work which we perform through our own natural power causes us to refrain from the corresponding sin; but without grace it cannot contribute to our sanctification. St. Mark the Ascetic, Philokalia, Vol. 1\n\n Now I can't be sanctified if I don't have faith in your christian god either. OK, that's fine, sanctified is \"holy\", so I buy that too.\n \n \n \nFasts and vigils, the study of Scripture, renouncing possessions and everything worldly are not in themselves perfection, as we have said; they are its tools. For perfection is not to be found in them; it is acquired through them. It is useless, therefore, to boast of our fasting, vigils, poverty, and reading of Scripture when we have not achieved the love of God and our fellow men. Whoever has achieved love has God within himself and his intellect is always with God. St John Cassian\n\n \n It seems this one thinks doing good things is less important than love of santa claus..err..god.\n \n \nGrace has been given mystically to those who have been baptized into Christ; and it becomes active within them to the extent that they actively observe the commandments. Grace never ceases to help us secretly; but to do good - as far as lies in our power - depends on us. St. Mark the Ascetic, Philokalia, Vol. 1\n\n Holy moly. Grace was mystically given? Only those who are \"graced\" mystically can perform acts of good? OK, I disagree there, but it's religious dogma right? I can't disagree from what little I understand of this belief in things that have no proof nor ability to be incorrect.\n \n \nHe who does good and seeks a reward works not for God but for his own desire. St. Mark the Ascetic, \"Early Fathers From the Philokalia,\" trans. by E. Kadloubovsky and G.E.H. Palmer, (London: Faber and Faber, Ltd., 1981), pp. 86 - 90\n\n \n So if you do good for the love of god, or to please god, or to obey god's commandments, teachings, christ, or otherwise, you are not doing good for god? Is that a bit circular? Nonsense.\n \n \nKnowledge without corresponding practice is still insecure, even if it is true. All is made firm by practice. St. Mark the Ascetic, \"Early Fathers From the Philokalia,\" trans. by E. Kadloubovsky and G.E.H. Palmer, (London: Faber and Faber, Ltd., 1981), pp. 86 - 90\n\n Well, that's true. Buns are certainly made firm through practice.\n But as to truth, yes, I see your point. Here again, nothing can be TRUE unless they practice your christian faith. How convenient.\n \n \n \n \nAlways remember the holy apostles and their behavior towards men. If an atheist challenges you, then it is not the man that challenges you but the devil, for man is by nature devout and tends Godwards. If a stupid man scoffs at you, then it is not the man who scoffs but the devil, for man is by nature intelligent. If a bitter man persecutes you, it is not the man that is doing this but the devil, for man is by nature good and well-disposed. It is the devil that challenges us in lengthy debates and fruitless discussions, but he flees from the power of good deeds. Do good in the name of Christ, and the devil will flee. You will be working with men, men who are devout and intelligent and good. Everything, therefore, that you do, be sure that you do it in the name of Christ. The Prologue from Ochrid: Lives of the Saints and Homilies for Every Day in the Year by Bishop Nikolai Velimirovic from the entry for June 30 (Vol. 2, p 380)\n\n One of the few long ones I'll copy. This is a really good one too.\n So, if someone debates you who is not of the \"faith\", then they are the devil. Hm. You see a trend here?\n \n \nSome think they believe rightly, while not practicing the commandments; others, while practicing them, expect the kingdom as a just reward. Both sin against truth. St. Mark the Ascetic, \"Early Fathers From the Philokalia,\" trans. by E. Kadloubovsky and G.E.H. Palmer, (London: Faber and Faber, Ltd., 1981), pp. 86 - 90\n\n That's confusing. If you so much as THINK you're getting into heaven, you're sinning. Funny. I think we can spot a few sinners according to this little gem.\n \n \nThe root of all good works is the hope of the Resurrection; for the expectation of the recompense nerves the soul to good works. For every laborer is ready to endure the toils, if he sees their reward in prospect; but when men weary themselves for nought, their heart soon sinks as well as their body. St. Cyril of Jerusalem (Catechetical Lectures: Lecture 18 no. 1)\n\n So now good depends on hoping for the ressurection, which I think means faith. Yes, yes, all good is possible only when you believe in your christian god.\n \n \n \nOur deeds, dear sister, will not save us; God's infinite mercy will. Elder Amphilochios Makris - http://agrino.org/cyberdesert/makris.htm\n\n \n What does this mean? Must be some figurative of the word \"Save\", because I'm pretty sure I read in the newspaper yesterday that a young boy \"saved\" another handicapped boy by diving into the water and dragging him out. I think his \"deed\" save the kid, but what do I know. It must have been that infinite mercy? Explain.\n ==============================\n \n So yes, it's not a conspiracy, that's your wording, not mine. It's as plain as day, there is no hidden meaning. The religion you refer to teaches that you cannot be good, unless you have faith, regardless of your actions or intentions. And yes, I think that's quite convenient.\n \n If you don't have faith in your christianity, you CANNOT do good, if you don't believe in god you are the devil, and you aren't going to the \"kingdom of heaven\" unless you join our bandwagon. Yes, I think that smacks of human ingenuity. And I think quite the opposite of all of that. You certainly don't need to believe in XYZ to be or do good. The term devil has no more basis in reality than the tooth fairy, nothing we know (or ever will know?) suggests there is a grand kingdom awaiting after death. Nice thought, but all based on teachings written by humans (mostly men).\n \n So, you did all the work for me with those quotes (seriously, that's a lot of work). The general theme is that one cannot lead a good life unless one believes in your specifically described christian teachings. So why bother debating? One cannot disagree with such a religion according to it's teachings, so you might as well stop trying to defend it. It needs no defending through words because it's not based on something intended to be flexible or reasoned through. Besides, you label me as the devil, I don't know how you get past that to have a reasonable discussion anyway. That worries me, please don't get any thoughts about vanquishing the devil...I'd take offense to that.\n \n I liked Kronus's less antagonistic approach, yet you bashed him with irrationality too.\n \n -Mach",

Can such faith save him?\n You're not saved BY works. But if you just sit around going \"I have faith\" then you won't be saved either. Secondly you bring in a logical flaw with the sola fide dogma that my church has nothing to do with. Sola fide or faith alone holds that all you need is 'faith' and not works. My church, the Orthodox Church and the Catholics, and some others don't ascribe to this relatively recent innovation. Your debunking of it is a succinct re-working of James Hogg's classic rebuttal of sola fide in his book \"Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner\", so in short\n a) it's not a theory I ascribe to, therefore I don't see a need to defend it\n and\n b) it's been debunked well enough, so I don't see a reason to attack it.\n \nWhat does this mean?

   "Egalitarian cultures like to think their religious practices are more enlightened, that's all the farther I'll go with it. In practice, religion is repressive in its very nature, IMO, and amounts to putting various shades of lipstick on a pig. \n\n I don't know what you mean by \"enlightened\". Egalitarian is egalitarian, so if by \"repressive\" you mean self-repression, you'll have to be more specific. After all, egalitarian pagan religions did/do not necessarily include dogmatic restrictions on behavior, sexuality, expression, etc. \n \n As for the pig, some would say it depends on what \"season\" they are, but I say whatever color the pig prefers... \n \n \nSmoking fulfills a need in some people.

In this case it is, but for example with alcolhol a glass of wine at dinner every day is actually good for the health, but not if you're alcoholic.\n \n \nIf one is trying to show another the road to truth, it does no good to give them detours. Likewise, if one is pointing out to another the fact that they are on the wrong road, it isn't incumbent upon them to show the other what road is the right one.\n\n Religion is largely a personal decision. People aren't generally very open to being \"shown the right road\". Just as it is possible to be a good person without religion, it is possible to be a good person with religion. \n \n \nSo needy that he would rather close his eyes to pedophilia and continue to support the institution which made it possible, than take the simple steps necessary to stop it immediately. Religion, like smoking, is an artificial addiction, and there are no solutions or crutches to be found in secular institutions. Cold turkey, that's all.\n\n You cannot possibly know what would be the best solution for every person who wants an alternative way to have their needs fulfilled. Neither is needing community acceptance an \"artificial addiction\", but a probably universal psychological need. There is a dearth of secular gathering-places where people can socialize, get support on personal issues, gossip, and feel welcome. \n \n You don't seem to be making any effort to understand why ppl are drawn to religion. Your message sounds to me like Nancy Reagan's \"Just Say No\" Anti-drug campaign- it didn't work then, and I doubt it will work now. People are much more complicated than that.
