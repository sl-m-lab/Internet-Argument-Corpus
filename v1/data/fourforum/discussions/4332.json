   "When does a fetus become a baby?\n \n At 12 weeks when it can move it's legs and arms?\n \n At 20 weeks when the cerebral cortex (the center of the brain that allows for conciousness) begins to develop?\n \n At 22 weeks when it has a 25-50 % chance of survival outside the womb with numerous medical interventions? \n \n At 24 weeks when it has a 50-75% chance of living outside the womb and inside the womb will respond to it's moters voice and extrenal touch?\n \n At 28 weeks when it has a 75+% chance of survival with moderate medical interventions and is able to see?\n \n At 34 weeks when it has fully developed lungs and has almost the same chance of survival at a full term fetus?\n \n Is it at birth whatever age it is?\n \n Or at conception?\n \n Or some other time all together????\n \n When a soul enters the body?

   "When does a fetus become a baby?\n\n As I mentioned in other threads, I believe that a fetus starts to become a person around the beginning of the third trimester, when the brain is sufficiently developed to allow for a mind (i.e. rudimentary thoughts and emotions). To me, having a mind (or, if you prefer, in religious terms, soul) is the most important aspect of \"personhood\".\n \n To support my belief that the \"mind\" doesn't start until around the beginning of the third trimester, I am attaching this quote from an article by Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan named \"Abortion: Is it Possible to be both \"Pro-life\" and \"Pro-Choice\"?\" from page 4 of the link: http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml\n \n\n Thinking occurs, of course, in the brain--principally in the top layers of the convoluted \"gray matter\" called the cerebral cortex. The roughly 100 billion neurons in the brain constitute the material basis of thought. The neurons are connected to each other, and their linkups play a major role in what we experience as thinking. But large-scale linking up of neurons doesn't begin until the 24th to 27th week of pregnancy--the sixth month. \n \n By placing harmless electrodes on a subject's head, scientists can measure the electrical activity produced by the network of neurons inside the skull. Different kinds of mental activity show different kinds of brain waves. But brain waves with regular patterns typical of adult human brains do not appear in the fetus until about the 30th week of pregnancy--near the beginning of the third trimester. Fetuses younger than this--however alive and active they may be--lack the necessary brain architecture. They cannot yet think. \n \n\n Of course, one could debate the level of mind necessary to define a person, but I don't think I have ever heard the term \"person\" used in a context that does not automatically assume some level of \"mind\", be it even a simple sense of self.",

Why limit yourself to the extreme views? \n \n I do not believe that the original post asked for an absolute answer, just a survey of opinions. After all, as you say, abortion is not math and there is no one answer that everyone might agree with. However, the question of people's opinions on the beginning of personhood and how it relates to the morality of abortion lies at the very core of the debate on abortion rights.

There are also views that are rational but not based on a scientific basis, such as purely religious or philosophical views that are at least well thought out and self-consistent. These views may be fine for the people who hold them, but I would be against any such views being imposed through laws on the rest of the public since, after all, we have a separation of church and state.

But, not all emotionally based reasons are useless. After all, pretty much everyone acknowledges that murder of innocent born people is bad - are they basing this purely on emotional reasons? If so, then most of our laws and, indeed, most of the basis of our civilization is based on emotional arguements. Why shouldn't the strong be able to steal from the weak? Why shouldn't people torture others and enjoy it? All of the laws which protect us from such arguments are based, in some way, on emotion. Does that make them wrong?

It's not latched into the mother.\n \n The Baby, even AFTER birth, isn't completely worthy of Rights. Children aren't completely worth of rights either. The degree of rights is determined by age, level of autonomy, and level of sapience/sentience. It's not an on/off thing or black and white.\n \n \n Blanket statements like \"there are no other valid criteria\" are patently untrue until you have discredited, or at least attempted to discredit, all other criteria. You have not done this, you have only attempted to support your own personal criteria.\n Quote:\n\n \n There are no other criteria offered by Ethicists, ergo, there's nothing else to discuss.\n \n Relgions are irrelevant, so that blows the only counter to them. What other criteria are there? I haven't heard any debated in journals, articles. ONly the above.\n \n \n This statement is either a sign of depression on your part or a statement that makes any and all life ethically okay to end in any situation.\n\n \n I am not depressed. I just don't care about life as my top priority in every scenario. The fact that something is alive does not give it a right to life. The fact that life exists does not mean it's sacred or that it cannot be taken away.\n \n Lives are neutral. It's neither wrong nor good to kill. The value of the statement comes from the consequences and the context.\n \n \n \n \n What on earth does that mean?\n\n \n Human life isn't valuable because it is human. THere are other qualities to human life that are valuable. It doesn't matter that you are human why it's wrong to kill other humans. Humans, as a fetus of early stages is on the same level of competency, autonomy, and IQ as other mammals. There is no logical reason to choose a human fetus over a dog fetus at the same stage untill either of them reach the stage in which they would have the above critera. At that general point, the Human takes precedence, especially as it gets older, because it obviously is more valuable due to intelligence, autonomy, IQ. It becomes useful to society and to the individual.\n \n The emotional response is that Humans are valuable because they are intrinsically valuable; they aren't. Nothing is, and it's purely emotive attatchment why someone would pick a fetus human over a bonobo fetus to kill.\n \n Killing nor species are the criteria. \n \n \n \n No one here, at least not me or anyone else I see, has made any argument regarding religion, so how about we stick to the arguments at hand.\n\n \n It has been mentioned before, and it's to prevent it from being mentioned again.

   "That still doesn't make any sense. Would you agree that it is possible to be killed instantly. If so, then it is possible at any age to die without warning, fear, or sense of whats happening. So then this would mean that it is okay to commit murder under these circumstances?\n\n I think you are taking my view that the fetus \"wouldn't know the difference\" too literally. I use that term more from the sense of hypothetically observing myself having this abortion done to me as a third-trimester fetus, and seeing that, before abortion, I was a mentally existing being and, after abortion, that mentally existing being is no more. For abortions before the third trimester, that is not the case since there is no mentally existing being to be aborted. By mentally existing, I imply that the mind is developed enough to at least have a sense of self, and preferably at least rudimentary, though not necessarily conscious, thoughts and emotions.\n \n What then is YOUR view of the beginning of personhood?

They are moral persons, but they are moral persons with slightly less autonomy. Being separate isn't the primary thing that makes a moral person, so you are right.\n \n \n Unlike born Siamese twins, the fetus is, for the most time, a growing parasitic mass.

Do you define a being as a person either if the being is autonomous OR if it has sufficient value, but not if it lacks both these qualities?\n\n \n When I say autonomous, I am basically meaning that you aren't someone living inside of someone else, while at the same time not being sentient/sapient. As long as the baby is outside of the mother and not living off of her body, i wouldn't support killing it any more than I would support killing a frog or a dog. There's no reason to end the life of another being unless you have to if it is not acting like a body-parasite or hurting you. Euthanasia is different concern though.\n \n If the being lacks both of those qualities, the it has no real value, unless it's already become a person with those qualities and has to undergo temporary dependance (someone is a coma that is not persistant vegetative state). As long as you have the money, I wouldn't be against keeping the person alive.\n \n If a being is not autonomous in the sense that it's living inside of you and has no intelligence or sapience and sentience, then I don't think you should be forced to keep a mindless thing inside of you.\n \n sufficient value bascially hinges on level of mental development and autonomy. If you have no autonomy, you most likely won't have much value. For example: A person in a persistant vegetative state is technically an autonomous person, but that autonomy has been taken away. It cannot think, or act, or move or respond to friends and family. It just sits there. You get no value out of it. It's like being dead.\n \n When a baby is no longer in your body, it isn't yours to kill. You cannot kill one Siamese twin if you are attached because it most likely will harm the both of you, unless a doctor does it. IN that case, pepole do get separations, even if it kills one of them.

   "Sufficient value bascially hinges on level of mental development and autonomy. If you have no autonomy, you most likely won't have much value. For example: A person in a persistant vegetative state is technically an autonomous person, but that autonomy has been taken away. It cannot think, or act, or move or respond to friends and family. It just sits there. You get no value out of it. It's like being dead.\n\n By \"vegetative state\", do you include those who may be in a permanent or long-term state of unconsciousness?

Here is Section IX (references removed for ease of reading):\n \n http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&navby=case&vol=410&invol=113\n The Constitution does not define \"person\" in so many words. Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains three references to \"person.\" The first, in defining \"citizens,\" speaks of \"persons born or naturalized in the United States.\" The word also appears both in the Due Process Clause and in the Equal Protection Clause. \"Person\" is used in other places in the Constitution:...But in nearly all these instances, the use of the word is such that it has application only postnatally. None indicates, with any assurance, that it has any possible pre-natal application. \n All this, together with our observation, supra, that throughout the major portion of the 19th century prevailing legal abortion practices were far freer than they are today, persuades us that the word \"person,\" as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn. This is in accord with the results reached in those few cases where the issue has been squarely presented. Indeed, our decision in United States v. Vuitch, inferentially is to the same effect, for we there would not have indulged in statutory interpretation favorable to abortion in specified circumstances if the necessary consequence was the termination of life entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection. \n \n They base their decision on the US Constitution, and then confirms it through other rulings.\n \nI get the impression from your arguements that you think that I am fully pro-life.\nNot at all. I am merely responding to your post.

I have no problems with abortions being done in the first and second trimester. This makes me pro-choice in the first and second trimester (when almost all abortions happen) and pro-life in the third trimester (where a tiny fraction of the abortions happen).\nWell enough. I still have some problems with \"sufficiently a person,\" though.\n That aside, does a person have \"the right to life\" that allows them to use another person's body for their survival, particularly if that other person expressedly refuse such use? That really is the issue. Can a person's body be used against their consent if it is to save another person? So far the result is a resounding no. You can let a person bleed to death in front of you without ever being compelled to give any of your blood, f.ex.\nJust because it is only a small fraction of abortions that are done in the third trimester does not mean that its lawfulness should not be an issue.\nEven as they are exclusively or near-exclusively for the health and safety of the woman, ie. Done per medical recommendation? Because certainly, carrying a pregnancy for 26-28 weeks and then decides on a whim that they don't want to be pregnant anymore is not making much sense. So how realistic is that?\nFirst of all, if we do agree that a late term fetus is a person,\nWe don't, actually. Person is a legal term and its application begins at birth.\nthen shouldn't we agree that it should have protections against abortions?\nSuch as? Could you give an example of the kind of 3rd trimester abortions that occur when they shouldn't? Remember that only 1.4% of all abortions happen at or after 21 weeks, months before 3rd trimester \nApparently over 80% of Americans do think that third term abortions should be outlawed in general.\nActually, what they disagree with is the fictitious events that prolife propagandists have portrayed, none of which are founded in reality. So are you for legislation against what doesn't occur to begin with, and which will result in legislation that murkies the picture for medically necessary abortions? Why do you seek a political imposition on a medical decision? Are you at all suggesting that other medical procedures be regulated similarly, based on maybes and what-ifs of political propagandists? If not, why singling out pregnant women for such discrimination?\nAlso, the pro-life camp often shows pictures of abortions of late term fetuses to rally people to its cause - disingenuous since almost all abortions are done before the third term (just under 90% before the second term).

That really is the issue. Can a person's body be used against their consent if it is to save another person? So far the result is a resounding no. \nParents and legal guardians are considered criminally liable for negligence if they do not sufficiently care for the children that are their dependents. I have even heard of successful lawsuits being imposed on bistanders who let someone die but who could have taken action to save that life. Yes, neither of these examples involve others being within the physical body of the person, but certainly show that people are required by law to have certain responsibilities over others, independent of their will. The case of abortion is almost unique since, apart from the case of Siamese twins, no other situation that I can think of requires one person to support another who is connected or part of their body. Once the fetus is sufficiently developed, there are two minds involved, not just one. One has to weigh the rights of the mother choosing to end a pregnancy with that of the late fetus which also has a right not to die. Even Roe vs. Wade allows for states to outlaw abortion in the third trimester - their reasoning is that, in the third trimester, the fetus could be viable. About 66% of Americans believe that abortion should be legal in the first trimester. However, 84% of Americans believe that abortions should generally be illegal in the third trimester (from a CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll which I found on the web site http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm). This is far from \"a resounding no\". \n \nSo are you for legislation against what doesn't occur to begin with, and which will result in legislation that murkies the picture for medically necessary abortions? Why do you seek a political imposition on a medical decision? Are you at all suggesting that other medical procedures be regulated similarly, based on maybes and what-ifs of political propagandists? If not, why singling out pregnant women for such discrimination?\nI, and the great majority of Americans, allow for abortions at any stage if the mother's life is at risk. For me, if two people's lives are at stake, I would give preference to the life of the mother over that of the late term fetus. Of course I don't think that other medical procedures should have similar regulation. I don't know how you think my arguements are at all applicable to medical procedures unrelated to abortion - when no other person is involved. \n \nWhy do you allow them to define the issue through outright lies? Why should we cave to liars, thus putting women at risk when they have a medical need for an abortion, just because it doesn't happen till third trimester? I must admit that I have a lot more concern for the woman patient than the prolife liar.\nI think we both know how hard it is to control the rationality of the staunchest pro-life protesters. But even most pro-life supporters would allow for abortion when medically necessary to prevent a severe threat to the mother's life. Yes, the number of women who have abortions in the third term (particularly those that are not related to a threat on the mother's life) is very tiny - you do not need to keep repeating that fact over and over and over.

To talk about it being \"dangerously unstable\" is simply silly hyperbole.\n \n Even the Constitution is changeable by political means, so your claim is really not relevant. ****ALL**** laws are changeable through political means. heck, they are changeable through revolutions and global natural disasters as well. Such out-there what-ifs are not realistic. Yes, who knows if gravity someday is reversed as well. To claim that because all laws can be changed, abortion is obsolete, or whatever it is you are pushing here, is rather silly.\n \n To argue that the personhood issue is dangerously unstable because it is only a law and not an edict set in stone, is silly and borders on being outright dishonest.\nParents and legal guardians are considered criminally liable for negligence if they do not sufficiently care for the children that are their dependents.\nAnd guess what, these kids are persons.

People who agree to take on duties have a duty to fulfill them, that's all your examples show. And that certainly is irrelevant to the woman with an unwanted pregnancy who does NOT agree to let her body be used. Once again, prolife arguments are way off target, far removed from that reality.\n \nThe case of abortion is almost unique since, apart from the case of Siamese twins, no other situation that I can think of requires one person to support another who is connected or part of their body.\nWell, neither does abortion, so rather the Siamese twins situation is not related to anything else, including that of abortion. The embryo or fetus is not a person. Once it is, you can come running with your analogies. Until then, they are irrelevant signs of prolife grasping for straws in their realization that reality does not support their wishful thinking.\n \nOnce the fetus is sufficiently developed, there are two minds involved, not just one.\n\"Sufficiently developed\"? What a wonderful fudge term. And certainly irrelevant to the issue of abortions in general.\n Even if it had a mind, so what? Even PERSONS with a mind doesn't have the right to use a person's body against that person's will. Prolifers simply haven't realized yet that the status of the fetus actually is irrelevant.\n \nOne has to weigh the rights of the mother choosing to end a pregnancy with that of the late fetus which also has a right not to die.\nIt has no such right, prolife hyperbole none withstanding. And again, \"late term\" fetuses are aborted during medical emergencies. If you claim otherwise, please provide the proof. You said 30-32 weeks, right? SO please demonstrate this non-medically-indicated 30-week abortion. I am not holding my breath for the evidence.\n \nEven Roe vs. Wade allows for states to outlaw abortion in the third trimester - their reasoning is that, in the third trimester, the fetus could be viable.\nAnd states have done so, with the exceptions of the health of the woman. So this brand new restriction on women, guess what, it is already there. So what exactly is your point here?\n \nAbout 66% of Americans believe that abortion should be legal in the first trimester. However, 84% of Americans believe that abortions should generally be illegal in the third trimester. This is far from \"a resounding no\".\nIrrelevant. Do Americans want to be forced to give of their bodily resources against their will? Until you show me that affirmative poll, the US Supreme Court will drop the rest of the nonsense prolife chicanery.\n \nI, and the great majority of Americans, allow for abortions at any stage if the mother's life is at risk. For me, if two people's lives are at stake, I would give preference to the life of the mother over that of the late term fetus.\nThat's nice of you. Some prolifers are so radical that they see it otherwise. AT least you are not one of them.\n \nOf course I don't think that other medical procedures should have similar regulation.\nNo, I noticed that bias.\n \n I don't know how you think my arguements are at all applicable to medical procedures unrelated to abortion - when no other person is involved.\nFascinating, so in other surgeries, the patient is not a person? \n Your hyperbole aside, no the fetus is not a person, and as such, your reasoning for trying to distinguish between these surgeries is outright bogus. It is emotional rhetoric and anti-choice revisionist linguistics. Again, **WHEN** the fetus is a person, you can make that argument. Until then, it is merely anti-choice fiction and wishful thinking, misrepresented as \"reality.\" \n \nI think we both know how hard it is to control the rationality of the staunchest pro-life protesters.\nFunny enough, their organizations have the ear of the republican party. Until you sweep out that scourge, you are guilty of ignoring them and thus of polarizing the abortion debate to the point where no compromises are made and thus no changes occurs.\n \nBut even most pro-life supporters would allow for abortion when medically necessary to prevent a severe threat to the mother's life.\nBut not a less severe threat to her life? And not to maiming injuries and illnesses where she won't die, then? Or where you merely ratcheting up the hyperbole? What about the illnesses that are so severe that the woman has to go on disability afterwards, f.ex.? How many prolifers would stand by and allow that?\n Perhaps you need to monitor your pronouns a bit.\n \n Yes, the number of women who have abortions in the third term (particularly those that are not related to a threat on the mother's life) is very tiny - you do not need to keep repeating that fact over and over and over.\nWell, you keep insisting that such actually exist. Where is the evidence? Your beliefs and wishful thinking certainly doesn't make it so.\n \nI simply think that fact is irrelevant if the law would be just.\nIf the law would be just, it would impose no more burden on the woman's body than it does on any other person, which is no burden at all to sustain other life against one's wishes.

   "But is enough to establish that its function, its individuality is no different than that of an organ.\nAn organ has generally one specific function, a fetus has most of the same functions near the end of term as do we - far from being equatable with an organ. \n \nCareful about the \"late term\" descriptor, it is never certain exactly what you mean. Some prolifers try to make \"late term\" be anything other than 1st trimester. \n As I've already mentioned in a previous post, I do not believe that a mind begins before roughly the 30th week.\nAnd again, try for a law that ends up harming those who seek a legal, medically needed abortion in 3rd trimester just because of some paranoid idea of even remotely significant number of non-medical abortions in 3rd trimester shows callousness towards the women who need these procedures. You know full well that the moment your desired ban takes effect, prolife radicals will try to expand it.\nThis is a discussion forum about abortion where one of the goals, at least in my mind, is to find some common ground. I am not going to lie about my views out of paranoia about the pro-life proponents. If a law generally outlawing abortion (except for threats to the mothers life) becomes fact and the pro-life proponents then try to outlaw all abortions in the third trimester, including those to save the mothers life (unlikely, since most of them also support the mother's life exception), then I will fight against that change. I will believe and argue views based on their value, not on fear of the slippery slope.\n \n So until your side brings your radicals under control and completely marginalize them, such an idea won't even be entertained as it will end up killing women. So you can forget that idea.\nWhat exactly are you calling my side?! I am and have always been pro-choice, have contributed to NARAL, and argued to keep most abortions legal. As I have stated in previous posts, I believe that abortion should be fully legal in the first and second trimester (when almost all abortions happen) and simply not for general reasons in the third trimester. Since 84% of Americans apparently believe that third trimester abortions should be generally illegal, then my stance is actually in the majority of the pro-choice views and yours is in the minority. Be careful how you label people.\n \nThe potential is not the actual. We have a bunch of proverbs to that extend -don't count your chicken before they hatch. Don't sell the skin before the bear is shot. And so on. An aborted fetus also will never become a person, so your point is moot.\nI used that as one of the arguments to show the falacy of your assertion that a fetus is merely like an organ. \n \nExcept that it likely would be found unconstitutional as applied to abortions, so that settles that.\nThe Roe vs. Wade text stated that the Constitution did not clearly define the term person and that the only places where a definition of personhood was implied was in a few ammendments. We have seen often enough in our history that one ammendment can cancel or change another. So, your certainty in the stability of a Constitutional base of personhood is unfounded.\n \nAnd that would then be true with all definitions. To talk about it being \"dangerously unstable\" is simply silly hyperbole.\n\n Wrong. The great majority of definitions in our language are stable. Part of the trouble with the whole abortion debate is that we as a culture have never fully resolved a definition of personhood. That is why, in this thread, we are doing our part to try to debate such a definition. \n \nEven the Constitution is changeable by political means, so your claim is really not relevant. ****ALL**** laws are changeable through political means. heck, they are changeable through revolutions and global natural disasters as well. Such out-there what-ifs are not realistic. Yes, who knows if gravity someday is reversed as well. To claim that because all laws can be changed, abortion is obsolete, or whatever it is you are pushing here, is rather silly.\nYou seem to be missing the point. The point of this thread was to discuss what we view as a definition of personhood. One of the goals (perhaps unreachable) would be to find a fixed and stable definition, just like we have a fixed definition for a table, or a cat, or a river. I simply stated that a legal definition is not stable and, therefore, in trying to come up with a general fixed definition of personhood, one cannot say - the currently legal definition - since that can change. As to your last sentences, thay are irrelavant to anything that I have said in my posts. \n \n I've noticed that,in this post, you seem to find a need to be belligerent in your responses and it shows up in the irrelavancy of many of your points to the things I've said in my posts. For example, despite my stating the contrary, you seem to be attaching all sorts of pro-life views to me that I have never stated. I would urge you to calm down before you post. I would be happy to continue our discussion, as long as it remains civil and rational. If you choose to be belligerent, then I will simply stop replying to your posts. After all, if a discussion cannot remain civil and rational then it is not worth having. \n \n To be honest, looking now at the rest of your post, its belligerence has turned me off to even responding. I have already made my point that I believe that a late term (post-30th week) fetus is a person (since it can start having a mind) who's rights to life should be respected by generally outlawing abortion and that I, like almost everyone on either side, believe that an exception should be made for a threat to the life of the mother.",

   "No, murder is the illegal killing of a person. Abortion is not illegal and the fetus is not a person.\n\n \n Wrong. I don't know how you follow that logic. The act of murder is illegal, so you can't say that it is the illegal killing of someone. It's like saying robbery is the illegal stealing of something. Stealing itself it illegal. Killing another human being is illegal, but murder (as opposed to other forms of killing, such as manslaughter) is one aspect of killing which is punished differently. The ONLY time killing is not illegal is when it is committed in self defense.\n \n \n\n See above. Because it is human life does in no way hurts the pro-choice argument.

Biblical definitions are not valid in a legal argument.\n\n \n I don't believe that you are just out to protect the law, because if abortion was made illegal, would you defend that law as well?\n \n Yes, there are many reasons where killing a human life is justafiable, but that doesn't mean that it is moral or legal. Justifiable is a word that can only be defined by the individual. For some people, the death penalty is justifiable. For others, it is not. Using the word \"justifiable\" cannot be backed up.

What in the heck do you abortionists think that sex is really all about?

Time to take responsibility for ones actions....have sex and get pregnant then take care of your child. Why does a dad have to give up his resources for the child with child support? That doesn't seem fair...maybe they didnt want the kid...does that give them the right to not take care of it?",

   "Wrong. I don't know how you follow that logic. The act of murder is illegal, so you can't say that it is the illegal killing of someone.\nSure we can.

It's like saying robbery is the illegal stealing of something. Stealing itself it illegal. Killing another human being is illegal, but murder (as opposed to other forms of killing, such as manslaughter) is one aspect of killing which is punished differently. The ONLY time killing is not illegal is when it is committed in self defense.\n\n \n The legal definition of murder is \"The illegal killing of a person\". I didn't make it up.\n \n \n\n I don't believe that you are just out to protect the law, because if abortion was made illegal, would you defend that law as well?\n\n \n I don't believe I said I was out to protect the law. If abortion was made illegal, I would believe that law to be contrary to our Constitutional rights.\n \n \n\n Yes, there are many reasons where killing a human life is justafiable, but that doesn't mean that it is moral or legal. Justifiable is a word that can only be defined by the individual. For some people, the death penalty is justifiable. For others, it is not. Using the word \"justifiable\" cannot be backed up. Try again.\n\n \n Agreed, what is \"justifiable\" for one person is not necessarily \"justified\" for another person. Along those same lines \"unjustified\" for one person is not necessarily \"unjustified\" for another. That you believe abortion is \"unjustified\" is meaningless to those of us who believe it is \"justified\".\n \n The same thing with \"moral\". What is \"moral\" for me may be \"immoral\" to you. \"Moral\" cannot be backed up. Given that abortion is legal, and neither \"moral\" nor \"justified\" can be backed up, what is your problem?\n \n \n\n You're right, but the choice for adoption can affect whether the fetus is aborted or carried. So, in reality, it is too closely linked to preganacy for you to plug up your ears to the fact that it usually is a deciding factor in abortion.\n\n \n I don't believe adoption is the deciding factor of abortion. Regardless, however, they are separate issues and saying that a pregnant woman has the option of adoption is dishonest given the circumstances of pregnancy.\n \n \n\n That is one of the poorest arguments I've ever heard. No, of course you don't consent to a bus hitting you if you cross the street. You know what you DO do? You look both ways, so there is no possibility of being hit the first place. You know how that relates to pregnancy? Abstinence or condoms.\n\n \n Abstinence or condoms work to prevent pregnancy, this is true. Looking both ways does the same thing for the bus. Guess what? People can still be hit by a bus even after doing every possible thing to avoid it. If this happens, do the paramedics say \"You have to accept the consequences of your actions. We will not help\"? \n \n How about another analogy, hm? Lets say you get smashed and come home, unlock your door and go to bed. However, you irresponsibly left your keys in the door; in fact you left your door slightly ajar. You might as well invite a burglar in! If someone comes in your house and you call the police do they say \"You have to accept the consequences of your own irresponsible actions. We will not help\"?\n \n \n\n Most women are smart enough to know that they have a high risk of getting pregnant through sex. What in the heck do you abortionists think that sex is really all about?\n\n \n ...\n \"Abortionist\"? Exactly what is that?\n \n \"think that sex is really all about\"? Is there a manual? Was there a test? I wasn't aware that we have started legislating the proper way to have sex.\n \n \n\n So that you can have sexual release, so that you can enjoy the pleasure of it, so that you can make your relationship more intimate? No! You might want to sit down, because this could suprise you. The purpose of sex IS TO HAVE CHILDREN! emoticon_idea So, if a girl consents to sex, she consents the the possibility of having children!\n\n \n No. There was no contract in which she signed over her body to the gov't when she had sex. \"The purpose of sex\" is your own personal moral, and the gov't is not in the business of enforcing morals. That is theism, or fascism. The gov't has no business violating women's rights, even to ensure the survival of another.\n \n This may surprise you, but there are some who believe that a woman should not enter motherhood soley because she has no other choice. It may surprise you that some women may not want to provide complete organ support for the zygote, embryo or fetus for 9 months.\n \n Yes, sometimes two people have sex irresponsibly. However, pregnancy and motherhood should not be used as punishment for irresponsible behavior. It should always be a choice.",

You certainly are able to legally kill other people, so your argument is nonsense.\n \n\n \n Nope. Do you think that there would be a difference between a cop shooting a bank robber and a civillian shooting a bank robber? Yep, the civillian would be charged. Civillians aren't allowed to carry automatic weapons, however police and military can. Understand that the government can take certain liberty's with the law when it comes to saftey and expense.\n \n \n\n REALLY? But up above, you specifically stated that: \"Killing another human being is illegal.\" So it seems that you contradict your own claims.\n\n \n Yes, it does seem that way. But if you knew anything about law whatsoever, you would know that anyone activly infringing on other's rights gives up any rights they have. Once they are no longer endangering others, then they regain their rights. That's why police aren't allowed to shoot once a criminal has surrendered.\n \n \nAs it would violate the US Constitution, as the US Supreme Court has shown, it would not be a legal law anyway.\n\n \n The Supreme Court also said that \"seperate but equal\" was Constitutional as well, but you don't see that anymore...\n \n Think about this.

You have evidence for that claim, that it \"usually is a deciding factor in abortion\"? Please show us the research that documents this.\n\n \n Considering that I work at a crisis pregnancy center, I guess my opinion doesn't matter, does it? I only deal with this every day, and I only am able to talk many women out of abortion when they learn that adoption is the choice that actually saves a human life. But of course, why not go work at a crisis pregnancy center yourself and see? Are you willing?\n \n \n\n Really? SO if you get hit anyway, then you consented to being hit? Such an outcome is a KNOWN risk of crossing the street. It has happened before. Otherwise, there would be no reason to look first. So you admit that there is a risk of being hit by a bus when you are a pedestrian. Does that mean that we shouldn't treat the person if they are hit by a bus? Or that we should only restrict treatment if they didn't look first?\n\n \n Sure, they should absolutly treat you, unless of course that means destroying an innocent, unwilling bystander in the process.\n \n \n\n And if they fail, or are not used, we still treat unwanted outcomes, just like we treat the guy run down by the bus regardless of how it happened.\n\n \n However, here is the drastic difference.

We are build so that sperm can be transferred to the egg and form a human being. Nature created us with the hormones that make us want to have sex, nature created us with the ability to have sex, and nature created us to have sex in order to reproduce. That is the purpose of sex with all species on this planet. Now, while some people make more of sex than simple reproduction, it is obvious from the results of sex that the purpose of sex is to reproduce. Always has been, always will be.

   "Wrong.\n What is manslaughter? That is illegal, however it is not murder.\nIt is analogous to murder. Murder is the illegal killing of a person. manslaughter is also the illegal killing of a person. There is a degree of legal difference between manslaughter and murder, but it doesn't mean that murder isn't the illegal killing of a person.\n \n Sheesh, I wish you would get this instead of making up weird, wrong claims.\n \nGetting hit by a bus is not the equivalent of abortion, now is it?\nNobody claimed that it was. Seems like you didn't read carefully enough.\n \n Rather, an unwanted pregnancy is like unwantedly being hit by a buss. It is a potential, unwanted consequence of a voluntary task. And the treatment for unwantedly being hit by a bus is then analogous to the treatment for an unwanted pregnancy.\n \n But I suspect this entire argument went over your head if you couldn't even get that straight.\n \nThat was not the point of it. I said, Killing is to murder as stealing it is to robbery. Sixth-grade concept.\nSome lousy school you went to.\n \n Stealing and robbery are both illegal. Abortion is legal while murder is not. As such, your rather stupid comparison merely demonstrates how poor your argument actually is, ESPECIALLY as you persist in this argument after having had the above pointed out to you.\n \nYes, it does seem that way. But if you knew anything about law whatsoever, you would know that anyone activly infringing on other's rights gives up any rights they have.\nNice to know that prolife hatemongering protesters, because they infringe on the woman's right to an abortion are giving up any right they have.\n \n But that is only an aside on the issue of your claim. You were at one point stating that it was illegal to kill another person, and at another point stated that it was legal to do so in self-defence. Which one is right? (Now that we got your red herring out of the way.)\n \n \nThe Supreme Court also said that \"seperate but equal\" was Constitutional as well, but you don't see that anymore...\nAnd they once pushed prohibition, then overruled themselves. They have also in the past upheld the execution of kids, but now have reversed themselves. Yes, when they initially base their rulings on state laws and then later reverse themselves, mainly based on state laws again (as these are the proxy for \"societal consensus), then you get such reversals. However, the US Constitution is fairly stable. Unless you change the 14th Amendment, the foundation for Roe vs Wade remains intact, f.ex.\n \nThink about this. Life, Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness were written in order of importance. So technically, it would be against the Constitution for a woman to infringe upon Life for Liberty or Pursuit of Happiness, wouldn't it?\n :xbanghead These noble words of the Declaration of Independence was put in the preamble of the US Constitution. They are NOT, however, part of the body of legal text. SHEESH, once again, I, an immigrant, find that I need to explain basic American legal concepts to Americans. Why is that? emoticon_rolleyes \n \nConsidering that I work at a crisis pregnancy center,\nWould this be one of those that have been caught lying to women through blatant scare mongering, by any chance? Perhaps one of those that claim abortion causes breast cancer or other medical lies?\n \n I guess my opinion doesn't matter, does it? I only deal with this every day, and I only am able to talk many women out of abortion when they learn that adoption is the choice that actually saves a human life. But of course, why not go work at a crisis pregnancy center yourself and see? Are you willing?\nI prefer accurate information as I can give in my clinic rather than the lies that I have experienced the CPC's to purvey.\n \nSure, they should absolutly treat you, unless of course that means destroying an innocent, unwilling bystander in the process.\nHmm, so you are not talking about abortion of unwanted pregnancies. Why didn't you say so? Because certainly, the products of conception are intruding where it is not wanted, and certainly the embryo or fetus does not have sentience and thus can not be willing, nor unwilling anything.\n \nHowever, here is the drastic difference. When you are hit by a bus, normally your life is in danger.\nReally? Broken legs, bruises, a bit of a contusion? Or are you only talking about buses going 60 mph?\n \nWhen you are pregnant, you are in no way in any danger at ALL.\nReally? Tell that to the about 350-500 women who die from pregnancy complications every year. Wonder how many are killed by busses?\n \n That aside, being hit by a bus is as unwanted as is an unwanted pregnancy, and there are medical remedies for both unwanted conditions. Sure seems like the analogy fits quite well.\n \nAlso, when you are hit by a bus, you do not have to kill anyone in order for your life to be saved, do you?\nBut then, during an abortion there also are not \"anyone\" killed, so your claim is irrelevant.\n \nReally, really bad analogy to use, buddy.\nNot really. Just really, really bad arguments that you are using.\n \nOf course, you are REALLY stupid if you decide to cross the street without looking both ways because you know that the paramedics will come and save you anyway. \nYou could. Does that then mean that you would deny the person medical care?\n \nNo, because that is the way nature created us.\nActually, we evolved, we weren't created. But that's an argument for another board.\n \nWe are build so that sperm can be transferred to the egg and form a human being.\nWe are also build so we can have sex and orgasms without getting pregnant. The \"purpose\" of sex is whatever the purpose of the people involved sees it as.\n \nNature created us with the hormones that make us want to have sex, nature created us with the ability to have sex, and nature created us to have sex in order to reproduce.\nAgain, noting was \"created.\" And just because sex can lead to pregnancy doesn't mean that it is the purpose\" of sex. Sex is what the participants make it to be. (And we can, of course, now reproduce without actually having sex.)\n \n...and nothing in nature is purposeless.\nReally? And you stand by that absolutist claim? I can think on multiple examples of natural events that don't happen for a \"purpose.\"",
