   "With Dominique DeVillepin's statement of today (Europe1.radio) that Turkey should recognize all 25 EU members states (namely Cyprus) before membership negociations could be opened, I believe that Ankara's bid to the EU has suffered the beginning of a major set back. This does not look like much, just a comment from the French Prime Minister. But DeVillepin is not just the latest French Prime Minister he is also a man of strong character and tremendous charisma as we noticed in the period leading up to the invasion of Iraq. Potentially, DeVillepin just opened today a new chapter in EU-Turkey relations. Greece will probably follow France in a NO to the opening of the negociations, of course Cyprus will too, I would be surprised if Austria, the Netherland and Denmark were not going to request a moratorium before opening the negociations. So, in brief I see today's DeVillepin's statement as a sign. For those of you who may not remember, nothing can go ahead in the enlargement process unless all 25 Heads of states agree.On the other side Erdogan has declared in the Turkish Parliament that his Gouvernment would never recognize the Republic of Cyprus . I see a deadlock. What do YOU see?",
