   "In brief, animals with genes that allow them to survive and reproduce tend to survive and reproduce, making more animals with those genes (the genes are selected for), while animals with genes that make them die or not reproduce tend to produce relatively few offspring (selecting against such genes). \n \n Over generations, populations of animals will therefore tend to have higher proportions with \"good\" genes. For example, in a population of 100 tigers, 50 of which have bad eyesight genes and 50 of which have efficient running genes, after many generations we would expect there to be relatively few tigers with bad eyesight and relatively many that could run efficiently.\n \n That is natural selection.\n \n Mutation is a process whereby new genetic material is introduced, which then enters into the process of selection. A tiger might be born with 6 legs or white fur.",
