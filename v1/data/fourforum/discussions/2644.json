   "Here's a good summary of the issues with the story of a historical Jesus.\n \n THE JESUS PUZZLE\n Pieces in a Puzzle of Christian Origins\n \n by Earl Doherty\n \n Part One\n PIECES IN THE PUZZLE\n \n That Jesus was a man who lived and preached in Palestine during the early first century, who gave rise to a faith movement centered upon himself which would go on to become one of the world's great religions, might seem to be a fairly straightforward proposition. The idea lies at the base of nearly 2000 years of Christian belief and remains the starting point for almost all scholarly study of Christian origins. And yet, accommodating such a simple assumption to the documentary evidence is an exceedingly difficult task, a puzzle whose solution has proven stubbornly, perplexingly, maddeningly elusive.\n \n If we could reduce the complexity of the evidence to a number of identifiable elements, including the wider setting of the times in which Christianity arose, we might come up with a list of ten puzzle pieces:\n \n Piece No. 1: A Conspiracy of Silence\n \n In the first half century of Christian correspondence, including letters attributed to Paul and other epistles under names like Peter, James and John, the Gospel story cannot be found. When these writers speak of their divine Christ, echoes of Jesus of Nazareth are virtually inaudible, including details of a life and ministry, the circumstances of his death, the attribution of any teachings to him. God himself is often identified as the source of Christian ethics. No one speaks of miracles performed by Jesus, his apocalyptic predictions, his views on any of the great issues of the time. The very fact that he preached in person is never mentioned, his appointment of apostles or his directive to carry the message to the nations of the world is never appealed to. No one looks back to Jesus' life and ministry as the genesis of the Christian movement, or as the pivot point of salvation history. The great characters of the Jesus story, Mary his mother, Joseph his father, John his herald, Judas his betrayer, Pilate his executioner: none of them receive a mention in all the Christian correspondence of the first century. As for holy places, there are none to be found, for not a single epistle writer breathes a word about any of the sites of Jesus' career, not even Calvary where he died for the world's sins, or the empty tomb where he rose from the dead to guarantee a universal resurrection.\n \n The one clear placement of Christ in recent times, the accusation in 1 Thessalonians 2:15-16 that Jews in Judea had killed the Lord Jesus, has been rejected as an interpolation by most of today's liberal scholars,1 while the one Gospel episode Paul seems to allude to, Jesus' words over the bread and wine at what he calls \"the Lord's Supper\" in 1 Corinthians 11:23f, can be interpreted as a mythical scene Paul has himself developed through perceived revelation (see Piece No. 5). Otherwise, no non-Gospel writer of the first century makes any statement which would link the divine spiritual Son and Christ they all worship and look to for salvation, with a man who had recently walked the sands of Palestine, taught and prophecied and performed miracles, a man executed by Pontius Pilate on Good Friday outside Jerusalem, to rise from a nearby tomb on Easter Sunday morning. This \"conspiracy of silence\" is as pervasive as it is astonishing. [See Part One: A Conspiracy of Silence in the Main Articles.]\n \n The Gospel Jesus and his story is equally missing from the non-Christian record of the time. Philo of Alexandria, the Jewish historian Justus of Tiberias, Pliny the Elder as collector of reputed natural phenomena, early Roman satirists and philosophers: all are silent. Pliny the Younger, in his letter to Trajan from Bithynia c.112, does not speak of Christ in historical terms. Josephus' famous passage in Antiquities 18 is acknowledged to be, as it stands, a Christian interpolation, and arguments that an original reference to Jesus either stood there or can be distilled from the present one, founder on the universal silence about such a reference on the part of Christian commentators until the 4th century.2 As for the reference in Antiquities 20 to James as \"brother of Jesus, the one called (the) Christ\", this passage also bears the marks of Christian interference.3 The phrase originally used by Josephus may have been the same designation which Paul gives to James (Galatians 1:19), namely \"brother of the Lord,\" which would have referred not to a sibling relationship with Jesus, but to James' position in the Jerusalem brotherhood, something which was probably widely known. A Christian copyist could later have altered the phrase (under the influence of Matthew 1:16) to render it more \"historical\" after Jesus of Nazareth was developed. [For a complete examination (and partial rethinking) of the Josephus question, see Supplementary Article No 10: Josephus Unbound: Reopening the Josephus Question.]\n \n The Roman historian Tacitus (Annals 15:44), is the first pagan writer to speak of Jesus as a man crucified by Pilate. Rather than representing information he dug out of an archive (the Romans would hardly have kept a record of the countless crucifixions around the empire going back a century), this was probably derived from Christian hearsay about a human founder of the movement, newly circulating in the Rome of Tacitus' day (c.115). On the other hand, there are those who question the authenticity of this passage as well. Around the same time, Suetonius' report (Claudius, 25) about Jews in Rome agitating under \"Chrestus\" in the reign of Claudius is so brief and uncertain, it may not be about Christ and Christians at all. In any case, it would not witness to an historical Jesus.\n \n As for the references to Jesus in the Jewish Talmud: even though some remarks are attributed to rabbis who flourished around the end of the first century (none earlier), they were not written down before the third century, and thus are unreliable. In any case, they are so cryptic and off the mark, they can scarcely be identified with the Gospel figure.\n \n [For the non-Christian witness to Jesus, see Postscript in the Main Articles.]\n \n Piece No. 2: A Transcendent Christ and a Missing Equation\n \n When early writers like Paul speak of their \"Christ Jesus\", they do so in exclusively mythological terms. He is the divine Son in heaven, speaking through scripture, connected to the believer in mystical ways. Christ Jesus is the very substance of Godhead, pre-existent and the image of the Father. Through him God effected creation, and his sustaining power holds the universe together. Christ is also the cosmic redeemer who descended from heaven to undergo a sacrificial death (an earthly time and place is never stated) and was subsequently exalted and enthroned by God's side. Through this saving drama, Christ has subjugated the demon spirits of the air who harass humanity, he has brought the souls of the dead righteous out of Shoel, he has been given kingship over all supernatural and earthly powers, and he has reconciled an estranged universe to God. He has also been given divine titles formerly reserved for God.\n \n Heady stuff. And all within two decades or less of the presumed man's life, a life which has apparently disappeared from the minds of those early believers in the cosmic Son, since they provide no mention of it, nor make any connection between the two. For all that Paul and others have to say about faith, no one ever raises the need to have faith that Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God and Messiah. The very equation: \"The divine, spiritual Son = Jesus of Nazareth, recently on earth,\" is universally missing.\n \n Even the death of Christ is presented in mythical terms. Passages like 1 Thessalonians 4:13 (\"We believe Jesus died and rose again\"), and the apparent designation of scripture as the source of Paul's doctrine that Christ died for our sins (1 Corinthians 15:3), suggest that Christ's death was an article of faith, not a remembered historical event. The same is true, of course, for the resurrection. Paul never places Jesus' death in an historical setting (he never even tells us that Christ was tried), and in 1 Corinthians 2:8 he assigns responsibility for the crucifixion to the \"rulers of this age\" who unwittingly crucified \"the Lord of glory\" and thereby ensured their own destined destruction.\n \n While the meaning of the phrase \"rulers of this age\" has been much debated, weight of opinion4 has come down on the side of the demon powers who were thought to inhabit the lower celestial spheres and were responsible for the evils of the world and its separation from God. This interpretation is supported by references to the demonic powers in relation to Christ's work in Colossians 2:15 and Ephesians 3:10; and by chapter 9 of the Ascension of Isaiah, which describes the descent of the Son through the heavenly spheres and declares that he shall be hung upon a tree \"by the god of that world,\" meaning Satan and his angels of the firmament. They, too, do not know who he is (9:13,15). [See Supplementary Article No. 3: Who Crucified Jesus?]\n \n 2 Timothy 1:9 is another passage which alludes to an upper-world, beyond-time setting for the redeeming act: \"God's grace was given to us in Christ Jesus pro chronon aionion-before the beginning of time...\" Knowledge of it has only now been brought to light by the revelation of the savior Jesus Christ (verse 10). The meaning of that Greek phrase is another much-debated item,5 but it would seem to be an attempt to convey that Christ's redeeming act took place outside the normal boundaries of time and space, in an upper Platonic realm of God.\n \n [For a fuller discussion of this \"piece\", see Part Two: Who Was Christ Jesus? and Supplementary Articles No. 3: Who Crucified Jesus? and No. 8: Christ as \"Man\".]\n \n Piece No. 3: A Time of Revelation\n \n How do Paul and other apostles like himself know of their Son and Redeemer? Is it through the words and deeds of Jesus on earth? Through traditions about him going back to those who had witnessed his ministry? No, Paul has learned of the Son through revelation and scripture. \"God chose to reveal his Son through me,\" he says in Galatians 1:16. The writer of Ephesians, in 3:4-5, gives us the main elements of the new revelatory drama: \"The mystery about Christ, which in former generations was not revealed to men, is now disclosed to dedicated apostles and prophets through the Spirit.\" Paul points to scripture (Romans 1:2, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4) as the source of his gospel, his knowledge about Christ and his saving work. It is God, through the Spirit, who has supplied this gospel, God who has appointed apostles like Paul to carry the message. All of it is couched in revelatory language, with words like phaneroo, apokalupto, epiphaneia.\n \n The existence and role of the divine Son has hitherto been unknown. He has been a secret, a \"mystery\" hidden for long ages with God in heaven, now revealed together with the benefits of his saving act. This is what Paul and the other epistle writers are constantly telling us: in Romans 3:21f, 16:25-27, Colossians 1:26 and 2:2, 1 Peter 1:20. They trace nothing back to a human Jesus and indeed, as in Titus 1:2-3, often leave no room for such a figure in their picture of the beginnings of the Christian movement.\n \n Instead, they speak of Christ as now present on earth (e.g., 1 John 5:20), sent by God as he has also sent the Spirit. (The Spirit and the Son are sometimes linked, as in Romans 8:9, Galatians 4:6, Phil. 1:19.) As the Pauline letters convey through the use of their ubiquitous phrase \"in-or through-Christ\" (e.g., Romans 6:11, Ephesians 1:4, Titus 3:6), Christ is a spiritual medium through which God is revealing himself and doing his work in the world. He is a mystical force, part of and interacting with his believers, and he is God's agent of salvation. All this lies plainly on the pages of the New Testament epistles, while beside it stands a void on the Gospel Jesus.\n \n [See Part Two: Who Was Christ Jesus? and Supplementary Article No. 6: The Source of Paul's Gospel.]\n \n Piece No. 4: The Mythological Picture of the Times\n \n When we examine the mythological features supposedly conferred upon an historical Jesus so soon after his passing, we find that they all have their roots in contemporary religious philosophy. The developing concept that an increasingly transcendent God required an intermediary in order to have contact with the base world of matter had led to the invention of secondary divine forces in both Greek and Jewish thinking. For the Greeks, as well as philosophers of Hellenistic Judaism like Philo, the Logos (largely an abstract concept) became the Platonic intermediary who was the image of God, the force which had produced creation, and a continual channel of spiritual communion between Deity and humanity.6 All these properties are present in the early Christian view of the spiritual Christ.\n \n In Jewish thinking, the figure of personified Wisdom was envisioned as an emanation of God, his communicating aspect and one who brought knowledge of him and his will to humanity. She developed her own myths about coming to the world and inviting men and women to learn from her (as in Proverbs, Baruch, the Wisdom of Solomon). She eventually became very Logos-like, described as God's agent of creation and the divine power that pervades and sustains all things (Wisdom of Solomon 7:22-30). She was God's throne-partner and his very image.\n \n These features, too, are part of the language about Christ used by Paul and his contemporaries. Christ sits at the right hand of God, it was through him that \"all things came to be and we through him,\" (1 Corinthians 8:6); he too sustains the universe by his word of power (Hebrews 1:3, Colossians 1:15f). Like the Logos and Sophia (Wisdom), only the Son \"knows\" the Father, and humanity can only know God through the Son.\n \n [See Part Two: Who Was Christ Jesus? and Supplementary Article No. 5: Tracing the Christian Lineage in Alexandria.]\n \n Piece No. 5: Savior Deities in a Layered Universe\n \n The most popular expression of religious faith during the era which saw the rise of Christianity was not the official state religion of \"Olympian\" gods, but the salvation cults known as the \"mystery religions\". Each of these had its savior god or goddess, such as Mithras, Dionysos, Attis, Isis, Osiris. Most of these cults possessed myths in which the savior deity had overcome death in some way (not necessarily raised from it), or performed some act whose effects guaranteed for the initiates good fortune in this world and a happy existence in the next. Their rituals included communal sacred meals, often involving such things as bread and wine and bearing strong resemblance to Christian sacramentalism (Paul's Lord's Supper myth may well have been influenced by Mithraic counterparts), and the mystical relationships between initiate and deity are very similar to those expounded by Paul in his branch of Christian belief. While Christianity and the pagan cults interacted on one another as time went on, both can be regarded as more or less independent branches of the same broad, ancient-world tree. [For the mysteries, see Part Two: Who Was Christ Jesus? and Supplementary Article No. 6: The Source of Paul's Gospel: Learning of a Sacred Meal, and Response to Miles.]\n \n In the period around the turn of the era, Platonism divided the universe into a timeless, perfect higher realm (containing the \"genuine\" reality, accessible to the intellect), and an imperfect, transient world of matter as its copy. The mythical activity of the cultic gods was thought to take place in this upper dimension of reality, having effects on humanity below. (Such Platonic-style thinking tended to supplant older views of myth which regarded this activity of gods as having occurred in a primordial, sacred past.) This was combined with other, more popular views which saw the universe as multi-layered, from the world of base matter where humans lived, to the highest level of pure spirit where the ultimate God dwelled. The layers between (usually seven, plus the air or \"firmament\" between earth and moon) were populated by various sorts of angels, spirits and demons. The latter, responsible for the evils that afflicted mankind and in the Jewish mind associated with Satan, filled the lowest spirit layer and were regarded as part of the realm of \"flesh\",7 cutting off earth from heaven.\n \n To perform their salvific work, the savior gods descended into the lower reaches of the spiritual world, taking on increasing resemblance to lower and material forms: Attis, for example (so Julian the \"Apostate\" relates in Orations V), to the level just above the moon; Christ, so Paul indicates in 1 Corinthians 2:8, along with the writer of the Ascension of Isaiah 9, to the sphere of Satan and his powers in the firmament. Here Christ, having assumed the \"likeness\" of flesh and a man (Ascension 9:13 and Philippians 2:7-8), was crucified. As passages like Ephesians 6:12 indicate, a cosmic battle was going on for control of the world, between the forces of darkness headed by Satan, and the forces of good directed by God. Christ was God's agent, his Messiah, in this struggle. The crucifixion was regarded as a decisive move in the cosmic battle with the demons, wherein Christ subjected these spirits to himself and restored the unity of the universe (Ephesians 1:10). [See Supplementary Article No. 3: Who Crucified Jesus?]\n \n More sophisticated philosophers like Plutarch and Sallustius regarded the stories of the Greek salvation cults as allegorical interpretations only, \"eternal meanings clothed in myth.\" Sallustius, writing in the 4th century, speaks of the story of Attis as \"an eternal cosmic process, not an isolated event of the past\" (On Gods and the World, 9). Paul, while he shows no sign of regarding the myth and suffering of Jesus in anything but literal terms, would have been quite capable of placing such redeeming activity in this upper, spiritual realm, and indeed his language shows every sign of such an interpretation.\n \n [See Part Two: Who Was Christ Jesus? and Supplementary Article No. 8: Christ as \"Man\": section I.]\n \n Piece No. 6: A Single Story of Jesus\n \n The story of Jesus of Nazareth is, for the first hundred years of Christianity, to be found only in the Gospels. Moreover, each of the Gospels is dependent for that story on the first one written, \"Mark\". That Matthew and Luke are reworkings of Mark with extra, mostly teaching, material added, is now almost universally accepted. Opinion is split as to whether the narrative elements of John are derived from some Synoptic source as well. But since the Fourth Gospel, despite some considerable revamping to fit John's own theology, gives us no fundamentally different material in its narrative of Jesus' life from that of the Synoptics, it is likely that it too goes back ultimately to the first Gospel for its picture of the \"historical Jesus.\" (The so-called Discourses and distinctive Johannine Christology may well be the earliest layer of tradition, originally applied to a spiritual Revealer Son, upon which the \"historical\" Synoptic-derived biography has been overlaid.) We thus have a Christian movement spanning half the empire and a full century of existence which nevertheless has managed to produce only one version of the events that are supposed to lie at its inception.\n \n Modern scholars often refer to the common teaching and anecdotal material extracted from Matthew and Luke, now known by the designation \"Q\", as a \"Gospel\", though it is not a narrative work, nor organized according to any other fashion than the traditional sayings collection. But their confident claim that the material of this lost document, or at least the earliest stratum of it, can be traced back to an historical Jesus and thus constitutes an independent witness to him is not warranted, as I will try to demonstrate in Part Three [of this article].\n \n Acts, too, as an historical witness to Jesus or the beginnings of the Christian movement, cannot be relied upon. The more recent tendency is to see Acts as a second century product, probably of Roman provenance, highly tendentious and written for the purpose of creating a picture of Christian origins traceable to a unified body of apostles in Jerusalem who were followers of an historical Jesus. Much of it is sheer fabrication, and highly incompatible with information found in the letters of Paul. There is no attestion for Acts prior to the 170s.\n \n [See Part Three: The Evolution of Jesus of Nazareth.]\n \n Piece No. 7: The Gospels in Limbo\n \n The dating of the Gospels is partly to be determined by their attestion in the wider Christian writings. Here we run into an astonishing state of affairs, for there is no clear sign of them before the middle of the second century. No surviving writer before Justin makes use of narrative documents containing words and deeds of Jesus of Nazareth, and more often than not Justin's quotations do not fit our canonical texts, indicating that such works were still in the process of development, not to be finalized until some time later.\n \n Earlier allusions to teachings or anecdotes resembling those of the Gospels seem not to be from written works, but probably reflect developing traditions which themselves found their way into the written Gospels.8 And Papias' reference (around 120-130?, as reported by Eusebius) to documents attributed to \"Matthew\" and \"Mark\" cannot be reconciled with the narrative Gospels which now go by those names, names which were still unknown to Justin as belonging to his \"memoirs of the Apostles\". Moreover, these were documents which Papias himself had not seen,9 but had learned about from another, making the whole report a distant third hand.\n \n Thus, when scholars regularly date the Gospels between 65 and 100, they present us with a scenario in which the story of Jesus' life as told by the evangelists remains in a limbo and fails to register on the wider Christian consciousness for almost a hundred years after it was first committed to paper. A generally later dating would seem to be required, perhaps with Mark in its initial version coming no earlier than the year 90. (The standard dating based on Mark 13 is not necessarily valid, since apocalyptic expectations continued until at least the end of the century, and Jesus' suggestion in 13:7 is that some time must pass after the Jewish War before the End-time arrives.)\n \n [See Part Three: The Evolution of Jesus of Nazareth.]\n \n Piece No. 8: The Gospels Not History\n \n When the content of the Gospels is examined, two fundamental characteristics emerge to cast serious doubt on the historicity of their story of Jesus.\n \n One is their incompatible nature. The irreconcilability of such things as the baptism and nativity stories, the finding of the empty tomb and Jesus' post-resurrection appearances, is, of course, universally recognized, but the myriad other contradictions and disagreements in the accounts of Jesus' words and deeds are more than simple divergences in eyewitness testimony or imperfections in transmission. Since at least the middle of this century, scholars have recognized that the non-agreement between the evangelists, or between an evangelist and his sources, is editorial, deliberate. That is, these writers were consciously redacting their received material according to their own beliefs and purposes, while many Gospel elements are recognized to be the evangelists' own creation. It follows that, if even the purported words of the Lord could be arbitrarily changed or invented for tendentious reasons, there could be no thought of preserving \"history\". These writers obviously looked upon their stories as artificial products, designed for the needs of their own communities. Such insights have led the last two generations of scholars (and more) to label the Gospels \"faith documents\", not historical accounts.\n \n The second characteristic is the dependence of so many elements of the Jesus story on passages and motifs from the Jewish scriptures. The Passion story is a veritable pastiche of verses from the Psalms, Isaiah and various other prophets. Overall, it represents the new telling of a tale found repeatedly throughout the Hebrew bible and related writings. Scholars call it The Suffering and Vindication of the Innocent Righteous One. The story of Jesus' fate follows in virtual lockstep this age-old pattern, its details culled from scriptural passages. No history in view here.\n \n This process of mining the scriptures was a reflection of a traditional Jewish practice known as \"midrash\", in which the writer interpreted and enlarged upon individual or combinations of passages from the bible to draw out new meanings and relevance, to offer a new truth for contemporary times. One midrashic method was to refashion an existing biblical narrative in a new setting. Thus Jesus was portrayed as a new Moses, with features which paralleled the stories of Moses.\n \n John Shelby Spong (in his Liberating the Gospels) regards the Synoptic Gospels as midrashic fiction in virtually every detail, though he believes it was based on an historical man. Spong, building on earlier research by Michael D. Goulder,10 has argued that the Gospel story was designed to provide suitable lectionary material for year-round Christian observances, based on the traditional cycle of Jewish Sabbath and festival themes. This would entirely remove from the Gospels any semblance of history.[See the book review of Spong's Liberating the Gospels.]\n \n [See Part Three: The Evolution of Jesus of Nazareth.]\n \n Piece No. 9: A Diverse Patchwork\n \n If Christianity is to be regarded as a single movement, then it is a wildly schizophrenic one. The variety and scale of response to one man defies explanation. The \"cultic\" expression, epitomized by Paul, apparently abandoned all interest in the earthly life and identity of Jesus and turned him into a cosmic Christ who created the world and redeemed it by his death and resurrection. Individual communities like those responsible for the Q document and the Gospel of Thomas, ignored that death and resurrection and present a teaching Jesus, a preacher of the coming Kingdom of God. In what is probably the earliest stratum of material in the Gospel of John, Jesus is a type of \"descending-ascending\" redeemer from heaven who saves by being God's revealer (though he reveals nothing about him except that Jesus is his Son and representative); later, John equates Jesus with the Greek Logos. In the Epistle to the Hebrews, Jesus is the heavenly High Priest who offers his sacrifice in a heavenly sanctuary, an expression of Alexandrian-style Platonism. In the Didache, Jesus is reduced to a non-suffering intermediary servant/child of God. He is presumed to lie behind the Wisdom-Word-Son mysticism of the Odes of Solomon. In the diverse strands of Gnosticism, Jesus (or Christ) is a mythical part of the heavenly pleroma of Godhead, sometimes a revealer akin to John's, sometimes surfacing under other names like Derdekeas or the Third Illuminator.11 How many other forms of \"Jesus\" did not survive in extant documents is impossible to tell, though Paul in his letters hints at divergent groups and apostles all over the place, who \"preach another Jesus\" so different from his own that he can lay curses upon them and accuse them of being agents of Satan.\n \n Scholars like Burton Mack12 think to find behind the Gospels and other documents all sorts of little groups preserving and formulating this or that type of tradition about Jesus and viewing him in different ways. The Jesus extracted from Q and assigned to a Q community is only the most prominent of these. All this fragmentation of an historical man, the breakup of Jesus into a multitude of component parts, is an unprecedented phenomenon, and not only does no document exist which embodies such a process or even gives a clue as to why it took place, each of these component parts seems blissfully unaware of the others. Paul's letters give no hint that there were communities centered around the very elements of Jesus' life and preaching which he had abandoned as of no interest. On the other hand, communities like that of Q seem impervious to the cosmic dimensions which the cultic circles have bestowed upon their preacher of the Kingdom. Only the evangelists (which is to say, the first of them, Mark) thought to bring these disparate elements together. The question is, where did all the various elements come from, and were they associated with a human Jesus in their pre-Gospel stages?\n \n [See Part Three: The Evolution of Jesus of Nazareth, and the book review of Burton Mack's Who Wrote the New Testament?]\n \n Piece No. 10: The Second Century\n \n If the historical Jesus seems unknown to all in the first century but the early evangelists (and, in a different sense, the later redactors of Q), the first stirrings of a \"knowledge\" of an historical Jesus emerge soon after the second century gets under way. Ignatius in his letters (by tradition written around 107 while on his way to martyrdom in Rome) offers the earliest non-Gospel reference to Jesus as a man born of Mary at the time of Herod and crucified by Pontius Pilate. Shortly after, Tacitus' reference appears, the first in non-Christian literature identifying Jesus as an historical man who was executed at the time of Pilate. Polycarp (writing about 130?), reflects the same outlook as Ignatius, and the Epistle of Barnabas (c. 120?) seems to regard Jesus as an historical man, but the writer is still dependent on scripture for much of what he assigns to this figure. If Eusebius is to be relied upon, Papias too reflects a belief in an historical Jesus (in Asia Minor), and he witnesses (at second hand) to some circulating collections of sayings and possibly anecdotes that have become associated with this figure.\n \n And yet, there are major Christian writings of the second century which fail to present an historical Jesus. Both the Didache (which may have roots in the late first century) and the monumental Shepherd of Hermas are devoid of any such figure; the latter never utters the name Jesus. Even the New Testament epistles generally dated in the early second century, 2 Peter and the three Pastorals, seem to lack an historical man. (The sole reference to Pilate in the New Testament epistles, 1 Timothy 6:13, has been examined with some suspicion by certain commentators13, since it doesn't seem to fit the context well. I regard it, along with 1 Thessalonians 2:15-16, as an interpolation.)\n \n Most astonishingly, all the major apologists before the year 180, with the sole exception of Justin (and a minor apologist from Syria, Aristides), fail to include an historical Jesus in their defences of Christianity to the pagans. This includes Tatian in his pre-Diatessaron days. Instead, the apologists bear witness to a Christian movement which is grounded in Platonic philosophy and Hellenistic Judaism, preaching the worship of the monotheistic Jewish God and a Logos-type Son; the latter is a force active in the world who serves as revealer and intermediary between God and humanity. Theophilus of Antioch, Athenagoras of Athens, Tatian in his Apology, Minucius Felix in Rome (or North Africa) offer no beliefs in an historical figure crucified as an atoning act, nor in a resurrection. (Nor do they have anything in common with Paul.) In not one of them does the name Jesus appear, and none speak of an incarnation of their Logos. Theophilus explains the meaning of the name \"Christian\" as signifying that \"we are anointed with the oil of God.\"\n \n Minucius Felix heaps scorn on any doctrine of a crucified man as divine and redeemer (indicating that he is aware of some who hold to such a thing), while Tatian alludes to \"stories\" told by both Greeks and Christians, implying that both are of the same nature, mythical tales not to be taken literally. Only Justin has embraced the story and the figure as presented in some early form of written Gospel, but even he, in recounting his conversion experience of a couple of decades earlier (Dialogue with Trypho, 3-8), shows a telltale void about belief in an historical man in the faith movement he joined. Into Trypho's mouth (8:6) he places the accusation that \"you invent a Christ for yourselves.\"\n \n \n Notes\n \n 1 Since it contains an unmistakable allusion to the destruction of Jerusalem, and because it is not in keeping with what Paul elsewhere says about his fellow countrymen. See, for example, Birger Pearson: 1 Thessalonians 2:13-16: A Deutero-Pauline Interpolation, HTR 64 (1971), 79-94. [See Supplementary Article No. 3: Who Crucified Jesus?: The Jews \"Who Killed the Lord Jesus\".]\n \n 2 For example, Origen, in his Contra Celsum discusses a few times (e.g., I, 46 and 67) the veracity of Jesus' miracles; if Josephus had referred to Jesus as a \"doer of wonderful deeds\" (as scholars like J. D. Crossan claim), he would hardly have passed up the opportunity to appeal to the Jewish historian's witness. Some claim that Origen's statement in Contra Celsum I, 47 that Josephus \"did not believe in Jesus as the Christ\" constitutes an oblique reference to such a passage, but this is better explained as Origen's reaction to the fact that Josephus declares, in Jewish Wars VI, 312-13, that the Jews' predictions about a Messiah really applied to the emperor Vespasian. [See Supplementary Article No. 10: Josephus Unbound.]\n \n 3 Origen uses a copy which has Josephus regarding the destruction of Jerusalem as a divine punishment for the murder of James, whereas no surviving copy of Josephus makes any such suggestion. [See the sections on the \"lost reference\" in Josephus Unbound.]\n \n 4 E.g., Origen, Barrett, H\u00e9ring, Delling (TDNT I, 489), Schoeps, Salmond. See Paul Ellingworth, A Translator's Handbook for 1 Corinthians, p.46: \"A majority of scholars think that supernatural powers are intended here.\" [See Supplementary Article No. 3: Who Crucified Jesus?: The Rulers of this Age.]\n \n 5 J. D. Quinn in the Anchor Bible Commentaries (Titus, p.65) says that \"the phrase pro chronon aionion refers to the timeless order in which God himself lives, in contrast to the chronoi aionioi (as in Romans 16:25) through which the world has passed in history. Cf. James Barr, Biblical Words For Time, p.138f.\n \n 6 The little document called Discourse to the Greeks and erroneously ascribed to Justin Martyr shows that the Logos could be looked upon as an agency of salvation. Here it takes on decidedly personal characteristics in that it \"has ceaseless care over us,\" and \"makes mortals become immortal, human beings gods\" (5). See E. R. Goodenough, By Light, Light, p.300.\n \n 7 See under Sarx in TDNT VII, 128.\n \n 8 Helmut Koester's groundbreaking search for Synoptic references in the writings of the early Fathers, Synoptische \u00dcberlieferung bei den apostolischen V\u00e4tern, concludes that almost all such references come from a pre-Gospel layer of tradition.\n \n 9 If Papias' (now lost) Oracles of the Lord Interpreted had contained quotations from such Gospels, later commentators, like Eusebius and Philip of Side, would certainly have referred to them. Nor is it likely that if he had full narrative Gospels of Jesus' life Papias would have disparaged written works and preferred oral traditions, as he is reported to have said. Papias tells, in the fragments quoted by Eusebius, that his information about \"Mark\" came from \"the Presbyter\", but whether this was also the case concerning \"Matthew\" Eusebius is not clear, though it is likely. All Papias witnesses to (assuming we can trust Eusebius) is that a couple of decades or so into the second century, there were certain circulating collections of sayings and possibly anecdotes, probably of a prophetic nature, one of them in Hebrew or Aramaic, which had begun to be attributed to an historical Jesus and associated with the names of early reputed followers of him.\n \n 10 Midrash and Lection in Matthew, The Evangelist's Calendar, Luke: A New Paradigm [See the book review of John Shelby Spong's Liberating the Gospels.]\n \n 11 See The Paraphrase of Shem and The Apocalypse of Adam (NHC VII,1 and V,5)\n \n 12 Who Wrote the New Testament?

   "Mizmaxx claims she's not anti-Christian, but she's posted so much denying the historic Jesus it's impossible to me to reconcile her words with her acts.\n \n Even going to the point of trying to re-work Josephus herself...\n \n \n But...\n \"HISTORICAL RECORDS \n \n Roman historian Cornelius Tacitus recorded information pertaining to Jesus, thus removing the only supporting source for His existence as being in the New Testament. In 115 A.D., Tactius wrote about the great fire in Rome, \"Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberious at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their center and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty; then upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind. Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths, Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished, or were nailed to crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt, to serve as a nightly illumination, when daylight had expired. Nero offered his gardens for the spectacle, and was exhibiting a show in the circus, while he mingled with the people in the dress of charioteer or stood aloft on a car. Hence, even for criminals who deserved extreme and exemplary punishment, there arose a feeling of compassion; for it was not, as it seemed, for the public good, but to glut one man's cruelty, that they were being destroyed.\" \n \n It is believed by some scholars that Tactius gained his information about Christ from official records, perhaps actual reports written by Pilate. Tactius also wrote about the burning of the Jerusalem temple by the Romans in 70 A.D. The Christians are mentioned as a group that were connected with these events. \"All we can gather from this reference is that Tactius was also aware of the existence of Christians other than in the context of their presence in Rome,\" states Habermas. Gaius Suetonius Tranquillas, chief secretary of Emperor Hadrian, wrote, \"Because the Jews at Rome caused continuous disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, he expelled them from the City.\" Chrestus is a variant spelling of Christ. Suetonius refers to a wave of riots that broke out in a large Jewish community in Rome during the year 49 A.D. As a result, the Jews were banished from the city.\"\n http://www.sonic.net/sentinel/naij3.html",

Alan Millard, Discoveries From the Time of Jesus \n \n The tombs were discovered during the rebuilding of a Franciscan chapel and excavated from 1953 to 1955. \n \n \"A tomb of the Late Bronze period gave finds which are important for the civilization of Jerusalem just at the time of its conquest by the Hebrews. A necropolis used from 136 BC to 300 AD produced a great amount of material. The necropolis had two periods each with different styles and cultures. The first, the earlier is characterized by Kokhim (oven-shaped) tombs running from 185 BC, while the second is characterized by tombs with an arcosolium belonging to the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. With the Kokhim tombs are closely connected the sarcophagus and the ossuary; the first cut in hard stone (mizzi) follow the motifs of classical art, both in structure and subject, in close artistic relation with the Tombs of the kings and 'Herod's' of the 1 cent. AD; the ossuaries, on the other hand in soft stone (kacooley) follow a local trade technique with architectonic and floral motifs. \n \"On the ossuaries were found many more or less symbol signs (crosses, tau, Constantinian monograms) and 43 inscriptions (Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek) incised or traced with charcoal. Of interest is the recurrence of names common in the New Testament, as Mary, Martha, Philo the Cyrene, Matthew, Joseph, Jesus.\" \n - Dominus Flevit the site where \"The Lord Wept\" \n \n Caesar's Decree - c. 50 C.E.\n \"A stone slab found in Nazareth, of height 0.61m is inscribed (in Greek) with a decree demanding the death penalty for anyone who broke the seals on a tomb or stole a dead body.\" (Attributed date c. 50 C.E.) \n - Summarized extract - IVP Three Volume Bible Dictionary (under section for Nazareth) \n \n \"It is my pleasure that graves and tombs remain undisturbed in perpetuity for those who have made them for the cult of their ancestors, or children, or members of their house. If, however, any man lay information that another has either demolished them, or has in any other way extracted the buried, or has maliciously transferred them to other places in order to wrong them, or has displaced the sealing or other stones, against such a one I order that a trial be instituted, as in respect of the gods, so in regard to the cult of mortals. For it shall be much more obligatory to honour the buried. Let it be absolutely forbidden for anyone to disturb them. In the case of contravention I desire that the offender be sentenced to capital punishment on charge of violation of sepulture.\" \n - Ordinance of Caesar\n \n \"The Emperor threatens the death penalty for interference with, or the removal of bodies from, tombs, may belong to any date from Augustus to Claudius.\" \n - Summarized extract - Peakes Commentary of the Bible \n (Various sections found from index under Claudius' expulsion of Jews from Rome and Tombs, sanctity of.) \n \n The original owner of the stone left only a short note about its origins when he donated it to the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale in Paris - \"Marble slab sent from Nazareth in 1878.\" \n \n \"Nazareth may be the place, but the finder could have carried it there from somewhere else, a few days' donkey journey away, wanting to sell it to Christian pilgrims. Since the nature of the connection with Nazareth is uncertain, no argument linking the stone with the early Christians can rely on its. Unless the stone was set up on Judaea and moved northwards later, Pontius Pilate cannot have had it made, because Galilee was in the kingdom of Herod Antipas, where Pilate had no power. Indeed, even a decree of Caesar would hardly be displayed in Galilee until after Antipas' reign ended in AD 44. That means it is possible that Claudius made the decree.\" \n - Alan Millard, Discoveries From the Time of Jesus \n \n \"Why would a Caesar have any cause to take such a specific interest in this part of the Empire and in a matter which, apparently, not an issue of Roman state? Surely this would seem to be better resolved by local Government and not one to demand the intervention of the Emperor.

VII, vi, 15) . Orosius puts this in Claudius' ninth year, 25th Jan. AD 49 - 24th Jan. AD 50. The later claiming to have extracted the date from Josephus, however, our copies of Josephus do not contain such an entry. Claudius had expelled from Rome the Jews who were 'incessantly causing tumults with Chrestus as the instigator'.\" \n - Summarized extract - Peakes Commentary of the Bible: \n \n \"Since the Jews were constantly causing disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, he [Claudius] expelled them from Rome.\" \n - Suetonius, Lives of the Caesars - Claudius 5.25.4 (c. 120 CE) \n \n \"The Emperor Claudius, around the year 49-50, expelled the Jews from Rome (Acts 18:2) because (says Suetonius) they were fomenting disorder at the instigation of one Chrestos. It seems plausible that there were disputes in Rome between Jews who believed that the body of Jesus was missing from the tomb because he had risen, and Jews who believed that it had been stolen. When these disputes caused public disorder, Claudius (or his deputy) made inquiries, expelled both sides from the city (after the manner of a parent who, when two children are fighting over a toy, takes it away from both of them for the time being), and then ordered a stern decree against grave-robbing to be promulgated at the places where the disturbance had begun. Presumably these would include at least (1) Jerusalem, where the alleged corpse-snatching had taken place, and (2) Nazareth, the home town of the alleged corpse.\" \n - James Kiefer \n \n \"The report that Claudius expelled the Jews from Rome in A.D. 41 because they were, 'at the instigation of Chrestus, repeatedly rioting,' probably refers to some local troublemaker.\" \n - Morton Smith, Jesus the Magician: Charlatan or Son of God? (1978) p. 66 \n \n \"A short note on the name 'Chrestus': From the examination of the Greek for Chrestus and Christos I have observed that the former is a common slave name which has the basic meaning of 'good' and the latter derived from the rare Greek word (rare or just closest?) 'to anoint' and thus Christos is the best match for the Aramaic word 'messiah' - which also, essentially means 'anointed one' with the Jewish associations of king, etc. What may be important is that while both names basically mean something different from each other they are, I have read, phonetically the same.\" \n - Mark Carlin \n \n \"'Chrestus' is the correct Latin form of a very common Greek name and is not a misspelling, but some scholars believe that Seutonius meant to use 'Christos' instead. One problem with this (if indeed Seutonius was referring to Christ) is that the context of the passage suggests that someone named Chrestus was living in Rome at the time, a century after Jesus. Kee and Wells get around this problem by assuming that Seutonius was referring to Christian preachers who were announcing that the Messiah in Jesus was coming. Kee (Jesus in History) also adds that Suetonius may have had his dates confused and was instead referring to the actual disturbances that occurred during the reign of Tiberius (14-37 CE). Wells (The Jesus of the Early Christians) is not as generous and sticks closer to the known in that 'Chrestus' was probably an agitator who emerged from the Roman ghetto proclaiming himself as the Messiah. Messianic fervor ran high during the time of the fall of Jerusalem (70 CE) and this is a highly likely explanation. In any case, it is very difficult to construe from Suetonius anything that even remotely speaks to the historicity of Jesus.\" \n - James Still, \"Biblical and Extrabiblical Sources for Jesus\" \n \n \"Could it be that the expulsion of the \"Jews\" (which might include any associated bickering faction) was as a result of a dispute in which one party had claimed that a grave had been robbed? In my mind, both Aquina and Priscilla were Christian before they were expelled from Rome (though I know this is debated) and migrated to Corinth (Acts). Also, when Paul first visited Rome he was greeted by the 'brethren' (in Acts) which again leads me to the opinion that Rome had Christians from a very early date. \n \"If there is connection between Suetonius' report and the archaeological find in Galilee (and I realize that this is speculative) it raises a distinct possibility that the early critics of Christianity held the view that the Christian claim to a resurrection was a false claim and that the earlier movement had themselves removed the body of the dead Jesus. Also, that the charge was so strongly held and expressed that a tumulus of such magnitude arose which led Caesar Claudius to expel the lot of them rather than risk riots in the streets of Rome.\" \n - Mark Carlin \n \n Thallus' Eclipse - 52 C.E.\n A \"passage on Jesus was contained in Thallus' work on the Eastern Mediterranean world from the Trojan War to 52 A.D. Thallus noted that darkness fell on the land at the time of the crucifixion. He wrote that such a phenomenon was caused by an eclipse.\" \n - Harry V. Martin. \"Proving the Historic Jesus\" \n \n According to McDowell, Evidence that Demands a Verdict, \"Thallus, a Samaritan-born historian mentioned Christ in 52 C.E. However his works are no longer extant, so we have only citations of it by others...Julius Africanus, a Christian writing about 221, says, talking about the darkness that fell when Christ was crucified, 'Thallus, in the third book of his histories, explains away this darkness as an eclipse of the sun -- unreasonably, as it seems to me.' (It is unreasonable because the crucifixion was at Passover, which is based on the lunar calendar and requires a full moon. When there's a full moon, the moon is at the opposite side of the earth from where it has to be for an eclipse.)\". \n \"Phelgon, another first-century historian, is also quoted by Africanus as saying 'during the time of Tiberius Caesar an eclipse of the sun occurred during the full moon'. Phelgon's comment (presumably the same one) is also referred to by Philopon.\" \n - James Kiefer \n \n Mara's Letter - c. 73 C.E.\n \n \"What advantage did the Athenians gain from putting Socrates to death? Famine and plague came upon them as a judgment for their crime. What advantage did the men of Samos gain from burning Pythagoras? In a moment their land was covered with sand. What advantage did the Jews gain from executing their wise king? It was just after that that their kingdom was abolished. God justly avenged these three wise men: the Athenians died of hunger; the Samians were overwhelmed by the sea; the Jews, ruined and driven from their land, live in complete dispersion. But Socrates did not die for good; he lived on in the teaching of Plato. Pythagoras did not die for good; he lived on in the statue of Hera. Nor did the wise king die for good; he lived on in the teaching which he had given.\" \n - Mara bar Serapion, letter to his son from prison\n \n According to F. F. Bruce, The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable? (p. 114), the Mara bar Serapion letter was \" written some time later than A. D. 73, but how much later we cannot be sure.\" Written in Syriac, this letter may actually have originated in the 2nd or 3rd century C.E. The \"wise king\" is not identified by Mara bar Serapion and may have lived in the same time frame as Socrates and Pythagoras - half a millenium earlier than Jesus. \n \n \"The Bible itself recorded the political assassinations of Jewish royalty that occurred close enough to Nebuchadnezzar's capture of Jerusalem [586 B.C.E.] to consider the conquest of either Israel or Judea as an event that had happened 'just after' the murder of one of these kings. Josiah's father, King Amon, for example, was assassinated less than 50 years before Nebuchadnezzar's siege of Jerusalem (2 Kings 21:23).\" \n - Farrell Till, \"The 'Testimony' of Mara Bar-Serapion\" \n \n \"Amon's officials conspired against him and assassinated the king in his palace.\"\n - 2 Kings 21:23\n \n It should also be noted that the letter contains an historical inaccuracy. Pythagoras was not burned by the men of Samos but died later in Metapontum (contemporary Metaponto), Italy. \n \n Magical Gems and Graffiti - c. 200 C.E.\n \"...Already in Jesus' lifetime magicians began to use his name in their spells. Acts 19.13 shows that the practice was continued, even by Jewish magicians, after his death. Accordingly, of the three oldest representations of the crucifixion, two are on magical gems...\" \n \n \n \"Perhaps the earliest of all representations of the crucifixion is a graffito, a picture scratched on the plaster of a schoolroom on the Palatine hill in Rome. It shows a crucified figure seen from behind. The feet rest on a small crossbar, the head is turned to one side. On that side, slightly below, stands a young man, one hand raised in reference. A misspelled Greek inscription reads 'Alexamenos reveres God.' The date is about 200, possibly a bit before...But the head of the crucified figure is that of a donkey. \n \"There was a long standing legend that the god of the Jews was a donkey, or donkey-headed. The legend probably arose from the fact that the donkey was the sacred animal of Seth, the villain in the Egyptian pantheon, who was commonly thought by the Egyptians to be the god of foreigners. He was also, being a villain, given a large role in magic, and often appears as a donkey-headed figure on magical gems. The Jews were among the largest groups of foreigners in Egypt, so their god, Iao, was identified with Seth. Io or Eio in Coptic means 'donkey,' so the identification was almost predetermined.\" \n - Morton Smith, Jesus the Magician: Charlatan or Son of God?

   "Here are a list of writings with some conection to Jesus that pre-date Origien\n\n Please, quote one that evidences a historical Jesus. \n \n \nThen...\n \"(1) Tombs, Ordinances and Graffiti\n\n Again, all could be evidence of a mythological Jesus, not a historical one.\n \n I'd also like to point out, given the title of the thread, that Nazareth itself did not exist, in maps or references, until centuries after the supposed time of Christ. The belief that there was a Jesus of Nazareth comes from a misreading of scripture- the OT frequently speaks of Nazarites, as in \"he shall be a Nazarite\". Nazarites were a sect of particularly devout Hebrew priests who never cut their hair, hence the references to razors never touching their heads. \n \n'For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.' \n(Judges 13.5) \n \n \nMizmaxx claims she's not anti-Christian, but she's posted so much denying the historic Jesus it's impossible to me to reconcile her words with her acts.\n\n I can't help the lack of historical evidence for a historic Jesus. Feel free to keep believing the Gospels, and that Jesus is the son of God. That is a matter of faith, not evidence. I'm not arguing against your faith, so I don't see how you can say that I'm anti-Christian.",

   "Luke 2\n 1 In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. 2 (This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.) 3 And everyone went to his own town to register. \n 4 So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. 5 He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. 6 While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, 7 and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son.

   "Mizmaxx contends that Josephus is a forgery (or, that it's been 'beefed-up' by Christians).

Although Meier regards the latter as retorjectory in nature, we may suggest that it is something that simply lacked emphasis in the Gospels. \n Jesus was called \"Christ\" by some. \n Jesus was a worker of surprising deeds - an allusion perhaps to miracle-working power. \n Jesus was executed by Pilate by means of crucifixion. \n His execution was prompted in part by the leaders among the Jews. \n Christians were \"named\" from Him - which confirms Tacitus' own usage of the terminology.\"\n http://www.tektonics.org/tekton_01_01_01_JOS.html\n \n She needs to show that each of these different facts point to a different Jesus (as it is her assertion; onus of proof being on her).\n \n I look forward to your reply.

   "Well, obviously these are different people!\n\n Again, these are merely examples of the proponderence of people named Jesus. I also showed the commonality of the moniker \"Christ\". Given these, how does any of your \"evidence\" show the Gospel historical Christ, and not just any random person calling himself Jesus Christ or even the Messiah, of which there were many. \n \n \nWhat do we learn about Jesus and or Christianity from this historian/writer?\n\n If you honestly believe that any part of the passage is not forged. It is also possible that it was forged twice- once just to have Jesus' existence, and again to add the extremely obvious forgeries. However, the passage is absent from early copies of the works of Josephus and did not appear in Origen's third century version of Josephus, referenced in his Contra Celsum. The first mention of this passage, as I said before, is from Bishop Eusebius, a known forger. How is any part of the passage to be taken as authentic under these circumstances?\n \n \nShe needs to show that each of these different facts point to a different Jesus (as it is her assertion; onus of proof being on her).\n\n Clearly you misunderstand the usage of burden of proof. If one person is arguing that something exists, and another that the thing does not, it is up to the person arguing the former to provide the evidence. Nonexistence can't be proven. I can't ever prove that Jesus Christ of the Gospels did not exist, just as I can't prove that unicorns or anything else did not exist. You are the one arguing that there was a historical person who corresponds to the Gospel Christ. I am arguing that this remains unproven. And so it does.\n \n \nJosephus ends up being a rich source for confirmation of the Gospel record:\n\n Well, since you brought it up, there is the further problem that the entire Gospel makes no sense. \n \n 1. Though this person supposedly lived during one of the most heavily documented periods in ancient history, and went about \"attracting multitudes\" everywhere he went, he goes completely unmentioned by his contemporary historians. The only written remarks historicists can find are either part or whole forgeries, depending on who you talk to. Why are there no un-forged references to the historical Gospel Christ? Or even to a Christ who differs in some ways from Gospel accounts, but in others is similar? Why the silence on this supposed remarkable historical figure, when so much information is available on other figures, such as Simon Magus, or John the Baptist, or even Pontius Pilate? \n \n 2. Everything written about Jesus' biography, from the virgin birth in a manger to the blood sacrifice, are found in stories of Gods and leaders for millenia before his supposed birth. Jesus' titles, including \"the Christ\", Son of God, the Good Shepard, the Light of the World, etc., are also taken from other gods. Early Christian apologists argued that the devil had written these to lead the faithful astray. I hope you can come up with a better one. \n \n 3. Early Christian writings seem to speak of a mythical or spiritual Christ, not a historical one. In fact, instead of details being lost or muddled over time (as one would expect with a historical figure), the story becomes more detailed and more \"historical\" as we move further away from the time it is supposed to have happened. Strange....\n \n 4. There are references to Early Christians which suggest that their God was no more human than the pagans'. They also strangely refrain from using the historicity of Jesus or anything bibliographical about his as argument, instead arguing only that he is \"as real as pagan gods\"- but not more so. \n \n 5. At the time that Joseph and the pregnant Mary are said to have gone off to Bethlehem for a supposed Roman census, Galilee (unlike Judaea) was not a Roman province and therefore ma and pa would have had no reason to make the journey. Even if Galilee had been imperial territory, history knows of no 'universal census' ordered by Augustus (nor any other emperor) - and Roman taxes were based on property ownership not on a head count. \n \n 6. Even without a spurious census, the city of Nazareth did not exist until the second century. when we look for historical confirmation of this hometown of a god - surprise, surprise! - no other source confirms that the place even existed in the 1st century AD.\n \n \u0095 Nazareth is not mentioned even once in the entire Old Testament. The Book of Joshua (19.10,16) - in what it claims is the process of settlement by the tribe of Zebulon in the area - records twelve towns and six villages and yet omits any 'Nazareth' from its list.\n \n \u0095 The Talmud, although it names 63 Galilean towns, knows nothing of Nazareth, nor does early rabbinic literature.\n \n \u0095 St Paul knows nothing of 'Nazareth'. Rabbi Solly's epistles (real and fake) mention Jesus 221 times, Nazareth not at all.\n \n \u0095 No ancient historian or geographer mention Nazareth. It is first noted at the beginning of the 4th century.\n \n \n'Never heard of the place' - Josephus\n In his histories, Josephus has a lot to say about Galilee (an area of barely 900 square miles). During the first Jewish war, in the 60s AD, Josephus led a military campaign back and forth across the tiny province. Josephus mentions 45 cities and villages of Galilee - yet Nazareth not at all.\n Josephus does, however, have something to say about Japha (Yafa, Japhia), a village just one mile to the southwest of Nazareth where he himself lived for a time (Life 52).\n A glance at a topographical map of the region shows that Nazareth is located at one end of a valley, bounded on three sides by hills. Natural access to this valley is from the southwest.\n Before the first Jewish war, Japha was of a reasonable size. We know it had an early synagogue, destroyed by the Romans in 67 CE (Revue Biblique 1921, 434f). In that war, it's inhabitants were massacred (Wars 3, 7.31). Josephus reports that 15,000 were killed by Trajan's troops. The survivors - 2,130 woman and children - were carried away into captivity. A one-time active city was completely and decisively wiped out.\n Now where on earth did the 1st century inhabitants of Japha bury their dead? In the tombs further up the valley!\n With Japha's complete destruction, tomb use at the Nazareth site would have ended. The unnamed necropolis today lies under the modern city of Nazareth.\n At a later time - as pottery and other finds indicate(see below) - the Nazareth site was re-occupied. This was after the Bar Kochba revolt of 135 CE and the general Jewish exodus from Judea to Galilee. The new hamlet was based on subsistence farming and was quite unrelated to the previous tomb usage by the people of Japha.\n\n \n None of this would matter of course if, rather like at the nearby 'pagan' city of Sepphoris, we could stroll through the ruins of 1st century bath houses, villas, theatres etc. Yet no such ruins exist.\n \n 7. If you follow a star, you will go around in a circle. \n \n 8. The first versions of Mark end with the women fleeing an empty tomb- the resurrection segment is a later addition. \n \n 9. The Gospel version of Pilate, the trial, and the execution of Jesus makes no historical sense, and is inconsistent even in the four books. The charge of \"blasphemy\" did not exist in Roman court (\"treason\" did)- claiming to be God was not illegal by any stretch, people did it all the time. Pilate historically seldom bothered to have trials, let alone agonized over an individual execution the way he does in the Gospels. And so on...\n \n 10. The Emperor Hadrian refers to Alexandrian worshippers of the sun-god Serapis calling themselves 'Bishops of Christ'. (Hadrian to Servianus, 134A.D.) His worshippers built him horned altars, such as the one described in 1 Kings 1:50.\n \n 11. The supposed \"12 apostles\" do not add up. First, they are contradictory from one book to the next, second they do not correspond to the people mentioned in the Gospels, nor do they make sense if you believe that the Gospels writers were apostles.\n \n 12. The four books are contradictory, not complementary. If one is to be believed, the other must be false- for example does Jesus go into the desert for fourty days immediately after baptism (Mark 1.12,13), or does he go to a wedding (John 1.32;43: 2.1.2)? He can't possibly have done both, if he was a historical person.\n \n I'm going to stop at twelve, but there are many more problems and contradictions. Of course, none of this is problematic if you contend that Jesus is mythological- in myth anything is possible. History is much less forgiving.",

   "Wow, that's a whole lot of postin'!\n Some folks just have more time on their hands than others. emoticon_xbouncer \n \n Well, I won't post a huge amount of stuff to try to support my feeble claims, but here goes anyway:\n \n I believe that Jesus (or Yashua) was a real person, and the account of his life in the Bible is generally accurate, as far as where he went, what he said, and how people reacted. I, of course, doubt all accounts of miracles and magic and such. (Unless Benny Hinn is the messiah.)\n \n But I do believe that Jesus was a great rabbi and leader of the Jewish people, that perhaps eventually his role in life became much bigger than he had anticipated. His take on morality and practices within the Jewish faith was radical and revolutionary, enough for his followers to form a new religion, since the beliefs were so different than those of the day.\n \n To me he seems more like Ghandi and MLK of 2000 years ago. It's just that 2000 years ago, people were more inclined to believe in magic and mysticism, and were more likely to place supernatural attributes upon great leaders.\n \n I'm sorry if some may take that as a criticism of their beliefs. I do not intend it that way.\n \n Here are a few sites about the last statement:\n https://www.eisenbrauns.com/ECOM/_1A30UDD8C.HTM\n http://www.christianity-books.com/The_Original_Jesus_The_Life_and_Vision_of_a_Revolutionary_0802842836.html\n \n So maybe if Ghandi or MLK were living 2000 years ago we'd be discissing Ghandianity or Kingity.",

   "All very nice, apathy, but where is your evidence that such a person existed? Ghandi and MLK are clearly historical persons- even if you didn't have the modern conveniences of film and photographic records, the written records of their existence is very well documented. It helps that we're talking last century, but nonetheless, as I said, there is so much documentation of other persons from the supposed time period of Jesus Christ. How do you explain the dearth of records regarding him?",
