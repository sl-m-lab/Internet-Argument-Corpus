Her books grossly distort any opposition to make everyone seem stupid,and her philosophy seem fantastic.\n \n \n The entire basis of her philsophy is largely a combination of Ethical egoism, which is hardly an ethical philsophy insomuch that college curriculums rarely cover it--They cover ethical relativism more than that, it's so pathetic, and Rights-Based ethics.\n \n Rights, while very good and in many cases, Utilitarian, do not stand up on their own. Rights can, however, stem from Moral DUties, but of course she ignores any of this and calls everyone else imbeciles.\n She and her followers are largely a cult. and Rand is its messiah.\n \n \n The majority of all educated, credible scholars and philsophers agree that she's intellecutally dishonest, non-credible, and bogus.\n \n Randroids are largely among the uneducated, the easily fooled.\n She is batshitt insane. \n \n The idea that she named her Philosophy \"objectivism\" is hilarious irony, since it's far from \"objective.\" She even goes so far as to state a \"perfect\" form of Art, and that only \"her\" philsophy is the right way. Not only is there a right and wrong morality, there is a right and wrong to everything, according to one of her books--I believe her book on art and asthetics.\n \n \n Her philosophy, since it was taken over by Supreme Overlord Peikoff, has gotten even worse. It is completely impervious to change or alteration, and anyone who has any differences of opinion or modifications is signaled out and exiled: for example, take a student and former ARI member, Kelly. \n \n Kelly was kicked out of the organization for trying to fix the stagnation of Objectivism, saying it ought to be an open system. INstead of adapting, it became like a religion--a closed system, as Peikoff once said. There is to be no change, for Objectivism is the \"truth.\" Which is silly.\n \n The antagonists are usually weak, pathetic, full of uncertainty, and lacking in imagination and talent. In addition, the novels are alleged to contain errors or omissions in terms of the reality of social interactions, economics, technology, and history.",

   "newbie here; \n \n I find it interesting how many people answer with some version of religion, or \"attitude\" to life, or one or another modus vivendi\n \n philosophy is not religion, although I acknowledge there is a philosophy OF religion (it's called Theology, i think). And, imo, Philosophy is much more more than an attitude. It helps me arrive at a way of living, but hardly comprises it.\n \n for the record, I'm a Cartesian; cogito ergo sum were the last words to make sense in the western philosophic tradition, imo \n \n Philosophy is a serious discourse with a long and beautiful history.\n \n Is this a serious forum or just the usual bunch of 1/2 (if that) educated American know nothings with typing skills and time on their hands?",

   "While Rand is a good author, she isn't a good Philosopher. SHe is largely guilty of what academics calls \"pseudo-philosophy\" and \"pseudo-morality.\" Rand, instead of putting her ideas into a credible peer reviewed journal, decided to cop-out and form her own little clan of pseduo-philosophers, totally bypassing legimiate academics. ...\n \n\n \n Your post is mostly ridicule  and appeal to authority. Peer-review? LMAO! Ethics is not something handed down to us by academic authorities (or supernatural authorities for that matter). Frankly, I'm glad Rand was a public intellectual engaged in moral discourse with her fellow citizens. \n \n Rand has many important things to say. Sometimes I agree; sometimes I dont'. But I give her credit where credit is due. I suggest people read her and judge for themselves. Don't wait for peer-review before living your life! LOL.",

IMO, as good a place as any to mark the jumping of place where rationalism separated from theist (religious) medeival philosophic tradition.\n \n He was arguably the first existentialist....the tradition I most align with personally.\n \n cogito ergo sum was his famous quote (in Latin). translation: \"I think therefore I am\"\n \n This was his answer to the fundamental question of ontology (existence); i.e. \"How do I know I exist?\" I don't think he ever got around to the 2nd question of ontology: Why do I exist?\n \n I just said it was \"last words to make sense......., to be a smartass and because much of what follows in the Continental Phil. tradition is SO complicated and arcane..(including Kant, imo)..few ever summed up their though so succintly as did Renes.\n \n Descartes was also famous as the author of the Mind/Body problem, usually referred to as dualism.\n \n Yes, I see from the posts this looks like a good place....i was afraid it might be over run by bible thumpers, like so much else these days.\n \n cheers...",

(ala Demosthenes) :) \n \n Of course u r correct. I like the Continentals, even if I can't understand a word they are saying. IMO, u can bracket all of western philosophy between Renes and Ludwig Wittgenstein. So my weak attempt at humor. cheers",
