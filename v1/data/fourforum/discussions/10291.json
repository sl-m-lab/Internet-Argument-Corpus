But, my only problem is that the wacko's seem to be the sqeeky wheels in this day and age. They are the well-funded minority that think they speak for the majority. \n\n \n Well, I think there are two reasons for this. One is that the message, by it's very nature of being radical, tends to stand out and has a certain amount of 'shock' value. It draws attention.\n \n Two, because of the sensational nature of the message of extremists, the news media (ALL of it) tends to like it. They love it when people like Pat Robertson make an outlandish statement, because it's great for ratings and business. It gets more hits to the news websites and people tune in. \n \n If the media didn't make it a story every time someone like Robertson made a big statement, the RR would lose it's teeth, PR-wise. The irony here is that the liberal media (and make no mistake, it IS mostly liberal), are the ones fueling the extremism of the right by giving them press due to the sensational nature of the statements.\n \n \nAnd this is why, I believe, gay people and their supporters push back so hard against the right; thereby lumping all christians under the same tent. No, it's not fair to do it. But it is an understandable reaction to some pretty nasty stuff thrown at us.\n \n ..... So, THEY are to many of us, unfortunately, the face of christianity.\n\n \n Wanton inaccuracy is never 'understandable'. It doesn't take a lot of effort to apply reason and refuse to generalise. I really do think that the same problem of the sensationalism of extremism exists among gay rights proponents as well. If someone says 'religion should be eradicated' (sentiments that have been expressed by some right here on these forums) it too is an extremist statement and tends to \"stand out.\" No, it doesn't make the news because the media doesn't care as much about such statements (with some exceptions, e.g. Chris Hitchens' interviews), but the statements sure stand out to religious people who know better than to think that the eradication of religion is the solution to the gay rights problem.\n \n In fact, if you were to somehow eradicate religion, you'd probably guarantee gays NEVER getting equal rights. Think about it--most cases of equal rights being granted has come about because of the support of religion and it's benevolent adherents. It's no coincidence that people like ML King Jr. were devout Christians, or that the abolitionist movement of the 19th century largely came out of churches. The solution to the gay rights problem isn't to get rid of religion, or oppose it, but to win it over. To strengthen your ties to it somehow, with a growing number of people who are less concerned with opposing homosexuality. The answer is IN the churches, not apart from them.",

   "Well, I think there are two reasons for this. One is that the message, by it's very nature of being radical, tends to stand out and has a certain amount of 'shock' value. It draws attention.\n \n Two, because of the sensational nature of the message of extremists, the news media (ALL of it) tends to like it. They love it when people like Pat Robertson make an outlandish statement, because it's great for ratings and business. It gets more hits to the news websites and people tune in. \n \n If the media didn't make it a story every time someone like Robertson made a big statement, the RR would lose it's teeth. The irony here is that the liberal media (and make no mistake, it IS mostly liberal), are the ones fueling the extremism of the right by giving them press due to the sensational nature of the statements.\n\n \n I can agree to some of what you said. The people on both sides of these hot button issues are truly the pawns of a rather strange news media junkie culture. I think a big myth is this \"liberal\" media bias thing. The plethora of conservative news shows on Fox (where's the liberal side there?), Scarborough, Tucker the XXXXXX carlsen, etc., Rush Dumbaugh .. CBN etc. Where's the \"liberal\" media? CNN? MSNBC? no, they're just the players searching for ratings. OK, something like the NY Times and Washington Post, sure, they're liberal. But, if Fox is the most watched news program, how is there a liberal bias? Just because the conservatives, lately, haven't done a whole helluva lot of good and are ridden in scandal, does it mean that reporting the facts is a liberal bias? There aren't a lot of liberal commentators that have their own show on the news networks. Are there any? I think you need to take an honest look at the this whole \"liberal\" media thing. I personally don't see it as liberal or conservative. I see it as an entertainment business. They're just searching for polarizing stories to polarize people to get stellar ratings and more sponsors. \n \n \nWanton inaccuracy is never 'understandable'. It doesn't take a lot of effort to apply reason and refuse to generalise. I really do think that the same problem of the sensationalism of extremism exists among gay rights proponents as well. If someone says 'religion should be eradicated' (sentiments that have been expressed by some right here on these forums) it too is an extremist statement and tends to \"stand out.\" No, it doesn't make the news because the media doesn't care as much about such statements (with some exceptions, e.g. Chris Hitchens' interviews), but the statements sure stand out to religious people who know better than to think that the eradication of religion is the solution to the gay rights problem.\n\n \n Well, I am not justifying what a over-zealous gay rights activist says about religion, because I, for one, don't need that type of hysteria to help me clarify my relationship with a higher power. But, I will say in any type of activism, there is an in-you-face stance that tends to happen at the beginning of any movement. For example, ACT UP, in the 80s, did a lot of good work bring AIDS to the forefront. Their actions were pretty aggressive; however, it was, at that time in recent history, a necessary movement to create awareness of a HUGE problem and REAL fast. Now? They've broken into two factions. One still a bit militant, one more reaching out to the community. There will be always the \"fringe\" zealots on both sides of the aisle. I have to look at where the \"eradication\" statements were made. I think more people here believe in... practice your faith, believe in what you want, but don't let your chosen beliefs in your religion dictate our secular human rights. Many christians think that is eradication. I see it as separation of church and state. (I for one can't stand Christopher Hitchens. I saw an interview of him and caught him in two lies. And he was drunk! He just seems like a really bitter queen that hasn't been xxxx for too long a time.)\n \n \nIn fact, if you were to somehow eradicate religion, you'd probably guarantee gays NEVER getting equal rights. Think about it--most cases of equal rights being granted has come about because of the support of religion and it's benevolent adherents. It's no coincidence that people like ML King Jr. were devout Christians, or that the abolitionist movement of the 19th century largely came out of churches. The solution to the gay rights problem isn't to get rid of religion, or oppose it, but to win it over. To strengthen your ties to it somehow, with a growing number of people who are less concerned with opposing homosexuality. The answer is IN the churches, not apart from them.\n\n \n Well, it depends on what religious faction you are talking about. I think that it comes down to two camps. The literalists and the ones that can think for themselves. MLK was a man that could think for himself. I mean, look at our own Jimmy Carter. Devout Baptist. But he has broken away from the fundamentalist interpretations and is trying to reclaim the inclusory faith that he has always believed the Baptist religion to be. The Episcopals are having so many problems because of the hypocritical, polygamist, conservative, uneducated African coningent. Literalists... can't think for themselves. I have many Episcopal, gay friends. I can see how important their faith is to them, and I support them in it. They are always debating what different parts of the bible mean. They have dragged me to church on many occassions. All that high-mass stuff kind of bores me though. (I grew up a catholic altar boy, been there done that). \n \n But, I think it's not so much homosexuals embracing religion, but religion embracing homosexuals. Remember, we're the ones that were shunned first. We didn't lose our faith in christianity and then turn gay. It's just insulting to go to a church where some spiritual neophyte comes up and says, \"I hate your lifestyle choice, but I love you.\" ... and if you believe that, I have a piece of property to sell you right in the middle of manhattan! It's just so insulting and disprespectful.\n \n But, I agree, it would be better to have Christians on our side. But in order to win them over, they have to open the door first with an open mind.",

   "They are also responsible for the various other things like the recent Minnesota bridge collapse.\n\n \n Sooooo - the fact that there have been structural problems since it was built and all the extra weight due to construction equipment was irrelevant. I'll call up the city and tell them to stop the investigation! Who needs analysis when there is scapegoating to be done!\n \n \nYes, I do. Many of the ones in the ollapse were likely gays. emoticon_xkill \n\n \n My son and his gay dad were supposed to be on that bridge at that time but ended up leaving for the cabin late. And although it is possible there were gays in the collapse, none of those who died were. There was mother and her toddler daughter, a couple of dads, a mother and her disabled son and a woman on her way to teach traditional dance at church. So if your God was gunning for gays - he missed the mark big-time. Why not just zap the Gay 90s or the Saloon downtown? Can't the almighty manage some accuracy? \n \n \n \n On a side note; I am not a Christian but have read the Bible in its entirety and get utterly annoyed when those who do claim to be Christians can't get the basics of their own faith right. God stopped backing nations/groups after Isreal. That was the whole point of the messiah. Its up to individuals to choose whether or not to come to him through Christ. If one chooses not to come to him, he will deal with that individual on judgement day. He is not out punishing whole nations for not following along anymore. As a matter of fact - after taking Isreal as his people - - they were the only ones that got nailed anyway - - because they were his people. But please, don't take my word for it - READ THE BIBLE.",
