They attended Sunday's service with their lawyer and many supporters....\n \n His actions also drew criticism from other Baptist clergymen in the town.\n \n \"This is very disturbing,\" the Rev. Robert Prince III, who leads the congregation at the nearby First Baptist Church, said Saturday. \"I've been a pastor for more than 25 years, and I have never seen church members voted out for something like this.\"\n\n \n http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=519&ncid=519&e=6&u=/ap/20050508/ap_on_re_us/church_politics\n \n He should resign.
