   "So there were no Hurricanes in the years 1907 and 1914. They didn't start naming hurricanes until the 1950's and they didn't start giving them guys names until 1979 or 1980. (I saw one hurricanes name was Fifi.) Can it be dangerous to name a hurricane human names (or pet names)? Would people get out faster if they were given more scary names like maybe Huricane Prediter, Hurricane Apocolypse, Hurricane Armageddon, Hurricane Termonater, Hurricane Jar-Jar Binks (Hey, that might scare some of the inhabitants away faster than the others :p which by the way, I got from movie titles.)\n Also, did anyone notice any kind of pattern in years and hurricanes from year to year? I thought I did but then I lost it. So did anyone notice any patterns that seem to be more than just coincidents?",

I also noticed that as the years progressed that the hurricanes were getting stronger. I love your naming system hurricane preditor lol :) emoticon_xgood",

Meterologist do have to have higher levels of math then anyone should be forced to take in their lifetime. And yes, there is a certin mathmatics to weather. Do I know what it is? Not personally, but then again, I'm not a meterologist. Hey, if anyone on the 4forums is a meterologist, maybe they can prove my statement wrong a teach me something at the same time.emoticon_smile",

And yeah, they probably did use reports from ships, and later planes. It might be dangerous, but less dangerous overall than having untracked storms surprising the shipping lanes.",
