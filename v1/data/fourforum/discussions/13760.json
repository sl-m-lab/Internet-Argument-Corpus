Was in the delayed entry program for a year while in high school thus obtaining the rank of E-2 after basic.\n \n I graduated basic training on ironically September 11, 2006. Needless to say it was one of the proudest moments of my life... If Archie needs some evidence I'll gladly post a photo of me and my entire family that day visiting Great Lakes..\n \n I underwent Intel Specialist training at Dam Neck Virginia. Afterwords I was assigned to PCD Mesa Verde LPD 19 stationed in Norfolk Virginia. I then was transferred with the rest of the crew to where the ship was actually built in Pascagoula Mississippi and underwent shipboard training and other various tasks for the commission of the ship.\n I am an original Plank owner for this vessel and was part of the original commissioned crew.\n \n After Christmas leave is when the attack took place. I was transferred to shore command at Naval Station Norfolk and spent 8 months on shore duty before being honorably discharged on August 14, 2008.\n\n \n Thanks you for the explanation.

I'm still trying to obtain them personally and for some reason the VA cannot locate them...\n \n Assumed? No Archie they did NOT assume for fun.... There was deep seeded hatred...\n \n XXXXXXXX. I said I felt that camaraderie not they. I felt shocked and betrayed that people would do this to their own fellow Sailors and brothers in arms... Don;t believe me that these attacks are real? Read about August Provost or other Seaman killed for being Gay...\n \n Your a liar and a fool.... JUST because my views are different than yours gives you NO right to question my patriotism....\n \n It's the same mindset you share for us all Archie. Just because I stand up for who I am and squarely face your stupidity and prejudice in all it's form just makes me a direct target for your malice...\n \n He was not. However he was an E-5 or a petty officer second class therefor he had seniority. Also, I bunked and berthed with these other people so they had direct access to me and where I lived...\n \n Smell test? Archie if someone put an odor in front of you and it was different from what you THINK it should smell you'd deny it till you were blue in the face... The same goes for your beliefs...\n \n Nice try? I do not have to explain anything to you! If anything I can say he was very effeminate. I however was not. I believe word got around possibly through him or rumors that I was gay and these people enacted upon it. If you forget which you often do, I was still in the closet even to myself at the time.....\n \n Version? Perhaps you would like to question my attackers? Or rather pin a metal on their chest? \n \n Yes they do because you discredit my service and dishonor three generations of my family that have fought for this nation. You discredit and make a mockery out of an incident that will haunt me for the rest of my life. You have not a clue of the trials I face daily...\n \n Perhaps you want to read the VA reports concerning my Post Traumatic Stress Disorder? Perhaps you'd like to watch my many restless nights to where I wake up in cold sweats or my mood swings where I lash out at others in an inexplicable manner due to my own inner turmoil...\n \n I do not need to share any of this with anyone but perhaps you will better understand that this is real and true and not a fantasy or fabrication.... But you do not care. All you care about is scoring points for your own grim self satisfaction.\n \n And going so far as to discredit my service and my heart and where it lies in loyalty to my creator, my country, and my soul is the greatest form of debauchery I can even think of..... \n \n Fool.... narrow minded carrion picking fool.... It was honorable due to medical conditions. Once my command found out WHY I was beaten they gave me two choices.\n \n One keep quiet and get an honorable discharge so the command saves face, or I get kicked out under DADT and get nothing.... I chose the latter.\n \n Think about it. A brand new command with a brand new warship having attacks within their own crew a mere 3 weeks after commission... Think about it and how that would tarnish the ship and the crew.... But you don't think only try to conjure up ways to spread spin and lies about other people you loathe, that much is clear...\n\n \n I find you to be a pathetic and dishonest excuse of a human being, not to mention a spiritually blind reprobate. And one who can't be trusted in any way. I have no reason to believe anything you say about any aspect of this alleged service and the ensuing drama. And with that said, I take no issue with any past generations of your family line which may have served.

   "Archie...\n \n You might possibly be the single most vile person I have ever encountered here on the forums Archie. What you have said in this thread is nothing short of rediculously offensive, and I for one sincerely think you owe JJ an appology. I find your comments offensive as a human being, an American, and a veteran. Shame on you. Do you excuse rapists as well if the victim was wearing a short skirt? If I beat a christian to death based on the fact that he was carrying a bible, could I claim that I was provoked, and he shared at least some of the blame? Rediculous. \n \n Funny, for a person who claims to be a christian, you don't seem to know too much about christ or his teachings.\n\n \n The fact is that we have been told a story by an anonymous person who goes by the name jazyjason, and nothing more at this point. I have no reason to believe anything this guy has said, and in no way am obligated to believe his version of events regarding this alleged beat down. For all I know it's a complete work of fiction designed to garner more sympathy for homosexuals who do nothing but claim a victim status by the mean straights. \n \n But I've also been around long enough to know that each story has two versions to it, and we have only heard the version from the loser who is obviously bitter and wants to justify the attack at all cost. In one sentence he speaks about the honor and camaraderie of soldiers, then he calls these so called attackers ignorant rednecks. What if they were actually honorable soldiers who didn't confront jason, but responded to something he did with justification which explains why he was drummed out of the military. All we have is his word that they were convicted of anything at all, but surely no evidence of it since this is just a story on an internet forum by a totally anonymous kid.\n So you can think anything you like about me snakespit, I welcome the condemnation from you as it means nothing because once again in case you missed it, this is a totally virtual yet anonymous reality. In other words, it isn't the real world. When Jason supplies real world evidence that anything he has said is in fact true, real and happened, and that the alleged culprits were convicted of a crime, then I will apologize profusely for not being sensitive to his trauma.",

Anything else you want to know? Social Security number? Blood type? It's A negative jackass.\n \n \n I have no reason to believe anything this guy has said, and in no way am obligated to believe his version of events regarding this alleged beat down. \n\n \n Then don't! But don't drum up your own version of fantasy to appease yourself of your own narrow minded zealous ideals!\n \n \nFor all I know it's a complete work of fiction designed to garner more sympathy for homosexuals who do nothing but claim a victim status by the mean straights. \n\n \n Yes yes an entire work of fiction. BECAUSE GAYS DON\"T GET BEAT UP IT IS ALL A FANTASY A GIANT CONSPIRACY....... keep thinking that...\n \n \n \n \nBut I've also been around long enough to know that each story has two versions to it, and we have only heard the version from the loser who is obviously bitter and wants to justify the attack at all cost. \n\n \n Loser? Bitter? Justify? How in the hell am I justifying my own attack? Are you that damned crazy Archie? And I certainly am bitter! PTSD does not go away XXXXX. But it's OK I'll put my fiddle away back in it's case......\n \n \n \nIn one sentence he speaks about the honor and camaraderie of soldiers, then he calls these so called attackers ignorant rednecks.\n\n \n When did I call them ignorant rednecks? And it's one thing to be brothers fighting for a noble cause fighting against the enemies of this country and protecting our freedoms. It's a whole other issue beating someone because their different #$%hole.\n \n \n \n What if they were actually honorable soldiers who didn't confront jason, but responded to something he did with justification which explains why he was drummed out of the military. \n\n \n HAVE YOU HEARD NOTHING?? I NEVER MADE A PASS AT THEM EARTH TO ARCHIE. AND EVEN IF I DID THAT GIVES THEM NO RIGHT TO ATTACK SOMEONE TO THE POINT OF DEATH. GET IT THROUGH YOUR THICK XXXXING SKULL\n \n \n \nAll we have is his word that they were convicted of anything at all, but surely no evidence of it since this is just a story on an internet forum by a totally anonymous kid.\n\n \n Kid? I'm 21 an adult and have my own ideals. XXXX off Archie.\n \n \n \nSo you can think anything you like about me snakespit, I welcome the condemnation from you as it means nothing because once again in case you missed it, this is a totally virtual yet anonymous reality.\n\n \n The only virtual reality is the one bubbling inside your head....\n \n \n In other words, it isn't the real world. When Jason supplies real world evidence that anything he has said is in fact true, real and happened, and that the alleged culprits were convicted of a crime, then I will apologize profusely for not being sensitive to his trauma.\n\n \n I don't want your apology. I don;t need it and it just proves my point altogether. You never we're and never will be a Christian Archie. Your self absorbed religion festers from your black heart into a cesspool of decayed frail fringe lunacy.\n \n The only thing human about you is the festering hate and pride in your heart for those different than you.",
