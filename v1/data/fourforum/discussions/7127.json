   "Here is my question on pedophiles...\n And for the record, I'm not defending any actions.\n In our society, if a guy who is older than 21 (even up to 31 or 41...) and likes a girl who is 17, that is not only weird, but it is also illegal. But say the day is June 25th (for example) and the girls birthday is June 26th. In one day, she will be 18. It is then legal (though the older the man the still a little weird) for the guy to have a dating type relationship with her. Now of course it has to be consensual but now the idea is legal and no one will get into trouble or really be considered weird. This is actually more so that the guy is 31 or so. It's wrong for the 31 year old man to try and pursue a 17 year old girl but one day later, it's completely legal.\n Now why is one day here all the difference that is really needed?\n Why is the girl more considered ready for a relationship with an older man in just one days time?\n Also, why is the guy considered more mature (or experienced) at ages higher than 21?\n \n Once again, this is pure questioning and not me trying to defend some action of my own.\n \n Oh, and if anyone decides to quote me on something, plese either bold the specific line you want to quote me on or just shorten it and use what you want.",

   "Well, it's like all similar situations. You don't become suddenly mature on your birthday, but some fixed limits need to be set, so a general limit is set. How the legislators determine the years, I don't know. The last line is supposed to be 28, when the personalty is fully formed, while the first fixed point is 2 years, when the basic personality forms.\n \n Also, you may note that while statutory rape allows for such strange situations, society generally frowns on relationships where the age difference becomes too great. Think about it, would you, by default, believe that the marriage between an 80 year old and a 20 year old had anything to do with love and nothing with inheritances?",

Until we can devise a test the will be able to determine when someone is mature enough to make sexual decisions on their own, we have to draw a line, somewhat arbitrarily, and say that anyone older than that probably is mature enough to make up their own minds, and anyone younger probably isn't. Their birthday is a convientient place to put that line. Laws require strict definitions, so there's got to be some definite cut off point.

But in the US, while this would seem weird to some, it would not be illegal. But there are quite a few times when a woman marries a much older man. But I'm not as much talking about marriage as a relationship (that has the ability to lead to a marriage but may not necessarily be) or even a liking. Now, it's okay for a guy who is 32 to have a relationship with a girl at the age of 27. (That's a five year difference.) For a guy who is 22 to even like (in that way) a girl who is 17 is either illegal or suggest a psychological problem. Then on the girls 18th birthday, it's completely legal and the guy is healthy. This goes with the idea that a girl who is 17 or younger knows nothing and a guy who is 21 or older knows everything.\n Oh, and the situation (which I have heard) can be turned around in which the woman is much older than the guy. But also, at the same time, depending on the state, and with the parents consent, a guy can get married to a girl who is 14. But if they have any children, the guy can get arrested for pedophilia.",

   "aaah, pedophiles.\n those hopeless romantics, who are so full of love they can't help but get a little of it on ya.\n \n the reason such a situation (as in the original post) is considered 'wrong' or 'wierd' is because of a monogomous mating instinct that, if it isn't natural, is at the very least cultural: we're bred to think that sex means one person until you die- which hopefully is about the same time that the other person dies, so you can go to heaven together (I have no idea where this came from , it's not christian despite many people thinking it is, but there you have it).\n \n the problem is, when you have a large age range- of say, upwards of 7-10 years in a relatively young couple (as in the one described), you not only have that instinct saying \"this isn't gonna work\" from the cultural standpoint, you have an instinct for saying \"this isn't gonna work\" because the only similar situations many of us can think of is with old rich men who are about to die and who marry young models who want their fortune, in a sham of a relationship based entirely on good sex (and even then entirely from his perspective) .\n \n these types of relationships last only a short time when the only people involved are the same age- which many of us have observed first or second hand. when the age and maturity difference is so great, as it is here, subconcious alarms go off saying \"this is going to end badly!\" and we immediately stop to watch someone else crash and burn, or (for those of religious or moral conviction) try to keep them from crashing and burning- generally by seperating them.",
