   "N.Y., Calif. target \"gay panic\" defense\n \n SUMMARY: Inspired in part by last month's brutal attack on Kevin Aviance, lawmakers look for ways to discourage the \"gay panic\" defense in criminal courts. \n \n Lawmakers in California and New York are looking for ways to discourage the \"gay panic\" defense in criminal courts, an ugly phenomenon that may be impossible to eradicate through legislation.\n \n One thing they can do is to declare that the state's public policy frowns on the use of prejudice as a tool to influence juries. Both the California and New York proposals oblige criminal courts to read specific jury instructions, ordering the panel to avoid making decisions on the basis of bias against victims or witnesses.\n \n In California, the Gwen Araujo Justice for Victims Act has passed the Assembly, and also survived a 4-2 vote in the Senate Public Safety Committee late last month. The bill is now pending in the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n \n Sponsored by Assemblywoman Sally Lieber, D-Mountain View, the bill is named for the transgender teenage victim of a shocking murder in October 2002, when several young men beat and strangled the young woman after learning she was born male. The killers' lawyers argued, with some success, that the men were acting in a state of \"diminished capacity\" brought on by the revelation of Araujo's biological gender.\n \n In New York, Assemblyman Ruben Diaz Jr. introduced a measure based on the California bill in the wake of three anti-gay hate crimes in early June. The most prominent was the attack on singer Kevin Aviance, who wound up with a broken jaw, several fractures and numerous bruises after being bashed by a group of youths June 9.\n \n According to press reports, it appeared as if at least one of the suspects planned to say that the attack was provoked by Aviance, who made a pass at him -- the classic scenario in the \"gay panic\" defense.\n \n Under Diaz's bill, juries would be instructed as follows: \"Do not let bias, sympathy, prejudice, or public opinion influence your decision. Bias includes bias against the victim or victims or witness or witnesses based upon his or her race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability, gender identity or sexual orientation.\"\n \n The chances that a jury would actually be able to operate in such an emotional vacuum may be remote, but perhaps instructions like these would decrease the extent to which raw bias informs criminal verdicts.\n \n \"The truth is,\" said openly lesbian California state Sen. Carole Migden during the latest Senate hearing, \"hatred is taught. Intrinsically we permit it, in churches, in religious institutions. We can't pretend it ain't real. There is panic. There is revulsion. I think we have our work to do.\"\n http://news.yahoo.com/s/po/20060708/co_po/nycaliftargetgaypanicdefense",
