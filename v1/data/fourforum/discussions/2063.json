   "ok, i live in kansas which is currently going throught the motions of instituting a concealed carry law so i been thinking about it\n\n \n Welcome aboard! I am in Kansas too (near Emporia).\n \n I think Sebelius is going to veto it. I don't know if we have the votes to over ride the veto or not. I have heard rumors that Kerry is considering Sebelius for a running mate. All I can say is \"Take her and good riddance. We can't take much more of her math\".\n \n \nthere are 3 general ways to reduce crime\n 1. high penalties, example along time ago in arabia (could still be happening, i dont know) your right hand was chopped off for stealing, this punishment was even worse since the left hand is considered unclean and its an insult to your host to touch anything with it, everytime you would do anything in public you had to explain that you had been a thief.....this cannot be implemented well here in america\n\n \n Interestingly enough, that is because their left hand was the one they used to wipe. True.\n \n \n2. more police, enough to catch folks in the act, again, cannot be implemented costs too much money\n\n \n exactly\n \n \n3. prepare your citizens to deal with criminals, there are many ways martial arts can work, but take too much time and training, a concealed firearm is the quickest and easiest way to be ready. tear gas and tasers are alternatives but are not garunteed. a determined or high opponent can take a bullet to the heart and still kill the person shooting him/her, try to tell me that teargas would stop him/her\n\n \n 3 for 3! College must be doing you some good!\n \n \nnow i have gotten smarter, i will happily help society defend itself in a reasonably fair engagement, but the government has made certain that no one has a gun in public places, they disarmed me, so they are on their own\n\n \n Excellent point. On the one hand, it is good to keep people from getting killed. On the other hand, if somebody is going to die, I would prefer it not be me. \n \n \nan interesting note is this, after going through the exhaustive requirements the gov wants to ensure that you are a safe carryer, they still prevent you from carrying in certain areas, the proposed law disallows concealed carry in universities, schools, businesses that disallow it, and anywhere children congregate\n\n \n These conditions were put in place to placate the liberals. I don't think the bill would pass without them. While they absolutly fly in the face of common sense, especially since the measures called for in the new bill are actually stricter than those required of law officers in kansas, for some reason they make the liberals feel better. I don't think that there will be much of a problem with businesses that disalow it, except maybe in socialist Johnson County. This is Kansas, where most people can still at least find \"common sense\" in the dictionary. \n \n \nand why not in a university, people there are considered legal adults, after paying the money and doing the training, putting my fingerprints on record i would not be able to carry 70% of my time in public, the other time i work in a gun store, not like someone is going to rob them in daylight, seems criminals, even armed ones, avoid places saturated with guns, something to think about huh?\n \n Mathurin\n\n \n Yes, the university one is quite possibly the most nonsensical. I will never understand why people seem to think that the mere presence of a weapon makes it somehow more likely that there is going to be a problem. I have lots and lots of guns, right here at my house. Last year, the murder rate at my house was 0. I think that we can most likely maintain the same this year. \n \n What school are you at?",

It took a few minutes to figure out loading and unloading, and a few more to dissemble it. The hardest part was getting that top cover off, then it was intuitive.\n\n \n I have done a lot of international travelling, most of it ouside of europe, and a large portion of it in conflict zones. Wherever you go in the world where there is conflict, you will find the ever reliable AK-47. For years te russians ad chinese gave the things away. They were so popular that the company that built them (and still does to an extent) is going under becasue there are so many of them available ont he surplus market that you can pick them up in sub sahara africa for a $20 bill, including a dozen loaded magazines.\n \n To me, it just seems like it would be common sense to teach our armed forces to use the most popular assault weapon in the world. The M-16 is a good gun, but outside of the US military, and the militaries of nations friendly to the US, the M-16 is a pretty rare weapon. On the modern battlefield, if you bend over and pick up a dead mans weapon, there is a better than average chance that it will be an AK. IT is rediculous that our troops don;t learn to operate one in basic training.\n \n The Saiga 20 is pretty much an AK modified to fire 12 gauge rounds, so yes, it counts. IF you want to improve the performance of the Saiga, you can pop that puppy open in install a rubber bumper pad to speed up the cyclic rate (just like an Uzi). Add a 8 rd magazine and you have one of the better home defense weapons you will ever find (IMHO). THey make a Saiga 20K with a 16.5 inch barrel that would probably be even better than the 20 (which has a 23 inch barrel) for home defense since it would be a little more maneuverable in tight quarters (like a hallway).\n \n I have not had much chance to play with a Saiga. I assume that, since it is the same basic design as an AK, you could open the action, dump in a handful of sand, then load it and fire it just fine, like you can the AK.
