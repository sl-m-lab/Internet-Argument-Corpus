Does that make any rational sense at all to you? Of course not, yet here you are defending the terrorists actions against the guy who's single act proves that practitioners of islam are precisely what he accused them of being when he made his protest of burning a Quran.\n\n \n Crusaders, had bombs been invented I would bet they would have used them.\n \n \nDid I say we should quench moslems freedom of religion? Not at all! I just pointed out in no uncertain terms that your criticism of Sapp is quenching his freedom of speech.

Some don't. If he had a point do you think he acheived it? What was gained by what he did? Nothing he made a bold statement that he has no control over how it will be spread and understood. All he accomplished was to say FU to a bunch of easily manipulated people who are already non to pleased with us and handed Anti American propogandists one sweet piece of cake to serve up to anybody with ears.\n \n \nslam is a political organization that imprisons its followers through force and intimidation. It requires that they (moslems) stop what they are doing 5 times each day and forces them to repeat a repetitive prayer that commits them to bondage to a slavish and oppressive god under threat of torture and death through Sharia Law. And if you had half a brain, all of this would be as obvious to you as it is to me. emoticon_confused\n\n \n I agree with you, but not for the reasons you state, at least not all of them.
