   "Well, according Georgia Minister for Foreign Affairs Zaurabashvili announcement Georgia delivered weapons smugglers up to the States. I think that she is cunning. I suppose that by this report she tried to hush echo accident in States up. The fact is that not long ago US special services caught the deliver of uranium admittedly for acts of terrorism organizing in New-York subway. Moreover most of part this group was Georgians and Chechens of course. FBI sent commission to Georgia for investigation. And as a result of it US specialists revealed the loss of some container with nuclear matter from Georgia police deport (it was exhibit). As I know it was withdrawal last year from Chechens who was set free some time later. And now exhibit was lost. It will not surprise for me if exposed uranium in States can be it which lost in Georgia. I think that Georgia police participating in it! Because of corruption in Georgia take place.",
