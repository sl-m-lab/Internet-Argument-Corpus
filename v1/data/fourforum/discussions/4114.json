   "US causes troubles to EU\n America seems to have been not that fortunate recently. One can come to this conclusion when considering the latest events in Ukraine and Georgia where America was trying to bring to life its conception of \"Democracy\". First, let us speak about Ukraine. A promising plan of bringing Viktor Yushchenko to power got out of hand. Tis son'o'bitch failed to come to expectation of his American masters when he agreed to carry out the reformation of authorities whereby he proved his being too soft for a politician (not to speak of being president). Some politicians keep saying Viktor Yushchenko won't stay long at the position of Ukrainian president as his days in the land of living are numbered. For sure, the next Ukrainian president will be Yulia Timoshenko (who is now getting ready to be the Ukrainian prime minister), which is the worst option for Americans - an oligarch and criminal wanted by INTERPOL is not the best choice, indeed.\n As for Georgian president Mikhail Saakashvili, he also was a great disappointment for America. Sizeable investments brought almost no effect.\n Anyway, the Americans readily keep delivering \"velvet revolutions\" to the countries of the CIS. But first of all, \"velvet revolutions\" effect European Union. I wonder, whether Europeans are ready to pay the bill.",
