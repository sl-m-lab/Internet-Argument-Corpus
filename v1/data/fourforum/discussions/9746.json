And the link in the first post of this thread doesn't have anything.\n \n I don't have any problem with a day of silence as long as it doesn't disrupt things in the schools. School administrators will love it, if a lot of kids do it. It will mean less of telling them to quiet down.\n \n This does touch on a larger issue though. It seems that schools are one of the bigger battlegrounds there days over cultural acceptance of gays. Gay/straight alliances are getting more and more common in schools, and now this. It's interesting that the gay pride movement seems very interested in getting its message into the schools. At this point I don't think that's bad, and is probably a good thing. Teenagers can be notoriously cruel sometimes, and gay kids should be able to go to school and not face the torment of being made fun of or beaten up by peers. It really is a problem, and while I don't agree on the marriage issue (at least in terms of redefining it), no one should have to face violence and bullying. At the same time, ALL bullying is bad, regardless of the reasons.\n \n Keeping kids home over a day of silence is pretty silly; kids know what is going on. The AFA gets carried away sometimes; if they weighed in on it, then this is yet another case of that. A better way might be to have an AFA-sanctioned day of silence as a counter protest, on a different day.

It is inconceivable to me to dehumanize anyone just because I abhor their lifestyle. We would pray in private for such people and treat them with respect and befriend them. \n \n You do your son a great injustice by projecting hatred on all Christians, and blaming all Christians for what was done by some ignorant school bullies who MIGHT be cultural Christians at the very best.

   "I'm the one who has been constantly attacked by you, Archie baby, and that other creep. You are not a very friendly group, that's for sure.emoticon_confused\n\n \n This is at least the third time I have seen you post how unfriendly the group is. \n \n Why is it that you cannot simply say, I don't want to tell you how old I am. Is it possible that you are not able to own your own feelings. Instead, you feel attacked by everything anybody with a different position says.\n \n The point that I am making is that you really need to calm down and post arguments not attacks on the person. I asked your age because I legitimately wanted to know. I don't really care if you tell me or not. It makes little real difference to me. I was curious because your comments are not those that I would normally attribute to someone in their late 30s to 40s.\n \n If I am dealing with a teenager, then I might not use references when discussing things with you that you are not likely to have any fund of knowlege on. I might use different analogies so that I can communicate more clearly and not keep getting into these misunderstandings with you. I am trying to be responsible with my communication. If you are in your 40s then I would use a different set of analogies or examples as you will have lived through different kinds of history. a 40 something persron would understand information concerning, say Ford's ascension to the presidency and some of the difficulties that resulted due to the nature of how he got there. HOwever a younger person may need a different example as the intricacies would be lost on them.\n \n Seriously, take a chill pill and relax. You don't know a single person here. You will never see them in reality. What we think of you is largely irrelevant. Be yourself and relax. If you are uncomfortable sharing your age, perhaps you could be more general. I don't blame you if you don't want to give personally identifying info. I don't either.\n \n Huck",

   "Christians never hijacked a day of learning in school either, in order to promote our spiritual agenda. Maybe we should have in order to protest the abolishment of prayer in school or taking the pledge away. \n\n \n First of all you can pray in school as much as you like - you just can't lead everybody in prayer with you. They aren't all Christian. \n \n Secondly the pledge is still recited.\n \n \nAnd are you suggesting my daughters have been violent to gays, bullied gay kids, thrown a gay kid down and force fed them garbage ? To judge us so harshly and unfairly fills me with sorrow for the hate and bitterness you must be projecting on your own kids. Mine have been raised to love and respect all people.\n\n \n Maybe. I am telling you that this what pack of Catholic brats did to my son for having a gay father. One (much older and bigger kid) threatened him with violence if he ever saw his dad again so he spent months lieing about it to keep safe. He ended up feeling guilty for denying the father he loves, he started acting out and his grades dropped. When we got to the bottom of the matter I wanted to drop-kick that kid.\n \n And your message is part of the problem. You feed the beast that justifies the hate and the violence. Everytime you use words like reprobate or depraved. Everytime you falsely accuse these families of damaging yours. In the end it is YOU who is doing damage to MY family. So, yes, I hold you and those who speak, think and act as you on this matter culpable.\n \n \nAlso, I would bet you big money that IF someone actually did this to your kid,and I'm sorry if they did, that they weren't in any way true born again believers who knew Jesus personally as my family does. It is inconceivable to me to dehumanize anyone just because I abhor their lifestyle. We would pray in private for such people and treat them with respect and befriend them. \n\n \n You do not respect them,. Nothing you have ever said indicates respect. I have found you nothing but insulting towards people I love. \n \n \nYou do your son a great injustice by projecting hatred on all Christians, and blaming all Christians for what was done by some ignorant school bullies who MIGHT be cultural Christians at the very best. \n\n \n I don't do that. There are many Christians in my life. I don't blame them all. \n \n \nIt's your lack of understanding the change that takes place when one is born again that allows you to lump all people into the same package of Christianity when a cultural christian does something violent or just hurtful.\n\n \n I want nothing to do with Christianity. Period. Ever. Do as Paul instructed you and wipe the dust from you feet and quit proseletizing to me. Christianity burned its bridge with me long ago.",
