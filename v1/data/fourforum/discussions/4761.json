In terms of having killed people sure, but its a whole new ball game if Europe and the US goes to war.\n \n You are so far off...wow, must be an American.\n\n \n you are closer to the truth here than you realise. The US military is largely designed to re-fight WWII. While the ability to refight WWII and win is nice to have, it does very little good in present wars, wars we are likely to see in the near future, or any kind of defensive role.\n \n Our urban combat abilities are SORELY lacking. Many of our soldiers in Iraq recieved only a single day of urban combat training. Now we have bumoed it up to 2 (or 3, at certain bases). Our standard loadouts are about as bad as can be imagined for urban combat, and the M-16 is one of the worse weapons I can think of for the task of street fighting or building clearing.\n \n Part of the equipment problems are due to the way we do procurement, with procurement officers generally recieving cushy jobs with defense contractors after retirement. For the price of a minime and 2 M4's, we could provide every man in the squad with an Uzi (widely recognized as a superior weapon for short range encounters and building clearing) for urban combat. If we wanted to cut costs, we co7uld go with the chinese version, which is about half the cost of the israeli one and is an exact copy. \n \n We did not loose vietnam because we lost the political war at home. What a joke, when we ran out of vietnam, the enemies flag was flying over our embassy. We napalmed huge areas, used chemical weapons, burned villages. We stopped short of using nukes, and I don't think that was because of political pressure at home.\n \n We lost in vietnam because the enemy was better equipped, and their men were better trained to fight the type of war that was being fought. During the first 3/4 of the war, the majority of our soldier who died did so with empty rifles in their hands. They had been taught to put as much lead in the air as quickly as possible. Guys would literally lie behind cover and empty their rifles in the general direction of the enemy. They enemy would stay behind cover until our guys ran out of ammo, then wander up and shoot them. \n \n It was not until a general whose name escapes me at the moment (though I can feel it tickling the back of my head) did a study as to why our guys were being beaten so badly that the problem came to light. While putting up a wall of lead is not necessarily a bad idea on a conventional battlefield, where resupply is virtualluy unlimited, it is a **** poor idea when you are on patroll 50 miles from the nearest ammo crate. That general reported the problem (which led to the development of 3 round burst in the M-16) and ordered that his men NOT use the automatic setting on their rifles. HE even went so far as to say that, since his men did not use automatic fire, anybody who WAS using FA was obviously the enemy and should be shot. \n \n The problem int he Us military and how it is equipped is that we are not likely to see another WWII. We need light, effective combat units who are able to adapt to various situations and not rely on constant resupply. We also need troops who are combat effective at an individual level and are not wholly reliant on our neat toys, gadgets, and vehicles. A us military unit is currently extremely combat effective, as long as they have a billion dollars worth of equipment and armoured vehicles. At the basest level of combat, which is a man on the ground, on foot, with a rifle, which is what you see in urban combat (since tank killing in urban combat situations becomes a childs hobby) or rough terrrain/jungle warfare.\n \n We have tried to replace high quality soldiers with cool, high tech \"stuff\". It has not worked well. I think the brits (and to some extent the canadians) have it right. They try to find soldiers, then improve them and retain them. The Us military, on the other hand, takes whatever trash they can get and then tries to turn them into soldiers. All too often they are trying to pound a square peg into a round hole. \n \n what we end up with when we put these guys on the line is .....well... vietnam, or Iraq. In vietnam, our soldiers were not adaptive enough to survive. In Iraq, we, thankfully, had men in charge who realsied the limitations of our military. We largely avoided urban combat, and when we could not, we adopted Israeli strategies such as using satchel charges and sledgehammers to bust through every house on a block, so you can approach the enemy under cover the entire time. Of course, by the time you get to the enemy, they are gone, and you have made 200 more enemies because people are mad that you demolished thier house, but at least your guys are alive. \n \n the one time we did go into an urban combat situation for \"real\" was fallujah. We falttened the city with arial and artillery bombardment before we went in, tyhen ran tanks and APCs through the entire place. Certainly made more enemies than friends there, so we then withdrew to heavily fortified positions as people returned to the city. \n \n I guess what I am saying is that while we certainly spend the most money on our military, and we certainly have more equipment than anybody else out there, \"better equipped\" would have to depend on the job at hand. I know that if I was going into a modern war, where urban combat was likely, I would mucjh prevfer to have the british army, or the australian army to \"play with\" than the US army.",

Better equiped? For fighting where? On European turf? Because I guarantee you they're more ready to fight on their turf than the US is. Experienced? In terms of having killed people sure, but its a whole new ball game if Europe and the US goes to war.\n \n You are so far off...wow, must be an American.\n\n leaving aside the elites of various countries, and the elites tend to be fairly compatible, the most comparable military in the world to the US is Israel. when it came to urban combat, review how the israelis did in their operations to that of the americans in iraq. most of the american casualties are from IED and actual combat encounters are overwelmingly american victories. a combination of training and equipement. in particular look at how the americans took Faluja for an example of a large scale urban population. the israeli has not comparable combat success.\n then survey the near-superpowers. the soviets/russians showed poorly in afghanistan and chechnya. the chinese last major combat operation was against vietnam in the eighties and significant casualties were suffered for their attempted border incursion. \n speaking of vietnam, their top general have publish post victory that they lost the battles in the field, even battle like Tet, but won the war because of internal american politics, and a little help from Hanoi Jane and Kambodia Kerry.\n Then lets look at Europe, with only 3 countries capable of extended military operations, UK, France, and Germany. of these the Brits are probably on par experienced and capability wise, but talk to them and they will tell you that the yanks have better equipements. not much can really be said about either France or Germany.\n And that leaves the Aussies, which are comparable to the Brits.\n \n your comment regarding where the war to be fought certainly will play a role. and who would win between europe and the US. certainly anyone fighting on their home turf would fight with greater purpose and vigor. and amusing enough the old-current US military was designed to fight such a continental war. but should a war break out between the US and say the EU, the US would be much more capable of taking the war to Europe than the EU are of taking the war to the US. also considering the gun culture in the US i would say the europeans have zero chance of taking the US while the US has a chance of taking Europe.",

Once again the US brought in their billion dollars' worth of goodies, goodies that the EU would have the ability to put a hurting on before the US could bring it to bear.\n \n You were the one that said if the United States were to invade Europe, the US would have no trouble, so I was talking about an invasion of Europe by the United States. There is no point in trying to bring in this new point of who would be able to successfully invade who, the Europeans wouldn't invade the United States even if they were invaded. The fact that Europe could not successfully invade the United States and won't either, does not legitimize your claim that US would stomp the Europeans.\n \n Furthermore against an opponent like Europe you completely failed to mentioned the fact that 1. their navy prevents the US from invading the way they did Iraq, 2. The US has troops/resources based in Europe, so they would have be aware of an invasion long before one came, 3. There are more than 3 nations who would be capable of mounting a defensive war.\n \n 1. England has significantly reduced the size of her navy, but the mere existence of a hostile naval force would mean the following for US forces.\n a. Inability to bring Naval artillery, sea-based air assets, sea-based troops into play until said hostile navy was neutralized.\n b. Inability to equip/reequip forces using sea-based resources.\n This means that the US will have to invade a military power that exceeded Iraq's in both manpower and up-to-date equipment with a slightly reduced force/abilities.\n \n 2. The simple fact that the US has troops stationed in Europe means there is no way we can launch an invasion without giving the Europeans prior warning. Unless the US government decides to completely negate informing those assets of an impending invasion, at which point their lives are likely forefit as retaliation to an unprovoked attack. So the limited factor of surprise which was utilized against Iraq would not be present in any invasion of Europe.\n \n 3. I think this point doesn't really need any explaination. A defensive war is far easier logistically than an offensive operation, and Europe has many countries whose military's sole purpose is to defend against invasion, and not in the sense that the United States military hasn't protected it against invasion in over 100 years.",

Maybe you're too young to recall but, there was a very tangible fear tat the USSR would do the same when it collapsed.\n I could give a toss if France and the UK have a couple hundred nukes. The scenario is, the US collapses. In my mind, that means we're on par with the rest of the losers of the world and don't have much more to lose.\n So we lose a few score cites to your puny weapons...assuming they are capable of surviving a 1st launch by some idjit like me (It is my finger on the launch button after all). The reason why the US has soo much junk is so that some would survive a 1st strike in cold war thinking. If we do the 1st striking, you got jack and **** left to retaliate with. \n Getting down to conventional weapons. It's often said there's a certain quality to quantity. The US has a far greater force projection capability that nearly any other nation. And, while you too have goodies like smart bombs, who has the mostest? Who has fewer planes sitting inactive due to lack of parts because tax monies go to liberal feed-the-people social welfare programs?\n \n So, yeah, you took things out of context.\n Primarily thinking some net jerk like myself, who think's 'If I can't be number one, NO ONE will!' speaks for all americans. Seriously, my 1st response to losing a game is to kick the board over and start a european style riot. Then I deny the event ever happened. But, that's assuming I ever lose a game...which just don't happen.\n \n \n \nWhat are you high on? Better equiped? For fighting where? On European turf? Because I guarantee you they're more ready to fight on their turf than the US is. Experienced? In terms of having killed people sure, but its a whole new ball game if Europe and the US goes to war.\n \n You are so far off...wow, must be an American.\n\n \n Yep, on European turf. But, maybe not for much longer. We DO actually have US soldiers stationed on Europe...can you say the same for Euros in America? What the hell do you think we do there? Besides pretend to fight ruskies...drink your beer and screw your women? We have soldiers who simply know your land. The US spends more and has more to show for it on military items than any other nation does. Heck, we get blasted on forum board by lefties all the time for it. Usually, the laments include remarks on how we can solve all our problems by throwing the military budget funds on social ills and bad guys. Yes, experienced. Fighting is fighting. \n \n Besides, the ******* contest is pointless. Euros would roll over before fighting ever started. What's the worst that would happen for Euros to lose to the US? You eat our culture and engage in trade with us on our terms? Pretty much already happens. As far as many are concearned, you're already conquered and occupied. When the US collapses, all it means for you guys is that you'll have to learn another language. My hope would be that it's that African bush language that's composed of clicks, pops and whistles...but, the speakers tend to be pacifistic...but, then we might have to learn it too. *sigh* Ok, it can be the Aussies. While not as multi-lingual as fracas, I only studied french, german and russian, if the Aussies dominate, I can speaka da language already (I'm a really lazy peorson). And, while the thought of watching a spaniard or frenchman whistle-pop-whistle might be funny...it's not worth the bother if I have to do it too.\n \n \n \n Just remember, God couldn't be everywhere...that's why we have America.\n emoticon_rolleyes \n \n Care to pull my finger?\n \n This post brought to you by Mercury poisining.

Corruption in the sense that there is no real quality control of the leadership in the military, historically there was at least a little bit of a check and balance system. Vietnam, some of the officers killed were killed in \"friendly fire\" incidents, and if those officers happened to be worthless leaders and complete f-heads that make everyone's lives miserable, no big loss. The point is, in the military before there has always been a little weening of the leadership, a little bit of cleaning up, now there is almost zero. The XXXXXXXXs in charged figured they increase their chances for survival politically if they all stand together regardless of how messed up one member of the group is, but so long as they keep group cohession they will all survive. Good survival tactics, but bad in almost every other way. In quite a few of the branches people realize this and it takes some fairly morally bankrupt person to say, I want to become part of the system that oppressed me, because that life will be an easy one. For the most part the military leadership only cares about itself, and its survival, thats like your brain saying I want to hoard all the blood and even some other than vital organ fails I don't care or I don't care if that means the rest of the body has to work harder so long as I have enough blood to make me comfortable. Except in this scenario the brain isn't very smart, it serves very little purpose, and it is more of a problem than anything else. Yes I understand there is likely to be similiar corruption in European military leadership, but not to the extent as that of the United States because the US military is overinflated, its too big and it can't fight corruption if it wants to fight it at all.",

In Afghanistan, the governmetn we put into place controls only 10% of the country. the taliban is still around fighting, and even the 10% that is governmetn controled is not safe after dark.\n \n In Iraq, we blew up a military composed of 20 yr old russian junk, wholly lacking an air force, and once we destroyed the civil authority and realised that we were badly outclassed in urban combat, we withdrew to heavily fortified positions and hid like scared women. Our troops do not even handle outside security around the green zone in baghdad. We have Iraqis manning the posts. \n \n Already, the military is devoting time blocks of 3 weeks in tactical training classes to what we did wrong in Iraq. While it may be convenient for politicians and civilians to sit around and make ludicrous statements regarding our sucess or failure in Afghanistan, Iraq, vietnam, korea, etc... It behooves the military to figure out what we did wrong so we can try to fix it.\n \n The military community is largely viewing the Iraq mess essentially as a loss for the US military. We certainly managed to blow up a bunch of old russian garbage, but we failed to take the country, which was our objective. \n \n \n \ni find it funny how Vietnam has become the mantra of the anti-military voice, yet that was nigh 30 years ago with some astounding successes since\n\n \n Maybe you could list some of those astounding sucesses.

   "SSF\n \n the US military performance in Afghanistan and Iraq would suggest otherwise.\n \n i find it funny how Vietnam has become the mantra of the anti-military voice, yet that was nigh 30 years ago with some astounding successes since.\n\n \n Where are you getting your information from? The US military's PERFORMANCE? Okay, are we talking about statistics, or performance? Because statistics are determined by demographics, which as far as I'm concerned can be manipulated to show whatever whoever is presenting the information wants to. To determine performance, you have to take a look at the big picture, a lot of which is statistics, BUT you also have to see things on a small unit level. So I'm pretty sure you don't have a very complete picture of the United State's military's performance in EITHER Afghan or Iraq.",

So was I. We had 700,000 troops in-country and it was estimated taking N. Vietnam and maintaining occupational control of the country would require four times that number. S. Vietnam was never under our control other than around giant US bases and staging areas. To control S. Vietnam meant stopping material and troops from N. Vietnam. Nixon was faced with a general draft while the US was already in public protest, at least one year to ready adequate troops and materials to invade N.Vietnam, and China told us they would consider over two million US combat troops on their border a direct threat and would supply N. Vietnam with unlimited troops and materials to stop us. Please explain the military victory. \n 2. We're in the same position the Russians were, and they had 150,000 troops there. Opium production is higher than ever (if in control that would be greatly reduced) and the way we're begging NATO to help us out I think 15% is probably optimistic.\n 3. What do you want for Iraq? You normally follow administration policy and that's now so far off the mark after multiple refocus sequences of the US public even joe sixpack is beginning to understand we made a bad call. They're going to bleed us out for our stupid mistake. If Iraq's Kurds align with Turkey's Kurd population, now in rebellion, who will you support? NATO Turkey or the 'new' Iraq?",

   "daewoo you really should get updated\n \n firstly, lets differentiate the political goals of a war from the military performance within a war. vast difference.\n\n \n You seem to be the one confusing the 2. Our goal in both cases was to take, hold, and control the countries in question. that was the MILITARY goal. The political goal was transition of the government into one we liked better.\n \n We failed miserably in both cases on the military front. In Iraq, we took and held the country, but have never managed to effectively control it, and there is some question of if we ever managed to take it, since hiding behind heavy fortifications does nto exactly project an image of power. In Afghanistan, there is no question. We simply could not take the country.\n \n \nthen lets look at afghanistan. what you say is true about 1 year ago, but no longer. in afghanistan military operation took a secondary position to the political war. but the military conduct has been very good. friendly casualties are minimum and hostile casualty good. the taliban has been unable to mount any military offensives, and are losing recruits as well as having significant problems with defections. the local warlords are also trading in independent militia for a political role in governence. overall afghanistan has been pacified, not yet subdued, within a reasonable short period of time. the soviets could never even claim as much.\n\n \n We have done nobetter than the soviets on any front there. All we did was ousted the taliban and put a weak government in place. The warlord are still controlling the lions share of the country. They have certianly backed off their milityias, but only because the new government has realised that they are effectively never going to rule anything but Kabul, and even that only during the day, and they have stopped military actions against the warlords. They know as well as anybody that the minute US troops are either out of there or their strenght is diminished enough to no longer be a threat, they are as good as dead. Their strategy has gone from one of strength to one of endless groveling. They apparently hope that if they appease those more powerful than them, they will be alllowed to keep kabul when the dust settles.\n \n Pacified? No, appeased is the word you are looking for. Now that it has been accepted that we cannot beat the warlords and the talibam, they have been legitimised. Afghanistan has effectively been carved up into little fifedoms.\n \n \nthen lets look at iraq. no one is claiming the rout of saddam as any sort of military victory. what is happening is how the us military has conducted the anti-guerilla war to allow a political victory to occur. as i said in other posts this include the active engagement against insurgents, as well as twarting IED attacks. two years of guerrila war and only 1500 casualties. along with major engagements against Sadr in Najaf and Sunni in Falluja.\n\n \n 2 years of guerilla warfare, 1500 dead americans, 100,000 dead Iraqis, and we still can not claim control of a single city in Iraq. The only parts of the country we can actually claim that we control are the heavily fortified US bases. Our new government there is decidedly anti US and is about as far from what we were after as you can get. We removed a seculr, pro western government and installed a fundamentalist one. Way to go. That is the political \"victory\". Ther ehas been no military victory. The texts I have seen thus far that they are using to teach the failures of the Iraqi war to us servicemen place the blame of a failed war on the fact that we traded US casualties for Iraqi civilian casualties, and the Iraqis are more than aware of it. We treated Iraqi civilian deaths as inconvenient, but irrelevant, in order to ensure that the war remained popular at home.\n \n This was one fo the major mistakes of Vietnam. For every civilian you kill, you make enemies of their families. While that is certainly a failure on the political side, they (the military) allowed it to affect their planning and strategy.\n \n In both fallujah and Najaf, as soon as the street fighting started, we withdrew. We won no battles in either city, until our massive assault in fallujah, where we effectivley leveled the entire city using air strikes and artillery, then drove tanks through town. We made enemies of everybody who lived there and tried to return following our \"liberation\". \n \n \n \nnot to say everything has gone right, and mistakes often teaches more than success. both lessons needed to be learn.\n as opposed to GW1, which was nothing other than an application of overwelming firepower. little could be learn from that.\n and as opposed to Vietnam, where a military victory was handed to a political defeat. that lesson was an important one.\n\n \n There was NO MILITARY VICTORY in vietnam. That was a humiliating military defeat all around. If we truly won every battle as you suggested, why were there literally people hanging off the skids of helicopters trying to escape our embassy as it was overrun by enemy forces?\n \n \nand ultimately the application of military force in war is to achieve a political victory. afghanistan is a political victory for the US, as Iraq is turning that way as well. both have held local election, both governments have broad support from its populace, and in both the population has largely turned against the opposing forces.\n\n \n Current governmetn support in Iraq and Afghanistan is based soley on the fact that they know as well as we do that the only thing keeping them in power is US force. We will likely see a real \"governemtn\" in Iraq before we see one in afghanistan. In afghanistan, we rigged the elections. That government will never have legitimacy with its population, so it will always be dependant on foce to keep its people in line, and will probably never control more than the 10-15% of the country it does now. In Iraq, on the other hand, we tried our best to rig elections and failed. The guys who are currently running things are the opposition. They are the same folks who were runnign sadr city and this shia portions of the country, where US troops were simply not allowed to go. If we were after a governemnt in Iraq who we could be certain would not support terrorists, we are backsliding.",

   "Daewoo\n \n that is where you are wrong. the goal of afghanistan and iraq had nothing to do with acquisistion of dominion, control of territory or people. both were to eliminate a hostile regime in the taleban and saddam. both these goals have been accomplished. the secondary goal was to instill democracy, and since both have embarked on this path, this too is a success. and only finally install a friendly regime; we will see about this. the reason friendly regime is 3 and not 2 is obvious as we did not install a friendly dictator as we have in the past. besides, i'd wouldn't consider liberated france or germany particularly friendly ones either.\n \n it would have been folly, ala the soviet model, to seek control and dominion over the land and the people. besides, what would we do with them? what would we want with them. \n the goal was change of the status quo and this was a political end. let the natives sort things out for themselves, rule themselves as they wish within the context of democracy. we have never established a federal bicameral, tri-powered system as we have whether it be in latin america, france/germany or japan/korea.\n \n on the military front, i've really have nothing to add beyond what has already been posted by me, our military engagement have largely been military succeses.\n falluja and najaf: you should read what the natives are doing and saying since both have been liberated. don't trust the MSM.\n \n vietnam. read how Giap thought about surrendering, holding out a sliver of hope that the US would withraw because of how unpopular the vietnam war politic was at home (even though at the height of GI casualty in vietnam, 68-9? US polls still showed 60% support for the war) as manipulated by the media and the antiwar crowd, coordinated and funded by communists. yes it was a humiliating defeat for the US, but it was a political defeat, not a military one.\n \n you seem particularly dependent or at least representative of the native american perspective of afghanistan, iraq and vietname. you should read what the natives believe.\n \n btw, i've read the Lancet article estimating the 100,000 dead. it was tabloid reporting, statistically flawed in both the 95% confidence interval spanning 16000-184000 estimates, and the methodology of using a survey to estimate deaths rather than any documentation of such, leading to the likelihood of over estimation as well.",
