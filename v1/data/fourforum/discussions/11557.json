   "Well actually the assertion of atheism is that God does not exist.\n\n Beg to differ. That depends on what the individual understands by the term atheism. It's also why many are seeking a different term because it reflects an apparent blanket worldview which is far from correct in a number of cases.\n \n Virtually all atheists on another forum I frequent say that there is no evidence to substantiate the existence of God. In so many arguments he rules himself out of existence. But that is not to say that he does not exist: we just don't give the idea credence. In that respect, the atheist debater does not say that God does not exist, we ask that theists back up their assertions that he does. Remember what the original definition of atheism is.\n \n \nThis is a position that can be supported by proof.

Free will means that in a situation where choice is an option, you get to choose. If you know what choice you will make, does it suddenly become not a choice? I don't think so. Technically I have the choice to, for example, kill my wife when she gets home. However, I know I'm not going to do that. Does that mean I don't have free will? By no means. I simply know, based on the data I currently have, that I will not make that particular choice when the time comes.

It does not define an infinite number of things. It defines few if any things. It only applies to things that are omnipotent, not things that could be but you can't tell for sure. And it isn't necessarily the function of a definition to help you uniquely identify anything. For example, a \"doppleganger\" is defined as a double of a person.

There is an absurdity in the definition but I haven't been able to put my finger on it. \n \n We can easily argue that slunkles exist on the basis that its existence can't be disproven. You can't prove that my goldfish Sid doesn't have the ability to swallow the sun in a single gulp. Similarly I can't disprove that you can run a mile in 30 seconds. The creature doesn't need to demonstrate its ability. Choosing to not demostrate its ability to do something does not change that creature's ability to do it. The truth about something doesn't change if it has no proof or evidence to support it, it just makes it irrational to believe. \n \n Occams razor is not a tool of logic per se. It describes beliefs that we can classify as irrational. If there is no basis to make an assumption, there the assumption is not needed. If there is no basis to believe that my goldfish can swallow the sun, and no evidence that my goldfish has swallowed the sun or any star or planet for that matter in the past, then there is no reason to assume that my goldfish has such an ability. But it doesn't change the truth about whether my goldfish has such an ability. \n \n Unlike russel's teapot, God is defined not by physical properties, but by assumed abilities. And abilities can be demonstrated at the whim and discretion of the one that possesses them. They can also be witheld or hidden or even latent, yet still exist. Evidence for something with physical properties can be objectively observed, but evidence for an ability to do something is entirely contingent on the individual claimed to have that ability. If he demonstrates his ability, then we have evidence, and there is no other way to get that evidence. \n \n From this definition we can conclude that it is irrational to believe that God exists, just as it irrational to believe that slunkles exist.

   "You missed my point. Obviously definitions are critical tools in logic; you must have a clear understanding of what is being argued to argue meaningfully. But simply defining something in no way means you are making a logical argument, you aren't even making an assumption. To define a term in no ways means that you are asserting that the thing defined actually exists. A definition is not a premise or an assumption or any of units which fit together to build a logical argument. Premises and assumptions have truth values, definitions don't. A definition is simply the agreed upon meaning of a term. \n \n\n The thing is, we make definitions true by agreeing on them. \"A square has 4 straight sides of equal length\" is true because we all agree that this is its definition. And by extention, it is illogical to create a round square or a 3-sided square because of what is established as the definition of a square. In effect, all definitions are true.\n \n \nCase in point. Define God as a thing which exists. Therefore, God exists. I trust you see the flaw in that \"logical\" argument? Simply defining something carries no actual logical weight, you can't simply create a definition and then use it as a premise.\n\n If God is defined as a thing that exists, and it is universally agreed upon, then the statement would be true, but the other characteristics like omnipotence would cause a logical contradiction. If omnipotence doesn't exist, then an entity that possesses omnipotence cannot exist either.",

Rather than God, what if we defined a subatomic particle, the Zuon, and assigned it in the defintion with certain properties. And, both of us being famous particle physicists, they were totally plausible properties which explain some phenomena. Does the fact that we came up with a plausible defintion make it \"true\"? Does this particle suddenly exist just because we defined it? No, obviously not. Only when we actually find this particle and can compare it to our defintion can we say if the defintion was \"true\" or not. A defintion isn't \"true\" because we agree it's true, it's \"true\" if and only if it accurately describes that which it is defining. It would be \"false\", \"illogical\", or \"absurd\" if it described the thing being defined incorrectly, and if you can't tell if the defintion is accurate or not than the defintion's \"truth value\" is indeterminate.

A leg is defined as a certain thing, a tail is defined as something else.

We can define that a zuon is indeed a subatomic particle that is responsible for certain atomic attributes and functions, without determining whether zuons exist or not.
