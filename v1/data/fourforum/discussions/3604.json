A friend of mine who wanted the Tifa date was annoyed by all the opportunities to raise Aeris' affection quota. And I guess I got creeped out when Aeris wouldn't let Cloud leave her home. But she has so many redeeming qualities.\n \n \nDid you know that if you only talk to areis through out the whole game that you can take her out on a date towards the end before she dies.

You can date Yuffie, too, but nothing meaningful really happens compared to the dialogue in Aeris' and Tifa's dates.\n \n I've read about Cloud and Yuffie. It's interesting. Maybe if she was a bit older...",
