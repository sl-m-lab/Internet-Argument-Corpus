   "ABC News' Teddy Davis Reports: If Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., succeeds in repealing the entire Defense of Marriage Act, the recognition of same-sex marriage is more likely to spread from state to state, according to a leading conservative constitutional law expert. \n \n \"Certainly, I think it would be fair to say that it would be more likely for a court decision to impose the recognition of same-sex marriage from Massachusetts on another state in the event of the repeal of D.O.M.A.,\" Pepperdine Law Prof. Douglas Kmiec told ABC News. \n \n Kmiec, a former constitutional legal counsel for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, offered his assessment after the Obama campaign confirmed for ABC News that the Democratic presidential hopeful supports the full repeal of the D.O.M.A. legislation which was signed into law by former President Bill Clinton in 1996. \n \n \"He supports the complete repeal of D.O.M.A. which is the same position he has held since early 2004,\" Obama spokesman Ben LaBolt told ABC News. \n \n D.O.M.A. has two key parts. One component stipulates that no state need recognize a marriage between persons of the same sex, even if the marriage was recognized in another state. A second key D.O.M.A. component prohibits the federal government from recognizing same-sex or polygamous marriages for any purpose, even if recognized by one of the states. \n \n Obama's top rival for the Democratic presidential nomination -- New York Sen. Hillary Clinton -- wants to equalize benefits for gay couples in state-recognized marriages by repealing the portion of D.O.M.A. which pertains to federal benefits. \n \n \"I want to repeal Sec. 3 of D.O.M.A., which stands in the way of the extension of benefits to people in committed same-sex marriages, and, you know, I will be very strongly in favor of doing that as president,\" Clinton said Thursday during a presidential candidates' forum sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign in Los Angeles. \n \n While Clinton supports equalizing the provision of federal benefits, she opposes full D.O.M.A. repeal. \n \n \"She believes marriage should be left up to the states,\" said Clinton spokesman Phil Singer. \n \n Obama, by contrast, views D.O.M.A. as \"an abhorrent law\" and he has accused those in Congress who passed D.O.M.A. as only having been interested in \"perpetuating division and affirming a wedge issue,\" according to a 2004 statement that he gave to the Windy City Times, a gay newspaper in Chicago. Believing that D.O.M.A. is not needed to protect states from having to recognize marriages that are contrary to their own public policy, Obama has broken with his top-tier rivals in taking the controversial step of calling for a complete D.O.M.A. repeal. \n \n While the Illinois Democrat has been calling for D.O.M.A. repeal since 2004, this was not always his position. \n \n When he began his campaign for U.S. Senate, he told a group called Independent Voters of Illinois -- Independent Precinct Organization that he supported D.O.M.A. He then switched to an anti-D.O.M.A. position on Feb. 11, 2004, as the March 2004 Illinois Democratic primary drew near. According to Obama's staff, the Illinois Democrat changed positions mid-campaign because he heard from gay friends how hurtful D.O.M.A. was. \n \n Obama, who taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago, rejects Kmiec's argument about the potential consequences of full D.O.M.A. repeal. \n \n \"The Full Faith and Credit Clause [of the Constitution] does not prevent a state from refusing to recognize a marriage that is contrary to its own marriage laws,\" said Obama in October 2004, according to a Chicago Tribune clip provided by his campaign. \n \n \"If that's really Sen. Obama's position,\" Kmiec told ABC News, \"it seems to be inherently at war with itself because the purpose of the Defense of Marriage Act was to reaffirm the states' ability to assert its individual public policy against the external imposition of another state's determination.\"",

But that of course is the fear that many have, i.e., that gay marriage would be imposed via judicial fiat (whether at the state or federal level) rather than through legislative means.\n \n \nObama, by contrast, views D.O.M.A. as \"an abhorrent law\" and he has accused those in Congress who passed D.O.M.A. as only having been interested in \"perpetuating division and affirming a wedge issue,\" according to a 2004 statement that he gave to the Windy City Times, a gay newspaper in Chicago.\n\n \n Obama's statement here is simply absurd. It doesn't bear out with the reality.\n \n DOMA cleared the Senate by an 85-14 vote, and it cleared the house by a 342-67 vote. It was an extremely bipartisan vote and is massively supported by the American people. It rather appears that Obama is actually the one trying to insert divisive wedge issues. This is hot air from the junior Senator asking to be President.\n \n \n\"If that's really Sen. Obama's position,\" Kmiec told ABC News, \"it seems to be inherently at war with itself because the purpose of the Defense of Marriage Act was to reaffirm the states' ability to assert its individual public policy against the external imposition of another state's determination.\"\n\n \n Bingo. This is spot on. Why suggest a repeal of the entirety of DOMA if you support the policy established by part of DOMA? And I repeat my earlier observation: if DOMA is such a travesty, why not go ahead and try to repeal it as a Senator. Such a repeal would have to be initiated by Congress anyway. It's highly unlikely that he could accomplish a repeal of DOMA as President.",

Though I have tremendous opposition against the desire to see courts and judges impose gay marriage while bypassing the legislature. Judicial fiat is a real concept, and it is a legitimate concern. Some may use it as a shield hiding their true motives, but I am far from convinced that it constitutes most people.\n \n Regarding the Oregon scenario, I was an active participant in that thread. Why don't we wait and see what comes of it. Will the opponents of the measures succeed? I haven't a clue. They very well might not.\n \n \nSaid repeal would have to be signed by the President, right? I trust you haven't forgoten who currently holds that position, or how likely his signature would be?\n\n \n You may have missed the context from the other thread I referred to.\n \n The point I made is that the unlikeliness of a Presidential signature did not stop Senator Obama from voting in favor of a required Iraq troop withdraw timetable.

The beauty of the law is that it can be changed without the need for a constitutional amendment. Make the case and you'll win the vote.\n \n To my knowledge, the specific issue has never been addressed.

   "Yes but the couple was married in Maryland and Virginia refused to recognise the marriage. The people who came up with DOMA understood that if one state issued a marriage license to gay people then all other states would have to recognise the marriage.\n\n \n Actually it looks like Virginia did recognise their marriage; that's what they were charged with. It was illegal for them to marry, if their marriage was considered to not have happened then they couldn't have been charged. Loving isn't about recognising the marriage, it's about making it not illegal. That may be a subtle difference, but we are talking about law here. Subtle differences can be very important.",

   "If they found a need to amend their constitutions then it's quite likely that it was because their constitutions guaranteed equality or somesuch which could well be interpreted to apply to gays.\n\n \n This is really the problem. And I'll try to illustrate what I mean as best I can. If I am unclear please let me know, and I will try again.\n \n The main dispute that people are currently having is whether a constitution (whether the federal or state) requires the recognition of gay marriage. Now, if the people of a state did not intend gay marriage to be protected by their constitution when it was ratified, then it should not be interpreted to hold that it does. If judges were ascertaining and applying the original meaning of constitutions (just like they do for statutes), then there would not be a big stink about the gay marriage issue. DOMA truly would be unnecessary. I think that because judges have been prone to misinterpreting constitutions in the past (in the view of many people), the people of the states that have passed amendments to make clear that their respective constitutions do not require the recognition of gay marriage. Let me try a summary.\n [*]The people of several states determined that gay marriage is not a right in their constitution.[*]The people of those states observed the Massachusetts scenario whereby gay marriage was interpreted to be required by the constitution.[*]The people of the states then passed amendments making their view clear on gay marriage.[*]In doing so, they were saying, \"Neither our Due Process or Equal Protection clause may not be interpreted to mean...\"I think you would agree that the people are the ultimate interpreters of their constitution. This is an example of the people asserting their interpretation of that document.\n \n \nOf course, the amendments could well have been motivated by simple politically motivated homophobia as well. There's nothing like sacrificing the rights of a portion of your populous to gain a few votes now, is there?\n\n \n I'm sure there were some of these in the mix. I don't dispute that.\n \n \nI didn't mean to suggest that all state constitutions would require the recognition of gay marriage. Just the ones with strong anti-discrimination and equality clauses.\n\n \n To my knowledge, all the states have adopted Due Process and Equal Protection clauses in their constitutions. If you are not so sure, I will try and look it up.\n \n \nAre you suggesting that that might be an actual reason, in and of itself? Preservation of the status quo? There are thousands of changes every year, the status quo gets changed all the time with nary a peep. It's not change per se that's the problem, it's the nature of the change. You aren't trully suggesting otherwise, are you?\n\n \n Many people believe that from the standpoint of the state, the marriage institution has a purpose. I believe that many people simply do not see how changing the institution would further that purpose, whatever they think it might be. I think that is a sufficient reason to oppose changing the status quo. I would also suggest that if one wants to preserve the status quo, then it is perfectly reasonable under our system and recent history to seek to do so through a constitutional amendment.\n \n \nRead what I wrote again. \"Throw a bone to\". The religious right was, and still is, influential. Have you never heard of someone voting for something they don't like to avoid political fallout? Being pro-gay won't win you alot of votes in alot of the country, sad to say.\n\n \n I think I just disagree with this analysis. The problem is that the support for DOMA reaches far beyond those who would be categorized as conservative or members of the religious right.",

I truly have learned a lot from your posts.\n \n But, in all your posts, I think I'm right when I say, you oppose changes to the DOMA and don't want to mess with \"marriage.\" However, my question to you is where do gay marriages and/or gay civil unions and gay rights fit into your thoughts, outside of the legal hurdles of the constitution?\n \n I'm truly asking a respectful question here. I'm having a difficult time pinpointing what is your personal position.\n \n thx!",
