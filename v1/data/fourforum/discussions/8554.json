Whether they would want the land offered in Uganda or not is beside the point. The point is that they conquered the palestinians for the land, and called it their own. End of story.

So does any Arab stae since they may view Israel as a threat to their security.\n\n \n I have to disagree, only because these 3rd-world arab countries are of the mentality to weild that power like an immature kid with his daddy's shotgun. Just look at how they deal with conflict now: They suicide bomb innocent civilians, set up military bases within densely populated areas, and hide their munitions within schools and mosques so that any enemy fire will create more human casualties than necessary. These people are not civilized. We'd have our president's head on a plate if he decided to put a military target within a school building, wouldnt we? Yet we dignify these people as 'freedom fighters', and are supposed to be more sympathetic for their cause than the innocent Israeli babies who are killed by muslims.\n \n \n\n Iran being unethical. No I do not agree - they are at least having dialogue to prevent a crisis instead of rushing into a rash war and killing civilians left right and centre.\n\n \n Except that the president of Iran has on countless occasions already swore to annihilate Israel.

I dont exactly think this a**hole deserves the nobel peace prize...\n \n \nYes I can say that the US and Irael will create 'chaos and terror' because it was done in the past.

Instead of blaming the criminals we are blaming the victims. After WWII, Israel was on the offensive to take the land. Agreed. At this point, it's up to the Arabs to accept their defeat and live in peace. They CHOOSE to be at war with Israel. What you are implying is that if Israel, the US, and/or any other nation stand up to defend them, it becomes their fault for encouraging chaos rather than the arab nations' fault for creating the chaos in the first place!!",

This terrorist group are a group of people who root in Lebanon society, providing them with facilities and everything. Get rid of these groups, it means you have to totally destroy all of the city , Is that your goal? If Israel go to international court, this nation will be convicted of war crime for sure. And please if US doesn't back Israel for this attack, Iran and Syria would have joined Lebanon to attack Israel and I don't think Israel can handle all three of them at one time so the result will be that all of Israelis who 're back their government for this attack will cry out loud for help from UN but when u attack them, you never thought of UN at all.

The arabs can either accept that fact and live in peace along with the Jews next door, or they can create more war, death and destruction. Israel is now in self-defense mode. \n\n \n Funny how we can choose to forget history if it suddenly does not agree with us. Especially when we were talking about centuries-old war between Israel and the Arabs and how many times in the past Israel won a war against Arab states.\n So what if that might be ancient history - current conflict continues because of recent actions.\n Who can say end of story? Do you know what an insult it is to be forced out of your own lands? Do you know the pain and the many lives that were shattered? How can we know? All we can do is rant and rave about developments from an outsider's point of view.\n \n I must say that it is Israel that must make efforts at peace. It is an Arab region surrounded by Arab neighbors. It wants to be accepted as a legitimate nation in its neighbor's eyes. Therefore it should act as though it should be there and not go on and on doing things that would be obvious provocation of the neighbors. \n \n \n\n I have to disagree, only because these 3rd-world arab countries are of the mentality to weild that power like an immature kid with his daddy's shotgun. Just look at how they deal with conflict now: They suicide bomb innocent civilians, set up military bases within densely populated areas, and hide their munitions within schools and mosques so that any enemy fire will create more human casualties than necessary. These people are not civilized. We'd have our president's head on a plate if he decided to put a military target within a school building, wouldnt we? Yet we dignify these people as 'freedom fighters', and are supposed to be more sympathetic for their cause than the innocent Israeli babies who are killed by muslims. \n\n \n What power do Arab nations have to wield? Suicide bombers do as they do since that is their only weapon of war. Or do you expect them to be given attention by stoning Israeli tankers? I am though in no way condoning the loss of innocent lives whether it's Israeli or Arab. And by they way, is not Israeli Action against Lebanon \"of the mentality to weild that power like an immature kid with his daddy's shotgun.\"? IF the ARAB nations would be wielding their power, I dare say that oil prices would be much higher than it is now.\n \n Kindly define what is \"civilized.\" Perhaps civilized means that you watch your rights be taken away by those who are more powerful that you and you do not speak out or act for your dignity. Instead you will be civilized it you dance to the tunes of those who oppress you.\n \n \n Except that the president of Iran has on countless occasions already swore to annihilate Israel. They back the Hezbollah terrorists along with Syria. I dont exactly think this a**hole deserves the nobel peace prize...\n \n I understand, but saying things like this makes one crucial mistake, in my opinion. Instead of blaming the criminals we are blaming the victims. After WWII, Israel was on the offensive to take the land. Agreed. At this point, it's up to the Arabs to accept their defeat and live in peace. They CHOOSE to be at war with Israel. What you are implying is that if Israel, the US, and/or any other nation stand up to defend them, it becomes their fault for encouraging chaos rather than the arab nations' fault for creating the chaos in the first place!!\n\n \n Who created chaos in the first place? Is that not ANCIENT HISTORY? We intend to punish Iran for what was said. Where is the democracy in that?\n \n I must ask: If the US and Israel were attacked and they lost property, will they accept their defeat and live in peace? I highly doubt",

Take religion out of it -- basic morality and human instinct should dictate that. Anyone who does respect such actions is an animal, and not worthy of calling themselves 'civilized'. \n \n \nAnd by they way, is not Israeli Action against Lebanon \"of the mentality to weild that power like an immature kid with his daddy's shotgun.\"?\n\n \n No. Hezbollah is picking the fight. Lebanon has not been able to control the actions of Hezbollah. Israel is under no obligation to endure their attacks. They are fighting Hezbollah, not Lebanon, but unfortunately some innocent Lebanese get caught in the crossfire. Hezbollah are hiding arms in homes and mosques, and are located within populated areas. Another example of how these arab 'freedom fighters' are not exactly humanitarian-minded...\n \n \nWho created chaos in the first place? Is that not ANCIENT HISTORY? We intend to punish Iran for what was said. Where is the democracy in that?\n\n \n Not at all. I wouldnt punish Iran or any other country for what is said, only what is done. I would be very distrusting because of what they say, but no more. However, Iran and Syria back terrorists like Hezbollah and al quaida, and those are not words, but actions. Actions speak louder than words.\n \n \nI must ask: If the US and Israel were attacked and they lost property, will they accept their defeat and live in peace? I highly doubt\n\n \n Initially, no. Many nations throughout history have lost their land, and if unable to recover at a later stage, have also managed to adapt either to the new borders, or the new ruler. If the US lost land to a neighboring country, and had no means to recapture it, I do think we would eventually adapt over a period of time. Unless of course, the conquering country kept INITIATING warfare -- which is what the Arab states have done -- then no, I think we'd keep fighting back and we'd look like Israel.",

   " Do you think that kidnapping two soldiers is a good enough cause for invading other countries, kill them and burn their place? Please be reasonable. \n\n \n I have every intention of being reasonable. No, not at all. However, let's not forget that this is not the first infraction of hezbollah terrorists, or of any terrorists that Israel has had to deal with. These soldiers were the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. Israel decided that enough was enough, and for THAT, I do support their actions.\n \n \n\n This terrorist group are a group of people who root in Lebanon society, providing them with facilities and everything. Get rid of these groups, it means you have to totally destroy all of the city , Is that your goal? \n\n \n Well, yes. I would NEVER, NEVER intend harm to any innocent civilians, but it's not Israel's fault they are embedded the way they are, and that they hide military targets like ammo in mosques and homes. That same argument was used regarding Saddam and where he hid ammunition, and how he placed his military bases so close to society. One thing these arab states have in common is a lack of concern for their own people when it comes to warfare. They depend on OUR concern for their people, using them as human shields. But, let's face it -- if it comes down to their families or Israel's -- Israel has every right to choose their own!\n \n \n \nIf Israel go to international court, this nation will be convicted of war crime for sure. And please if US doesn't back Israel for this attack, Iran and Syria would have joined Lebanon to attack Israel and I don't think Israel can handle all three of them at one time so the result will be that all of Israelis who 're back their government for this attack will cry out loud for help from UN but when u attack them, you never thought of UN at all.\n \n \n :xcensored the UN. I wouldnt exactly sleep safe at night knowing they had my back if I were a middle-eastern nation. I dont think Israel will expect any more of the UN than they've gotten already. The prostrate UN 'force' that was supposed to 'protect' them from Hezbollah the first time failed miserably. \n \n \n \nAnd to be honest, I don't think US is a good friend to Israel.\n The hesitation they have shown right now is because they want speculate how the situation will turn out to be so please don't be surprise if they decide to leave Israel. Who gonna want to have serious dispute with Iran when they hold Nuclear weapon in their hand. US is not that stupid, ok?\n\n \n I dont like the hesitation either..I wish we'd have been more decisive earlier, too, but I think we're a good friend. However, we're not just going to jump in militarily to fight a battle we dont need to fight, especially with our own forces spread out policing everywhere else. Israel can EASILY handle these thugs, if it stays one-on-one. Israel can handle Syria, too. They've proven that on more than one occasion. Without the nukes, Israel could whip Iran, too, but it would be more difficult if they still had to fight Syria and Lebanon. \n \n If this thing escalates to that level, I assume at a bare minimum we'll be there to keep the playing field level. We'll see to it that Iran will never hold a functional nuke, or get any long range missile off the ground, and we'll likely keep at bay most of whatever air power they have, too.",

   "\n \n :xcensored Israel\n \n This is a phrase that has been going through my mind a lot lately and my inner punk rocker wants to put it on a t-shirt. If only I had the guts.\nIf you only had the guts? What, a master with no guts? Perhaps, Master_Shake_In_His_Boots? If you look around the world you'll see it hardly takes courage to want to publicly screw the Jewish state. Indeed, it's popular among the chattering classes. But if courage is what you truly lack, then follow the yellow road to the green city where the Great Oz says, 'Check with the wizard behind the curtain!' He even has a package deal where one can get a brain and heart to go with the courage.\n \n \nIsrael didn't secure itself anything. It was created by the rest of the world in 1948.\nApparently you give a whole new meaning to the verb 'secure.' Care to define it in your fanciful dictionary? Who in the \"rest of the world\" lifted a finger to help Palestinian Jews turn back the Arab invasion in the War of Independence?\n \n Hint, don't get caught relying on mythic statements like georged's ill-informed assertion that \"all of Israel's military 'victories' over their neighbors have been US engineered...\" To those who accurately know the history, it's no secret the Truman administration had imposed an arms embargo on Israel in 1947, an embargo that persisted throughout the Eisenhower years and was only lifted in 1962.\n \n Perhaps then Palestinian Jews were armed by the British? Hardly! The British White Paper of 1939 was tantamount to a declaration of war on the Palestinian Jewish community. After WW2 when the British Mandate ended, the most effective Arab fighting force to invade Palestine was the Arab Legion, armed and trained by British officers. Sir John Bagot Glubb commanded the Legion as it secured the West Bank, conquered the Old City, and expelled all Jews from Jerusalem's Jewish Quarter.\n \n So when you say 'Israel didn't secure itself anything,' please do be specific as to who exactly who in 'the rest of the world' secured Israel for the Palestinian Jews.",

   "Do you think that kidnapping two soldiers is a good enough cause for invading other countries, kill them and burn their place?\nSure it's enough reason. The Lebanese apparently are slow to learn the price they must pay for attacking Israel, beginning with the first Lebanese invasion of Israel on May 15, 1948. Despite Lebanon being soundly defeated and accepting an armistice agreement, the country officially has remained at war with Israel for nearly 60 years, never accepting Israel's right to exist. The border always remained quiet, even during the Six Day War, as long as Israel was not attacked from Lebanese soil. The quiet on the border ended only when Lebanon condoned PLO attacks on Israel from their territory. When the international community expelled the PLO to Tunisia, the Iranians mobilized their Shiite brethren in Lebanon to continue the battle to exterminate Israel.\n \n If Hezbollah had focused exclusively on their worthy social development programs, the border with Israel may have remained quiet. When the Lebanese civil war ended, Hezbollah was the only militia that refused to disband in accordance with the 1989 Taif Agreement. Even when the UN certified six years ago that Israel had withdrawn from every inch of Lebanese soil, Hezbollah still refused to disband or respect the international border, regularly attacking soldiers and civilians in Israel. The problem for the Lebanese is that Iran and Syria exploit the weak central govn't by creating Hezbollah as a 'state within a state.' The world community, including the UN, was ineffective in reining in Hezbollah and preventing the current disaster. Only time will tell if any country but Israel is truly committed to disarming Hezbollah and extending the central government's authority throughout its sovereign territory.\n \n \nThis terrorist group are a group of people who root in Lebanon society, providing them with facilities and everything. Get rid of these groups, it means you have to totally destroy all of the city,\nYes, the Lebanese people incorporated a terrorist group into their government, bringing much suffering and destruction. The danger is hard to avoid when your neighbor keeps a rocket launcher in his back yard. This current phase of war is not an isolated story of two kidnapped soldiers. Let's hope the Lebanese are soon ready to end the war they started with Israel in 1948.\n \n \n \nWho gonna want to have serious dispute with Iran when they hold Nuclear weapon in their hand.\nGood point!

You imply that they who lost property were the ones who were attacked. Contrary to your imagined scenario, they who lost property--the Arabs--were in fact the attackers, not the attacked.\n \n Your understanding of the conflict may be enhanced by learning to distinguish the attackers from the attacked. In the aftermath of WW2, the UN Charter was promulgated with much hope and optimism for ushering in an era of world peace. Following the UN General Assembly's nonbinding recommendation (Resolution 181) in 1947 to partition the remaining remnant of the British Mandate that lay west of the Jordan River, the Palestinian Arab leadership immediately launched attacks on Palestinian Jews. \n \n In May the following year, the neighboring Arab states joined in the attacks by invading Israel on the very day the British Mandatory Power vacated authority. Thus, no one can reasonably dispute that the Arab states earned the notoriety of having perpetrated the first international breach of the new UN Charter.",
