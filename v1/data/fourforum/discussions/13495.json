Unfortunately my mind has been poisoned by National Geographic and all those annoying facts...\n \n If the world is 6,000 years old, how do you account for fossils? The process of fossilization takes such an enormously long amount of time. If dinosaur remains are really those animals that perished in the flood, their remains should be in a far earlier state of preservation. And for that matter, how come nobody has found remains of modern animals in the state of preservation we find dinosaurs in?\n \n ID proponents claim that fossil layers are the remains of animals that perished in the flood. Then why has nobody ever found sheep remains mixed in with trilobites? How come all fossil layers exist in such a way that organisms from one stage of life are in one and only one layer, organisms from anyother stage of life are in a different and only that layer, etc?\n \n You believe that dinosaurs, like all animals in the Garden of Eden, were vegetarian. How do you explain that the teeth and digestive tract of these animals was completely unable to deal with a vegetarian diet? How do you explain the countless features seen in various organisms which are used specifically and only for predation or defense?\n \n References to 'dinosaurs' in the Bible are extremely ambiguous and, at best, described a version of dinosaurs (upright-walking, swamp-dwelling, cold-blooded dragons) which has been scientifically debunked for nearly a half century.\n \n If a flood really did cover the entire world, where did all that water go?\n \n If a flood really did cover the entire world, how did plants survive? For that matter, how did marine organisms (used to a far higher degree of salinity than they would experience in a flood) survive?\n \n If the world was repopulated from animals that left Noah's Ark, how did they get to places such as North America or Oceania which are seperated by entire oceans?\n \n The Bible gives the exact dimensions of the Ark. Taking the number of known land animals and their sizes and excluding room to move, it is physically impossible to fit two of each into said Ark. The Sauropods alone would require a fleet of arks.\n \n If after the flood each species was represented by only two individuals, how do you explain away the idea of a genetic bottleneck?\n \n ID proponents make such a deal out of the lack of missing link fossils. The fact is that for many groups of organisms (i.e. dinosaurs to birds), we HAVE found those missing links which fills the gaps beautifully. Do you detract that argument?\n \n Some ID proponents believe that very small scale evolution can occur (i.e. one species of warbler into another) but claim there is no evidence larger changes can take place. In fact we see these changes all around us, such as the antibiotic properties of bacteria which on a physiological level is a far bigger deal than some lizard growing feathers and learning how to fly.\n \n The concept of Irreducible Complexity based as far as I can tell, entirely on the bacterial flagellum, has been completely debunked in the case of the flagellum. Do you have any other examples or shall we add this one to the trash pile?\n \n At least some proponents of ID claims that genes cannot arise from mutations.

The fact is that for many groups of organisms (i.e. dinosaurs to birds), we HAVE found those missing links which fills the gaps beautifully.

In fact we see these changes all around us, such as the antibiotic properties of bacteria which on a physiological level is a far bigger deal than some lizard growing feathers and learning how to fly. \n\n \n Some ID proponents personal beliefs have nothing to do with the defined study of ID, which is simply a science that studies signs of intelligence in nature.

   "Great. If it is such a good theory... and you read those books, then you can answer these questions.\n \n What predictions does it make that can be tested? \n\n \n \"Testability\" is not a completely objective term. In William Dembski's words; \"In the real world, testability assumes a pragmatic rather than an in-principle or logical form.\" Also;....\"there is no merit to the charge that intelligent design is un-testable or has not put forward any \"testable models.\" Intelligent Design's claims about specified or irreducible complexity are in close contact with the data of biology and open to refutation as well as confirmation. What's more, as a tool chest for scientific inquiry, intelligent design is more robust and sensitive to the possibilities that nature might actually throw our way than Darwinism, which must view everything from the lens of chance and necessity and take a reductive approach to all signs of teleology in nature.\"\n \n Now I realize that thousands of militant atheists in publicly funded universities have read these words, and have attempted to refute them from many different angles, and it all has been condensed into something that you'll have an easy time finding on the net, and copy/pasting here. But what you may have a harder time finding is something that clearly shows that abiogeneis is any more testable than intelligent design. \n \n \nWhat explainatory power does it have over the TOE? \n\n \n Again, from Dembski; \"Design theorists see advances in the biological and information sciences as putting design back in the saddle and enabling it to out-explain Darwinism, thus making design rather than natural selection currently the best explanation of biological complexity. Darwinists, of course, see the matter differently.\" And, \"which theory can in principle accommodate the greater range of biological possibilities\"? \n \n \n \nWhat testable statement, if proven true. falsifies ID? \n\n \n The same question can be asked of evolution. Dembski; \"...the fact remains that for complex systems like the bacterial flagellum, no biologist has or is anywhere close to reconstructing its history in Darwinian terms (and not just its actual history but any detailed, testable alternatives). Is Darwinian theory therefore refuted? Hardly. Darwinism is wonderfully adept at rationalizing its failures and therefore just keeps chugging along. \n \n Again, I know you can find something from an impressive scientific source that calls Dembski names. But it doesn't change the fact that abiogenesis isn't chugging along nearly as well as Darwinism. Maybe in science textbooks, but not in reality. \n \n \nWhat evidence does it have above and beyond attacking the TOE\n\n \n It does more than \"attack\". Dembski again; \"..let us be clear that intelligent design, conceived now not as a theory but as a tool chest, can accommodate all the results of Darwinism. To be sure, as scientific theories, Darwinism and intelligent design contradict each other since intelligent design claims biology exhibits actual design, whereas Darwinism claims biology exhibits only apparent design. But as a tool chest, intelligent design incorporates all the tools of Darwinism. Intelligent design assigns a high place to natural causes and mechanisms. Insofar as these operate in nature, intelligent design wants to understand them and give them their due. But intelligent design also regards natural causes as incomplete and leaves the door open to intelligent causes. Intelligent design therefore does not repudiate the Darwinian mechanism. It merely assigns it a lower status.\" \n \n And with its failures of abiogenesis, it deserves a lower status. \n \n \n \nand the logical fallacy of argument from ignorence? \n\n \n Failures of abiogenesis to attain to the level of science, and to be called a \"fact\" by talkorigins, is also a problem with ignorance. Or more accurately, willful lying. \n \n \nWhat books are they, and who wrote them? \n\n \n Take a guess. \n \n \nWhy do I think they are popular books, and not peer reviewed scientific articles?\n\n \n Because you know the peer review process is biased. Anything submitted for peer review with a recognizable name like Dembski or Behe will be automatically rejected before the first word is read. The scientific community's problems are just that big.",

Marc, your first reply is a barrage of question dodging maneuvers, while authoratatively spelling out what ID isn't. So you don't address any of the questions, and you don't contriute to the discussion either.\n \n Fair enough. \n \n What really disappointed me was your statement here about Darwin's observation and theory. Evolution has nothing to do with accidents of any kind whatsoever. This is nothing more than evidence that you still don't understand what evolution is. The changes caused by evolution is a direct response to the changes in the environment surrounding the organism. There is no accident there. \n \n Genetic reproduction allows for variance in offspring. There is no accident here either. No two living organisms of any kind (expect twins, etc) are exactly alike. Why is that so? Why is it that no two organisms have ever had the same genetic composition? Is that a feature of ID? Explain how ID accounts for the fact that genetic variance, even at the cellular level, like say among the billions of sperm cells of a single individual, are randomly varied. Is genetic variance an accidental occurence, or a created function?\n \n Intellegent Design is the study of the idea that certain biological phenomena are too complex to have been evolved from a series of simpler organisms, and therefore must have been created fully functional from the onset. It is based on the idea that if we can observe an organism or an organic function whose existence cannot be explained by the successive adaptation of the evolutionary model, then that organism or function is evidence for intelligent design. \n \n When intelligent design first emerged, among the long list of examples of irreducibly complex phenomena were the eye, the flagellum and blood clotting. All of these have been shown to have simpler counterparts which also fucntion, and therefore which could have been the evolutionary basis for the emergence of these more complex functions. These examples are summarized in wikipedia's article Irreducible complexity - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n The two main problems with ID, and why it is rejected among the scientific community, are:\n 1. It depends solely upon the ignorance of certain scientific disciplines and the current limits of scientific discovery. In other words, every time more information about biology is discovered, ID becomes diminished, rather than bolstered. No scientific studies work like that.

   "If anything, this thread is an excellent education in the typical ID'ers complete lack of knowledge and scientific education. \n\n \n JUST THE OPPOSITE, this thread is a perfect example of how the typical evolutionist has no idea what intelligent design actually is. The opening poster asked completely irrelevant questions about it, and no other evolutionist poster has shown knowledge of the irrelevance of his questions. \n \n \nwhat falsifies the ToE?\n Any out of order fossil, such as Haldane's Pre-Cambrian rabbit. That's one example. Now, what falsifies ID Marc? \n\n \n ID could be falsified if evolutionists could show the step-by-step procedure of how \"biological systems that are wonderfully complex, elegant, and integrated - such as the bacterial flagellum - could have been formed by a gradual Darwinian process (and thus that their specified complexity is an illusion) then intelligent design would be refuted on the general grounds that one does not invoke intelligent causes when undirected natural causes will do the job. In that case Occam's razor would finish off intelligent design quite nicely.\" [Dembski] \n \n \nWhat predictions does ID make?\n The ToE makes many predictions. Here's three from Wikipedia\n\n \n [guess who] \"Intelligent design offers one obvious prediction, namely that nature should be chock-full of specified complexity and therefore should contain numerous pointers to design. That prediction is increasingly confirmed. What's more, once designed systems are in place, operational and interacting (as within an economy or ecosystem) intelligent design predicts certain patterns of technological evolution, notable among these being sudden emergence, convergence to local optima and extinction. Although research in this area is now only beginning, preliminary indications are that biology confirms these patterns of technological evolution. Significantly, these patterns are non-Darwinian.\" \n \n \nOf course, you'll dismiss these and any others that are brought up. Now what predictions does ID make? \n\n \n ID is on the receiving end of dismissal a lot more than it dismisses. ;)\n \n \nID is no less a theory than abiogenesis.\n That's pretty much our point-abiogenesis isn't a theory. It's an hypothesis. A promising one, but that's it. \n\n \n Talkorigins calls abiogenesis a fact! Why is there so much confusion in basic scientific terms? There are plenty of differences of opinion in religion, and it's understandable, considering how much personal faith/Biblical interpretation is involved. Is science that similar to religion? Can't all the testability, observability, repeatability, in science cause some basic harmony with these basic terms?",

   "I'm pretty disappointed. But I'm optimistic. Marc, your first reply is a barrage of question dodging maneuvers, while authoratatively spelling out what ID isn't. So you don't address any of the questions, and you don't contriute to the discussion either.\n \n Fair enough. \n\n \n The disappointment is mutual. You haven't tried to distance yourself from that opening post. The title of the thread was \"ID questions\" and for the most part, those were not ID questions. I contributed to the discussion by clarifying what ID actually is, as also further requested by posts 4 &6. \n \n Suppose I started a thread, asking where the details are in evolution that declare that religious people are stupid, ignorant, insane or wicked? Or if I asked where in the theory of evolution are the details that show how science turned Madalyn Murray O'Hair into the nasty old bag that she was? Those two questions are no more stupid than most of the questions asked of ID in the opening post of this thread. I wouldn't expect my pastor, or most other Christians to chime in and reinforce my asking of those questions, like you have with the questions of this threads opening post. \n \n \nWhat really disappointed me was your statement here about Darwin's observation and theory. Evolution has nothing to do with accidents of any kind whatsoever. This is nothing more than evidence that you still don't understand what evolution is. The changes caused by evolution is a direct response to the changes in the environment surrounding the organism. There is no accident there. \n \n Genetic reproduction allows for variance in offspring. There is no accident here either. No two living organisms of any kind (expect twins, etc) are exactly alike. Why is that so? Why is it that no two organisms have ever had the same genetic composition? Is that a feature of ID? Explain how ID accounts for the fact that genetic variance, even at the cellular level, like say among the billions of sperm cells of a single individual, are randomly varied. Is genetic variance an accidental occurence, or a created function?\n\n \n My statement about Darwin's observation and theory was made only to show a contrast between random natural processes vs purposeful, guided processes. Your nitpickiness about the word \"accident\" doesn't change one bit the point I was making. I know there are lots of little word games in evolution to try to distance it, or soften it, from atheism. That's not important in basic distinctions between what intelligent design is, or is not. \n \n \nIntellegent Design is the study of the idea that certain biological phenomena are too complex to have been evolved from a series of simpler organisms, and therefore must have been created fully functional from the onset. It is based on the idea that if we can observe an organism or an organic function whose existence cannot be explained by the successive adaptation of the evolutionary model, then that organism or function is evidence for intelligent design. \n \n When intelligent design first emerged, among the long list of examples of irreducibly complex phenomena were the eye, the flagellum and blood clotting. All of these have been shown to have simpler counterparts which also fucntion, and therefore which could have been the evolutionary basis for the emergence of these more complex functions. These examples are summarized in wikipedia's article Irreducible complexity - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n \n Yes I know, a lot of people have done a lot of work to try to refute Behe's work. From your link;\n \n \nPotentially viable evolutionary pathways have been proposed for allegedly irreducibly complex systems such as blood clotting, the immune system[59] and the flagellum, \n\n \n \"Potentially viable proposals\" - no proof, no facts. When atheists control 95% of evolutionary biology, I guess that's all that's required to STOP a path of exploration in the public realm. \n \n \nThe two main problems with ID, and why it is rejected among the scientific community, are:\n \n 1. It depends solely upon the ignorance of certain scientific disciplines and the current limits of scientific discovery. In other words, every time more information about biology is discovered, ID becomes diminished, rather than bolstered. \n\n \n JUST LIKE ABIOGENESIS! Every time more information about biology is discovered, abiogenesis becomes diminished, rather than bolstered. \n \n \nNo scientific studies work like that. \n\n \n Except abiogenesis? \n \n \nThe advancement of one scientific discipline cannot weaken another scientific study unless one was false to begin with. \n\n \n So abiogeneis is false? Why does talkorigins say it's true? Why does it remain in science textbooks? \n \n \n2. It is not testable. Intellient design is pivoted on the idea that a creator exist. However, such a creator cannot be reached for comment, and no new biological phenomena are being created today. Regardless of how devoid a particular function may be of evolution history, it doesn't prove the existence of a creator, because it is an argument from the proof of a negative. In ID, no explanation equates to goddidit. \n\n \n If that's true, then in evolution, no explanation equates to abiogenesis did it. If you disagree, then you have a double standard. \n \n \nNow that that's out, marc, why don't you quit dodging questions and actually respond in a way that demonstrates that you have an idea of what you are talking about, please...\n\n \n I don't think what I've said has upset you to near the extent of what Dembski said - the way that I condensed his words to fit the questions that I've been asked.\n \n All I'm saying is that when someone like this thread starter asks taunting, sarcastic questions of ID that actually have little or nothing to do with it, it's very telling that much more educated, higher lever evolutionists will fold their arms and say. \"Yeah!! How does ID explain Noah's ark?\", rather than show any knowledge whatsoever of what ID really is. No one here has the room to question my knowledge of science/evolution, considering the constant knee-jerk, uninformed responses to intelligent design that are perfectly clear in the highest levels of the scientific community.",

   "We all know what ID is Marc. What we find amusing is your attempt to make it seem complex \n\n \n Life is very complex - it's only logical to recognize that it came about in complex ways. When you say \"we\", are you claiming to represent only yourself and the others on this thread, or all evolutionists? \n \n I don't think there's all that much difference in the knowledge of ID between yourself as an internet troll, vs the real heavies like Richard Dawkins. The knowledge is only basic, because all of you have a short attention span on details of something you only seek to destroy overall. The interesting part is that when someone mis-represents it as was done in this threads opening post, very few throughout the entire evolutionary community will honestly call it for what it is. I suspect someone like Michael Ruse, an atheist who takes in interest in the controversy, would probably be more honest in an assessment of this threads opening post. Most of the evolutionary community is satisfied to see ID misrepresented, if it helps them in their quest to defeat it. It's dishonest. \n \n \nGreat, that's done. ID is falsified. So why are we discussing this? \n\n \n It's been done atheistically, but not scientifically. You should learn the difference.

Only a slight clarification goes like this: \"There is no god, so life had to have arisn by means of abiogenesis.\" That statement has the exact same amount of philosophy in it as does this statement; \"Life is too complicated to have arisn by naturalistic means, therefore it must have been designed.\"\n \n Either they both should be established in public science, or neither should be established in public science. \n \n \nDid you ever notice that no one here is confused about basic scientific terms except you Marc? \n\n \n No, I've noticed that I'm the only one who questions the confusion. You said abiogenesis was a hypothesis, and talkorigins says abiogenesis is a fact. It can't be both. There really are philosophical differences in science.

   "just to make sure I'm clear here, your \"evidence\" for this \"agenda\" to athe-ize children is two chapter titles and a creationist web site? \n\n \n Good thing you're trying to make sure, because you're not clear. I showed more than one link, but the main line in one of those links went like this;\n \n \"Every college level course on evolution will address abiogenesis at length, as will any evolutionary biology textbook.\" \n \n Logic tells me he's right. Why would he make a statement like that if it can be proven wrong? Can you prove it wrong? \n \n \nNo, I'll ask you to understand what you're reading. Is it really necessary to point out such a chapter would exist? \n\n \n If it's typical for what EVERY course would contain, or what ANY textbook would contain, yes, it is necessary. \n \n \nWhat is all listed in \"A. Past and Present Theories\" Marc? What does it state is the accepted theory? To support your point, you would have to find a text book, in use, that states that \"life arose on Planet Earth through abiogenesis, FACT\". \n\n \n To support my point, all I have to do is show that it's IMPLED, or SUGGESTED. That's a LOT more than is done for ID. From the above link; \"Discussions in evolutionary biology textbooks go to great lengths to demonstrate how abiogenesis could have occurred under multiple primordial scenarios.\" Every one - any one. To support your point, you or one of your helpers would need to show me an example of an exception. \n \n \nSeriously, you're going to support allegations of fraud and a world-wide covert conspiracy with a XXXXing chapter title from a textbook you've never laid eyes on that's 25 years old! Jesus Christ Marc, wise up, admit you're insane, and seek help. \n\n \n No, I'm seriously questioning the possibility of an atheistic political agenda, from the scientific community. Their allegations that ID is not scientific also apply to abiogenesis. \n \n \n BTW, in case you missed it, it also discussed extra-terrestrial origins, something you, as an ID'er, should have no problems with, since, like you said, the designer isn't god. \n\n \n I have a problem with any non-scientific speculation in the public realm, since so much effort has been expended to claim that ID is non-scientific speculation, and therefore should be legally blocked from the public realm. \n \n \nYou know what, enough of the nonsense. You object to evolutionary theory for no other reason than it doesn't agree with what you want to believe. You agree with ID simply because it does. Game over, good night.\n\n \n Good night.",

   "What is there to really understand about ID? It can be summed up with one statement:\n \n The universe and biology encompasses features that are simply too complex to have arisen from a natural process and, therefore, a better explanation is that the universe and biology must have been created by a supernatural being.\n \n That's it. Please give me one aspect of creative design that is not contained in that statement and then try and tell us why we don't understand ID.\n\n \n I would first have to ask you the same question I did of T.Q (which went unanswered) When you use the word \"we\", do you claim to represent only yourself and the others on this thread, or all evolutionists?\n \n Concerning that \"one aspect of ID that is not contained\" in your dismissive statement above, one was already given, in post #19;\n \n \n (Dembski)\n \"....intelligent design predicts certain patterns of technological evolution, notable among these being sudden emergence, convergence to local optima and extinction. Although research in this area is now only beginning, preliminary indications are that biology confirms these patterns of technological evolution. Significantly, these patterns are non-Darwinian.\"\n \n That's a bold statement, in the face of the constant mantra of \"ID is not science\".Is there a such thing as patterns of evolution that are non-Darwinian, as he claims? Or is that false - does all evolution fit Darwinism perfectly? I'd like to see a scientific answer in layman's terms, not an emotional, atheistic answer. \n \n As far as why you don't understand ID, that's an easy one. It's constantly associated with religion -as it was in the opening post of this thread - with no respect for how it's actually defined. Evolutionists always cry foul when evolution is associated with atheism, citing definitions, and a separation of opinions vs a defined study, and yet show a clear double standard when they do the exact same thing to intelligent design. It's not honest. Intelligent design IS associated with religion, no question about that. But no more than evolution is associated with atheism. If personal atheistic opinions can be disconnected from evolution, as I'm constantly told, then personal religious opinions can be disconnected from intelligent design.",

This is the large scale promotion of ID - all the smaller scale ID promoters are either churches or backed by churches. Taking into account that ID has been scientifically debunked and that only those looking to promote religion in classrooms still support ID, its pretty logical to say it is not science, but religion pretending to be science. \n \n Abiogenesis has been picked apart about as much as God has.

ID is what you and the scientific community try to invalidate. \n \n \nYeah, Marc, you're constant litany of how atheism is entrenched in politics in the US is pretty much shown to be ridiculous by the number of people who'd never vote for an atheist.

There is a divide between the politics of evolution science (practically 100% liberal) vs politics in general. The general public has been informed that science is not a democracy. (it's actually an atheist dictatorship) They may just be a little too busy living their lives to see what it may be doing to them, or to ask what they can do about it. That could change, with enough Obamanomics. \n \n \nHow much research is being done on ID? Why, none! All their money goes to PR, because that's what it is-a PR scam to get creationism into schools. Abiogenesis is a valid scientific field of inquiry because there are hypothesis to be tested. ID is not a valid scientific theory because it is a PR campaign to make you loony crackpots look less loony. \n\n \n Abiogenesis is pseudo science - something used to answer school children's questions about evolution's foundation. Children tend to ask logical questions - they know that a roof can't exist without walls, that a football game can't start without a kickoff. Militant atheists are satisfied with evolution without a foundation, but young, unpolluted minds of children tend to be more curious. \n \n \nYou have yet to demonstrate where abiogenesis is being taught in public schools. So far, you have a creationist website that says it is-and that's as far as their evidence goes, and you have a chapter title from a textbook that was released 25 years ago. In other words, you have your nauseatingly repeated assertion, and nothing else. \n\n \n I have an assertion that you can't refute, except to call it incomplete. If I were to show 10 science textbooks tables of contents, would you be convinced? 100 science textbooks? Would you keep moving the goal posts, while showing nothing to actually refute it? \n \n \nTalkOrigins is not a \"mainstream scientific website\". It's a website designed to counter nonsense like you keep presenting. \n\n \n \"The Talk.Origins Archive is a collection of articles and essays that explore the creationism/evolution controversy from a mainstream scientific perspective\"\n \n Welcome to the Talk.Origins Archive\n \n \"Mainstream\" - it's their word. Here's a whole page of scientific endorsments of talkorigins. How about this one, from that page;\n \n \"In its website on Evolution and Creationism, the most prestigious scientific society in North America, the National Academy of Sciences, recommends the Talk.Origins Archive as a resource for evolutionary theory.\"\n \n or this;\n \n \"The world's largest general scientific society and publisher of the illustrious journal Science, the American Association for the Advancement of Science recommends the Talk.Origins Archive on its page of Evolution Resources as one of a few on-line \"scientific resources [that] provide accessible presentations of contemporary evolutionary theory as well as scientific responses to so-called criticisms of the theory.\"\n \n Long lists of textbooks and courses that refer to talkorigins too. Why do you claim they're not mainstream science? \n \n \nAnd, as has been explained to you by me a couple times already-once there was no life, now there's life. From non-life to life is the basic definition of abiogenesis, even if you don't agree. \n\n \n \"Spontaneous\" is the word you left out. \n \n \nWhy do you insist on repeating the same garbage over and over again as if no one has ever addressed it?\n \n (Apparently Marc edited his post after I replied, so this is a messy read)\n\n \n Now this is a real breakthrough. You and another one here have a habit of applying your own faults to your opponents, and I've often wondered if it's a subconscious thing, or if it's something you intentionally and consciously do. I now have my answer. \n \n You know I didn't edit one word in my post. There is no notation on my post that shows it was edited. You edited your post. It was considerably different than the email notification that I received about the original. You spent 16 minutes making a messy read, and blamed it on me.

   "So, who exactly funds these well funded people? \n\n \n The general public - University grants, and public money for education. \n \n \nThere have been attempts to conceal the funding of ID promotion, mainly by the Discovery Institute. About 70% of the Discovery Institutes source of funding has been identified as religious missionary institutions. This is the large scale promotion of ID - all the smaller scale ID promoters are either churches or backed by churches. \n\n \n Who tried to conceal it, what would be the point in that? It's all private. \n \n \nTaking into account that ID has been scientifically debunked and that only those looking to promote religion in classrooms still support ID, its pretty logical to say it is not science, but religion pretending to be science. \n\n \n It's not logical at all, but it is dishonest. William Dembski says it best;\n \n \nGet on the internet and read some of the criticisms of Michael Behe's work, and you'll think he is a crank, a fraud, and a knave. His work, we are told, has been \"thoroughly discredited\", \"completely demolished\", and \"utterly destroyed\". Critics reluctantly concede that his discussions of biochemistry (Behe's field of expertise) are unobjectionable. But when it comes to his definition and use of irreducible complexity, critics regard him as misguided and safely to be ignored. Critics contend that the biological community has carefully considered Behe's work, found it deeply flawed and therefore rejected it. But in fact the biological community is still coming to terms with Behe's work. Behe has focused attention on a major conceptual problem in evolutionary biology. The problem was noted before, but not in so stark a form. Behe's challenge has been so unsettling that many in the biological community find it easier to pretend his work has been discredited than actually to engage in it. [snip] And so a convenient fiction has emerged in which biologists continually reassure each other that Behe has been refuted but either fail to provide an actual refutation or attack a caricature of Behe's case against Darwinian evolution.  \n\n \n \nAbiogenesis has been picked apart about as much as God has. All that can be said is that abiogenesis probably happened at some point, whether terrestrial or not, and that all life eventually descended from this first lifeform. This is a scientific hypothesis and it fits with all the evidence. \n\n \n It's an atheistic hypothesis. It's not arrived at by the scientific method - the one that is constantly required of intelligent design. \n \n \nMost of the people who are trying to prove ID by disproving abiogenesis (which is not logical) tend to throw very small probabilities at readers. What they fail to mention is that abiogenesis had billions of years to happen. A lot of XXXX happens in billions of years and these improbable events suddenly become not just conceivable, but likely. \n\n \n You didn't use the words \"observable, \" testable\", \"repeatable\" did you? Living things simply do not spontaneously come from non-living things. It's a violation of a law of nature. Louis Pasteur proved it over a century ago, and to this day there's no new evidence for it. An increased desire is not the same as increased evidence. Strange how abiogenesis is allowed to violate natural laws and still be science, while intelligent design is not. \n \n \nThe difference between ID and abiogenesis as far as science is concerned is obvious to anyone, including the courts who decide what curriculum is to be excluded from public education.\n\n \n If it's obvious to anyone, it seems to me you could briefly outline that scientific difference.",

   "It's interesting to note that Michael Behe has gotten a lot of criticism for releasing \"Darwin's Black Box\" without scientific peer review, or any other approval from the scientific community. He's accused of bypassing that, and appealing directly to the public, the ignorant, unscientific public. Darwin did exactly the same thing in 1859.\n\n That's a lie. Darwin presented his theory of natural selection in a paper before the Linnean Society in 1858, along with a paper by Alfred Russel Wallace that presented the same theory. The Linnean Society was the most prestigious body of scientists in England at that time. Both papers were published by the Linnean Society. However, there were no peer reviewed journals at that time. Thus, scientists published their findings in books that were financed by their sponsors. In Darwin's case, he was his own sponsor. It was how scientific research was done at the time.\n \n That's not how it is done today. Neither Behe, Wells, nor Dembski has been published in a peer reviewed journal on the topic of ID. In fact, I don't believe that they have even submitted a research paper for peer review.\n \n However, the books written by the above three and others have been reviewed and answered many times by the scientific community - but not in peer reviewed literature. All works of ID creationism have been found wanting in integrity and scientific meaning in every case.\n \n On the other hand, Darwin's work was read by the scientific community (as was its intent). His ideas were subjected to further investigation and study. Some minor hypotheses were rejected, but most have been supported.\n \n So today progress in science is presented in peer reviewed literature rather than private publications. Scientific journals are full of articles that address matters of how evolution happens. The question of whether evolution happens is moot. Only religious zealots doubt it, not for scientific reasons, but because reality is in conflict with their mythology.\n \n Creationists, whether YE, OE, or ID, don't publish in peer reviewed literature. The reason is quite simple. They don't do any scientific research. They just publish books with scientific sounding language that is meant to dupe the ignorant.

The general public that bought it out on the first day weren't suddenly all interested in blood and guts and microscopes, they were interested in only a basic existence of a godless, natural process that did what the prevailing theory claimed that only the supernatural could do. It's common sense to recognise that high-tech books about boring subjects don't sell like wildfire overnight, without some kind of basic, social implications. \n \n \nThat's not how it is done today. Neither Behe, Wells, nor Dembski has been published in a peer reviewed journal on the topic of ID. In fact, I don't believe that they have even submitted a research paper for peer review.\n \n However, the books written by the above three and others have been reviewed and answered many times by the scientific community - but not in peer reviewed literature. All works of ID creationism have been found wanting in integrity and scientific meaning in every case. \n\n \n So those books by Behe, Wells, and Dembski were like any other books - written for sale to the general public. What was it that PROMPTED the scientific community to review and answer them many times? What is the criteria that causes the scientific community review and criticize a book? Do they feel compelled to check out a book that makes claims about science? That's fair enough, but were they compelled to review and answer other books that make claims about science, such as \"How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist\", or \"The God Delusion\"? Have these two books, or many others like them, ever gotten reviews and answers by the scientific community? \n \n \nOn the other hand, Darwin's work was read by the scientific community (as was its intent). His ideas were subjected to further investigation and study. Some minor hypotheses were rejected, but most have been supported.\n \n So today progress in science is presented in peer reviewed literature rather than private publications. Scientific journals are full of articles that address matters of how evolution happens. The question of whether evolution happens is moot. Only religious zealots doubt it, not for scientific reasons, but because reality is in conflict with their mythology. \n\n \n But, without anything for naturalistic origins, there are still questions of an evolutionary relationship with the supernatural, or some type of outer space involvement. \n \n \nCreationists, whether YE, OE, or ID, don't publish in peer reviewed literature. The reason is quite simple. They don't do any scientific research. They just publish books with scientific sounding language that is meant to dupe the ignorant. Ignorant people don't know the difference between the pretense of science and real science.\n\n \n That's the way evolutionist-atheists seem to do it with abiogenesis also. They put a chapter or two of abiogenesis in high school and college textbooks with scientific sounding language that is meant to dupe school children into believing evolution is a complete, godless package, when it is not. Sometimes it is claimed that evolution is completely seperate from abiogenesis, and sometimes the two are blended as one, depending on the intent of the blender, or seperator. Why doesn't peer review take care of these types of problems? How can ignorant people really learn anything from dishonest people?",

Does it mean;\n Phase 1) Change in allele frequencies over time?\n Phase 2) Humans and chimps share a common ancestor?\n Phase 3) All life on earth shares a common ancestor?\n Phase 4) The entire book of Genesis is wrong? \n Phase 5) Evolution must be used to destroy religion? \n \n The definition of evolution can vary from weak (Phase 1) to strong (phase 5) but abiogenesis seems to completely change by the elimination of the word \"spontaneous\". In the above talkorigins link, they said \"note that creation is a theory of abiogenesis\" All I can note so far is that they pulled that one out of thin air! Where did they get that from? Do they honestly think the originator of the term, Huxley, would have agreed? \n \n They are trying to change the definition of the word, because they held ID to a higher standard than abiogenesis was ever held to. Now they have to try to remove the word \"spontaneous\", and make the term vague, even covering creation, so they can keep it within the realm of science, and continue to promote it in an atheistic way.",

While I'm sure it would be fun, we are refuting points actually made on this forum. In any case, in context the statement made on that website makes sense to me. Lets see the statement within its intentionally omitted, but quite relevant context it was pulled from...\n \n \n\n Abiogenesis is a fact. Regardless of how you imagine it happened (note that creation is a theory of abiogenesis), it is a fact that there once was no life on earth and that now there is. Thus, even if evolution needs abiogenesis, it has it. \n\n \n Please stop bringing this up.\n \n \n\n How is it totally different? Most everywhere you look, abiogenesis is defined with the word \"spontaneous\". \n \n\n \n You really think they are the same? Spontaneous generation was a theory used to explain how microbial life had the ability to appear seemingly from nothingness. Louis Pasteur proved that microbes were invisible and that they were airborne. It wasn't about original origins of life at all. You need to give this a rest. Louis Pasteur did not conduct an experiment with a lab the size of the Earth and a time frame of billions of years. Stop simply pulling nice sounding arguments where there are none.\n \n \n\n That statement is reactionary, it was prompted by a similar statement from evolutionists, who are atheists, and were all the way back to Darwin's time. The claim is that there can't be a God, or if there is, he can't be studied, so therefore life had to arise and evolve entirely from natural processes. It's equally as ignorant and closed minded. \n \n\n \n On the contrary it is very reasonable in a world where religion is shoved down your throat from an early age that someone stops to ask why, since nothing in life supernatural has ever been irrefutably documented, why should I believe all these supernatural, highly improbable stories? To then look for an explanation that is satisfying doesn't sound ignorant and definitely the opposite of closed-minded. \n \n \n \n\n Fits neatly? Why then do I constantly see and hear the claim that evolution can stand completely on its own without abiogenesis? \n \n\n \n Maybe reread what I wrote a little closer...I said the evidence brought forward, namely, that of irreducible complexity, which was easily shown to be very reducible, fits nicely into evolution, not abiogenesis. That wouldn't make sense.\n \n \n \n Just a quick clarification on abiogenesis. You make it sound like it is a theory where magic dust is floating around and then a flash of light and suddenly a little critter is swimming around. The fact is, we don't know the exact mechanics. An obvious speculation is that it started out extremely simple. All you need for abiogenesis is a single molecule that is capable of reproducing itself. We know that all the building blocks of complex organic molecules are common throughout the universe and that they are constantly spontaneously configuring themselves in unique ways and changing due to different energies being applied to the medium. Once just a single molecule finds a way to duplicate itself, suddenly you have thousands of them. Maybe it takes many many tries with molecules going extinct, but eventually one comes about that can duplicate itself in such a way as to improve itself through natural selection. With zero competition, such a fragile molecule has none of the pressure modern life deals with. Its really not that hard to understand how such a process could come about.",

As it says on their welcome page; \"The Talk.Origins Archive is a collection of articles and essays that explore the creationism/evolution controversy from a mainstream scientific perspective\" \n \n \n \nWhile I'm sure it would be fun, we are refuting points actually made on this forum. \n\n \n I've referred to talkorigins in one of my past judged debates simply as \"mainstream scientific\" and was called \"cynical\" for it at these forums, but as we now see, political correctness quite often doesn't change what the truth is. But again, if you want a website that promotes ID to roughly the same extent that talkorigins does evolution, it would be Uncommon Descent - Serving the Intelligent Design Community. The main difference is, they don't tell whoppers anywhere near ones like; \"abiogenesis is a fact\". I wouldn't mind a bit if you'd quote anything from it. \n \n \n \nIn any case, in context the statement made on that website makes sense to me. Lets see the statement within its intentionally omitted, but quite relevant context it was pulled from...\n\n \n \n Talkorigins] Abiogenesis is a fact. Regardless of how you imagine it happened (note that creation is a theory of abiogenesis), it is a fact that there once was no life on earth and that now there is. Thus, even if evolution needs abiogenesis, it has it. \n\n \n \nPlease stop bringing this up. \n\n \n If you don't want to discuss it anymore that's fine, but it looks like the ol head-in-the-sand syndrome to me. I didn't intentionally omit anything. It says \"creation is a theory of abiogenesis\", and it doesn't back it up. Creation is NOT a theory of abiogenesis. Abiogenesis is only about naturalistic, spontaneous, unguided processes. Until they manage to change the definition of the word, that is. They haven't done that yet. \n \n \nYou really think they are the same? Spontaneous generation was a theory used to explain how microbial life had the ability to appear seemingly from nothingness.

Louis Pasteur did not conduct an experiment with a lab the size of the Earth and a time frame of billions of years. Stop simply pulling nice sounding arguments where there are none. \n\n \n The bottom line is, abiogenesis is naturalistic, without the supernatural. It's false to claim it's a fact, as mainstream science is doing. It's also dishonest if no one in the scientific community criticizes talkorigins for claiming it. I see no evidence that they are. \n \n \nOn the contrary it is very reasonable in a world where religion is shoved down your throat from an early age that someone stops to ask why, since nothing in life supernatural has ever been irrefutably documented, why should I believe all these supernatural, highly improbable stories? \n\n \n It's not shoved down anyones throat in the public realm, like common- descent evolution is. \n \n \nTo then look for an explanation that is satisfying doesn't sound ignorant and definitely the opposite of closed-minded. \n\n \n It goes both ways! Some ask why concerning the ever increasing gaps in naturalistic origins of life, notice things throughout life like ordered complexity, and seek a more satisfying explanation. \n \n \nMaybe reread what I wrote a little closer...I said the evidence brought forward, namely, that of irreducible complexity, which was easily shown to be very reducible, fits nicely into evolution, not abiogenesis. That wouldn't make sense. \n\n \n Easily to an atheist, but not so easy otherwise. As Dembski said, [natural selection]\"does not select for future function.\"\n \n \nJust a quick clarification on abiogenesis. You make it sound like it is a theory where magic dust is floating around and then a flash of light and suddenly a little critter is swimming around. \n\n \n I just make it sound like it's defined, unguided, random processes causing life to arise spontaneously from non-life, no God involved. It's not a fact. \n \n \nThe fact is, we don't know the exact mechanics. An obvious speculation is that it started out extremely simple. All you need for abiogenesis is a single molecule that is capable of reproducing itself.

It's not testable, repeatable, or observable by the scientific method, and it's not science if it's held to the same high standards that intelligent design is. \n \n \"...the whole notion of abiogenesis rests upon an exceedingly weak foundation which is actually contrary to much of the scientific knowledge which we actually have obtained through extensive experimentation. Abiogenesis, in fact, violates several basic principles of chemistry and biochemistry which are so universally held as to be axiomatic. To get around these difficulties, evolutionary scientists have turned to various means of modifying their basic abiogenetic theory so as to resolve one or another of the problems presented. Yet, while pointing to directing clays, undersea thermal vents, interstellar amino acid generation, or several of the other more esoteric and generally dismissed theories, evolutionists manage to resolve (or often, just give the illusion of resolving, in the popular image framed by the media) one problem, while yet failing to address the other difficulties. Thus, abiogenesis, as far as can be seen from the actual experimental work and knowledge (apart from any concern for philosophical arguments or pure theory), is not supportable from true science.\" \n \n The Myth of Abiogenesis",

   "If Uncommon Descent is at the forefront of ID research, then there is no ID research. It is basically just a collection of studies and then someone interpreting the results of these studies. They are clearly looking for any possible way to refute evolution, but, of course, not shedding any light on why ID must be true. Most of the posts contain flawed logic and intentional misrepresentations of evolution. \n \n The recent argument says that evolution contradicts itself because there are checking mechanisms that guard against genetic errors in replication. Since evolution requires mutations, this check system could not have evolved since it would have been counter productive to the evolutionary process. \n \n This violates his correct presumption that evolution cannot select for future function, first off. So right there he is actually contradicting himself. He also has to make the bold assertion that more mutations are always better. This of course is not true. Evolution should result in a balance between too many mutations and too few, which in fact, is the way things are.

   "Classic ID resoning - link\n \n \nDarwinian evolution can not possibly explain the life which we find on this planet. Let&#8217;s explore one of these methods by asking the question &#8220;How, and why, did flight originate?&#8221; Before any creature took to the air there was nothing there to eat and so why would any creature, even an intelligent creature, want to fly. There could have been no powerful survival benefit in flight beyond perhaps escaping a predator to recommend it. Also, there are many other and far simpler ways to escape a predator. Flight is perhaps the most complicated and sophisticated activity that any creature possesses which means that it would have taken an extraordinary number of attempts by random evolutionary methods to make it a reality. There is another and even more fundamental question which underlies biological flight. Did nature, completely unguided by intelligence, just somehow know that flight was even possible or achievable? Humans, with their intelligence, were able to make gliders and toy airplanes long ago but they had an objective and they also had the model of the birds to follow. Even at that it took a long time to achieve human flight despite the huge cost in time, effort, and treasure which they were willing to expend. No amount of tinkering, especially without a conscious objective, could possibly account for biological flight. There are simply too many things which would have had to happen all at once for that to be possible. Remember that nature had no way of knowing that flight was possible and it certainly had no previous conception of flight. Without having an objective how can random tinkering achieve anything?\n\n \n UD actually posted this?",

   "If Uncommon Descent is at the forefront of ID research, then there is no ID research. It is basically just a collection of studies and then someone interpreting the results of these studies. \n\n \n Wouldn't studies, combined with their interpretation, be called research? \n Research is defined as; \"diligent and systematic inquiry or investigation into a subject in order to discover or revise facts, theories, applications, etc.: recent research in medicine.\"\n \n \"Abiogenesis is a fact\" - \"ID does no research\"....one of these days I'm going to have to put up an \"index to evolutionist claims\". \n \n \nThey are clearly looking for any possible way to refute evolution, but, of course, not shedding any light on why ID must be true. Most of the posts contain flawed logic and intentional misrepresentations of evolution. \n\n \n That clearly goes both ways. If anyone is looking for any possible way to refute creation/the supernatural, it is talkorigins. If anyone does clear misrepresentations of what ID is, it is the scientific community/talkorigins. And it happens at 4forums, considering this thread's opening post, and subsequent evolutionists posts. \n \n \nThe recent argument says that evolution contradicts itself because there are checking mechanisms that guard against genetic errors in replication. Since evolution requires mutations, this check system could not have evolved since it would have been counter productive to the evolutionary process. \n \n This violates his correct presumption that evolution cannot select for future function, first off. So right there he is actually contradicting himself. He also has to make the bold assertion that more mutations are always better. This of course is not true. Evolution should result in a balance between too many mutations and too few, which in fact, is the way things are. He also completely ignores the fact that evolution does not even need mutations anywhere except for during the process of passing genes on to offspring.

He already explained evolution, he is no saint to evolutionists. We really never needed Darwin to understand evolution. You honestly think we would not, by now, have drawn the same conclusions even if Darwin had never spoken up? \n\n \n Oh no, of course not - Darwin was a smart guy, no question about that, but he was also in the right place at the right time. I've no doubt that the same conclusions would have surfaced within a few decades after Darwin by someone else. But it would have been motivated and received the same as Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" was, by atheism, not by science. \n \n \n It seems ID proponents are still stuck in their own mindset of religion where significant players somehow define their belief system and make it true.

It would be easier to say, \"there is no science here\" than to attack the writers character, but if it shows that they have reason to write a paper that tells lies, why not? \n \n The UD attacks on Darwin indicate that he had underlying motives to destroy God and religion.

Its obvious science whether he came up with it or not.\n \n \nBut it would have been motivated and received the same as Darwin&#8217;s &#8220;Origin of Species&#8221; was, by atheism, not by science.\n \n\n \n Give me a break - just because your religion is threatened by this theory, you call it atheism. Just because many atheists present this theory you think atheism motivates them. In reality, when people of faith first saw the evidence for evolution, they were scared and threatened because they realized what they knew to be true was in fact most likely wrong.

You&#8217;ll find personal attacks by evolutionists on significant players in ID as much or more than you find ID proponents attacking Darwin, or Dawkins, or any number of other significant Evolutionist players.\n\n \n What good does personally attacking Dawkins or Darwin do? None - because they do not define truths, their evidence and reasoning do. However, the church claims that high ranking clergy are capable of defining what is morally correct and what is true. When clergymen misbehave it therefore detracts credibility from the entire religion. They define the religion since they defined and compiled the Bible itself by claiming to channel the word of God, something I would really love to see substantiated.

We have many intermediate stages of the development of flight seen in both living creatures and in fossil records, usually involving some sort of gliding. We see obvious benefits to flying. This is no problem for evolution, in fact, evolution has resulted in flying animals at least 4 separate times. I can think of several animals that can glide and even plants that can glide.

It would be easier to say, \"there is no science here\" than to attack the writers character, but if it shows that they have reason to write a paper that tells lies, why not? \n\n \n It would indeed be easier for them to say \"there is no science here\", and they do say that, but since it's an eye closing ear holding statement of atheism, and not a scientific statement, it only makes sense that they supplement it with other things. \n \n \nThe UD attacks on Darwin indicate that he had underlying motives to destroy God and religion. I'm saying, so what? I don't care if Darwin was a baby serial killer, I still believe his theory because it fits the evidence and makes perfect sense. Its obvious science whether he came up with it or not.\n\n \n And that's the way many people feel about order, and evidence of a progress towards a future function that is obvious in nature. The religious backgrounds of those who point this out don't matter. Why are they attacked by the publicly established scientific community? \n \n \nGive me a break - just because your religion is threatened by this theory, you call it atheism. Just because many atheists present this theory you think atheism motivates them. \n\n \n I'd have to ask you to give me a break - they present it in a way that proves atheism motivates them. You don't see that? I guess maybe you wouldn't if you don't know anything about talkorigins, as you claimed above. Have you ever heard of Steven Weinberg? \n \n \n\"Anything that we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done and may in the end be our greatest contribution to civilization.\" \n\n \n Many indications are that his above statement is taken all too seriously by the scientific community. Such as this list of books that I've shown before; \n \n \nDarwin's Dangerous Idea / Daniel Dennett - 1995\n The End of Faith/ Sam Harris - 2004\n The God Delusion/ Richard Dawkins - 2006\n Letter to a Christian Nation/ Sam Harris - 2006\n The Atheist Universe / David Mills - 2006\n Breaking the Spell/ Daniel Dennett - 2006\n Everything you know about God is wrong/ Russ Kick - 2007\n The Quotable Atheist / Jack Huberman - 2007\n The Atheist Bible / Joan Konner - 2007\n Nothing - Something to Believe / Lalli Nica - 2007\n The Portable Atheist / Christopher Hitchens - 2007\n God is Not Great / Christopher Hitchens - 2007\n God - the failed hypothesis - How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist / Victor Stenger - 2007\n 50 Reasons People Give For Believing in God/ Guy Harrison - 2008\n Godless: How an Evangelical Preacher Became One of America's Leading Atheists / Barker/Dawkins - 2008 \n\n \n I know - it's just their opinions and doesn't change the fact that they're FINE scientists. If only proponents of ID were treated the same way. \n \n \n In reality, when people of faith first saw the evidence for evolution, they were scared and threatened because they realized what they knew to be true was in fact most likely wrong. This conclusion was drawn from science, not atheism. They were, after all, mostly religious people. \n\n \n And the exact same thing is happening in reverse today. When biological scientists today see how complex the simplest forms of life are, how irreducibly complex systems function, they realize what they know to be true concerning abiogenesis is most likely wrong. That conclusion is drawn from science and logic, not religion. They are, after all, mostly atheists. \n \n \nWhat good does personally attacking Dawkins or Darwin do? None - because they do not define truths, their evidence and reasoning do. However, the church claims that high ranking clergy are capable of defining what is morally correct and what is true. When clergymen misbehave it therefore detracts credibility from the entire religion. They define the religion since they defined and compiled the Bible itself by claiming to channel the word of God, something I would really love to see substantiated. Therefore, religion is vulnerable to these such attacks and science is not. \n\n \n There you go again - ID is not \"the church\"- ID is not \"religion\". \n \n \nThere are a few theories as to how flight developed. We have many intermediate stages of the development of flight seen in both living creatures and in fossil records, usually involving some sort of gliding. We see obvious benefits to flying. This is no problem for evolution, in fact, evolution has resulted in flying animals at least 4 separate times. I can think of several animals that can glide and even plants that can glide. So whats the big deal here? This was written as some profound evidence for ID? \n\n \n Plants can glide, in ways that promote their survival? Does everything at an ID site have to be profound? \n \n \nSurely ID proponents, claiming to be based in science, can do better with their most official publication.\n\n \n You should see some of the non-profoundness at talkorigins.",

   "I never advocated the teaching of worldviews, I'm saying one shouldn't have an advantage over the other. The worldview of atheism isn't directly taught, but it is implied.\nThat is; you read that implication into it, because of your worldview. I know a great many people who do not struggle with evolutionary science and God sitting side-by-side, both personally (for example, several Christian biochemists) and famously (for example: the pope).\n \n \nThis flying spaghetti monster thing is so illustrative of the seriousness of the problems in todays scientific community. You're not the only one - it seems that it's seldom possible to get into any kind of science/religion discussion with anyone at any level of the scientific community, without the person representing science to immediately resort to mocking, no matter how childish. I believe it's successful only in how it can help organize a gang of chuckling people to try to overwhelm and stop a debate, but it's not so effective in impressing a genuinely open minded observer. So it may not help the atheistic/science cause quite as much as some of you think.\n \nI mention the FSM, not out of an attempt to mock you, but because of the serious problem it exposes in your argument. I agree with a large part of your quote above; the mockery of 'militant' atheists towards religion smacks to me of arrogance and I wouldn't count myself as a fan of the direction Dawkins or Hitchens are headed in. However, the idea that 'all views should be taught' is clearly an impractical and/or absurd one - which the FSM aptly demonstrates.\n \n \nIt's always the same song - that science is perfect, and it's always promoted/studied in a perfect, non biased way. I've detailed a lot of imperfect double standards in this thread. The scientific community represents science, and the representation sometimes looks like this.\n\n You cannot hold up single examples and expect them to be representative of the whole, especially if you've gone out looking for such examples. Otherwise, Fred Phelps would have done for Christianity a long time ago.\n \n What you are trying to imply is that because science is sometimes misused, the scientific worldview is fundamentally rotten/atheistic. That's not a cohesive line of reasoning, as I hope I've just shown.\n \n \nIt's a fact that they're relevant to one another, because they're presented side by side in science textbooks. \nThat means that the are educationally linked because they share a theme - it still doesn't mean that disproving one will disprove the other. Opening a random textbook at a random page shows me that earthquakes are placed next to the wave properties of light (in the 'waves' section of the book), but that doesn't mean that the two are intrinsically dependent on each other.\n As an aside, could you link me to some of these textbooks? I teach science in the UK to 12-18 year-olds, and I've never seen a textbook mentioning abiogenesis. I'd be interested to see what they say\n \n \nSo, like talkorigins, you claim that abiogenesis is a fact? \n\n I doubt you could successfully infer that from my posts in this thread so far...\n \n I would claim that abiogenesis is the best current explanation for how life began on earth, on the basis that I haven't really seen any evidence to the contrary - and scientists are getting closer and closer to replicating it in the lab. I wouldn't say it was 'fact', though, in the way that I suspect you take the word 'fact' to mean.\n \n \nNo, things in religion (even cherry picked, practically non existent ones) shouldn't be added. Atheist dreams like abiogenesis should be subtracted. They can't be tested in a way that proves they happened, any more than ID can. \nGeorge Berkeley and the observation of reality by God.\n \n I partly agree, although I wouldn't go quite as far as you are going. The idea that we can accurately speculate on the past based on our observations of the present is an inherently true one, although the further back you go the fuzzier such speculation becomes. Hence I would present abiogenesis as an interesting talking point to get students thinking about the different ways in which life could have formed, without presenting any conclusion as to how we think it actually did form (at least partly because we still don't know!).\n \n Evolution, on the other hand (to keep this relevant) is both observable and testable. Adaptation, change in a population and even speciation have been directly observed - and the fossil record seems to accurately tell the history of a great many species, even if there are still the odd gaping hole. \n \n \nDarwin's atheism didn't lead him on a quest to provide an alternative to creation to near the extent that it lead future buyers of his book, and to lead them to extend its philosophy to heights that even Darwin probably couldn't have imagined.\nFundamentally, the tenent of evolution that gets creationists irritated the most has not changed since Darwins day - that man came from apes. 'Darwinism' has been misused just like any other big idea, by atheists, power-hungry dictators and writers of bad fiction alike. Again, the uses of the idea don't change the truth of the idea itself.",

   "I'm just going to stop on the points we've made so far except this one:\n \n \nThere you go again - ID is not \"the church\"- ID is not \"religion\". \n\n \n ID is an attempt to understand and portray evidence in a way that demonstrates \"God did it.\" It is funded and condoned by religious institutions to such a degree that it is obviously an offshoot of religion trying to nose its way into the teachings of public classrooms where religion does not belong. \n \n I guess we just disagree here, but there is no doubt in my mind that ID is religion. The only reason this is denied is because that statement makes ID lose credibility which in turn means that at some level (that of a rational human) you may be ashamed of your religious beliefs.",
