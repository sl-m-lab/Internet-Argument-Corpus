   "Our local sheriff relayed some of the wisdom he and others received after a regional meeting with whatever the DEA is now calling themselves. While he and others tried to explain that meth usage had become epidemic and the resulting crime and civil disturbances are consuming the majority of their field resources, they were told that federal wisdom doesn't see it that way. \n \n Heroin is still seen as the major drug threat to America's moral structure. Even though several participants pointed out that the addiction rate per-capita and resulting crime was infinitesimal when compared to cocaine or meth, smack is still #1. \n \n Ready for this? Marijuana is #2 on the federal drug threat list. Our county and most others in rural areas receive more federal law enforcement grant funds to fight pot than any other drug or public safety issue. They're encouraged to go after growers 'with all available resources due to the major threat marijuana usage presents to our society'. \n \n I thought our foreign policy was straight out of the dark ages, but this one really makes me wonder who or what is steering the ship.",

So we send troops to Columbia for fulfilling political agendas, pack our prisons with addicts and low level dealers and chase pot growers while cocaine management, other than a couple of high-profile cartels who threatened our puppet in Columbia, remained virtually untouched.",
