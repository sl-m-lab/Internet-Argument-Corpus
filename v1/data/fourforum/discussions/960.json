   "Maths can delve into possibilities. What are the possibilities that random selection could occur?\n \n \"The Wistar Institute Symposium (1966). A milestone meeting was the four-day Wistar Institute Symposium, held in Philadelphia in April 1966. A number of mathematicians, familiar with biological problems, spoke--and clearly refuted neo-Darwinism in several ways. An important factor was that large computers were by this time able to work out immense calculations--showing that evolution could not possibly occur, even over a period of billions of years, given the complexities of DNA, protein, the cell, enzymes, and other factors. \n We will cite one example here: Murray Eden of MIT explained that life could not begin by \"random selection.\" He noted that, if randomness is removed, only \"design\" would remain,--and that required purposive planning by an Intelligence. He showed that it would be impossible for even a single ordered pair of genes to be produced by DNA mutations in the bacteria, E. Coli (which has very little DNA), with 5 billion years in which to produce it. Eden then showed the mathematical impossibility of protein forming by chance. He also reported on his extensive investigations into genetic data on haemoglobin (red blood cells). Haemoglobin has two chains, called alpha and beta. A minimum of 120 mutations would be required to convert alpha to beta. At least 34 of those changes require changeovers in 2 or 3 nucleotides. Yet, Eden pointed out, if a single nucleotide change occurs through mutation, the result ruins the blood and kills the organism!

   "\"THE 1966 PHILADELPHIA MEETING \n It was not until the 1960s that the neo-Darwinists really began fighting among themselves in earnest. At Wistar, evolutionary theory was destroyed by mathematical facts. \n \"The ascription of all changes in form to chance has long caused raised eyebrows. Let us not dally with the doubts of nineteenth-century critics, however; for the issue subsided. But it raised its ugly head again in a fairly dramatic form in 1967, when a handful of mathematicians and biologists were chattering over a picnic lunch organized by the physicist, Victor Weisskopf, who is a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and one of the original Los Alamos atomic bomb group, at his house in Geneva. `A rather weird discussion' took place. The subject was evolution by natural selection. The mathematicians were stunned by the optimism of the evolutionists about what could be achieved by chance. So wide was the rift that they decided to organize a conference, which was called Mathematical Challenges to the Neo-Darwinian Theory of Evolution. The conference was chaired by Sir Peter Medawar, whose work on graft rejection won him a Noble prize and who, at the time, was director of the Medical Research Council's laboratories in North London. Not, you will understand, the kind of man to speak wildly or without careful thought. In opening the meeting, he said: `The immediate cause of this conference is a pretty widespread sense of dissatisfaction about what has come to be thought of as the accepted evolutionary theory in the English-speaking world, the so-called neo-Darwinian theory. This dissatisfaction has been expressed from several quarters.\"?*G.R. Taylor, Great Evolution Mystery (1983), p. 4. \n A milestone meeting was the Wistar Institute Symposium held in Philadelphia in April 1966. The chairman, *Sir Peter Medawar, made the following opening remark: \n \"The immediate cause of this conference is a pretty widespread sense of dissatisfaction about what has come to be thought as the accepted evolutionary theory in the English-speaking world, the so-called neo-Darwinian theory . . These objections to current neo-Darwinian theory are very widely held among biologists generally; and we must on no account, I think, make light of them.\"?*Peter Medawar, remarks by the chairman, *Paul Moorhead and *Martin Kaplan (ed.), Mathematical Challenges to the Neo-Darwinian Interpretation of Evolution, Wistar Institute Monograph No. 5. \n A number of mathematicians, familiar with the biological problems, spoke at that 1966 Wistar Institute. They clearly refuted neo-Darwinianism in several areas, and showed that its \"fitness\" and \"adaptation\" theories were tautologous?little more than circular reasoning. In contrast, some of the biologists who spoke at the convention could not see the light. They understood bugs and turtles, but could grasp neither the mathematical impossibilities of evolutionary theory nor the broad picture of how thoroughly defunct evolution really is. \n For example, one of the mathematicians, *Murray Eden of MIT, explained that life could not begin by the \"random selection,\" which is the basic pillar of evolutionary teaching. Yet he said that if randomness is set aside, then only \"design\" would remain?and that would require purposive planning by an Intelligence. \n *C.H. Waddington, a prominent British evolutionist, scathingly attacked neo-Darwinism, maintaining that all it proved was that plants and animals could have offspring! \n The 1966 Wistar convention was the result of a meeting of mathematicians and biologists the year before in Switzerland. Mathematical doubts about Darwinian theory had been raised; and, at the end of several hours of heated discussion, it was agreed that a meeting be held the next year to more fully air the problems. *Dr. Martin Kaplan then set to work to lay plans for the 1966 Wistar Institute. \n It was the development of tremendously powerful digital computers that sparked the controversy. At last mathematicians were able to work out the probability of evolution ever having occurred. They discovered that, mathematically, life would neither have begun nor evolved by random action. \n For four days the Wistar convention continued, during which a key lecture was delivered by *M.P. Schutzenberger, a computer scientist, who explained that computers are large enough now to totally work out the mathematical probabilities of evolutionary theory?and they demonstrate that it is really fiction. \n *Murray Eden showed that it would be impossible for even a single ordered pair of genes to be produced by DNA mutations in the bacteria, E. coli,?with 5 billion years in which to produce it! His estimate was based on 5 trillion tons of the bacteria covering the planet to a depth of nearly an inch during that 5 billion years. He then explained that the genes of E. coli contain over a trillion (1012) bits of data. That is the number 10 followed by 12 zeros. *Eden then showed the mathematical impossibility of protein forming by chance. He also reported on his extensive investigations into genetic data on hemoglobin (red blood cells). \n Hemoglobin has two chains, called alpha and beta. A minimum of 120 mutations would be required to convert alpha to beta. At least 34 of those changes require changeovers in 2 or 3 nucleotides. Yet, *Eden pointed out that, if a single nucleotide change occurs through mutation, the result ruins the blood and kills the organism! \n *George Wald stood up and explained that he had done extensive research on hemoglobin also,?and discovered that if just ONE mutational change of any kind was made in it, the hemoglobin would not function properly. For example, the change of one amino acid out of 287 in hemoglobin causes sickle-cell anemia. A glutamic acid unit has been changed to a valine unit?and, as a result, 25% of those suffering with this anemia die. \n For more information on the 1966 Wistar Institute, we refer you to the book quoted above, by *Moorehead and *Kaplan. For much more on mathematical problems confronting evolutionary theory.\"\n http://www.pathlights.com/ce_encyclopedia/20hist12.htm",

I'll keep you posted...\n \n \"THE 1980 NEW YORK MEETING \n For decades, men had to silently accept evolutionary theory in order to graduate with a doctorate and enter a field of science. Everywhere they turned in their chosen field, they see evidence of creation, not evolution. An ever-increasing explosion of knowledge in the sciences only added to the massive weight of evidence in favor of creation science. But, at last, careful researchers were beginning to openly scoff at evolutionary theory in professional journals. Leading paleontologists, such as *Gould and Stanley, were brazenly flaunting the foolishness of Darwin's legacy; but, unfortunately they were substituting strange new fairy tales that were utterly opposed to reality, common sense, genetics, mutational studies, or mathematical probabilities. Something had to be done. \n \n In October 1980, the world's leading evolutionists met in Chicago in a special Evolution Conference. \n \n \"The central question of the Chicago conferences was whether the mechanisms underlying microevolution can be extrapolated to explain the phenomena of macroevolution.\"-*Roger Lewin, \"Evolutionary Theory Under Fire,\" in Science, November 21, 1980. \n \n \"Microevolution\" is change within a species, but this is adaptation and not evolution, as most experts will admit. \"Macroevolution\" is change between species, and must always lie at the heart of evolutionary theory. Without macroevolution, evolution does not occur. At the 1980 Chicago meeting: \n \n \"In October 1980, . . a conference was held in Chicago on one of the hottest issues in evolutionary studies. The respected magazine, Science, organ of the American Association of the Advancement of Science, called it `a historic conference' which `challenges the four-decade long dominance of the Modern Synthesis.' `We all went home with our heads spinning,' said one participant. `Clashes of personality and academic sniping created palpable tension in an atmosphere that was fraught with genuine intellectual ferment,' Science reported.\"-*G.R. Taylor, Great Evolution Mystery (1983), p. 55. \n \n Open attacks were hurled at evolutionary theory, and men desperate for solutions sought for answers. \n \n \"Feuds concerning the theory of evolution exploded . . Entrenched positions, for and against, were established in high places, and insults lobbed like mortar bombs from either side.\"-*Francis Hitching, The Neck of the Giraffe (1982), p. 12. \n \n Yes, arguments took place, even some shouting. The conclusion of the majority was that there is no evidence of evolution, and we have no way of demonstrating that it is occurring now or has ever occurred. \n \n \"At the risk of doing violence to the positions of some of the people at the meeting, the answer can be given as a clear No.\"-*Roger Lewin, The Neck of the Giraffe (1982), p. 12. \n \n *Newsweek for November 3, 1980, carried an article on the Chicago meeting. You may wish to read it for yourself. The large majority of evolutionists at the conference agreed that the neo-Darwinian mechanism of mutation and natural selection could no longer be regarded by professionals as scientifically valid or tenable. Neither the origin nor the diversity of living creatures could be explained by evolutionary theory. \n \n A year later, *Robert Jastrow, a leading scientist wrote: \n \n \"To their chagrin [scientists] have no clear-cut answer, because chemists have never succeeded in reproducing nature's experiments on the creation of life out of nonliving matter. Scientists do not know how that happened . . Scientists have no proof that life was not the result of an act of creation.\"-*Robert Jastrow, The Enchanted Loom: Mind in the Universe (1981), p. 19. \n \n Of the scientists attending that meeting, some in desperation decided that the only solution was to join *Gould and *Stanley in viewing hopeful monsters as the means by which species change occurred! To coin a phrase that might be worthy of Shakespeare: \"Ah, desperation, thou hast made men mad.\" \n \n The 1980 meeting was held in Chicago's Field Museum and was attended by 160 of the world's top paleontologists, anatomists, evolutionary geneticists, and developmental biologists. \n \n \"[Evolution] is undergoing its broadest and deepest revolution in nearly 50 years . . Exactly how evolution happened is now a matter of great controversy among biologists . . No clear resolution of the controversies was in sight [at the meeting].\"-*Boyce Rensberger, \"Macroevolution Theory Stirs Hottest Debate Since Darwin,\" in The Riverside (California) Enterprise, p. E9; *Roger Lewin, \"Evolutionary Theory under Fire,\" Science, November 21, 1980, pp. 883-887. \n \n It was decided that no record would be kept of the sessions, in order not to give ammunition to the creationists. The rapid accumulation of evidence against evolutionary theory had brought a crisis of such proportions that most of those in attendance decided to repudiate a cardinal Darwinian doctrine; they agreed that small changes from generation to generation within a species could never accumulate to produce a new species. \n \n In its place, the Alice-in-Wonderland theory of \"punctuated equilibria\" was given prominence. This view teaches that sudden massive mutations produced \"hopeful monsters\"-and made all our modern species. It was at the 1980 meeting that the majority of leading scientists present decided in desperation to adopt the basic \"hopeful monster\" theory of *Goldschmidt, *Stanley, and *Gould. \n \n Men act as if they are chained to a cart and must go wherever it carries them. They dare not get off of it, for to do so is admit a terrible fact which they do not wish to consider. \n \n \"According to an article in Newsweek (November 3, 1980), at a conference in mid-October at Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History, the majority of 160 of the world's top paleontologists, anatomists, evolutionary geneticists, and developmental biologists agreed to abandon Darwinian evolution in favor of punctuated equilibria, otherwise known as the hopeful monster theory. \n \n \"Apparently, Darwin's theory had become indefensible to them, citing particularly the absence of intermediate fossils as the conflicting fact. The hopeful monster theory is a retreat to what appears to be reliable geological evidence, namely, the general stringing-out of fossils from `simple' to `complex' in the rock strata.\"-Randall Hedtke, \"Asa Gray Vindicated,\" in Creation Research Society Quarterly, June 1981, p. 74. \"\n \n http://www.pathlights.com/ce_encyclopedia/20hist12.htm",

   "I am struck by the disagreement and vagueness now of both sides...\n \n One evolutionary page says.. \"It is true that the sorts of dramatic macroevolutionary transformations that creationists ask for have never been achieved in a controlled environment of the laboratory (although some examples of speciation have been observed; however, one would be forgiven for thinking that debates about speciation seem uncomfortably similar to a variety of philosophical paradoxes related to vagueness). But advocates of the `fixed kinds' theory are willing to concede microevolution: they accept that mutations in two separated populations -- constrained by the conservative tendencies of natural selection and genetic drift -- can lead to variations over time within each group. Now suppose that each of these separated subpopulations faces very different and changing environmental pressures, including encounters with other populations of different organisms. Under these conditions, what is to stop the gradual changes in these subpopulations from leading to two distinct populations that can no longer interbreed? \n The `fixed kinds' theory offers no clear answer. Advocates of the theory cannot explain why some `kinds' are unchanging across enormous periods of time and profound environmental changes, while others appear and then die out quickly. The theory offers no guidance on what the specific genetic mechanisms are that prevent variations within a \"kind\" from eventually leading to changes in \"kinds,\" given the separation of populations and changes in their respective environments\"\n \n However, \"Evolutionists use straw man arguments to imply that creation teaches a 'fixity of species'. Materials from the Online Course for Teachers: Teaching Evolution is explicit: \"In Creationism, species are described as 'fixed' in the sense that they are believed not to change their form, or appearance, through time.\" In fact, creation does not deny speciation which is an important part of the model.\"\n http://www.creationfaq.net/\n \n I have read other creationist sites that seems to be going against the grain (see below). It accepts Speciation and claims that all the examples of speciation show rapid change, but within a type. There's no fish become humans, but rather a fish becoming another type of fish.\n \n But anyway...\n \n \"WHAT IS A SPECIES: \n The first problem, in discussing the origin of species is to define just what a species is. Complicating the definition of a species is the use in scientific literature of terms such as: neospecies, sibling species, incipient species, subspecies and semispecies. Until nearly the later half of this century, a species was considered to be any systematic unit classified as a species by a competent systematist. More often than not, morphology rather than ability to interbreed, was considered the primary determinant of a species. As a result of this approach, 10 potentially interbreeding varieties of Red Foxes were divided into ten separate \"species\" on the basis of color and geographical distribution. The Red Foxes are now considered to represent one species, Vulpes fulva, comprising 12 \"subspecies.\" Subspecies then is simply another name for varieties that may have morphological differences as a result of their geographical separation, but still can interbreed. Species showing great morphological variation, thus having many subspecies, are said to be polytypic. Small rodents are among the most polytypic mammals; the southern pocket gopher, Thomomys umbrinus, for example, has 214 subspecies! Homo sapiens, on the other hand, is considered to be a monotypic species as there is great reluctance, for obvious social reasons, to consider the various races of men to be subspecies (unless they are extinct and can't fight back like Homo sapiens, neanderthalensis). The modern definition of a species proper tends to ignore morphological differences or similarities and focus almost entirely on whether or not a population interbreeds. The evolutionist Francisco Ayala has defined a species as \"groups of interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups.\" By this widely accepted definition, two organisms could be morphologically and physiologically indistinguishable, and even capable of being cross bred in the laboratory producing fertile offspring, and yet be considered two different \"species\" by reason of their failure to interbreed in nature. Such populations are referred to as \"sibling species.\" By this definition of species there are over 6000 species of fruit flies (Drosophila) in Hawaii alone! Many of these fruit flies are morphologically indistinguishable and many do interbreed in the laboratory to produce offspring of varying degrees of fertility. Regrettably, the term species is not always used consistently today. The nearly 150 varieties of strikingly distinctive dog breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club are all considered to be members of the same species Canis familiaris because they all can cross breed, yet the grey wolf (Canis lupus) and the coyote (Canis latrans), themselves polytypic species, are considered to be different species though they are known to interbreed with dogs. Creationists have long felt a need for a classification that would include in one consistent category all organisms that interbreed under any conditions as well as obviously related animals that are currently reproductively isolated.\"\n http://emporium.turnpike.net/C/cs/species.htm\n \n The conundrum of species therefore is a difficult one for evolutionaries... yet though they state that species are hard to define, they are adamant that they know that new species have emerged! It is both proof and non-proof at the same time!\n \n \n Another interesting article can be found at \n http://www.parentcompany.com/creation_essays/essay4.htm\n \n Also...\n http://www.drdino.com/cse.asp?pg=articles&specific=4\n \n However...\n I am less sure that creationists claim that Speciation is Okay\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/459.asp.\n also\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v23/i2/speciation.asp\n \n http://www.creation-science-prophecy.com/biology/index.html\n deals further with a paradigm shift amongst some creationists.\n \n I hope that presenting different ideas enables you to be better informed.

A shift in the relative numbers of dark and light moths in a population is called evolution, and so is the creative process that produced the cell, the multicellular organism, the eye, and the human mind.\"\n\n It can be confusing to those who are inadequately educated in the issues at hand. The word has at least three meanings in evolutionary biology. \n \n One is the definition. I learned that evolution is a change in the frequency of alleles in a population over time. But I have seen other biologists take exception to this definition as too narrow and not encompassing all of evolution. For example, polyploidy events are fairly common in plants, and while the relative frequencies of the alleles hasn't changed, I can't think of a biologist who would reject this as evolution. Perhaps we should define evolution as a change in the genetic makeup of a population over time.\n \n Another use of the word is in reference to the observations of events that fit the definition. The observed changes in the peppered moth is an example of such events. It is evolution because the change is caused by changes in the genetic makeup of the population over time.\n \n Finally, there is the theories. Even though it is used in the singular, \"evolutionary theory\", the theory of evolution is really many theories that explain many facets of a complex subject. Each of these theories have to stand or fall on its own merit. It is possible to falsify a theory of evolution without casting any doubt on the larger, overall body of knowledge.\n \n By the way, Ernst Mayr dicerns 5 separate theories that Darwin stated in On the Origin of Species, each of which may be accepted or rejected independant of the others. Each has been tested and verified.\n \nDo you think evolution is over used? We could talk about the evolution of art, as an example, but the process has nothing to do with 'eye evolution'\n\n Yes. But the word had meaning outside of biology first. Often existing words are used in science but are assigned specific, limited meanings. Outside of biological science, the word doesn't refer to the theories of evolution. The word means change. In Darwin's day it even carried the implication that it was progress. That's why Darwin didn't like it applied to his theories. So biology can't demand that everyone stop using the word outside of biology. It is legitimate to talk of the evolution or the universe, or stelar evolution, or the evolution of art or music. Things change. But the theory of evolution refers to specific kinds of change in living organisms, as above. Moreover, there is no implication in progress, or increase in complexity, required increase in information, or new species.",
