You seem to think the Police can shoot people and never acknowledge any negative consequences of their actions- this is not the case, certainly not in the UK where firearms incidents are still rare. The very fact the apology has been made at all before an investigation has been conducted speaks volumes. Oh, and the Prime Minister has expressed his regret over the incident as well now.\n \n \nI would hope that they would be critical of all cases where lethal force was used, to determine in every case if the level of force used was appropriate, and to shape future policy. If it turns out to be an unjustified shooting, then I would hope that appropriate terminations and criminal charges are filed.

However, these actions did not only suggest the man could have been a bomber. As a matter of fact they were the action of a man whose visa had expired and was fearful of possible deportation. However the Officers have assumed he was a terrorist, assumed he had a bomb and assumed lethal force was the only option. Perhaps also there is a wider issue- it shows how careful the Police has to be in deployment of units that are trained to respond with lethal force- should such Officers been deployed in this instance? if they had been unarmed Mr Menezes would now be in Police custody and a fading memory to us all.\n \n \nIt could also let terrorists know that people are watching, and that they might not live to detonate their bomb if they are caught. The reverse side of this is that if this incident turns out to be unjustified, the police could have restrictions imposed on them that might just allow a bomber that couple extra seconds of opportunity that he needs to blow his bomb up.\n\n \n And now you understand my anger at this incident- mistakes like this could hamper the Police in the future.

   "They goofed up, however, at the point when you are dealing with a real suicide bomber there is no other tactic. Can't take the risk of tackling them, we know from extensive numbers of captured vests they have operator trips as well as pressure switches on the chests. Can't shoot them somewhere they won't be disabled by as they will just set it off. Can't shoot them in the chest as most explosives are shock sensitive and most people aren't rendered instantly incapacitated by chest shots. Head shots are the only option.",

   "Well, more has now come out about the shooting of Mr. Menezes some of which suggests there was a deliberate mis-information campaign to try cover over the actual nature of the incident.\n \n 1. Menezes was not wearing a \"heavy coat\" at all, but was dressed in a denim jacket.\n \n 2. He never vaulted any barriers.\n \n 3. He only ran to get aboard a departing tube train.\n \n More importantly he had been misidentified as Hussain Osman, a suspect associated with the bombings who was under survelience by Police. Also, the decision to use lethal force was taken in advance, in this instance if the \"suspect\" ran.\n \n Read more here.\n \n So I think I can return to my original analysis that this was a f*ck up that led to an innocent man being shot.",
