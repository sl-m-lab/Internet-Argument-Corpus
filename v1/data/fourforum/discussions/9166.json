After spending the last couple of weeks saying what horrible people Democrats are, and how they'll destroy the country if you vote for them, Bush is now trying to make amends, and Rummy is the sacrificial lamb. Which just forces you to wonder. If Rummy were actually any good at his job, or at least if Bush thought he was, then he wouldn't be so quick to give him the heave ho. But if Rummy is so expendable, then why was Bush pushing so hard to hang on to him?",

   "I wonder if Republican Central has said everyone is paid off for now (Rummy was the pharmaceutical company debt - Medicare prescription drug program), let's put in some fresh people who aren't despised by the general public to prepare for 2008? Rummy was still verbally gold to Bush just days ago ago, Afghanistan/Iraq is the primary political issue and both parties will have to run on a getting out plank preparing for 2008. Too bad VP is an elected position. \n \n Gates will be an interesting defense secretary. A career spook from the old school and Bush Sr man who got his current job by the gift of the Bush Sr library, how he'll cope with an almost hopelessly conventional Pentagon in an era of unconventional warfare solely dependent on intelligence will be a challenge.",

Every effort was then made to disengage the majority of US troops by placing them on remote bases, using air power and limited US military involvement to support Iraqi military and police actions, to reduce US casualties. Over the past few months Iraq insurgency reached a level where US troop presence was again required to avert a full civil war, resulting in record casualties and more bad press. I'd think the deals such as Rummy were cut in early October. Maybe Daddy Bush stepped in for damage control for 2008? He's bailed that son out of messes all the son's life.",
