My friend finally rented it himself so I watched it. It is one of the best movies I've ever seen, but that name just doesn't sit well with me for some reason.",

I really loved it. Then a few years later they advertised \"Beethoven\".... well I was shocked, it's about a big dog!\n \n (No, I didn't actually go an see it, but I was planning... on the strength of how good Mozart was).",
