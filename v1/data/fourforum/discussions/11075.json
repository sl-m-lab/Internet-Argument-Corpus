   "Alright everybody, I wanted to start a new thread to begin another discussion of D.C. v. Heller. Things are going to heat up quickly. \n \n Oral arguments are tomorrow in the case, and SCOTUS has announced it will make an expedited release of the recordings of the arguments (generally meaning the arguments will be available about an hour after they are made). \n \n The question presented when the writ was granted was this:\n \n Whether the following provisions-D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a77-2502.02(a)(4), 22-4504(a), and 7-2507.02-violate the Second Amendment rights of individuals who are not affiliated with any state-regulated militia, but who wish to keep handguns and other firearms for private use in their homes.\n \n At first glance the question presented appears to bias the issue in favor of an individual right interpretation, but I would not assume it until we hear how the justices react to the arguments.\n \n Here is a solid link to briefs already submitted in favor of both sides:\n \n http://www.gurapossessky.com/news/parker/pleadings.html \n \n The justices and their law clerks have already poured over these, and the justices have very likely already formed an opinion of how they will rule. It's not that important to hear the actual arguments being made because they will be little more than restatements of the briefs. Two things will be important to hear in the oral arguments: \n \n 1. The questions asked and comments made by the SCOTUS justices, because these will provide a glimpse of how the justices are thinking. \n 2. How the attorneys handle attacks made on their position by a skeptical justice. \n \n In order to answer the question presented I see the justices having to deal with two issues:\n \n 1. What is the nature of the right (individual/collective)?\n 2. Regardless of how you decide the nature of the right, are the challenged laws constitutional?\n \n There will be a lot of info available tomorrow evening. NPR in particular will most certainly devote a large portion of its evening \"All Things Considered\" program to coverage of the oral arguments. I'm not necessarily a fan of NPR, but their court coverage has always been excellent, and they almost always include audio of the justices' questions. \n \n ---\n \n The issue, however, is not whether court rules are \"mutable\"; they assuredly are. It is not whether, in the light of \"various circumstances,\" they can be \"modifi[ed]\"; they assuredly can. The issue is whether, as mutated and modified, they must make sense. The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.

   "Well here are my initial thoughts on the arguments. Feel free to agree, disagree, or expand upon them if you like. There are many, many details in the arguments that will take a long time to digest, but I think I have at least some poor opinion on how things went for the core individual v. collective right question. \n \n The collective \"states\" right interpretation didn't just lose yesterday-it got routed. \n \n Within seconds of starting his opening statement D.C.'s attorney announced D.C.'s abandonment of the collective right interpretation: \n \n What is at issue this morning is the scope and nature of the individual right protected by the resulting amendment and the first text to consider is the phrase protecting a right to keep and bear arms.\n \n D.C.'s argument appeared instead to try and limit the individual right damage by promoting a hybrid individual right to participate in militia promoting functions theory. \n \n Notably absent was any mention of the issue of whether individual citizens have the necessary standing to bring a 2nd. Amendment infringement claim.\n \n Here is how I see the Justices view the individual right/collective right question:\n \n Chief Justice Roberts, Justices Scalia, Alito, and critically Kennedy are all individual right supporters. Justice Thomas was either not present or if he was then he did not participate at all in the arguments. Thomas has always been an individual right supporter, however, and this gives the clear majority five needed for the individual right decision. \n \n Justice Robert's views become very important now. I believe he will be the one to write the majority individual right opinion. This is a legacy case for any justice, and Chief Justices almost always claim the honor of writing the majority opinion when they find themselves in the majority on landmark cases. Based on this, and on Robert's comments about the D.C. ban, I think the D.C. laws are doomed absent some defection by at least one of the above justices willing to say it's an individual right but D.C. can still effectively ban it. (Justice Breyer might be one to take that very approach, for example)\n \n I also think there will be more than five on board the individual right train.\n \n I think Justice Ginsburg will be an individual right supporter. One question in particular gives me this opinion:\n \n JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is a lot of talk about standards and stop words like strict scrutiny. Does it make a practical difference whether we take your standard or the strict scrutiny that was in the D.C. Circuit's opinion? And specifically there is a whole panoply of Federal laws restricting gun possession. Would any of them be jeopardized under your standard? And the same question with the District scrutiny, does it make any difference?\n \n To me this is an announcement that she favors an individual right interpretation and is ready to get down to the business of deciding the critical question of the standard of review. Whether she can reason out a way to keep the D.C. ban constitutional is another issue.\n \n I think Justice Breyer will also be an individual right supporter, albeit a very weak one likely to try and save the D.C. ban. Look at some of what he said:\n \n JUSTICE BREYER: ...I'd like you to assume two things with me, which you probably don't agree with, and I may not agree with them, either....But I just want you to assume them for the purpose of the question. All right. Assume that the -- that there is an individual right, but the purpose of that right is to maintain a citizen army; call it a militia; that that's the basic purpose. So it informs what's reasonable and what isn't reasonable. Assume -- and this is favorable to you but not as favorable as you'd like -- assume that we are going to decide whether something is proportionate or apply an intermediate standard in light of the purpose. All right.\n \n Here Breyer is careful not to say he agrees with the individual right opinion yet, but this whole question appears to me to be his way of floating an individual right protected by an intermediate review standard trial balloon. In particular, he later tries to reason out a way to keep an individual right view and still save the D.C. ban. Here are a couple of comments I found interesting on that point:\n \n But we give in both instances, then and now, leeway to the city and States to work out what's reasonable in light of their problems. Would that be a way of approaching it? \n \n [and after citing statistics of handgun related deaths and woundings...] Now, in light of that, why isn't a ban on handguns, while allowing the use of rifles and muskets, a reasonable or a proportionate response on behalf of the District of Columbia?\n \n Justice Souter gave indications he favored a narrow individual right view which ties the right closely to individual militia service. Here are some of his comments I found illustrate this point:\n \n JUSTICE SOUTER: May I go back to another point, which is to the same point, and that is consistent with your emphasis on the people was your emphasis a moment ago on the distinction between keeping and bearing arms. The \"keep\" part sounds in your, in your mind at least, to speak of an individual right not necessarily limited by, by the exigencies of military service.\n \n My question is, if that is correct and \"keep\" should be read as, in effect, an independent guarantee, then what is served by the phrase \"and bear\"? In other words, if the people can keep them and they have them there for use in the militia as well as to hunt deer, why do we -- why do we have to have a further reference in there to a right to bear as well as to keep arms? And my point is it sounds to me as though \"keep and bear\" forms one phrase rather than two. But I want to know what your answer is to that.\n \n But wait a minute. You're not saying that if somebody goes hunting deer he is bearing arms, or are you?\n \n But it's \"arms\" that has the kind of the military -- the martial connotation, I would have thought.\n \n Justice Stevens was in my opinion the lone holdout for the possibility of a collective right dissenting opinion. Here are some of his comments I found which make me believe he will write a collective state's right opinion:\n \n JUSTICE STEVENS: How do you explain the fact that you include self-defense, but only two States, Pennsylvania and Vermont, did refer to self-defense as a permissible justification and all of the others referred to common defense or defense of the State, and in the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution itself there is no reference to self-defense?\n \n JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think he was guided at all by the contemporaneous provisions in State constitutions? \n MR. DELLINGER: I am sure he was influenced by that, although I think, honestly -\n JUSTICE STEVENS: And how many of them protected an individual right? Just two, right? \n GENERAL CLEMENT: I think -- I think Pennsylvania and Vermont are the ones that most obviously protected.\n JUSTICE STEVENS: And the others quite clearly went in the other direction, did they not?\n \n JUSTICE STEVENS: You say that the right of self-defense was the heart of the Second Amendment, in your view. Strangely that some provisions suggested that and were not accepted by the authors of the Second Amendment.\n \n The bottom line for me is that \"we,\" the individual right supporters, have won this case. So we can now take a moment to yell \"Yeah! We won! We won!\" But soon enough we will have to ask \"just what did we win again?\" SCOTUS still has to grapple with the scope of the right (what arms are protected, what conduct with protected arms is protected) and what test it will apply to review claims of infringement.",

   "Thanks, steeeve. \n \n After reviewing this it seems like the court is leaning toward an individual rights interpretation. Personally I am a little surprised at how strongly Kennedy seems to feel about it. I had never seen any comments from Kennedy in the past on this, but it almost seems that he is willing to take a stronger stance on this than even Scalia, whose position was pretty predictable. \n \n I am a little disappointed with the arguments by Hellers side. It seems like at several points the justices are leaning toward a \"strict scrutiny\" type standard and Hellers attorneys are arguing against it. I also found the entire discussion about machine guns there to be nonsensical. It relied on a circular logic that just did not make any sense at all. \n \n Steeeve, you have spent quite a bit of time studying not only the current court, but the individual personalities there. I think that the stance thomas is likely to take is pretty clear....individual right, strict scrutiny, bring on the rocket launchers and damn the consequences. What do you think about the other justices?",

I am just trying to figure out what the heck we won. It almost seems like some of the justices were more inclined toward declaring the law a fundamental one than were Hellers attorneys. I believe that once it became apparent that the court had more or less decided the individual vs collective right view that it was time to argue for fundamental status and strict scrutiny. Instead it seemed like they were pretty much just begging for individual right and virtually no protection whatsoever outside of a prohibition on outright bans. That is pretty pathetic.\n \n Frankly in the end I think we are pretty much going to have to depend strictly on the justices own views and the briefs that were filed on this one because \"our side\" put up a pretty pathetic argument when it came to how the right should be viewed and what restictions should be permissible.",

   "Care to try to read the tea leaves on this one Bryan??\n \n Personally I doubt we will see the strict 5/4 decision that some seem to be expecting. Like you, I think that it will be more like 8-1 or even 9-0 in favor of an individual right, with disagreement as to what the scope of that right is and what constitutes a reasonable restriction on that right. \n \n A lot has been made by the antis of Roberts statements about not having to establish an all encompassing standard. A lot of them seem to think that means the court is going to \"punt\"....not lay down a decisive ruling. I personally did not read it that way. Roberts has complained in the past about the first amendment having \"baggage\" because of the various tests, provisions, and conditions that have been placed on it over the years that were meant to provide \"guidance\" in interpreting it but instead just turned it into a confusing mess. The way I read his comments what he was essentially saying was that he wanted to avoid a mess like that with this ruling. \n \n I think that part of the confusion there (if it exists) is that he talks about comparing todays laws to those that existed at the time of the writing and seeing how they compare, and he tossed out one particular law about not taking guns to the market. While I agree that particular law would seem to indicate more gun control is permissible than some would prefer (though certainly not all of us...those of use with common sense recognize that there are some places that having people carrying guns is a poor idea), I still do not see it as particularly constricting of the right. I also think those folks need to keep in mind that when we are comparing todays laws to those of yesteryear, we are talking about comparing our laws to people who LITERALLY put people in jail for failing to posses and maintain a suitable rifle of the type in common military usage. \n \n While I can understand a collective sigh of relief that there was not a push at strict scrutiny in the oral arguments by any of the justices, I somehow doubt that a standard of review (if we do end up with this as a standard of review) where we compare our laws to those of a bunch of revolutionaries who had jsut overthrown their government is going to work out very well for the antis. If that is what we end up with, they may well end up wishing they had something as flexible as strict scrutiny to work with.",
