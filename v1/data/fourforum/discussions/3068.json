The reason is that polls make it very clear that the vast majority of votes will go to one of those two parties.",

The answer I believe lies in finding a viable third party candidate. Ross Perot was the closest by far. However, he was so closely aligned in policy with the republicans that he took a large chunk of the republican vote. Splitting them made it much easier for the democratic party.\n \n The candidate has to be one that carries more than 33 1/3% of the vote. So far most third party candidates have carried less than 20%. Enough to split, not enough to win. The candidate would need to appeal to both parties. NOne currently do. It is usually one or the other.\n \n The best bet is to get a third party candidate in with one of the major parties, then to switch to a third party after winning the election (Jumping Jim Jeffords).",

   "As far as getting a third party as a force in the long term, that is a big discussion. But as far as this year's election is concerned, if you live in a swing state, vote for either Kerry or Bush (actually Kerry wink wink, nudge nudge), but if you live in a state where the outcome is certain (such as Kansas or Mass.), like I do, then vote for a third party candidate. Someome said on here (as many have said elsewhere) that with our current system, it is never viable to vote for a third party candidate, but how do you think it would be possible for a 3rd party candidate to become viable? The only way is by voting for that person and getting them in the spotlight. If we want change, we have to make it ourselves, we can't expect it to just happen.",
