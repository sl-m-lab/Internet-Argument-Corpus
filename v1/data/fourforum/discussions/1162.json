   "Montalban my friend;\n \n You stated where the church used the name pope before the eight Century, do you know what the word Pope means, [Father of the Church], just has their were fathers of believers in the whole old testament.\n\n \n So? Didn't you read all of what I wrote? Other churches use the title 'Pope' as well. Why do you think it has special meaning in one circumstance and not in others? It has no special prominence, no more so than the head of the True Church are the Patriarchs. Pope/Patriarch all derived from 'father'.\n \n \nTell me where it states the word [Trinity ] in Scripture which also did not come till much later in the church ,but we use it has a different name for the father, son. holy spirit, or other titles like the mother of God and so on that came much later also,so this argument is a waste of time.\n\n \n Again, so? I am not a sola fide Christian. I am one who believes in Holy Tradition. Catholics unilaterally altered the doctrine of the Nicene Creed to say that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and also from the Son\n \n And yet, you also make exceptions to this doctrine! Anytime the Pope visits one of the Uniat Churches (those that follow the Eastern Rites), they say the Creed in its original form; thus when the Pope visits, he too says it in its original form.\n \n The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son, but there is only one Godhead.\n \n Even early Popes realised this truth\n \" Pope Leo III (795-816) intervened, and forbade any interpolations or alterations in the Nicene Creed. He ordered the Creed, without the FILIOQUE, to be engraved in Latin and Greek on two silver plates on the wall of St. Peter's in Rome. By doing so, he avoided a direct confrontation with the East. However, the FILIOQUE continued to gain ground in the West. \"\n http://www.thefathershouse.org/creed/filioque.htmlhttp://www.thefathershouse.org/creed/filioque.html\n \n You're absolutely changed this situation\n \n Now if you want me to quote Scripture you're going to have to as well!\n \n \nAs for the leadership of the Church, the Catholic Church has the right to do what is good to keep the doctrines of faith in place from the pope and his bishops who back him up.\n\n \n Says who? The Pope. Circular reasoning. Show me which Ecumenical Council gave the Pope this right.\n \n Look at the history of the church. The first council is shown in Acts. Everyone argued, Paul stood up to Peter. The first \"Ecumenical Council\" was held in the suburbs of Constantinople - not Rome! The Roman bishop had to come east. The doctrines drawn up there were also given the proviso that they couldn't be unilaterally changed; they'd need another Council to do so. The Pope later ignored this.\n \n \nFor Christ said to Peter, whatever you bind and lose will be bound and loosened in heaven.\n Do you think that Christ made this command of truth only too Peter just his life span and gone with the wind when he died, no,, for Christ said I will be with you till the end of time will not leave you has orphans.\n\n \n No, not at all. The Church still continues to this day. Peter's church lives! It is the Orthodox Church.\n \n \nYou sholud (sic) read your bible a little more clearly on athority (sic) and who we must hear, not your own private interpretations and beliefs, I do not need to show you for I could give many verses that support a one athority (sic) church.\n\n \n Why? Which verses? I think you don't know what you're talking about here, quite frankly.\n \n \nWhat does the bible say whom divisions are made from, it shure (sic) is not God,look at the thousands of different churches out there, they all claim to be the truth from the word, but the problem is ,there is one holy spirit, one truth.\n\n \n So? The Roman Church are the first Protestant Church, when they broke away from Orthodoxy and made it their decision to interpret things for themselves. Then others split from them!\n \n \nSo if any one states that the Roman Catholic Church fell in 313AD ,they call Christ a liar, for he said,hell will not prevail against his Church, so if the Church fell has many Christians claim Satan did prevail did he.\n\n \n A pap response, a jingo, is not an argument. Your line here works perhaps on a Protestant. Your ignorance of Orthodoxy shows by the fact that you'd use it on me. I don't make any such claim that the church fell then. The Orthodox Church was founded at Pentecost and continues to this day.\n \n \nYou bring up that we Catholics believe Mary was without sin,she was to have the Son of God in her, for how could Christ be born from a sinner, would that make him a born sinner for we all come from are mothers womb so that makes us born sinners due to Adam and Eve.\n\n \n Mary was not born from a sinner. Mary however was not born sinless. By a special grace of the fact that she conceived Jesus within her she was saved. The fact that she still needed Jesus to be saved is what Orthodox maintain. Catholics say she was conceived without sin; therefore she didn't need Jesus.\n \n Catholics and Protestants are the extremes of the issue of Mary.

   "So? Didn't you read all of what I wrote? Other churches use the title 'Pope' as well. Why do you think it has special meaning in one circumstance and not in others? It has no special prominence, no more so than the head of the True Church are the Patriarchs. Pope/Patriarch all derived from 'father'.\n \n \n \n Again, so? I am not a sola fide Christian. I am one who believes in Holy Tradition. Catholics unilaterally altered the doctrine of the Nicene Creed to say that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and also from the Son\n \n And yet, you also make exceptions to this doctrine! Anytime the Pope visits one of the Uniat Churches (those that follow the Eastern Rites), they say the Creed in its original form; thus when the Pope visits, he too says it in its original form.\n \n The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son, but there is only one Godhead.\n \n Even early Popes realised this truth\n \" Pope Leo III (795-816) intervened, and forbade any interpolations or alterations in the Nicene Creed. He ordered the Creed, without the FILIOQUE, to be engraved in Latin and Greek on two silver plates on the wall of St. Peter's in Rome. By doing so, he avoided a direct confrontation with the East. However, the FILIOQUE continued to gain ground in the West. \"\n http://www.thefathershouse.org/creed/filioque.htmlhttp://www.thefathershouse.org/creed/filioque.html\n \n You're absolutely changed this situation\n \n Now if you want me to quote Scripture you're going to have to as well!\n \n \n \n Says who? The Pope. Circular reasoning. Show me which Ecumenical Council gave the Pope this right.\n \n Look at the history of the church. The first council is shown in Acts. Everyone argued, Paul stood up to Peter. The first \"Ecumenical Council\" was held in the suburbs of Constantinople - not Rome! The Roman bishop had to come east. The doctrines drawn up there were also given the proviso that they couldn't be unilaterally changed; they'd need another Council to do so. The Pope later ignored this.\n \n \n \n No, not at all. The Church still continues to this day. Peter's church lives! It is the Orthodox Church.\n \n \n \n Why? Which verses? I think you don't know what you're talking about here, quite frankly.\n \n \n \n So? The Roman Church are the first Protestant Church, when they broke away from Orthodoxy and made it their decision to interpret things for themselves. Then others split from them!\n \n \n \n A pap response, a jingo, is not an argument. Your line here works perhaps on a Protestant. Your ignorance of Orthodoxy shows by the fact that you'd use it on me. I don't make any such claim that the church fell then. The Orthodox Church was founded at Pentecost and continues to this day.\n \n \n \n Mary was not born from a sinner. Mary however was not born sinless. By a special grace of the fact that she conceived Jesus within her she was saved. The fact that she still needed Jesus to be saved is what Orthodox maintain. Catholics say she was conceived without sin; therefore she didn't need Jesus.\n \n Catholics and Protestants are the extremes of the issue of Mary. One gives her too much, the other too little.\n \n \n \n How can something that is Holy be born in something that is evil , us humans due to sin , think about it.\n \n When was she cleansed? Catholics maintain this was at her conception. We maintain it was at the time she conceived Jesus; thus she still needed Jesus to be saved.

   "Montalban,\n I am surprised at you. You are twisting Catholic doctrine as badly as an extreme fundamentalist.\n \n Here's what you said on Catholic belief in the Virgin Mary:\n \n \nMary was not born from a sinner. Mary however was not born sinless. By a special grace of the fact that she conceived Jesus within her she was saved. The fact that she still needed Jesus to be saved is what Orthodox maintain. Catholics say she was conceived without sin; therefore she didn't need Jesus.\n \n No, you've made her out to be someone who attained grace without Jesus! (before he was conceived). This has diminished the role of Jesus.\n \n the Immaculate Conception - which actually insults Jesus, by claiming that Mary didn't need to be saved by Him\n \n On Mary: Mary didn't need to be saved reaccuse Catholics claim she was conceived without Sin. She therefore was a special case, where-by she didn't need saving. Further, Catholics have risen her to the rank equal to Jesus, that of co-redemptress.\n\n \n Mary has NEVER been given the same status as Jesus in the Catholic Church. You do not understand the idea of co-redemptrix if you think she does. Furthermore, the Catholic Church has never stated that Mary did not need a savior. We do NOT say she didn't need saving. We would NEVER insult Jesus in that way, we do not bind his power in the same way that others do. Where do you get your information?\n \n Think of Mary's salvation like this:\n \n Consider this allegory. You are walking along a remote path in the woods that is unfamiliar to you. Suddenly, you lose your footing and fall in a huge pit that was covered with leaves and branches. As much as you struggle and fight, you cannot get out of the pit by yourself. A park ranger hears your cries for help and he comes along and pulls you out of the pit. The ranger has just saved your life. You surely would have perished in the cold with no shelter, food, or water. A short time later, the park ranger sees someone coming up the path and he jumps in front of her just as she is about to fall in the pit. He grabs her and pulls her aside, telling her of the danger. Has the park ranger saved both of you? Yes. \"Mary is not sinless by her own power, virtue, or merit. It \n was not her merits but those of her Son, which were applied to her at conception. The primacy and necessity of the Incarnation and Christ's fullness are not diminished by Mary's Immaculate Conception, because more than any other human being, she received of his fullness (John 1:16).\" Jesus saved Mary just as he saves us. He just chose a different time frame with her. (modified from Stephen Ray)",

   " I do not think the Church has embraced modernism as a philosophy. But I don't believe you are saying that. You are saying that the Church has applied the revelation of God that came to us through Jesus to modern times. We are in the world, not of the world as many say. Have I gotten your meaning correctly?\n\n \n It really depends on your definition of modernism. You can state my theses in a different way, but it means the same. I would agree that the post-VII Church has embraced modernism; not to the extent of changing our theology, but more to the extent of tuning much of our old ways. The Trinitine mass needed to be \"tuned\", as there were many errors in it's liturgy. \n \n \n Don't get me wrong. I do not see anything wrong with Mass in the vernacular as long as the form of the liturgy is preserved. But there is also a beauty of the Latin language to be appreciated. At any rate, Mont is probably not talking about language but rather form.\n\n \n Of course. I personally prefer the Latin mass over the vernacular (I am very traditional in that manner). However, I do believe that a vernacular liturgy is necessary for all to fully understand the mass, and not only those who know Latin. Even in the beginning of the Church, when the apostles spread throughout the known world, they preached with languages of the civilization there. Thomas preached to the Hindus in an Indian dialect (not Hindi), Peter probably preached in Latin, and Matthew preached in Greek. Certainly Christ intended all to know about him, and not only those who speak Aramaic. Do you agree?\n \n \n Parcum, musical instruments are not part of Orthodox worship.\n\n \n Yes, like most of the Eastern Catholic Rites. \n \n \n Yes, you might find an exceptional 'liberal' Orthodox, but I think this is more of an exception, whereas in Catholicism, the form of the Liturgy doesn't really matter. There are special Masses for kids where in the priest performs most of the ceremony, but the kids dole out the Eucharist to each other. This is not common itself, but what is the rule is that there are so many different types of Mass; Latin, Modern, Trendy, Children's etc.\n\n \n Although masses especially for children are allowed, they shouldn't be on the altar. I find this disrespectful. I don't know where the Church stands on this (I wouldn't call it a \"sin\", although it is disrespectful), but I do know that several parishes including my own do this (I even did it when I was younger, I was a poor ignorant soul, wasn't I?). Again, I don't condone it. \n \n \n Modernism is a cancer in both churches. However, it is futher embedded in Catholicism, where we're now to the point where in Catholicism there are even Charismatic Catholics.\n\n \n I don't like Charismatic Catholics (I know the president of the San Francisco Charismatic group), but again it's spreading Christ in ways that some people, although very different. The main problem I have with these modernist groups is their disrespect towards the Eucharist. \n \n \n The Pope ( Pius XI) said that believing in Evolution was not in conflict with Catholicism [or creationism].\n\n \n It doesn't. \n \n \n In Orthodoxy the Eucharist is given sub utraque specie (that is of both kinds; body and blood). In Catholicism, the laity are denied both. This despite \"It may be stated as a general fact, that down to the twelfth century, in the West as well as in the East, public Communion in the churches was ordinarily administered and received under both kinds\"\n\n \n If I am correct, the theology of the Catholic Eucharist is that when you recive either the body (in the form of Bread) or blood (in the form of wine) of Christ, you are receiving the body, blood, soul, and divinity of Christ. \n \n \n The form of baptism in Catholic churches involves a sprinkling of water. In Orthodoxy it involves full immersion, symbolic of re-birth, as the child emerges whole from the water. This was practices across Christendom, until Catholics changed it in their own domain.\n\n \n Don't see a problem.",

   "An open challenge to all Catholics reading...\n \n Show me where the teachings are that allow for the Bishop of Rome to be supreme.\n \n Why Rome? Why not Antioch - the first bishopric headed by Peter?\n \n As Drac is unwilling to do this, I hope that someone else might take up the challenge.\n\n \n Mont, \n \n We have discussed that the teachings begin in scripture but I have already addressed that. Why not Antioch? Because everyone in the Church acknowledges that Peter established his succession at Rome. The Roman Church has been acknowledged as the head church since the beginning. Even those in Antioch acknowledged it. It's for this simple reason that it is held as the place of primacy by the Catholic Church.\n \n Ignatius of Antioch\n \n \"Ignatius . . . to the church also which holds the presidency, in the location of the country of the Romans, worthy of God, worthy of honor, worthy of blessing, worthy of praise, worthy of success, worthy of sanctification, and, because you hold the presidency in love, named after Christ and named after the Father\" (Letter to the Romans 1:1 [A.D. 110]). \n \n \"You [the church at Rome] have envied no one, but others you have taught. I desire only that what you have enjoined in your instructions may remain in force\" (ibid., 3:1). \n \n Why is the bishop of Rome supreme?\n \n Jerome\"I follow no leader but Christ and join in communion with none but your blessedness [Pope Damasus I], that is, with the chair of Peter. I know that this is the rock on which the Church has been built. Whoever eats the Lamb outside this house is profane. Anyone who is not in the ark of Noah will perish when the flood prevails\" (Letters 15:2 [A.D. 396]). \n \n \"The church here is split into three parts, each eager to seize me for its own. . . . Meanwhile I keep crying, 'He that is joined to the chair of Peter is accepted by me!' . . . Therefore, I implore your blessedness [Pope Damasus I] . . . tell me by letter with whom it is that I should communicate in Syria\" (ibid., 16:2). \n \n Optatus\n \n \"You cannot deny that you are aware that in the city of Rome the episcopal chair was given first to Peter; the chair in which Peter sat, the same who was head-that is why he is also called Cephas ['Rock']-of all the apostles; the one chair in which unity is maintained by all\" (The Schism of the Donatists 2:2 [A.D. 367]). \n \n \n Pope Julius I\n \"[The] judgment [concerning Athanasius] ought to have been made, not as it was, but according to the ecclesiastical canon. It behooved all of you to write us so that the justice of it might be seen as emanating from all. ... Are you ignorant that the custom has been to write first to us and then for a just decision to be passed from this place [Rome]? If, then, any such suspicion rested upon the bishop there [Athanasius of Alexandria], notice of it ought to have been written to the church here. But now, after having done as they pleased, they want to obtain our concurrence, although we never condemned him. Not thus are the constitutions of Paul, not thus the traditions of the Fathers. This is another form of procedure, and a novel practice. ... What I write about this is for the common good. For what we have heard from the blessed apostle Peter, these things I signify to you\" (Letter on Behalf of Athanasius [A.D. 341], in Athanasius, Apology Against the Arians 20-35). \n \n Cyprian of Carthage\n \n \"The Lord says to Peter: 'I say to you,' he says, 'that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church.' . . . On him [Peter] he builds the Church, and to him he gives the command to feed the sheep [John 21:17], and although he assigns a like power to all the apostles, yet he founded a single chair [cathedra], and he established by his own authority a source and an intrinsic reason for that unity. Indeed, the others were that also which Peter was [i.e., apostles], but a primacy is given to Peter, whereby it is made clear that there is but one Church and one chair. So too, all [the apostles] are shepherds, and the flock is shown to be one, fed by all the apostles in single-minded accord. If someone does not hold fast to this unity of Peter, can he imagine that he still holds the faith? If he [should] desert the chair of Peter upon whom the Church was built, can he still be confident that he is in the Church?\" (The Unity of the Catholic Church 4; 1st edition [A.D. 251]). \n \n Ephraim the Syrian\n \n \"[Jesus said:] Simon, my follower, I have made you the foundation of the holy Church. I betimes called you Peter, because you will support all its buildings. You are the inspector of those who will build on Earth a Church for me. If they should wish to build what is false, you, the foundation, will condemn them. You are the head of the fountain from which my teaching flows; you are the chief of my disciples. Through you I will give drink to all peoples. Yours is that life-giving sweetness which I dispense. I have chosen you to be, as it were, the firstborn in my institution so that, as the heir, you may be executor of my treasures. I have given you the keys of my kingdom. Behold, I have given you authority over all my treasures\" (Homilies 4:1 [A.D. 351]). \n \n Then you will say, \"Yes, Peter has been given the primacy of honor not the primacy of authority.\" But these men do not speak of honor alone but also of authority. Furthermore, Christ was not speaking of honor when he established the Church on the Rock of Peter. He was speaking of authority by giving him the keys and the power to bind and loose. \n \n But then you will say. These writings are too few. I do not take the writings of just of one man (nor does the Catholic or Orthodox Church. That is why I have supplied you with the writings of many privately). But after I supply you with the writings of many then you will say that no councils who legislate these matters give testimony but here is the testimony of councils:\n \n Council of Sardica\n \n \"[I]f any bishop loses the judgment in some case [decided by his fellow bishops] and still believes that he has not a bad but a good case, in order that the case may be judged anew . . . let us honor the memory of the apostle Peter by having those who have given the judgment write to Julius, Bishop of Rome, so that if it seem proper he may himself send arbiters and the judgment may be made again by the bishops of a neighboring province\" (canon 3 [A.D. 342]). \n \n \"[I]f some bishop be deposed by the judgment of the bishops sitting in the neighborhood, and if he declare that he will seek further redress, another should not be appointed to his see until the bishop of Rome can be acquainted with the case and render a judgment\" (canon 4). \n \n Council of Ephesus\n \"Philip, presbyter and legate of [Pope Celestine I] said: 'We offer our thanks to the holy and venerable synod, that when the writings of our holy and blessed pope had been read to you, the holy members, by our holy voices, you joined yourselves to the holy head also by your holy acclamations. For your blessedness is not ignorant that the head of the whole faith, the head of the apostles, is blessed Peter the apostle. And since now [we], after having been tempest-tossed and much vexed, [have] arrived, we ask that you order that there be laid before us what things were done in this holy synod before our arrival; in order that according to the opinion of our blessed pope and of this present holy assembly, we likewise may ratify their determination'\" (Acts of the Council, session 2 [A.D. 431]).",

Did you know that Protestants ministers also molest children? Recently I heard of a Methodist Minister who was caught molesting a 13-year-old in San Francisco. Is it really just Catholics who have the problem?\n \n The reason why the Catholic Church is the one true church lays on our incorrupt doctrine (hence, there are no possible ways to beat it biblically, as it has already been studied extensively), and the continuous succession of Popes since Peter's martyrdom (Linus to JP2). The corruption in the Church only fortifies the already great evidence for our truth; Satan wants to attack anything Christ founded.

   "Epaphras,\n I know you have been reading some parts of the Catechism of the Catholic Church lately. Read Paragraphs 846, 847, 848 for a further explanation of the Church's necessity for salvation.\n \n Also, I think the presentation of the writings of the early Christians/Church Fathers were not a re-hashing but rather a new aspect of the debate. (At least between you and me).\n\n \n Maximus: Thank you for directing me to the chatechism. I found it very enlightening. I have copied here a portion that, to me, indicates that schisms in the church were brought about by sin on both sides and resulted in the splits. It also indicates that those that are baptised and justified by faith are considered brothers.\n \n 817 In fact, \"in this one and only Church of God from its very beginnings there arose certain rifts, which the Apostle strongly censures as damnable. But in subsequent centuries much more serious dissensions appeared and large communities became separated from full communion with the Catholic Church - for which, often enough, men of both sides were to blame.\" 269 The ruptures that wound the unity of Christ's Body - here we must distinguish heresy, apostasy, and schism 270 - do not occur without human sin: \n \n Where there are sins, there are also divisions, schisms, heresies, and disputes. Where there is virtue, however, there also are harmony and unity, from which arise the one heart and one soul of all believers. 271\n 818 \"However, one cannot charge with the sin of the separation those who at present are born into these communities [that resulted from such separation] and in them are brought up in the faith of Christ, and the Catholic Church accepts them with respect and affection as brothers .... All who have been justified by faith in Baptism are incorporated into Christ; they therefore have a right to be called Christians, and with good reason are accepted as brothers in the Lord by the children of the Catholic Church.\" 272 \n \n 819 \"Furthermore, many elements of sanctification and of truth\" 273 are found outside the visible confines of the Catholic Church: \"the written Word of God; the life of grace; faith, hope, and charity, with the other interior gifts of the Holy Spirit, as well as visible elements.\" 274 Christ's Spirit uses these Churches and ecclesial communities as means of salvation, whose power derives from the fullness of grace and truth that Christ has entrusted to the Catholic Church. All these blessings come from Christ and lead to him, 275 and are in themselves calls to \"Catholic unity.\" 276 \n \n The portions before this section also point to the catholic church as one body with Christ as the head. The word catholic here I believe means universal as I unsderstand it. If that is the case, then even now as a protestant, I would consider myself a part of the church, the universal church. I am a member of the body of Christ. This answers some questions in other threads as well.\n \n I actually see very little that we differ on, especially when I read the catechism. I find it difficult to argue. The areas of disagreement I think are more of degrees than complete disagreement.",

   "[QUOTE=montalban]Firstly, I didn't start this! Drac did by having a go at Orthodoxy. I will not take this lying down. I told him what he said was provocative (I said \"Them's fightin' words\").\n \n \n \n If Mary was without sin before Jesus came into her, then why does she need to be 'saved'?\n \n \n \n The doctrine of the Immaculate Conception is not part of Orthodox Tradition (nor Catholic Tradition for 1,800 years).\n \n As to her being raised along side Jesus, the idea of the co-redemprtess is gaining ground:\n \n http://zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=21475\n \n Further \"On March 22, 1918, Pope Benedict XV said, \"She suffered so much for us, almost to the point of dying with Her suffering and dying Son. Therefore we may rightfully say that she has, with Christ, redeemed the human race.\"\n http://www.primepropertyofga.com/aog/false/FAL421.HTM\n \n There are several other faults that are major with Catholicism;*\n \n The lessening of the power of the liturgy; the Catholic Mass' form is not of any concern, so that in some churches you have rock 'n' roll. Others you have children offering up the Eucharist.\n http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/Strasse/5816/trad.html\n \n Catholics have allowed Far Eastern practices into the Church such as yogic meditations.\n \n Catholics make exceptions to undermine Orthodoxy.\n On the issue of married clergy, the filioque, and the form of the Liturgy, the Catholic Church has made concessions so as to draw Orthodox into its embrace. So whilst a Roman Catholic priest is forbidden from marriage, A Maronite Catholic can. Also, the Catholic church waives this rule to entice Anglicans to defect.\n \n Catholicism has, despite some outsider views, embraced modernism. Through Vatican II (http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/Strasse/5816/intro.html)\n \n You can now get an annulment from the Catholic Church as easy as pie.\n \n \n *I can go over faults within Orthodoxy, but I'm sure Drac will point them out.[/QUOT\n \n \n \n Montalban;\n \n Tell me my friend, where in the Church teachings does it State the Blessed Virgin Mary did not need Christ for Salvation after she bore him or before.\n \n You are twisting things around, when we state the blessed mother was without sin ,is when she bore Christ what the Church teaches..\n \n The Church states Mary was without sin to bore the son of God ,for God made a human who was clean from sin before Christ was born,Christ had to be born from a sinless vessel.\n The Church does not say she did not need Christ has her salvation after the fact his birth or death on the cross.\n \n I am shure the blessed Mother had the Holy Spirit to guide her not to sin even after Christ died.\n \n A Mother who bore the son of God, I think would of lived a holy life before and after Christ came , for it was planted in her by the spirit before she was born.\n \n With God ,all things are possible, and with the Church ,it truths come in time revealed by the spirit too the Church.\n For the Church could not handle all truths at once, for there are many things that Christ said and done that all the books of the world could not contain in that time.\n So truths are revealed in time, for where does it say in the bible that the Apostles recieved all truths during their time on earth, for they only revealed truths that Christ spoke and other truth came later, for the Catholic Church was like babes with milk in that time frame during the deciples time line on earth ,the church was just learning my friend from the spirit.\n \n Going back to the Blessed Holy Mother of God.\n How can Christ be born of a sinner with sin, would that not make him a born sinner has we are born from our Mother who is a sinner due to Adam and Eve.\n \n For that is Holy cannot dwell with that is evil. \n \n \n \n As for Childern offering the Eucharist, I have never seen it in any church most of my life in Canada or in the states and I have been to many many Catholic churches.\n \n \n Peace Drac",

   "Killacozzy;\n Tell me my friend, give me one church that has no sinfull people who do no wrong.\n\n \n A church is only as good as the people who \"interpret\" for the common folks. If you look at the history of the Roman Catholic Church, the \"word\" has been twisted by its leaders and clergy to their advantage. The church in its original form may have been the \"truth\", as so many would like to call it, but there is no doubt that it is now far from it. And since the idea of a church is a group of people who offer spiritual guidance and assistance to each other, this church is led by liars, cheats, and, yes, sinners.\n \n Yes, \"sin\" is everywhere, but when one claims that a certain church offers the only salvation-the only valid version of scripture-and that church has distorted the interpretation of written word, added its own amendments and clauses, and edited and/or deleted key books (such as the Gospel of Thomas), you're basically saying that the only true church is the harlot.\n \n \n\n Just because there are Priest who molested childern does that mean they all do, do not think there are no molester's in any other church in your own family you may not know, there everywhere my friend.\n\n \n I agree that the molestors alone aren't evidence of unreliability on the part of the church. But when the spiritual leader (the pope) does it, lies, and covers it up (as has happened all throughout the history of the papacy), what kind of guidance is truly offered? Am I really going to heaven as long as I agree with what a degenerate says?\n \n And if you truly believe that the laws of Catholicism are the same as when the church first started, look again. Those same popes altered documents and created false notions, such as the idea that Mary Magdelene was a prostitute (she was not) or that the apostle Thomas was an idiot for doubting Christ (in fact, he was Jesus' most loved, since he basically had the balls to *GASP* think for himself).\n \n \n\n So if you are going to spread lie's to other's with his kind of stuff that you have no real proof on,maybe you should read Rev 21;27 what happens to those who spread lie's of the church ,Protestantism spread many, I have heard lots from them.\n \n\n \n You can't base the \"truth\" off a scripture that has been translated to and from a gazillion different languages. Quote as many Bible passages as you can; it doesn't really change that much between Christian denominations. So if you can say \"read this passage, you'll see what happens when you talk XXXX about my church\", so can the Protestants. And the Episcopals. And the Baptists.\n \n But the Catholics are the only ones who are right. Because they say they are.\n \n \n\n Cast the first stone at us if you think your Church is without sin, but in second thought ,you all ready have.\n \n\n \n In the scriptural sense of the word, yes, I have committed sin. I'm not preaching that any church is right. I'm just saying that the Catholics aren't any moreso than the Protestants, Baptists, or Mormons. In fact, who's to say that Christianity is the end all, be all? Everyone in a religion thinks they're right. I'm not going to hell because I refuse to buy into the Catholic dogma.\n \n \n\n Also The Protestant moment began due to private interpretation from Luther, look at all your divisions, most came from within themselves because they all could not agree on the word and at the same time they all say they speak truth, how many holy spirits do protestant divisions have anyway.\n\n \n You're right. It's all about personal interpretation. What's the problem with that? If God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-seeing, why do you think that God would cast someone down who didn't listen to the Pope? The church should not take precedence over the ideas presented in the books. If anything, the Bible is a parable, of sorts, that should teach all closed-minded people about true belief and conviction.\n \n The ideas in the Gnostic books are the best presented of all Christian documents yet. Read them. Or better yet, don't. It's only benefitial to those who think for themselves, not with the aid of old Polish royalty (king of the Vatican, right?).\n \n Come back at me.",

By this I mean that I did all things with a desire to please Him, let what would come of it.\"\n \n -Brother Lawrence \n \n \n A faith in G-d not a faith in the pope, the catholic empire, or any other human ideals agreed upon by the papal council...\n \n \n \n \n How can one man no matter how Holy he says he is tell another what is G-d and what is not?\n \n \n \n We are all Shephereds\n \n \n \n There is no other dutch reformed, there is no other baptists, no other episcopalian, no other any individualised sect. You limit your knowledge to a church that put a lot of its doctrine in place to raise obidient armies!\n \n \n \n Never said the Catholic Church is wrong... But niether are the protestants, the Jews, the Bhuddists, Hindus, Muslims, etc. You are wrong we all believe in ONE AUTHORITY and that authority is not neccessarilally a pope. All paths up the same mountain!\n \n \n \n Didn't Martin Luther leave the catholics due to corruption?\n \n \n \n The truth is right were we stand! And that is the place called Heaven!!\n \n \"I believe in heaven! But I don't believe in heaven as a place somewhere else. Heaven is everything transfigured by God's presence. Therefore, for many people heaven starts right here, and for many people, hell starts here. Life that is transfigured by love and compassion and wisdom is heaven. It's not complete heaven, but it's a beginning.\"\n \n Brother David Steindl-Rast\n \n \n \n Are not Catholics not watered down?\n \n \n \n \n \n Rev 1:20\n \n \"20 The mystery of the seven stars, which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches. And the seven candlesticks are the seven churches. \"\n \n \n Seven different churches? Which one is yours? Are you sure it is the right one?\n \n \n Also:\n \n John 14:2 \"In my Father's house there are many mansions.\"\n \n \n \n hmm......\n\n \n \n HellHound;\n Which of the seven Chruches are we; I will tell you;\n Rev 3;7;13 \n The Holy one, the true,who wields david's key,who opens and no one can close, who closes and no one opens................and so on.\n \n So you see my freind;\n Who is called the Holy Church by name, who was given the keys from Christ,who was given the power to bind and loose and who keeps the words of Christ, no other Church has this then the Roman Catholic Church.\n Has I said your divisions did not come till 1500 years later to claim you are the Church of Christ, we can, you guys should take the covering over your eye's off, for Protestantism change the words of Christ not Catholic ,the proof shows in Protestantism\n \n You also say there are no splits in Baptist and others out there, did you know there are 25 splits in the baptist alone,how did Protestantism get so big then , 95 percent of the divisions did not come from the Catholic church they came within themselves, take a look at the world books that states there are 28000 different Christian organizations out there.\n \n You say that the Pope said there is no hell just in the mind, I love how you people pick and choose what you want to hear has you do with scripture, maybe you should read the whole thing what the Pope was really saying, not one linners which you people are good at.\n \n When you say, [are not Catholics watered down ], yes some are, but again you twist what I am really speaking about, not each Catholics beliefs on the church ,but the very core teaching in the athority of the Church which Protestantism do not have.\n \n Like said in the past, the Pope as over 3500 bishops that back him up on truths of Scripture. No Protestant Church has this, Orthodox is not included for they are close to to us when it comes to truths and even they have athority who the people must hear.\n \n You also bring up Luther, Luther was so confused on matters of faith he did not know where to turn at time's ,read the facts on luther instead of your one linner.\n Did you know, that Luther himself on his death bed said, that he would rather be with the Pope in Rome then be with his followers who with him at the time.\n These things are recorded and the facts should Luther was a confused man,so dig much deeper my friend instead of hearing lie's from others out there who are wolves in sheep clothing who are so anti Catholic the spread their errors.\n \n I am not Anti Protestant for I have many friends who are Protestant, but the fact is most of them do not know history of the Church and follow their own beliefs from the words from each organization, with Roman Catholic Church you know where they stand on doctrines of faith, no picking and choosing with them on truth that sits in the very core of her.\n \n So hellbound say what you want, you have no proof to Show the Catholic Church is not of Christ or his Church, you need to dig much deeper my friend instead of following your own personal beliefs has Most Protestant organizations follow [ Private interpretation] Read Peter 1;20 on this by interpreting scripture on their own , do you follow what it states, no .\n \n \n I am not attacking Protestants for they are Christians also, but their errors of what a true church is, not divisions,and private interpretation and so on on Gods words that they say is Symbolic, for scripture plainly show it is not of God but the work of Satan.\n \n \n WHERE IS THE ONENESS IN TRUTH IN PROTESTANTISM, WHO HOLDS IT BY THE WORD,WHO HAS THE ONE HOLY SPIRIT OF TRUTH. \n \n Peace Drac",

   "Rev. Hellhound,\n \n I do not wish to align myself with the abrasiveness of Drac. I do, however, wish to interject some ideas in response to several assertions you and killacozy have made:\n \n \nNope, no one after 1500+ years of medeling can be the see all be all in this truth you seek.\n\n \n There has never been \"meddling\" in the Church's teaching on faith and morals. It has remained constant for 2000 years.\n \n \nA faith in G-d not a faith in the pope, the catholic empire, or any other human ideals agreed upon by the papal council...\n\n \n Catholics have faith in God. Catholics trust the pope as the vicar of Christ. If you say that we are idolizing the pope then you are mistaken. We believe in the Church and in the pope only in so far as they were established by God as good and necessary.\n \n \nHow can one man no matter how Holy he says he is tell another what is G-d and what is not?\n\n \n The pope does not tell Catholics what God is. He simply transmits the meaning of what God has revealed to us. He does not generate novel and whimsical ideas on God. He elaborates on the revelation already given us.\n \n \nWe are all Shephereds\n\n \n That may be true. But Peter and his successors are shepherds in a special sense. John 21:15-23.\n \n \nJohn 1:1 \n \n \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\"\n \n What was this word? Or was it simply sound.... Sound is vibration. We vibrate.... Are we not in G-d's image? The Kingdom of Heaven is within you..\n\n \n How do you interpret that John 1:1 speaks of sound or vibration? The Word that John describes was Jesus, the living Word.\n \n Do you really believe that the host is anything more than a piece of bread! If so tell me why you believe this.\n \n Catholics are not bound solely by scripture being that Holy Tradition and the teaching authority of the Church must also be followed. However, the fact that the host becomes more than simple bread and wine can be found in scripture. Look at 1 Corinthians 10:16, 1 Corinthians 11: 23-29, and John 6.\n \n \nI never critisized you or your church in fact I even alluded that YOU ARE RIGHT! WE ALL ARE RIGHT! It is quite an egotistical thing to really believe to know G-d better than other people/religions...I only asked you if you believed that graham cracker and grape juice was truly the blood of Jesus de Christo I did not indicate whether I believed it so or not...corrupt power hungry individuals who have manipulated the reality of G-d for 1500+ years to suit thier needs\n\n \n Now criticism is fine, as long as it is constructive and not ad hominem. You say you have not criticized the Church yet you use generalizations that state that it is egotisitical, power hungry, and corrupt? You say that we have manipulated the reality of God? You use what I perceive to be somewhat inflammatory descriptions--graham cracker and grape juice??\n \n \nYou limit your knowledge to a church that put a lot of its doctrine in place to raise obidient armies!\n\n \n What do you imply here? Christ was obedient unto death. What is wrong with obedience to truth?\n \n I must also ask if you are Jewish. Or is there another reason that you do not spell the name of God? (This is not necessarily relevant to the debate so you can choose not to answer. I was just curious).\n \n On the Gospel of Thomas...it was unreliable historically and corrupt with the heresy of Gnosticism.\n \n Peace.",

The Catholic church has \"archived\" thousands of documents on G-d, Jesus de Christo, etc. etc. etc. all from the prying eyes of the \"faithful\" Why? \n \n \n \n\n Catholics have faith in God. Catholics trust the pope as the vicar of Christ. If you say that we are idolizing the pope then you are mistaken. We believe in the Church and in the pope only in so far as they were established by God as good and necessary.\n \n\n \n \n Of Course they do. I understand the relationship of the pope to the Catholic Church. I also understand that certain individuals take this too far as we have seen in using thier church thier G-d to dismiss others as un spiritual.\n \n \n\n The pope does not tell Catholics what God is. He simply transmits the meaning of what God has revealed to us. He does not generate novel and whimsical ideas on God. He elaborates on the revelation already given us.\n \n\n \n According to the agenda of the Catholic Church. This pope has said some very insighful things that have been out of the mainstream. He also failed to act with the molestation cases. I believe he is a good man and a Holy man, but a falable man like us all. But I do believe that the Catholic church hides very insighful documents from the world.\n \n \n \n\n That may be true. But Peter and his successors are shepherds in a special sense. John 21:15-23.\n\n \n Of course they were. but do you really believe that G-d somehow segragates the modern holy man from a Bhuddist? The Dali-Lama for example would cast this peaceful Holy Man into the lake of fire simply from recieving the wrong parents?\n \n \n \n\n How do you interpret that John 1:1 speaks of sound or vibration? The Word that John describes was Jesus, the living Word.\n \n\n \n What is Word? It is breath+vibration. This very passage describes not only Jesus de Christo but the very creation itself! Open your mind for a moment and reflect on this....\n \n \n\n Do you really believe that the host is anything more than a piece of bread! If so tell me why you believe this.\n \n Catholics are not bound solely by scripture being that Holy Tradition and the teaching authority of the Church must also be followed. However, the fact that the host becomes more than simple bread and wine can be found in scripture. Look at 1 Corinthians 10:16, 1 Corinthians 11: 23-29, and John 6.\n \n\n \n As I said I understand that. I also respect those beliefs. Personally I know (IMHO) icons, and hosts, and all the trappings us mortals have attached to G-d mean nothing to the Universal. \n \n \n \n\n Now criticism is fine, as long as it is constructive and not ad hominem. You say you have not criticized the Church yet you use generalizations that state that it is egotisitical, power hungry, and corrupt? You say that we have manipulated the reality of God? You use what I perceive to be somewhat inflammatory descriptions--graham cracker and grape juice??\n \n\n \n Not really even criticism. I have great respect for the Catholic church. I did not say YOU per say have manipulated the reality of G-d but I do contend that the leaders of your church have done so as does all religions have over the course of time. Look at the Bhuddists selling reincarnations to the likes of Steven Seagal! The Catholic church as I contended before hides documents from its and the worlds people! I ask again why?\n \n The graham cracker and grape juice according to you is just that right? until it is declared \"the body of Christ\" right? I am only stating the things which even you hold true am I not? If anything I am further seperating the Holy from the mundane am I not?\n \n \n \n\n What do you imply here? Christ was obedient unto death. What is wrong with obedience to truth?\n\n \n What makes you so sure it is the truth when the church (as is the world) is run by falable men? Could not ONE corrupt individual take the church off its path? I am not saying it has but it is possible and therefore (IMHO) the truth must be sought by the self.\n \n \n\n I must also ask if you are Jewish. Or is there another reason that you do not spell the name of God? (This is not necessarily relevant to the debate so you can choose not to answer. I was just curious).\n \n\n \n \n No problem. I am not a Jew at all. I am an ordained minister of a non-denominational church. I use G-d for several reasons. 1. To show the absurdity of the liberal blitz on anything that has to do with G-d in the christian sense. 2. To protest the constant removal of G-d from our lives in schools (i.e. moments of silence for childeren IF THEY WISH to pray not bible classes). Did you know there are public schools that set aside rooms for Muslims to pray yet if a Christian wants to do the same they can be suspended? The Constitution oddly enough is only supposed to put limits on Government... But latley it seems its the other way around. Also from certain Christian and other faiths the belief is that we would be rather arrogant to label G-d. Like Bhuddist enlightenment (sorry bout the continued references to Bhuddism... I just finished study of a years worth of thier materiel and it is still fresh in my head) enlightenment can not be fully described. But from what I can tell you I have seen it in the eyes of some Lamas, reborn Christians, Catholics, and protestants..... The old black preacher whos \"got the spirit in him!\" is the easiest example of this Joy... Ask any of them to describe it... All you will get is something that can be synonomous to \"The Kingdom of Heaven is within you!\". Do you have childeren? How did you feel when they were baptised? That right there is the Kingdom of Heaven! Its a trapping of Christians but one that can make you feel very close to G-d. A shimmer of the eternal light! Another example I understand how Stonewall Jackson was able to stand so in the middle of battle like a \"stonewall\". He said 'It is quite easy, it is in Gods hands'. They say in combat you very quickly find G-d. I never gave that a second thought. And when it did come to me it came in a way that I never could have fathomed. I have been in battle and seen the suffering of mans blinding indiference to his fellow man and I too (well not exactly like a stone wall) grew a sense of spirituality that i can not describe. We are all part of G-d and everything was going to be allright (whether I fall or not). This allowed for me to work with a sense of spiritual calm with my fellow brothers at arms that can only be described as divine guidance! At that moment with volleys of bullets flying overhead men on both sides down... I smiled..... I smiled not because of the carnage or some silly glory of battle. I smiled because I have seen the worst of man and knew that all IS forgiven... Everything is gonna be all right... It was as if for a very moment when I looked into the enemies eyes I saw the very face of G-d. Then I pulled the trigger....\n \n \n Specifically for the most part I do not subscribe to any organized religion I have a protestant upbringing and have a bit of a Christian Mystic in me. This Christian Mysticism reconciles the world to me. It explains to me how spiritual people from all backgrounds are equal before G-d.\n \n \n \n\n On the Gospel of Thomas...it was unreliable historically and corrupt with the heresy of Gnosticism.\n \n Peace.\n\n \n \n This is the EXACT position of the Catholic Church. Is it heresay to G-d or to the Church? I for one have found this Kingdom of heaven. It is right were we stand! The mountains the oceans, the creatures and the drive for liberty. Have you read the Gospel of Thomas? Have you read any of the other writings of that time? Again not to critisize your faith but how can the path be sure if it is guided by falable men? Again if one of these falable men corrupted the church long ago are you all doomed?\n \n This is a portion the Catholic empire did not like:\n \n 2) Jesus said, \"Let him who seeks continue seeking until he finds. When he finds, he will become troubled. When he becomes troubled, he will be astonished, and he will rule over the All.\"\n \n \n 6) His disciples questioned Him and said to Him, \"Do you want us to fast? How shall we pray? Shall we give alms? What diet shall we observe?\" Jesus said, \"Do not tell lies, and do not do what you hate, for all things are plain in the sight of Heaven. For nothing hidden will not become manifest, and nothing covered will remain without being uncovered.\"\n \n \n \n I truly believe when one \"lets go\" of all beliefs and builds from the ground up one can truly find thier path. It could very well be the Catholic church for some but I for one won't decide on a faith and tell others they are wrong...\n \n \n \n \n \n Reverend Hellh0und",

   "HellHound;\n You say you did not attack me once, you attack the Catholic Church ,you attack me my friend, for I hear what the Catholic Chruch speaks on truth of the word of God, not my personal beliefs, the Pope is not my thinker for me, he is are athority with the 3500 bishops who back him up on truth of scripture.\n \n\n \n \n Ahh I see you have gone back to Hellhound.... It's a start ;) Now my brother where have I attacked YOU? I only questioned the roots of your faith. You are free to do the same (as you are) with me. I have nothing to fear or hide! We should all look within ourselves and our beliefs always. As I said in another post and will elaborate here. I have great respect for the Catholic Church and its teachings. I love the tradition and the beutiful architecthure... I was married in a catholic church. MOST (99.999%) priests I believe are good holy men. The problem was with the leaders such as Cardinal Law looking the other way... Is this how a shephered tends to his flock? Men are falable and the Catholic Church as all churches are run by men. This is where I believe the reflection on self discovery needs to arise.\n \n \n\n The Catholic Church my friend holds full truth from the word no other organization, I am not saying that other christian churches do not hold truth from the word, some they do, for they got the basics about Christ from the Catholic church who preserved Scripture through time, without them you would have no bible ,so to get back what I am saying , how can Protestantism hold full truth when they all the divisions out there cannot agree on the word of truth from organization to organization and so on.\n\n \n There are many paths up the mountain. You preach one of seclusion I am preaching one of inclusion. \n \n Jesus said: Seek, and you will find; but the things you asked me in those days and I did not tell you then, now I desire to tell them, but you do not ask about them. \n \n \"perhaps the right time to ask questions and seek answers is when we are afraid to ask questions and seek answers. If we are not afraid, perhaps we do not know what we are asking and, this being so, the answer would be of little use to us. In the search the question and answer become, perhaps, two sides of the same coin.\n - Brick in the wall\"\n \n \n \n\n HellHound I am not here to convince you that I am right,I am here to show the many errors of Protestantism and to show you why we Believe what we believe from Catholic teachings and one of them you brought up was the host saying it is plain bread,if you want to speak on this matter ,I would be glad too, I gave you two verses in my last post to you, start from there if you wish.\n \n\n \n But how can you be sure of YOUR truth and that all others are wrong! G-d has been interpreted and reinterpreted over and over again by falable men?\n \n \n\n Sorry if I sound mean and sorry if I hurt what I said to you ,but that is the way I speak my friend, I do not tip toe through the tulips, I state it the way it is on matters of the Christian faith the way people follow it and believe when they turn from many verses that support a one athority church and turn from 1500 years of history and the fathers of the church, and some facts from the words of Christ they water down.\n \n \n Peace Drac\n\n \n \n No need to apologize. I view expecting an apology as a sign of a weakness. I understand your passion but I do not share your views of the Catholic church being the only path up the mountain! \n \n \n The Dialogue of the Savior\n \n \"The Lord picked up a stone and held it in his hand, saying \"What am I holding in my hand?\" \n He said, \"It is a stone.\" \n He said to them, \"That which supports the earth is that which supports the heaven. When a Word comes forth from the Greatness, it will come on what supports the heaven and the earth\"",

   "Are you accusing the pope of being a molester and degenerate?\n\n \n I know nothing of the current pope, but during the Renaissance, it's quite apparent how corrupt the \"One True Church\" had become. The spiritual leaders at this time were certainly \"molestors and degenerates\", and I wouldn't doubt if the current leaders weren't still a bit flawed.\n \n The trouble with the church structure is that one man, or group of men, inherently imperfect, decide what the good books mean. They take them to be literal. They smite the non-believers. No matter what, this pride and absolute belief in a certain truth creates a superiority complex in the members of said church, which in turn creates the Crusades, the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, the Holocaust. Basically, when people feel they're right and someone else is wrong, that wrong person becomes associated with bad, maybe evil, which should be hated, discriminated, or even eliminated.\n \n My beef is not with the belief system, but in the idea that the belief system is the \"one true church\". It's merely the truth for some. And for me, I could believe in Satan worship. But I will still know heaven, for the truth of the \"kingdom\" is an inner thing. I just can't handle beliefs that teach \"believe the word\" and really mean \"believe in this version of what the word means\". Drac, you're a XXXXX. And guess what? You don't hold the only truth.\n \n \n\n I believe there is great contrast in the teachings of many Christian denominations.\n\n \n The Bible is pretty much the same in every church of Christianity. And even though \"denominations\" exist, those factions don't really teach anything that differs much from anything else. Same stuff, different name. Holy Spirit, Kingdom of God, the blessings of the saints, the grace of the Virgin Mary, the salvation of Jesus Christ. Same XXXX. Just like heaven, enlightenment, valhala, nirvana.... it's all the same. Quit trying to cram one version down people's throats, telling them it's the only truth. It's not.\n \n \n \nThe Church does not teach that you will...unless of course you come in contact with the teachings and then reject them in spite of their truth.\n\n \n I reject Christianity for the most part, certainly Catholicism. I think it's arrogant for any spiritual person to declare that if I reject your specific take on the truth, on the word, that I'm going to hell. No one goes to hell (who does things that are against their own personal dogma??)\n \n \n \nDo you believe in the Gnostic tenet that matter is evil and spirit is good?\n\n \n Who taught you that? All things are made of the same stuff: God power! Everything is made from energy. Energy is, in turn, God. How can God be evil? THERE IS NO EVIL. Only knowledge gained through experience. Do you think Hitler saw himself as evil? Nope. He's prolly chillin' in his own heaven now with an Aryan girl on each arm. Nothing you can do is wrong, as long as you don't believe it is wrong.\n \n Now, I know, this creates a problem for society. But society is the one who put all the words in god's mouth.

   "I know nothing of the current pope, but during the Renaissance, it's quite apparent how corrupt the \"One True Church\" had become. The spiritual leaders at this time were certainly \"molestors and degenerates\", and I wouldn't doubt if the current leaders weren't still a bit flawed.\n \n The trouble with the church structure is that one man, or group of men, inherently imperfect, decide what the good books mean. They take them to be literal. They smite the non-believers. No matter what, this pride and absolute belief in a certain truth creates a superiority complex in the members of said church, which in turn creates the Crusades, the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, the Holocaust. Basically, when people feel they're right and someone else is wrong, that wrong person becomes associated with bad, maybe evil, which should be hated, discriminated, or even eliminated.\n \n My beef is not with the belief system, but in the idea that the belief system is the \"one true church\". It's merely the truth for some. And for me, I could believe in Satan worship. But I will still know heaven, for the truth of the \"kingdom\" is an inner thing. I just can't handle beliefs that teach \"believe the word\" and really mean \"believe in this version of what the word means\". Drac, you're a XXXXX. And guess what? You don't hold the only truth.\n \n \n \n The Bible is pretty much the same in every church of Christianity. And even though \"denominations\" exist, those factions don't really teach anything that differs much from anything else. Same stuff, different name. Holy Spirit, Kingdom of God, the blessings of the saints, the grace of the Virgin Mary, the salvation of Jesus Christ. Same XXXX. Just like heaven, enlightenment, valhala, nirvana.... it's all the same. Quit trying to cram one version down people's throats, telling them it's the only truth. It's not.\n \n \n \n \n I reject Christianity for the most part, certainly Catholicism. I think it's arrogant for any spiritual person to declare that if I reject your specific take on the truth, on the word, that I'm going to hell. No one goes to hell (who does things that are against their own personal dogma??)\n \n \n \n \n Who taught you that? All things are made of the same stuff: God power! Everything is made from energy. Energy is, in turn, God. How can God be evil? THERE IS NO EVIL. Only knowledge gained through experience. Do you think Hitler saw himself as evil? Nope. He's prolly chillin' in his own heaven now with an Aryan girl on each arm. Nothing you can do is wrong, as long as you don't believe it is wrong.\n \n Now, I know, this creates a problem for society. But society is the one who put all the words in god's mouth. He didn't say, \"Listen or suffer!!!\" Rules are to create a streamlined and unchaotic system. And in order to do that, a ruler needs to create a generic system of right and wrong. For example, murder is not necessarily bad. We justify it all the time during war. But in order to create a sense of safety, community, and control, kings made killing wrong. A crime.\n \n But everything is God. So if God is also murder, killing, death, how could God be evil?

But I'm not weak... I AM GOD.\n\n \n No, you are not God, for which I am truly thankful. Truth is not relative. If it was then it is not truth but rather opinion. The fact that you rebel is proof that God exists. You are wrong. \n \n To say no one is wrong is like saying that if I just believe long enough a candy bar will appear on my desk. I can get whole groups of people to believe it with me, I can form unions and hold potlucks concerning the coming of the great white chocolate, but unless it is true all of that will be for naught. \n \n Seek truth. Do not just say that there is no such thing. You will find that philosophy makes you miserable.",

   "The fact that you rebel is proof that God exists.\n\n \n Please!! Elaborate. I don't understand how my different belief proves that God exists in a form contrary to my own truth.\n \n \nTo say no one is wrong is like saying that if I just believe long enough a candy bar will appear on my desk. I can get whole groups of people to believe it with me, I can form unions and hold potlucks concerning the coming of the great white chocolate, but unless it is true all of that will be for naught.\n\n \n A small piece of bread is only a piece of bread. And wine is only wine. Yet Catholic practice asserts that through belief, this substance becomes the body and blood of Jesus. And all throughout Christian history, people have had amazing things happen based on belief. Miracles and such.\n \n Now, concentrating on the desk and imagining a candy bar may not cause one to appear, but I could very well see one in my own vision. A mirage, if you will. And if I were to be truly famished, I may possibly be able to \"touch\" this candy bar. Maybe even taste it. From your perception, it does not exist. But from mine, it is very real.\n \n Of course, the idea that all truth is a matter of everything is hard to grasp. In order to understand the idea that everything is truth, that everything is possible is quite, well, impossible. But I know (even though I can't exactly explain it with feeble language) that God is everything. God could not spontaneously appear from Nothing. So clearly, this God has always been. Matter could not appear from nowhere. In fact, matter is something that cannot be created or destroyed. It either changes form or becomes energy. So since God and matter have always existed.... hmm.... maybe this dual system is in fact the same. God is matter. God is all things. So, what is truth, when everything is comprised of God-niblets? Ah, my friend, truth is truth. God is God. Life is life. How can evil or good exist? Perception varies from person to person. If all people are parts of a whole (God), then how could one be right and one be wrong? The answer is simple: it's not that way. Everything is just what it is. Enjoy it.\n \n \n \nSeek truth. Do not just say that there is no such thing. You will find that philosophy makes you miserable.\n\n \n I have asserted that all things are truth. Look into noetic energy. That's where science comes into the picture of belief.\n \n And by the way, I'm quite happy. I like to think that my own divine energies control my fate as opposed to a certain purpose proposed by some throned old god. Sometimes, when I believe in myself, my life takes off to new levels. No belief in a foreign dogma has ever produced results like FREEWILL and FREEMIND.\n \n Sweetness.",

   "Reverend Hellhound,\n \n \nI disagree. The Catholic church has \"archived\" thousands of documents on G-d, Jesus de Christo, etc. etc. etc. all from the prying eyes of the \"faithful\" Why?\n \n \n You would have to give me some examples of which documents are hidden so I might respond as to why they have been hidden (but maybe that is impossible according to your assertion). If this is not possible then perhaps you can tell me what has led you to believe that the Church has archived thousands of documents to keep them from the eyes of the faithful.\n \n \nAccording to the agenda of the Catholic Church. This pope has said some very insighful things that have been out of the mainstream. He also failed to act with the molestation cases. I believe he is a good man and a Holy man, but a falable man like us all. But I do believe that the Catholic church hides very insighful documents from the world. \n \n \n What supposed agenda of the Church have you come up with? The agenda of the Catholic Church is to be a visible sign of Jesus Christ in the world. The agenda of the Catholic Church is to go out and make disciples of all nations as Jesus commanded. The agenda of the Church is to convey charity by feeding the hungry, caring for the sick, and helping for the poor. I too believe the pope is a fallible man. That is the teaching of the Church. He does, however, proclaim faith and morals infallibly as a result of the protection granted by Jesus Christ. Why do you believe that the Church hides insightful documents from the world? How did this conspiracy theory develop? Or have you been reading the DaVinci code?\n \n \nOf course they were. but do you really believe that G-d somehow segragates the modern holy man from a Bhuddist? The Dali-Lama for example would cast this peaceful Holy Man into the lake of fire simply from recieving the wrong parents? \n \n \n Why would you think I believed that a Buddhist would be cast into fire for being born? This is not the teaching of the Catholic Church. You may be confusing Catholics with some Baptists who believe that unless one is a baptized Christian then he cannot be saved. Read the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) paragraph 842-847:\n \n 842 The Church's bond with non-Christian religions is in the first place the common origin and end of the human race: \n All nations form but one community. This is so because all stem from the one stock which God created to people the entire earth, and also because all share a common destiny, namely God. His providence, evident goodness, and saving designs extend to all against the day when the elect are gathered together in the holy city. . .\n \n 843 The Catholic Church recognizes in other religions that search, among shadows and images, for the God who is unknown yet near since he gives life and breath and all things and wants all men to be saved. Thus, the Church considers all goodness and truth found in these religions as \"a preparation for the Gospel and given by him who enlightens all men that they may at length have life.\"\n \n 847 This affirmation is not aimed at those who, through no fault of their own, do not know Christ and his Church: \n Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or his Church, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and, moved by grace, try in their actions to do his will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too may achieve eternal salvation.\n \n Does this sound like seclusion or inclusion? Catholics appreciate the brotherhood of all but we proclaim that the fullest unity of this brotherhood resides in the Catholic Church. What Church is more universal and inclusive than the Catholic Church? You can find it in any nation, language, culture, or race on earth. \n \n \nWhat is Word? It is breath+vibration. This very passage describes not only Jesus de Christo but the very creation itself! Open your mind for a moment and reflect on this.... \n \n \n Your scriptural exegesis is a huge stretch of what the original meaning of John's writing was. Who came up with this? The Gospel of John is an attempt to convey Christ's deity. Look further to John 1:14  and it will confirm that Jesus is the Word of which John speaks. \"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth; we have beheld his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father.\"\n \n \nAs I said I understand that. I also respect those beliefs. Personally I know (IMHO) icons, and hosts, and all the trappings us mortals have attached to G-d mean nothing to the Universal. \n \n \n I'm not sure what you mean when you say that these things mean nothing to the \"Universal.\" You are a Unitarian Universalist? This brings up more questions: Are you a Christian or simply a theist? Do you accept the Bible as the Word of God? What do you think of Jesus' claims to be God? Give me more detail on your position. How were you ordained as a minister and by whom?\n \n \nThe graham cracker and grape juice according to you is just that right? until it is declared \"the body of Christ\" right? I am only stating the things which even you hold true am I not? If anything I am further seperating the Holy from the mundane am I not? \n \n \n Bread and wine would be more appropriate.\n \n \nWhat makes you so sure it is the truth when the church (as is the world) is run by falable men? Could not ONE corrupt individual take the church off its path? I am not saying it has but it is possible and therefore (IMHO) the truth must be sought by the self. \n \n \n No, a corrupt man cannot take the Church off of its path because Jesus promised to the Church he established that the gates of hell would not prevail against it (Matthew 16:18). He said that the Counselor would guide the Church into all truth (John 16:13). The self cannot be the seeker of truth without guidance.\n \n \nSpecifically for the most part I do not subscribe to any organized religion I have a protestant upbringing and have a bit of a Christian Mystic in me. This Christian Mysticism reconciles the world to me. It explains to me how spiritual people from all backgrounds are equal before G-d.\n \n \n I can appreciate the Christian mystic. Catholicism has many. The mystic does not have to be separated from the religious. Mysticism does not exempt one from remaining within the bounds of the revelation of Christianity that was given us by God. Christianity is a revealed religion not a self determined spiritualism.\n \n \nThis is a portion the Catholic empire did not like:\n \n 2) Jesus said, \"Let him who seeks continue seeking until he finds. When he finds, he will become troubled. When he becomes troubled, he will be astonished, and he will rule over the All.\"\n \n 6) His disciples questioned Him and said to Him, \"Do you want us to fast? How shall we pray? Shall we give alms? What diet shall we observe?\" Jesus said, \"Do not tell lies, and do not do what you hate, for all things are plain in the sight of Heaven. For nothing hidden will not become manifest, and nothing covered will remain without being uncovered.\"\n\n \n I'm not sure how this threatens Catholicism.\n \n \nI truly believe when one \"lets go\" of all beliefs and builds from the ground up one can truly find thier path. It could very well be the Catholic church for some but I for one won't decide on a faith and tell others they are wrong...\n\n \n As I said earlier, Christianity was revealed to us. This means we have concrete historical information given to us by God...concrete truth. We can't let go of all of our beliefs and build up from oneself. \n \n \nG-d has been interpreted and reinterpreted over and over again by falable men?\n \n \n This is exactly what separates the Catholic Church from other churches. There has been one God and one Jesus preached by the Church. The Catholic Church has conveyed a consistent teaching on faith and morals for 2,000 years. You say that fallible men interpret and reinterpret but if you look at the teaching of the Church you will find consistency in truth. The Church is not the only path up the mountain. It is, however, the most appropriate path.",

Your anger and rage at your fellow man, your steadfastnest in a very simple one point argument logic that you simply won't abandon or elaborate on. If you are not here as a shepehered, are then you here as a wolf? \n \n Your anger betrays your faith. Your posts I do not see a Catholic believer confident and serene in the knowledge of G-d. I see a scared soul not sure of his path who hides behind the dogma of his selected religion. I do not know if you are trying to convince anyone of anything or are trying to convince yourself of your faith. Whatever the reason remember the path you chose is a journey. A journey in which you create the reality of the world and the reality I get a glimpse of from you is a very dark place.\n \n I strongly recommend you seek counseling with your priest. Show him the transcripts of this thread. Perhaps he can be of help.\n \n \n \n G-dspeed brother,\n \n \n Reverend Hellh0und\n\n \n \n HellHound;\n I am not angry at all and don't need to see anyone, my words might sound that way,that is your persopnal belief again.\n Its funny you do not answer my post directly but go around it by bring ing other topics that refer to me that I really am not talking about in my post.\n Answer this my friend, if the holy spirit is one truth, then which organization has that one full truth from the word of God, when Christ said he would reveal all truths to the church has time went on from the Spirit.\n Tell me where it states in scripture that the deciples recieved all truths from the holy spirit .\n \n You say everyone recieves truth when they believe in Christ by excepting Christ has their salvation, even the devil beliefs.\n So who is the truth revealed too, how can it be every believers with their self interpretations when they contradict from each other on the word has their organizations.\n Full truth my friend is revealed too one church whom Christ started that Christ himself said , he would be with her till the end of age will not leave has orphans.\n But many of you think that the true Catholic church fell after 313 AD, what story with no proof but lies.\n \n You and others like you reject many verses from scripture that show that the church is a one athority we must hear which I posted on a other post, but you turn from it has others who follow your example,creating more divsions everyday due too the tradition of private interpretation.\n Who was the church the people heard on matters of faith before they even had a bible in their hands in the 16 Century when the printing press came, they heard the Roman Catholic church except for Luther and Henry the 8th , but now everyone can get one and read it and think they speak the truth from the word, what a joke that is, even a young child can read and not understand what it states because of no guidance which you people follow has a young child [no athority but your self mademade roads that lead to many directions from the word not being one body and all, but many divisions who cannot agree.\n \n So you mean to tell me we been wrong for 2003 years and Protestantism is the source of truth , then which organization holds that truth on the word of God, you people do not like when I say that divisions are of Satan, but the bible states this , I see none of you saying anything against that verse, how nice to turn away or hear it.\n \n It seems to me you Christians who follow your own private beliefs with no athority but your own ,do not like the truth the way Protestantism is doing to God's word,causing divsions, private interpretation , symbolic and so on,these are the facts my friend what Protestantism is based on, self freewill of scripture with no guidance to keep watch over their soul has scripture plainly states the pillar of truth does.\n \n You all pick your own self beliefs on the word not hearing what Christ really states to his one true church who is Catholic on all truths not has Protestantism who have many to choose from.\n \n So don't think I am upset or anything like that due to the way I state things,I'AM NOT.\n \n I am happy emoticon_smile \n \n Peace ;Drac",

   "Please!! Elaborate. I don't understand how my different belief proves that God exists in a form contrary to my own truth..\n\n \n The fact that you must make a statement like God doesn't exist is an indication of an Absolute statement. You state that there are no absolutes yet you state an absolute. It is the need for absolutes that points to an absolute outside of ourselves. However, a debate for another thread.\n \n \nA small piece of bread is only a piece of bread. And wine is only wine. Yet Catholic practice asserts that through belief, this substance becomes the body and blood of Jesus. And all throughout Christian history, people have had amazing things happen based on belief. Miracles and such.\n \n Now, concentrating on the desk and imagining a candy bar may not cause one to appear, but I could very well see one in my own vision. A mirage, if you will. And if I were to be truly famished, I may possibly be able to \"touch\" this candy bar. Maybe even taste it. From your perception, it does not exist. But from mine, it is very real.\n \n Of course, the idea that all truth is a matter of everything is hard to grasp. In order to understand the idea that everything is truth, that everything is possible is quite, well, impossible. But I know (even though I can't exactly explain it with feeble language) that God is everything. God could not spontaneously appear from Nothing. So clearly, this God has always been. Matter could not appear from nowhere. In fact, matter is something that cannot be created or destroyed. It either changes form or becomes energy. So since God and matter have always existed.... hmm.... maybe this dual system is in fact the same. God is matter. God is all things. So, what is truth, when everything is comprised of God-niblets? Ah, my friend, truth is truth. God is God. Life is life. How can evil or good exist? Perception varies from person to person. If all people are parts of a whole (God), then how could one be right and one be wrong? The answer is simple: it's not that way. Everything is just what it is. Enjoy it.\n .\n\n \n In my line of work, when people start seeing and touching things that are not there but are there in their perception, we medicate them. Just because you experience something does not make it real. \n \n Go ahead and believe Gas into your tank if you like and see how far your car goes. You cannot stop and actually put gas in your tank. For you reality is whatever you believe. Therefore start living your life like you believe that. Quit buying food or paying for electricity or buying gas. Just believe it into existance. One of two things will happen. Some will file a petition to have you court ordered for psychiatric treatment or you will die from exposure.\n \n The problem with your theory is that you don't really BELIEVE it. You put no stock in it. You do not live your life that way where it counts. You count on doing things. You count on the red light to be red when it is red. You count on the grocery store to put food out to purchase. If you really belived what you say then act like it. However, my point is that it is a mental exercise for you. NIfty, but useless.",

   "Reverend Hellhound,\n \n \n \n You would have to give me some examples of which documents are hidden so I might respond as to why they have been hidden (but maybe that is impossible according to your assertion). If this is not possible then perhaps you can tell me what has led you to believe that the Church has archived thousands of documents to keep them from the eyes of the faithful.\n\n \n This is a whole nother thread and I do not want to continue down a negative road on the Catholic church as this is not my intent. Answer this though can anyone look throught the church document archives (relating to ancient texts) or is it restricted?\n \n \n \n What supposed agenda of the Church have you come up with? The agenda of the Catholic Church is to be a visible sign of Jesus Christ in the world. The agenda of the Catholic Church is to go out and make disciples of all nations as Jesus commanded. The agenda of the Church is to convey charity by feeding the hungry, caring for the sick, and helping for the poor. I too believe the pope is a fallible man. That is the teaching of the Church. He does, however, proclaim faith and morals infallibly as a result of the protection granted by Jesus Christ. Why do you believe that the Church hides insightful documents from the world? How did this conspiracy theory develop? Or have you been reading the DaVinci code?\n\n \n Again I believe this is another tread. There is plenty on the subject on that thar internet if you are so inclined. Yes I made the point and yes I understand I should back it up, however time is not on my side right now so I ask that we revisit this specifically later.\n \n The agenda in previous times was governmental control today it is maintaining its membership. \n \n \n \n Why would you think I believed that a Buddhist would be cast into fire for being born? This is not the teaching of the Catholic Church. You may be confusing Catholics with some Baptists who believe that unless one is a baptized Christian then he cannot be saved. Read the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) paragraph 842-847:\n \n 842 The Church's bond with non-Christian religions is in the first place the common origin and end of the human race: \n All nations form but one community. This is so because all stem from the one stock which God created to people the entire earth, and also because all share a common destiny, namely God. His providence, evident goodness, and saving designs extend to all against the day when the elect are gathered together in the holy city. . .\n \n 843 The Catholic Church recognizes in other religions that search, among shadows and images, for the God who is unknown yet near since he gives life and breath and all things and wants all men to be saved. Thus, the Church considers all goodness and truth found in these religions as \"a preparation for the Gospel and given by him who enlightens all men that they may at length have life.\"\n\n \n As a preparation for the Gospel? What if they hear it but decide it is not for them?\n \n \n\n 847 This affirmation is not aimed at those who, through no fault of their own, do not know Christ and his Church: \n Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or his Church, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and, moved by grace, try in their actions to do his will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too may achieve eternal salvation.\n \n\n \n I know this. And this is good. This contradicts though what Drac was/is saying. However What if it is through a \"fault of thier own\"? These people moved by grace but with a different belief system than you. What of these people?\n \n \n\n Does this sound like seclusion or inclusion? Catholics appreciate the brotherhood of all but we proclaim that the fullest unity of this brotherhood resides in the Catholic Church. What Church is more universal and inclusive than the Catholic Church? You can find it in any nation, language, culture, or race on earth. \n\n \n Perhaps you are thinking my talks with Drac are universal towards the Catholic church. This is not the case. The Catholic church you speak of here differs greatly from the drumbeats of Drac.\n \n \n \n\n Your scriptural exegesis is a huge stretch of what the original meaning of John's writing was. Who came up with this? The Gospel of John is an attempt to convey Christ's deity. Look further to John 1:14  and it will confirm that Jesus is the Word of which John speaks. \"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth; we have beheld his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father.\"\n\n \n \n And the Word became flesh. The Word was always there. 1st there was the word right? Word - sound - vibration. This is the essense of G-d. We are vibration. All things vibrate.. All things come from the Word(G-d). Was it to convey Jesus de christo's diety or our oneness with G-d? Have you read the literal translations? Very interesting indeed!\n \n \n \n\n I'm not sure what you mean when you say that these things mean nothing to the \"Universal.\" You are a Unitarian Universalist? This brings up more questions: Are you a Christian or simply a theist? Do you accept the Bible as the Word of God? What do you think of Jesus' claims to be God? Give me more detail on your position. How were you ordained as a minister and by whom?\n\n \n Universal, G-d, etc is all interchangable. I expounded on my background Somewhat in a previous post. I am an active ordained minister in the Universal Life Church. I accept the Bible as just one of the many words of G-d but no more than an easterly wind or a childs smile. I don't need a Bible or a church to know G-d. G-d speaks to me right where I stand! My prayer is in my movements and my actions! Of course Jesus was G-d but I beleive the message is that we are all G-d. Part of the same vibration or Word.\n \n \n \n\n Bread and wine would be more appropriate.\n \n\n \n Why is a graham cracker of the devil? Have not some churches gone from wine to grape juice?\n \n \n\n No, a corrupt man cannot take the Church off of its path because Jesus promised to the Church he established that the gates of hell would not prevail against it (Matthew 16:18). He said that the Counselor would guide the Church into all truth (John 16:13). The self cannot be the seeker of truth without guidance.\n\n \n Did he establish a Church? An organization? Who is the Counselor, the Pope? Have not popes in the past murdered and raped? Is this the path of righteousness?\n \n \n\n I can appreciate the Christian mystic. Catholicism has many. The mystic does not have to be separated from the religious. Mysticism does not exempt one from remaining within the bounds of the revelation of Christianity that was given us by God. Christianity is a revealed religion not a self determined spiritualism.\n\n \n Ah yes and as I said before I have a great respect for the Catholic Church and I believe the Pope is an enlightened man. However there are several tenants I can not subscribe to. These conclusions come from years of study and yes guidance. \n \n \n \n \n\n As I said earlier, Christianity was revealed to us. This means we have concrete historical information given to us by God...concrete truth. We can't let go of all of our beliefs and build up from oneself. \n\n \n Right action, Right thought is of G-d. G-d does not need to be revealed to us for us to be with G-d for it is already so! Your concrete historical information has been translated and rewritten thousands of times. Perhaps something changed along the way?\n \n I disagree. Let go of ALL your beliefs. Reflect within and begin study anew. WIth a clear mind the truth reveals itself and can be verified through diligent study. Only the self can make the realization not the religion handed to you by your parents!\n \n \n\n This is exactly what separates the Catholic Church from other churches. There has been one God and one Jesus preached by the Church. The Catholic Church has conveyed a consistent teaching on faith and morals for 2,000 years. You say that fallible men interpret and reinterpret but if you look at the teaching of the Church you will find consistency in truth. The Church is not the only path up the mountain. It is, however, the most appropriate path.\n\n \n \n You have a much more accepting spirit than our friend Drac. I for one can not say which path is the right one as I am only a man. however I can tell you I am a on a good one and am happy to share the Joy that I have.\n \n \n \n Reverend HellH0und",

   "HellHound;\n I am not angry at all and don't need to see anyone, my words might sound that way,that is your persopnal belief again.\n Its funny you do not answer my post directly but go around it by bring ing other topics that refer to me that I really am not talking about in my post.\n \n Answer this my friend, if the holy spirit is one truth, then which organization has that one full truth from the word of God, when Christ said he would reveal all truths to the church has time went on from the Spirit.\n \n \n\n \n The holy Spirit, The life essence, the Soul, are all one in the same.

You talk of one true church saying that no one else counts you are separating G-d are you not?\n \n \n \"Julian of Norwich, the medieval Christian mystic, said 'God is closer to you\n than your own soul', and spoke of the soul being 'oned' with God. In our\n Higher Selves we are all God, but this is the Self which is behind the ego\n and the conscious self: in the Judeo-Christian tradition it is the I AM,\n which was the name God gave when Moses heard him speaking from the burning\n bush, and is used by Jesus in St John's Gospel. An exoteric interpretation,\n which most Christians give it, says that Jesus is personally the one and\n only son of God, whereas the (correct!) esoteric interpretation is that he\n is a human being achieving Christ Consciousness and recognising his inner\n oneness with the Divine -- an example that the true Christian is supposed to\n try to follow.\"\n \n \n \n\n Tell me where it states in scripture that the deciples recieved all truths from the holy spirit. \n \n\n \n Following my previous paragraph if everything is everyone and each one is all then you can find it all throught.

I do not hold that position. Stop. listen. Clear your mind. That my friend is the truth. The chatter you hear is your brothers and sisters trying to explain the SAME truth in there own words. We have perceptions that change from individual to individual. WHat I tell you here is that same chatter. Perhaps by listening and not listening to the chatter and letting those barriers go we can all see the truth!\n \n \n\n You and others like you reject many verses from scripture that show that the church is a one athority we must hear which I posted on a other post, but you turn from it has others who follow your example,creating more divsions everyday due too the tradition of private interpretation.\n Who was the church the people heard on matters of faith before they even had a bible in their hands in the 16 Century when the printing press came, they heard the Roman Catholic church except for Luther and Henry the 8th , but now everyone can get one and read it and think they speak the truth from the word, what a joke that is, even a young child can read and not understand what it states because of no guidance which you people follow has a young child [no athority but your self mademade roads that lead to many directions from the word not being one body and all, but many divisions who cannot agree.\n \n\n \n Who did the cavemen listen to before G-d created the Earth? \n \n \n\n So you mean to tell me we been wrong for 2003 years and Protestantism is the source of truth , then which organization holds that truth on the word of God, you people do not like when I say that divisions are of Satan, but the bible states this , I see none of you saying anything against that verse, how nice to turn away or hear it.\n \n\n \n No. Protestants have no more hold on the truth than anyone else.

The catholic church has set itself above scripture and where scripture conflicts they choose to interpret scripture as allegory. This is poor hermaneutics and does not let scripture resolve the conflicts in scripture. This takes time, dependence on the Holy Spirit of God and a commitment to live in communion with Him. \n \n Do you have that committment? The easiest way to tell is to look at those in your life that you influence and ask, How are they doing?",

   "This does not change the fact that the Catholic Church remains unstained as the bride of Christ in her communication of the truth of Christ. The members of the Church, the pope included, are not impeccable. The pope's teaching on faith and morality is infallible though.\n\n \n Okay, let's imagine for a minute that in the church's conception, it was the actual word of god, the only word of god. Now let's take the church through the history of that Renaissance period.... when pope's murdered, committed heinous crimes of humanity.... sold indulgences (those awesome \"free Jesus\" coupons).... when documents were amended and altered to suit the needs of the papal throne.... Now, with all this mess going on, how can the Catholic Church remain the same??? How can it be unstained when it still bears those same mutations that were twisted unto it via fallible men?\n \n And in regards to the pope's infallible teachings.... can men not interpret things incorrectly? What makes the papacy god's throne on earth? Do you honestly believe that after all the corruption and powermongering of the popes throughout history that god honors these men with the absolute truth on morality??? Faith cannot be taught, though, nor can it be a god-given blessing. Faith is therefore removed from the argument, since there can be no authority on something so personal as the degree of personal belief one expresses.\n \n \nDid the Church cause this evil or did a lack of adherence to what the Church teaches cause this? There is evil out there that is sure. The Crusades were a response to Muslim aggression (not without its abuses though), the Israeli/Palestinian conflict is more a nationalistic struggle than a religious one, and the Holocaust was insanity not religion--it was not Christianity but the antithesis of it.\n\n \n First off, Christianity is not defined by kindness. Christianity is defined by the idea that Jesus was god's son on earth, and through believing in him, salvation is granted. So really, the only antithesis of such a belief would be, simply, non-belief, which is not necessarily a negative. My ideas would be an antithesis to Christianity, since I do not think Jesus or the belief in Jesus is integral to saving one's soul.\n \n Secondly, the pride of nationalism is basically the same as the pride one would have in religion. In both, the idea is identical: our way is the correct way, and if you are given the option and choose not to join us, you are in a worse position. Whether that worse position stated means non-believers are hell-bound, doomed to suffer in purgatory, or should not be allowed to live or roam free is irrelevant. The point is that once somone has a conditional statement which creates superiority, there is obviously a comparable \"lesser person\". Superiority is what makes the United States of America conquer lands and force natives to believe in democracy. This is bad. Choice is personal, and a different choice is not necessarily wrong. It is simply different. All things lie in the eye of the beholder.\n \n \n \nWhy would I practice a religion that I did not believe to be true? Why follow this religion if others are equally truthful?\n\n \n You practice your religion because it rings true to your spirit. Cool with me. If you can back it up, great. But truth is, in fact, relative, especially since this crazy word truth we're using is not actually truth at all. Truth must be proven, and since matters of spirituality and belief are unprovable, our truth really boils down to personal truth or opinion.\n \n \n\n Do you see my perspective? I'm not saying that others are totally devoid of truth. Most religions have elements of truth, most denominations of Christianity do. But there is only one that has the fullness of truth. Not because man professes it. Because Christ did.\n \n\n \n You've read that Christ professed it. Unless you can prove Jesus, you cannot assure your validity in stating the amount of truth present.\n \n The Bible was collected and rewritten by Romans. The Romans were a polytheistic bunch who wanted to unify their kingdom by using Christianity, which was widely spreading. However, Christianity had its divisions even before this. The church was, in fact, quite in turmoil and dischord. Only because the Roman Empire switched the official state religion did things clear up. Why? The emperors had dissonants executed. A lot of your saints fall into this category.\n \n Christmas is really not when Jesus was said to be born. December 25th was actually the day of pagan sun god worship, among other celebrations, that fell on the winter soltice. But to unify the kingdom, the sun god became the son of god. Slick, eh? Easter is really the vernal equinox, when plenty o' pagans did various spring worship festivals (Easter actually comes from Eostre, the Pagan holiday that celebrates the return of spring and the balance between light and dark through the worship of the goddess of dawn, fertility, and new beginnings.... sounds similar to the idea of the resurrection, eh?).\n \n The point is that Christianity is fine for some, and I can't hate on that. But to say that there is more truth in Catholicism than in any other denomination, let alone religion, is absurd. The Dali Lama is as much the \"truth\" as the \"pope\". But the Dali Lamas have never really done anything contrary to their asserted beliefs.\n \n \n\n There is good reason why Catholics believe that the Church is the truth. (Ephesians 3:10, 1 Timothy 3:15).\n \n\n \n Any Biblical quotes are truly open for interpretation, so please stop using them as evidence. I could just as easily use the Gospel of Thomas, but apparently, it's been proven wrong or something. Well, I've proven the Bible wrong, how's that?\n \n \n\n I disagree with you that the search for the kingdom is an inner thing because God revealed to us facts about himself. It is not simply an inner thing because it must involve interaction with others-the Body of Christ.\n\n \n This is the humorous part. You say that there is no inner search, yet, you actually practice it but don't realize it. You call it by a different name than I. The body of Christ is a spiritual matter, as far as I'm concerned, unless you've touched it lately in the physical sense. It's not essential, though, that you go through a \"middle-man\", you can just raise your own sense of spirituality.\n \n \nI'm not trying to cram anything down anybody. I'm not saying that it's the only truth, just the fullness of truth.\n\n \n So what you're saying is that it's not the only answer, but the only complete answer. Well, I know damn well that I can be just as \"holy\" or \"saved\" or \"spiritual\" as anyone else without Jesus or the books about him. I consider the Bible good insight, but it's no more complete than my own capacity to understand life.\n \n \n\n And what happens to murderers, rapists, pedophiles that are unrepentant in your view? Who does things against their own personal dogma? Priests who are pedophiles might be one example.\n\n \n People who do \"wrong\" don't always think they're wrong. It's just others forcing their judgment on a person. The world is not black and white. It's not a duality. It's just white; the inclusion of all colors. What if the Jews hadn't crucified Christ? Where would the religion be then? All things have their place in this world. You couldn't have what we perceive as good without what we perceive as bad. That merely gives us perspective on growth. It allows us to not stagnate, but to move forward. But just because hunger gives me a pain when I have no food doesn't mean hunger is an evil thing or that it's bad. Hunger simply let's me know I'm alive and that I should probably get some grub. If hunger were a person that gave people pains in their stomachs, he would not be damned for being bad.\n \n \nNo one taught me that matter is evil and spirit is good. It is a belief of the Gnostics. The Gnostics were responsible for the Gospel of Thomas which you so often embrace.\n\n \n I believe you misconstrue. The Gnostics never said that matter was evil, they simply realized it was a roadblock in the path to spirituality. Men have obsessions with material things, and when you're distracted like that, you can't really think about the important stuff. But I don't think I read about many whole-hearted Gnostics who swore off clothing, food, and water just to become beings of spirit. Again, so-called \"evils\" have their place. You hafta survive if you want to start your quest to understand the great Universe. Or else you die.\n \n \nHitler didn't see himself as evil but others certainly did. You do not believe in evil? Have you ever experienced hatred, bigotry, violence, discrimination personally? How do you characterize this in your perspective?\n\n \n Everyone has a reason for what they do. Hatred is not a happy thing for me. I don't like being beaten up, nor would I enjoy being discriminated against unfairly. But without these things, the world would be bland, quite frankly. I learn about life through living, not imagining what heaven's like. Besides, if you didn't dislike certain things, how would you know the joy of having something you did like?\n \n Honestly, in the end, I think every spirit will realize that everything is good. Watch American Beauty. It's a great testament to this idea. Even the bad, from a perspective, is good. Had Hitler not done the things he did, mankind would not know what it was truly capable of. The USA would be an isolationist nation still. Allowing lots of craziness to ensue around the globe. Perhaps the chaos Hitler created was necessary to bring about the next steps in our history. World War II was the best thing that ever happened for technology. Hitler made this computer chat possible, really. Space exploration? Hitler, Stalin. Yep. Bad things create good things. Only the Universe truly knows the grand scheme. If the Universe is even conscious..... (look up noetic energy and read His Dark Materials.... good stuff)\n \n \nYou ever go on a hike, say, into the Grand Canyon? Would you try it by yourself or would you use a guide who was familiar with it? We have guidelines set forth by the Church to protect us. This does not mean that we cannot think for ourselves. We cannot do everything by ourself. This does not mean that we lose ourself.\n\n \n Nice analogy. Does this guide tell you that you must follow a certain path because he has deemed it the correct way? What happens when you forsake his chosen path? Is his path the only complete path? Are there other paths that are just as efficient, if not, maybe better?\n \n Maybe I'll go without a guide so that my journey is not influenced by his interference.\n \n \nAre you saying that no one is wrong and then telling me I am wrong for following a church? You say that those who interpret for themselves are wiser? How can there be ANY wiser if no one is wrong?\n\n \n Wisdom is found in understanding that everything is right. When you choose one path and claim it's the only true and/or complete path, you're wrong. The truth is this (and by truth, I mean the real truth): Since each person can make up his or her own mind for his- or herself, and there are infinite persons in the Universe, the number of truths is infinite. That is wisdom. And by following a church (which is okay) and claiming it is the one complete truth (which is not okay) you are wrong. You are wrong for the arrogant claim, not for your belief in a church.\n \n The problem is this: the Catholic Church teaches that it is the only true church. So I almost want to say that by following the church, you are inherently wrong.\n \n And you are WISER for understanding that everything is right, by reinforcing individual perception and belief.\n \n \n\n Is your anger at your Catholic upbringing the reason you have problems with organized religion? What is wrong with guilt? It is a protective mechanism. It keeps us away from harmful things. There is nothing wrong with guilt.\n\n \n Guilt can be good and bad. I just don't think that I should feel guilty for \"original sin\", or for not believing that Jesus will save me. Guilt should not keep harm from you, but instead, knowledge should tell you what is harmful and knowledge should tell you to stay away. Guilt is why there's such low self-esteem in the USA these days.\n \n \n\n The Catholic Church does not teach that the bread and wine changing to the Lord's body and blood is dependent on belief. Your belief or my belief cannot change the reality of the transubstantiation of the Eucharist when it occurs.\n\n \n Transubstantiation is not physical. No chemicals change. Nothing about the bread and wine changes. It's still bread and wine. If I had an ultrasound to see what I consumed after partaking in the Eucharist, you would find some chewed up bread and some wine. So really, regardless of \"official\" teachings, it really is a belief.\n \n \n Holla.",

   "The fact that you must make a statement like God doesn't exist is an indication of an Absolute statement. You state that there are no absolutes yet you state an absolute. It is the need for absolutes that points to an absolute outside of ourselves. However, a debate for another thread.\n\n \n Reread what I've said, holmes. I think there's a god. I just think of God as more of a Universal wholeness than as a judge or whatnot. There are no absolutes, and that's what I've been saying. This \"one true church\" junk is BS. The one true church is whatever I say it is. Or you. Or Bob Villa. Or whomever is in question. All things are true because not one perception can be proven better than any other. It's all in the eye of the beholder, so why not just say that all things are right???\n \n \n\n In my line of work, when people start seeing and touching things that are not there but are there in their perception, we medicate them. Just because you experience something does not make it real.\n\n \n Then next time you say you hear god or Jesus or some semblance of a holy spirit in prayer, I'll call up the mental institute, since really, it's all the same. You can no more prove Jesus or \"god\" than I can prove that chakras exist. There's some inconclusive science behind it all, but really, it comes back to personal belief and interpretation.\n \n \n\n Go ahead and believe Gas into your tank if you like and see how far your car goes. You cannot stop and actually put gas in your tank. For you reality is whatever you believe. Therefore start living your life like you believe that. Quit buying food or paying for electricity or buying gas. Just believe it into existance. One of two things will happen. Some will file a petition to have you court ordered for psychiatric treatment or you will die from exposure.\n\n \n I'm not really talking about the physical world, genius (I doubt most of us here really are!). I'm talking about stuff you can't prove anyway. And besides, can you disprove anything I'm saying? Prove that someone isn't possessed by the Holy Spirit. Now, to really address your comment, I don't have a doubt in my mind that men have the capacity to perform miracles of sorts, like fill an empty gas tank with but a thought, or make white chocolate appear from thin air. But that takes belief and mechanics that, in this day and age, we haven't tapped into yet. Just remember, people laughed at Galileo when he said the earth was round.\n \n \n\n The problem with your theory is that you don't really BELIEVE it. You put no stock in it. You do not live your life that way where it counts. You count on doing things. You count on the red light to be red when it is red. You count on the grocery store to put food out to purchase. If you really belived what you say then act like it. However, my point is that it is a mental exercise for you. NIfty, but useless.\n\n \n Prove that I don't believe my theory. Any and everything is possible. I've seen qi masters heal cancer, burn paper with a projection of energy from bare hands, knock people down without touching them. I haven't the patience to learn to do this stuff, however, since I enjoy the life I have. I make music, which I consider a godly task in itself. I make joyous sounds from nothing. I create.\n \n Is creation good enough for you?\n \n And yes, I live in this world, and since I cannot fully manipulate it quite yet, I expect things like red lights and groceries to exist. But that doesn't prove that your belief in Jesus is any more real than my non-belief, or that one truth is more correct than another. Who knows? When we evolve as people more, we may soon realize that the power of god is in our own hands.\n \n We are all pieces of God and the Universe, and I try daily to remember this. That's when I perform at peak.\n \n Holla.",

   "Rev. Hellhound,\n \n \nAnswer this though can anyone look throught the church document archives (relating to ancient texts) or is it restricted?\n\n \n I hope not. I don't want some slob or careless vagrant getting peanut butter and jelly on those valued ancient texts.\n \n \nThe agenda in previous times was governmental control today it is maintaining its membership.\n \n \n That's what you propose as the agenda of the Church. That is not the agenda of the Church.\n \n \nPerhaps you are thinking my talks with Drac are universal towards the Catholic church. This is not the case. The Catholic church you speak of here differs greatly from the drumbeats of Drac.\n\n \n There is one Catholic Church. It is not the Church according to Maximus or the Church according to Drac. We are subservient to the teachings of the Church. \n \n \nAnd the Word became flesh. The Word was always there. 1st there was the word right? Word - sound - vibration. This is the essense of G-d. We are vibration. All things vibrate.. All things come from the Word(G-d). Was it to convey Jesus de christo's diety or our oneness with G-d? Have you read the literal translations? Very interesting indeed!\n\n \n It's a stretch. I do not know of the literal translations of which you speak. John was the most figurative of the gospel authors--are you trying to tell me you are going to literalize him? There is room for some of that but not to the degree of which you speak. \n \n Tell me, is it your belief that Jesus taught a pantheistic type of belief? Or is this your take looking back on history? I find it hard to believe that none of his apostles understood him the way you do. They walked and talked with him and did not have these notions. Is the Church the one who meddles with the faith or is it you? Was Jesus equal to you and me in his level of Godhood? The apostles didn't think so. What do you make of Paul's statement that the \"fullness of the deity\" dwelled in Christ? Does this fullness also dwell in us? Is there no superior God above humans? Are we all united into one God? Why did they call Jesus \"Lord and Savior?\"\n \n \nUniversal, G-d, etc is all interchangable. I expounded on my background Somewhat in a previous post. I am an active ordained minister in the Universal Life Church. I accept the Bible as just one of the many words of G-d but no more than an easterly wind or a childs smile. I don't need a Bible or a church to know G-d. G-d speaks to me right where I stand! My prayer is in my movements and my actions! Of course Jesus was G-d but I beleive the message is that we are all G-d. Part of the same vibration or Word.\n\n \n I don't understand why universalists go through the trouble of being ordained. If we are all God then why does one need to be ordained? If anyone can preach a sermon on anything at your church then why is a minister needed? \n \n Amen-- God can be seen in nature, in people. God speaks to us in many ways. But he also speaks to us through his written word and his Church. Amen--prayer is in movement and action. \n \n \nWhy is a graham cracker of the devil? Have not some churches gone from wine to grape juice?\n \n \n I never said a graham cracker is of the devil. It just wasn't an accurate description of the matter used in the sacrament.\n \n \nDid he establish a Church? An organization? Who is the Counselor, the Pope? Have not popes in the past murdered and raped? Is this the path of righteousness?\n\n \n Yes, Jesus did in fact establish a Church--a visible church on earth--a sacrament--a visible sign of invisible grace. (Matthew 16:18, Matthew 18: 17-18, Ephesians 3:10, 1 Timothy 3:15) \n \n No, the Pope is not the Counselor, the Holy Spirit is. The pope has been given the \"keys to the kingdom\" and the \"power to bind and loose\" though. He is the earthly guide of the Church and its source of unity through Christ. \n \n \nRight action, Right thought is of G-d. G-d does not need to be revealed to us for us to be with G-d for it is already so! Your concrete historical information has been translated and rewritten thousands of times. Perhaps something changed along the way?\n\n \n That is somewhat true. God is evident. But God chose to reveal things to us about himself. Did he have to? No. Did he choose to? Yes. He wanted to communicate with us on our level so he humbled himself in the form of Jesus as human and God. God has bound his Revelation, his Church, his sacraments, but he is not bound by them.\n \n Something did change along the way...but it was not the teaching of the Church (another \"agenda\" of the Church--to protect the Revelation of God undefiled and uncorrupted). It was the ideas that have come about outside of the Church like those that you propose that are evidence of change along the way.\n \n \nI disagree. Let go of ALL your beliefs. Reflect within and begin study anew. WIth a clear mind the truth reveals itself and can be verified through diligent study. Only the self can make the realization not the religion handed to you by your parents!\n\n \n Many \"truths\" have been realized by people throughout the ages. Not all of our realizations are truth.\n \n A few questions:\n 1)How universal is your universalism? Do you believe in the right to abortion? And what do you think of the God in that preborn individual?\n \n 2) How do you explain your unique, individual personality/personhood in the oneness of your universalism?",

   "Hellhound,\n \n RE: your statements regarding the pope saying that hell was a \"state of mind.\"\n \n He actually described it thus, \"More than a place, Hell is the state of those who freely and definitely separate themselves from God, the source of all life and joy.\"\n \n He said state but not state of mind. This can be explained by the fact that souls in hell do not have a body and so do not have location as we understand it. Hell may be a state of being although the Pope acknowledges that it will have a location after the resurrection of the body.\n \n Look to his other quotes on hell:\n \n In his 1994 book, Crossing the Threshold of Hope, Pope John Paul II wrote that too often \"preachers, catechists, teachers . . . no longer have the courage to preach the threat of hell\" (p. 183). \n \n Concerning the reality of hell, the pope says, \"In point of fact, the ancient councils rejected the theory . . . according to which the world would be regenerated after destruction, and every creature would be saved; a theory which abolished hell. . . . [T]he words of Christ are unequivocal. In Matthew's Gospel he speaks clearly of those who will go to eternal punishment (cf. Matt. 25:46). [But] who will these be? The Church has never made any pronouncement in this regard\" (pp. 185-6). \n (from www.catholic.com)\n \n The pope affirms the teaching of the Church: The Catechism of the Catholic Church states: \"The teaching of the Church affirms the existence of hell and its eternity. Immediately after death the souls of those who die in a state of mortal sin descend into hell, where they suffer the punishments of hell, 'eternal fire.' The chief punishment of hell is eternal separation from God, in whom alone man can possess the life and happiness for which he was created and for which he longs\" (CCC 1035). \n \n The Church says there is a real hell. It cannot and does not, however, say who has, or will be, going there.",

Have you been reading the DaVinci Code too?\n \n You are confusing the sin of man with the teaching of the Church founded by God. The Church's teaching on faith and morals has remained constant and unstained for 2,000 years.\n \n \nWhat makes the papacy god's throne on earth?\n \n \n Matthew 16:18  \n \n \n \nDo you honestly believe that after all the corruption and powermongering of the popes throughout history that god honors these men with the absolute truth on morality??? \n\n \n Yes, Peter was the prime apostle.

In both, the idea is identical: our way is the correct way, and if you are given the option and choose not to join us, you are in a worse position. Whether that worse position stated means non-believers are hell-bound, doomed to suffer in purgatory, or should not be allowed to live or roam free is irrelevant. The point is that once somone has a conditional statement which creates superiority, there is obviously a comparable \"lesser person\".\n \n \n I disagree. Christianity is not about superiority. Scripture tells us that no distinctions are to be made among us. It is not about \"ours is the correct way.\" It is more like, \"Come see this beauty and truth.\" There can be an optimistic view of Christianity you know. \n \n \nBut truth is, in fact, relative, especially since this crazy word truth we're using is not actually truth at all. Truth must be proven, and since matters of spirituality and belief are unprovable, our truth really boils down to personal truth or opinion.\n\n \n Truth and opinion are two different things. If truth is relative then I'm not sure that truth exists.\n \n \nThe Bible was collected and rewritten by Romans. The Romans were a polytheistic bunch who wanted to unify their kingdom by using Christianity, which was widely spreading. However, Christianity had its divisions even before this. The church was, in fact, quite in turmoil and dischord. Only because the Roman Empire switched the official state religion did things clear up. Why? The emperors had dissonants executed. A lot of your saints fall into this category.\n\n \n I'm not sure where you get this history. The Bible was not collected and rewritten by Romans.\n \n \nChristmas is really not when Jesus was said to be born. December 25th was actually the day of pagan sun god worship, among other celebrations, that fell on the winter soltice. But to unify the kingdom, the sun god became the son of god. Slick, eh? Easter is really the vernal equinox, when plenty o' pagans did various spring worship festivals (Easter actually comes from Eostre, the Pagan holiday that celebrates the return of spring and the balance between light and dark through the worship of the goddess of dawn, fertility, and new beginnings.... sounds similar to the idea of the resurrection, eh?).\n\n \n Please see the thread \"Is x-mas a pagan holiday\" where we discuss this.\n \n \nThe point is that Christianity is fine for some, and I can't hate on that. But to say that there is more truth in Catholicism than in any other denomination, let alone religion, is absurd. The Dali Lama is as much the \"truth\" as the \"pope\".\n \n \n So you wouldn't have any trouble believing in reincarnation?\n \n \nBut the Dali Lamas have never really done anything contrary to their asserted beliefs.\n\n \n And you know this how?\n \n \nThis is the humorous part. You say that there is no inner search, yet, you actually practice it but don't realize it.\n \n \n I never said there is no inner search. I asserted that it must be coupled with the Revelation God has made to us on earth.\n \n \n \nWisdom is found in understanding that everything is right. When you choose one path and claim it's the only true and/or complete path, you're wrong... And by following a church (which is okay) and claiming it is the one complete truth (which is not okay) you are wrong. You are wrong for the arrogant claim, not for your belief in a church.\n\n \n Again, everything is right but I am wrong? It doesn't seem that everything is right. You can take a stand and tell me that I am wrong for proclaiming what I proclaim but I cannot say that you are wrong for espousing your beliefs? The number of truths must not be infinite. Is wisdom knowing there are infinite truths or discerning truth from falsehood? Is it believing in everything or finding the most credible belief? My claim is not one of arrogance. It is one of trust, of faith, of logic, of history, of love.\n \n \n \nGuilt can be good and bad. I just don't think that I should feel guilty for \"original sin\", or for not believing that Jesus will save me. Guilt should not keep harm from you, but instead, knowledge should tell you what is harmful and knowledge should tell you to stay away. Guilt is why there's such low self-esteem in the USA these days.\n\n \n I do not live with a lot of guilt. I trust in the Lord. I know this sounds mushy to you. Guilt is only a guide. It is not constant or eternal. It can be extinguished with confession.\n \n \nTransubstantiation is not physical. No chemicals change. Nothing about the bread and wine changes. It's still bread and wine. If I had an ultrasound to see what I consumed after partaking in the Eucharist, you would find some chewed up bread and some wine. So really, regardless of \"official\" teachings, it really is a belief.\n\n \n The form doesn't change but the substance does--transubstantiation. That is, bread and wine still appear but the substance is the Body and Blood of Jesus.\n \n Peace.",

   "Reread what I've said, holmes. I think there's a god. I just think of God as more of a Universal wholeness than as a judge or whatnot. There are no absolutes, and that's what I've been saying. This \"one true church\" junk is BS. The one true church is whatever I say it is. Or you. Or Bob Villa. Or whomever is in question. All things are true because not one perception can be proven better than any other. It's all in the eye of the beholder, so why not just say that all things are right???\n \n \n \n Then next time you say you hear god or Jesus or some semblance of a holy spirit in prayer, I'll call up the mental institute, since really, it's all the same. You can no more prove Jesus or \"god\" than I can prove that chakras exist. There's some inconclusive science behind it all, but really, it comes back to personal belief and interpretation.\n \n \n \n I'm not really talking about the physical world, genius (I doubt most of us here really are!). I'm talking about stuff you can't prove anyway. And besides, can you disprove anything I'm saying? Prove that someone isn't possessed by the Holy Spirit. Now, to really address your comment, I don't have a doubt in my mind that men have the capacity to perform miracles of sorts, like fill an empty gas tank with but a thought, or make white chocolate appear from thin air. But that takes belief and mechanics that, in this day and age, we haven't tapped into yet. Just remember, people laughed at Galileo when he said the earth was round.\n \n \n \n Prove that I don't believe my theory. Any and everything is possible. I've seen qi masters heal cancer, burn paper with a projection of energy from bare hands, knock people down without touching them. I haven't the patience to learn to do this stuff, however, since I enjoy the life I have. I make music, which I consider a godly task in itself. I make joyous sounds from nothing. I create.\n \n Is creation good enough for you?\n \n And yes, I live in this world, and since I cannot fully manipulate it quite yet, I expect things like red lights and groceries to exist. But that doesn't prove that your belief in Jesus is any more real than my non-belief, or that one truth is more correct than another. Who knows? When we evolve as people more, we may soon realize that the power of god is in our own hands.\n \n We are all pieces of God and the Universe, and I try daily to remember this. That's when I perform at peak.\n \n Holla.\n\n \n Actually the point that I was trying to make, albeit not so well done, was that there is an objective reality to what is. It is not based on what you believe it simply is. I don't have to prove it and am not sure that I could if I wanted to. You can believe something different if you want to. I simply point out that does not make it objectively real. You say it does. My Gas tank analogy was to prove that it does not make it real. No one has ever done this. The things you say you have seen I believe are bunk. James Randi (who also doesn't believe in God by the way) has a challenge that anyone who can perform supernatural things under scientific observation at better than random chance levels he will pay one million dollars. Where are the mystics to claim this prize. He has had this challenge for more than a decade and no one has claimed the prize. one million bucks. \n \n God however, is not a djinn to be controlled by man. \n \n Just because I believe in God does not make him exist. He exists. period. If I choose to believe ohterwise then I believe that which is not real and try to drive on an empty tank. \n \n Now if you want to continue to throw ad hominem arguments and use phrases like \"genius\" etc. go ahead but they weaken you position. I do not desire an insult fest, just to make a point. If you are unwilling to argue the point with logic and not insults then just stop.",

   "Rev. Hellhound,\n \n I hope not. I don't want some slob or careless vagrant getting peanut butter and jelly on those valued ancient texts.\n \n\n \n Thats not what I mean. I for example as an ordained minister can not look upon ancient texts.\n \n \n\n There is one Catholic Church. It is not the Church according to Maximus or the Church according to Drac. We are subservient to the teachings of the Church.\n\n \n Of course there is only one Catholic church however there is you and there is drac. If I told you and drac to 'get me a sandwich' I would bet you would both bring me something unique! Perception of this Catholic truth you speak of is different in each individual. \n \n \n \n \n It's a stretch. I do not know of the literal translations of which you speak. John was the most figurative of the gospel authors--are you trying to tell me you are going to literalize him? There is room for some of that but not to the degree of which you speak. \n\n \n NO not literalize. The word is simply vibration that is all. We all vibrate all existance vibrates. its a unique concept I will be the first to admit it.\n \n \n\n Tell me, is it your belief that Jesus taught a pantheistic type of belief? Or is this your take looking back on history? I find it hard to believe that none of his apostles understood him the way you do. They walked and talked with him and did not have these notions. Is the Church the one who meddles with the faith or is it you? Was Jesus equal to you and me in his level of Godhood? The apostles didn't think so. What do you make of Paul's statement that the \"fullness of the deity\" dwelled in Christ? Does this fullness also dwell in us? Is there no superior God above humans? Are we all united into one God? Why did they call Jesus \"Lord and Savior?\"\n \n\n \n \n \"fullness of the deity\" dwelled in Christ is liken to the enlightenment in eastern religions. These are all good questions some I do not have answers for. \n \n \n\n I don't understand why universalists go through the trouble of being ordained. If we are all God then why does one need to be ordained? If anyone can preach a sermon on anything at your church then why is a minister needed? \n \n\n \n For legal purposes. I perform marriges, I serve at funerals, prison ministies, Hospice work etc.. I chose this path. That is all. A personal calling to be involved with the the spirituality of man without judgement. simple as that. (plus I get good parking at hospitals)\n \n \n\n Amen-- God can be seen in nature, in people. God speaks to us in many ways. But he also speaks to us through his written word and his Church. Amen--prayer is in movement and action. \n\n \n He speaks to us in many words. Not just your parental handed down knowledge. \n \n \n\n I never said a graham cracker is of the devil. It just wasn't an accurate description of the matter used in the sacrament.\n\n \n yeah I know I was being light hearted. \n \n \n \n\n No, the Pope is not the Counselor, the Holy Spirit is. The pope has been given the \"keys to the kingdom\" and the \"power to bind and loose\" though. He is the earthly guide of the Church and its source of unity through Christ. \n\n \n This Holy spirit. Where is it?\n \n \n \n\n That is somewhat true. God is evident. But God chose to reveal things to us about himself. Did he have to? No. Did he choose to? Yes. He wanted to communicate with us on our level so he humbled himself in the form of Jesus as human and God. God has bound his Revelation, his Church, his sacraments, but he is not bound by them.\n\n \n I don't think G-d chooses anything. G-d is, was, will be. The first and the last. If he is how can he \"choose\" why would he \"choose\" why would something so omnipotent take on these human things such as concepts of time and choosing. Why would something so omnipotent choose to make a soap opera out of his creation. I believe Jesus de Christo found this message and tried to convey it. Like in the Gospel of Thomas. The kingdom of Heaven is within you!\n \n \n\n Something did change along the way...but it was not the teaching of the Church (another \"agenda\" of the Church--to protect the Revelation of God undefiled and uncorrupted). It was the ideas that have come about outside of the Church like those that you propose that are evidence of change along the way.\n\n \n \n Do not get me wrong I respect you and your beliefs but I can not believe that the Catholic church has not at times modified doctrine in translation to other languages for its own empire asparations. Do you read latin?\n \n \n \n\n Many \"truths\" have been realized by people throughout the ages. Not all of our realizations are truth.\n \n A few questions:\n 1)How universal is your universalism? Do you believe in the right to abortion? And what do you think of the God in that preborn individual?\n \n 2) How do you explain your unique, individual personality/personhood in the oneness of your universalism?\n\n \n \n I agree. But the simple fact that there are so many truths argues the point itself that the likleyhood that one human run organization holds the monopoly on peoples souls is nill.\n \n 1. I believe that life is an expression of G-d. I believe that at the moment of conception this separation of spirit begins. Separation to the individual not a seperation from G-d so I believe abortion is wrong. I also believe that because religions define G-d the arrogance of the scientific community and the liberal abortion on demand crowd can ignore common sense logic that at a certain point EVEN TO them the life is a life beyond all argument. Do I think they are murderers? not neccesarrily. Ignorance or refusal to see for this or that reason to me means they need help. I however would not make it illeagal (mind you third trimester and partial birth abortions are a whole different story as you have to ignore common logic to believe anything other than killing a viable human being). I also abhor the abortion on demand crowd that insists that my tax dollars fund ONE abortion. (another reason I became a minister... Tax purposes, less money for the sow). Do I think a spirit or a soul is aborted or lost? no... because we are all one and the one is all. \n \n \n 2. Look at your hand. Your hand contains 5 individual fingers yet they are one hand. Have you ever played sports, ski, snowboarded? Ever have that feeling that you are 'in the zone'. Have you ever seen such a thing as this? How is it that some of these people seem to be able to know what is going to happen seemingly right before it does? Have you ever went to answer the phone seemingly a fraction of time before it rings? Ever get deja vu? What are these things. Granted they could be nothing but they could also be a little bit of something.\n \n \n Once again I have respect for all religions and churches. I think they are all yearning for the same thing and therefore on a good path to the top of the mountain. Now my beliefs are far from mainstream but my motives and my desires are the same as yours, even if the icons and the methodology or the wording is different. This very conversation we are having to me is a prayer. Questioning the questions, questioning the leaders, the answers and each other is a celebration of the human spirit and how possibly can this be against G-d?\n \n \n Reverend Hellh0und",

   "The Church never sold indulgences or sanctioned the sell of them.\n\n \n Just because the church never sold them as a body, the big guy that held the \"keys to the kingdom\" certainly made a few bones from them.\n \n \n\n How do you know that documents were amended or altered? Have you been reading the DaVinci Code too?\n\n \n Even if they weren't maliciously altered (which I'm sure happened, too), through translation from Latin to Greek to Hebrew to Aramaic to French to English to whatever else, words and meanings change. There are words in Latin that have no equivalent in English.... so what does one do when translating it? They have to substitute a word that may not quite mean the same thing. And besides, since a lot of the Bible is a symbolic work that deals with the intangible, translators probably cut even more corners. The Bible you read today is not the Bible that was read 2000 years ago.\n \n \n \nYou are confusing the sin of man with the teaching of the Church founded by God. The Church's teaching on faith and morals has remained constant and unstained for 2,000 years.\n\n \n Perhaps, I am, but nonetheless, no man on this planet has perfect ideals, no matter the subject.... faith, morals, or whatever else.\n \n \n \nMatthew 16:18 \n\n \n I'm so disappointed..... you must realize that a quote from days past doesn't count as evidence. Unless there were witnesses that can attest to the facts (and they're all dead... so there are none), no more use of the Bible as supposed proof. I might as well quote Stephen King and say that the Tommyknockers exist.\n \n \nYes, Peter was the prime apostle. He failed thrice. God accepted him in spite of this.\n\n \n I'm not talking about acceptance. God must be really gullible if he blindly grants supreme authority to a single position and expects that they'll be totally fair, honest, and unselfish... let alone moral and faithful. I mean, since we're giving god all sorts of human traits, I can call him gullible, right?\n \n \nYou are misunderstanding me a bit. When I speak of Faith in regard to the teaching of the Church, I mean the Faith that has been handed down--the Revelation of God. I do not mean one's personal consent to those revelations.\n\n \n Words must be interpreted. It is a primitive means of communication. Men are fallible. Therefore, even the pope can make errors. Even if god granted him supreme perfection in declaring his faith and morals, the pope can still mess up. And that means that it's not perfect. Therefore, this interpretation of words will differ from pope to pope, from pope to man, from man to man. Personal interpretation is what it's all about, not the written law.\n \n \nIt isn't? The second most important commandment Jesus gave in scripture was \"You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\" He also said that there is no greater love than a man give his life for that of another. Belief is required but so is kindness.\n\n \n In order to be Christian, you must believe in Jesus and basically declare to him your allegiance. If I'm a good man, spiritual, and wise-yet, I reject Jesus-I am not Christian. I believe I am a good person.... I believe I have much wisdom for the few years I've been around. And yet, I'm not a Christian. So clearly, goodness is not the main tenant of the religion, but rather allegiance to Jesus.\n \n \nI disagree. Christianity is not about superiority. Scripture tells us that no distinctions are to be made among us. It is not about \"ours is the correct way.\" It is more like, \"Come see this beauty and truth.\" There can be an optimistic view of Christianity you know.\n\n \n Don't get me wrong, I really don't mind Christians. My best friend is a Christian. But another friend of mine, also a Jesus-follower, always makes sure I know that I'm not a good boy unless I go to church and believe what he does. It's not necessarily a matter of superiority; we were pretty good friends all throughout high school. But nonetheless, his religion taught him that those who reject Christ as their savior will not be as favored as the good lil Catholics. This is really what I dislike and think is wrong. Such passive aggressive superiority is what makes me want to punch Jahovah's Witnesses in the face (not really, but you know....).\n \n \nTruth and opinion are two different things. If truth is relative then I'm not sure that truth exists.\n\n \n Bingo! There is only one truth..... everything. Can anyone argue that life does not exist? Can anyone argue that they don't believe in things? Can anyone argue any of this existence.... is existant? No. Therefore, it is the only truth. I think, therefore I am. That is the truth.\n \n I'll take it one step further. Everything is made from the same stuff: matter/energy. So we can prove that everything comes from an identical source. I call this source God or the Universe. To steal a concept from Rev. HellH0und: One hand, many digits.\n \n \nI'm not sure where you get this history. The Bible was not collected and rewritten by Romans.\n\n \n You think it was written and collected randomly by a bunch of bickering Christians? No one could agree on anything, especially a unified book on Christianity. The only reason it became organized was because folks like Athanasius bishop of Alexandria under Constantine compiled what others had written, resulting in the Bible you read today. Remember that your church is the Holy Roman Catholic Church.\n \n \nSo you wouldn't have any trouble believing in reincarnation?\n\n \n Not a single bit. Why, should I?\n \n \nAnd you know this how?\n\n \n Granted, I've no means to verify this, but have you or has anyone else heard of an Asian spiritualist who has totally violated his own vows? I just think of them as more advanced spiritually than we feeble Westerners.\n \n \nI never said there is no inner search. I asserted that it must be coupled with the Revelation God has made to us on earth.\n\n \n Unless god tells me specifically in plain English to read the Bible and believe in Jesus, I think my inner search will suffice for me.\n \n \nAgain, everything is right but I am wrong? It doesn't seem that everything is right. You can take a stand and tell me that I am wrong for proclaiming what I proclaim but I cannot say that you are wrong for espousing your beliefs? The number of truths must not be infinite. Is wisdom knowing there are infinite truths or discerning truth from falsehood? Is it believing in everything or finding the most credible belief? My claim is not one of arrogance. It is one of trust, of faith, of logic, of history, of love.\n\n \n You are not wrong for your beliefs, but if you affirm that Catholics are the only ones who are correct/complete about spirituality, you yourselves are wrong. It's the outward expression and declaration that makes your statement inccorect to me. You can think about shooting someone all day, but until you pull the trigger, it's not a crime. In the same sense, until you outwardly express that your church is the only true church, you are correct as you desire. I commend you for your spirituality, but once it judges my spirituality (even in a passive way), you have crossed the line.\n \n You probably feel I am doing the same. But I assert that I am merely defending those who wish not to be thought down upon. Non-Catholics don't want your pity, prayers, or any of that. Everyone would get along just fine if spirituality was just inward and not so much a declaration of power or identity. That's when people get superiority complexes and whatnot.... you know.... back to that argument.....\n \n \nI do not live with a lot of guilt. I trust in the Lord. I know this sounds mushy to you. Guilt is only a guide. It is not constant or eternal. It can be extinguished with confession.\n\n \n I just don't see a point in making someone feel guilty for just being themselves. Gays have a tough enough time without a church body casting aspersions upon them. I say be proud! Do what you must. Just be balanced.\n \n But hey, to each his own.\n \n \nThe form doesn't change but the substance does--transubstantiation. That is, bread and wine still appear but the substance is the Body and Blood of Jesus.\n\n \n Yep, sounds like belief. Unless you can prove it, it's a belief or opinion.\n \n Again.... be whatever religion you want to be. But don't tell anyone that they're doing wrong unless they want your say. That's my problem with Catholic dogma.... it just seems like most people can't separate it all.....\n \n Holla",

He exists. period.\n\n \n I don't doubt that a Universal Energy exists.... but as far as a god who gets mad and floods the globe.... I'd hafta see some evidence on that, please. AND NO USING BIBLE QUOTES.\n \n \nNow if you want to continue to throw ad hominem arguments and use phrases like \"genius\" etc. go ahead but they weaken you position.

If you are unwilling to argue the point with logic and not insults then just stop.\n\n \n My bad, dude.... my perception was that I was getting attitude.... so I threw it back at ya....\n \n No hard feelings.... but you must understand that I'm just as correct as you are.

   "\n Perception of truth does not alter the truth that exists\n \n\n \n Truth is in the eye of the beholder. Now someone relaying the truth to you has baggage, The person they heard it from, and so on all have baggage and perceptions so over time something so subjective that relies on faith alone how can one, two, three men tell you what is true? It is in your heart what is true and it is there for your taking.\n \n \n \n\n You mean to tell me that universalists go through stale, superstitious, rituals like funerals and marriages? :)\n\n \n I am here for my brothers and sisters. That is all. \n \n \n \n \n\n The Holy Spirit is not an \"it.\" The Holy Spirit is a person.\n\n \n That lives in all of us, and IS us. Everything is everyone and everyone is all!\n \n \n 1 Corinthians 3\n \n 16Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit lives in you? \n \n Ephesians 4\n 30And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. \n \n 1 Corinthians 12\n 13For we were all baptized by[1] one Spirit into one body--whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free--and we were all given the one Spirit to drink. \n \n \n 2 Corinthians 5\n 5Now it is God who has made us for this very purpose and has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n God is also a person, not a force. Why does he make a soap opera? Does he or do we? Why? The gift of free will. Why would he take on human things? Love...a closer relationship to us.\n\n \n To call G-d a person is to label him. To label him is to restrict him. To restrict him is to deny the truth(reality).\n \n \n \n\n Can you give me an example of when the Church has done this?\n\n \n Killcozzy has touched upon this well. \n \n \n \n\n You would make a good Catholic with that abortion stance (except maybe for the legality part). But I don't think you make a very good universalist as, I believe, that they traditionally fight for abortion rights-but I know, no labels can be placed on universalists.\n\n \n Thank you very much. I am never about making a good anything besides a person. The legality part is from my Libertarian roots. I do not beleive it is the States job to dictate what an individual can and can not do if they are not harming anyone else. I have a hard line where this is in regarding where I believe a poor choice becomes a crime (when the life can live outside the body) before that it is a most disheartening choice\n . \n \n \n\n Why did you leave your Protestant upbringing?\n\n \n \n \n Ah this is a very good question. I fully left the Dutch reform church in 91 during the Gulf War. I was a FAC in the USAF attached to an Army SF unit. I was involved in a firefight in which we took casualties. I saw first hand mans blinding indifference to his fellow man. I asked myself over and over again how can these people on both sides of the fight claim to be men of G-d when they can so easily throw lead at each other. I kept a small bible with me and read and read it all during my \"down time\". I wrote my minister weekly, He wrote back often but his words seemed somewhat hollow in the reality I was living in. Our next encounter got us entrapped to far foward with no means of support. Food and water was in short supply. We could not be extracted do to terain and an extraction would give away other friendly positions. We were there for 20 days. I ate nothing. I could not eat, I had no desire to eat. When we finally made it back I still could not eat. We redeployed again I still had not eaten anything. We were \"painting\" targets for bombers when we got word that our extraction was diverted and we would have to \"hump\" it back. We fought are way back stopping sometimes for days waiting for troop movements to finish. During this time I don't know if I was becoming delerious from not eathing or what. But I had this revelation that I can not put into words. At that moment we were ambushed by a republican guard detachment. I talked of this before in this thread but here it is again. We fought back hard. We took a few hits and they took a whole lot more. Thats when I saw the face of the enemy I looked into his face and I saw the very face of G-d. I smiled. I pulled the trigger. A wave of pure joy in my revelation (not at killing mind you) that this is the worse man can do to his fellow man and yet everything was going to be all right. Everything IS all right. I took that bible out of my pocket and laid it on the sand. I continued the fight. Afterwords when we got back to camp I was famished! I was hungry! I ate! I was ordered to see the doctor due to my massive weight loss. While I was resting the Chaplain came to see me. He was told by people in my unit that I had laid my Bible on the sand in the middle of an intense firefight and he thought I was having a crisis of concious or faith. He asked me if I still believed in G-d. I smiled and said yes. He then asked me why I laid the Bible down. I told him I no longer needed it to be with G-d. He smiled.\n \n \n \n I later found out by one of my buddies that I had not eaten for literally 40days. Strange huh?\n \n \n \n Reverend HellH0und",

   "Killa,\n \n \nJust because the church never sold them as a body, the big guy that held the \"keys to the kingdom\" certainly made a few bones from them.\n\n \n Again, I must ask for something to back your claim or at least a source for it. You have not been forthcoming with any. Your perception of things is not truth.\n \n \nEven if they weren't maliciously altered (which I'm sure happened, too), through translation from Latin to Greek to Hebrew to Aramaic to French to English to whatever else, words and meanings change. There are words in Latin that have no equivalent in English.... so what does one do when translating it? They have to substitute a word that may not quite mean the same thing. And besides, since a lot of the Bible is a symbolic work that deals with the intangible, translators probably cut even more corners. The Bible you read today is not the Bible that was read 2000 years ago.\n\n \n Actually there are biblical scholars that can and do read (parts of) the bible in the original languages as it was then. Don't you see that this is part of the Church's function--to protect the Word of God from corruption? The Church has protected the teachings for 2000 years. \n \n \nI'm so disappointed..... you must realize that a quote from days past doesn't count as evidence. Unless there were witnesses that can attest to the facts (and they're all dead... so there are none), no more use of the Bible as supposed proof. I might as well quote Stephen King and say that the Tommyknockers exist.\n\n \n Would you not expect a Christian belief to be supported by Christian documents? It seems that you are doing no better in providing historical evidence for your claims, leaving me a bit disappointed.\n \n But let me expound. The Bible is a very legitimate and sound historical source of information when compared to other writings of the time--other writings taken without a second thought by academics and lay people as yourself as sound historical information (Check out a book called The Historical Reliability of the Gospels--Craig Bloomberg or for an easier read The Case for Christ  by Lee Strobel (a former atheist)). Furthermore, I can provide several eyewitnesses and their writings that are not in the Bible--the Church Fathers wrote about Peter's role as the pope. I cited some of those earlier in the thread. \n \n A quote from days past does not count as evidence? It depends on who is the source of the quote and how historically reliable the recording of the quote was. Would you use the same blanket statement that a quote from the past doesn't count as evidence when speaking of Abraham Lincoln, Hitler, George Bush, or any number of other historical figures? Dead sources can be credible sources.\n \n Lastly, I provide biblical references because you were once a Christian were you not? I think you even said you were once Catholic. I provide these references because perhaps you never heard about them before. Are you sure you had an accurate picture of Christianity/Catholicism before you left it? Who or what has poisoned your mind against it? Did you study your faith before you left it or did you leave something that you did not fully know about?\n \n \nI'm not talking about acceptance. God must be really gullible if he blindly grants supreme authority to a single position and expects that they'll be totally fair, honest, and unselfish... let alone moral and faithful. I mean, since we're giving god all sorts of human traits, I can call him gullible, right?\n\n \n I'm not simply talking about acceptance either. God granted authority-he gave Peter the \"power to bind and loose\" and the \"keys to the kingdom\" that's what Matthew 16:18  is about. But God does not blindly grant supreme authority. God knowingly granted supreme authority. Jesus prayed that Peter's faith would not fail. (Luke 22:32) and that it would strengthen his brethren. If God gave this authority to Peter then it is likely that he would also give him the grace needed to fulfill his role.\n \n \nGod must be really gullible if he blindly grants supreme authority to a single position and expects that they'll be totally fair, honest, and unselfish... let alone moral and faithful. \n \n \n Again you are confusing impeccability with infallibility. The person of the pope is not impeccable-meaning he is not without sin. The current pope actually goes to confession daily and we have already discussed historical popes. But the charism of infallibility is exercised by the pope when he speaks ex cathedra  from the Chair of Peter--the charism granted by God the protects him from error. \n \n \nWords must be interpreted. It is a primitive means of communication. Men are fallible. Therefore, even the pope can make errors. Even if god granted him supreme perfection in declaring his faith and morals, the pope can still mess up. And that means that it's not perfect. Therefore, this interpretation of words will differ from pope to pope, from pope to man, from man to man. Personal interpretation is what it's all about, not the written law.\n\n \n You are contradicting yourself. If god granted supreme perfection in declaring THE  faith (not his faith) then the pope cannot mess it up. Furthermore, the Church is the only entity that has protected against personal interpretation. The pope cannot give his personal interpretation of the faith. He must give the interpretation that is consistent with the previous 2000 years of Christianity including the Christianity of Jesus himself and the eyewitnesses to Jesus. Scripture is not a matter of personal interpretation (2 Peter 1:20)\n \n \nIn order to be Christian, you must believe in Jesus and basically declare to him your allegiance. If I'm a good man, spiritual, and wise-yet, I reject Jesus-I am not Christian. I believe I am a good person.... I believe I have much wisdom for the few years I've been around. And yet, I'm not a Christian. So clearly, goodness is not the main tenant of the religion, but rather allegiance to Jesus.\n\n \n The two are inseperable-goodness and allegiance to Jesus. \n \n In Matthew 25:31-46  Jesus tells us of the conditions of getting into the Kingdom--clothe the naked, feed the poor, visit the imprisoned--as you did it to the least of these you did it to me\n \n Jesus told us that we had to be so kind we had to love others as ourself and even to love our enemies.\n \n Galatians 5:4-6, \"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any avail, but faith working through love.\"\n \n You can be a good person without being a Christian.\n \n \nBingo! There is only one truth..... everything. Can anyone argue that life does not exist? Can anyone argue that they don't believe in things? Can anyone argue any of this existence.... is existant? No. Therefore, it is the only truth. I think, therefore I am. That is the truth.\n\n \n One of the great philosphers actually did argue that this was only a dream, not true existence or something to that effect. I think I am a grapefruit therefore am I?\n \n \nI'll take it one step further. Everything is made from the same stuff: matter/energy. So we can prove that everything comes from an identical source. I call this source God or the Universe. To steal a concept from Rev. HellH0und: One hand, many digits\n.\n \n This stuff has differentiated or been differentiated quite a bit. None of the other stuff has the capabilities of the human stuff. Each human is unique.\n \n \nYou think it was written and collected randomly by a bunch of bickering Christians? No one could agree on anything, especially a unified book on Christianity. The only reason it became organized was because folks like Athanasius bishop of Alexandria under Constantine compiled what others had written, resulting in the Bible you read today. Remember that your church is the Holy Roman Catholic Church.\n\n No it was not written and collected randomly by a bunch of bickering Christians. It was written and collected orderly by a group of Catholic Christians who were united with one accord. The Bible is not what it is today because of one man, Athanasius. Athanasius made a list of scriptures that is close to what our Bible is today but not exactly like it. The Bible is the way it is because Councils of the Church defined it that way-look up the Council of Carthage, the Council of Hippo, the Coucil of Rome.\n \n And yes, my Church is the Holy Roman Catholic Church but not because it had only holy Romans in it. But because this is the location of the principal Church in its history. This is actually a name that was applied to the Church from the outside.\n \n \nGranted, I've no means to verify this, but have you or has anyone else heard of an Asian spiritualist who has totally violated his own vows? I just think of them as more advanced spiritually than we feeble Westerners.\n\n \n I think I have heard of some types of monks in the news for doing bad things. I don't remember crime, locale or religious affiliation though. \n \n \nUnless god tells me specifically in plain English to read the Bible and believe in Jesus, I think my inner search will suffice for me.\n\n \n And what if God is telling you in his Bible or in his Church what to do? \n \n Holla Amen.",

Non-Christian scholars. The \"adversaries\" of your Christian Bible scholars who strive to prove the good book true, 'they' strive to show it's a fable and not fact.\n \n \nI know this. I'm underpinning the point you're not making an argument. Your conclusion is that because some people doubt the authorship of one book, the whole thing's a sham. Your argument is a sham because of this drawing of results from no evidence.\n\n \n No, it's not because some people doubt the truth. Factually, a lot more people would say the divinity and/or truth of the Bible is false than would agree with it. Some scholars draw a dintinct difference between \"Biblical Jesus\", the savior of man, and the \"historical Jesus\", a discontent Hebrew who wanted political change. I beg you to read anything secular or Non-Christian, and you'll see what I mean.\n \n \nDon't answer a question with a question. Answer my question. Then ask your own.\n\n \n And I believe your question was \"How many miracles have occurred because of this war?\" Your answer: none. And now, how many verifiable miracles have occurred throughout the past 2000 years of Christianity? How many miracles that could NOT be mere coincidence or freak occurrance? Now answer that question, and you'll see why it's unnecessary.\n \n \nThis is why it's a poor analogy you've chosen again. Most wars...blah blah... We're comparing Christianity to the war in Iraq. What's Christianity got to do with 'most wars' anyway?\n\n \n Well, a lot. Remember how I was saying that the superiority of Christianity leads to bad things....? This is what I meant.\n \n Let's say you honestly believe that Saddam Hussein is the be-all, end-all of evil. The anti-Christ, even. Would you strive to destroy him? A great number of Christians with the power and ability to do so would most certainly do so.\n \n Christian Zionists, who literally pray for a holocaust to get into heaven, have a lot in common with Bush's neoconservative White House: \"a world of absolutes, a confrontation of good and evil with no compromise, only endless confrontation or absolute victory. It's no stretch of the imagination to see the Bush administration as the populist incarnation of the same message, with its \"evil-doer\" rhetoric and politics or perpetual war.\" (Adrian Hardie, AdBusters #49) Bush, himself, is an admittedly Christian fellow, commonly mentioning god in his speeches to justify his behavior and actions. Additionally, the Christian Coalition holds great sway in the Republican Party.\n \n George W. Bush is chasing this war because he believes Sadam is evil and that he is right. Christianity is behind this mindset.\n \n No, I've conducted no independent research, but then again, how much personal \"research\" have you put into the Bible yourself?\n \n \nAgain you've made a poor pap statement. Show me all the good that religion has done, and all the bad. How are you comparing the two. Show me the proof. Stop just making pass\u00e9 statements and back it up!\n\n \n Speaking for myself, it's not that Christianity or Catholicism is bad and some other way is good.... It's moreso that Catholicism is not the correct path, as if there were no other valid options. Myself and others falsely think that pointing out the flaws and wrongdoings in the name of your belief will make y'all realize how much the religion's superiority mindset affects the world.... my bad.\n \n \nI asked do your sources say that the Bible is fable? Yes/no?\n\n \n Perhaps no. So now a question: prove conclusively that the Bible is historically true, without any flaws or questions or holes.\n \n \n'Most of them' - which ones? 'existed long before' - how long? What a rubbish argument you keep making. Baseless generalisations.\n\n \n Most Americans like to buy things. This is not an invalid statement, yet there is no true evidence or research to prove this, just mere observation. You can tell that people like to buy things because they buy things.\n \n In that same way, blanket statements can be made about Christians/Catholics who talk about their faith. Most of those whom I hear defending their religion are very naive, thinking that god simply told one guy to write the Bible, Jesus stamped it with approval, and that's how we get our religion.\n \n Hardly anyone realizes or even acknowledges that the Bible in its current state was put together hundreds of years after the events in the book were said to pass. And this book went through many incarnations, with many editors, with many rewrites.\n \n When you don't believe me or when you tell me I'm wrong, you've just proven that 'most of' statement.\n \n \nShow me the proof that there were more books in the 'first bible'. What was the 'first bible' called? When was it put together, this 'first bible' of which you speak?\n\n \n It was called the Bible. It just wasn't complete with all the stuff you see in it today. It lacked Revelations, several Epistles, and was probably not as edited as it has become. Where's the proof? Read up on any website that talks about Biblical history (and you're cheating if you go to a Christian site), and you'll see how the book was put together.\n \n And your contrary proof that the King James Bible that's sitting on your desk is the only Bible ever created....?\n \n \nAre 'they'? 'They' seems to be your favourite subject.\n\n \n This is an informal message board. Would you rather type \"Biblical Scholars\" or \"Christians/Catholics\" over and over and over again??? That's why the English language has pronouns....\n \n \nSo what? Where I have suggested that the Bible wasn't composed later? All the books were written much earlier though. What's your point? Who cares that Greek Mythology existed longer? Who follows Greek Mythology? Aboriginal mythology is even older? Why do you keep throwing up 'facts' that have no bearing on your argument?\n\n \n The fact is that Catholicism isn't the one true religion, church, path, or whatever. Because there were sources for Christianity to draw from, we know that there's a precedent for a lot of stories. Jesus' story was probably drawn from the tales of Adonis or Osiris. Because we know that life existed before the Bible and that religions existed before the Bible, there is a great possibility that the Bible was influenced by other ideas on religion.\n \n \nWhat extent has it influenced Christianity anyway? How is 'turn the other cheek' and 'love thy neighbour' expressed in Greek Mythology? Are you therefore saying that it's Greek Mythology to blame for the Crusades and not Christ like you've been maintaining up till now?\n\n \n See above, first off.\n \n Secondly, Christ is to blame for nothing. The organized religion, which is a group of people who gather to share their beliefs, of Christianity/Catholicism causes a great many things. See above where I talk about the superiority complex.\n \n \n \nWe're arguing about Islam, so you bring in relativist about all religions; but in fact just concentrate on Christianity; as you have experienced it. Then you bring in the war on Iraq? Now Greek Mythology? Where's all this heading?\n\n \n You can't argue for or against Christianity/Catholicism in isolation. You have no proof of your statements, except the Bible. We have no proof except to say that your proof is invalid. So where are we in isolation? Square one. All things are related, so you have to be ready to argue all things.\n \n \nAh, a slight change in definition.! No where have I ever claimed that Jesus wrote anything. Show me where I did. I believe that the Bible is his teachings. That is a different thing entirely. Anyway, I asked you a question first. But you keep chickening out. Show me something that you disagree with that comes from Jesus. You answer me first. Then ask your question of me; not now a different question!\n\n \n You have never seen anyone write the Bible. So how do you know it's true? Can you provide evidence? Can you prove the Bible???\n \n \nShow me the teachings of Christ that have justified wars? Whether it's only attributed to him or his actual words, you can not. Your whole argument falls down because of your inability to answer this one point. It's impossible for you because you've shown how irrational you're argument is in the first place. You have some hatred of Christianity and you're unable to show any causality between Christ's teachings and wars undertaken in the name of Christ. But instead of showing this, you merely deal with side-issues like the history of the Bible. Forget that for a moment. Even if it was all made up by St.Paul, the words therein, who ever wrote them... show me which ones lead to the Crusades.\n\n \n It doesn't matter if the Bible says anything about war. The fact is, Catholicism goes off more than the Bible.... the catechism of the church was created in little meetings of religious leaders. If men are fallible, and religious leaders are men, these folks could certainly misinterpret anything from the Bible they wanted to.... and thus, could easily use some \"God will smite the evil\" quote, taken completely out of context, to kill some Jews or something. And we have historical evidence of the Crusades. So obviously, religion has something to do with it.\n \n \nBut then you're changed tact again, and now saying 'Greek Mythology' has had an influence. Why just 'Greek'? What about Babylonian? Where is the continuity in your argument? Where is your argument?\n\n \n There's a lot of influence in the Bible's stories, and I'm just glad, for once, that you're coming to grips with that. ;) \n \n Coz",

Remember how I was saying that the superiority of Christianity leads to bad things....?\n\n \n Hang on a minute? You were saying? Are you Charchuk? You say you're from Florida, and he says he's from Canada!\n \n \nThis is what I meant. Let's say you honestly believe that Saddam Hussein is the be-all, end-all of evil. The anti-Christ, even. Would you strive to destroy him? A great number of Christians with the power and ability to do so would most certainly do so. Christian Zionists, who literally pray for a holocaust to get into heaven, have a lot in common with Bush's neoconservative White House: \"a world of absolutes, a confrontation of good and evil with no compromise, only endless confrontation or absolute victory. It's no stretch of the imagination to see the Bush administration as the populist incarnation of the same message, with its \"evil-doer\" rhetoric and politics or perpetual war.\" (Adrian Hardie, AdBusters #49) Bush, himself, is an admittedly Christian fellow, commonly mentioning god in his speeches to justify his behavior and actions.\n\n \n And your point? Some people want to do something in the name of someone else. So what? If I say I want to kill because killacozzy has told me to, would you also give yourself up to police as an accomplice?\n \n \nAdditionally, the Christian Coalition holds great sway in the Republican Party.George W. Bush is chasing this war because he believes Sadam is evil and that he is right. Christianity is behind this mindset.\n\n \n I'm glad you recognise this, because on another post you, or that is to say Charchuk says that there's no link between modern laws and Christianity.\n \n \nNo, I've conducted no independent research, but then again, how much personal \"research\" have you put into the Bible yourself?\n\n \n For a start, as an Orthodox Christian (and this post is actually about Catholics, but this applies also) I don't just rely on the Bible. It is interesting that you have in fact gone all Protestant and just confined your argument on this. You've probably done so because most anti-Christians follow this normative approach. But I've read heaps on Holy Tradition. What about you? What about Holy Tradition have you researched, and which you object to?\n \n If you just want to stay on the Bible, then which of Jesus' teachings do you feel has/have cause the most grief?\n \n \nAgain you've made a poor pap statement. Show me all the good that religion has done, and all the bad. How are you comparing the two. Show me the proof. Stop just making pass\u00e9 statements and back it up!\n\n \n \nSpeaking for myself, it's not that Christianity or Catholicism is bad and some other way is good.... It's moreso that Catholicism is not the correct path, as if there were no other valid options. Myself and others falsely think that pointing out the flaws and wrongdoings in the name of your belief will make y'all realize how much the religion's superiority mindset affects the world.... my bad.\n\n \n \nI asked do your sources say that the Bible is fable? Yes/no?\n\n \n \nPerhaps no. So now a question: prove conclusively that the Bible is historically true, without any flaws or questions or holes.\n\n \n Why do I need to do this for you? How do you prove a negative?\n \n \n'Most of them' - which ones? 'existed long before' - how long? What a rubbish argument you keep making. Baseless generalisations.\n\n \n \nMost Americans like to buy things. This is not an invalid statement, yet there is no true evidence or research to prove this, just mere observation. You can tell that people like to buy things because they buy things.\n In that same way, blanket statements can be made about Christians/Catholics who talk about their faith. Most of those whom I hear defending their religion are very naive, thinking that god simply told one guy to write the Bible, Jesus stamped it with approval, and that's how we get our religion.\n\n \n What an absurd example. There's indexes of consumer spending all the time. Your whole nation depends on it. Who do store clerks think are wasting their time all the time? Aliens? Are you sure you're not really Charchuk? He makes absurd statements like this.\n \n \n Hardly anyone realizes or even acknowledges that the Bible in its current state was put together hundreds of years after the events in the book were said to pass. And this book went through many incarnations, with many editors, with many rewrites.\n When you don't believe me or when you tell me I'm wrong, you've just proven that 'most of' statement\n\n \n Why would I have proven 'the most of' statement anyway? I am just one person. I don't speak for all Catholics or Orthodox. Do you speak for all atheists?\n \n So your personal experience has taught you this. This then is the cause of your objections.\n \n You know some Christians who are bad, therefore Christianity is bad.\n \n You know some Christians who don't know how the Bible was put together, therefore all Christians don't know how the Bible was put together.\n \n That's a very egocentric view you have there. There is more to the world than your own experience. Perhaps that's why you demand of me to prove to you that the Bible is true.\n \n \nShow me the proof that there were more books in the 'first bible'. What was the 'first bible' called? When was it put together, this 'first bible' of which you speak?\n\n \n \nIt was called the Bible. It just wasn't complete with all the stuff you see in it today. It lacked Revelations, several Epistles, and was probably not as edited as it has become. Where's the proof? Read up on any website that talks about Biblical history (and you're cheating if you go to a Christian site), and you'll see how the book was put together.\n And your contrary proof that the King James Bible that's sitting on your desk is the only Bible ever created....?\n\n \n Did it? Where did you read that? Oh, that's right, and I can't go to a Christian site to find evidence, I have to find a site that is in agreement with you which means that the only evidence I can use is that which is in agreement with you. How circular.\n \n But anyway, I have read Testament by John Romer. You and he are in disagreement.\n \n \nAre 'they'? 'They' seems to be your favourite subject.\n\n \n \nThis is an informal message board. Would you rather type \"Biblical Scholars\" or \"Christians/Catholics\" over and over and over again??? That's why the English language has pronouns....\n\n \n As I said at the beginning, I'm asking this of Charchuk. He uses 'they' all the time, including in saying that 'they' have said things about me. I hardly believe that I can substitute 'Catholics' every time he uses the word 'they'. He uses 'they' to argue against Catholics too. How are you able to substitute Catholics all these times, it wouldn't make sense. So, the problem with his use of pronouns is he uses the one for all sorts of different groups, at the same time. Perhaps you don't have this problem, seeing as you two seem to be of one mind.\n \n \nSo what? Where I have suggested that the Bible wasn't composed later? All the books were written much earlier though. What's your point? Who cares that Greek Mythology existed longer? Who follows Greek Mythology? Aboriginal mythology is even older? Why do you keep throwing up 'facts' that have no bearing on your argument?\n\n \n \nThe fact is that Catholicism isn't the one true religion, church, path, or whatever. Because there were sources for Christianity to draw from, we know that there's a precedent for a lot of stories. Jesus' story was probably drawn from the tales of Adonis or Osiris. Because we know that life existed before the Bible and that religions existed before the Bible, there is a great possibility that the Bible was influenced by other ideas on religion.\n\n \n Show me Catholic web-sites that suggest that Christianity did not exist before the Bible\n \n \n What extent has it influenced Christianity anyway? How is 'turn the other cheek' and 'love thy neighbour' expressed in Greek Mythology? Are you therefore saying that it's Greek Mythology to blame for the Crusades and not Christ like you've been maintaining up till now?\n\n \n \nSee above, first off.\n Secondly, Christ is to blame for nothing. The organized religion, which is a group of people who gather to share their beliefs, of Christianity/Catholicism causes a great many things. See above where I talk about the superiority complex.\n\n \n I'm glad you're coming to grips with this. It seems you are able to answer this, but Charchuk can't.\n \n \nWe're arguing about Islam, so you bring in relativist about all religions; but in fact just concentrate on Christianity; as you have experienced it. Then you bring in the war on Iraq? Now Greek Mythology? Where's all this heading?\n\n \n \nYou can't argue for or against Christianity/Catholicism in isolation. You have no proof of your statements, except the Bible. We have no proof except to say that your proof is invalid. So where are we in isolation? Square one. All things are related, so you have to be ready to argue all things.\n\n \n Here is where I realised my mistake. I posted this and it was meant to be on Islam. Comparing Christianity to Islam is comparing chalk to cheese.\n \n \nAh, a slight change in definition.! No where have I ever claimed that Jesus wrote anything. Show me where I did. I believe that the Bible is his teachings. That is a different thing entirely. Anyway, I asked you a question first. But you keep chickening out. Show me something that you disagree with that comes from Jesus. You answer me first. Then ask your question of me; not now a different question!\n\n \n \nYou have never seen anyone write the Bible. So how do you know it's true? Can you provide evidence? Can you prove the Bible???\n\n \n I have never seen a planet in another solar system, but I'm told by authority that they are there. I never saw Ferdinand Magellan, but I am told by authority that he existed.\n \n \nShow me the teachings of Christ that have justified wars?...show me which ones lead to the Crusades.\n\n \n \nIt doesn't matter if the Bible says anything about war. The fact is, Catholicism goes off more than the Bible.... the catechism of the church was created in little meetings of religious leaders. If men are fallible, and religious leaders are men, these folks could certainly misinterpret anything from the Bible they wanted to.... and thus, could easily use some \"God will smite the evil\" quote, taken completely out of context, to kill some Jews or something. And we have historical evidence of the Crusades. So obviously, religion has something to do with it.\n\n \n Your logic would go: Kim Il Sung was a Marxist Atheist. He started the Korean War. Therefore it has something to do with Marxist atheism.\n \n \n But then you're changed tact again, and now saying 'Greek Mythology' has had an influence. Why just 'Greek'? What about Babylonian? Where is the continuity in your argument? Where is your argument?\n\n \n \nThere's a lot of influence in the Bible's stories, and I'm just glad, for once, that you're coming to grips with that. \n\n \n That's rather dishonest of you to say that. Show me where I have excluded influences or retract that snide statement. And also, where is his (Charchuk's argument). He just mentions that the Greek religion existed before the Bible. There is no connexion of this statement of fact to anything.",

Why do you keep throwing up 'facts' that have no bearing on your argument?\n\n \n You justify your belief by saying that since it has been around a long time than it must be true.

   "Killacozzy, it's good that Charchuk has a supporter. You have valiantly decided to try to answer all my questions of him.\n\n \n You make silly attacks and it sort of frustrates me that \"you people\" are so blind to understand what we're saying.\n \n Your claims of the Bible's divinity are religious claims. The Muslims believe that Mohammed's prophecies are divine. Jews believe in the Torah and such. Only the Christians believe that Jesus was god's son. You have no proof save a book that says it's true. And the other Judeo-Christian faiths have their books and documents of truth as well. So how can you say you have proof you're right? If such a claim is made, then Jesus both is and isn't the messiah. This clearly cannot be true in our world.\n \n This is the point we argue.\n \n \nHow do you know that 'they' as referred to by Charchuk are these people? He should answer this for himself, because you don't want to be putting words into his mouth. Are you really Charchuk?\n\n \n I didn't respond to this post mostly because you just try to cripple our argument by saying that I'm Charchuk. I'm not. I just agree with him, and since I was so frustrated by the post directed at him, I decided to jump back in.\n \n \nYou're doing the same thing. Your argument: Some people doubt the truth of the Bible therefore the whole Bible is false. You say 'factually a lot more people would say it is false'\n A lot more people than what?\n\n \n A lot more people would say it's false than would say it's true. Well, Christianity may be the most widespread faith on the planet, it's certainly not the faith with the most membership. I believe that just with Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, and Jews added together, you have more non-Christians than Christians.... not to mention the other religions (Shinto, Jainism, etc.). And though these other faiths may say Jesus is a prophet or an extremely holy individual, they would certainly disagree that Jesus was the messiah that would deliver mankind to the holy land. And since that's the one thing you must agree with to be a Christian, these people would disagree with your interpretation of the Bible, and also with the argument that the Bible alone is god's written word.\n \n \nIts pretty lame to throw such generalised statements about as Charchuk does without proof. Would you not say that Christianity is the single biggest faith in the world? After we have Islam, which respects the 'divinity' of the Bible. Judaism does too. The Dalai Lama says he respects the Bible; I'm not saying he speaks for all his followers. But where do you get your figures from?\n\n \n I respect the Bible as well, just as I respect myths from the Greeks or the Egyptians. They tell great tales and teach great lessons. But I don't believe that the Bible is the end-all and be-all of religion. And I don't believe that Jesus was the messiah. So am I Christian? No. Do I agree with your arguments? No. Thus, these other faiths/individuals would not agree with you.\n \n \nFirstly, he's trying to compare chalk and cheese; Christianity's history to the War in Iraq. He's not shown any link between the two. Heaps of good has come out of Christianity, very little I expect out of the War.\n\n \n That's a matter of opinion. Some Iraqi's would call America their savior. Others hate the country. History and events are fueled by people, who are not gods (in the traditional sense). Hence, some things that happen are good, some are bad. But when Christians start a war in the name of Jesus or their god, obviously something in their religion gave them the impression that this behavior was okay. Perhaps Jesus didn't order the attacks on Iraq or the Crusades, but when someone uses the Bible or their belief in the Bible as their justification for conflict and war, I blame the religion. Here, I blame Christianity for the aforementioned events.\n \n \nGo to http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm for a start on the definition of a miracle. And as you've agreed that no miracles have occurred in the war in Iraq, it means I need only bring forth one miracle to tip the scales.\n I suggest you visit http://www.sancta.org/ and follow the links.\n\n \n I checked your sites, the first being a Catholic encyclopedia, which is clearly biased. The second showed some shotty pictures of the eye of Our Lady of Guadalupe.... pictures that do not even really show anything, but merely suggest and impose the idea that there are images of Jesus or a family. Quite frankly, you've provided no evidence.\n \n \nHang on a minute? You were saying? Are you Charchuk? You say you're from Florida, and he says he's from Canada!\n\n \n Yes, I was the one talking about the superiority complex that Christianity creates a couple posts back. Great way to win an argument, though: \"You're Charchuk!!!\"\n \n \nAnd your point? Some people want to do something in the name of someone else. So what? If I say I want to kill because killacozzy has told me to, would you also give yourself up to police as an accomplice?\n\n \n If you read some book that I had written, created a religion based around it, and you and all those in the religion killed people in my name (or at least supported it), you and your religion would be to blame, not the book I wrote.\n \n In that same way, I don't blame the Bible for war..... I just don't think the Bible is the divine document that proves Christianity/Catholicism the true church, the only valid religion.\n \n \nI'm glad you recognise this, because on another post you, or that is to say Charchuk says that there's no link between modern laws and Christianity.\n\n \n Practically everything Western comes from Christianity. I dunno what Charchuk said about it. Now just because this civilization is based on Christianity doesn't mean it has a damn thing to do with it anymore. I think that people these days are wisely becoming more and more worldly... not choosing to boast of their religion. It's only a matter of time before the heathens rise up....!\n \n \nFor a start, as an Orthodox Christian (and this post is actually about Catholics, but this applies also) I don't just rely on the Bible. It is interesting that you have in fact gone all Protestant and just confined your argument on this. You've probably done so because most anti-Christians follow this normative approach. But I've read heaps on Holy Tradition. What about you? What about Holy Tradition have you researched, and which you object to?\n\n \n Well, since you rely on things other than the Bible, you're relying on someone else's translation/interpretation of those words. This leads to the \"sheep mentality\", where you follow someone who claims absolute authority (whether god-granted or not) blindly, without any evidence of truth necessary.\n \n But the fact is, without some kind of canonized scripture, Christianity would've been entirely free-form, what with the Gnostics runnin' rampant with their talk of self-realization and the individual search for the divine.... so, basically, the Roman's (who made Christianity the widespread faith it is now) comissioned to have a work put together to teach the holiness of Jesus. So hundreds of years after Christ, the official church put together its official book, selecting certain books, rejecting others, until they basically got the Bible. All further Christianity was based off this book, and since the church leaders only chose what they deemed the \"inspired\" works, the Bible was called divine, holy, and untouchable. Your religion is based off someone's interpretation and enforcement of the Bible. So, to disprove the Bible's divinity (which isn't hard, considering it hasn't even been proven divine, yet) is to disprove your religion is correct, or that is, the most or only correct.\n \n \nIf you just want to stay on the Bible, then which of Jesus' teachings do you feel has/have cause the most grief?\n\n \n None.... Jesus was sweet! If he actually existed, which is highly probable, he was probably taught many Eastern ideas between ages 12 and 30 on his travels to Asia. I think he was very wise, but through interpretation, he becomes some little lackey to god. That makes him suck as opposed to him being a wise teacher or rabbi.\n \n \nWhy do I need to do this for you? How do you prove a negative?\n\n \n If we must provide evidence of our claims, you must reciprocate. But when you use your Christian propaganda (which you probably don't see as such), you use a biased argument. Science is unbiased..... not blind faith.\n \n \nWhat an absurd example. There's indexes of consumer spending all the time. Your whole nation depends on it. Who do store clerks think are wasting their time all the time? Aliens? Are you sure you're not really Charchuk? He makes absurd statements like this.\n\n \n You have such high standards, as no analogies we can make will work. Nothing is the same as Christianity.... so you must be right, eh?\n \n Well I know for a fact that Jews don't believe Jesus was the Messiah. There's no polls or indexes-effectively no evidence-but I KNOW Jews don't believe that Jesus was the exclusive son of god. How's that one?\n \n \nWhy would I have proven 'the most of' statement anyway? I am just one person. I don't speak for all Catholics or Orthodox. Do you speak for all atheists?\n\n \n Give me a Catholic or Christian who would say otherwise, and I will revoke my argument.\n \n \nSo your personal experience has taught you this. This then is the cause of your objections.\n \n You know some Christians who are bad, therefore Christianity is bad.\n \n You know some Christians who don't know how the Bible was put together, therefore all Christians don't know how the Bible was put together.\n \n That's a very egocentric view you have there. There is more to the world than your own experience. Perhaps that's why you demand of me to prove to you that the Bible is true.\n\n \n Christianity is not bad, nor do all Christians not know how the Bible was put together. I don't make absolute statements like that, or at least I try to avoid it.\n \n I just don't think the Catholic church or the Christian religion is the one truth. I think it's true for some, not true for others. Either way, I'm not going to hell for rejecting god or Jesus. If that makes the religions I just mentioned incorrect or wrong, then they're incorrect and wrong.\n \n I don't think the world is dependent on me; I have no egocentricism of which to speak. It's just a sort of arrogance on the part of Christianity and Catholicism..... I mean, you look at outer space, count the stars, the odds of those stars having planets, of those planets supporting life.... and yet, we as humans tend to say \"there's no aliens!\".... in the same way you all arrogantly claim that Jesus is the only way to heaven... that the Bible (with New and Old Testaments included) is the only real divine scripture....\n \n To pass judgments, to cause guilt, to allow suffering, to justify war.... this is what religious superlatives have created..... Christianity isn't the only way, just the way for some.... I'm not going to hell because I reject Jesus, not because the pope says so, because some book says so, or because you say so.... re-examine yourself.... realize who has the ego here.\n \n \nDid it? Where did you read that? Oh, that's right, and I can't go to a Christian site to find evidence, I have to find a site that is in agreement with you which means that the only evidence I can use is that which is in agreement with you. How circular.\n\n \n Just because you can't use Christian sites doesn't mean all the evidence is in my/our favor. Science isn't atheism.... it's agnosticism.... science only goes off evidence, and doesn't disclaim what it can prove. But if science does disprove something, science is correct. Don't go to anti-Christian sites, just go to sites that aren't paid for and sponsors by Catholic/Christian/Evangelist propagandists.\n \n \nBut anyway, I have read Testament by John Romer. You and he are in disagreement.\n\n \n Fair. I can agree to disagree.... I'll have to look into what he claims as evidence..... (if he has any)\n \n \nAs I said at the beginning, I'm asking this of Charchuk. He uses 'they' all the time, including in saying that 'they' have said things about me. I hardly believe that I can substitute 'Catholics' every time he uses the word 'they'. He uses 'they' to argue against Catholics too. How are you able to substitute Catholics all these times, it wouldn't make sense. So, the problem with his use of pronouns is he uses the one for all sorts of different groups, at the same time. Perhaps you don't have this problem, seeing as you two seem to be of one mind.\n\n \n I hate typing out the words \"Christian\" and \"Catholic\" and \"Christian scholars\" and \"secular scholars\" and so on and so forth..... I'm fairly sure you can understand who I'm referencing, as well as who Charchuk is referencing.... so let's just drop the technicalities.\n \n \nShow me Catholic web-sites that suggest that Christianity did not exist before the Bible\n\n \n I never claimed that.... but Christianity could not have existed before the year 30 AD. And since other religions existed before that, mythologies from other belief systems were melded together to create the Christian mythos.... why is that so hard to comprehend???\n \n \nI'm glad you're coming to grips with this. It seems you are able to answer this, but Charchuk can't.\n\n \n Neither of us have ever blamed Jesus for the world's problems. We blame men who believe in the divine and absolute power of the religion that is Christianity. Ya know, the superiority complex thing I keep referring to....???\n \n \nHere is where I realised my mistake. I posted this and it was meant to be on Islam. Comparing Christianity to Islam is comparing chalk to cheese.\n\n \n No, it's like comparing Swiss cheese to Provolone cheese. Religion is religion, no matter the god(s) you worship. Quit trying to act like things don't relate.\n \n \nI have never seen a planet in another solar system, but I'm told by authority that they are there. I never saw Ferdinand Magellan, but I am told by authority that he existed.\n\n \n But if you so chose someone could allow you to see another planet. Likewise, I'm sure Magellan existed due to the discoveries documented in his name. No one ever documented Jesus except for those who wrote the Bible. Also, you can't prove that the writers of the Bible were god-inspired. You will never be able to do so..... it's simply beyond proving. Therefore, the Bible (a singular document) is thrown out as evidence to prove the case for Christianity/Catholicism.\n \n \nYour logic would go: Kim Il Sung was a Marxist Atheist. He started the Korean War. Therefore it has something to do with Marxist atheism.\n\n \n Indirectly, yes.\n \n \nThat's rather dishonest of you to say that. Show me where I have excluded influences or retract that snide statement. And also, where is his (Charchuk's argument). He just mentions that the Greek religion existed before the Bible. There is no connexion of this statement of fact to anything.\n\n \n Look, the Bible is just too similar to other pre-Biblical texts.... myths, legends.... from Greek to Babylonian to Egyptian.... there's more, I'm just not able to name the countless others.....\n \n The point is, that all things influenced the Bible.... and so, the Bible is just a myth.... a legend.... a collection of parables that teach great lessons for their times.... and nothing of divinity or religious superiority....\n \n The Bible has as much foundation in truth as any other myths.... I just hope that in time, people will realize it and band together.... instead of drawing lines in the sand to seperate our world.",

   "Killacozzy, it's good that Charchuk has a supporter....\n\n \n \nYou make silly attacks and it sort of frustrates me that \"you people\" are so blind to understand what we're saying. Your claims of the Bible's divinity are religious claims. The Muslims believe that Mohammed's prophecies are divine. Jews believe in the Torah and such. Only the Christians believe that Jesus was god's son. You have no proof save a book that says it's true. And the other Judeo-Christian faiths have their books and documents of truth as well. So how can you say you have proof you're right? If such a claim is made, then Jesus both is and isn't the messiah. This clearly cannot be true in our world.\n This is the point we argue.\n\n \n Which is wrong. I don't just have the Bible. I told you, I'm an Orthodox Christian. But you deal with that later, so I will defer till then.\n \n \nHow do you know that 'they' as referred to by Charchuk are these people? He should answer this for himself, because you don't want to be putting words into his mouth. Are you really Charchuk?\n\n \n \nI didn't respond to this post mostly because you just try to cripple our argument by saying that I'm Charchuk. I'm not. I just agree with him, and since I was so frustrated by the post directed at him, I decided to jump back in.\n\n \n And you said that 'they' as referred to by him was the Catholic Church. You criticised me by suggesting it was so obvious that he didn't need to use anything other than a pronoun. I suggested otherwise. I'm not trying to cripple your argument by claiming you're Charchuk. But when you respond to my address to him in the first person such as \"I said this...\" not \"he said this\" then it did strike me as odd. You both seemed to have problems with what pronouns to use.\n \n \nYou're doing the same thing. Your argument: Some people doubt the truth of the Bible therefore the whole Bible is false. You say 'factually a lot more people would say it is false'\n A lot more people than what?\n\n \n \nA lot more people would say it's false than would say it's true. Well, Christianity may be the most widespread faith on the planet, it's certainly not the faith with the most membership. I believe that just with Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, and Jews added together, you have more non-Christians than Christians.... not to mention the other religions (Shinto, Jainism, etc.). And though these other faiths may say Jesus is a prophet or an extremely holy individual, they would certainly disagree that Jesus was the messiah that would deliver mankind to the holy land. And since that's the one thing you must agree with to be a Christian, these people would disagree with your interpretation of the Bible, and also with the argument that the Bible alone is god's written word.\n\n \n Shintos are a pluralist belief which I doubt you'd find any who say that the Bible hasn't any divine inspiration. Baha'i would accept the truth of the Bible as being divine. Jews and Muslims certainly do. Christians do, of course. The Dalai Lama does. In fact many eastern religions are so live and let live that they accept these things. \n \n Your truism 'There are more Christians than non-Christians.' Your/his argument was that there was no truth there, because there were more non-Christians, I can see you refining his argument to deal solely with the divinity of Christ.\n \n But even here your maths argument is a nonsense. Charchuk believes in evolution. When Darwin brought forth his hypothesis, most people in the world didn't believe in it, and probably this is still the case. By your maths argument, until 50.1% of the world's population believe in it, it has no value, 'cause it isn't true. Or, is it 50.1% of the world's adult population?\n \n \nIts pretty lame to throw such generalised statements about as Charchuk does without proof. Would you not say that Christianity is the single biggest faith in the world? After we have Islam, which respects the 'divinity' of the Bible. Judaism does too. The Dalai Lama says he respects the Bible; I'm not saying he speaks for all his followers. But where do you get your figures from?\n\n \n \nI respect the Bible as well, just as I respect myths from the Greeks or the Egyptians. They tell great tales and teach great lessons. But I don't believe that the Bible is the end-all and be-all of religion. And I don't believe that Jesus was the messiah. So am I Christian? No. Do I agree with your arguments? No. Thus, these other faiths/individuals would not agree with you.\n\n \n Unless, you're still arguing on the change of focus you made, which Charchuk did not. Islam doesn't just 'respect' the Bible. It's a nice shift of emphasis of yours, but it doesn't work. The Baha'i, and Jews also don't just 'respect' the Bible.\n \n \nFirstly, he's trying to compare chalk and cheese; Christianity's history to the War in Iraq. He's not shown any link between the two. Heaps of good has come out of Christianity, very little I expect out of the War.\n\n \n \nThat's a matter of opinion. Some Iraqi's would call America their savior. Others hate the country. History and events are fuelled by people, who are not gods (in the traditional sense). Hence, some things that happen are good, some are bad. \n\n \n You can't compare the two. 2,000 years of glory, art, music, literature and belief - even if you think it's all flawed, is nothing compared to the War in Iraq. It's absolutely ridiculous for you to go into bat on this one.\n \n \nBut when Christians start a war in the name of Jesus or their god, obviously something in their religion gave them the impression that this behavior was okay. Perhaps Jesus didn't order the attacks on Iraq or the Crusades, but when someone uses the Bible or their belief in the Bible as their justification for conflict and war, I blame the religion. Here, I blame Christianity for the aforementioned events.\n\n \n Fair enough. Hitler used science to justify the extermination of the lesser races. By your logic, I will now blame science for this, as there must be something in science that allows for this sort of thing.\n \n \nGo to http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10338a.htm for a start on the definition of a miracle. And as you've agreed that no miracles have occurred in the war in Iraq, it means I need only bring forth one miracle to tip the scales.\n I suggest you visit http://www.sancta.org/ and follow the links.\n\n \n \nI checked your sites, the first being a Catholic encyclopedia, which is clearly biased.\n\n \n No kidding! You mean they're not pushing the Koran? When did that happen?\n \n \nThe second showed some shotty pictures of the eye of Our Lady of Guadalupe.... pictures that do not even really show anything, but merely suggest and impose the idea that there are images of Jesus or a family. Quite frankly, you've provided no evidence.\n\n \n You've effectively dismissed the whole site with your last sentence. I have provided evidence. You reject it. I will do no more on this account. It is for others reading this engagement who are more open-minded to decide.\n \n \nHang on a minute? You were saying? Are you Charchuk? You say you're from Florida, and he says he's from Canada!\n\n \n \nYes, I was the one talking about the superiority complex that Christianity creates a couple posts back. Great way to win an argument, though: \"You're Charchuk!!!\"\n\n \n As I say, you keep mixing up your pronouns so it's difficult to determine with whom you speak.\n \n \nAnd your point? Some people want to do something in the name of someone else. So what? If I say I want to kill because killacozzy has told me to, would you also give yourself up to police as an accomplice?\n\n \n \nIf you read some book that I had written, created a religion based around it, and you and all those in the religion killed people in my name (or at least supported it), you and your religion would be to blame, not the book I wrote.\n In that same way, I don't blame the Bible for war..... I just don't think the Bible is the divine document that proves Christianity/Catholicism the true church, the only valid religion.\n\n \n It's a nice example. But I'd like a yes or no answer to my question.\n \n \nI'm glad you recognise this, because on another post you, or that is to say Charchuk says that there's no link between modern laws and Christianity.\n\n \n \nPractically everything Western comes from Christianity. I dunno what Charchuk said about it. Now just because this civilization is based on Christianity doesn't mean it has a damn thing to do with it anymore. I think that people these days are wisely becoming more and more worldly... not choosing to boast of their religion. It's only a matter of time before the heathens rise up....!\n\n \n Why are heathens more right than Christians? You do know heathens believe in god(s).\n \n \nFor a start, as an Orthodox Christian (and this post is actually about Catholics, but this applies also) I don't just rely on the Bible. It is interesting that you have in fact gone all Protestant and just confined your argument on this. You've probably done so because most anti-Christians follow this normative approach.

So, to disprove the Bible's divinity (which isn't hard, considering it hasn't even been proven divine, yet) is to disprove your religion is correct, or that is, the most or only correct.\n\n \n It's a long passage. You've not answered the question I asked. But anyway. You show a distinct lack of understanding of Holy Tradition; your objections are very Protestant. Holy Tradition existed before the Bible. The books that made up the Bible had existed from quite early on. The Early church used Holy Tradition. It is that oral tradition that they used to help guide them in the selection\n Not all books that aren't in the Bible were rejected at all! Your ignorance, as I say, is very Protestant. The Didache isn't in the Bible, but used by my Church, the Epistles of St. Clement of Rome, and St. Ignatius of Antioch also. There's a whole raft of them. The Didache dates from c.150 and contains some things such as the practice of the Eucharist. Protestants reject this, because the Didache is not in the Bible. Your Bible-only argument needs to be re-worked.\n \n The Church lived for those hundreds of years between Jesus' resurrection and the compilation of the Bible. The later event didn't just suddenly occur. The Emperor didn't just wake up one day and say to the Church... \"How about puttin' a Bible together that makes me look good?\". There was commentary between bishops on early books. Already many had been condemned by the Church as being unholy. The church corresponded on hot issues of debate such as this.\n \n \nIf you just want to stay on the Bible, then which of Jesus' teachings do you feel has/have cause the most grief?\n\n \n \nNone.... Jesus was sweet! If he actually existed, which is highly probable, he was probably taught many Eastern ideas between ages 12 and 30 on his travels to Asia. I think he was very wise, but through interpretation, he becomes some little lackey to god. That makes him suck as opposed to him being a wise teacher or rabbi.\n\n \n Firstly, Jesus didn't travel to Asia. He was already in it. But on these travel... you picked up this knowledge where? Why is it more trustworthy than the Bible? The rationale behind why you accept and reject evidences is to me unfathomable.\n \n \nWhy do I need to do this for you? How do you prove a negative?\n\n \n \nIf we must provide evidence of our claims, you must reciprocate. But when you use your Christian propaganda (which you probably don't see as such), you use a biased argument. Science is unbiased..... not blind faith.\n\n \n You haven't provided evidence for your claims. You makes suppositions about what most people say or believe. You even talk about Jesus' mysterious travels and provide no evidence. And if you present a web-site, I can do as you did, say I visited it, but then say \"It provides no real evidence\".\n \n \nWhat an absurd example. There's indexes of consumer spending all the time. Your whole nation depends on it. Who do store clerks think are wasting their time all the time? Aliens? Are you sure you're not really Charchuk? He makes absurd statements like this.\n\n \n \nYou have such high standards, as no analogies we can make will work. Nothing is the same as Christianity.... so you must be right, eh?\n Well I know for a fact that Jews don't believe Jesus was the Messiah. There's no polls or indexes?effectively no evidence?but I KNOW Jews don't believe that Jesus was the exclusive son of god. How's that one?\n\n \n And your point? The analogy you gave before was ludicrous. I'm sorry this has only just dawned on you. Now to the Jews. By you labelling a person a Jew, you've already established certain attributes with regard to faith. You would not need to poll them, because you've already established what they believe in! I'm sorry you've presented another Ubersuck of an analogy.\n \n \nSo your personal experience has taught you this. This then is the cause of your objections.\n You know some Christians who are bad, therefore Christianity is bad.\n You know some Christians who don't know how the Bible was put together, therefore all Christians don't know how the Bible was put together.\n That's a very egocentric view you have there. There is more to the world than your own experience. Perhaps that's why you demand of me to prove to you that the Bible is true.\n\n \n \nChristianity is not bad, nor do all Christians not know how the Bible was put together. I don't make absolute statements like that, or at least I try to avoid it.\n I just don't think the Catholic church or the Christian religion is the one truth. I think it's true for some, not true for others. Either way, I'm not going to hell for rejecting god or Jesus. If that makes the religions I just mentioned incorrect or wrong, then they're incorrect and wrong.\n I don't think the world is dependent on me; I have no egocentricism of which to speak. It's just a sort of arrogance on the part of Christianity and Catholicism.....

Christianity isn't the only way, just the way for some.... I'm not going to hell because I reject Jesus, not because the pope says so, because some book says so, or because you say so.... re-examine yourself.... realize who has the ego here.\n\n \n If you don't think Christianity is bad, then this is probably the only one area you disagree with Charchuk\n \n \n \nDid it? Where did you read that? Oh, that's right, and I can't go to a Christian site to find evidence, I have to find a site that is in agreement with you which means that the only evidence I can use is that which is in agreement with you. How circular.\n\n \n \nJust because you can't use Christian sites doesn't mean all the evidence is in my/our favor. Science isn't atheism.... it's agnosticism.... science only goes off evidence, and doesn't disclaim what it can prove. But if science does disprove something, science is correct. Don't go to anti-Christian sites, just go to sites that aren't paid for and sponsors by Catholic/Christian/Evangelist propagandists.\n\n \n Your faith in science shows your bias. What evidence is there already for extra-terrestrial life? If none, the go speak to the scientists at SETI. Scientists are flawed humans too, who like you and I work on a priori ideas. Otherwise you're suggesting that scientists just sit around waiting for something to be observed before they can act.... or do they actually hypothesise?\n \n \nBut anyway, I have read Testament by John Romer. You and he are in disagreement.\n\n \n \nFair. I can agree to disagree.... I'll have to look into what he claims as evidence..... (if he has any)\n\n \n Did you want me to present some of his statements?\n \n \nAs I said at the beginning, I'm asking this of Charchuk.

He uses 'they' to argue against Catholics too. How are you able to substitute Catholics all these times, it wouldn't make sense. So, the problem with his use of pronouns is he uses the one for all sorts of different groups, at the same time. Perhaps you don't have this problem, seeing as you two seem to be of one mind.\n\n \n \nI hate typing out the words \"Christian\" and \"Catholic\" and \"Christian scholars\" and \"secular scholars\" and so on and so forth..... I'm fairly sure you can understand who I'm referencing, as well as who Charchuk is referencing.... so let's just drop the technicalities.\n\n \n You missed the point - on purpose. He uses the one pronoun even when he's changed whom he refers to. It's hard to follow him when in the same paragraph he uses 'they' when 'they' can be two totally different people/groups.\n \n \nI'm glad you're coming to grips with this. It seems you are able to answer this, but Charchuk can't.\n\n \n \nNeither of us have ever blamed Jesus for the world's problems. We blame men who believe in the divine and absolute power of the religion that is Christianity. Ya know, the superiority complex thing I keep referring to....???\n\n \n I know you want to defend Charchuck, but again, you should not speak for him. It's one thing to agree with him, but to actually re-word his assertions as you now do is silly or dishonest.\n \n \nHere is where I realised my mistake. I posted this and it was meant to be on Islam. Comparing Christianity to Islam is comparing chalk to cheese.\n\n \n \nNo, it's like comparing Swiss cheese to Provolone cheese. Religion is religion, no matter the god(s) you worship. Quit trying to act like things don't relate.\n\n \n It might seem so to you. I'll make it simple for you. That's like me saying Marxist Science, Christian Science, Evolutionary Science, Flat-earth Science are all the same, because they're all science. Get it?\n \n \nI have never seen a planet in another solar system, but I'm told by authority that they are there. I never saw Ferdinand Magellan, but I am told by authority that he existed.\n\n \n \nBut if you so chose someone could allow you to see another planet. Likewise, I'm sure Magellan existed due to the discoveries documented in his name. No one ever documented Jesus except for those who wrote the Bible. Also, you can't prove that the writers of the Bible were god-inspired. You will never be able to do so..... it's simply beyond proving. Therefore, the Bible (a singular document) is thrown out as evidence to prove the case for Christianity/Catholicism.\n\n \n What a silly thing again to say. How do you know it was Magellan who wrote the documents, and not Mrs Smith from down the road? Your a priori reasoning rejects Jesus so therefore all evidence pointing to him is likewise rejected. You have no reason to doubt Magellan's existence, therefore all evidence of Magellan is admissible. All you are doing is showing the axioms to which you act.\n \n Also, Catholics and Orthodox don't just have a singular document.\n \n \nYour logic would go: Kim Il Sung was a Marxist Atheist. He started the Korean War. Therefore it has something to do with Marxist atheism.\n\n \n \nIndirectly, yes.\n\n \n So therefore we should blame all Marxist atheists.\n \n \nThat's rather dishonest of you to say that. Show me where I have excluded influences or retract that snide statement. And also, where is his (Charchuk's argument). He just mentions that the Greek religion existed before the Bible. There is no connexion of this statement of fact to anything.\n\n \n \nLook, the Bible is just too similar to other pre-Biblical texts.... myths, legends.... from Greek to Babylonian to Egyptian.... there's more, I'm just not able to name the countless others.....\n The point is, that all things influenced the Bible.... and so, the Bible is just a myth.... a legend.... a collection of parables that teach great lessons for their times.... and nothing of divinity or religious superiority....\n The Bible has as much foundation in truth as any other myths.... I just hope that in time, people will realize it and band together.... instead of drawing lines in the sand to separate our world.\n\n \n Yes, I'm sure you can find a Greek equal to the Trinity, to Jesus being sent to save mankind.\n \n Your logic: Aristotle used scientific method to prove the world flat. Scientist use the same kind of methods. Therefore science is flawed.\n \n \nMutually exclusive claims can not be equal. Actually, I suppose you could be forgiven this if you believe in evolution, where theories of gradual, extreme, and moderate change all sit easily within it. Where there are several mutually exclusive theories as to the rise of man etc.\n\n \n \nThat would be true were it that each exclusive claim were actually true.\n\n \n No, it would be true if one of the exclusive claims was actually true.\n \n \nAll religious statements are equal because they all lack conclusive evidence of their validity.... so what he's really saying here is: If you say that god is a t-bone steak, and I say that god is a small, horny pig, we're both equally correct.\n\n \n Again you want to put words into his mouth.",

   "Before Irenaeus wrote Against the Heresies, there were countless gospels and other Christian religious texts.... he basically created the orthodoxy.... he limited the gospels to four.... and others after him limited the Bible further, basically as a statement against the Gnostics.... it was changed further in the twelfth century when the King James Bible was created.... and that's where we get the Bible from today. Any more questions???\n\n \n Just a few more questions...\n \n You stated that there was another Bible. Are you now saying that this existed before or after Irenaeus?\n \n That there were books that are in the Bible around is an established fact. We both agree. Why does this mean that there was a pre-Bible Bible?\n \n The books existed by themselves, or as a few groups of books. They were widely circulated and discussed. The compilation of the Bible happened, but not all books excluded were 'rejected'.\n \n You fail to understand this as you're probably influenced by Protestants who's Christianity is sola fide.\n \n For Orthodox and Catholics, books excluded, such as the Didache, the Gospels of St. Clement, and St. Ignatius are still available. They are also studied and quoted.\n \n We have 2,000 years of writting. The writting didn't begin at the Bible, nor did it end there. The fact you mention another book; \"Against the heresies\" shows this. Many books were written by Christians.

   "Fair enough. Hitler used science to justify the extermination of the lesser races.\n\n \n I don't think that's a good analogy. Hitler argued for and acted under the philosphical theory of Nazism.

Science was one of many tools manipulated to support Nazism, and many people argue that any science that came from Nazis shouldn't be used because of that association.\n \n Besides which, the Chuch is not just a belief system, but an organization.

   "Group together, my allies!\n \n \nWhich is wrong. I don't just have the Bible. I told you, I'm an Orthodox Christian. But you deal with that later, so I will defer till then.\n\n \n I know that other books exist besides the Bible that influence Christianity.... but the fact is, you draw a distinguishing line between the Bible, and say, the Gospel of Thomas. How do you go about saying which documents are inspired and which are heresy? The only book Christians consistently call divine in agreeance is the Bible.\n \n Now, if you're allowed to pick and choose which books are holy and which aren't, why can't we non-Christians do the same? It's not that we're just attacking books randomly.... or is it? What criteria have you for determining the holiness of a work? My criterium is that there must be documented proof that god inspired the book in question. What...? No proof...?\n \n Well, there goes all your religious documentation.\n \n And your criteria for judging which \"scientific\" statements are viable in this debate? Oh, you mean the Pope and/or other religious figures must've sanctioned them? I understand now....\n \n \nAnd you said that 'they' as referred to by him was the Catholic Church. You criticised me by suggesting it was so obvious that he didn't need to use anything other than a pronoun. I suggested otherwise. I'm not trying to cripple your argument by claiming you're Charchuk. But when you respond to my address to him in the first person such as \"I said this...\" not \"he said this\" then it did strike me as odd. You both seemed to have problems with what pronouns to use.\n\n \n Just drop it. You're nitpicking on stupid words. He used all the correct pronouns.... as \"them\" and \"they\" pretty much describe all groups of people and/or organizations.\n \n \nShintos are a pluralist belief which I doubt you'd find any who say that the Bible hasn't any divine inspiration. Baha'i would accept the truth of the Bible as being divine. Jews and Muslims certainly do. Christians do, of course. The Dalai Lama does. In fact many eastern religions are so live and let live that they accept these things.\n\n \n These facts are true.... but if you look into it, you've taken it all out of context. Eastern religions believe pretty much everything is divine. How nice to support your argument by only mentioning your books. The Jews and Muslims both think Jesus was a prophet, nothing more; so there goes your New Testament support, since Christianity depends on the belief of Jesus as Messiah and savior.\n \n I myself agree with the Eastern faiths.... the Bible is inspired, but so are the words I write now. Care to compare this post to the Bible next???\n \n \n \nYour truism 'There are more Christians than non-Christians.' Your/his argument was that there was no truth there, because there were more non-Christians, I can see you refining his argument to deal solely with the divinity of Christ.\n\n \n I believe the debate here is whether or not Christianity/Catholicism is the \"one true church\" (or faith).... ask Charchuk.... maybe you can get him on using \"they\" instead of \"Christians....\"\n \n \nBut even here your maths argument is a nonsense. Charchuk believes in evolution. When Darwin brought forth his hypothesis, most people in the world didn't believe in it, and probably this is still the case. By your maths argument, until 50.1% of the world's population believe in it, it has no value, 'cause it isn't true. Or, is it 50.1% of the world's adult population?\n\n \n Percentages don't mean anything, nor did I suggest they would (\"they\", by the way, refers to the percentages I just mentioned :) .\n \n I believe in evolution, but it has tons more evidence than Christians have of the divinity of the Bible. Please, prove me wrong by providing evidence that the Bible is god-inspired.\n \n \nUnless, you're still arguing on the change of focus you made, which Charchuk did not. Islam doesn't just 'respect' the Bible. It's a nice shift of emphasis of yours, but it doesn't work. The Baha'i, and Jews also don't just 'respect' the Bible.\n\n \n It rejects the notion that Christ was the messiah. Muslims use the Koran, if I'm not mistaken, as their holy text. Jews use the Old Testament. Since the whole damn point of the New Testament is to show that Jesus was the messiah-and these three faiths you mentioned don't agree with it-I think it's fairly safe to say that they \"reject\" the New Testament (or at least its ideals, proving that there are more non-Christians than Christians).\n \n \nYou can't compare the two. 2,000 years of glory, art, music, literature and belief - even if you think it's all flawed, is nothing compared to the War in Iraq. It's absolutely ridiculous for you to go into bat on this one.\n\n \n It's the same idea.... believing the truth of something-be it a cause, a document, a person (or all of the above)-and basically putting lives on the line for that, whether those lives be on the side of \"good\" or \"evil\". In war, one person believes they're so correct, they'll kill for it. Likewise with Christianity.... especially with the historic events of the Crusades, the Witch Trials, the constant havok wreaked during the first century of Christianity's existance.\n \n How ridiculous is it really?\n \n \nFair enough. Hitler used science to justify the extermination of the lesser races. By your logic, I will now blame science for this, as there must be something in science that allows for this sort of thing.\n\n \n Science is not a group of people. Science is a method, and the way those methods are put into use is the equivalent of how people interpret the Bible.... which basically speaks of a method of living.\n \n You can blame Hitler's twist on science-you can blame the Nazis and their propaganda-but you can't blame science itself.\n \n Just as such, I can blame Christianity's twist on scriptures-I can blame the Christians and their propaganda-but I can't blame the Bible or Jesus.\n \n \nNo kidding! You mean they're not pushing the Koran? When did that happen?\n\n \n Well, the way you speak of it, they worship Jesus, too, since they agree with all of Christianity.\n \n \nYou've effectively dismissed the whole site with your last sentence. I have provided evidence. You reject it. I will do no more on this account. It is for others reading this engagement who are more open-minded to decide.\n\n \n You have provided nothing! Those images were hardly any \"hidden\" pictures of Jesus or a family. My fianc\u00e9e was passing by and without informing her as to what she was looking for, I asked her if she saw an image within the eye of the statue. She saw nothing. I went to other sites about your \"evidence\"-ones that did not highlight the areas where the suggested images are supposed to be.... and well, I was less than convinced. Funny, the site I went to was Christian as well, but curiously, without the suggestion and outline of what I was supposed to be seeing, there was nothing but a statue's eye. Seeing images within holy statues and paintings won't convince me, since these things are coincidence. When you want to believe something, I guess you'll make a mountain out of a molehill.\n \n \nAs I say, you keep mixing up your pronouns so it's difficult to determine with whom you speak.\n\n \n \"They\" and \"Them\" are consistently and correctly used throughout. If you can't follow our speech.... well.... I dunno what to tell you....\n \n \nAnd your point? Some people want to do something in the name of someone else. So what? If I say I want to kill because killacozzy has told me to, would you also give yourself up to police as an accomplice?\n\n \n \nIf you read some book that I had written, created a religion based around it, and you and all those in the religion killed people in my name (or at least supported it), you and your religion would be to blame, not the book I wrote.\n In that same way, I don't blame the Bible for war..... I just don't think the Bible is the divine document that proves Christianity/Catholicism the true church, the only valid religion.\n\n \n \nIt's a nice example. But I'd like a yes or no answer to my question.\n\n \n Such childishness.... I basically answered your question.... but if you really need validation for your belief, here you are: no, I would not turn myself in.... why?\n \n \nIf you read some book that I had written, created a religion based around it, and you and all those in the religion killed people in my name (or at least supported it), you and your religion would be to blame, not the book I wrote.\n In that same way, I don't blame the Bible for war..... I just don't think the Bible is the divine document that proves Christianity/Catholicism the true church, the only valid religion.\n\n \n Are you pleased? You see, the Bible is not to blame.... it's a good book.... but when ignorant and prejudiced people use the book-twist it to do bad (like your Hitler example)-the people twisting it are bad. So, the Christians are bad, but not the Bible.\n \n \nWhy are heathens more right than Christians? You do know heathens believe in god(s).\n\n \n As someone clearly stated in a previous post, heathens do not believe in gods.... at least not in the traditional sense.... it's humorous that you use comments made in jest to try and win the argument.... since you have no argument, gotta pin me with whatever you can, eh? ;) \n \n \nFor a start, as an Orthodox Christian (and this post is actually about Catholics, but this applies also) I don't just rely on the Bible. It is interesting that you have in fact gone all Protestant and just confined your argument on this. You've probably done so because most anti-Christians follow this normative approach. But I've read heaps on Holy Tradition. What about you? What about Holy Tradition have you researched, and which you object to?\n\n \n \nWell, since you rely on things other than the Bible, you're relying on someone else's translation/interpretation of those words. This leads to the \"sheep mentality\", where you follow someone who claims absolute authority (whether god-granted or not) blindly, without any evidence of truth necessary.\n But the fact is, without some kind of canonized scripture, Christianity would've been entirely free-form, what with the Gnostics runnin' rampant with their talk of self-realization and the individual search for the divine.... so, basically, the Roman's (who made Christianity the widespread faith it is now) commissioned to have a work put together to teach the holiness of Jesus. So hundreds of years after Christ, the official church put together its official book, selecting certain books, rejecting others, until they basically got the Bible. All further Christianity was based off this book, and since the church leaders only chose what they deemed the \"inspired\" works, the Bible was called divine, holy, and untouchable. Your religion is based off someone's interpretation and enforcement of the Bible. So, to disprove the Bible's divinity (which isn't hard, considering it hasn't even been proven divine, yet) is to disprove your religion is correct, or that is, the most or only correct.\n\n \n \nIt's a long passage. You've not answered the question I asked. But anyway.\n\n \n ::sigh:: I only object to the absolute statements of religious superiority and rightousness.... I don't necessarily object to any practices, though I don't really think them to be holy.\n \n \nYou show a distinct lack of understanding of Holy Tradition; your objections are very Protestant. Holy Tradition existed before the Bible. The books that made up the Bible had existed from quite early on. The Early church used Holy Tradition. It is that oral tradition that they used to help guide them in the selection\n Not all books that aren't in the Bible were rejected at all! Your ignorance, as I say, is very Protestant. The Didache isn't in the Bible, but used by my Church, the Epistles of St. Clement of Rome, and St. Ignatius of Antioch also. There's a whole raft of them. The Didache dates from c.150 and contains some things such as the practice of the Eucharist. Protestants reject this, because the Didache is not in the Bible. Your Bible-only argument needs to be re-worked.\n\n \n Okay, like I asked earlier, what are the criteria that determine which books are holy and which are heresy? Because I love some of the stuff in the Gospel of Thomas, yet, apparently, it's been \"disproven\" (how? I dunno....). I understand that Holy Tradition existed before the Bible. I also understand that each sect of early Christianity had their own traditions and practices. Do you swallow semen like the Gnostics? Probably not. Therefore, you must, before you go about accusing people of ignorance, clear up your ignorance. Somehow, there was a choice made that some books made up the official canonized Bible, that some practices were to be continued.... and on the flipside of that, someone also decided that some books and practices were immoral and heretical. What's the criteria? You seem to think the Bible and all documents of Jesus are holy, but the church disagrees. Maybe you need to practice that Gnostic ritual I mentioned.... it may clear up your thoughts a bit....\n \n \nThe Church lived for those hundreds of years between Jesus' resurrection and the compilation of the Bible. The later event didn't just suddenly occur. The Emperor didn't just wake up one day and say to the Church... \"How about puttin' a Bible together that makes me look good?\". There was commentary between bishops on early books. Already many had been condemned by the Church as being unholy. The church corresponded on hot issues of debate such as this.\n\n \n I never claimed the Bible was just spontaneously constructed. I know that there were early compilations and versions.... which is exactly what we were saying. There are great scriptures that aren't recognized as anything by the church.... basically, the point is that your views on Christianity are very limited to what the Roman Catholic Church (or the orthodox church, or whatever) has told you. The church decides for you what is integrated into your religion. You are a sheep following a man in a funny hat. He says god gave him authority, and you believe him. That's all.\n \n \nFirstly, Jesus didn't travel to Asia. He was already in it. But on these travel... you picked up this knowledge where? Why is it more trustworthy than the Bible? The rationale behind why you accept and reject evidences is to me unfathomable.\n\n \n Pardon me for not clarifying.... what I meant was greater Asia-India, the Orient. But isn't the Middle-East.... in.... Eur.... ope....???\n \n I've read several sources that have noted these travels, the only one coming to memory being The Book of Urantia. It's kinda crazy, but it's the only source I can name off the top of my head.\n \n The rationale, by the way, is that the teachings of Jesus are very Far Eastern.... if you actually look at them objectively. Jesus was not an obedient servant, rather someone who preached that with faith, you can move mountains. That's the beauty of Jesus, but no one who reads on Jesus really sees this.\n \n Sad.\n \n \nYou haven't provided evidence for your claims. You makes suppositions about what most people say or believe. You even talk about Jesus' mysterious travels and provide no evidence. And if you present a web-site, I can do as you did, say I visited it, but then say \"It provides no real evidence\".\n\n \n My evidence is the same stuff you have.... writings. My writings were also written by god. Therefore, my writings are just as valid. Read Urantia.... skip right to where it talks about Jesus.... the rest is fairly weird....\n \n \nAnd your point? The analogy you gave before was ludicrous. I'm sorry this has only just dawned on you. Now to the Jews. By you labelling a person a Jew, you've already established certain attributes with regard to faith. You would not need to poll them, because you've already established what they believe in! I'm sorry you've presented another Ubersuck of an analogy.\n\n \n By your definition, nothing compares to anything. You don't think analogies ever apply. Except when you make them.... like your cheese analogy.... great stuff....\n \n The fact is, Christianity is a religion that promotes ignorance. The Pope makes the basic decisions on belief, and everyone else just listens. So why do you think Christians have any idea about who compiled the Bible? Who the Popes were? What kind of men they were? What wars have been started in the name of god or Jesus? They know only what is told to them. Screw analogies.... the Christian mentality is that of pompous sheep, following their leader.\n \n \nIf you don't think Christianity is bad, then this is probably the only one area you disagree with Charchuk\n\n \n Okay, I'll rephrase: I don't think the basics of Christianity are bad. I like do unto others as you would have them do unto you. That's solid gold. The whole \"believe in Jesus or suffer in hell\" bit is a little too fascist for me. Christianity is not about being a good person alone, though.... you have to not reject Jesus to be a good Christian. You can still do bad, too! You just have to say sorry to Baby Jesus! Well, that is some XXXX, my friends. Love thy neighbor is what I like about Christianity.\n \n Note that just because I don't like most of Christianity doesn't mean it's necessarily bad.... but it's not right or the \"one true church\" or faith.\n \n \nYour faith in science shows your bias. What evidence is there already for extra-terrestrial life? If none, the go speak to the scientists at SETI. Scientists are flawed humans too, who like you and I work on a priori ideas. Otherwise you're suggesting that scientists just sit around waiting for something to be observed before they can act.... or do they actually hypothesise?\n\n \n Hypotheses are not fact. In science, you don't make statements without factual proof to back it up. You can make claims, but you must add the disclaimer \"this is a theory\". This is why evolution is called \"the theory of evolution\". But my faith in science is no bias, simply a yearning to be shown proof and evidence of claims.... such as Christianity and the Bible.\n \n Now, logic dictates that some things that are not completely proven true can be assumed. I can't prove that there's life on other planets, but given the vastness of the universe, I'd be arrogant to state otherwise. But the Bible doesn't work in the scope of the universe.... I mean, why, with the given that there were other lands, people, and faiths on the planet, did Jesus appear where he did? Why are the Jews god's chosen people? There's no logic to dictate this. But logic can dictate evolution.\n \n I do hypothesize.... but I won't ever claim truth unless I know for a fact. And given the lack of pro evidence and abundance of con evidence, I'd say that the \"one true church\" or faith claim is a big nix.\n \n \nDid you want me to present some of his statements?\n\n \n Nah, I'd rather read them fully.... you'd prolly leave out whole details that I could use against you. ;) \n \n \nYou missed the point - on purpose. He uses the one pronoun even when he's changed whom he refers to. It's hard to follow him when in the same paragraph he uses 'they' when 'they' can be two totally different people/groups.\n\n \n ::yawn:: Are we still arguing this point???\n \n \nI know you want to defend Charchuck, but again, you should not speak for him. It's one thing to agree with him, but to actually re-word his assertions as you now do is silly or dishonest.\n\n \n I don't reword anything he says.... quite honestly, you'd have to be a XXXXX not to understand what he's saying. Sorry to break it to you so harshly, but clearly, you don't want to believe him, so you won't even try to hear him.\n \n \nIt might seem so to you. I'll make it simple for you. That's like me saying Marxist Science, Christian Science, Evolutionary Science, Flat-earth Science are all the same, because they're all science. Get it?\n\n \n Yes, they are. I understand what I was saying. Science is science, religion is religion, culture is culture. Same melody, different lyrics. You catch on fast, don't ya....?!\n \n \nWhat a silly thing again to say. How do you know it was Magellan who wrote the documents, and not Mrs Smith from down the road? Your a priori reasoning rejects Jesus so therefore all evidence pointing to him is likewise rejected. You have no reason to doubt Magellan's existence, therefore all evidence of Magellan is admissible. All you are doing is showing the axioms to which you act.\n\n \n I don't know that he wrote the documents, but because other people recorded his writings, read his writings, personally knew him.... he existed. Granted, there could be a great big Magellan conspiracy from the government.... altering history books.... (I wouldn't put it past them) But as far as I'm concerned, enough credible witnesses could attest to his existence, and did, by speaking with him, writing about him, traveling with him, etc.\n \n Jesus probably existed, but so many contrasting documents about him are in circulation that it's tough to say whether or not \"Jesus\" isn't just a compilation of different people who rebelled against Rome back at the beginning of the Common Era. Even if Jesus did exist, who's to speak for the Bible's authors? Who were they? Scholars don't know for sure.... there's theories.... How can we prove they were god-inspired? How do we differentiate some authors as being \"holy\" from the authors of other documents? There are just too many questions that go unanswered.... you problem is you assume they actually have answers, since the church tells you these things as facts. You should do some unbiased investigation into your own faith.... be a doubting Thomas.... he was Jesus' most loved apostle, after all! ;) \n \n \nAlso, Catholics and Orthodox don't just have a singular document.\n\n \n For the most part, yes, they do. Any document not in the Bible is pretty much dismissed as scripture, save those few documents written by early Bishops.... which, just happen to be [i]re[i]interpretations of already existent writings. And even those documents are reinterpreted for you by the church leaders!!! With all the translations and reinterpretations of interpretations of Jesus, it's no wonder Christianity is like it is today!\n \n \nSo therefore we should blame all Marxist atheists.\n\n \n Maybe.... are they repeat offenders, or just the Christians?\n \n \nYes, I'm sure you can find a Greek equal to the Trinity, to Jesus being sent to save mankind.\n\n \n Your logic: Aristotle used scientific method to prove the world flat. Scientist use the same kind of methods. Therefore science is flawed.[/QUOTE]\n \n No, the interpretation of science is wrong. Not science....\n \n I think I've touched on this already.... is there an echo???\n \n \nNo, it would be true if one of the exclusive claims was actually true.\n\n \n You're hopeless. He's saying all religious claims are as equally without proof as any other. I am the Pink Swiss God. Charchuk is the Purple Swiss God. We are as equally silly for making such bold, authoritative statements, but as equally correct (i.e. both wrong and unprovable).\n \n \nAgain you want to put words into his mouth.\n\n \n As much as you suggest what Jesus meant, except incorrectly.",

   " Which is wrong. I don't just have the Bible. I told you, I'm an Orthodox Christian. But you deal with that later, so I will defer till then.\n\n \n \n I know that other books exist besides the Bible that influence Christianity.... but the fact is, you draw a distinguishing line between the Bible, and say, the Gospel of Thomas.\n\n \n Which Gospel of Thomas? Although none of them are accepted I'd just like you to define it because there's different reasons depending upon which Gospel of Thomas you're talking about.\n \n \nHow do you go about saying which documents are inspired and which are heresy? The only book Christians consistently call divine in grievance is the Bible.\n\n \n Huh? I just said 2,000 years of Church teachings says otherwise... we hold many books to be good. You're arguing from Protestant mentality again. Luther came along 1,500 years after the fact, disputes it, and you then argue that we're all inconsistent, and have been the whole 2,000 years. It's rather bizarre that a non-believer is actually giving credence to Protestant theories.\n \n \nNow, if you're allowed to pick and choose which books are holy and which aren't, why can't we non-Christians do the same? It's not that we're just attacking books randomly.... or is it? What criteria have you for determining the holiness of a work? My criterium (sic) is that there must be documented proof that god inspired the book in question. What...? No proof...?\n Well, there goes all your religious documentation.\n\n \n Again, Protestant thinking. Jesus commissioned his Apostles. He gave them the power of the Holy Spirit. He gave them the right to run the Church. Protestants don't believe this, and you agree with them! Funny that.\n \n \nAnd your criteria for judging which \"scientific\" statements are viable in this debate? Oh, you mean the Pope and/or other religious figures must've sanctioned them? I understand now....\n\n \n What part of me being Orthodox do you not understand? Actually the very fact you'd ask me to debate about the Pope in this way suggests strongly you've got bugger-all idea about Orthodoxy. Again a pro-Protestant debate. I should point out, I don't believe you're Protestant, but you've accepted them as normative of Christians. In a sense, it's like Satanists say that they don't believe in the Catholic Mass, but they say it, only backwards. So even though they reject it, they use it as the model; or the norm. You're doing the same thing, only you've no insight and little knowledge of Traditional Christianity and you're not even aware of this as you debate.\n \n [QUOTE=Montalban]And you said that 'they' as referred to by him was the Catholic Church. \n \n \nJust drop it. You're nitpicking on stupid words. He used all the correct pronouns.... as \"them\" and \"they\" pretty much describe all groups of people and/or organizations.\n\n \n No... He said he understood what 'they' meant about me. He obviously wasn't referring to Catholics. You've not understood the criticism I raise, but you're still willing to defend him. Within the one paragraph his use of a pronoun changed without him changing reference to which 'they' he's referring to. It's quite obvious 'they' didn't in this case mean the Catholic Church, but whom he meant, I don't know. You're being rather petty by defending the indefensible.\n \n \nShintos are a pluralist belief which I doubt you'd find any who say that the Bible hasn't any divine inspiration. Baha'i would accept the truth of the Bible as being divine. Jews and Muslims certainly do. Christians do, of course. The Dalai Lama does. In fact many eastern religions are so live and let live that they accept these things.\n\n \n \nThese facts are true.... but if you look into it, you've taken it all out of context. Eastern religions believe pretty much everything is divine. How nice to support your argument by only mentioning your books. The Jews and Muslims both think Jesus was a prophet, nothing more; so there goes your New Testament support, since Christianity depends on the belief of Jesus as Messiah and savior.\n I myself agree with the Eastern faiths.... the Bible is inspired, but so are the words I write now. Care to compare this post to the Bible next???\n\n \n No, not at all. Without really understanding what he was saying you've just leapt in to defend it, found it silly, then changed the focus to now talk about Jesus as Messiah, instead of divinely inspired that the Bible is. It's dishonest of you to keep moving the goalposts, but you're determined to score points.\n \n Orthodoxy is an Eastern faith. There are many eastern Christian faiths! You need to get out of the west once in a while. Even as a so called 'eastern' person you're still using western Christendom as a normative model; if only as the thing to which you reject.\n \n \nYour truism 'There are more Christians than non-Christians.' ...\n\n \n \nI believe the debate here is whether or not Christianity/Catholicism is the \"one true church\" (or faith).... ask Charchuk.... maybe you can get him on using \"they\" instead of \"Christians....\"\n\n \n Again another re-working on your part. It is true that is what the thread is about. But Charchuk tried a falsifiable test based on the fact that there are less Christians than non-Christians, and that all those non-Christians don't believe in the Bible. I know you're desperate by now to point score, but reworking things doesn't sit as being honest.\n \n \n But even here your maths argument is a nonsense\n\n \n \nPercentages don't mean anything, nor did I suggest they would (\"they\", by the way, refers to the percentages I just mentioned .I believe in evolution, but it has tons more evidence than Christians have of the divinity of the Bible. Please, prove me wrong by providing evidence that the Bible is god-inspired.\n\n \n Yet another re-working of the debate. It's on the same falsifiable test that he ran, not I! He was claiming the Bible is false because hardly anyone believes in it. You now recognise how silly it is but you're not willing to criticise your ally Charchuk for raising a lame argument in the first place.\n \n \nUnless, you're still arguing on the change of focus you made, which Charchuk did not. Islam doesn't just 'respect' the Bible. It's a nice shift of emphasis of yours, but it doesn't work. The Baha'i, and Jews also don't just 'respect' the Bible.\n\n \n \nIt rejects the notion that Christ was the messiah. Muslims use the Koran, if I'm not mistaken, as their holy text. Jews use the Old Testament. Since the whole damn point of the New Testament is to show that Jesus was the messiah?and these three faiths you mentioned don't agree with it?I think it's fairly safe to say that they \"reject\" the New Testament (or at least its ideals, proving that there are more non-Christians than Christians).\n\n \n Ah, so you are using the Charchuk test on what's false. I wish you'd make up your mind. A moment ago you said percentages were a time waster. You're argument is now that the New Testament is a nonsense based on the absolute figures of people who don't believe in it. In that case I refer to you to my counter about Evolution - that it was at one stage a minority 'faith' therefore false, by your maths test of truth. You are arguing based on demographics.\n \n You're acting a wee bit like Charchuk on this. I thought that only he could issue two actually opposite arguments on the same post and still smile as if nothing were wrong.\n \n \nYou can't compare the two. 2,000 years of glory, art, music, literature and belief - even if you think it's all flawed, is nothing compared to the War in Iraq. It's absolutely ridiculous for you to go into bat on this one.\n\n \n \nIt's the same idea.... believing the truth of something?be it a cause, a document, a person (or all of the above)?and basically putting lives on the line for that, whether those lives be on the side of \"good\" or \"evil\". In war, one person believes they're so correct, they'll kill for it. Likewise with Christianity.... especially with the historic events of the Crusades, the Witch Trials, the constant havoc wreaked during the first century of Christianity's existence.\n How ridiculous is it really?\n\n \n In absolute terms, if we're talking about all truths being tested, you might have a case. We're not though. At least I am not and neither is Charchuk (as far as I can tell). No great good has come from the war. Some (or lots, if you're on my side) has from Christianity, therefore they are incomparable. Something with goodness, to something with no goodness.\n \n But your argument is getting ridiculous. Your fundamental lack of knowledge on history is demonstrated in your second last sentence. How could Christianity have wreaked havoc in it's first century of existence? It is laughable that you are so pent up with hate for such a fine religion that you'd blame it for evils, even when it was a minority religion under severe persecution.\n \n \n Fair enough. Hitler used science to justify the extermination of the lesser races. By your logic, I will now blame science for this, as there must be something in science that allows for this sort of thing.\n\n \n \nScience is not a group of people. Science is a method, and the way those methods are put into use is the equivalent of how people interpret the Bible.... which basically speaks of a method of living.\n You can blame Hitler's twist on science?you can blame the Nazis and their propaganda?but you can't blame science itself.\n Just as such, I can blame Christianity's twist on scriptures?I can blame the Christians and their propaganda?but I can't blame the Bible or Jesus.\n\n \n Neither is Christianity. I'm sorry that you can't see the difference between an idea (Science/Christianity) with the believers. That's why your criticism's so lame. One moment your arguing about the people - Christians, next about the faith. Thus if you're going to say Christianity is the same as the War on Iraq, then I can use another idea, science.\n \n \nYou've effectively dismissed the whole site with your last sentence. I have provided evidence. You reject it. I will do no more on this account. It is for others reading this engagement who are more open-minded to decide.\n\n \n \nYou have provided nothing! Those images were hardly any \"hidden\" pictures of Jesus or a family. My fianc\u00e9e was passing by and without informing her as to what she was looking for, I asked her if she saw an image within the eye of the statue. She saw nothing. I went to other sites about your \"evidence\"?ones that did not highlight the areas where the suggested images are supposed to be.... and well, I was less than convinced. Funny, the site I went to was Christian as well, but curiously, without the suggestion and outline of what I was supposed to be seeing, there was nothing but a statue's eye. Seeing images within holy statues and paintings won't convince me, since these things are coincidence. When you want to believe something, I guess you'll make a mountain out of a molehill.\n\n \n There were more than just 'images' But you missed them. You are blinded by hate. There were at least 10 link pages from the page I gave. By belittling it with such a minor off-hand statement it shows how much you actually looked at it; but then you weren't really prepared to, because your a priori beliefs is that it's all false anyway. Its circular reasoning there, but you can't see it.\n \n \nAs someone clearly stated in a previous post, heathens do not believe in gods.... at least not in the traditional sense.... it's humorous that you use comments made in jest to try and win the argument.... since you have no argument, gotta pin me with whatever you can, eh? \n\n \n Sorry, then that makes not just you who is wrong. Heathen comes from 'heath' because the people who believed in gods had to go worship in the heath as they were unwelcome in Church. Sorry if I point out your glaring errors. How silly of me to do so in a debate. I'll try not to argue against your points next to you debate, maybe that would suit you better.\n \n \nYou show a distinct lack of understanding of Holy Tradition; your objections are very Protestant. Holy Tradition existed before the Bible. The books that made up the Bible had existed from quite early on. The Early church used Holy Tradition. It is that oral tradition that they used to help guide them in the selection...\n\n \n \nOkay, like I asked earlier, what are the criteria that determine which books are holy and which are heresy? Because I love some of the stuff in the Gospel of Thomas, yet, apparently, it's been \"disproven\" (how? I dunno....). I understand that Holy Tradition existed before the Bible. I also understand that each sect of early Christianity had their own traditions and practices. Do you swallow semen like the Gnostics? Probably not. Therefore, you must, before you go about accusing people of ignorance, clear up your ignorance. Somehow, there was a choice made that some books made up the official canonized Bible, that some practices were to be continued.... and on the flipside of that, someone also decided that some books and practices were immoral and heretical. What's the criteria? You seem to think the Bible and all documents of Jesus are holy, but the church disagrees. Maybe you need to practice that Gnostic ritual I mentioned.... it may clear up your thoughts a bit....\n\n \n It just shows your ignorance of Holy Tradition, despite your claim. Again you're trying this numbers falsifiable test, that because some people disagree, the whole things a wank.\n \n But your ignorance comes into play because you don't know that at the beginning there was only one church. There weren't many! Even when there was debate and disagreement, there was one Church. Later on as some things were canonised, some people who were in disagreement stayed with the Church, some left.\n \n You've got this quasi-conspiracy thing too, with the Gnostics. They were never one group who were like the holders of an alternative truth. Anyone who read something about Jesus and came up with their own ideas, like you have done, would have been termed a Gnostic. Holy Tradition was constant. If some desert dweller had a revelation that went against Holy Tradition, he was a Gnostic, because he relied on his own knowledge (that's where the word comes from). Your argument would be, okay, despite that Holy Tradition has been constant, because I've heard some desert dude has a revelation that is different, then Holy Tradition is a sham.\n \n If you look at the books of Acts, only some people were given the power, by the Holy Spirit, to interpret. They passed this down through Apostolic Succession, it still lives within the Church. Someone, from outside that circle who claims to have direct revelation is rejected by Holy Tradition; because Holy Tradition argues that such revelations are not the way truth is revealed. Again you are arguing from a Protestant normative perspective.\n \n \nThe Church lived for those hundreds of years between Jesus' resurrection and the compilation of the Bible...\n\n \n \nI never claimed the Bible was just spontaneously constructed. I know that there were early compilations and versions.... which is exactly what we were saying. There are great scriptures that aren't recognized as anything by the church.... basically, the point is that your views on Christianity are very limited to what the Roman Catholic Church (or the orthodox church, or whatever) has told you. The church decides for you what is integrated into your religion. You are a sheep following a man in a funny hat. He says god gave him authority, and you believe him. That's all.\n\n \n How do you know that there were earlier Bibles? Gnosticism? Show me the proof.\n \n It is laughable that you don't know the difference between Orthodoxy and Catholicism, but have the hide to debate on the issue. Shows you're an American, always has an opinion, even if you have no knowledge.\n \n \nFirstly, Jesus didn't travel to Asia. He was already in it. But on these travel... you picked up this knowledge where? Why is it more trustworthy than the Bible? The rationale behind why you accept and reject evidences is to me unfathomable.\n\n \n \nPardon me for not clarifying.... what I meant was greater Asia?India, the Orient. But isn't the Middle-East.... in.... Eur.... ope....???\n I've read several sources that have noted these travels, the only one coming to memory being The Book of Urantia. It's kinda crazy, but it's the only source I can name off the top of my head.\n The rationale, by the way, is that the teachings of Jesus are very Far Eastern.... if you actually look at them objectively. Jesus was not an obedient servant, rather someone who preached that with faith, you can move mountains. That's the beauty of Jesus, but no one who reads on Jesus really sees this.\n\n \n They are not 'far eastern' again your occidental quasi Protestant perspective is shinning through. The Orthodox Church is the church of the East! If you only knew something about it! But still, again your bias is showing. You quite happily lampoon Christianity because of Gnostic sources, and quite happily accept one that suggest Christ went east.\n \n \n You haven't provided evidence for your claims. You makes suppositions about what most people say or believe. You even talk about Jesus' mysterious travels and provide no evidence. And if you present a web-site, I can do as you did, say I visited it, but then say \"It provides no real evidence\".\n\n \n \nMy evidence is the same stuff you have.... writings. My writings were also written by god. Therefore, my writings are just as valid. Read Urantia.... skip right to where it talks about Jesus.... the rest is fairly weird....\n\n \n What a cute cop-out\n \n \nAnd your point? The analogy you gave before was ludicrous. I'm sorry this has only just dawned on you. Now to the Jews. By you labelling a person a Jew, you've already established certain attributes with regard to faith. You would not need to poll them, because you've already established what they believe in! I'm sorry you've presented another Ubersuck of an analogy.\n\n \n \nBy your definition, nothing compares to anything. You don't think analogies ever apply. Except when you make them.... like your cheese analogy.... great stuff....\n The fact is, Christianity is a religion that promotes ignorance. The Pope makes the basic decisions on belief, and everyone else just listens. So why do you think Christians have any idea about who compiled the Bible? Who the Popes were? What kind of men they were? What wars have been started in the name of god or Jesus? They know only what is told to them. Screw analogies.... the Christian mentality is that of pompous sheep, following their leader.\n\n \n No, you just make silly analogies, and you can't admit it. You argue when\n a) you don't know anything about Orthodoxy, and therefore lack a true understanding about Holy Tradition\n b) you don't present facts, even when challenged you XXXXX-foot around with attempted sarcasm\n c) you don't know that there's a wealth of Christianity that's beyond the western model you know of\n d) you defend Charchuk even when he's so patently loony statements would make most people blush\n e) you use even more of the lamest analogies\n \n Again, with the Pope. Even the most tiny modicum of knowledge about Orthodoxy would show how screwy your argument is. Go have a look and then come back and apologise for trying to get me to defend someone I don't follow! Wow, has that occurred to you yet? Again this is a Protestant thing. Get back to me when you know what you're arguing about unless you enjoy painting yourself a fool. The Orthodox Church is the one true Church.",

   "Before, I comment on your rather ignorant and dodgy post.... a few notes to keep in mind....\n \n 1) I'm not Protestant. I'm not a Christian. Nor am I an atheist. I claim no religion, and so, my views are a compilation of all the things I've ever agreed with. I have no biases, other than a desire to prove things (or at least have enough evidence to provide a reasonable, rational, logical theory). Because I want solid evidence, the following things don't prove your point or points:\n \n a) The Bible or other scriptures\n \n You can't prove godly-inspiration. And because your distinction between holy texts and heretical texts depends on being able to determine this, your Bible and/or other documents are about as reliable as any normal book based on history (like a historical romance novel, for instance).\n \n b) The authority of a church leader\n \n You're Orthodox, right? Y'all still have leaders, right? Someone who acts as the \"intermediary between god's word and the people of god\"? Well, unless you can prove they have been given god-granted authority, power of the holy spirit, or other such amazing abilities to make rules (which you can't), church leaders are about as reliable as any person who can make decisions with their own brain (like an atheist stripper, for instance).\n \n c) Christian-run organizations, publications, and/or wesbites\n \n Members of a large group of people stick together, especially when the group is built upon a strict set of rules, beliefs, and dogmas. Because the aforementioned groups and/or group sanctioned documents must follow adhere to rules, beliefs, and dogmas, and the people involved must also adhere to there rules, beliefs, and dogmas, an objective point of view is never explored. Because all groups run by Christians (or Nazis or master bakers) are unobjective, the things that sprout from them are unreliable.\n \n And while you'll jump the gun and assume that anything non-Christian is against Christianity, you are mistaken. Science, if it supports Christianity, will not hide the fact. Now, if an atheist were to direct you to some ihategod-dot-com.... then you may have a case.\n \n 2) Because of my own personal imperfections paired with my growing frustrations with closed-minded people, I am beginning to spout insults in jest. It's sort of arrogant, but hey.... when in Rome, do as the Roman Catholics do. See what I mean? It doesn't help your case to pick apart statements like that. I know you're not Roman Catholic, but no, it doesn't mean I'm totally ignorant to the ways of the Orthodox sect. I grow weary of such nitpicking and stupid arguing. Please, stick to the topic, which is: \"ONE TRUE CHURCH\".\n \n 3) I argue several things, but they all go back to my major point. I may in one sentence say that Jesus isn't the Messiah. In the next, I'll state that just because the Pope makes claims, it doesn't give him any proven god-given authority. In the next, I'll talk about how Dubya's war is much like the Pope's church. Later, I'll argue that the Bible is unreliable. I know that you aren't capable of keeping up with my multi-tasking debate powers, but guess what? All of these things are related! How, you ask? They all go to prove one point: that the \"ONE TRUE CHURCH\" isn't the \"ONE TRUE CHURCH\". And just because I'm not arguing about your specific denomination of the Christian web doesn't mean my points are any less credible.... I mean, if you notice, this isn't the \"ORTHODOX OR ORNARY: YOU DECIDE...\" thread....\n \n ~~~\n \n Now, with that taken care of, let's break-down your moronic debating skills one-by-one:\n \n \n \nWhich Gospel of Thomas? Although none of them are accepted I'd just like you to define it because there's different reasons depending upon which Gospel of Thomas you're talking about.\n\n \n It doesn't matter. The question is quite redundant (so, please, don't beg for an answer like a child who wants desperately to think they've won a point). How do I know your criteria are valid? Can they be scientifically proven??? This is my basic qualm: if your criteria could be debated by other Christians, how do you know you're right? And if you don't know you're right about the validity of texts, how can you prove your belief system isn't a myth?\n \n \nHuh? I just said 2,000 years of Church teachings says otherwise... we hold many books to be good. You're arguing from Protestant mentality again. Luther came along 1,500 years after the fact, disputes it, and you then argue that we're all inconsistent, and have been the whole 2,000 years. It's rather bizarre that a non-believer is actually giving credence to Protestant theories.\n\n \n BUT SOME ARE CALLED HERESIES. Obviously, if someone wrote those books, they (the writer) didn't think they were bad. So, this all goes back to my point: if your criteria could be debated by other Christians, how do you know you're right? And if you don't know you're right about the validity of texts, how can you prove your belief system isn't a myth?\n \n \nAgain, Protestant thinking. Jesus commissioned his Apostles. He gave them the power of the Holy Spirit. He gave them the right to run the Church. Protestants don't believe this, and you agree with them! Funny that.\n\n \n Prove the holy spirit. Prove that Jesus actually comissioned his Apostles. Prove any of your statements, and you automatically win the argument!\n \n Why are the Protestants so bad anyway? Because they question what lacks evidence? Why should anyone believe what you state? Answer me that....\n \n \nWhat part of me being Orthodox do you not understand? Actually the very fact you'd ask me to debate about the Pope in this way suggests strongly you've got bugger-all idea about Orthodoxy. Again a pro-Protestant debate. I should point out, I don't believe you're Protestant, but you've accepted them as normative of Christians. In a sense, it's like Satanists say that they don't believe in the Catholic Mass, but they say it, only backwards. So even though they reject it, they use it as the model; or the norm. You're doing the same thing, only you've no insight and little knowledge of Traditional Christianity and you're not even aware of this as you debate.\n\n \n Actually, I know nothing but the basics of Protestantism, but loads and heaps about Catholicism.... I was, after all, raised a Catholic boy. Protestantism discredits me in the eyes of all your buddies, it must. Or else you'd stop with your childish methods of labeling. You know, Protestants are on quite level footing with all religions and denominations. Yep.... they're the equals of Catholics, Episcopals, and Orthodox Christians, as well as with Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, Mormons, Muslims.... etc.\n \n But I'm not arguing about the specifics of any denomination. This thread is about Catholicism, but it applies to all Christianity. So shut up with your bickering.\n \n \nNo... He said he understood what 'they' meant about me. He obviously wasn't referring to Catholics. You've not understood the criticism I raise, but you're still willing to defend him. Within the one paragraph his use of a pronoun changed without him changing reference to which 'they' he's referring to. It's quite obvious 'they' didn't in this case mean the Catholic Church, but whom he meant, I don't know. You're being rather petty by defending the indefensible.\n\n \n If the indefensible is petty, my friend, you are the glorious king. So, again, shut up.\n \n \nNo, not at all. Without really understanding what he was saying you've just leapt in to defend it, found it silly, then changed the focus to now talk about Jesus as Messiah, instead of divinely inspired that the Bible is. It's dishonest of you to keep moving the goalposts, but you're determined to score points.\n\n \n If there is one main idea I must follow in order to belong to a religion, and I don't believe in that idea, I am not a member of said religion. So, whether it be the divinity of the Bible, the reliability of religious leaders, or the Messiah-ness (I know, I invented the word) of Jesus, the point is that most of the world would disagree with one or all of the above.\n \n More in depth, if the core of the Christian Bible is the New Testament-which basically depicts Jesus as being the Messiah-and I don't believe that Jesus was the Messiah, I reject the core of the Christian Bible. Maybe other faiths still call the Bible \"inspired\", but they don't revere the book as much as you do, and certainly, they don't belong to your faith. They reject your core belief, and so, in effect, reject your religion. They don't hate you or anything, they just don't believe you're correct.\n \n \nOrthodoxy is an Eastern faith. There are many eastern Christian faiths! You need to get out of the west once in a while. Even as a so called 'eastern' person you're still using western Christendom as a normative model; if only as the thing to which you reject.\n\n \n ::sigh:: When I say Eastern faiths or Far Eastern faiths, I don't mean Orthodox Christianity, no matter what you want to think. I am talking about Hindu, Jainism, Buddhism, Shintoism, and other such \"naturalist\" faiths. And please don't start arguing about my use of the word naturalist.... that's not the point of this debate!!!!\n \n \nAgain another re-working on your part. It is true that is what the thread is about. But Charchuk tried a falsifiable test based on the fact that there are less Christians than non-Christians, and that all those non-Christians don't believe in the Bible. I know you're desperate by now to point score, but reworking things doesn't sit as being honest.\n\n \n There are less Christians than non-Christians. And non-Christians don't believe in the Christian Bible. It's a proven fact. Get over it.\n \n Non-Christians don't worship Jesus. Thus, they don't fully agree with your interpretation of the Bible. Obviously, if you Christians claim there's only one true way to interpret the Bible, they would seem to reject that interpretation, and hence, your Bible and belief system.\n \n I try to follow Jesus' golden rule.... I think the Bible was divinely inspired (I think all things are divine).... and I don't mind different belief systems. Do I reject Jesus as Messiah and the Bible as god's word? Yes.\n \n \nYet another re-working of the debate. It's on the same falsifiable test that he ran, not I! He was claiming the Bible is false because hardly anyone believes in it. You now recognise how silly it is but you're not willing to criticise your ally Charchuk for raising a lame argument in the first place.\n\n \n You need to learn how to read for context. He didn't at all claim that just because most people don't believe in it, it's false. XXXXX.\n \n \nAh, so you are using the Charchuk test on what's false. I wish you'd make up your mind. A moment ago you said percentages were a time waster. You're argument is now that the New Testament is a nonsense based on the absolute figures of people who don't believe in it. In that case I refer to you to my counter about Evolution - that it was at one stage a minority 'faith' therefore false, by your maths test of truth. You are arguing based on demographics.\n \n You're acting a wee bit like Charchuk on this. I thought that only he could issue two actually opposite arguments on the same post and still smile as if nothing were wrong.\n\n \n Look, by logic, god could not just choose one small patch of people on earth and give them the true religion. It doesn't make sense. Our point is not that it's automatically false because it's a minority belief, just that it doesn't logically make as much sense as, say, Buddhism. I mean, how do you know you're right? Unless you know of every other faith, try it, and reject it, you can't know for sure. Your faith and the faith of all Christians is the only argument you have, but what is that faith built on? Trial and error, or arrogance? Which is more scientific?\n \n \nIn absolute terms, if we're talking about all truths being tested, you might have a case. We're not though. At least I am not and neither is Charchuk (as far as I can tell). No great good has come from the war. Some (or lots, if you're on my side) has from Christianity, therefore they are incomparable. Something with goodness, to something with no goodness.\n \n But your argument is getting ridiculous. Your fundamental lack of knowledge on history is demonstrated in your second last sentence. How could Christianity have wreaked havoc in it's first century of existence? It is laughable that you are so pent up with hate for such a fine religion that you'd blame it for evils, even when it was a minority religion under severe persecution.\n\n \n All things are related. War and organized religion both have a cause that I (and many others) believe to be flawed, so they can be compared. Quit trying to discredit by dodging the line of debate.\n \n In the first century, Christians were a warring people. They fought each other. They committed crimes, brother against brother, and not to mention, yes, they were persecuted by the Romans, like all other non-Roman belief systems. It was indeed a minority religion, and still is, but this status doesn't mean there wasn't and isn't great amounts of turmoil between its people and ideas.\n \n And by the way, let's not throw opinion statements into arguments.... \"such a fine religion\".... yeah, whatever you say, man....\n \n \nNeither is Christianity. I'm sorry that you can't see the difference between an idea (Science/Christianity) with the believers. That's why your criticism's so lame. One moment your arguing about the people - Christians, next about the faith. Thus if you're going to say Christianity is the same as the War on Iraq, then I can use another idea, science.\n\n \n Text can be interpreted in any way, shape, or form that the reader decides. When someone does so and acts upon his interpretations, it's not the text's fault-it becomes the person's fault. Marx had nothing to do with the Korean War. The Bible had nothing to do with the Crusades. Yet, the people who believe in a certain interpretation of each document did unspeakable things. So, while I don't blame the Bible, I blame Christians who interpret the Bible in their singular way, and collectively form the religion of Christianity.\n \n Science is equivalent to the Bible, by the way; it's just something for men to interpret. You can diss science all you want, but you Christians manipulate science to prove your own points. Where'll you be, then?\n \n \nThere were more than just 'images' But you missed them. You are blinded by hate. There were at least 10 link pages from the page I gave. By belittling it with such a minor off-hand statement it shows how much you actually looked at it; but then you weren't really prepared to, because your a priori beliefs is that it's all false anyway. Its circular reasoning there, but you can't see it.\n\n \n You can't get mad because I don't see a Magic Eye picture. Unless you can prove it's actually there, it's not. With a Magic Eye picture, at least the artist could show me the process he went through to hide the intended image within the seemingly abstract art. This would show irrefutably that the image existed within the Magic Eye picture. Can you do this for me with your \"miracle\"? No? Then your evidence is biased and subjective. NEXT.....!\n \n \nSorry, then that makes not just you who is wrong. Heathen comes from 'heath' because the people who believed in gods had to go worship in the heath as they were unwelcome in Church. Sorry if I point out your glaring errors. How silly of me to do so in a debate. I'll try not to argue against your points next to you debate, maybe that would suit you better.\n\n \n When I made my humorous quip regarding the rise and takeover of the heathens, I didn't research the word. My apologies. Next time, when I'm being facetious, I'll make sure to include a bibliography so you can't sidetrack the argument.\n \n \nIt just shows your ignorance of Holy Tradition, despite your claim. Again you're trying this numbers falsifiable test, that because some people disagree, the whole things a wank.\n \n But your ignorance comes into play because you don't know that at the beginning there was only one church. There weren't many! Even when there was debate and disagreement, there was one Church. Later on as some things were canonised, some people who were in disagreement stayed with the Church, some left.\n \n You've got this quasi-conspiracy thing too, with the Gnostics. They were never one group who were like the holders of an alternative truth. Anyone who read something about Jesus and came up with their own ideas, like you have done, would have been termed a Gnostic. Holy Tradition was constant. If some desert dweller had a revelation that went against Holy Tradition, he was a Gnostic, because he relied on his own knowledge (that's where the word comes from). Your argument would be, okay, despite that Holy Tradition has been constant, because I've heard some desert dude has a revelation that is different, then Holy Tradition is a sham.\n \n If you look at the books of Acts, only some people were given the power, by the Holy Spirit, to interpret. They passed this down through Apostolic Succession, it still lives within the Church. Someone, from outside that circle who claims to have direct revelation is rejected by Holy Tradition; because Holy Tradition argues that such revelations are not the way truth is revealed. Again you are arguing from a Protestant normative perspective.\n\n \n No, there was not \"one church\". Some sects had \"heretical\" ideas.... are they a part of your church nowaday? They all called themselves Christians because of the influence of Christ, but they were in fact many different churches with different beliefs, or at least different versions of those beliefs. Is the orthodox church the same as the Catholic church? No? I thought you said there was only one!\n \n Only when Constantine made Christianity the state religion did there become an \"official\" church, and even then, rouge Christian sects still ran around doing whatever they did.... argue.... battle.... kill each other.... etc.\n \n And, oh, Gnostic.... argue my use of words, my friend.... 'tis the only point you can possibly gain ground on!\n \n Now, does your church initiate young boys by taking them naked into gardens....? Do you swallow semen to fill your body with its sacred power? Oh, you mean the Gnostics were the only ones who followed that holy tradition, proving that the tradition has changed over time? Or wait, did the \"church\" decide which traditions are holy? Cuz if it's the authority of god that allows them to determine which are holy, then the holiness of said traditions is in question.... I mean, can you prove this authority? So, which way do you want to lose.....?\n \n If holy tradition has changed-being as you don't swallow the precious nectar at mass-then I'd say you need to revoke all statements about how constant \"holy tradition\" has been and all arguments based on that assumed fact.\n \n If tradition is only holy if the holy spirit gives someone the power to interpret as so, then you're done. Prove that the holy spirit gave someone the power to deem something a holy tradition. Can you? Yeah, didn't think so, XXXXX.\n \n \nHow do you know that there were earlier Bibles? Gnosticism? Show me the proof.\n \n It is laughable that you don't know the difference between Orthodoxy and Catholicism, but have the hide to debate on the issue. Shows you're an American, always has an opinion, even if you have no knowledge.\n\n \n ::sigh:: Are you finished bitching? Want to get back to the debate?\n \n The Bible you read today is NOT the same Bible as was conceived back in the early history of the church. I can't name specific references, since I kinda understood this as common knowledge (I mean, you know that the Bible was put together and didn't just magically appear, right?).... books were added, books were subtracted..... XXXXX.\n \n \nThey are not 'far eastern' again your occidental quasi Protestant perspective is shinning through. The Orthodox Church is the church of the East! If you only knew something about it! But still, again your bias is showing. You quite happily lampoon Christianity because of Gnostic sources, and quite happily accept one that suggest Christ went east.\n\n \n Christianity is not the only religion. So shut up.\n \n \nWhat a cute cop-out\n\n \n What's copping out? I gave you a book to read.... hop to it, XXXXX.\n \n \nNo, you just make silly analogies, and you can't admit it. You argue when\n a) you don't know anything about Orthodoxy, and therefore lack a true understanding about Holy Tradition\n b) you don't present facts, even when challenged you XXXXX-foot around with attempted sarcasm\n c) you don't know that there's a wealth of Christianity that's beyond the western model you know of\n d) you defend Charchuk even when he's so patently loony statements would make most people blush\n e) you use even more of the lamest analogies\n\n \n ::yawn:: Want to start debating the points again? Or are you going to complain because I'm not intimate with all knowledge of all things? Let's face it: even if I presented you with a handwritten statement from god himself, you wouldn't believe me. You'll only believe what you want to. If you presented me with something more than an opinion or faith.... maybe something tangible.... you'd get my full attention. That's the difference between you and I..... I'm open-minded, if there's evidence.... and you're a Christian.\n \n \nAgain, with the Pope. Even the most tiny modicum of knowledge about Orthodoxy would show how screwy your argument is. Go have a look and then come back and apologise for trying to get me to defend someone I don't follow! Wow, has that occurred to you yet? Again this is a Protestant thing. Get back to me when you know what you're arguing about unless you enjoy painting yourself a fool. The Orthodox Church is the one true Church.\n\n \n No, your church is not the one true church. XXXXX..... so shut up. ;) \n \n \n And by the way, here's a statement directly from God, sanctioned by the holy spirit:\n \n \"XXXXXXmit! You people are such whiny bitches! Live life! Don't judge.... just live and let live! Did I mention that there is no true church....? KillaCozzy has been given authority to spread the truth to the people. Thank you. And eat fresh.\"\n \n You heard it from God, folks.... and so, that concludes my argument. God just said I was correct, so I win.\n \n \n \n Holla!!!",

   " Before, I comment on your rather ignorant and dodgy post.... a few notes to keep in mind....\n 1) I'm not Protestant. I'm not a Christian. Nor am I an atheist. I claim no religion, and so, my views are a compilation of all the things I've ever agreed with. I have no biases, other than a desire to prove things (or at least have enough evidence to provide a reasonable, rational, logical theory). Because I want solid evidence, the following things don't prove your point or points:\n \n \n I never said you were. I said you are arguing from a Protestant perspective. Big difference. You don't know what you're debating. When you debate Holy Tradition as practiced by the Roman Catholic Church (the subject of this thread), or the Orthodox Church (my Church) you need to understand Holy Tradition as we see it, not as Protestants do.\n \n You have acquired the western-centric Protestant bible-only Christian view as normative of all Christianity, and you are arguing against that. You're not even picking the right target, because as I said, neither the subject of this thread, nor the Orthodox Church are Bible-only.\n \n The difference between what I claim and what you think I claim are not so subtle that an educated person might pick up.\n \n You then pathetically claim that you understand Holy Tradition then cite examples such as Thomas which show the exact opposite of what you just claimed; a knowledge of Holy Tradition.\n \n So, I'm going to try to explain it.\n \n Jesus' mission was here on earth for 3 years. In that time He gathered a great many followers. Only 12 were selected as His inner circle. At the end of the Gospel of John, the Evangelist says that of all the things done by Jesus, if they were all written down, they'd be able perhaps to fill all the books then existing; ie. not everything Jesus did was written down.\n \n Equally important was that Jesus gave a commission to His 12 to teach in His name. He did this because otherwise any idiot with half a brain could claim to have known Jesus and distort the truth.\n \n Things were taught by these men to others (except Judas who had killed himself). Books were written and discussed. Early students of the Apostles were Clement of Rome and Ignatius of Antioch. They in turn passed the grade as far as learning and understanding and their own Epistles were well circulated.\n \n Eventually there were people producing gospels that went against this Holy Tradition. For instance, if it had already been taught that Jesus was just and divine, then if a book turns up, such as what we now refer to as Infancy Gospel of Thomas - A, which teaches that Jesus as a child used His holy powers to wreak havoc on His school teachers and friends, then we can conclude that this book is not 'inspired' as Holy Tradition is the rule of thumb, and this quite clearly goes against what has always been taught.\n \n Books were written by Origen, Tertullian, Ireaneus, Clement, Ignatius etc, all discussing Christian issues. When the Church decided to bring together a number of books to call 'the Bible' they did not say that Clement's book was not inspired... so a Bible-only argument as you had been using is a nonsense, unless you're a Protestant, because they only believe in the Bible.\n \n The Bible was established as kind of a summation of things. But, the Church that put it together never said that this is the end. We Orthodox continue to have writers and commentators.\n \n Jesus established a Church, a living framework, with Holy Orders, and so forth. Anyone who wanted to interpret the Bible for themselves was harshly rebuked. Because you could use passages of the Bible to suit any and all purposes, a fact which you recognise. We are taught by Bishops, who themselves were taught by Bishops. My Bishop can trace this lineage (or Apostolic Succession) all the way back to St Peter - who himself was taught by Jesus. If I suddenly raise my hand and say, \"No, I think I've got the definitive answer\" this too is against Holy Tradition.\n \n If any of them were to declare \"Jesus was not divine\" we would use Holy Tradition as a judge - have we always taught this? No! Therefore it is not inspired.\n \n Now to your asinine use of the Gnostics. Using them as a whole is itself absurd as there was never a 'Gnostic' church or a 'Gnostic' dogma. There were many. Gnostics tried to claim that they had secret knowledge of Jesus. Again, we look to Holy Tradition. Does their revelation fall in line with how accepted revelation has occurred? Sometimes, yes. Sometimes, no. Some people claiming special knowledge were within the framework of the ministers of the Church. Those who weren't can be off-handedly rejected because Jesus had established the way revelations would work - through His Church.\n \n Of those who, like Arian, and Pelagius who were ordained ministers we have Ecumenical Councils, that is a gathering of members of all the Church to debate the issues. Arianism was rejected as being inconsistent with Holy Tradition. The ruling of the Council then had to be accepted by the people (at least in so far as Orthodoxy).\n \n Your falsification theory is so flawed because you find someone who wrote the opposite of the Bible; a Gnostic. Therefore, he must be correct, and the framework established by Jesus must be flawed.\n \n It's ludicrous.\n \n You are American. The Constitution enshrines principles but it is not the whole of your law. Just as the Bible is not the whole of our knowledge of Jesus, but it is, like the Constitution, central. You have educated and specialist people to interpret the words. They write on issues of law. The tests go through a set procedure. No idiot pops up says \"The right to own slaves is protected by a secret meaning to the Constitution that everyone has missed\" and then you accept his theory as true.\n \n You are so dead-set on pulling down Christianity. Whether you're arguing against me, as an Orthodox, of Catholics, you've completely missed the mark by arguing against a system of belief that is practiced by Protestants.\n \n \n b) The authority of a church leader\n You're Orthodox, right? Y'all still have leaders, right? Someone who acts as the \"intermediary between god's word and the people of god\"? Well, unless you can prove they have been given god-granted authority, power of the holy spirit, or other such amazing abilities to make rules (which you can't), church leaders are about as reliable as any person who can make decisions with their own brain (like an atheist stripper, for instance).\n \n \n Nice try, but showing your ignorance of Orthodoxy only helps make you look laughable. To be doctrine in Orthodoxy it has to be passed by a council of bishops, it is true. We don't have a single leader, a Pope. It would be handy for you to know this. But, then it has to be accepted by the people. And the people can and have rejected what a council has found, such as in the iconoclast controversy c.800. And the filioque controversy c.1450.\n \n I beg you to actually find out about what you're arguing against. But hey, as I said, you're an American. If you stand around shouting your opinion loud enough, it makes you feel like you're somebody.\n \n \n\n c) Christian-run organizations, publications, and/or wesbites\n Members of a large group of people stick together, especially when the group is built upon a strict set of rules, beliefs, and dogmas. Because the aforementioned groups and/or group sanctioned documents must follow adhere to rules, beliefs, and dogmas, and the people involved must also adhere to there rules, beliefs, and dogmas, an objective point of view is never explored. Because all groups run by Christians (or Nazis or master bakers) are unobjective, the things that sprout from them are unreliable.\n \n \n Yet you prefer to believe the minority, such as gnostics. You believe that Jesus travelled 'to Asia' based on no fact. Yet you're quite prepared to spout garbage like the above.\n \n Really, you need to read-up on Orthodoxy. The only saving grace for you is a large number of the people reading this are equally uneducated about Orthodoxy, and probably think your words ring true.\n \n Orthodoxy is very undogmatic. It is a church that prides itself on mystery. We are, after-all, an Eastern Church. Whereas the Catholic Church will be legalistic and try to define everything ad infinitum, many times the Orthodox Church will say \"We don't know one way or the other... it is a mystery\". Showing your western-centric spin on the world is good if you're debating someone else.\n \n \n \n And while you'll jump the gun and assume that anything non-Christian is against Christianity, you are mistaken. Science, if it supports Christianity, will not hide the fact. Now, if an atheist were to direct you to some ihategod-dot-com.... then you may have a case.\n \n \n You believe a lot of nonsense, such as Jesus' mysterious travels 'to Asia.'\n \n \n \n 2) Because of my own personal imperfections paired with my growing frustrations with closed-minded people, I am beginning to spout insults in jest. It's sort of arrogant, but hey.... when in Rome, do as the Roman Catholics do. See what I mean? It doesn't help your case to pick apart statements like that. I know you're not Roman Catholic, but no, it doesn't mean I'm totally ignorant to the ways of the Orthodox sect. I grow weary of such nitpicking and stupid arguing. Please, stick to the topic, which is: \"ONE TRUE CHURCH\".\n \n \n Ahem, you've just been debating me for some time as an Orthodox about what I am supposed to believe. As I said above, which ever target you're trying to hit, me as an Orthodox, or the Catholic Church, you miss; when on the issue of Holy Tradition. The only thing you'd be true to is about the Pope, but you actually directed that one to me, and I don't follow a Pope! So, you missed again, too. Trying to suggest that I'm changing the subject is quite a good little earner for you, except you're also been changing targets; and missing.\n \n \n 3) I argue several things, but they all go back to my major point. I may in one sentence say that Jesus isn't the Messiah. In the next, I'll state that just because the Pope makes claims, it doesn't give him any proven god-given authority. In the next, I'll talk about how Dubya's war is much like the Pope's church. Later, I'll argue that the Bible is unreliable. I know that you aren't capable of keeping up with my multi-tasking debate powers, but guess what? All of these things are related! How, you ask? They all go to prove one point: that the \"ONE TRUE CHURCH\" isn't the \"ONE TRUE CHURCH\". And just because I'm not arguing about your specific denomination of the Christian web doesn't mean my points are any less credible.... I mean, if you notice, this isn't the \"ORTHODOX OR ORNARY: YOU DECIDE...\" thread....\n \n \n You're a good judge at what's reliable! You've demonstrated that by your beliefs in Jesus' little walkabout.\n \n When you say you have argued that the Bible is unreliable, this is true, you've done that. But, stating opinion backed up by dodgy analogy is not a good way to sound convincing. Your maths argument; on demographics, seems to be one that you have both argued for and also against within one single posting! Actually providing evidence might help. Oh, the gnostics! That's right, because someone says the opposite to the Bible, the Bible is unreliable. Brilliant!\n \n Where are your 'many different Bible' evidences?",

   " Now, with that taken care of, let's break-down your moronic debating skills one-by-one:\n \n \n Wishful thinking.\n \n \nWhich Gospel of Thomas? Although none of them are accepted I'd just like you to define it because there's different reasons depending upon which Gospel of Thomas you're talking about.\n \n \n \nIt doesn't matter. The question is quite redundant (so, please, don't beg for an answer like a child who wants desperately to think they've won a point). How do I know your criteria are valid? Can they be scientifically proven??? This is my basic qualm: if your criteria could be debated by other Christians, how do you know you're right? And if you don't know you're right about the validity of texts, how can you prove your belief system isn't a myth?\n \n \n It does matter. Different methods for different books. State which one you're talking about.\n \n \nHuh? I just said 2,000 years of Church teachings says otherwise... we hold many books to be good. You're arguing from Protestant mentality again. Luther came along 1,500 years after the fact, disputes it, and you then argue that we're all inconsistent, and have been the whole 2,000 years. It's rather bizarre that a non-believer is actually giving credence to Protestant theories.\n \n \n \nBUT SOME ARE CALLED HERESIES. Obviously, if someone wrote those books, they (the writer) didn't think they were bad. So, this all goes back to my point: if your criteria could be debated by other Christians, how do you know you're right? And if you don't know you're right about the validity of texts, how can you prove your belief system isn't a myth?\n \n \n If I didn't know the validity, you'd be right. When you write a book about the USA law, and you've never studied law, is it valid? Of course not. There's a general framework - study, usually formal, helpful if you've actually had some practical experience with that knowledge. Same with the books of Christianity. A framework was established by Jesus who commissioned just 12 people. They in turn passed this commission on. It's called Apostolic Succession. Your Protestant perspective of Christianity would not have picked this up. (note I said your perspective is Protestant).\n \n We have Holy Tradition; what was always taught. If someone pops up and says \"Jesus was a tomato\" then we'd compare this to Holy Tradition and see if it's something we've always taught.\n \n \nAgain, Protestant thinking. Jesus commissioned his Apostles. He gave them the power of the Holy Spirit. He gave them the right to run the Church. Protestants don't believe this, and you agree with them! Funny that.\n \n \n \nProve the holy spirit. Prove that Jesus actually commissioned his Apostles. Prove any of your statements, and you automatically win the argument!\n \n \n I believe it, you don't. What's the point you're trying to make?\n \n \nWhy are the Protestants so bad anyway? Because they question what lacks evidence? Why should anyone believe what you state? Answer me that....\n \n \n Calm down. Protestants believe that anyone can interpret the Bible. Thus we've now got 100,000's of different churches. This helps you because then you can say \"How can they all be true?\" If someone like Luther comes along 1,500 years and decides to throw out tradition and leads people astray, then that's pretty bad.\n \n \nWhat part of me being Orthodox do you not understand? Actually the very fact you'd ask me to debate about the Pope in this way suggests strongly you've got bugger-all idea about Orthodoxy. Again a pro-Protestant debate. I should point out, I don't believe you're Protestant, but you've accepted them as normative of Christians. In a sense, it's like Satanists say that they don't believe in the Catholic Mass, but they say it, only backwards. So even though they reject it, they use it as the model; or the norm. You're doing the same thing, only you've no insight and little knowledge of Traditional Christianity and you're not even aware of this as you debate.\n \n \n \nActually, I know nothing but the basics of Protestantism, but loads and heaps about Catholicism.... I was, after all, raised a Catholic boy. Protestantism discredits me in the eyes of all your buddies, it must. Or else you'd stop with your childish methods of labelling. You know, Protestants are on quite level footing with all religions and denominations. Yep.... they're the equals of Catholics, Episcopals, and Orthodox Christians, as well as with Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, Mormons, Muslims.... etc.\n But I'm not arguing about the specifics of any denomination. This thread is about Catholicism, but it applies to all Christianity. So shut up with your bickering.\n \n \n Medication not working? Earlier you said I should concentrate on Catholicism, the subject of this post, now you're true colours, it's about all Christianity! It's nice of you to chop and change all the time. But the point is you've been trying to drag me into this by saying how can I believe in the Pope? I don't. You're a XXXXX to think that I would.\n \n \nNo... He said he understood what 'they' meant about me. He obviously wasn't referring to Catholics. You've not understood the criticism I raise, but you're still willing to defend him. Within the one paragraph his use of a pronoun changed without him changing reference to which 'they' he's referring to. It's quite obvious 'they' didn't in this case mean the Catholic Church, but whom he meant, I don't know. You're being rather petty by defending the indefensible.\n \n \n \nIf the indefensible is petty, my friend, you are the glorious king. So, again, shut up.\n \n \n You're a great debater. You jump in to defend a fool, and soon you wear his mantle. Later you'll show your own grasp of English.\n \n \nNo, not at all. Without really understanding what he was saying you've just leapt in to defend it, found it silly, then changed the focus to now talk about Jesus as Messiah, instead of divinely inspired that the Bible is. It's dishonest of you to keep moving the goalposts, but you're determined to score points.\n \n \n \nIf there is one main idea I must follow in order to belong to a religion, and I don't believe in that idea, I am not a member of said religion. So, whether it be the divinity of the Bible, the reliability of religious leaders, or the Messiah-ness (I know, I invented the word) of Jesus, the point is that most of the world would disagree with one or all of the above.\n More in depth, if the core of the Christian Bible is the New Testament?which basically depicts Jesus as being the Messiah?and I don't believe that Jesus was the Messiah, I reject the core of the Christian Bible. Maybe other faiths still call the Bible \"inspired\", but they don't revere the book as much as you do, and certainly, they don't belong to your faith. They reject your core belief, and so, in effect, reject your religion. They don't hate you or anything, they just don't believe you're correct.\n \n \n Yes, and as I said, you're demographic argument's a laugh. Most people in the world don't believe in Evolution therefore evolution is false. How many people believe in your religion; whatever that is?\n \n \nOrthodoxy is an Eastern faith. There are many eastern Christian faiths! You need to get out of the west once in a while. Even as a so called 'eastern' person you're still using western Christendom as a normative model; if only as the thing to which you reject.\n \n \n \nWhen I say Eastern faiths or Far Eastern faiths, I don't mean Orthodox Christianity, no matter what you want to think. I am talking about Hindu, Jainism, Buddhism, Shintoism, and other such \"naturalist\" faiths. And please don't start arguing about my use of the word naturalist.... that's not the point of this debate!!!!\n \n \n If you don't know what you're talking about, then it's pretty difficult to argue against you. Geography's not your strong-point. Orthodoxy has several main churches in Asia, one in Constantinople (right on the border), one in Africa. We're not a 'western' church. See earlier post about 'mysterious church'\n \n \n Again another re-working on your part. It is true that is what the thread is about. But Charchuk tried a falsifiable test based on the fact that there are less Christians than non-Christians, and that all those non-Christians don't believe in the Bible. I know you're desperate by now to point score, but reworking things doesn't sit as being honest.\n \n \n \nThere are less Christians than non-Christians. And non-Christians don't believe in the Christian Bible. It's a proven fact. Get over it. Non-Christians don't worship Jesus. Thus, they don't fully agree with your interpretation of the Bible. Obviously, if you Christians claim there's only one true way to interpret the Bible, they would seem to reject that interpretation, and hence, your Bible and belief system.\n I try to follow Jesus' golden rule.... I think the Bible was divinely inspired (I think all things are divine).... and I don't mind different belief systems. Do I reject Jesus as Messiah and the Bible as god's word?\n \n \n Yes, saying over and over again your demographic and statistical argument certainly doesn't help your case.\n \n \nYet another re-working of the debate. It's on the same falsifiable test that he ran, not I! He was claiming the Bible is false because hardly anyone believes in it. You now recognise how silly it is but you're not willing to criticise your ally Charchuk for raising a lame argument in the first place.\n \n \n \nYou need to learn how to read for context. He didn't at all claim that just because most people don't believe in it, it's false. XXXXX.\n \n \n You do, he does. Why raise the issue about the numbers then? Or, are you just intent on stating truisms? Of course you're not, you're being dishonest now because it's ridiculous. Otherwise, why are you now claiming to be your reason for issuing these facts - just for my personal information? \n \n \nAh, so you are using the Charchuk test on what's false. I wish you'd make up your mind. A moment ago you said percentages were a time waster. You're argument...\n \n \n \nLook, by logic, god could not just choose one small patch of people on earth and give them the true religion. It doesn't make sense. Our point is not that it's automatically false because it's a minority belief, just that it doesn't logically make as much sense as, say, Buddhism. I mean, how do you know you're right? Unless you know of every other faith, try it, and reject it, you can't know for sure. Your faith and the faith of all Christians is the only argument you have, but what is that faith built on? Trial and error, or arrogance? Which is more scientific?\n \n \n Christianity is the most wide-spread of religions. What are you trying to achieve by this line? God's method is illogical? Come now, you know the mind of God? Back when Christianity started out, it was known to a small few, now it's significantly bigger. It's the fastest growing faith in Africa, I'm lead to believe. It dominates four continents. But it's just as nonsensical as to claim that it is true by its success as you're trying to do to suggest that it's a failure.\n \n \n In absolute terms, if we're talking about all truths being tested, you might have a case. We're not though. At least I am not and neither is Charchuk (as far as I can tell). No great good has come from the war. Some (or lots, if you're on my side) has from Christianity, therefore they are incomparable. Something with goodness, to something with no goodness.\n But your argument is getting ridiculous. Your fundamental lack of knowledge on history is demonstrated in your second last sentence. How could Christianity have wreaked havoc in it's first century of existence? It is laughable that you are so pent up with hate for such a fine religion that you'd blame it for evils, even when it was a minority religion under severe persecution.\n \n \n \nAll things are related. War and organized religion both have a cause that I (and many others) believe to be flawed, so they can be compared. Quit trying to discredit by dodging the line of debate.\n \n \n Hang on, you're the one trying to discredit Christianity by comparing it to the War in Iraq. It makes just as much sense as me saying that I think Islam and Hepatitis-C are the same, because they both kill people.\n \n \nIn the first century, Christians were a warring people. They fought each other. They committed crimes, brother against brother, and not to mention, yes, they were persecuted by the Romans, like all other non-Roman belief systems. It was indeed a minority religion, and still is, but this status doesn't mean there wasn't and isn't great amounts of turmoil between its people and ideas.\n And by the way, let's not throw opinion statements into arguments.... \"such a fine religion\".... yeah, whatever you say, man....\n \n \n Logic is lacking. Again you are brining in a stats argument; some Christians were bad therefore... Show me where they were a 'warring people' though (what ever that means!).\n \n I seriously believe you need to study history before you say these things. The concept of a Christian and a 'just-war' didn't develop until Augustine, that's in the 400s!\n \n By and large Rome did not persecute all other non-Roman belief systems. Rome was very pluralistic. They adopted the Greek gods, for goodness sake! They may have been suspicious about some Egyptian faiths, Judaism and Christianity, but they accepted that there were many gods, and would frequently go to a friends house, pray to his gods, and so on.\n \n Why weren't they happy about the monotheistic faiths? Because they were exclusivist. Jews and Christians didn't say, \"Oh, look, you worship your gods, and we'll worship our one\". They said \"Your gods are false! There's only one God! Ours!\" This XXXXXX the Romans off. You fail on\n a) your knowledge of early Christianity\n b) your knowledge of Rome.\n \n \nThere were more than just 'images' But you missed them. You are blinded by hate. There were at least 10 link pages from the page I gave. By belittling it with such a minor off-hand statement it shows how much you actually looked at it; but then you weren't really prepared to, because your a priori beliefs is that it's all false anyway. Its circular reasoning there, but you can't see it.\n \n \n \nYou can't get mad because I don't see a Magic Eye picture. Unless you can prove it's actually there, it's not. With a Magic Eye picture, at least the artist could show me the process he went through to hide the intended image within the seemingly abstract art. This would show irrefutably that the image existed within the Magic Eye picture. Can you do this for me with your \"miracle\"? No? Then your evidence is biased and subjective. NEXT.....!\n \n \n I said that there was more to the site than a single picture. There were pages and pages of evidence. Did you read them all? No. You simplify it to a single picture, or a few pictures. That's dishonest. And, it's a joke\n \n \nSorry, then that makes not just you who is wrong. Heathen comes from 'heath' because the people who believed in gods had to go worship in the heath as they were unwelcome in Church. Sorry if I point out your glaring errors. How silly of me to do so in a debate. I'll try not to argue against your points next to you debate, maybe that would suit you better.\n \n \n When I made my humorous quip regarding the rise and takeover of the heathens, I didn't research the word. My apologies. Next time, when I'm being facetious, I'll make sure to include a bibliography so you can't sidetrack the argument.\n \n I'm not trying to be facetious. I am a pedantic person and if you argue 'a' then you'll get pinged if you really meant 'b'. It's taken you till now to actually pick-up on your error. As I said earlier, I'm sorry if I pick you up on all your errors, but that you would do the same; except you've not spotted any because of a poor education (lack of grammar, history, comparative religious knowledge etc). I called your bluff over the Gospel of Thomas. I know of four, and I know you don't. Instead you tried to pass it off that the method would be the same. (it isn't, by the way; I'll give you a hint... one was discovered only in 1948 therefore allegations that it is a recent fake is oft used; and such a tact would not be possible on a version that's much much earlier). I'm sorry that you're arguing from a position of lack of knowledge.\n \n \nIt just shows your ignorance of Holy Tradition, despite your claim. Again you're trying this numbers falsifiable test, that because some people disagree, the whole things a wank.\n But your ignorance comes into play because you don't know that at the beginning there was only one church. There weren't many! Even when there was debate and disagreement, there was one Church. Later on as some things were canonised, some people who were in disagreement stayed with the Church, some left....\n \n \n \nNo, there was not \"one church\". Some sects had \"heretical\" ideas.... are they a part of your church nowaday? They all called themselves Christians because of the influence of Christ, but they were in fact many different churches with different beliefs, or at least different versions of those beliefs. Is the orthodox church the same as the Catholic church? No? I thought you said there was only one!\n \n \n There WAS only one Church. Now there are not. I know you have problems with English. The split wasn't till c.1050. Show me heretical churches that existed from day one. Name one. Here your lack of knowledge about the subject of early church history is so apparent.\n \n \nOnly when Constantine made Christianity the state religion did there become an \"official\" church, and even then, rouge Christian sects still ran around doing whatever they did.... argue.... battle.... kill each other.... etc.\n And, oh, Gnostic.... argue my use of words, my friend.... 'tis the only point you can possibly gain ground on!\n \n \n I can only argue against the argument you present. You might be a mind-reader and understand what 'intent' was made; you seem sure about putting words into Charchuk's mouth anyway.\n \n What has Constantine got to do with anything? He made the church the official church of the Roman Empire. He did not make the Church the 'official church'. The very fact you are calling it posts 'the church' means you recognise that there was one church and you talk about heresies, if you know what that means, then you'll know that they were in disagreement with the one church because that's what heretics were. They disagreed with the one true church.\n \n \nNow, does your church initiate young boys by taking them naked into gardens....? Do you swallow semen to fill your body with its sacred power? Oh, you mean the Gnostics were the only ones who followed that holy tradition, proving that the tradition has changed over time? Or wait, did the \"church\" decide which traditions are holy? Cuz if it's the authority of god that allows them to determine which are holy, then the holiness of said traditions is in question.... I mean, can you prove this authority? So, which way do you want to lose.....?\n If holy tradition has changed?being as you don't swallow the precious nectar at mass?then I'd say you need to revoke all statements about how constant \"holy tradition\" has been and all arguments based on that assumed fact.\n If tradition is only holy if the holy spirit gives someone the power to interpret as so, then you're done. Prove that the holy spirit gave someone the power to deem something a holy tradition. Can you? Yeah, didn't think so, XXXXX.\n \n \n It wasn't traditional to swallow semen you dolt! You recognise that they are heretics, but you need to go an look up the word, because you don't know what it means. There was one church, with one teaching. People who disagreed with it were therefore, heretics. You recognise that they were in disagreement.\n \n Show me where it was traditional. Start by showing me the Biblical texts, or any other early Christian writer.\n \n It's about time you start digging up proof. You've already demonstrated the worth of your opinion; biased and lacking historical knoweldge. At least post a reference.\n \n \nHow do you know that there were earlier Bibles? Gnosticism? Show me the proof.\n It is laughable that you don't know the difference between Orthodoxy and Catholicism, but have the hide to debate on the issue. Shows you're an American, always has an opinion, even if you have no knowledge.\n \n \n \nThe Bible you read today is NOT the same Bible as was conceived back in the early history of the church. I can't name specific references, since I kinda understood this as common knowledge (I mean, you know that the Bible was put together and didn't just magically appear, right?).... books were added, books were subtracted..... XXXXX.\n \n \n You can name specific references? Go ahead, I've been waiting days for it. I've been asking, cajoling, begging, demanding. You're not very bright just repeating that you have evidence and leaving it at that.\n \n \n They are not 'far eastern' again your occidental quasi Protestant perspective is shinning through. The Orthodox Church is the church of the East! If you only knew something about it! But still, again your bias is showing. You quite happily lampoon Christianity because of Gnostic sources, and quite happily accept one that suggest Christ went east.\n \n \n \nChristianity is not the only religion. So shut up.\n \n \n Sounds like your happy pills have worn off. Show me the sources of your gnosticism. Time to put up or shut up.\n \n \nWhat a cute cop-out\n \n \n \nWhat's copping out? I gave you a book to read.... hop to it, XXXXX.\n \n \n Why? What a ridiculous notion. Someone invents a story, which you yourself admits is mostly 'weird'. And because you fall for a fairy-tale, you think it's the truth? which oddly, is something you'd accuse me of re: Christianity. So, it's okay for you to do it, because you're super smart.\n \n The rest of this is you bitching about how you've won the debate and I've not yet realised this.",

   "All right, I'm not going to bother picking this apart line-by-line every day....\n \n Listen.\n \n I need no proof, since I need only show you how your \"truth\" is built on assumptions and ideas that can be believed in blindly, but not proven. The fact is, neither of us has solid evidence on anything except a bunch of tenth-hand hearsay. It just doesn't exist. I mean, we can't prove that:\n \n a) Jesus was \"inspired\", the \"son of god\", or in any other way holy\n \n b) that any ancient Christian teachers, writers of holy texts, or current church leaders are \"inspired\", holy, or have any special abilities that allow them to know more of Jesus than any other person\n \n This is fact, and you know this. The key difference is that you are trying to prove your point (that Christianity and/or the Orthodox church are the \"one true church\"), whereas I'm simply showing you where your argument falls apart. Really, I'm not trying to prove anything. I'm just trying to unprove what you claim to have proven already.\n \n Follow me so far?\n \n Now, the matter of spirituality is a personal thing. I don't think religion should exist, I just think we should all seek things our own way. But I'm not everybody else, and I understand this. I don't hate Christians, I don't hate anyone, really.... but I'm kind of frustrated with both you and all Judeo-Christian believers who don't really connect personally with your spirituality. At best, someone else tells you the way to do it, and so, you follow up and do what they say.\n \n Also, I get angry when, from my perception, really ignorant, superstitious people jump on non-believers in mobs trying to prove their point that either Jesus is my only way to heaven, or to praise allah or whatever. I just want everyone to be individual in their spirituality, not just listen to their pastor/bishop/Pope.\n \n I mean, you do realize that what you base your faith on is a sort of mythology, right? Regardless of what you may assume, no one has a real record of Jesus Christ. There are countless stories about him, plenty of believers in him, and lots of influence from his followers.\n \n But what do you base this Christianity on?\n \n Lineage? That's what you claim. Let's take this notion for a spin....\n \n Can we prove that Jesus ever existed?\n I mean, yeah, a lot of people wrote about him.... but a lot of people have written about Dracula.... a whole mythology was started around him.... a whole world of vampire stories. Ever read about the game Vampire: The Masquerade? There's a whole \"vampire bible\" what was written for it. There, it claims that Caine was the first vampire. Then, it proceeds to give a lineage from Caine down to modern-day vampires. Each vampire could trace his bloodline back to Caine, even when kids play the game. The steps are easy! Vampires live a long time, to it's only about 13 \"generations\" to get back to Caine. Remember news stories about how kids were taking the game too seriously.... cutting themselves.... drinking each other's blood.... treating it like reality? Well, if I were to have my chart of lineage, and trace it back to Caine, that would prove that vampires existed, right? I mean, I can trace the path back to Caine! Okay, I'm sure that example's not good enough for you.... let's try another. Let's look at a generic family tree. You can trace back your history so far as it's recorded. I'd bet I could trace back as far as a few hundred years. But what about farther back? What kinds of reliability issues would I run into, trying to verify names, locations, the next \"branch\".... even if my mother told me every ancestor we had since Noah-name, age, place of birth-how on earth could I know this was true? Could I possibly verify every single link I was given? Or would I just have to believe blindly? What if my mother had told me that she had done all the research for me? Or maybe a family friend had? Or a professor at my school? How could I know the truth? What if one of my ancestors was James, the brother of Jesus? How could I be disproven? Could it be verified?\n \n You see.... even if you have details upon details about the lineage of the church after Jesus, it still doesn't give two key facts:\n \n a) the proof that Jesus, as the Messiah, commissioned his apostles to teach his word\n \n b) the complete unbiased scientific and historic verifications of this lineage\n \n How do you know the lineage is accurate? Maybe the names were created.... or even if the names weren't, maybe the connections to obviously historic people were falsified.\n \n The problem is that you can't prove anything with a document that old, unless it has unbiased science and history backing it. And even then, does it prove that Jesus was the Messiah?\n \n The problem with Christianity is the lack of conclusive facts.\n Especially with the Orthodox.... everything's a mystery, right? No men should try to explain the holy mysteries, correct? The Catholics dig their own holes by trying to have an answer for everything. But apparently, the Orthodox have an all-purpose easy-way-out. If you can't explain it, it must be a mystery.... as long as it coincides with previous teachings and holy traditions. Simple, eh? How do you know your holy traditions are correct? How do you know that they were blessed? Can you prove the intangible? Even if they came from what you think is Jesus, how can you be sure he was the holy entity you claim he is? How do you know some crazy bastard didn't teach some poor young Christian bishop the wrong stuff? You don't. In order to believe in any of your \"facts\", you have to assume something that cannot be proven: that holy power exists, and that it given to Jesus, and/or Jesus had the ability to give that power to his deciples. It's a leap of faith. But faith has no place in a debate. No matter the evidence, unless you can prove that Jesus was even in any way holy, let alone the son of God and Messiah to the Chosen People, you have no ground to stand on.\n \n The Bible and other documents were selected.\n Who selected them? How was their (the selectors) authority granted? How do you know that they even had the holy knowledge to select the books? How do you know that Jesus had chosen them? How do you know that Jesus gave them holy authority to select the holy works? How do you know that Jesus was holy enough to give those people these powers? How do you know Jesus was holy???\n Could not have other \"heretical\" documents been the truth, but some Christians disagreed with them, and so, labeled them evil or bad? Why were the Gnostics even called heretics? How do you know that the \"orthodox\" perception of Jesus by his apostles was even conducive to passing on holy traditions? How do you know that Jesus was even holy?????\n \n There are apparently Gnostic texts in existence that mention how Jesus initiated young boys into his faith and belief system by taking them into the Garden of Gethsemanie... naked. But this apparently Jesus, here. How do you know that this version of Jesus was not just quelled by a few disagreers? Maybe this holy tradition happened, but perhaps it was forgotten or rejected by modern thinkers....\n \n The early church was in turmoil.\n Early Christians couldn't agree on anything. There were the ones who wanted to focus on this tradition.... on that tradition.... on personal knowledge.... on obedient following.... I mean, there were countless sects, you can't disagree on that. While each may have called his each the \"orthodox\" or \"one true church\", each was in conflict with the other. This conflict often escalated into violence. Still with me? Well, my point here is that it's quite easy for one of many to claim they're the singular truth amidst the crowd.... but only the one who prevailed could claim that prize. Whichever church won the bout could easily dismiss all other churches' claims at intimate knowledge of Christianity, but if the dominant church never lent those claims any credence.... it would seem as if there had only been the \"one true church\" all along.... with a bunch of little heretics running around at its heels. Am I accusing your church of being that dominant church that would ignore all claims of knowledge? Absolutely.... you too, Catholics!\n \n \n I could go on for pages, but quite frankly, I'm tired.\n \n \n This is the final summation and conclusion to the argument.\n You can present whatever evidence you can find. You can quote scripture until you're blue in the face.... post url liks.... demand that I give evidence for my claims.... but until you can prove one little, minute piece of evidence, your \"facts and figures\" are nothing but castles built on mudslides.\n \n Unless you can solidly prove that Jesus was the Messiah.... that he was \"holy\".... and was the son of god.... all other claims are hereby null and void.\n \n I do believe the argument is over.",

Really, I'm not trying to prove anything. I'm just trying to unprove what you claim to have proven already.\n Follow me so far?\n\n \n This is the most gutless of your posts so far. You made specific claims in previous posts. Prove them... prove to me that there were other Bibles. Prove to me which Gnostic teachings have stemmed from Jesus. You make these claims, like a pope, you are infallible, and you don't need to prove anything. What a joke.\n \n I said that Orthodoxy is the One True Church, it is true. You said, No it isn't, because....\n and then you brought up lame evidences such as\n a) The Gospel of Thomas\n which has no context. Shouting out \"The Gospel of Thomas\" means nothing as I've no idea which one you're talking about. I asked you to clarify, as there are different rebuttals depending on which one you're talking about. But you won't. You won't even give me the opportunity of refuting your evidence by laying it out for all to see.\n b) the demographics/statistics argument; that there are more non-Christians than Christians, therefore how can Christianity be the truth, then you retreat from that and say that's not what you're arguing at all. So, therefore, you're just issuing forth a truism as if it by itself means something, like \"The Parramatta River is in Sydney\"; it is true, but it has no context in the debate.\n c) you try another best of both worlds arguments too, you mentions some Gnostics practiced some things. You asked if I did. What was the context of these Gnostic practices? The very fact that they were only practiced by Gnostics should have alerted to you something; the nature of a heretic is to go against teaching. If there's a teaching that's normative, and you go against it, you're a heretic. By being a heretic you are not proving your own views.\n \n Now, the matter of spirituality is a personal thing. I don't think religion should exist, I just think we should all seek things our own way. But I'm not everybody else, and I understand this. I don't hate Christians, I don't hate anyone, really.... but I'm kind of frustrated with both you and all Judeo-Christian believers who don't really connect personally with your spirituality. At best, someone else tells you the way to do it, and so, you follow up and do what they say.\n \n So you're arguing for a multitude of truths? Each person has their own truth? There is a truth that exists outside of you, whether you believe in it or not. For instance, I exist. I existed before you even 'experienced' me. I don't know if you're an existentialist.\n \n \nAlso, I get angry when, from my perception, really ignorant, superstitious people jump on non-believers in mobs trying to prove their point that either Jesus is my only way to heaven, or to praise Allah or whatever. I just want everyone to be individual in their spirituality, not just listen to their pastor/bishop/Pope.\n\n \n What you want is different from what is. I'd like there to be no wars. Just wishing it to be so doesn't make it happen. See about external truths above.\n \n \nI mean, you do realize that what you base your faith on is a sort of mythology, right? Regardless of what you may assume, no one has a real record of Jesus Christ. There are countless stories about him, plenty of believers in him, and lots of influence from his followers.\n But what do you base this Christianity on?\n\n \n As I said, Jesus lived. Those who witnessed him passed things down. I made a mistake earlier in mentioning the Didache. I said it was written c.150. In fact, it was written earlier. http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/ suggests a date between 50-120 AD. If you check their site they show writings even earlier. Believing as you do that it was all made up centuries later, again, does not make it so.\n \n But again you're being inconsistent. You question now the historical Jesus (see below), yet earlier you said you believed He travelled 'to Asia'. How did He, if He didn't exist? It is hard to follow you when you argue all points of view at once.\n \n \nLineage? That's what you claim. Let's take this notion for a spin....\n Can we prove that Jesus ever existed?\n I mean, yeah, a lot of people wrote about him.... but a lot of people have written about Dracula.... a whole mythology was started around him.... a whole world of vampire stories.

Your opinion that lineages in general may be made-up again does not disprove it about my claim. There is a difference between opinion and fact.\n \n James was not the literal brother of Jesus. When yo' down in da' hood, do yo' say \"Hey, bro, wa's happnin?\" Brother is a figure of speech.\n \n [QUOTE=Killakozzy]You see.... even if you have details upon details about the lineage of the church after Jesus, it still doesn't give two key facts:\n a) the proof that Jesus, as the Messiah, commissioned his apostles to teach his word\n b) the complete unbiased scientific and historic verifications of this lineage\n How do you know the lineage is accurate?

Yes, suppose there is a conspiracy and people faked these things, but again opinion and supposition are not proofs.\n \n [QUOTE=Killakozzy] Especially with the Orthodox.... everything's a mystery, right? No men should try to explain the holy mysteries, correct? The Catholics dig their own holes by trying to have an answer for everything. But apparently, the Orthodox have an all-purpose easy-way-out. If you can't explain it, it must be a mystery.... as long as it coincides with previous teachings and holy traditions. Simple, eh?\n \n Indeed, if you can't explain something it is a mystery. That's what a mystery is. I don't know how such simple logic escapes you. And, I didn't say everything's a mystery. I said we are less dogmatic that Catholics, go read it again.\n \n It's almost ironic that you first accuse my church of being dogmatic; with an all-powerful pope, and now you backtrack (because you were choosing the wrong target) to criticise my church for being less dogmatic. Again your ability to argue all sides at once is amazing. We are an eastern faith. Yours too is an eastern faith. (You said earlier you had a faith, but in this post you attack religions per se; further proof of having all sides at once).\n \n [QUOTE=Killakozzy]How do you know your holy traditions are correct?\n \n Define correct. What do you mean by this question?\n \n [QUOTE=Killakozzy]How do you know that they were blessed?\n \n Define blessed. Blessed by whom?\n \n [QUOTE=Killakozzy]Can you prove the intangible?\n \n I don't know. You would have to give me your framework for accepting a truth as being proven. I believe Magellan existed. My belief is intangible. That Magellan was real; is that intangible?\n \n [QUOTE=Killakozzy]Even if they came from what you think is Jesus, how can you be sure he was the holy entity you claim he is? How do you know some crazy bastard didn't teach some poor young Christian bishop the wrong stuff? You don't.\n \n As I keep telling you, we have a number of bishops, we have the people who also carry the traditions. If one bishop came out and said \"St. Peter came from Mars\" we'd have the ability to test the claim to what is known. Even if all the Bishops at a Council proclaimed it; it doesn't pass into dogma until approved by the people. I gave you instances before where the people have rejected the claims made by Council. Simply speculating something might have occurred does not make it so. Your whole post is like this.\n \n [QUOTE=Killakozzy]In order to believe in any of your \"facts\", you have to assume something that cannot be proven: that holy power exists, and that it given to Jesus, and/or Jesus had the ability to give that power to his disciples. It's a leap of faith. But faith has no place in a debate. No matter the evidence, unless you can prove that Jesus was even in any way holy, let alone the son of God and Messiah to the Chosen People, you have no ground to stand on.\n \n Faith has every part in a debate. You are using it all the time; suppose this happened, suppose that happened. It has a place in debate, but it must be weighed up as to whether it is reasonable or not. Your own lack of insight to your own statements of faith; and then deriding faith is quite amazing.\n \n [QUOTE=Killakozzy]The Bible and other documents were selected.\n Who selected them? How was their (the selectors) authority granted? How do you know that they even had the holy knowledge to select the books? How do you know that Jesus had chosen them? How do you know that Jesus gave them holy authority to select the holy works? How do you know that Jesus was holy enough to give those people these powers? How do you know Jesus was holy???\n \n This series of questions suggests a) you don't know and b) you didn't read my earlier posts (which is why you don't know). I told you the Early Church much debated these things and if something just cropped up; like a Gospel of Thomas which went against centuries of Holy Tradition, then it could be dismissed. Carrying-on about speculation is fruitless.\n \n [QUOTE=Killakozzy]Could not have other \"heretical\" documents been the truth, but some Christians disagreed with them, and so, labelled them evil or bad?\n \n I thought you put the maths argument to bed. What percent of people disagreeing with them makes them untrue?\n \n [QUOTE=Killakozzy]Why were the Gnostics even called heretics?\n \n Because they believed in things that were not orthodox. You really need to research the meaning of the word. Their whole notion of gaining knowledge through personal experience; such as your notion; went against orthodox teaching. If a teacher says to you \"We will learn about the news from watching TV\" That could be an example of being orthodox. If you reject this and say \"No, I actually have to experience these events for myself\" then you would be going your own way - being a heretic.\n \n [QUOTE=Killakozzy]How do you know that the \"orthodox\" perception of Jesus by his apostles was even conducive to passing on holy traditions? How do you know that Jesus was even holy?????\n \n I can go an check all the sources; orthodox, non-orthodox myself. I mentioned to you one of the Infancy Gospels of Thomas. It alone mentions that Jesus was rather vindictive as a child; using His holy powers against others. This in itself goes against the other notions of Jesus; that Jesus was full of love. It contradicts them. The Infancy Gospel of Thomas was itself mentioned by other writers; only as early as 185.\n A modern secular study of the Gospel says...\n \"To a modern reader, the Infancy Gospel of Thomas is probably the most humorous of the ancient Christian writings.\"\n and\n \"The usage of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas can be traced back as far as Ireaneus of Lyons in 185 C.E. and similar stories are found even earlier in the Epistle of the Apostles. The Infancy Gospel of Thomas is clearly not the work of the disciple of Jesus mentioned in all four canonical gospels. Thomas is not only not named as author in the earliest manuscripts, but the text was also briefly ascribed to James. Further, the text was not written by any first century writer because the author shows virtually no knowledge of Jewish life in the time of Jesus (the author knows about Jerusalem and Passover, but little more). \"\n http://gospels.net/additional/infancythomasadditional.html\n \n Thus, the early writers who encountered it rejected it. Modern scholarship agrees.\n \n You too can go an check, rather than just form and spout ad hoc opinion ad nauseum.\n \n \nThere are apparently Gnostic texts in existence that mention how Jesus initiated young boys into his faith and belief system by taking them into the Garden of Gethsemanie... naked. But this apparently Jesus, here. How do you know that this version of Jesus was not just quelled by a few disagreers? Maybe this holy tradition happened, but perhaps it was forgotten or rejected by modern thinkers....\n\n \n It would be good if you cite what book you're getting this from. What was Jesus initiating them into? Does it even seem consistent with other 'stories' of Jesus?\n \n We have many stories about Abe Lincoln as a boy. If you see that one of them says that when he was seven, he was already 8ft 6 and you go 'hang on, he was only 'x' high\" then you can suspect that story. Use common sense if you must. Try it.\n \n \nThe early church was in turmoil.\n\n \n Such an open statement. What do you mean by turmoil? Wars? Spats? Debates? What?\n \n \nEarly Christians couldn't agree on anything. There were the ones who wanted to focus on this tradition.... on that tradition.... on personal knowledge.... on obedient following.... I mean, there were countless sects, you can't disagree on that. While each may have called his each the \"orthodox\" or \"one true church\", each was in conflict with the other. This conflict often escalated into violence. Still with me? Well, my point here is that it's quite easy for one of many to claim they're the singular truth amidst the crowd.... but only the one who prevailed could claim that prize. Whichever church won the bout could easily dismiss all other churches' claims at intimate knowledge of Christianity, but if the dominant church never lent those claims any credence.... it would seem as if there had only been the \"one true church\" all along.... with a bunch of little heretics running around at its heels. \n\n \n And as I said, Jesus appointed 12. He said that these would be the teachers of the truth. He established the framework. Protestants disagree, they came about 1,500 years later and rejected this notion that had sustained the church. That there should be only teachers knowledgeable. They said \"Anyone can be a teacher\", and what's more is that they concentrated on only one book; the Bible. Jesus never said \"Everyone, go out and make things up for yourselves!\". Jesus Himself gave rules for belief.\n \n \nAm I accusing your church of being that dominant church that would ignore all claims of knowledge? Absolutely.... you too, Catholics!\n\n \n I don't understand what you mean by this.\n \n \nI could go on for pages, but quite frankly, I'm tired.\n\n \n You sound it. Spouting opinion devoid of facts must be very draining.\n \n \nThis is the final summation and conclusion to the argument.\n You can present whatever evidence you can find. You can quote scripture until you're blue in the face.... post url liks.... demand that I give evidence for my claims.... but until you can prove one little, minute piece of evidence, your \"facts and figures\" are nothing but castles built on mudslides.\n\n \n This is one of the funniest things you've stated so far and by far the most demonstrable indication that you're unaware of what you're saying. You're saying that until I prove something, without quoting anything (Scriptures, web-sites etc) I have lost. How bizarre? I guess though this is one thing consistent. As you don't think that quoting sources is necessary to your own argument, you've allowed me the same luxury of being fatless in my reply. Yes, facts and figures... what do they prove?\n \n I would take it that this is a sign of just how tired you really are except that you've been consistently muddled in definitions of what you mean.\n \n \nUnless you can solidly prove that Jesus was the Messiah.... that he was \"holy\".... and was the son of god.... all other claims are hereby null and void.\n\n \n How? By using my opinion?\n \n \nI do believe the argument is over.\n\n \n For you it was over days ago when you decided not to provide any evidence for your claims (read opinions). Maybe you're now sick of embarrassing yourself.\n \n PS\n And I was kinder to you this time; I didn't lampoon you at all for making up words such as 'disprovers', or for spelling mistakes.",
