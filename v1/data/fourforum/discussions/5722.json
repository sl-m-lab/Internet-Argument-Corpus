   "On July 4, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress. In the second paragraph, we read:\n \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are, Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\n \n In what sense are these claims \"self-evidently\" true ? Take the claim that all men are created equal. What is meant by \"equal\" ? It must have some special meaning that is not self-evident: while it is self-evident (or axiomatic) to say 7 + 5 equals 12, it is not self-evident that all men are equal unless some aspect of equality is specified. Human beings can be equally tall, equally rich, perhaps equally ridiculous, etc., but they must be equally something. They cannot be meaningfully described just as self-evidently equal.\n \n If a statement is difficult to understand then it cannot be self-evident. Did Jefferson and his colleagues really know what they were talking about ?",

There is never full equality even in this limited respect - children and the mentally deranged being treated differently from responsible adults of sound mind etc. \n \n On material equality - which is often advocated and seems to get subsumed by sloppy thinking into \"all men are equal\" claims, the jury is still out (and will probably never deliver a verdict) on whether any political arrangement can or ought to provide material equality to those who belong to it. Constant acts of redistribution would be required to satisfy such a claim, and these acts are not compatible with respecting certain \"natural\" rights. \n \n It is certainly ironic, as you point out, that Jeffersonian rhetoric about the self-evidence of \"equality\" was proclaimed at a time when many of the authors of the Declaration owned slaves !",

   "Well, that's the whole Hobbes vs Locke debate, isn't it.\n \n I guess the main thing with Hobbes is to recognise that the \"state of nature\" is really a sort of hypothetical, and that in a real \"state of nature\" men tend to band together immediately, rather than killing each other on sight in a \"warre\", since the benefits of cooperation, for protection, the division of labour, socialisation, risk insurance, sharing of skills and knowledge, stretch into an indefinite future, while the benefits of a slaying are only immediate. Those who are nasty and brutish tend to lose out to those who aren't, since one, however nasty, tends to lose to two, or five hundred.\n \n The \"social contract\" is a hypothetical too, there isn't actually any such contract, it's really a way of explaining a way why the behaviour supposedly legitimate in a state of nature takes on a wrongful character in society. For that to work however, doesn't a breach of a contract, even a hypothetical contract, have to be a wrongful act? Social contract theory appears to me to dissolve into moral relativism when its premises are implied consistently.\n \n The explanation for the rise of society doesn't rely on any contract, or on any rights, merely on the practical benefits social behaviour supplies.\n \n Anyway I'm sure you're aware of all this already.\n \n Natural rights are an unpopular theory, but understood correctly I think they make a lot more sense. A lot of the time they are misinterpreted as \"Well, if there was no police, I could shoot you, so you have no right to bodily integrity\", but this entirely misses the point, rights aren't about a magic shield of morality that protects you from harm, they're about outlining the difference between peaceful and violent interaction, about what consitutes society and what the warre.\n \n Recognising that social interaction is productive, and violent interaction counterproductive, for man, a society governed in accordance with \"natural rights\" would therefore be expected to be more prosperous than one in which a state of warre was forcibly upheld, such that even if the rights were an artificial construct, they are at least a practical one. The US did alright out of working with them, yeah? Perhaps what is confusing with the Hobbesian interpretation is that State and Society are sort of conflated - the existence of government doesn't end a \"warre of all against all\", bad governance may create a warre of all against all where peaceful social cooperation previously existed.\n \n Nevertheless, there is also in my view some good argument for natural rights having an explicitly moral character, although the view is no longer popular. That really begins with an explication of what exactly a \"right\" is; which is essentially a morally legitimate claim, one which can be protected with force without violating anothers' right. In other words, something which the infringement of is legitimately punishable.\n \n There are several competing views on this, and I'm sure you've heard the classic half-hearted explanations from the classical liberals yourself, but the best contemporary advocates in my view are those working with \"argumentation ethics\", who essentially argue those who violate natural law are unable to consistently object to being punished.\n \n I have an exam tomorrow, so I won't go into them now, but I think there is another thread on them around somewhere.\n \n In any case I don't expect to demolish opposition to a theory of natural law, it's not a popular theory, especially amongst academics, I'm just happy for it to have a fair hearing, rather than the usual \"LOL LOL there's no such thing as 'rights' you religious XXXXX, I can shoot you and your rights don't do anything to stop me so you don't have them!!\"",

   "@ Symbiote:\n \n I think we've agreed that Jefferson's declaration, considered as part of a political/moral manifesto rather than just a rhetorical flourish, contains hidden assumptions about the nature of man.\n \n In the hypothetical \"state of nature\", which only philosophers and dreamers like Rousseau seem to bother about, we have supposed two scenarios:\n \n 1). A world according to Hobbes in which merciless and savage competition is the \"norm\". The strong destroys or subjugates the weak and accumulates power, wealth, etc. The brotherhood of man is unheard of and the lawlessness of the jungle prevails. Violence, terror, and vice characterise the place, and life is short and terribly uncertain. Might is right.\n \n 2). A world according to Locke in which sensible co-operation is worked out and the virtues of mutuality and trust combine to create peaceful co-existence, and rights of use like private property. This place is characterised by peace, progress, and security under the rule of non-arbitrary law. It is seen to be in the rational interests of humanity that this \"world\" - or something that will eventually yield an approximation to it - is the best option available.\n \n Both these \"worlds\" presuppose a theory of human nature. In the case of Hobbes, the nature of man is selfish, aggressive, and acquisitive, and the natural law cannot be deduced from it. But Locke assumes the desire for liberty is natural and fulfillable and that a natural law exists in a state of nature. A \"law of nature\" is implanted in all reasonable beings and reason can apprehend natural rights. (Locke also says that the implant was effected by God, but we must let that pass).\n \n If we follow Locke, the \"liberal\" societies with which we are familiar emerge. On your more restricted view, claiming that the practical benefits that co-operative behaviour supplies are sufficient to explain the rise of society, then Locke's \"natural rights\" are a kind of philosophical bonus to the process. \n \n If we follow Hobbes, we deny the existence of any rights whatever that are not granted by the powerful (the state); and what has been granted can always be withdrawn. Logically, if we stick to this route, we must end up defending political absolutism as desirable and, ultimately, perhaps the frightful atrocities of fascism.\n \n So I must temper my enthusiam for the Hobbes view of human nature and weaken my claim that politics and society have evolved in the way he describes in his \"Leviathan\". Though I'm still not convinced that man is a social animal adapted by nature to do quiet and peacable business with his neighbours. The rather feeble observation that recorded history \"proves\" my point because it's nothing more than a register of crime, folly, and misfortune will not answer.\n \n PS.\n Abstractions such as \"natural law\", a state of nature\", \"social contract\", etc. are presumably still discussed in pubs where students gather to escape their studies ?",

I find it difficult to work out exactly what was meant by the phrase; I think it's best to just interpret the thing as a whole and not worry too much about the small things that sound sort of odd, until someone can come up with an interpretation of what they mean in a way that makes sense, especially because of the subtle changes in language since it was written.

The determinism/free will debate seems to attract more interest from others, though Peter Singer occassionally comes into play, and of course there are the marxists, most of whom have neither read nor understood Marx. I think if you asked you would find most students have utilitarian intuitions, and then there are the bunch who think they are geniuses because they had the idea that morality is just an urban legend.

   "I disagree. \"Self-evident\" was a good choice of words then, and now.\n \n #1 Self-evident is commonly used in place of \"axiom\", which is exactly what is being defined. \n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom\n \n The word axiom comes from the Greek word &#945;&#958;&#953;&#969;&#956;&#945; (axioma), which means that which is deemed worthy or fit or that which is considered self-evident. \n \n In epistemology, an axiom is a self-evident truth upon which other knowledge must rest, from which other knowledge is built up. Not all epistemologists agree that any axioms, understood in that sense, exist.\n \n #2 You suggest that \"obvious\" is a synonym for \"self-evident\". I don't see good evidence that you would be correct to make such an assumption, given the definition of the word.\n \n #3 Again on the \"obvious\" remark, obvious in no way removes the requirement for rational evidence. Obvious just means it doesn't take any (many) steps to see that rational evidence which supports the claim. \n \n i.e. As the sun is beating down on your face, sweat pouring down your chin, you can barely see from the glare of the sun, you remark to the guy next to you \"I believe it's must be hot out here\". Ya think??\n \n The evidence is \"obvious\" to the casual observer, the evidence is not \"missing\".\n \n Exactly opposite of that, axioms are defined precisely to not require evidence, and in this case, there is no such thing as \"evidence\", since it's not something that actually exists. It's a concept. What evidence would you propose we present for \"men are equal under the law?\" There is none, that's why it's axiomatic. \"Evidence in and of itself\", not \"obviously evident\". Most axioms we throw around are NOT \"obvious\", we have to read or think quite a bit just to figure most of them out.\n \n #4 You seem hung up on the lack of precision when declaring WHAT is \"equal\". I think it's done exactly in that way for two reasons. First it's not a musing between two friends, it's a declaration of independance from english LAW, from the GOVERNMENT, from NOBILITY. Equality likewise refers to \"equal under the law\", \"equal in the eyes of the government\", and \"nobility we reject\". I'd say that is an example of \"obvious\" ;)\n \n Second, the declaration is an F-U, not a description of laws for the government. It is precise where it needs to be...note the precise listing of grievances it details which is, after all, it's man focus. But even it it were the foundation for law itself, and it's focus was changed to suit your desire, this is exactly how the constitution was written. It does not detail every little thing, to try to would most likely weaken it, and the nation founded on it. It leaves the nuance to the people.\n \n -Mach",
