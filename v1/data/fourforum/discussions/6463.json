Anyway, if he had to operate with the kind of money other teams have they could easily be an under-.500 team. Take a look at how many people have stayed throughout the years. They got Giambi and make Oakland look good. They got Womack from AZ and now he's gone. They have made a few good decisions such as Scheffield and A-Rod. Matsui they actually got through their farm organization (I think) and Posada's been there forever. Other than that, they keep pumping dollar after dollar into the system and rarely actually getting a quality player. Last year, the Cards were spending over $100 million less and had a better winning percentage. I would guess the same is true this year. The angels have a decent team but a low payroll. Steinbrunner throws money this way and that and expects to win series', and it worked for a while, but they haven't won in a while and I hope they never do in the near future. They always are contenders, but when it comes down to the wire, they can't come through. \n \n I see a Red Sox-Cards rematch series. Boston has an amazing pitching staff that pretty much won it last year. They've got Schilling, Wells, Clement, and then come back with Wakefield, such a difference from the other 3 with his knuckleballs. Then they have the offense behind Ortiz, Manny, Varitek, Renteria, Damon, Nixon, wow.\n \n But the Cards have Carpenter, Mulder, Morris, Marquis, Mulder, Suppan. All of these pitchers are amazing. Then they have Pujols, Eckstein (good lead-off hitter), Walker, Edmonds, Sanders. And when Isringhausen comes out, he pretty much always shuts it down for the last inning.\n \n Of course it will be difficult for any team to beat the trio of Pettite-Oswalt-Clemens.",
