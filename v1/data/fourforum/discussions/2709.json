Lots of things make sense to anti-gunners. Most of those things that make sense to them are down right ILLEGAL. Plus being an 'extra function' of the military will make the militia part of the Army. The militia is NOT part of the Army, the National Guard, or the Reserves.

Chew on a little history and facts:\n \n Source \n \n \n The meaning of the phrase \"well-regulated\" in the 2nd amendment\n From: Brian T. Halonen <halonen@csd.uwm.edu<\n The following are taken from the Oxford English Dictionary, and bracket in time the writing of the 2nd amendment:\n \n 1709: \"If a liberal Education has formed in us well-regulated Appetites and worthy Inclinations.\"\n \n 1714: \"The practice of all well-regulated courts of justice in the world.\"\n \n 1812: \"The equation of time ... is the adjustment of the difference of time as shown by a well-regulated clock and a true sun dial.\"\n \n 1848: \"A remissness for which I am sure every well-regulated person will blame the Mayor.\"\n \n 1862: \"It appeared to her well-regulated mind, like a clandestine proceeding.\"\n \n 1894: \"The newspaper, a never wanting adjunct to every well-regulated American embryo city.\"\n \n The phrase \"well-regulated\" was in common use long before 1789, and remained so for a century thereafter. It referred to the property of something being in proper working order. Something that was well-regulated was calibrated correctly, functioning as expected. Establishing government oversight of the people's arms was not only not the intent in using the phrase in the 2nd amendment, it was precisely to render the government powerless to do so that the founders wrote it.",

There are those out there that believe that the second ammendment conveys a collective right, but none that I have seen so far actually get this from any kind of interpetation of hte second ammendment. The collective rights theory was born through misapplication and mis-citing the SCOTUS decision regarding the miller case. \n \n The text of the second ammendment simply does not support the collective rights theory in any way.\n \n The collective rights theory was formed on the grounds that since the Miller court ruled that in order for a weapon to be protected under the second ammendment it must be militarily useful, it follows that in order for a person to have protection under the second ammendment, they, too, would have to militarily useful, i.e a member of the organised militia. \n \n There are a few problems with this. first off, that is not how case law is established in the US, especially no when it comes to constitutional questions. Second, the miller court did not rule that a weapon had to be in active militaryily use in order to be protected, just that it had to be militarily usefull (useful in a military capacity). Third, the theory flies right in the face of the evidence that the supreme court has ruled most important in dealing with issues of a constitutional nature, and that is original intent. Nobody has ever managed to advance a single shred of documentary evidence that showed our founding fathers were not recognising an individual right. the collective rights theory has no historical basis whatsoever.\n \n In order to read the text of the second ammendment and come to the conclusion that it somehow conveys a collective right, you would first have to be ignorant in common use and verbage of the english language. The rules of useage inthe english language are well documented. In fact, by those well documented rules, even today, the first clause is a justification clause, the second is the actionable clause, and the actionable clause is in no way dependant on the justification clause.\n \n Second, you would have to be ignorant regarding the use of he term \"well regulated\" and the legal definition of \"regulated\" during the time that the document was penned.\n \n Third, you would have to be ignorant as to the meaning of the word \"militia\" whose definition has not changed one iota since the day the constitution was written.\n \n This all does not matter, though, because those who created and intelligently argue the \"collecitve rights\" theory know that it is NOT based on an interpetation of the constitution as much as it is based on a misapplication of the SCOTUS ruling in the miller case.\n \n GG's who somehow try to tie the collective rights drivel to the text of the second ammendment without using the miller case are just ignorant parrots who are arguing for a concept which they do not even understand. I am a little disapointed that nobody has tried to argu proper implementation of the Milelr decision here/. That is a point that I particularly enjoy arguing.",

   "\n The text of the second ammendment simply does not support the collective rights theory in any way.\n\n Yes it does. Consider these words of wisdom from Paul Finkleman: \"Consider, for example, the term 'people' in the First Amendment 'Congress shall make no law . . . prohibiting . . . the right of the people peaceably to assemble . . . . ' If it is hard to construe the word 'people' in the Fourth Amendment to be anything but a reference to individuals, it is equally difficult to construe the term in the First Amendment as anything but a collective right. Clearly, the idea of the people assembling contemplates a large number of people and not a single person assembling. Thus, linguistically, the term 'people' in the Second Amendment might be interpreted 'either way.' Standing alone, the phrase 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' could apply to individuals or collectively to 'the people.' But, unlike the use of the word in the Fourth Amendment, the Second Amendment ties the term 'people' to a collective entity, the 'well regulated Militia' which is 'necessary to the security of a free State.' This understanding is also supported by the original wording of the Amendment, which referred to the 'body' of the people. Linguistically, the Amendment can easily be read to concern the 'body'of the people. The Amendment does not say, 'individually armed citizens, being necessary to the security of a free state . . . . ' The Amendment explicitly refers to the 'militia,' a collective organization and a specific kind of militia at that one that is 'well regulated.' It is hard to imagine individuals being 'well regulated' by the government. They are only 'regulated' as a group.\"\n http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/FinkelmanChicago.htm\n So the plain language of the second amendment supports the collective rights theory. That's all the documentary evidence I need.\n \n \n\n The collective rights theory was formed on the grounds that since the Miller court ruled that in order for a weapon to be protected under the second ammendment it must be militarily useful, it follows that in order for a person to have protection under the second ammendment, they, too, would have to militarily useful, i.e a member of the organised militia. \n \n There are a few problems with this. first off, that is not how case law is established in the US, especially no when it comes to constitutional questions. Second, the miller court did not rule that a weapon had to be in active militaryily use in order to be protected, just that it had to be militarily usefull (useful in a military capacity).\n\n The possession and use of the weapon has to be related to a well regulated militia, not just the type of weapon. \"We note first that however clear the Court's suggestion that the firearm before it lacked the necessary military character, it did not state that such character alone would be sufficient to secure Second Amendment protection. In fact, the Miller Court assigned no special importance to the character of the weapon itself, but instead demanded a reasonable relationship between its 'possession or use' and militia related activity\"\n U.S. v.

   "First off, i'm not referring to collective rights and these things (that term isn't really familiar to me, as English isn't my first language). My point in this debate is nothing else than the 2nd amendmend being interpretable in more than just one way.\n How you apply it being interpretable in exactly one or more than one way to the collective rights thing is entirely your business, i don't care about that at all.\n \n \n \nPersonally, I think it is because supreme court justices are no longer simply judges who have a good knowledge of the law, they are also stooges, carefully screened by their respective political parties to ensure that they will dance to whatever beat that party is playing at any given moment. \n \n I have heard others expalin that this is beacuse they treasonous scum. i disagree, I think they ard just playing the political game that all our other politicians are playing.\n\n That might be an explaination of their reasons why they interpreted it that way. But this doesn't change the fact that it was being interpreted otherwise, and that this was kept up for 40 years.\n Even the SCOTUS cannot sustain a completely unviable interpretation of the constitution for 40 years. \n \n It simply happened - for my purpose this is pretty much the end of the story.\n \n Anyway, i understand that you might consider it unviable, but to a certain degree that is a matter of individual understanding of the language and not really debatable. \n \n jwu",

Halonen <halonen@csd.uwm.edu<\n The following are taken from the Oxford English Dictionary, and bracket in time the writing of the 2nd amendment:\n \n 1709: \"If a liberal Education has formed in us well-regulated Appetites and worthy Inclinations.\"\n \n 1714: \"The practice of all well-regulated courts of justice in the world.\"\n \n 1812: \"The equation of time ... is the adjustment of the difference of time as shown by a well-regulated clock and a true sun dial.\"\n \n 1848: \"A remissness for which I am sure every well-regulated person will blame the Mayor.\"\n \n 1862: \"It appeared to her well-regulated mind, like a clandestine proceeding.\"\n \n 1894: \"The newspaper, a never wanting adjunct to every well-regulated American embryo city.\"\n \n The phrase \"well-regulated\" was in common use long before 1789, and remained so for a century thereafter. It referred to the property of something being in proper working order. Something that was well-regulated was calibrated correctly, functioning as expected. Establishing government oversight of the people's arms was not only not the intent in using the phrase in the 2nd amendment, it was precisely to render the government powerless to do so that the founders wrote it.",

   "Yes it does. Consider these words of wisdom from Paul Finkleman: \"Consider, for example, the term 'people' in the First Amendment 'Congress shall make no law . . . prohibiting . . . the right of the people peaceably to assemble . . . . ' If it is hard to construe the word 'people' in the Fourth Amendment to be anything but a reference to individuals, it is equally difficult to construe the term in the First Amendment as anything but a collective right. Clearly, the idea of the people assembling contemplates a large number of people and not a single person assembling. Thus, linguistically, the term 'people' in the Second Amendment might be interpreted 'either way.' Standing alone, the phrase 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' could apply to individuals or collectively to 'the people.' But, unlike the use of the word in the Fourth Amendment, the Second Amendment ties the term 'people' to a collective entity, the 'well regulated Militia' which is 'necessary to the security of a free State.' This understanding is also supported by the original wording of the Amendment, which referred to the 'body' of the people. Linguistically, the Amendment can easily be read to concern the 'body'of the people. The Amendment does not say, 'individually armed citizens, being necessary to the security of a free state . . . . ' The Amendment explicitly refers to the 'militia,' a collective organization and a specific kind of militia at that one that is 'well regulated.' It is hard to imagine individuals being 'well regulated' by the government. They are only 'regulated' as a group.\"\n http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/FinkelmanChicago.htm\n So the plain language of the second amendment supports the collective rights theory. That's all the documentary evidence I need.\n\n \n Lets look at some other words of wisodome from Paul Finkleman (the guy who actually managed to loose a tenured position as a constitutional law professer).\n \n \nPaul Finkleman, who is a Professor of Law at the University of Tulsa, told the Chicago Tribune (Jan. 23, 2002) that Bellisles's book will remain an \"important contribution\" whatever the evidence proves. \"In the end,\" Finkleman said, \"I don't think it matters if he cooked the data.\" \n \n \n this is the same guy who BECAME a professor becasue he had a 0 wins out of 253 cases he tried in private practice (probably for saying stupid things like above). The problem here is that the firs ammendment, even in the section regarding the right to assemble, does in fact convey an individual right. We know this not only because the supreme court has ruled on it, but because individuals have cause for legal action when those rights are infringed (there are literally dozens fo first ammendment cases on the books, brought by indivuduals, regarding this issue).\n \n VOR, PLS, choose better sources. It is barely worth the time it takes to log on here when you are quoting people like Finkleman. A lot of us use E-mail alerts to know when there are new messages here, adn we only get one. Logging on just to see a message where somebody whose views are as ludicrous and widely discredited as Finklemans is a real pain. If words from Finkleman are all the documentation you need, you are a gullible person indeed.\n \n The first ammendment reads:\n \n \nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. \n \n \n An argument that \"the people\" in the first or second ammendment is an argument about original intent, which is clear inboth cases.\n \n \nThe possession and use of the weapon has to be related to a well regulated militia, not just the type of weapon. \"We note first that however clear the Court's suggestion that the firearm before it lacked the necessary military character, it did not state that such character alone would be sufficient to secure Second Amendment protection. In fact, the Miller Court assigned no special importance to the character of the weapon itself, but instead demanded a reasonable relationship between its 'possession or use' and militia related activity\"\n U.S. v. Rybar (1996\n\n \n Teh problem with this is that the Miller court DID specifically attach importanct to the charachter of the weapon itself. \n \n \nIn the absence of evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than 18 inches in length,' which is the subject of regulation and taxation by the National Firearms Act of June 26, 1934, has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well-regulated militia, it cannot be said the the Second Amendment to the Federal Constitution guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument, or that the statute violates such constitutional provision\n\n \n \n\"It is not within judicial notice that a shotgun having a barrel of less than 18 inches in length is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.\"\n\n \n The Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case back to the district court, giving the defendants a chance to provide evidence that a short-barrelled shotgun could contribute to \"the efficiency of a well-regulated militia.\" (The Court was apparently unaware of the use of short-barreled shotguns in trench warfare during World War I. [http://nraila.org/FactSheets.asp?FormMode=Detail&ID=17] ) \n \n Note, Miller only required evidence that the weapon contribute to the efficiency of a well-regulated militia. The Court never said the defendants had to belong to a well-regulated militia. In other words the Miller case interpreted the Second Amendment to mean one has the right to own militia type weapons. \n \n Hugo Black, one of the justices who decided Miller said:\n \n \nAlthough the Supreme Court has held this Amendment to include only arms necessary to a well-regulated militia, as so construed, its prohibition is absolute. (Black, Hugo, The Bill of Rights, New York University Law Review, Vol. 35, April 1960.) \n \n \n There is an article by Brannon Denning (A well respected and never debunked constitutional scholar, unlike Finkleman) available at http://www.guncite.com/journals/dencite.html that is well worth the read. It specifically discusses mis citings of the Miller case in order to attempt to turn our individual right into a collective one.",

   "Since Reverend Hellhound insists on using an antique definition of \"well-regulated\", I think it will be interesting to examine an antique definition of \"the people\". The founders defined \"the people\" rather narrowly. \n John Adams explained that women were not part of \"the people\" because \"nature has made them fittest for domestic cares\" and women were unfit for \"the great business of life, and the hardy enterprises of war, as well as the arduous cares of the state\". Servants and those who didn't own land were also not part of the people because they were \"too little acquainted with public affairs to form a right judgement, and too dependent upon other men to have a will of their own.\" (Works of Adams 9:375-378)\n\n \n \n What are you talking about?!?! The constitution was written in the late 1700's we HAVE to go by thier meaning not a modern interpretation, This is most silly.

Something will be in proper working order if it is being well regulated, but it doesn't make the two things one and the same.\n\n \n \n Here maybe this d00d can hel you out a bit...\n \n \n On the original meaning of the 2nd Amendment\n Henry E. Schaffer\n \n \"Whereas in all well regulated Governments, it is the indispensable duty\n of every Legislature to consult the Happiness of a rising Generation,\n and endeavour to fit them for an honorable Discharge of the Social\n Duties of Life, by paying the strictest attention to their Education.\"\n \n These resounding words were the opening of a November 12, 1789 Act of\n the North Carolina Legislature which was passed on December 11, 1789 and\n which chartered the University of North Carolina. Noting that this Act\n was contemporaneous with the Bill of Rights (which was transmitted to the\n state legislatures on September 25, 1789) and that the North Carolina\n Legislature was active at that time, North Carolina being one of the\n original 13 states, let us pay particular attention to the usage of the\n words \"well regulated\" found both in this Act and in the 2nd Amendment\n of the BoR. The use of \"well regulated\" in this act can shed some light\n on the meaning of the 2nd Amendment.\n \n The 2nd Amendment reads: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary\n to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and\n bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n \n The debate between the collectivist and the individualist\n interpretations of the 2nd has often focused on the meaning of \"well\n regulated\" in the opening phrase \"well regulated Militia\". The\n collectivists claim this this refers to a Militia which is tightly\n controlled by the government, deducing this from the etymology of\n \"regulated\" which relates to \"ruled\". However, this ignores the usage\n of the word \"regulate\" in which the \"rule\" refers to the proper\n operations of a device rather than to man-made laws. We still see this\n in the word \"regular\", which in many contexts means \"properly operating.\"\n \n Let me give two examples of usage of the word \"regulate\" which have\n been in existence for quite a long time and which have the same\n \"properly operating\" interpretation.\n \n 1) Horology: The adjustment of a portable timepiece so it will keep\n time in the different positions in which it may be carried and kept (and\n perhaps at the different temperatures which it may encounter.) A\n (mechanical) wrist-watch which has been so designed and adjusted is said\n to be \"regulated\" and likely has this word stamped or engraved on its\n back-plate.\n \n 2)Firearms: The adjustment of a multi-barrel firearm (e.g., a double\n barrelled shotgun) so that the barrels shoot to the same point-of-aim.\n If such a gun (a double-barrelled shotgun or a three barreled \"drilling\")\n fails to shoot properly, it is considered to be \"out of regulation\" and\n needs to be \"re-regulated\".\n \n Both of these uses have meanings *related* to the \"to rule\" of\n man-made laws, but are more in the nature of \"to adjust to or to be in\n a state of proper functioning\". So a \"well regulated watch\" or a \"well\n regulated double barreled shotgun\" both would have meaning of \"having\n been put into properly functioning condition\".\n \n From my reading of material from the colonial era, I have come to\n understand that \"well regulated militia\" had a meaning at that time\n (ca. 1789) in the nature of \"a properly functioning militia\" - which\n would mean something along the lines of a properly trained and equipped\n militia (since it was common at that time for militiamen to bring their\n own firearms, with which they were already proficient.)\n \n The language of the NC Legislature in 1789 strengthens this\n interpretation. What can \"well regulated Governments\" mean other\n than \"properly functioning Governments\"? Surely it didn't and\n couldn't refer to a government under the control of man-made laws, for\n it is the government itself which makes these laws, and it would neither\n be noble nor sensible for the Legislature to be proclaiming that it is\n controlling itself.\n \n An additional contemporaneous document which exhibits the same\n meaning is the Federalist Paper #29, in which Hamilton is discussing\n the composition of the militia and says, \"To oblige the great body of\n the yeomanry, and of the other classes of the citizens, to be under\n arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and\n evolutions, as often as might be necessary to_acquire_the_degree_of_\n perfection_which_would_entitle_them_to_the_character_of_a_\n well-regulated_militia, would be a real grievance to the people, and a\n serious public inconvenience and loss.\" (emphasis added)\n \n Note that \"well-regulated\" clearly refers to how well the militia\n functions and how well trained are the militia members. It does not\n refer at all to the degree to which the government controls the militia\n or the members of the militia.\n \n This interpretation is also borne out by some old or obsolete\n definitions in the Oxford English Dictionary. \"Regulated\" has an\n Obsolete definition (b) \"Of troops: Properly disciplined\" and then\n \"discipline\" has a definition (3b) applying to the military, \"Training\n in the practice of arms and military evolutions; drill. Formerly, more\n widely: Training or skill in military affairs generally; military skill\n and experience; the art of war.\"\n \n The \"people\" have the 2nd Amendment right, not the militia. Today\n many people make a large distinction between the two groups, perhaps\n confusing \"militia\" and \"Army\". The militia is more inclusive,\n including the Armed Forces, the National Guard and the unorganized\n component described in the U.S. Code as \"The militia of the United\n States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and,\n except [for felons], under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a\n declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States...\"\n The age and gender restrictions might be challenged as discriminatory.\n The historical basis for a more inclusive definition includes the U. S.\n Supreme Court statement that \"It is undoubtedly true that all citizens\n capable of bearing arms constitute the reserved militia force or\n reserve militia of the United States as well as the States; ...\" From\n this we see that the mention of the militia does not conflict with the\n individualist interpretation.\n \n Therefore I conclude that the meaning of the 2nd Amendment is, \"A\n properly functioning Militia is necessary to the security of a free\n State; therefore the (pre-existing) right of the people to keep and bear\n Arms shall not be infringed.\"\n \n References:\n \n Act of NC Legislature of Nov. 12, 1789 - Legislative Papers, H. of C.,\n 1789, AH.

   "Speaking of the 14th amendment, there is one scholar that says an individual right to own a gun came with the 14th amendment, not the second amendment.\n \"But, when the Constitution speaks of 'the people' rather than 'persons,' the collective connotation is primary. 'We the People' in the preamble do ordain and establish the Constitution as public citizens meeting together in conventions and acting in concert, not as private individuals pursuing our respective hobbies. The only other reference to 'the people' in the Philadelphia Constitution of 1787 appears a sentence away from the preamble, and here, too, the meaning is public and political, not private and individualistic. Every two years, 'the people'--that is, the voters--elect the House. To see the key distinction another way, recall that women in 1787 had the rights of 'persons' (such as freedom to worship and protections of privacy in their homes) but did not directly participate in the acts of 'the people'--they did not vote in constitutional conventions or for Congress, nor were they part of the militia/people at the heart of the Second Amendment. \n \n \"The rest of the Bill of Rights confirms this communitarian reading. The core of the First Amendment's assembly clause, which textually abuts the Second Amendment, is the right of 'the people'--in essence, voters--to 'assemble' in constitutional conventions and other political conclaves. So, too, the core rights retained and reserved to 'the people' in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments were rights of the people collectively to govern themselves democratically. The Fourth Amendment is trickier: 'The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.' Here, the collective 'people' wording is paired with more individualistic language of 'persons.' \n \n \n \"the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment strongly believed in an individual right to own and keep guns in one's home for self-protection. Most obviously, blacks and Unionists down South could not always count on the local police to keep white night-riders at bay. When guns were outlawed, only Klansmen would have guns. Thus, the Reconstruction Congress made quite clear that a right to keep a gun at home for self-protection was indeed a constitutional right--a true 'privilege' or 'immunity' of citizens. That's the good news for the NRA--with the even better news that, if the Court took this Reconstruction vision seriously, state and local governments would be limited along with federal officials. But the bad news, at least for the most ardent gun lovers, is that whatever Fourteenth Amendment right exists is a limited one. Virtually no one today is seriously arguing to take away all guns from homes. (And actually trying to do so would be a nightmare for anyone who cares about liberty and privacy, given that guns are stashed everywhere and may well outnumber people in America.) Instead, most proposals seek to regulate rather than prohibit--limiting the amount and type of ammunition, restricting the number of guns one can buy in a given week, and so on. Requiring registration of guns and even licenses with practical and book tests, on the model of licensing drivers, sends some gun lovers up the wall--the first step toward confiscation, they predict in dire tones. But this is hard to take seriously. The authors of the Second Amendment, after all, were perfectly comfortable knowing that the government would know who had guns--every voter--and also were perfectly comfortable requiring those who owned guns to be properly trained and monitored in their use. Realistic gun control today may not be exactly what the Framers had in mind when they said that the armed citizenry should be 'well regulated' But--at least in a world that is so distant from the Founders--it's close enough. \n \"\n http://www.constitution.org/2ll/2ndschol/103wha.htm",

But this is hard to take seriously.\n\n http://www.chronwatch.com/content/contentDisplay.asp?aid=6575 \n but there are people, elected offishals that are trying to do exactly that. \n \n \n\n Gun Control Means Confiscation\n \n ''If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn 'em all in, I would have done it.'' &#8211; Senator Dianne Feinstein, CBS-TV's 60 Minutes, February 5, 1995.\n\n This what we see, and you are trying to tell me that one of the driving forces behind the AWB is not trying to confiscate my weapons?\n \n \n GUN LAWS ARE FOR EVERYONE BUT ME \n Reckless Feinstein Sweeps Crowd with AK-47 \n The story U.S. Senator Feinstein was promoting at the anti-gun news conference made all the big papers and TV networks. But you had to be there to see the incident that stole the show. \n \n Senator Dianne Feinstein \n Forth Worth Star-Telegram columnist Jill Labbe wrote, &#8220;Guns (are) nowhere as dangerous as liberals who can&#8217;t handle them. There stood Dianne Feinstein, the anti-gun senator from California, posing for all the nation&#8217;s media to capture on Kodachrome, holding an AK-47 with her finger firmly planted on the trigger. Here&#8217;s a woman so concerned about the supposed recklessness of gun manufacturers&#8230;who wouldn&#8217;t know firearm safety if it bit her in the end of her upturned San Franciscan nose.&#8221; \n The reporters, dignitaries and innocent bystanders packed into the room were too ignorant to be terrified as Feinstein swept the crowd with the muzzle of the automatic rife, bold closed, finger on the trigger, high-capacity magazine locked in place. \n San Francisco resident William A. Levinson wrote a certified letter to Mayor Willie Brown, Jr., demanding legal action against the blatant gun safety violations of the illustrious &#8220;Ms. Gun Control,&#8221; who holds a rare California concealed weapons permit. \n When asked earlier why she carried that .38 Smith & Wesson concealed in her purse while promoting gun control for the rest of us, Feinstein answered, &#8220;I know the urge to arm yourself because that&#8217;s what I did. I was trained in firearms. I&#8217;d walk to the hospital when my husband was sick. I carried a concealed weapon. I made the determination that if somebody was going to try to take me out, I was going to take them with me.&#8221; \n Only a couple of months earlier, however, Feinstein has gone on 60 Minutes to announce, &#8220;If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an out-right ban&#8230;I would have done it.&#8221; \n\n http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a393009843f7b.htm \n I hear about how no body wants to take my weapons, but &#8220;Mr. and Mrs. America, turn 'em all in&#8221;, from a woman that carries a consoled weapon, is pretty straight forward.

The first clause is the justification clause. It presents a possible justification for the actionable clause, which is the second clause. The actionable clause is in no way dependant on the justification clause. It was no back then, and it is still not. You can argue as much as you like whether or not the justification presented actually IS rightous justification for the drastic action in the actionable clause (prevention of infringement on the right to keep and bear arms), but you cannot argue it the other way around, because (in case you missed it the first time) the actionable clause is NOT dependant on the justification clause.\n \n His second mistake is one of context. He has come to the conclusion that the phrase \"the people\" somehow refers to the people as some kind of collective, which it simply does not. The phrase \"the people\" refers to the people as a whole. this si true almost any time the phrase is used. In order to view the phrase \"the people\" as anything else, such as a specific group, a modifier MUST be added following the phrase. This is not a matter of interpetation, it is simply one of the idioms of the english language. We have examples of this going back hundreds of years, and we still see this today. Personally, I find it pretty tough to believe that a constitutional law professor is capable of making a mistake like this. It makes me wonder if maybe he is just trying to push an agenda here for those not bright enough to pick up on some pretty major mistakes, oversights, and fallacies.\n \n This paragraph pretty musch gives us the answer to that, and the answer is a resounding YES, we are just blowing smoke in an attempt to hide the fact that we are pushing a political agenda as opposed to having a meaningful discussion about hte second ammendment:\n \n \nThe rest of the Bill of Rights confirms this communitarian reading. The core of the First Amendment's assembly clause, which textually abuts the Second Amendment, is the right of \"the people\" - in essence, voters - to \"assemble\" in constitutional conventions and other political conclaves. So, too, the core rights retained and reserved to \"the people\" in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments were rights of the people collectively to govern themselves democratically. The Fourth Amendment is a bit trickier: \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\" Here, the collective \"people\" wording is paired with more individualistic language of \"persons.\" And these words obviously focus on the private domain, protecting individuals in their private homes more than in the public square. Why, then, did the Fourth use the words \"the people\" at all? Probably to highlight the role that jurors, acting collectively and representing the electorate, would play in deciding which searches were reasonable\n and how much to punish government officials who searched or seized improperly. An early draft of James Madison's amendment protecting jury rights helps make this linkage obvious and also resonates with the language of the Second Amendment: \"...The trial by jury, as one of the best securities to the rights of the people, ought to remain inviolate.\" n8 Note the obvious echoes here - \"security\" (Second Amendment), \"secure\" (Fourth Amendment), and \"securities\" (draft amendment); \"shall not be infringed,\" \"shall not be violated,\" and \"ought to remain inviolate\"; and, of course, \"the right of the people\" in all three places.\n\n \n Sorry if that comes out fromatted a little funny, it is from my local copy and was in PDF form. If you want to read some more by Amar, you can find it at http://islandia.law.yale.edu/amar/ .\n \n So, lets take this paragraph apart and see some of the other glaring errors here:\n \n \nThe rest of the Bill of Rights confirms this communitarian reading. The core of the First Amendment's assembly clause, which textually abuts the Second Amendment, is the right of \"the people\" - in essence, voters - to \"assemble\" in constitutional conventions and other political conclaves\n \n\n \n By this logic, people who wished to assemble for non political reasons could be prohibited from doing so. We know this is not the case. Implicit in the first ammendment is our right to free association. You have the right to associate with any individual, or any group you so desire, as long as in doing so you do not interfere with the rights of another. The government may not, becasue of the right of free association which is implicit in the right of assembely in the first ammendment, require people to belong to particular associations or groups. They also may not require any particular group to disclose the names of their members, as ther right of free association is a constitutional right and therefore you are protected form government interference or curiosity when taking advantage of that right. \n \n \nSo, too, the core rights retained and reserved to \"the people\" in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments were rights of the people collectively to govern themselves democratically.\n\n \n Thisis the same logical fallacy noted above, he is referring to the rights of \"the people\" in the 9th and 10th ammendments as some kind of vaugly defined collective right. This is not the way the english language works. Again, wihtout a qualifier, \"the people\" refers to the population as a whole, or every individual within the population.\n \n \nThe Fourth Amendment is a bit trickier: \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\" Here, the collective \"people\" wording is paired with more individualistic language of \"persons.\" And these words obviously focus on the private domain, protecting individuals in their private homes more than in the public square. \n\n \n Now, this is an INCREDIBLE stretch for a constitutional law professor to make. first, the text of the fourth ammendment:\n \n \nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. \n \n \n What they are referring to in the use of the word \"persons\" is your body. Every supreme court who has EVER ruled on the fourth ammendment has agreed on this. The fact that tehy used \"persons\" to refer to your body has nothing at all to do with whether this is an individual right or not, and he knows it. \"persons\" is being treated as a physical object which you own. the government cannot search or seize your body unless they have a warrant (or probable cause in some cases, but this is nto the time or place to get into that whole mess), nor can they search or seize your house, papers, or effects (everything else you own) without a warrant.\n \n the last line there, \"And these words obviously focus on the private domain, protecting individuals in their private homes more than in the public square.\" are also patently false, and as a constitutional scholar, he knows it. Your fourth ammendment rights are just as prevelant in a public square as they are at home. If this was a legitimate way to construe the constitution, then it would be entirely constitutional for any cop on any street in the country to grab any citizen they pleased and perform a body cavity search on them. This is obviosly NOT the case, and every supreme court that has ever ruled on this ammendment has agreed that your fourth ammendment right protect you wherever you are. This also help highlight the fallacy that the term \"persons\" is what makes this an individual right or, even more distressingly, \"focused on the private domain\". \n \n \nWhy, then, did the Fourth use the words \"the people\" at all? Probably to highlight the role that jurors, acting collectively and representing the electorate, would play in deciding which searches were reasonable and how much to punish government officials who searched or seized improperly. An early draft of James Madison's amendment protecting jury rights helps make this linkage obvious and also resonates with the language of the Second Amendment: \"...The trial by jury, as one of the best securities to the rights of the people, ought to remain inviolate.\" \n \n \n Or, more likely, because this article has no basis in constitutional law and instead is an article that he was hired to write by The New Republic, which is a liberal publication and makes no attempt to hide this fact (I subscribe to it myself....they sometimes joke abotu the fact that they are so liberal in the editorial section).\n \n We know why the fourth ammendment uses the phrase \"the people\". It is because it conveys a right to \"the people\", which is every individual in our society. Indeed, by the logic of the supreme court, which has ruled that the rights enumerated in the bill of rights were not created there, merely recognised officially, and predate the bill of right (they are basic, human rights), \"the people\" as outlined in the fourth amendment includes every person on earth (as is reflected in their recent decisions regarding the detainees at gitmo).\n \n I am also more than a little confused as to how Madisons amendment protecting juries rights is similar to the second amendment. The second amendment is written in a familiar form, well known and documented. His amendment regarding jury rights is simply not phrased using the same style. Thisis not a point of debate, any scholar of the english language, indeed, anybody who speaks it well should be able to tell you this.\n \n I am a little surprised that he brought up anything regarding earlier drafts of the bill of rights, particularly one that came from madison. you would think that he would have been concerned that Madisons earlier draft of the second ammendment would come to the mind of the reader.\n \n \nThe right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country; but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.\n\n \n This was shot down because people did not want exemptions to compulsory service based on religous prinicpals, as there was concern that pacifist religions would become very popular at times of war. \n \n the next draft of the amendment simply read \"The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\". That was it, nothing about the militia at all. This was deemed to be too short. So, we ended up adding a little bit more (a justification clause in front of the actionable clause). \n \n You may note a couple of things about the original wording of Madisons amendment. first, it has the same actionable and justification clauses that ended up being used in the final draft, but they are in reversed order. this is because, according to the grammatical conventions of the time, this is how you had to do it. The two clause ocnstruction was just that, a 2 clause construction. Sentence structure was different for more than 2 clauses. \n \n You might also note that in this draft, madison makes a distinction between being part of the militia, and rendering military service in person. It does not say that you can decide not to be a member of the militia based on religous principals, simply that you cannot be forced to render military military service in person. This highlights the fact that ib order to be part of the militia, you do not have to be activly providing military service (i.e a memebr of the military or national gaurd).",

   "Don't know if this helps or hurts, since the main body of the militia act was accurately cited earlier, but I have access to the USC, and here is a cut & past of the current militia act (last codified on 11/30/93):\n -------------------------------------\n 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 311 - Militia: composition and classes\n \n (a) The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard.\n \n (b) The classes of the militia are -\n \n (1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and\n \n (2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia.\n \n (Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 14; Pub. L. 85-861, Sec. 1(7), Sept. 2, 1958, 72 Stat. 1439; Pub. L. 103-160, div. A, title V, Sec. 524(a), Nov. 30, 1993, 107 Stat. 1656.)\n \n U.S. Code 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 311\n --------------------------------\n As I said, the last reinactment of this statute was done on 11/30/93. I have no idea whether any substantive changes were made from a previous version, but it would be interesting to note how the statute has evolved, if at all. \n ---------------------------\n \"False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. The ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.\"--Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting with approval 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria from his work, On Crimes and Punishment, 1764. emoticon_xgood",

   "\"EVERYBODY between 17 and 45\"? I think it says \"all able-bodied males\" between those ages. Jeffersonian should look at the current law and not rely on outdated laws.\n\n \n \n The equal rights ammendment extends membership in the militia to women as well as men (no brainer).\n \n Outdated? The current militia act was passed in 1956. Hardly outdated by legal standards.",
