   "I was just wondering if either of you were close to writing your posts listing some of the evidence in favor of creationism? It's getting very boring in here what with Gabor debating that gravity is a myth. We require real debate. We require the hard evidence that you both promised us so we can have a lively, reasonable debate, and so far we have heard nothing from Frog and Lappster just stopped by to give us his short but interesting review of Jurassic Park 3. Please post your messages soon.\n \n MQ",
