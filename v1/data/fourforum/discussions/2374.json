   "The Wall Street Journal 05/07/04\n author: Robert Block\n (Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n \n Under 9/11 Law, ATF Keeps Tabs on Propellant Buyers; Feds Visit Al's\n Hobby Shop\n \n ELMHURST, Ill.\n \n Al's Hobby Shop in this leafy corner of suburban Chicago is always\n packed with mothers looking for Cub Scout badges, teenagers ogling\n imported slot cars and grown men playing with model trains.\n \n But to federal law-enforcement officials, Al's is also a possible\n terrorist supply depot. And so, last October, a special agent from the\n Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was sent to Al's\n from Washington to buy $1,700 in model rocket motors.\n \n \"The guy told me that the government wanted to do some tests,\" recalls\n Tim Lehr, who sold the agent 40 motors containing almost 60 pounds of\n propellant. \"He wouldn't say what the tests were for, but I could guess:\n The government wanted to ruin my hobby.\"\n \n Since the passage of the initial post-9/11 antiterrorism laws in\n October 2001, hobby rocketry has been struggling to avoid regulation\n that enthusiasts say will destroy their sport, deter youngsters from\n pursuing an interest in science and waste the nation's limited\n law-enforcement resources. The Department of Justice says that federal\n agents need to keep an eye on who is buying model rockets because the\n toys are potentially dangerous and could be adapted by terrorists to\n attack airplanes and American soldiers.......\n See below for the rest of the aticle:\n http://www.emailthis.clickability.com/et/emailThis?clickMap=viewThis&etMailToID=1025191771&pt=Y\n \n This is a good example of government run amok. As a model rocketeer who has been involved in the hobby with my son for 10 years, there's not one shred of truth in classifying APCP solid rocket fuel as an explosive. If it is an explosive, how many Shuttle Astronauts would sit next to 2 Million pounds of the stuff on the launch pad?\n http://www1.msfc.nasa.gov/NEWSROOM/background/facts/shuttle_prop.pdf\n \n The two majore hobby organizations, the NAR and TRA, are in the process of suing the BATFE for misclassification and illegal rulemaking with respect to the propellants and hobby motors. The charge that the BATF misclassified APCP as an explosive was dismissed because the statute of limitations had expired on ctching the error in the original law. It seems that once a bad law has exceeded the statute of limitations without being caught, it can't be undone without an act of Congress.\n We have recently been granted a \"stay of execution\" by a Federal Judge who agreed with part of the lawsuit. He agreed that the BATF did engage in illegal rulemaking WRT model rocket motors.\n The whole BATFE argument boils down to an illogical fear that model rocket motors could be used by terrorists to shoot down an airplane or take out a tank. It is totally ridiculous. If a hobby rocketeer could build a rocket capable of taking out a plane or a tank, then why are we funding McDonald-Douglas and others to the tune of $10's of Billions annually for the development of weapons to do just that? If I could do it in my garage, where's our Defense money really going? \n emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Yeah, space shuttles do not explode, nor did any of the rockets we tested during the space race, some of which were solid fuel propelled... emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Careful now, your ignorance of the topic is beginning to show. In the first shuttle accident, the main liquid tank ruptured due to a stream of hot flame leaking from the infamous O-ring. If you watched the video closely you will see the two solid rocket boosters continuing to burn normally as the main tank and the shuttle disintegrate. In the case of the second shuttle accident, there weren't any solid rocket boosters present at the time of the accident.\n The military tested and has used a variety of solid propellants over the years, some of which are nitroglycerin based, for example. They need propellants that have rxtremely high initial thrust and almost invisible smoke trails. They aren't even remotely similar to what is used by model rocketeers.\n \n\n Take an estes rocket motor, the kind used for model rockets. why does it not explode?

Someone buying 80 cases, you might want to take a closer look at. Perhaps keeping an eye on sales of this type of product is not a bad idea, but not at the expense of a safe, enjoyable hobby.\n\n \n First, Estes rocket motors are made from black powder. Black powder IS an explosive. But, in the BATFE's infinite wisdom, anybody who has an antique firearm can keep up to 50 pounds of it in their house without any magazine OR LEUP (enough to level the house and then some). Why? Because the NRA got that exemption put into the original explosive regulations. So there's no need to worry about someone buying 80 cases of Estes motors to cut open and grind (not a good idea with black powder BTW) when they can buy the black powder loose in bulk already.\n The larger rocket motors that I'm referring to are the same composition as that used in the shuttle's SRBs. It is composite blend of ammonium perchlorate, a rubberry polymer and some burn modifiers like Aluminum and iron powders (usually referred to as APCP, ammonium perchlorate composite propellant). It isn't explosive and can't even be lit with a match. It requires a special high temperature pyrogen mixture to even light it. To demonstrate its safety, someone even made an APCP ashtray. \n emoticon_smile \n The BATF has, over the years, attempted to prove that it was an explosive but they failed miserably every time.
