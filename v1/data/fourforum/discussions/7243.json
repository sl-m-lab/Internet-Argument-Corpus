   "As so often seems to happen, scratch a CITHGAP, find a closet case (not to mention a hypocrite):\n \n \nOKLAHOMA CITY -- An executive committee member of the Southern Baptist Convention was arrested on a lewdness charge for propositioning a plainclothes policeman outside a hotel, police said.\n \n Lonnie Latham, senior pastor at South Tulsa Baptist Church, was booked into Oklahoma County Jail Tuesday night on a misdemeanor charge of offering to engage in an act of lewdness, police Capt. Jeffrey Becker said. Latham was released on $500 bail Wednesday afternoon.\n \n Latham, who has spoken out against homosexuality, asked the officer to join him in his hotel room for oral sex. Latham was arrested and his 2005 Mercedes automobile was impounded, Becker said.\n \n Calls to Latham at his church were not immediately returned Wednesday. \n \n When he left jail, he told Oklahoma City television station KFOR:\n \n \"I was set up. I was in the area pastoring to police.\"\n \n The arrest took place in the parking lot of the Habana Inn, which is in an area where the public has complained about male prostitutes flagging down cars, Becker said. The plainclothes officers was investigating these complaints.\n \n The lewdness charge carries a penalty of up to one year in jail and a $2,500 fine.\n \n Latham is one of four Southern Baptist Convention executive committee members from Oklahoma.\n \n He spoke out last year against a measure, ultimately approved by voters, to expand tribal gaming.\n \n He has also spoken out against same-sex marriage and in support of a Southern Baptist Convention directive urging its 42,000 churches to befriend gays and lesbians and try to convince them that they can become heterosexual \"if they accept Jesus Christ as their savior and reject their 'sinful, destructive lifestyle.\"'\n \n The Southern Baptist Convention is the nation's largest Protestant denomination.\n http://www.channeloklahoma.com/news/5845859/detail.html",

   "I found this facinating! I think the legal aspects brought up are worth debate:\n \n [quote-ex-gaywatch]\n http://www.exgaywatch.com/blog/index.html\n Southern Baptist Pastor Arrested for Gay Sex Offer\n \n The Recording Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Southern Baptist Church has been arrested for propositioning a male undercover officer for oral sex.\n \n The Oklahoma City police were conducting a sting operation to respond to complaints about male prostitution. The Rev. Lonnie Latham, pastor of the South Tulsa Baptist Church, was arrested after he invited an undercover policeman back to his room at the Habana Inn for oral sex. The charge was not prostitution or solicitation but rather offering to engage in an act of lewdness.\n \n At present there may be facts of the case that are not fully understood. However, it appears to me initially that without any suggestion of money taking place, the pastor was arrested for offering to engage in sex with another man.\n \n This raises concerns about the legality of the arrest, or even of the sting. After Lawrence v. Texas was decided by the Supreme Court, it is no longer allowed for any state to set up laws that make it illegal to offer to have sex with another man. Other laws against prostitution or public acts of lewdness can remain if they are applied equally. As the sex was to take place in private (a hotel room) and since no money was offered (as best we can tell) this may turn out to be an illegal arrest.\n \n Perhaps Oklahoma City may have some other facts or there may be exceptions to Lawrence of which I'm unaware. We will have to wait and see. However, I hope that Lambda Legal will recognize that Rev. Latham is as much a victim of discrimination - as he is a proponent of it - and will offer legal assistance.\n \n This situation, though sad, does highlight one significant problem with the ex-gay movement. It's reported that Latham also supported a Baptist Convention directive that encourages befriending homosexuals in an effort to persuade them to become heterosexual and reject their \"sinful, destructive lifestyle.\"\n \n Latham, it would seem, has fallen victim to his own rhetoric. He no doubt believed his church's teaching that there is no sexual orientation, just sin. That by rejecting or refusing a label of \"homosexual\" and by trying not to live a \"homosexual lifestyle\" he could overcome his sinful nature. It is both ironic and pathetic that his fight against his own intrinsic characteristics led him to a life that includes furtive sexual trysts in a sordid hotel and ultimately a criminal record.\n \n It is clear that Latham behaved as a hypocrite in his religious life. It will be interesting to see if he relies on the protections that have been won by gay advocates to protect him legally. Without efforts (which have been adamantly opposed by the Southern Baptist Church) sex between men would still be illegal in Oklahoma and Rev. Latham could be facing a possible jail term. I do not yet know if Latham spoke out against Lawrence or other legislation on which he can now rely, but if so it would make him doubly a hypocrite.\n \n I hope that through this, Rev. Latham can gain some introspection and take whatever steps are necessary to reconcile his sexual orientation (whatever it may be) with his life. However, based on the history of similar situations, it is likely that Latham will \"repent\" and disavow his \"sin\". He will lose respect, his position of leadership in the denomination, and possibly his church. But most sad, he will probably lose his chance to start over and stop fighting himself. Let's hope he doesn't.\n \n So far, though, the good reverend's position has been more laughable than laudable. He claims:\n \n As the Rev. Lonnie Latham, 59, left jail Wednesday, he said \"I was set up. I was in the area pastoring to police.\"\n \n I think that perhaps Rev. Lonnie meant that he was ministering to the needs of his fellow man.",

   "Stories like this seem to turn up with alarming frequency. \nA Brentwood man was arrested yesterday on charges of raping and sexually abusing two of his children over the course of five years.\n \n The 50-year-old man is being held at the Williamson County Jail in lieu of posting $500,000 bail. A court date had not been set yesterday.\n \n The two children, boys ages 12 and 16, have been removed from the home, according to police.\n \n The Tennessean does not identify victims of rape without their consent.\n \n Because the children have the same last name as the suspect, the newspaper is not identifying the defendant. The case, which was investigated by Brentwood Detective David O'Neil, was presented to a Williamson County grand jury on Monday. The grand jury returned a 10-count indictment, charging the defendant with eight counts of rape of a child, one count of rape and one could of aggravated sexual battery, District Attorney General Ron Davis said.\n \n The charges stem from incidents that allegedly occurred between September 2000 and December 2005.\n \n O'Neil said the defendant, who is married, has four other children - two of whom are adults.\n \n \"At this point we have no reason to believe there are any other victims,\" O'Neil said.\n \n Allegations of rape and abuse were brought forth by one of the victims, police said. On a mid-December day, a Brentwood patrol officer was called to the family's home to help resolve a domestic issue, O'Neil said. One of the boys told the officer that he and his brother had been abused.\n \n Attempts to reach the defendant's attorney were not successful. A male who answered the phone at the defendant's Brentwood home hung up on a reporter after asking, \"What is this regarding?\"\n \n The suspect is involved in the Christian book-publishing industry, according to police and numerous Web sites.\n \n Marita Littauer, president of CLASServices, a New Mexico-based company which coordinates Christian writers conferences, said she knew the defendant on a \"professional level.\"\n \n \"I seriously question the charges,\" Littauer said. \"I cannot believe they are accurate.\"\n \n Davis and O'Neil said few details would be released about the case because they do not want to identify the victims. \u0095\n\n \n http://tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060111/COUNTY09/601110410/1006/NEWS",

   "The leaders of the evangelical Christian Right are constantly attacking gay and lesbian Americans. One of their favorite stereotypes - championed by America's premier homophobe, Rev. Lou Sheldon and his Traditional Values Coalition - is that gays recruit people into homosexuality. Lou and the rest of the sanctimonious leaders of the Christian Right are also notorious for their claim that religion - specifically their dogmatic Protestant fundamentalism - will prevent or \"cure\" homosexuality.\n \n Pastor Lonnie Latham, a member of the executive committee of the Southern Baptist Convention, has spoken out vehemently against same-sex marriage and urged gays to reject their \"sinful, destructive lifestyle.\"\n \n On January 3, 2005, Pastor Latham was booked into Oklahoma County Jail after being arrested for soliciting an undercover male police officer to join him in his hotel room for oral sex. (Latham's 2005 Mercedes was also impounded. Apparently the business of religious deceit and bigotry is quite profitable.)\n \n According to a September 12, 2004 LA Times story, Paul Crouch, the president of Trinity Broadcasting Network, paid Enoch Lonnie Ford $425,000 in 1998 in exchange for his silence about an alleged homosexual affair they had had in 1996 at a TBN-owned cabin near Lake Arrowhead, California. Trinity Broadcasting Network claims to be the world's largest Christian media empire with 24-hour programming via 47 satellites and 12,500 affiliates reaching a total of 92,540,954 U.S. households. In true duplicitous fashion, a statement released on September 22, 2004 by TBN denied Crouch had had a homosexual affair, but confirmed the hush money paid to Ford.\n \n Hypocrites? You bet, and liars as well.\n \n Two books that have not received the widespread attention they deserve make the case, definitively.\n \n To try to briefly summarize Karen Armstrong's meticulously research 496-page book The History of God would be a gross injustice, but the reviews by Amazon.com and Publishers Weekly make the point. From Amazon.com:\n Armstrong, a British journalist and former nun, guides us along one of the most elusive and fascinating quests of all time - the search for God. Like all beloved historians, Armstrong entertains us with deft storytelling, astounding research, and makes us feel a greater appreciation for the present because we better understand our past. Be warned: A History of God is not a tidy linear history. Rather, we learn that the definition of God is constantly being repeated, altered, discarded, and resurrected through the ages, responding to its followers' practical concerns rather than to mystical mandates... [italics mine]\n From Publishers Weekly:\n This searching, profound comparative history of the three major monotheistic faiths fearlessly illuminates the sociopolitical ground in which religious ideas take root, blossom and mutate. Armstrong, a British broadcaster, commentator on religious affairs and former Roman Catholic nun, argues that Judaism, Christianity and Islam each developed the idea of a personal God, which has helped believers to mature as full human beings. Yet Armstrong also acknowledges that the idea of a personal God can be dangerous, encouraging us to judge, condemn and marginalize others. Recognizing this, each of the three monotheisms, in their different ways, developed a mystical tradition grounded in a realization that our human idea of God is merely a symbol of an ineffable reality. To Armstrong, modern, aggressively righteous fundamentalists of all three faiths represent \"a retreat from God.\" ... [italics mine]\n What's clear is that the concept of \"God\" is always evolving, and its intelligent designers are humans. What's also abundantly clear is that today's \"aggressively righteous fundamentalists of all three faiths represent 'a retreat from God'\" and an advocacy of deception, hypocrisy, hate, and self-interest. \n http://www.counterbias.com/512.html",

There are millions of christians who are against homosexuality. What you need to find in this case is what makes it different from all of those others. The difference is, this guy has made a career out of condemning the gay lifestyle in a public forum. I really think the fact that he is a christian is a moot point. If an atheist publically condemned gays on a regular basis and achieved the same level of notoriety, then got caught soliciting a cop for gay sex, I bet people would still be pointing out the hypocrisy.",

Or if Rush Limbaugh were to be caught illegally obtaining drugs after making a statement such as \"And so if people are violating the law by doing drugs, they ought to be accused and they ought to be convicted and they ought to be sent up.\" I can't stand the self-righteous. \n \n \n While both David Duke and Rush Limbaugh may very well claim to be Christians, that is not what they are known for. And, in the examples I use here, their Christian faith is not what Im claiming would be hypocritical. For David Duke it would be his racist views and for Rush, I guess, his societal political views.",

How is it not just an issue of gay rights? \n\n \n Well, here is what I see. A LOT of effort is put into saying bad things about Christians here. More than any other group. The response to this is usually something like \"because Christians do all the attacking\" or something to that effect. But I don't know any Christians who attack gays. To me, it's just not something I see much. So what would you expect me to think? Do you expect me to ignore my observations?\n \n \nAgreed.
