   "Jesus Christ, it was a hypothetical question he asked to a discussion panel to stimulate debate.\n \n\n \"For those of you who do, as a matter of principle, oppose war in any form, the idea of supporting a conscientious objector who's already been inducted [and] in his combat service in Iraq might have a certain appeal,\" he said. \"But let me ask you this: Would you render the same support to someone who hadn't conscientiously objected, but rather instead rolled a grenade under their line officer in order to neutralize the combat capacity of their unit?\"\n \n Later, in a question-and-answer period, Churchill was asked whether the trauma \"fragging\" inflicts on that officer's family back home should be considered, he responded: \"How do you feel about Adolf Eichmann's family?\" \n\n At least by what's quoted of him in this article he never said he condoned any such practice. He asked people if they would offer the same support to conscientious objector as they would to someone who killed their CO. He didn't say that he thought they should. He didn't say that's what HE would do. He just asked a hypothetical question for the love of Pete.\n \n But I will say this. This man is a dipshit. Look at that picture of him and tell me that man isn't a total douche. If he's so anti-war, what the hell is he doing in camo, a beret, and with a rifle? What a XXXXX. The thing is, all this stirring up of debate he's doing might end up being bad for his health.",
