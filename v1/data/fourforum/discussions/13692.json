   "Discussion of the education system invariably revolves around \"reform\" programs that fiddle at the edges, but few question the validity, usefulness or purpose of the education system as currently structured, at all.\n \n I would like to hear your views on whether \"fixing\" education is a matter of reform at all, or whether the public schools system is an inherently oppressive device.",

   "I've worked in and around the public schools of South Carolina for over 20 years. I don't know exactly what you mean by oppresive but I'll conclude you mean as stifling the actual education of many students. My title expresses my true knowledge of the schools in this state. IF you loved your kids, you'd do everthing in your power to get them OUT of the government/public skrewls. \n I find they're nothing but \"reprogramming camps\" for a pro-gov't/Big Brother mentality, basically undermining ALL parental authority. We entrust them with the next generation and the government schools, like pre-Nazi Germany, endoctrinate our kids into being good little Brown Shirts. \n \n Their form of \"discipline\" is more to enforce conformity and submission than to correct errant and antisocial/disruptive behavior. AND parents who oppose this ideology are marked (along with their kids) of being \"obstructionist\", Schools pound into kids \"relativity\". Everything is a shade of gray (nothing is really wrong..Nothing is really right)..\n \n Get your kids out of public schools!. Charter Schools are still government schools so don't be fooled. Be careful what private school you send them to as well..Better to home school OR form a co-op if you care about your kid's ability to \"think\" for themselves first and foremost. \n \n BTW, kids who are paddled between the ages of 2 and 6 were found to be happier and mentally healthier according to a worldwide study released 1/10/2009! Thought I'd throw that in..",
