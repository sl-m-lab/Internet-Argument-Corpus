The standoff at Waco, the NYPD shooting of Diallo, the FBI shooting at Ruby Ridge. While I don't believe that our government has sinister intentions, I do believe that if a civilian had pulled the trigger in a situation like Ruby ridge, or the Diallo shooting, then that citizen (or citizens in the case of Diallo) then jail time would be served. C'mon, shooting at a man 41 times (only hitting him 19) for reaching for his wallet, and the cops walk, but in the same city, a man defends himself with a handgun from a mugger in an elevator, and they charge him for possesion of a firearm? There is certainly a double standard that allows law enforcement to get away with more than civilians. Like I said before, I don't believe our government has sinister intentions, but there has yet to be a government anywhere that does not betray some of its citizens, and so a level of distrust is certainly appropriate when dealing with any government body, plan, or agent.",

I said that I don't support a gun ban, simply regulation, since there is regulation for ALL products on the market. Then you accuse me of being like every liberal that is conspiring to start an outright gun ban followed by a question about why I fear the people.\n Maybe you don't notice the contradiction there. You obviously don't trust liberals, perhaps even fear them, yet you say I'm wrong to fear the people, even though I don't.\n \n If you had read my first post correctly, you would have realized that I don't want the government to institute a ban. But at the same time I don't want people to have guns. But I don't think that the guns themselves are the problem. They are more a manifestation of the problems with society, so I government ban would not do anything. It would be more effective to eliminate those problems with society so that people would give up their guns voluntarily. But I'm obviously not sure how to do that right now.\n \n \nIt doesn't matter what you think, the second amendment is clear enough all by itself. Try reading the Constitution again.\n\n \n It doesn't matter, eh? Then why are you even debating me? Why are there gun control laws in place that haven't been ruled unconstitutional, since obviously the antigun position doesn't matter, and the second amendment is clear enough all by itself?\n \n No, the second amendment isn't exactly clear. I guess its clear if you conveniently leave out \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\" The key words there are well, regulated, and militia. You see, that first part is implying that the purpose of guns is for the militia and that this militia must be regulated. For who can regulate the militia, let's look to another part of the Constitution, Article 1, Section 8. This section states the powers of Congress. It says, \"To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.\" Wow isn't that interesting. So the Congress can regulate the people who own guns in the country, also known as the militia. Isn't that funny? Maybe that means that Congress can pass laws that will maybe regulate gun usage and give these laws a catchy title like \"gun control.\" You know what else it says in the Constitution: \"The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several states. (Article 2, Section 2)\" This means that the President can also control the gun owning members of this country just as he can control the military. It's not quite as clear cut an issue as you might think.",

Guns and drugs can both in such great ways affect others that they should be restricted for public use.\n\n \n I think it depends on the drug. I know a guy who went through detox for a $500/day cocaine habit. 2 years ago, he quite smoking. He claims that quitting smoking was MUCH more difficult than giving up coke. Yet, you don't see smokers knocking over convenience stores to support their habit. I think that biggest effect that we would observe from the legalization of marajuana would most likely be an increase in the sale of snack foods. \n \n AS far as guns go, I am still not convinced that guns in the hands of the public at large are dangerous. Guns in the hands of criminals are a nasty business. I believe a valid point was made here not too long ago about guns being heavily restricted in Haiti. THe revolutionaries seem to have plenty of them. There is also the question of Sierra Leone. Pls, do a search and get some infor on that one (I saw it first hand). \n \n In a nutshell, a civil war broke out, guns were outlawed for the population at large. The gurillas were being supported by certain foreign factions, but their supply lines were poorly designed. They used their ammo against the gevoernment forces, and used machettes and strong arm tactics against the population at large. The population was entirely defenseless. Take a look over on Amnesty Intl's web page, they have several reports on Sierra Leone, as well as some nice pictures of children whose arms have been hacked off, eyes put out with hot pokers, an interesting story about a 13 yr old girl who was raped to death in front of her family.\n \n I have seen enoguh of that kind of thing that I cannot sleep at night. This is why I am staunchly pro-gun. If there is one lesson that individuals can take from such things, it is that your government cannot protect you against domestic threats. Even when you are talking about small scale stuff like a prowler in the house, nationwide average police response time in a metropolitan area is 7 minutes! Seven minutes is s VERY long time when you are talking a life and death situation. \n \n Right now, the odds of a wide spread uprising in the United States is slim, as was it at the time our constitution was written. The second amendment was included in the constitution as insurance against a time when it is not so unlikely. The second amendment is the smoke detector of the bill of rights. You hope you never really need it, but yu keep it in good working order just to be sure.\n \n I generally don't fear my government, I sometimes fear my fellow man. This is the problem (as I percieve it) with the socialist doctorine. It assumes that human beings want to live together in a utopian society and everybody will be willing to pull their load for the greater good. History shows us that human beings are greedy, manipulative, blood thirsty species hiding under a thin veil of civility.",

Granted, I was in a bad part of town, but still, 3 people in the less that 30 minutes I was there. That is pathetic!\n \n So far, the cost on grey market guns is much lower. They are not subject to multiple markups, thea re not subject to regulation, and they are not sold by folks like gun dealers and weapons importers that are subject to high overhead.\n \n I have a friend in S Africa who was telling me once about a great source he had for K&K MP5-S (the silenced version of the famous MP5). He had found a guy that was selling used/refurbed versions for only a few hundred bucks. I told him \"I wish I could find a source like that\".\n \n 5 weeks later, a box arrived from south africa with a silenced MP5 and 10 magazines. THis was a fully automatic firearm which had passed through customs and been shipped right to my door. If I was a criminal, I would have, of course, just kept the thing. Since I am not a criminal, I torch cut the reciever to BATF specs.\n \n This is one of the (many) reasons I do not believe a firearms ban is the solution to any problem.

A white guy at 62nd and the paseo (kansas city missouri) driving a jag at 11:00 at night is definatly going to be a one time purchase (since if he made a habit of it he would most likely be killed).\n \n AS far as stolen cars, people buy them all the time and just don't know it. They are re-registered and resold. There was a big deal about 6 yrs ago in missouri because the attorney general of that state wanted to crack down on cars that had been stolen and re-titled. It turns out that her personal vehicle had been stolen and re-titled. She had no idea, the dealer she bought it from had no idea. Want to know where to buy a stolen car? Try a used car lot, no big deal.\n \n It would be a lot easier to smuggle a crate full of guns than is to smuggle a single on. Single packages are more heavily scrutinized than containers or large crates. I order a lot of stufff from overseas, and a lot of time I will get a small package that had been opened by customs. It is no big deal. They also X-ray small packages (so if you ever order film or radiation sensitive items from outside the US, make sure you have the shipper mark it clearly). I have yet to have a crate arrive that has been opened. They just don't do it, it costs too much to have thousands of crates searched. I the customs decleration says \"teddy bears\", that is good enough for them.\n \n It seems to me that the exact inverse of your scenario is probable. Since they are so easily imprted, and so cheap to purchase in ther countries, supply and demand would dictate that there would be a greater number of guns available at rock bottom prices. \n \n I think we would also see a major change in what types of firearms we see on the street. Currently, the most common firearm in the united states is shotguns. They are used for hunting almost everything. Next common is sporting rifles, followed by hadguns, \"assault weapons\", submachine guns, and last, machine guns. If you are going to go to the trouble of illegally importing weapons, why not just start with machine pistols and SMG's? There would be no reason to mess with sporting rifles or shotguns. You can buy a kalishnikov overseas for half the price of a deer rifle, and if they are all equally illegal, why not do it?\n \n The cun ban scenario seems to me like a good way to disarm victims, and arm criminals with military weapons. This has happened in other countries that have enacted gun bans (in fact this is EXACTLY what happened in Sierra Leone). I think in the future, the british are going to see this start to occur. These things take time to develope, though. When they first passed theri gun ban, crime dopped for the first year, and the anti gunners all went \"LOOK, IT WORKED!!\". It took a while for the criminals to change tactics in response to the new social situation. Now that some time has passed, we can look and see that it certainly has NOT worked. Somewhere on here there is a thread about arming british police officers. Ranking officials seem to think this is needed because of the rash of violent crimes in the UK. We can argue that this has nothing to do with their gun ban, but we both know differently. And that is the UK, which tends to have a much more reserved and nonviolent public than the US.",
