   "Australian Research Reveals Link between Abortion and Domestic Violence Against Women\n \n By Meg Jalsevac\n \n MELBOURNE, April 4, 2007 (LifeSiteNews.com) - New research out of La Trobe University in Australia has found a direct link between domestic violence and a woman's choice to kill her child through abortion. The conclusions of the study are similar to several previous studies on the same topic in different countries.\n \n The study, labeled the Australian Longitudinal Study of Women's Health, was carried out in an effort to reveal typical characteristics in Australian women who procure abortions. The authors were Angela Taft and Lyndsey Watson of the Mother and Child Health Research of La Trobe University and the full article is published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health.\n \n The study discovered that determining which women had suffered from domestic violence was the most accurate indicator of which women would choose to have an abortion. \n \n The Melbourne study looked at 9,683 young Australian women aged 22 to 27 and reported that those women who claimed to have had an abortion in their teens or early twenties were 3 times more likely to have suffered some form of abuse from their partner than those who did not report having had an abortion.\n \n The study also revealed that women in the same age demographic who sought an abortion were more likely to be from underprivileged backgrounds and coping with a low-income, inadequate education or little or no private health insurance.\n \n The La Trobe study confirmed past research analysis from comparable studies in Canada, Britain and the US which have determined similar links between domestic violence and abortion. \n \n The authors of the Australian study offered their opinion on possible causal factors to explain the telling research. \"Women experiencing violence and abuse can be subject to coercive sex and unprotected intercourse, leading to a higher rate of unplanned and unwanted pregnancies.\"\n \n However, a parallel British survey found that despite a high incidence of abuse only 2% of the women seeking abortion were pregnant as a result of rape. \n \n In concluding the Australian study, author Dr. Taft advised that in order to reduce abortion and teen pregnancy it would be first necessary to work to eradicate violence against women. \"The take home message is that if we want to reduce the rate of abortion and unwanted pregnancy in Australia, especially among teenagers, we need to reduce violence against women. Also healthcare providers and pregnancy counseling services should ask women seeking terminations about their experiences of partner abuse and if necessary, refer them to supportive agencies.\"\n \n As previously reported by LifeSiteNews.com, in the similar Canadian study, 1127 women completed a 65-item questionnaire at a hospital abortion facility in London, Ontario. The results showed that overall 20% had experienced physical abuse by a male partner, and 27% had a history of sexual abuse.\n \n Similar research in the US has shown that 31% of women seeking an abortion have experienced physical or sexual abuse at some time in their lives and, of these, more than half have witnessed domestic violence as children. The British study showed that the risk of domestic violence more than doubled during pregnancy.\n \n Pro-lifers have long purported a link between domestic violence and abortion - frequently suggesting that the link is also observed in reverse order to the above studies. They warn that abortion is recurrently known to lead to instances of domestic violence.\n \n According to the abortion awareness website, abortionfacts.com, \"It is no accident that the abortion rate and the domestic violence rate have risen almost side by side. Abortion tends to create feelings of anger, bitterness and resentment between partners. A woman who is self-destructive or suicidal, but afraid to deliberately harm herself, may be more likely to become involved with a violent man. She may feel unconsciously that she 'deserves to be punished' because of her abortion. Because her abortion has destroyed her self-esteem, she may think that she does not deserve a better relationship than the abusive one she is in.\" \n \n Read Previous LifeSiteNews.com coverage: \n \n Abortion and Domestic Violence Closely Linked Canadian Study Shows\n \n Lifesite",

Phillips \n From the Department of Family Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, Ont. \n \n Correspondence to: Dr. Susan Phillips, Department of Family Medicine, Queen's University, 220 Bagot St., Kingston ON K7L 5E9; phillip@post.queensu.ca\n \n Before 1989, in hospitals across Canada, groups of 3 physicians would meet once a week to read and consider stories of failure and remorse. No legal abortion could be performed in this country without such a committee's approval. For years I spent Friday mornings with a gynecologist and a psychiatrist in a small room at our downtown Toronto hospital, reviewing pleas for care from women whose histories were marked by sadness more than by irresponsibility. \n \n In 1988 the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the existing abortion law (section 287 of the Criminal Code) as unconstitutional. A woman who wishes to terminate a pregnancy is no longer required to obtain a committee's opinion that continuing the pregnancy would endanger her health or life. A paradoxical effect of the decriminalization of abortion is that there is no requirement for anyone to bear witness, as William Fisher and colleagues do in a study published in this issue1(see page 637), to stories of lives disrupted by violence. Although their findings are neither new nor unique, they merit reiteration. Of 1127 women who completed a 65-item self-report questionnaire at a hospital abortion service in London, Ont., 68% were undergoing a first abortion, 23% a second, and 9% a third or subsequent abortion. Overall, 20% had experienced physical abuse by a male partner, and 27% had a history of sexual abuse. The vast majority (90%) had used contraception sometime in their lives, and, of note, at the time of the current conception 60% were using condoms and 40% were using an oral contraceptive. Compared with women seeking a first abortion, repeat abortion seekers were older, and were more likely to have given birth and to have had a sexually transmitted disease in the past. They had more limited personal and financial resources and were more likely to have been victimized at some time in their lives. \n \n This study reinforces the consistent findings of 2 decades of international research. A recently published British survey found that among women seeking abortion, 35.1% had experienced intimate partner abuse at some time and 6.6% lived in fear. In the British sample, approximately 2% of therapeutic abortion requests may have followed forced intercourse.2 US data show that 40% of women who seek abortions report abuse and that these women are likely to cite relationship problems as the reason for requesting pregnancy termination.3 \n \n What is the nature of the association between victimization and unplanned pregnancy? Do women with a history of violence somehow become less responsible users of contraception, or do they become more likely to opt to protect future children from living in the disrupted or violent environments that they themselves face? Fisher and colleagues show that, in comparison with women seeking a first abortion, those requesting second or third procedures are more likely to be using contraception. They are not psychologically maladjusted and are not using therapeutic abortion as \"birth control.\" However, many are from challenging and disrupted family circumstances. US research has shown that 31% of women seeking an abortion have experienced physical or sexual abuse at some time in their lives and, of these, more than half have witnessed domestic violence as children.4 The authors of this research suggest that a history of victimization should be considered a risk factor for being abused when pregnant and imply that previous abuse has a demoralizing effect that increases susceptibility to further violence. There may also be some truth to the idea that women \"trapped\" in more traditional, passive feminine roles are less able to assert control over themselves and their lives. The current study by Fisher and colleagues links repeated abortions to a tendency to miss taking daily birth control pills, and also to an inability to extricate oneself from harm. Perhaps, given this, we should understand both a mother's desire not to saddle her child with the risks she faces and the decisive behaviour that the act of seeking a termination implies. \n \n Despite the comparatively greater history of victimization characteristic of women who request repeat terminations, the prevalence of violence against women is, in general, so great that differentiating rates of abuse among abortion seekers may be irrelevant. A British study found that the prevalence of abuse among women attending a family planning clinic was 33%.5 Women who were employed full time reported the highest rates, suggesting that victimization may be blind to income. In a general cross-sectional survey of American women, 55% had experienced some type of intimate partner violence and three-quarters of these reported physical or sexual abuse.6 An Australian study showed that 25% of women had been victims of physical or emotional abuse by their partners in the preceding year and that 28% had been sexually abused in childhood. Almost three-quarters had not disclosed their history to a physician, mostly because they had never been asked.7 A study of the prevalence of violence in the United Kingdom found that 41% of women surveyed had experienced violence, while the incidence within the preceding year was 17%. The risk of violence more than doubled during pregnancy. Eighty percent of those surveyed believed that physicians should screen for exposure to violence.8 \n \n All of these findings have numerous implications for medical practice. Among these is the need to understand that women often seek abortions as a last resort, when personal circumstances preclude safe and positive parenting. We also need to appreciate that the efficacy and effectiveness of the birth control pill differ from one another rather dramatically. The data gathered by Fisher and colleagues preclude calculating an effectiveness rate for oral contraceptives, as we do not know how many women in the catchment area studied had no pill failures. It is striking, however, that almost half of those seeking therapeutic abortions were current birth control pill users who, for whatever reason, missed taking a pill or two before conceiving. \n \n Finally, Fisher and colleagues recommend screening all women seeking abortions for a history of abuse. Given the prevalence of victimization among women in general, I would suggest that physicians, particularly those in family practice, emergency medicine and obstetrics and gynecology, screen all women for what could be defined as an epidemic. Whether such screening would change outcomes depends on the outcomes chosen. A study conducted in the UK found that women tended to favour screening, although most of their health care providers opposed it. Using outcome measures of decreased exposure to violence, improved quality of life and potential for harm, the authors concluded that, at present, screening for violence could not be justified.9 Although it may be true that trying to change a social problem and decrease exposure to violence by means of individual interventions in a physician's office is unrealistic, it is also true that the reluctance of caregivers to ask and hear about violence perpetuates its invisibility. Perhaps a more appropriate outcome measure to use in assessing the merits of screening for violence against women would be a better understanding of the symptoms with which patients present. \n \n Fisher and colleagues should be applauded for listening to the stories of women requesting abortions. Their careful research identifies an increased level of exposure to violence among women seeking repeat abortions and reminds us of the extent of victimization among our female patients. \n \n &#223; See related article page 637 \n \n \n Footnotes\n \n Competing interests: None declared. \n \n \n References\n \n \n Fisher WA, Singh SS, Shuper PA, Carey M, Otchet F, MacLean-Brine D, et al.

   "Here is the article again that I am referring to. If you could quote it and highlight where it says that abortion causes physical violence or where it is you all feel that the blame shift comes that would be immensely helpful. From what I can tell, the data describe a correlation and not a cause. the end of the article proposes that women who have abortions are screened for domestic violence/abuse. HOW IS THIS BAD?\n \n Huck - article below -\n \n Originally Posted by Canadian Medical Journal \n Violence and abortions: What's a doctor to do? \n Susan P. Phillips \n From the Department of Family Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, Ont. \n \n Correspondence to: Dr. Susan Phillips, Department of Family Medicine, Queen's University, 220 Bagot St., Kingston ON K7L 5E9; phillip@post.queensu.ca\n \n Before 1989, in hospitals across Canada, groups of 3 physicians would meet once a week to read and consider stories of failure and remorse. No legal abortion could be performed in this country without such a committee's approval. For years I spent Friday mornings with a gynecologist and a psychiatrist in a small room at our downtown Toronto hospital, reviewing pleas for care from women whose histories were marked by sadness more than by irresponsibility. \n \n In 1988 the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the existing abortion law (section 287 of the Criminal Code) as unconstitutional. A woman who wishes to terminate a pregnancy is no longer required to obtain a committee's opinion that continuing the pregnancy would endanger her health or life. A paradoxical effect of the decriminalization of abortion is that there is no requirement for anyone to bear witness, as William Fisher and colleagues do in a study published in this issue1(see page 637), to stories of lives disrupted by violence. Although their findings are neither new nor unique, they merit reiteration. Of 1127 women who completed a 65-item self-report questionnaire at a hospital abortion service in London, Ont., 68% were undergoing a first abortion, 23% a second, and 9% a third or subsequent abortion. Overall, 20% had experienced physical abuse by a male partner, and 27% had a history of sexual abuse. The vast majority (90%) had used contraception sometime in their lives, and, of note, at the time of the current conception 60% were using condoms and 40% were using an oral contraceptive. Compared with women seeking a first abortion, repeat abortion seekers were older, and were more likely to have given birth and to have had a sexually transmitted disease in the past. They had more limited personal and financial resources and were more likely to have been victimized at some time in their lives. \n \n This study reinforces the consistent findings of 2 decades of international research. A recently published British survey found that among women seeking abortion, 35.1% had experienced intimate partner abuse at some time and 6.6% lived in fear. In the British sample, approximately 2% of therapeutic abortion requests may have followed forced intercourse.2 US data show that 40% of women who seek abortions report abuse and that these women are likely to cite relationship problems as the reason for requesting pregnancy termination.3 \n \n What is the nature of the association between victimization and unplanned pregnancy? Do women with a history of violence somehow become less responsible users of contraception, or do they become more likely to opt to protect future children from living in the disrupted or violent environments that they themselves face? Fisher and colleagues show that, in comparison with women seeking a first abortion, those requesting second or third procedures are more likely to be using contraception. They are not psychologically maladjusted and are not using therapeutic abortion as \"birth control.\" However, many are from challenging and disrupted family circumstances. US research has shown that 31% of women seeking an abortion have experienced physical or sexual abuse at some time in their lives and, of these, more than half have witnessed domestic violence as children.4 The authors of this research suggest that a history of victimization should be considered a risk factor for being abused when pregnant and imply that previous abuse has a demoralizing effect that increases susceptibility to further violence. There may also be some truth to the idea that women \"trapped\" in more traditional, passive feminine roles are less able to assert control over themselves and their lives. The current study by Fisher and colleagues links repeated abortions to a tendency to miss taking daily birth control pills, and also to an inability to extricate oneself from harm. Perhaps, given this, we should understand both a mother's desire not to saddle her child with the risks she faces and the decisive behaviour that the act of seeking a termination implies. \n \n Despite the comparatively greater history of victimization characteristic of women who request repeat terminations, the prevalence of violence against women is, in general, so great that differentiating rates of abuse among abortion seekers may be irrelevant. A British study found that the prevalence of abuse among women attending a family planning clinic was 33%.5 Women who were employed full time reported the highest rates, suggesting that victimization may be blind to income. In a general cross-sectional survey of American women, 55% had experienced some type of intimate partner violence and three-quarters of these reported physical or sexual abuse.6 An Australian study showed that 25% of women had been victims of physical or emotional abuse by their partners in the preceding year and that 28% had been sexually abused in childhood. Almost three-quarters had not disclosed their history to a physician, mostly because they had never been asked.7 A study of the prevalence of violence in the United Kingdom found that 41% of women surveyed had experienced violence, while the incidence within the preceding year was 17%. The risk of violence more than doubled during pregnancy. Eighty percent of those surveyed believed that physicians should screen for exposure to violence.8 \n \n All of these findings have numerous implications for medical practice. Among these is the need to understand that women often seek abortions as a last resort, when personal circumstances preclude safe and positive parenting. We also need to appreciate that the efficacy and effectiveness of the birth control pill differ from one another rather dramatically. The data gathered by Fisher and colleagues preclude calculating an effectiveness rate for oral contraceptives, as we do not know how many women in the catchment area studied had no pill failures. It is striking, however, that almost half of those seeking therapeutic abortions were current birth control pill users who, for whatever reason, missed taking a pill or two before conceiving. \n \n Finally, Fisher and colleagues recommend screening all women seeking abortions for a history of abuse. Given the prevalence of victimization among women in general, I would suggest that physicians, particularly those in family practice, emergency medicine and obstetrics and gynecology, screen all women for what could be defined as an epidemic. Whether such screening would change outcomes depends on the outcomes chosen. A study conducted in the UK found that women tended to favour screening, although most of their health care providers opposed it. Using outcome measures of decreased exposure to violence, improved quality of life and potential for harm, the authors concluded that, at present, screening for violence could not be justified.9 Although it may be true that trying to change a social problem and decrease exposure to violence by means of individual interventions in a physician's office is unrealistic, it is also true that the reluctance of caregivers to ask and hear about violence perpetuates its invisibility. Perhaps a more appropriate outcome measure to use in assessing the merits of screening for violence against women would be a better understanding of the symptoms with which patients present. \n \n Fisher and colleagues should be applauded for listening to the stories of women requesting abortions. Their careful research identifies an increased level of exposure to violence among women seeking repeat abortions and reminds us of the extent of victimization among our female patients. \n \n \u00df See related article page 637 \n \n \n Footnotes\n \n Competing interests: None declared. \n \n \n References\n \n \n Fisher WA, Singh SS, Shuper PA, Carey M, Otchet F, MacLean-Brine D, et al.

   "I didn't post the article. \n \n I mentioned how it made me feel, which someone else agreed with, which you have further substantiated by your comments, showing that one who reads the article can see that there are underlying assertations of blame shifting. Why show evidence when now three people can see it? I don't have any interest in petty debate arguments. \n \n The article does not mention a thing about men being responsible for the violence. It suggests that women, post-abortion and dealing with those issues, by whatever twisting psychological methods, are. \n \n I want it clear to any woman dealing with domestic violence, who has had an abortion, who happens to read this, to know that she is not, nor is her psychological condition, in any way to blame for violence perpetrated against her.\n \n Thanks, Huck. emoticon_xangel I always appreciate sincere comments.\n\n \n The going back and forth about who should prove what was getting a bit old. \n \n You can feel how ever your want from reading the article but it wasn't the study and was just an article on the study. \n \n Your view certainly doesn't disprove or prove anything with regard to the findings.

   "Here is the article again that I am referring to. If you could quote it and highlight where it says that abortion causes physical violence or where it is you all feel that the blame shift comes that would be immensely helpful. From what I can tell, the data describe a correlation and not a cause. the end of the article proposes that women who have abortions are screened for domestic violence/abuse. HOW IS THIS BAD?\n <snip article<\n\n \n I think the problem here is that we are getting our articles mixed up. This is in fact the article that I posted from the Canadian medical journal which talks about the study done. My problem is with the articles Archangel linked to on the pro-life site. The one quoted by you here seems very unbiased and a good summary (really it has to be since it is in a peer-reviewed journal)\n \n Here are the problems I have with that article, not the one you posted:\n \n \n Pro-lifers have long purported a link between domestic violence and abortion - frequently suggesting that the link is also observed in reverse order to the above studies. They warn that abortion is recurrently known to lead to instances of domestic violence. \n \n According to the abortion awareness website, abortionfacts.com, \"It is no accident that the abortion rate and the domestic violence rate have risen almost side by side. Abortion tends to create feelings of anger, bitterness and resentment between partners. A woman who is self-destructive or suicidal, but afraid to deliberately harm herself, may be more likely to become involved with a violent man. She may feel unconsciously that she 'deserves to be punished' because of her abortion. Because her abortion has destroyed her self-esteem, she may think that she does not deserve a better relationship than the abusive one she is in.\" \n \n\n \n Bolded parts cause me some problems, but the bolded and underlined parts are the ones that I have a problem with (felt like vomiting after I first read this garbage).\n \n \n If you are honest (and I believe you are - I think we just were referring to different articles), you will agree that this kind of unsubstantiated garbage (in fact opposite to the observed facts) will do nothing good for women, only harm them. I think this is the article Bell was referring to as well.",

   "I appreciate your position. Let me be clear on my position. Men are responsible for domestic violence they commit against women period. We can try to work on the men who do this and also put them in prison. However this would only be a part of a \"good\" societal response. The other part is to help women not be \"as susceptible\" to such things by assisting them with their self esteem. If we can educate a woman and convince her that she is truly valuable regardless of what the sleezbag that has been beating her is telling her then it is more likely the sleazebag will go to prison and she will not find herself in another similar relationship.\n \n Again, I do nto deny the responsibility, I merely recognize the scope of the problem is not so simple as to say \"jail the men\".\n \n Thanks again for your time.\n \n Jito: Your comments are always welcome and I am more than willing to accept constructive criticism of something I post. If you feel I am wrong on something, please, speak your mind. I can always listen to another NBA fanemoticon_xhoho\n\n \n I understand, and I agree 100% with what you've said here, Huck.

   "Actually this is something that this choicer has been well aware of. I have long had addressing poverty issues and domestic violence on my lists of ways that could reduce abortion.\n \n The bit about \"seeking out an abusive mate because they secretly feel they deserve it\" is a bit hard to swallow though. Usually an abuser reveals himself as such after the woman is in love, committed, etc. I do believe that there is a cycle to it, though. If abuse is what you know, what you grew up with, than you are more likely to have it in your adult life - but I don't buy that women purposely seek it out.\n\n Sidenote:\n Well, it's not so much a conscious thing.\n There is an odd, dysfunctional chemistry that seems to attract abusers and abusees before anyone \"reveals\" themselves.",
