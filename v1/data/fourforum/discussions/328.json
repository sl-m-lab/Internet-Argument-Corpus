   "After four North Koreans fighters intercepted a United States spy plane on Sunday, the U.S. has decided to take it up a notch and send 24 Bombers to Guam. This is meant to demonstrate our willingness to hold true to our efforts to combat this Axis of Evil. We have abandoned the policy of appeasing dictators, converting to a more realistic method to deal with nuclear blackmailers.\n \n source: VOA News\n \n The move made by North Koreans, on Sunday, mimicks a similar incident that occurred in early 2001 with the Chinese. In that incident an EP-3 Navy surveillance bird was clipped in international airspace, and was forced to land in China. Diplomatic relations with China was severely damaged, because of their conduct. They refused to hand the vehicle, which was initially in international airspace back over to the U.S. without first determining the specs needed to reverse engineer the \"bird\". In addition, they demanded an apology from President Bush for the life lost by the pilot who deliberately caused the collision. Stories have indicated that Sunday's incident also occurred in international airspace, meaning the North Koreans are again flaunting their blatant disregard for international law.\n \n source: BBC News\n \n This isn't the first such incident with an asset of this type. In fact, the Soviets accidentally shot down Korean Airlines flight 007 mistaking it for a surveillance bird similar to the one that was harassed on Sunday. In that incident a Korean airliner strayed off-course in the direction of a Soviet missile sight. The Russians scrambled a jet to identify it. A signal was given to the pilots of the airliner to land. When that failed to get the attention of the commercial airline, the pilot shot it down. Here is a transcript of the conversation the Soviet pilot had with his control tower:\n \n \"The target is military. As soon as it has violated state borders, destroy it. Arm your weapons . . . . The target has violated the state border. Destroy the target.\"\n \n Source: The Washington Post\n \n Of course, the Soviets were confusing flight 007 as the type of surveillance gathering plane hassled by both the Chinese, and the North Koreans. Luckily, for our teams of engineers on those flights, these newer incidents have not ended in tragedy. The purpose they serve is vital to our national security. Hopefully, all the data they risked their lives to get has been of some use in our fight against global state sponsored terrorism, especially in detailing the threat level of the North Koreans at this time.",

   "24 B-52 bombers. Those can do alot of damgae. I wonder if we sent F-18 Super Hornets up around N.Korea if they would try to do that stunt flying around those, probably not as I am sure they dont want to get shot down. \n \n I believe though that the N.Koreans learned from the Chinese when thier fighter hit our plane. Their pilot \"Wrong Way\" was killed.",
