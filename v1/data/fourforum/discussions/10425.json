   "Can the love between two people ever be an abomination? Is the chasm separating gays and lesbians and Christianity too wide to cross? Is the Bible an excuse to hate?\n \n Winner of the Audience Award for Best Documentary at the Seattle International Film Festival, Dan Karslake's provocative, entertaining documentary brilliantly reconciles homosexuality and Biblical scripture, and in the process reveals that Church-sanctioned anti-gay bias is based almost solely upon a significant (and often malicious) misinterpretation of the Bible. As the film notes, most Christians live their lives today without feeling obliged to kill anyone who works on the Sabbath or eats shrimp (as a literal reading of scripture dictates).\n \n Through the experiences of five very normal, very Christian, very American families -- including those of former House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt and Episcopalian Bishop Gene Robinson -- we discover how insightful people of faith handle the realization of having a gay child. Informed by such respected voices as Bishop Desmond Tutu, Harvard's Peter Gomes, Orthodox Rabbi Steve Greenberg and Reverend Jimmy Creech, FOR THE BIBLE TELLS ME SO offers healing, clarity and understanding to anyone caught in the crosshairs of scripture and sexual identity. \n \n http://www.forthebibletellsmeso.org/film.htm",

   "It's always good to have a rare reminder that not all Christians are gay-bashers:\n \n Episcopal Bishops Reject Anglican Church's Orders\n \n \nNEW ORLEANS, Sept. 25 - Bishops of the Episcopal Church on Tuesday rejected demands by leaders of the worldwide Anglican Communion to roll back the church's liberal stance on homosexuality, increasing the possibility of fracture within the communion and the Episcopal Church itself.\n \n After nearly a week of talks at their semiannual meeting in New Orleans, the House of Bishops adopted a resolution that defied a directive by the Anglican Communion's regional leaders, or primates, to change several church policies regarding the place of gay men and lesbians in their church. But the bishops also expressed a desire to remain part of the communion, and they appeared to be trying to stake out a middle ground that would allow them to do so. [Full Statement]\n \n \n It's a pity the third world Anglican church is so primitive in its homophobic religiosity, but at least we know it's not Christianity itself that's to blame. It's fundamentalism.",

Another cafateria Christer.\nIMNSHO, anyone who condemns homosexuality by quoting Leviticus should first be obliged to provide a list of the Levitical admonitions they themselves adhere to. I assure you, it would be so short as to not even qualify as a \"list\" at all. Oh, and if any of them actually care to read Leviticus--<gasp!<--beyond their favorite man-not-laying-with-another-man one, they'll find there's a lengthy list of horrible punishments for ignoring a single one of those many rules.\n \n So looks like we'll all meet in hell, buddy.emoticon_xbouncer",
