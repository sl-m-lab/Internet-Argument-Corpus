Think of the disproportionately high salaries of CEOs in the US - disproportionate to any other CEO salaries around the world. Do you seriously think that American CEOs are so brilliant at their jobs that they deserve salaries that are many times greater than their contemporaries abroad? They would like you to think so. It is especially frustrating to see failed CEOs get \"golden parachutes\" despite their failure. In comparison, many CEOs of troubled companies in Japan voluntarily take pay cuts.\n \n With most jobs, salaries are kept down by competition - in that, no matter how skilled and brilliant, employees who are not on the highest management levels can still be told to accept the salary they are offered or leave. There seems to be much less of a merit competition among top managers and CEOs. Loyalty, internal politics, and ability to manipulate others often are much stronger determining factors in upper management promotion than actual merit in decision making and business skills. Once in positions of power, it is also much harder to dislodge underperforming CEOs, and pre-negotiated contracts often leave poor performing CEOs with hefty salaries and bonuses or with \"golden parachutes\". \n \n Certainly, besides all the mediocre and poor CEOs and financial managers that are wealthy, there are many who do deserve their wealth and are admired by society (the Bill Gates of the world, etc.) However, it is largely the undeserving (such as all of those who have put the US economy at risk with their irresponsible financial dealings) that cause the resentment of wealth that is reflected in many sections of this society.",

   "Another opinion", 
   "...but it is the same money that has already been taxed. It is not earned income.\n\n It doesn't matter if it is earned or not, it is income. Interest income is not earned either. Besides, it is not new income to the dead person that the dead person is being taxed for. It is new income to the beneficiary that the beneficiary is being taxed for (that he never got taxed for before). \n \n Money circulates in our economy many ways and gets taxed in many ways along the way. The corporation that might employ you gets taxed on its revenues; part of those revenues come to you as a salary which you get taxed for; when you purchase things with that salary you get taxed again; if you hire someone to fix your roof or babysit your kid, they will get taxed for that same money; and so on and so on. The US taxes income and it taxes purchases. However, people do not pay taxes twice on the same income. This is also true for inheritance income. In the case of inheritance, the beneficiary is the one who is taxed on that inheritance income and that income tax only happens once. \n \nAs I said, it is merely an ideal situation that I propose...that CEOs not be offered anything other than a fixed salary.\n\n Unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal world so we have to make provisions to make sure that the most critical of our ideals are actually realized. Since corporations often do not police themselves in their behavior, government regulations exist to do just that. If you are arguing that market forces can acheive this, then you have to state specifically HOW. Otherwise, you will have to admit that you have no idea how or whether market forces can control corporate salaries. When I don't see a solution in the market, I generally turn to government solutions and will keep to this opinion until I hear someone come up with an actual market solution, not idealism.\n -------on edit------\n Rereading some of your posts, I noticed a discrepancy regarding this issue that I would like to ask you about<b></b>:\n In post 14, you wrote: \"As much as I detest overpayment of jocks, actors, rock stars, CEOs and filthy-rich televangelists, I believe their pay should be restrained by the market only. \", while in post 16 you admit that \"There is no method short of multi-faceted government intervention and regulation of corporate structure that will solve this problem.\". So, if you admit that it is only government that can solve this problem then why don't you let it? Or am I not interpreting you correctly, since I have been taking your first statement as absolute that you don't want government regulation of corporate salaries...\n --------------------\n \n I don't know what burger flippers earn in either country. My belief is that wages for all jobs should be set by the market value of each job. That is why unskilled labor should and currently does make less per hour than skilled labor. An auto mechanic should make more than a garbage collector because of the skills required to perform the work. \n\n I agree. However, how does one calculate that worth? Is a CEO, even those who make poor decisions, worth 500 times more than a desk clerk? I would say no. Some might be - ex. those that turn their company around to great profitability while minimizing damage (layoffs, etc) deserve their multi-millions. Most don't.\n \nNot necessarily so. If the consumption tax is at a level sufficient to generate the same amount of revenue, there is no need to reduce the military. I certainly favor a smaller government. Socialism is ALL government. ALL working people would be working for the government because the government would own everything.\n \n Also, if we went to a flat income tax, a rate will exist at which the revenue is the same as it is under our progressive tax. I don't favor a flat income tax either. I'm just pointing out that a progressive income tax is not required to maintain a certain revenue to the treasury. A consumption tax or a flat income tax could do the same.\n\n The only way I would favor a flat tax income (flat percentage, not flat amount) would be if there was a realistic subtraction for cost of living - say $40,000. \n \n The great majority of the government revenue currently comes from the upper middle class and above. Indeed, the top 5% of taxpayers pay more than 50% of the total taxes, while they make just over 30% of total income. The top half of taxpayers pay over 94% of total taxes. (at least as of the 2002 statistics that I found at Who Pays the Most Income Tax? ). If one were to suddenly switch to no income tax, or even to flat tax, then the poor and middle class would have to pay SIGNIFICANTLY more than they do now in order to maintain the same government revenue. Most would not be able to afford it. If you were to drop the social programs (including the largest revenue users such as social security and medicare) and keep only military, then their taxes would still rise while you would have on your hands a VERY unhappy populations whose old-age security just got taken away. All of these considerations are why no major mainstream politicians will touch the idea, just as no major mainstream politicians will seriously touch truly socialist ideas - they are too far out in the extremes.",

Didn't the USA invaded the USSR? \n \n Why Socialism? By Albert Einstein\n \n The boys of Capital, they also chortle in their martinis about the death of socialism. The word has been banned from polite conversation. And they hope that no one will notice that every socialist experiment of any significance in the twentieth century -- without exception -- has either been crushed, overthrown, or invaded, or corrupted, perverted, subverted, or destabilized, or otherwise had life made impossible for it, by the United States. Not one socialist government or movement -- from the Russian Revolution to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, from Communist China to the FMLN in Salvador -- not one was permitted to rise or fall solely on its own merits; not one was left secure enough to drop its guard against the all-powerful enemy abroad and freely and fully relax control at home.\n It's as if the Wright brothers' first experiments with flying machines all failed because the automobile interests sabotaged each test flight. And then the good and god-fearing folk of the world looked upon this, took notice of the consequences, nodded their collective heads wisely, and intoned solemnly: Man shall never fly. \n \n Introduction\n \n Killing Hope: US Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II",

Germany is NOT part of Scandanavia.\n 2. Sweden\n \n\n Political Debates Around Immigration \n \n With national elections set for September 2006, several immigration-related debates beyond structural discrimination are taking place. \n \n In 2005, attention was brought to the way in which immigration authorities deport asylum-seeking families whose young children exhibit what psychiatrists call pervasive refusal syndrome (a profound and pervasive refusal to eat, drink, talk, walk, and engage in any form of self-care). Deporting these families goes against the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Sweden has ratified. \n \n Beyond these types of deportations, the country's exceptionally restrictive immigration and asylum policies have been criticized by the Red Cross, Save the Children, and the Swedish Church. Together with Swedish Pen (an organization of writers, authors, and journalists who defend the freedom of the press) these organizations hosted a \"tribunal\" in the fall of 2005 to shift public opinion toward more open policies. \n The current Social Democratic government's restrictive approach is meant to appease anti-immigrant opinion with the goal of preventing the rise of a popular protest party with anti-immigration politics as its principal platform. Yet the government must balance this with the political support it depends on from the Green Party and the Left Party, both of which disdain the ongoing erosion of humanitarian asylum and refugee policies. \n Migration Information Source - Sweden: Restrictive Immigration Policy and Multiculturalism \n\n \n Sweden is always in my EU business update website refusing to allow Eastern European laborers into the country for fear of them driving socialist wages down.",

   "I agree with you that communism / socialism is highly unlikely to work in this country. However, you have not addressed my post concerning the fact that much of the wealth that is accrued in this country is not accrued because of superior merit but because of either inherited priviledge or non-merit based manipulation of financial systems. In other words, though there are some that certainly earned their wealth and deserve it, many or most of the wealthy are not wealthy because they deserve to be so by some extraordinary effort or brilliance on their part. Bad financial managers such as those who misused investment and mortgage funds, leading to a destabilized US economy, are just the most extreme examples of such undeserving rich. \n \n Given that we both agree that capitalism is superior to communism / socialism as an economic growth engine, how much regulation, if any, would you agree to in order to help control the very disproportionate and unjustified (often independent of merit) growth of the top-end salaries in industry?\n\n \n What is your problem with people handing down to their children, or anyone else they decide to bequeath their fortunes to, the property they own? Are you so criminal-minded that you would have the government rob them of their personal possessions at the point of a gun in order to \"redistribute\" it to the lower-classes who are not as ambitious as they? Why do you want to live in a society where the government is powerful enough to commit such an atrocity against its own people, especially the people who are the main support of said government? Are you a long-time, dedicated Marxist, or did you just get out of school, where you were taught that all this \"redistribution\" is a good thing?\n \n It takes a very simplistic mind to think that what has failed in EVERY place it has been tried will miraculously work in another place, just because you have been instructed to think that way. Psychologists agree that one sure sign of mental illness is to keep doing the same thing over and over with the same results. Our capitalist system has proven itself to be the best for the past two centuries, and people all over the world risk death or imprisonment to get here and realize the \"American Dream,\" so how can any decent person with no desire to imbed a Marxist government into the last, great nation on earth, suggest such a completely moronic, insane, sophomoric idea?",

But Thain wasn't the only one handing our checks last year.\n \n While 2008 was a devastating time for investors, 79% of Wall Street workers received bonuses, according to a study by employment Web site efinancialcareers.com.\n Study Says 80% Of Wall Street Got 2008 Bonus - Forbes.com \n\n \n This year, the public bailed out the banks that caused the economy to tank and we're paying the huge bonuses to the very folks that caused the economy to tank last year. If that doesn't prove that the rich are, at least, smarter than the middle class, then what does?\n \n \n\n The Economist: Bonuses? That's rather bad form ...\n Especially so given the subsidies big banks receive. Here's a way to fix things:\n \n By FROM THE ECONOMIST \n \n Last update: October 22, 2009 - 8:49 PM\n \n The answer is not more government intervention\n the answer is to let the the free market deal with their failure by running them out of business. It is a mistake to spend taxpayer money ... read more on private business bailouts. The federal government has no enumerated right to do this. You need these flushouts because it makes the survivors stronger and more reliable. Government bailouts have simply allowed the problem to continue.\n Watching an industry committing political suicide is ugly. That is what investment banks are doing by paying bumper bonuses a year after they were saved by state intervention.\n \n Goldman Sachs is set to award staff a near record $20 billion this year. Firms making losses for shareholders, such as Citigroup and Bank of America, are still paying hefty bonuses.\n Such rewards, in the face of public protest, feed the impression that banks are victims of what some call \"employee capture.\" The top 10 investment banks (as of the start of 2008) made an average return on equity of just 8 percent between 1999 and 2008. Four made cumulative losses. Staff got four times as much as shareholders did in profits.\n \n Normally, that would be a problem for shareholders alone. But Merrill and many others got bailed out by government. The new bonuses make a mockery of banks' claim that higher equity buffers are too expensive to contemplate. Some governments still own stakes in banks, so decisions on pay are directly theirs.\n \n Worst of all, bonuses are being paid in part from subsidies. This is not a free market, but a perversion of it.\n The Economist: Bonuses? That's rather bad form ... | StarTribune.com \n",
