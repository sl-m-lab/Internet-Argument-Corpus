   "Old News........Everyone already knows that Gardner is the only one who actually served on the \"same\" boat with Kerry that has negative things to say about Kerry.\n \n \nEqually shocking, the book reveals what Kerry did after his unusually short tour of duty.\n\n This quote from the very popular book \"Unfit for Command\" doesn't tell the rest of the story.\n \n Why don't they mention the term Kerry served before he \"asked\" for a Swift Boat command? Febuary 1966 to March 1969 appears to be a bit more than a \"short tour of duty\" to me.\n \n http://www.mojones.com/news/update/2004/02/02_400.html",
