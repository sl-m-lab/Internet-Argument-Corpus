   "Supreme Court upholds warrantless search of apartment based on marijuana smell\n \n By Eric W. Dolan\n Monday, May 16th, 2011 -- 8:19 pm\n Print 173\n \n \n Police find illegal drugs after busting into wrong apartment complex\n \n The smell of marijuana smoke and sound of evidence being destroyed is enough reason for police to knock down an apartment door and search the place without a warrant, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday.\n \n In an 8-1 decision [PDF], the nation's highest court said the warrantless search of an apartment in Lexington, Kentucky was legal because of \"exigent circumstances,\" which permits law enforcement officers to conduct a warrantless search if there is a strong likelihood of destruction of evidence.\n \n In the case Kentucky v. King, uniformed Lexington police officers pursued a suspected drug dealer to an apartment complex. The officers approached an apartment door where they believed the suspect had entered, knocked loudly and announced their presence.\n \n The officers said they could smell marijuana smoke and heard noises consistent with the destruction of evidence after knocking.\n \n The officers then kicked in the apartment door -- which turned out to be the wrong apartment -- and entered, finding marijuana and powder cocaine in plain sight and finding additional evidence during a second search.\n \n Lexington police officers eventually entered another apartment in the complex where they found the initial target of their investigation.\n \n The Supreme Court of Kentucky had ruled that the initial search of the apartment was not allowed under the exigent-circumstances rule because the officers should have foreseen that knocking on the door would prompt the occupants to attempt to destroy evidence. The court said the officers could not \"deliberately create the exigent circumstances with the bad faith intent to avoid the warrant requirement.\"\n \n The Supreme Court of the United States ruled there was no evidence that the police had acted in \"bad faith\" and that the smell of marijuana and the noises created inside the apartment were sufficient to establish that evidence was being destroyed.\n \n \"Where, as here, the police did not create the exigency by engaging or threatening to engage in conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment, warrantless entry to prevent the destruction of evidence is reasonable and thus allowed,\" Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote for the majority.\n \n \"Because the officers in this case did not violate or threaten to violate the Fourth Amendment prior to the exigency, we hold that the exigency justified the warrantless search of the apartment,\" the Supreme Court ruled, reversing the decision of the Kentucky Supreme Court.\n \n \"The court today arms the police with a way routinely to dishonor the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement in drug cases,\" Justice Ruth B. Ginsburg wrote in her lone dissent. \"In lieu of presenting their evidence to a neutral magistrate, police officers may now knock, listen, then break the door down, nevermind that they had ample time to obtain a warrant.\"\n\n \n \n I guess what I find most troubling about this case is that the supreme court ruled in favor of the officers 8-1. Not only does this ruling fly in the face of the 4th amendment, it leaves the decision up to the officers whether they want to obtain a warrant or not. It's very hard to prove that the cops at your door didn't smell pot before bursting in and searching your home without a warrant. And even if they did smell marijuana, am I the only one that's troubled that we're throwing out a major part of our bill of rights in order to catch people who are not only doing a drug that has proven to be less harmful than alcohol, but we're persecuting them while they're doing it inside the confines of their own home and harming no one else?",

I've pulled a general definition for exigency from Wikipedia:\n \n \nAn exigent circumstance, in the American law of criminal procedure, allows law enforcement to enter a structure without a warrant, or if they have a \"knock and announce\" warrant, without knocking and waiting for refusal under certain circumstances. It must be a situation where people are in imminent danger, evidence faces imminent destruction, or a suspect will escape.\n\n \n An exigent circumstance only exists if probable cause has been established.

Otherwise, they cannot obtain a warrant.\n \n In this case an undercover police officer watched a suspected drug dealer make an exchange and enter into one of two apartments. He notified uniformed police officers who investigated the area and noticed the smell of marijuana coming from one of the apartments. This combined with the fact a suspected drug dealer is believed to be located in one of the apartments provides the police with probable cause.

But that is not what this case was about. King's response did not question whether the exigency existed only whether the police created the exigency. In other words he is saying, \"If the police hadn't knocked on my door I wouldn't have had to destroy the abundance of coke and marijuana on my table.\"\n \n The court ruled that the police knocking on your door is not an indication of their attempt to violate your rights and thus responding as if they were is not appropriate.\n \n I'm inclined to agree.",

I couldn't believe that the Supreme Court would rule in favor of violating the fourth amendment by such a landslide without a legitimate reason.

So, fears of abuse are not unfounded. But for majority of people who are not criminals (or at least very good at covering their tracks) this ruling will have no effect.

   "I'm confident that probable cause was established in this case. A suspected drug dealer made an exchange with an undercover cop. The cop saw the suspect enter one of two adjacent properties.

   "What does destroying evidence sound like? Flushing a toilet, turning on the faucet? Maybe they tried to smoke it all in one great bong hit and they heard the bubble bubble sound.

They lost their suspect and started going door to door. They had no clue where he went, if they did they would have not gone into the wrong apartment and they would not have knocked. \n \n They had to have entered pretty quick to bust in after knocking saying police waiting for a response and then listening long enough to hear something they said sounded like destruction of evidence only to find drugs sitting out in the open. What did they try and destroy it with The Jedi Mind Trick\nIt was not disputed what \"sounds of destruction of evidence\" are. It seems law enforcement have a pretty good idea of what those sounds are and none of the judges are questioning this. The only question is whether or not destruction of evidence is an exigent circumstance. There is a long standing tradition that it is. \n \n Your facts are also a little off. They didn't go \"door to door\" as you suggest. They knew it was one of two doors since they were following the suspect. Given the circumstances it wasn't unreasonable to think the smell of an illegal drug may be coming from the drug dealer suspect's place. They knocked and announced that they were police officers.

The Kentucky Supreme Court held that the exigent circumstances rule does not apply in the case at hand because the police should have foreseen that their conduct would prompt the occupants to attempt to destroy evidence.

I still do not see how this ruling set a more dangerous precedent.\n \n Please correct me if I'm wrong but I'll restate my understanding of this issue.\n \n The exigent circumstance rule applies in very specific situations.

The Kentucky v. King case brought in front of the U.S. Supreme Court was regarding this clause. The Supreme Court ruled that in order to prove that the police created an exigent circumstance you must show that they intended to cause one of the above mentioned situations through their conduct.\n \n The exigent circumstance was always to be determined by the police.

What does it look like? What does it sound like? How does one determine whether someone is danger of being harmed? Does screaming alone offer enough evidence?

So, by knocking on the door they created the exigent Circumstance. If they smelled pot before they knocked they should have foreseen that knocking and announcing themselves as police officers would most certainly cause the people inside to hide or destroy the pot. \n \n The Precedent that I think it sets is that Police can simply walk up to your door and if they decide they want to search your house all they have to do is claim they smelled drugs, or they heard what they thought was destroying evidence.

I look at what is a slow shift towards greater and greater police power. Terry v Ohio turned probable cause into reasonable suspicion which gives police greater latitude to stop and search someone. If they find nothing oops sorry be on your way, if they do then they have probable cause based on what they found.\n \n What your saying is the Police decide if they have enough circumstantial or whatever type of evidence that in their opinion they would be able to get a warrant. If they think they do and then again at their discretion determine whether evasion, destruction or harm is happening without anything to protect innocent people. \n \n This case is easy to say well he had drugs what is the problem, they didn't bust down the door of someone who was innocent. Which in part is why I think this got before the Supreme Court, Had a blind guy who panicked at hearing the police on the other side of his door there would be no charges against the police and the guy would have to hire at his expense a lawyer and go after the police in a civil trial. This would never happen unless it could be proven he actually suffered something compensable. \n \n Like I said it is a slow shift of more power and authority being given to the police to make decisions and broader discretion on the reasoning behind those choices that I see becoming a problem. \n \n Citizens only have the protections afforded them by what the courts are willing to permit and if you look at the number of civil lawsuits that are brought against police and the payouts then factor in how many don't have the means or desire to initiate legal proceedings I have to ask how does giving them more autonomy work for everyone?",

   "This is where I believe they got the ruling wrong. As you said, the police cannot simply walk up to your door and enter just because they smell something they believe is Pot. They also said that the suspect they were chasing entered one of two apartments. Based on that alone I doubt any judge would have issued a warrant. Which apartment should he issue the warrant for? they couldn't just issue a warrant unless they knew which apartment they were going to search. So, by knocking on the door they created the exigent Circumstance. If they smelled pot before they knocked they should have foreseen that knocking and announcing themselves as police officers would most certainly cause the people inside to hide or destroy the pot. \n \n The Precedent that I think it sets is that Police can simply walk up to your door and if they decide they want to search your house all they have to do is claim they smelled drugs, or they heard what they thought was destroying evidence. The Supreme court just gave them the go ahead to abuse this by overturning the Lower court decision.\n\n \n I agree completely. They were primed to bust down that door and they aren't nitwits who were surprised that the house reeking of pot would have sounds of people scrambling around. They announced themselves to get a reaction. If they think their perp is the house why announce themselves? The only time I know of when they do is right before the break down a door. If they were selling raffle tickets would the noise triggered the thought or create the sense that immediate action was necessary. The cops know the rule and they know how people will react in a given situation.",

   "I guess what I find most troubling about this case is that the supreme court ruled in favor of the officers 8-1. Not only does this ruling fly in the face of the 4th amendment, it leaves the decision up to the officers whether they want to obtain a warrant or not. It's very hard to prove that the cops at your door didn't smell pot before bursting in and searching your home without a warrant. And even if they did smell marijuana, am I the only one that's troubled that we're throwing out a major part of our bill of rights in order to catch people who are not only doing a drug that has proven to be less harmful than alcohol, but we're persecuting them while they're doing it inside the confines of their own home and harming no one else?\n\n \n Its insane. Its hypocritical. Its expensive. End the 'War'.",

   "Alright, I've reviewed the syllabus and opinions of the court, as well as all the facts that I could find regarding this case. I still do not see how this ruling set a more dangerous precedent.\n \n Please correct me if I'm wrong but I'll restate my understanding of this issue.\n \n The exigent circumstance rule applies in very specific situations. Police must first establish enough probable cause to obtain a warrant. At which point they are to determine whether taking the time to obtain a warrant would result in A.) a suspect escaping, B.) a person being harmed or C.) evidence being destroyed and therefore immediate action is required. If any these situations are discovered then the police are permitted to enter the premises without a warrant. If none of the situations are present and immediate action is not required then the police must still obtain a warrant.\n \n A clause was added to the rule stating that if the police created the exigent circumstance then their warrantless entry is unjust. The Kentucky v. King case brought in front of the U.S. Supreme Court was regarding this clause. The Supreme Court ruled that in order to prove that the police created an exigent circumstance you must show that they intended to cause one of the above mentioned situations through their conduct.\n \n The exigent circumstance was always to be determined by the police. They did not gain the ability through this ruling. They already had it. And this ruling did not expand it simply because the case had absolutely nothing to do with whether the police can determine an exigent circumstance but whether they created one. \n \n The problem and potential for abuse lies in the fact that there were never any guidelines established to determine and identify these specific circumstances.\n \n How does one determine whether a suspect is trying to escape? What does it look like? What does it sound like? How does one determine whether someone is danger of being harmed? Does screaming alone offer enough evidence? Or do you have to witness someone being beaten before getting involved? Can you get involved prior to someone being harmed? What does destruction of evidence sound like? What does it look like? How many of the 5 senses must be utilized to properly identify an exigent circumstance. Which ones?\n \n Now, we all may have opinions on the above questions. But there is no official answer to any of them. And this ruling did not change that.\n \n But it is important to remember and take comfort in the fact that all of this is dependent on whether the police can establish enough probable cause to obtain a warrant. If the police does not have enough information to obtain a warrant exigence does not apply. They cannot walk up to your door smell pot and enter as smelling weed is not sufficient evidence to establish probable cause. And I would question any judge willing to execute a warrant simply on the grounds of smell.\n\n \n As I said before, I believe it should be dealt with on a case by case basis. If the police are entering without a warrant because they believe someone is in immediate physical danger, the rules should be slightly lax. However if the police are entering without a warrant in order to catch someone committing a victimless crime that causes no immediate danger to persons or property, then the rules must be extremely strict in order to discourage the police from abusing their power. As it stands, a simple scent and \"sounds\" that indicate the destruction of evidence coming from a general area where there was more than one house somehow nullified the need for a warrant.\n \n \n In my opinion, the police should not have this power at all when it comes to non violent, victimless \"crimes\", simply because there is no need for it.",
