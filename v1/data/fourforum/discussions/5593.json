   "It looks like a couple of insurgency groups are ready to give up the fight in Iraq..........This is the beginning of the end for the insurgents and great news for Iraq and the USA and terrible news for those who want to see us fail there......\n \n http://kitsapsun.com/bsun/nw_international/article/0,2403,BSUN_19092_\n \n nsurgents May Be Ready to Talk\n \n By Jonathan Finer, The Washington Post\n June 8, 2005\n \n BAGHDAD, Iraq A former minister in Iraq's interim government said Tuesday that the leaders of two insurgent groups were prepared to discuss conditions for ending their campaign of attacks.\n \n Aiham Alsammarae, who was electricity minister under the former government of Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, said the groups, which he identified as the Islamic Army in Iraq and the Mujaheddin Army, were willing to enter negotiations with U.S. and Iraqi officials.\n \n \n He said he initiated a dialogue with the groups and had held at least 10 meetings with their leaders over the past four months in his Baghdad home.\n \n \"We told them, if you keep shooting without saying what you demand, you are going to be always a target,\" he said in an interview. \"Now the government can sit with them and see what they need. If they want to deal with the security situation, this is a chance.\"\n \n Alsammarae's account of the reconciliation talks could not be independently verified. He said he had broached the subject with U.S. officials here and in Washington during a visit there last month, as well as with the Iraqi government.\n \n \"We've met with him in the past, and we welcome any Iraqi who wants to encourage dialogue and political participation and reconciliation in Iraq and who promotes the concept of rejecting violence as a political tool,\" said a U.S. Embassy official in Baghdad who spoke on the condition he not be named. \"This is a matter to be discussed with the Iraqi transitional government.\"\n \n Laith Kubba, a spokesman for Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari, said that in recent months the government had made preliminary contact with representatives of some insurgent groups. But he said he was unaware of Alsammarae's proposal. \"I have not heard from him or any group he represents,\" Kubba said.\n \n A Sunni Muslim and a citizen of both Iraq and the United States, where he attended college and spent several years in exile in the 1990s, Alsammarae said he now leads a new, predominantly Sunni political group called the Iraqi National Council Front.\n \n The insurgency is believed to be made up largely of Iraq's Sunni Arab minority. Alsammarae said he focused his reconciliation efforts on Iraqi-led insurgent groups, rather than foreign Arab fighters such as Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian who leads al-Qaida in Iraq.\n \n Asked what the insurgent groups wanted, he said their demands would include a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops and steps to reduce the influence of neighboring Iran, whose Shiite Muslim-led government has close ties to Iraq's new leaders.",

The US trhen provided a new list.\n \n Feb, 1995, the UN inspectors announced they had completed the new list and had found no undelcalred weapons (there were some weapons that Iraq had declared to ebgin with which were tagged for destruction). The US gave yet another new list including a list of documents they wished the Iraqs to turn over. Less than 2% of the documents on the list were in any way realted to weapons or weapon production.\n \n Mar, 1995, the head of UN inspections compained to the UN that they were having trouble completing their inspections becuase the US had staffed the inspection team entirely with CIA agents, and they wqere so busy spying that they were not getting any inspecitons done.\n \n This went on....the UN team constantly reporitng no violations and constantly complaining about the fact that we were using the inspections as an ecuse to spy until 1997. In 1997, Iraq expelled all US members of the inspection teams, citing the factt hat they were pretty much all a bunch of spies. \n \n In 1999, UNSCOM was replaced by UNMOVIC. By that point, inspoection teams ahd declared Iraq WMD free 11 times. We just added more to the list each time.\n \n When we finally went to war, the UN team asked for 2 more weeks to finish their work. At that point they were literally inspecting garden sheds and outhouses. They apparently believed that if they finished, the whole thing would be over, becuase they would have inspected pretty much the entire coutnry. There was simpy no place left to look.
