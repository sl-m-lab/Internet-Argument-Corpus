   "Ah, good old war-torn Ireland and Northern Ireland and their bloody, never-ending religious wars. If their stupid internecine blood-shedding were not enough, what about the niggling religious values they espouse, which enable the following behavior:\n \nGovernment Is in Peril as Scandal Rocks Ulster \n The sex scandal that has transfixed Northern Ireland in recent days has a cinematic echo: a 60-year-old Mrs. Robinson who was caught in an affair with a man who was 19 at the time, and is now at the center of a scandal that threatens to bring down the power-sharing government that has steered the province out of 30 years of sectarian bloodshed....\n\n Government Is in Peril as Scandal Rocks Ulster - NYTimes.com\n \n Mrs. Robinson is the wife of the first minister of Northern Ireland and it happens that the naughty lady is a stinkin' hypocrite:\n \nBut the storyline unfolding in Belfast has a more serious edge because this Mrs. Robinson, Iris, a stridently moralistic lawmaker, is the wife of the province's unionist first minister, Peter Robinson, who is now struggling to keep his job. \n\n Isn't that always the case?\n \n That's for the Protestant side of the story. Now for the Catholic side of the story:\n \nJust as the unionists have been damaged by the revelations about Mrs. Robinson's affair, republicans have been struggling to absorb recent disclosures by Gerry Adams, their pre-eminent political figure, of a history of sexual abuse within his family. Those include episodes of pedophilia by his late father - a republican icon - and investigations of a brother accused of molesting his own daughter.\n \n The shock of the revelations about the family lives of the Adamses and the Robinsons has hit especially hard because Northern Ireland remains a world apart from Britain and the Irish Republic, with their more laissez-faire social and sexual attitudes. With the recent decades of violence across the province entrenching many people in their faiths, Catholics and Protestants alike have hewed to the sterner moral codes of an earlier age. Politicians flouting those codes have done so at their peril.\n\n Ah, infidelity, pedophilia, incest! The stuff of Christian life.",

A government that brutally represses dissent and executed over 100,000 political prisoners out of a population of just 6.3 million is unlikely to be above falsifying its official statistics in order to improve its image. That was certainly common practice in other communist societies, including those which Castro used as models for his own.\n \n When the Iron Curtain fell in Eastern Europe, scholars rapidly determined that official Soviet and East European statistics were routinely falsified to burnish the communist regimes' public image. As this foolishly credulous 1973 Time article noted, official East German stats indicated that, by 1970, East Germany had a higher standard of living than Italy and was rapidly closing in on Britain. Anybody with even the slightest familiarity with actual East German living standards knows how far such communist claims were from reality.\n \n Obama is a socialist but cannot come right out and say so. He must cloak his deceit in &#8216;democracy&#8217;, much like Hillary had to do with her Hillarycare, back in the Clinton administration. That is before We The People wised up on what she was doing behind closed doors and threw her out on her behind. \n \n Obama must be dry heaving over some of his socialist supporters and the display of their lack of brain power and intellect. He must be popping aspirin every time one of these clueless opens their mouths and reveals what they&#8217;re actually all about and their socialists leanings. The racial &#8220;healer&#8221; must be taking antacid intravenously every time these clueless socialists openly voice their anti-capitalist, anti-constitutional, anti-wealth positions. The &#8220;Audacity of Hope&#8221; author must be chain smoking cigarettes every time one of his communist/socialist/anarchist czars is exposed by Fox News and pundits. Suggestion to President Obama: stop repaying debts and start leading our nation, stop being an idealogue and start representing ALL citizens. Stop trying to tank the economy to create a situation where we&#8217;re in &#8220;crisis&#8221; and need of government intervention, and get rid of the clueless you have around you that don&#8217;t have a clue what the rest of America is actually thinking about the whole thing.

AIDS is not a \"gay\" disease Easy. \n \n So why don't you do us all a favor and go fornicate some more by ejaculating all over revelation. It's your favorite past time anyways, can't just wait for that fire and brim stone can ya?\n\n \n AIDS was originally born out of the homosexual community of the 70s and early 80s Bath House culture and was initially spread through illicit sex from within that community. That REALITY is a historically undeniable FACT. Here, educate yourself since this isn't my opinion but is confirmed by the doctors who were their at the time.\n \n Now, as a public health officer, were you surprised at the idea of an epidemic breaking out within the gay community, or was this actually an accident waiting to happen?\n \n ... Sexually transmitted diseases were very significant in the gay community in San Francisco. When I arrived here in 1977, the City Clinic, which is primarily a sexually transmitted disease or STD clinic, was packed to the gills. You could barely get in the door. There were not only new infections but repeated infections, so sexually transmitted diseases were something that the Health Department and the gay community were working together on long before I got here in 1977.\n \n It was not surprising that something could have occurred as a sexually transmitted disease. However, gonorrhea, syphilis, most of the diseases that we see generally today are not killers. There was something different here. This wasn't just a sexually transmitted disease; this was a killer sexually transmitted disease.\n \n Tell me about Cleve Jones.\n \n Cleve and I were friends, and Cleve was a good person for me to bounce things off. He at that time was administrative assistant to Art Agnos, who at that time was an assemblyman [for San Francisco]. [He] was actually the first in the country to get legislation passed through the state legislature that was helpful to the fight against AIDS.\n \n Cleve and I would talk, and Cleve, among others, was always saying: \"I think the bathhouses are a problem. We really ought to do something with that.\" One day Cleve called me up and he says, \"I can't defend [you] if you close the bathhouses.\" I said: \"How can you say that? You've always said that you wanted them closed.\" He said: \"I did and I do, but if you, the director of health in the most liberal-appearing city in the country, do this, think of the impact that's going to have on less tolerant communities. We'll see an implementation of the sodomy laws, passage of laws; we'll see things against gays that we have never witnessed before, or have witnessed before but don't want to witness again.\" That argument, which was rampant through the gay community, was something that took most proponents and made them opponents.\n \n Even before Cleve did that, I was trying to work with the gay community to close the bathhouses, or at least to, quote, \"clean them up\" so that they wouldn't facilitate the spread of HIV and AIDS. In the early years before I got to San Francisco, there were several gay bars that had only one exit, which of course is a fire hazard. If the fire is between you and that exit, you can't go out. People were starting to demand that they put a second exit in. They weren't listening. They then sat in front of the bar with a fire door and a desk right out there, and within days there was a second exit. In these days, I figured if they could do that, maybe I could get them to help me close the bathhouses, or get the bathhouse owners to change the way in which bathhouses operate. I tried for years, and I failed, and I acknowledge that I failed, but that would have been the perfect way to have dealt with this in the early years.\n \n What were these establishments?\n \n Well, bathhouses weren't quite what people thought about. In fact, there are heterosexual bathhouses in the city which have individual rooms with a shower and a bed and sauna, and you can go in there just as you might go into a hotel room and have your privacy.\n \n In a [gay] bathhouse there were orgy rooms. These were rooms where there was music; the lights were down low, even maybe so low that you didn't even know who you were with -- with bodies, and I say bodies because there were no personalities at that point in time. There were what they called glory holes, where there was a hole in the wall between two rooms, and a person could put their penis through there or receive it from the other side and not know who the purveyor of that was. It truly could be an anonymous situation. There were also social situations with lights and social areas and what have you. ...\n \n Why were they such a health hazard?\n \n ... What was unique here was that people could come there and have multiple partners, as many as 20 or 30 a night. Most men, heterosexual men, could not understand how this was possible, but if you are the recipient, then obviously you could have as many partners as you can tolerate. And if you had 30 partners, and one or more of those partners was HIV positive, there was a good chance, not necessarily every night or whatever, but you were placing yourself at great risk -- unknowingly, of course, in the early years -- at risk for getting infected. ...\n \n The mayor at that time said, \"If you save one life, then it's worth closing the bathhouses.\" At the time that this was going on, it was my feeling that we wouldn't save one life; we would lose many more, because the bathhouses represented 5 or 10 percent of the gay community on any regular basis. That's who frequented those bathhouses. That left you with 90 or 95 percent of the community you needed to reach, because if you could make the bathhouses disappear overnight, you weren't going to make the transmission of this virus disappear overnight. One had to think of the entire community, and how do you reach that community and get a behavior change?\n \n Interestingly enough, before any of the drugs were discovered and out in general distribution, the rectal gonorrhea rate in this city dropped from 100 percent that we had figured that we had before down to 15 percent. There was an 85 percent drop. The reason I bring that up is in the early years, that was what we were using as a surrogate marker. We didn't have HIV identified or the test, so we figured if someone had that, there was a good chance they may have whatever this new disease was. This dropped 85 percent before any drugs, and the reason it dropped was the exposure that the Health Department and working with the gay community had in getting the message out and getting behavior change, a behavior change never seen before.\n \n If you have an obesity clinic, a smoking cessation clinic, a drug substance abuse clinic, where you're trying to get people to stop, and you get a 20 percent success rate, ... you feel you've had a success. We're talking here about an 85 percent drop in rectal gonorrhea. That meant that from a public health perspective, we must have been doing something right.\n \n Why did so many of the members of the gay community vociferously oppose the idea of bathhouses being closed? ...\n \n Opposition came from many places. I remember one gay man saying to me -- in fact, he was a neighbor -- he was saying: \"Please don't close the bathhouses. That's the only place I feel safe. I used to be a gay basher before I acknowledged my homosexuality. I don't want to be the recipient of that, and I'm safe in these facilities.\" ...\n \n Again, I think the overriding issue was, if the government in San Francisco closes the bathhouses, what is this going to say to the rest of the nation with regard to gay liberation and gay rights and all the issues attendant to that?\n \n FRONTLINE: the age of aids: interviews: mervyn silverman | PBS\n \n Side note: PBS is far from a right wing or conservative source...",

It is not being an apologist for Cuba to point out that you are lying through your teeth, any more than I would be apologising for Nazi Germany if you claimed they killed 50 million people in the death camps. It doesn't justify what they did to point out that what you are saying is wrong. It also doesn't justify the oppression in Cuba to point out that they do actually have a pretty good healthcare system, and train a lot of doctors that provide healthcare in a lot of places in the developing world. In any case, figures for infant mortality and life expectancy reported even by the CIA world factbook (hardly a bastion of support for Castro) suggested that they are comparable to the US.\n \n In any case, as I said I do not support the current Cuban regime, it is a perversion of socialism because it is oppressive and undemocratic.\n \n I wonder, when Bush was in power did you complain about him using a teleprompter (or, as he did in the 2004 presidential debates, a wire)? Did you complain about him being partisan and not leading the whole country?\n \n \nAnd Jo Bennett, Passenger rates have soared on the trains because their car is parked at home as they can't afford the 'petrol'.

   "You claim that Cuba has executed 100 000 political prisoners and you have the gall to accuse ME of using false statistics? It is not being an apologist for Cuba to point out that you are lying through your teeth, any more than I would be apologising for Nazi Germany if you claimed they killed 50 million people in the death camps. It doesn't justify what they did to point out that what you are saying is wrong. It also doesn't justify the oppression in Cuba to point out that they do actually have a pretty good healthcare system, and train a lot of doctors that provide healthcare in a lot of places in the developing world. In any case, figures for infant mortality and life expectancy reported even by the CIA world factbook (hardly a bastion of support for Castro) suggested that they are comparable to the US.\n \n In any case, as I said I do not support the current Cuban regime, it is a perversion of socialism because it is oppressive and undemocratic.\n \n I wonder, when Bush was in power did you complain about him using a teleprompter (or, as he did in the 2004 presidential debates, a wire)? Did you complain about him being partisan and not leading the whole country?\n \n \n \n Actually, it's more to do with time, the number of cars on the road (still growing by the way) means that traffic going into major cities is often slower than the train, particularly into central London. Both trains and cars are quite expensive, people short on cash generally use buses. Also, the cost of running a car has dropped in real terms in recent years. The bigger issue is the cost of housing, forcing people to live a long way away where they can afford a house. That is a result of under-regulated capitalism and house prices spiralling out of reach of everyone but the super wealthy, and the selling off and non-replacement of council housing by successive right wing governments.\n\n \n It is ridiculously easy to call someone a liar when in doing the calling, the caller fails to substantiate their previous assertion. \n \n Recent books by Humberto Fontova and Alvaro Vargas Llosa describe the real Che, and will hopefully cut down the number of his admirers. Among the lowlights, partly summarized by Fontova in this two part interview with CNS News (here and here), and by Vargas here:\n \n 1. Che was responsible for the execution of thousands of political prisoners in Cuba (most of them purely for their opposition to Castro's communist policies or for no reason at all).\n \n 2. Che enjoyed torturing and abusing the prisoners, including children.\n \n 3. Che was instrumental in setting up the Castro regime's massive forced labor camps and secret police apparatus.\n \n 4. Che tried to organize campaigns of terrorism against civilians in the US and elsewhere (though he largely failed in these efforts).\n \n 5. Far from being merely a Third World nationalist or pragmatic leftist, he was a committed, hard-line Stalinist, even going so far as to call himself \"Stalin II\" early in his career.\n \n However, as Vargas Llosa points out in a New Republic article, Che was no uncritical admirer of the Soviet Union. To the contrary, he thought the Soviets had not taken communist totalitarianism far enough. In his travels through the Soviet bloc, Che was, by his own account, most impressed with North Korea - not coincidentally also the most oppressively totalitarian of all communist states at the time. Later, as Vargas notes, he criticized the Soviets for giving the private sector too much scope, and for their unwillingness to take even greater risks of touching off a nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n \n In and of himself, Che Guevara was not that important. Cuban communism would probably have been comparably brutal even without him, and he failed miserably in his efforts to establish communist regimes elsewhere (eventually getting himself killed). However, Che's continuing popularity does matter as an indication of our failure to fully recognize the evil of communism and the magnitude of its atrocities. With some 100 million victims, communist regimes killed more people in the 20th century than all other forms of tyranny combined. Cuba's was not the worst communist regime, but its crimes were great nonetheless, if we take account of the country's small size. As Fontova points out, during the 1960s alone, the regime Che helped set up executed over 100,000 people, and incarcerated some 350,000 political prisoners out of a Cuban population that numbered only 6.3 million in 1960 (for more detailed figures, see the chapter on Cuba in the thorough Black Book of Communism). Undoubtedly, there would have been even more executions and political prisoners if not for the fact that so many Cubans were able to flee to the nearby United States.\n \n Bush did not have a teleprompter coming out his behind. Have you ever noticed that Obama NEVER, EVER looks directly at the television screen when on the tube? That's because he cannot look away from his buddy's holding up the 'cue cards' on each side of the podium. If he does attempt to look at the screen, he falls into the \"Uh...Uh...you know..ah\" idiocy....looses his place and scrambles to get back online. How do you think the media was continually able satire \"Bushisms\". You don't have a clue. \n \n The rest of your ramble is typical socialist which is exactly the problem in Britain at the present time. And, Jo, like Che, you feel the failings of socialism is because they have not taken socialism far enough.....that dupe that takes the fruits of the working man and redistributes it and calls itself 'democracy'...LOL!",

The disease has killed millions of people worldwide and it is estimated that 40 million people are HIV infected. We were unaware of the HIV and AIDS till early 1980. Nobody knows from where the virus came. It is all assumptions that scientists and researchers can make. Researchers have their view on the origin of HIV and start of AIDS. But how exactly one can state cannot be said. There are many theories about the origin of the HIV virus but none of them have been proved.\n \n No record of HIV virus exists in history and it has been said that it started in central Africa and from there it started spreading slowly and slowly.\n \n HIV was identified in 1983.Earlier the researchers found that chimps acquired the disease from eating one of their favorite preys: monkeys.\n \n \"Chimps are 98 percent genetically the same as humans, and they do not get sick from HIV. This is an especially important clue for developing an HIV vaccine\", the researchers said. \"Understanding what prevents chimps from getting sick would help scientists duplicate resistance to AIDS symptoms in humans.\"\n \n Researchers say, \"Chimps likely picked up viruses from both types of monkeys, and eventually a hybrid formed\". The researchers said, \"That probably happened tens of thousands of years ago, which may have given chimps an opportunity to evolve resistance to an AIDS-like disease.\"\n \n Some researchers say that virus related to HIV is found in monkeys in Africa. Many scientists believe that the first humans got the HIV virus from monkeys by eating them as food or being scratched or bitten by them. It is possible that during preparation of the food or butchering the meat the infected blood could have entered the human body through a cut.\n \n A Canadian flight attendant, nicknamed \"patient zero\" dies of AIDS as he had sexual connection with several of the first victims of AIDS. It is believed that he is responsible for introducing the virus into the general population. By 1984 there are almost 8000 confirmed cases in the US, with 3700 confirmed deaths.\n \n It is also said that the AIDS virus was first discovered by Robert at the National Cancer Institute in April 1984.\n The two 'co-discoverers' of HIV continue to disagree about the origin of HIV and the birthplace of AIDS till date.\n \n In the middle 1980s the Human Virus (HIV) was identified by French and American scientists as virus that leads to AIDS.\n \n During Mid - late 1990s there was significant increase in HIV in drug users due to injection of drug, Aboriginal peoples, women, and street-involved youth.\n \n Today, after so much of research and studies about the origin of HIV and start of AIDS the main goal of the scientists is to reduce and eradicate the HIV virus that causes the incurable AIDS.",

The fact is that it was the homosexual community in the USA which the AIDS/HIV virus was born into, PERIOD. There is no denying that by anyone who is the least bit rational and familiar with the actual history of the disease. You see jason, I was alive at the time and am quoting Dr. Mervyn Silverman who was director of San Francisco's Department of Public Health when the first AIDS cases were reported, and later became director of American Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR).\n \n One of the most significant incidents during his tenure in San Francisco was his battle to close down the city's bathhouses -- a position the gay community vociferously opposed. Here he recounts those arguments and expands on his own position that the bathhouses were a unique public health hazard. So deny as you like, the evidence is overwhelming just as PBS is a liberal and pro gay source which is in no way an enemy of your cause.\n \n Like all homosexuals though, you must deny true history and attempt to rewrite it in order to not implicate your community as the major cause for this deadly blood and immune system disease exists in this country. The only reason AIDS ever entered the straight community is because of transgender homosexual contact which introduced it into the straight community, not because it was born in the straight community which Dr Silverman makes very clear. \n \n \nAIDS was originally born out of the homosexual community of the 70s and early 80s Bath House culture and was initially spread through illicit sex from within that community. That REALITY is a historically undeniable FACT. Here, educate yourself since this isn't my opinion but is confirmed by the doctors who were their at the time.\n \n Now, as a public health officer, were you surprised at the idea of an epidemic breaking out within the gay community, or was this actually an accident waiting to happen?\n \n ... Sexually transmitted diseases were very significant in the gay community in San Francisco. When I arrived here in 1977, the City Clinic, which is primarily a sexually transmitted disease or STD clinic, was packed to the gills. You could barely get in the door. There were not only new infections but repeated infections, so sexually transmitted diseases were something that the Health Department and the gay community were working together on long before I got here in 1977.\n \n It was not surprising that something could have occurred as a sexually transmitted disease. However, gonorrhea, syphilis, most of the diseases that we see generally today are not killers. There was something different here. This wasn't just a sexually transmitted disease; this was a killer sexually transmitted disease.\n \n Tell me about Cleve Jones.\n \n Cleve and I were friends, and Cleve was a good person for me to bounce things off. He at that time was administrative assistant to Art Agnos, who at that time was an assemblyman [for San Francisco]. [He] was actually the first in the country to get legislation passed through the state legislature that was helpful to the fight against AIDS.\n \n Cleve and I would talk, and Cleve, among others, was always saying: \"I think the bathhouses are a problem. We really ought to do something with that.\" One day Cleve called me up and he says, \"I can't defend [you] if you close the bathhouses.\" I said: \"How can you say that? You've always said that you wanted them closed.\" He said: \"I did and I do, but if you, the director of health in the most liberal-appearing city in the country, do this, think of the impact that's going to have on less tolerant communities. We'll see an implementation of the sodomy laws, passage of laws; we'll see things against gays that we have never witnessed before, or have witnessed before but don't want to witness again.\" That argument, which was rampant through the gay community, was something that took most proponents and made them opponents.\n \n Even before Cleve did that, I was trying to work with the gay community to close the bathhouses, or at least to, quote, \"clean them up\" so that they wouldn't facilitate the spread of HIV and AIDS. In the early years before I got to San Francisco, there were several gay bars that had only one exit, which of course is a fire hazard. If the fire is between you and that exit, you can't go out. People were starting to demand that they put a second exit in. They weren't listening. They then sat in front of the bar with a fire door and a desk right out there, and within days there was a second exit. In these days, I figured if they could do that, maybe I could get them to help me close the bathhouses, or get the bathhouse owners to change the way in which bathhouses operate. I tried for years, and I failed, and I acknowledge that I failed, but that would have been the perfect way to have dealt with this in the early years.\n \n What were these establishments?\n \n Well, bathhouses weren't quite what people thought about. In fact, there are heterosexual bathhouses in the city which have individual rooms with a shower and a bed and sauna, and you can go in there just as you might go into a hotel room and have your privacy.\n \n In a [gay] bathhouse there were orgy rooms. These were rooms where there was music; the lights were down low, even maybe so low that you didn't even know who you were with -- with bodies, and I say bodies because there were no personalities at that point in time. There were what they called glory holes, where there was a hole in the wall between two rooms, and a person could put their penis through there or receive it from the other side and not know who the purveyor of that was. It truly could be an anonymous situation. There were also social situations with lights and social areas and what have you. ...\n \n Why were they such a health hazard?\n \n ... What was unique here was that people could come there and have multiple partners, as many as 20 or 30 a night. Most men, heterosexual men, could not understand how this was possible, but if you are the recipient, then obviously you could have as many partners as you can tolerate. And if you had 30 partners, and one or more of those partners was HIV positive, there was a good chance, not necessarily every night or whatever, but you were placing yourself at great risk -- unknowingly, of course, in the early years -- at risk for getting infected. ...\n \n The mayor at that time said, \"If you save one life, then it's worth closing the bathhouses.\" At the time that this was going on, it was my feeling that we wouldn't save one life; we would lose many more, because the bathhouses represented 5 or 10 percent of the gay community on any regular basis. That's who frequented those bathhouses. That left you with 90 or 95 percent of the community you needed to reach, because if you could make the bathhouses disappear overnight, you weren't going to make the transmission of this virus disappear overnight. One had to think of the entire community, and how do you reach that community and get a behavior change?\n \n Interestingly enough, before any of the drugs were discovered and out in general distribution, the rectal gonorrhea rate in this city dropped from 100 percent that we had figured that we had before down to 15 percent. There was an 85 percent drop. The reason I bring that up is in the early years, that was what we were using as a surrogate marker. We didn't have HIV identified or the test, so we figured if someone had that, there was a good chance they may have whatever this new disease was. This dropped 85 percent before any drugs, and the reason it dropped was the exposure that the Health Department and working with the gay community had in getting the message out and getting behavior change, a behavior change never seen before.\n \n If you have an obesity clinic, a smoking cessation clinic, a drug substance abuse clinic, where you're trying to get people to stop, and you get a 20 percent success rate, ... you feel you've had a success. We're talking here about an 85 percent drop in rectal gonorrhea. That meant that from a public health perspective, we must have been doing something right.\n \n Why did so many of the members of the gay community vociferously oppose the idea of bathhouses being closed? ...\n \n Opposition came from many places. I remember one gay man saying to me -- in fact, he was a neighbor -- he was saying: \"Please don't close the bathhouses. That's the only place I feel safe. I used to be a gay basher before I acknowledged my homosexuality. I don't want to be the recipient of that, and I'm safe in these facilities.\" ...\n \n Again, I think the overriding issue was, if the government in San Francisco closes the bathhouses, what is this going to say to the rest of the nation with regard to gay liberation and gay rights and all the issues attendant to that?\n \n FRONTLINE: the age of aids: interviews: mervyn silverman | PBS\n \n Side note: PBS is far from a right wing or conservative source...\n",

Way to be a big boy Junior.\n \n 1981: The Beginning\n In 1981, the first cases of AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) were identified among gay men in the United States, acquiring the designation, GRID (Gay-Related Immune Deficiency); however, scientists later found evidence that the disease existed in the world for some years prior, i.e., subsequent analysis of a blood sample of a Bantu man, who died of an unidentified illness in the Belgian Congo in 1959, made him the first confirmed case of an HIV infection. Source: CNN In an article, \"1959 and all that: Immunodeficiency viruses,\" by Simon Wain-Hobson of the Pasteur Institute in Nature (Volume 391, 5 February 1998, pp. 532-533), Wain-Hobson wrote: \"Where did HIV [Human Immunodeficiency Virus] come from? Both of the AIDS viruses, HIV-1 and HIV-2, originated in Africa... As is often the case with microbes, a jump from one species to another is probably to blame... chimpanzees (for HIV-1) and sooty mangabeys (for HIV-2)... When did the AIDS epidemic begin?... the Big Bang seems to have occurred around, or just after, the Second World War. Emerging microbial infections often result from adaption to changing ecological niches and habitats.\" Cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP, a lung infection) and Kaposi's sarcoma (a rare skin cancer) were reported by doctors in New York and Los Angeles in 1981, then the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began tracking a growing population of young men, women, and babies, whose immune systems were nearly destroyed. Late in 1982, the condition began to be referred to as AIDS. Source: American Red Cross For a few at first, their awareness of AIDS began with the publishing of a little noticed entry on page two of the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report of June 5, 1981, where a strange outbreak of killer pneumonia was spreading among gay men.

Do you also think you can catch sickle cell from black people or jaundice must be from Asians? The saddest thing about this is you prove no point. You just wanted to take a swing at someone who irritates you. Way to be a big boy Junior.\n \n 1981: The Beginning\n In 1981, the first cases of AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) were identified among gay men in the United States, acquiring the designation, GRID (Gay-Related Immune Deficiency); however, scientists later found evidence that the disease existed in the world for some years prior, i.e., subsequent analysis of a blood sample of a Bantu man, who died of an unidentified illness in the Belgian Congo in 1959, made him the first confirmed case of an HIV infection. Source: CNN In an article, \"1959 and all that: Immunodeficiency viruses,\" by Simon Wain-Hobson of the Pasteur Institute in Nature (Volume 391, 5 February 1998, pp. 532-533), Wain-Hobson wrote: \"Where did HIV [Human Immunodeficiency Virus] come from? Both of the AIDS viruses, HIV-1 and HIV-2, originated in Africa... As is often the case with microbes, a jump from one species to another is probably to blame... chimpanzees (for HIV-1) and sooty mangabeys (for HIV-2)... When did the AIDS epidemic begin?... the Big Bang seems to have occurred around, or just after, the Second World War. Emerging microbial infections often result from adaption to changing ecological niches and habitats.\" Cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP, a lung infection) and Kaposi's sarcoma (a rare skin cancer) were reported by doctors in New York and Los Angeles in 1981, then the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began tracking a growing population of young men, women, and babies, whose immune systems were nearly destroyed. Late in 1982, the condition began to be referred to as AIDS. Source: American Red Cross For a few at first, their awareness of AIDS began with the publishing of a little noticed entry on page two of the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report of June 5, 1981, where a strange outbreak of killer pneumonia was spreading among gay men. Since this report, AIDS has graduated from a seemingly local phenomenon to a global epidemic. Source: CNN\n \n The History of AIDS\n The Oxonian Review Making AIDS History\n Polio vaccines and the origin of AIDS\n\n \n Hey genius, and I use that term mockingly in reference to you. Show where I said that AIDS found its origins on the planet in homosexuality if you can. I very clearly said this in the very post of mine which you quoted: [ARCHANGEL SAID:] The fact is that it was the homosexual community in the USA which the AIDS/HIV virus was born into, PERIOD. In other words, it was through the homosexual community which this blood disease found an avenue to spread and infect first homosexuals and then over time, straights as a sexually transmitted disease which spread via sexually promiscuous activity. \n \n I agree that the origin of how this immune deficiency disease first crossed into humans is not known in any absolute way, but there is no doubt at all that the AIDS epidemic of the 70s and early 80s IN AMERICA, a time when the symptoms were known but the ailment had no name yet, was founded within the homosexual community and was traced specifically to the unprotected sex orgies and unnatural acts which took place in the homosexual bath houses in the major cities in this country. They proved to be ground zero for the transmission of this plague which is why a government edict closed ALL bath houses everywhere until strict safe sex guidelines could be established and enforced before allowing homosexual bath houses to reopen. Of course what happens in the private rooms in these bath houses today is anyones guess, but we know they don't follow or enforce the safe sex policies which have been established. :xbanghead",

I've seen Jason promote gay sex, call those who believe in what the Bible says against homosexual sin 'bigots' and 'homophobes,' and worse, and many other things. Why don't you go rummage through his posts and see for yourself.\n \n Also, I'd still like you to tell us what parts of the Bible you believe and what your criteria is for your selective beliefs. \n \n Have you come to the point where you have recognized that God has identified gay sex as a sin (perversion / abomination)? In case you missed it in scripture, here's part of what's written on that.\n \n Leviticus 18:22 - \"Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.\" \n \n Leviticus 20:13 - \"If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.\"\n \n Romans 1:26-27 - \"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - \"Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n \n 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - &#8220;But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine&#8230;&#8221;\n \n Jude 7 &#8211; &#8220;In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.&#8221; \n \n There's no gay marriages in the Old Testament; No gay marriages in the New Testament; no gay sex approved anywhere in the Bible. Just the opposite - gay sex is condemned in both testaments. God is consistent on that.\n \n If you want to believe in the God of the Bible as you claim, then perhaps it's time to believe what he says that's not politically correct.",

The fact that ignorance, unprotected sex, et al, contributed to the rapid start of HIV and AIDS, is not negated by whatever argument you are trying to make.\n \n \nIt doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why it spread so quickly in the gay community:\n [*]by and large, gays have sex only with other gays... yes or no?\n [*]relative to the population at large, the proportion that is homosexual is itty-bitty... yes or no?Take two glasses of water, one that's almost full (representing the hetero majority) and one that's almost empty (representing the gay minority). Squeeze a couple drops of red ink (representing the HIV virus) into both glasses. Which glass gets redder faster?\n\n Notwithstanding your protestations to the contrary, AIV and AIDS is transmitted primarily through homosexual anal intercourse, it is transmitted to heterosexuals through bi-sexual sexual intercourse, through heterosexual men using the services of prostitutes who had serviced bi-sexuals or the occassional hoimosexual, etcetra, etcetra, the incidence of transmission in the heterosexual community by a man or a woman who never had sexual contact with a homosexual, is ZERO. Tainted blood obviously has some incidence, but the fact that heterosexuals are able to contact AIDS is not conductive to the homosexual argument that 'both heterosexuals and homosexuals are at risk'. This is simply a red-herring to divert the focus from where it belongs.\n \n \nDUH!! Get a friggin clue from the clue bag!\n\n Apparently you don't have one.\n \n \nYou think gays cause AIDS? Fine.

Homosexuals would continue to spread AIDS to the heterosexual community regardless. 'Marriage' is simply a ruse to lift homosexual relationships onto a par with traditional marriage. \"Committed relationships' are the rarity rather than the norm.\n \n \nSince when is it okay to stigmatize people with a disease in this country?

First, the number of sex partners is a factor. Gays tend to have LOTS more than straights. Second, transmission is more likely via anal sex than vaginal sex. That's why many heteros don't get AIDS from a hetero partner with HIV. \n Now, back to your lame analogy. \"Squeeze a couple of drops of red ink\". A \"couple of drops\" distributed to <5% of the general population is far out of proportion to the amount that they would have received randomly. If HIV was randomly dispersed throughout the population as you would LIKE us to believe, the gay community would only have received 1/20th of the amount that the general population received. (that would be 1/10th of a drop for the purist). The likelihood of it spreading so much more in the gay community than in the general population would have to be attributable to either a 20X increase in the number of sexual partners in the gay community, the increased likelihood of spread through anal sex, a combination of the two or something else. (We'll leave out drug usage because it only comes into play later on).\n \n\n You think gays cause AIDS? Fine.

Now they want to execute gays with AIDS that have same sex intercourse.\n \n\n You don't want all those \"promiscuous\" gays to spread AIDS to the straight community?

   "The point is that anyone who has sex with more than one partner is culpable, whether gay or straight. You are trying to blame gay people for something that is nothing to do with sexuality and everything to do with sexual ethics. In many ways the homophobes are to blame for the promiscuity in sections of the gay community. When you tell people that they're going to hell just because they're gay, is it any surprise that they decide to throw out real personal morality that you have tried to tie to sexuality? If you tell them that being gay is so terrible, and they've decided you're full of it, why would they not then ignore genuine morality?\n\n \n You are just totally void of any understanding of personal responsibility, aren't you Jo!!! All you know how to do is make excuses for the homosexuals as you blame moralists for their rebellion against God and their unnatural sexual proclivities. And the fact that you misinterpret my post just as a flaming homosexual will by referring to me as a homophobe, this leads me to believe that you too are a homosexual who has been attempting to cover his leaning by claiming to be a christian.\n \n Of course you have never once defended actual christian or truly spiritual values or principles in any way which has been the cause for so many disagreements between us. And here once again we see the same excuses and justifications made for the homosexuals as you attempt to blame true christians for their and probably your own sins.",

   "Originally Posted by Archangel: Poor, poor Jason, he just can't handle the truth. Everytime he's confronted with it he lashes out like a caged badger spewing his slanderous and baseless invectives with malice and vitriol. It isn't my responsibility to convince you sonny boy, but to just inform with historical facts. What you do with those facts is completely up to you.\n \n \n \n I've seen Jason mock Archangel many times. I've seen Jason promote gay sex, call those who believe in what the Bible says against homosexual sin 'bigots' and 'homophobes,' and worse, and many other things. Why don't you go rummage through his posts and see for yourself.\n\n \n Only times I can think of are in response to comments made and no offense to Jason but he lacks will or ability to reach the same degree of spiteful rhetoric AA does. \n \n \n \nAlso, I'd still like you to tell us what parts of the Bible you believe and what your criteria is for your selective beliefs. \n \n Have you come to the point where you have recognized that God has identified gay sex as a sin (perversion / abomination)? In case you missed it in scripture, here's part of what's written on that.\n\n \n Editing Easy your falling prey to it. Find a bible written in the 50's and see if it doesn't differ in it's wording from what you have above. Then go back another 50 years and see if that matches the second. They don't and they won't. \n \n You can argue that the overall meaning has not changed but that would be a lie. The anti-gay Christian agenda is patient. Over the years they slowly change translations, add or remove in order to support their position. It may only be to make an ambiguous verse more specific\n \n \n \nLeviticus 18:22 - \"Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.\" \n \n Leviticus 20:13 - \"If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.\"\n\n \n Your not Jewish so no need to clarify this for you\n \n \n \nRomans 1:26-27 - \"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. \n \n In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\"\n\n \n \n For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even\n their women did change the natural use into that which is\n against nature:\n \n And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the\n woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men\n working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves\n that recompense of their error which was meet.\n \n I copied these verses from a 2005 version of the KJV. If you read the meaning of the actual Greek it becomes even more evident that there is purposeful intent to make what isn't specific become so. \n \n 1:26 For this reason, God gave them up to vile passions. For their women changed the natural function into that which is against nature.\n \n 1:27 Likewise also the men, leaving the natural function of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another, men doing what is inappropriate with men, and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error.\n \n \n Above is The World English Bible I think 2003 (10th edition)\n \n 1:26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:\n \n 1:27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.\n \n This is from a KJ I am not sure what year\n \n As you can see the changes are slight, but imply a more specific meaning. \n \n Verse 26 could be a variety of non-homosexual activities such as multiple male partners, abstinence, dressing as a man and refusing to marry and have children.\n \n Verse 27 could also include non-physical acts such as dressing or acting as a woman or the submissive role males played in Goddess religions it could even be due to Paul's lack of understanding of the practices of pagan worship. After all Paul was a Jewish zealot before becoming a Christian zealot. How often do you suppose he went and observed pagan rituals?\n \n \n1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - \"Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n\n \n Corinthians is even worse. Paul uses two words nobody knows for sure the meaning of. Why would Paul invent two words to describe something the Greek language had at least 3 words for? Regardless homosexual offenders isn't the phrase first used. Even abusers of themselves with mankind doesn't mean homosexuals as mankind includes women.\n \n \n \"in his much used reference manual, Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament, 1979, J. H. Thayer admits that a much broader term \"must be adopted in these passages\"....because we have learned \"how leniently converts from among the heathen regarded this vice and indulged in it\". In other words, he is telling us that we must modify the way we translate the Bible so that we can ensure a general condemnation of sexual acts outside of marriage regardless of what the text actually says.\"\n \n It's interesting to see the evolution the translation has gone thru from effeminate to sissy to child molester to pervert.\n \n Mercy To All\n \n So other than fornication or male prostitution gays don't have a biblical prohibition other than what man has decided. This of course is based on the Theory of Nature which has been proven false.\n \n \n \nThere's no gay marriages in the Old Testament; No gay marriages in the New Testament; no gay sex approved anywhere in the Bible. Just the opposite - gay sex is condemned in both testaments. God is consistent on that.\n \n If you want to believe in the God of the Bible as you claim, then perhaps it's time to believe what he says that's not politically correct.\n\n \n If you want I can insert a couple and then it would. IT would be no different than what already happens every year. God is not consistent regarding gays, but man is persistent in his belief about it.\n \n Should we bring back slavery or selling oneself into bondage? How about women's rights? Bible not only condones the first two but offers instruction on how practiced. Today it's illegal and aborhant. The bible clearly says what role women are to play in society and it ain't what you got going on in your backyard boo boo.",

   "Corinthians is even worse. Paul uses two words nobody knows for sure the meaning of. \n\n \n Any student and scholar of NT theology knows that claim is absurd. You've obviously never studied what you just wrote. What stupid website did you did that one out of?\n \n \n\n Why would Paul invent two words to describe something the Greek language had at least 3 words for? Regardless homosexual offenders isn't the phrase first used. Even abusers of themselves with mankind doesn't mean homosexuals as mankind includes women.\n\n \n You didn't read the link I provided, did you? If you had you would have seen this:\n \n Paul and 'Arsenokoite'\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-10; 1 Timothy 1:9-10\n Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders ['abusers of themselves with mankind']... will inherit the kingdom of God. \n \n We also know that law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels... for adulterers and perverts ['them that defile themselves with mankind']... \n \n Traditional Position:\n \n \"Them that defile themselves with mankind\" comes from the word Greek word arsenokoite, meaning \"homosexual.\" Paul is saying homosexuality is a vice excluding its practitioners from the kingdom of God.\n \n Pro-Gay Argument:\n \n 'Arsenokoite' is a word coined by Paul. It never appeared in Greek literature before he used it in these scriptures. There were, at the time, other words for \"homosexual.\" Had he meant to refer to homosexuality, he would have used one of the words already in existence. Most likely, he was referring to male prostitution, which was common at the time.\n \n Boswell points out, accurately, that the word is peculiar to Paul, suggesting he did not have homosexuality in mind when he used it.[86] Prostitution is Boswell's first choice. If not that, he suggests Paul was condemning general immorality. At any rate, the term, according to this argument, means some sort of immoral man but not a homosexual.\n \n Response:\n \n Paul coined 179 terms in the New Testament. The terms do not, because they are original, significantly change the context of the verses they appear in.\n \n Nor is it remarkable he would have coined this one, considering he derived it directly from the Greek translation of the Old Testament (the Septuagint):\n \n meta arsenos ou koimethese koiten gyniakos \n (Lev 18:22)\n \n hos an koimethe meta arsenos koiten gynaikos \n (Lev 20:13)\n \n In other words, when Paul adopted the term arsenokoite, he took it directly from the Levitical passages-in the Greek translation- forbidding homosexual behavior. The meaning, then, could not be clearer: Though the term is unique to Paul, it refers specifically to homosexual behavior.\n \n As for the inference that it applies to male prostitution, a breakdown of the word shows it implies nothing of the sort. 'Arsene,' as mentioned earlier, appears few times in the New Testament, always referring to \"male.\" 'Koite' appears only twice in the New Testament, and means \"bed,\" used in a sexual connotation:\n \n Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality [koite] and debauchery... (Rom 13:13)\n \n Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed [koite] kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral. (Heb 13:4)\n \n The two words combined, as Paul used them, put \"male\" and \"bed\" together in a sexual sense. There is no hint of prostitution in the meaning of either of the words combined to make arsenokoite. \n \n Responding to Pro-Gay Theology\n \n That wasn't so difficult, was it now?\n \n \n\n Should we bring back slavery or selling oneself into bondage? How about women's rights? Bible not only condones the first two but offers instruction on how practiced. Today it's illegal and aborhant. The bible clearly says what role women are to play in society and it ain't what you got going on in your backyard boo boo.\n\n \n What part of \"love your neighbor as you love yourself,\" and \"love your wife as Christ loved the church\" is so confusing to you that you think Jesus or Paul condoned slavery or wife abuse?\n \n You really need to study up more on these subjects and issues before you hop out here like this. \n \n You're still lost, and you still need Christ as your Lord and Savior.",

   "The problem is that you are assuming that sex in a committed same sex relationship is sinful.\n\n \n Once again you compromise and pervert Gods word when you imply that homosexuality in a committed relationship is acceptable to God in any way. Feel free to show even one passage which speaks to homosexuality that says \"unless they are in committed relationships\". \n \n Beside that, we weren't talking about sex in committed relationships at all, anyway. We were discussing the 70s and the 80s when AIDS was first discovered to be killing men in the homosexual community and was found to be born in the bath houses which were ground zero for this disease spreading into the straight community. And there was nothing that can be remotely referred to as monogamous about the orgies and random sex which takes place in those dens of iniquity. So here you go spouting more excuses and justifications which have no bearing in the discussion taking place.\n \n \n Everything that we consider sinful, from adultery to theft, to bearing false witness and covetting the possession of others, is demonstrably harmful to the individual sinner and to society in general (i.e. it contradicts Christ's commandment to love your neighbour). In the context of a society where everyone is married and the birth rate needs to be kept high, homosexual relationships would fall into this, in much the same way as eating shellfish would do in a hot climate with poor hygiene and little way of dealing with disease.\n\n \n Hey Jo, do you remember where it says to \n \n \"love the sinner but hate the sin\"? \n \n Or how about this passage:\n Tts 2:11 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people,\n Tts 2:12 training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age,\n Tts 2:13 waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,\n Tts 2:14 who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works.\n Tts 2:15 Declare these things; exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard you.\n Do these words mean nothing to you, Jo? Have you no appreciation for the depth of there meaning? I stand by verse 15 for the authority to exhort, correct and rebuke you for the luke warmness of your testimony. Especially since you consider that my honesty makes me an enemy of yours. \n \n \nNow, this is a matter of interpretation, of what you consider passages on scripture to be referring to and the degree to which all scripture is applicable for all time.\n \n Finally, even if homosexuality is always a sin in every situation, I have no need to be concerned, on account of my being straight and happily married, and I would thank you not to suggest otherwise.\n\n \n No it isn't a matter of interpretation, not for anyone who knows and sees the truth in Gods word and His consistent character throughout the bible. You are all too willing to compromise Gods values in order to justify your desire to accept unnatural sin which He condemns, as being right, normal and good. Shame on you and may God have mercy on your soul when you finally learn the truth which you abandon in every debate here as you defend the sinners against those you claim are your brothers in Christ.

Of that there is no doubt at all. From those hubs travelers went back to their respective cities and states and spread the virus further.\n \n This isn't to say the bisexuals and gay curious men who had strong hetero relationships in the straight community didn't also play in these dens of iniquity anonymously and get infected also, that explains how it broke into the straight community and by default women started to be carriers and victims of it.

That isn't to say that it was born in that community, but it somehow made the leap into it and it was the conditions and random sex in the bath houses which created a perfect platform for the transfer and spread of AIDS because of the constant influx of tourists who took it home with them to parts unknown.\n\n \n I am not going to insult you by saying your not being very intelligent, so please give yourself the respect and try to convince that you were just trying to establish something factual. \n \n You weren't. Just as your last sentence you of course can and will defend, but the truth is it was not the US sending it out to the world nor can you confirm it was strictly gay tourists returning from weekend orgies that spread it around the rest of the nation. It didn't come from gay monkeys having sex with gay Africans who spread it to gay Haitians who gave it to gay Americans. Yes without question the gay community was hit the hardest, but was your intent to address promiscuous sex as the primary cause of spread or being gay? \n \n You also left out a portion of the article that you set in italics and red with some touches of bold and then repeated in subsequent posts for what in a thread called The Taint of Christian Sanctity?\n \n You may want to at least read the first one below. Jo Bennet made a comment similar that pushed a button, but your guy says pretty much the same thing as Jo.\n \n \n... To what degree did this disease spread as a result of prejudice against gay people?\n Whenever you have a marginalized population, the chance of spread of disease is very possible, because, by being marginalized and being discriminated against, people generally don't come forward, at least not in the early days of a problem, to bring forth this, because by coming forward, you are announcing your status in society. ...\n \n Was there a feeling in the community at large that these people, so to speak, had created their own problems, that it was almost like a punishment, that they deserved what they were getting?\n ... People talk about guilt and innocence. If you were gay, you were guilty of getting AIDS; if you were a baby, you were innocent. Of course everyone at that time was totally innocent, because no one knew that this thing was percolating, if you will, through society. This virus was spreading in the early '70s, very likely in San Francisco. We only saw the manifestation in the early '80s, so everyone at that point was innocent. The reason I stress that is [today] people are engaging in unsafe behavior who know better, and that is not innocence. I don't know if it's guilt, but it's certainly not innocence.\n \n ... What were the clues that showed this was not a gay plague?\n ... In public health we know that epidemics don't stay neatly packaged in little categories, and so we knew pretty well -- we weren't sure how it was going to spread, but we were pretty sure it was going to be others [outside of] the gay community.

It became very clear that we had something that was much broader than just dealing with the gay community. ...\n\n \n Bottom line your not God and therefore just because you say it doesn't make it so.

   "Let's try this again, unless Jo is determined to run away from the truth as usual...\n \n \nThe problem is that you are assuming that sex in a committed same sex relationship is sinful.\n\n \n Once again you compromise and pervert Gods word when you imply that homosexuality in a committed relationship is acceptable to God in any way. Feel free to show even one passage which speaks to homosexuality that says \"unless they are in committed relationships\". \n \n Beside that, we weren't talking about sex in committed relationships at all, anyway. We were discussing the 70s and the 80s when AIDS was first discovered to be killing men in the homosexual community and was found to be born in the bath houses which were ground zero for this disease spreading into the straight community. And there was nothing that can be remotely referred to as monogamous about the orgies and random sex which takes place in those dens of iniquity. So here you go spouting more excuses and justifications which have no bearing in the discussion taking place.\n \n \n Everything that we consider sinful, from adultery to theft, to bearing false witness and covetting the possession of others, is demonstrably harmful to the individual sinner and to society in general (i.e. it contradicts Christ's commandment to love your neighbour). In the context of a society where everyone is married and the birth rate needs to be kept high, homosexual relationships would fall into this, in much the same way as eating shellfish would do in a hot climate with poor hygiene and little way of dealing with disease.\n\n \n Hey Jo, do you remember where it says to \n \n \"love the sinner but hate the sin\"? \n \n Or how about this passage:\n Tts 2:11 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people,\n Tts 2:12 training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age,\n Tts 2:13 waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,\n Tts 2:14 who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works.\n Tts 2:15 Declare these things; exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard you.\n Do these words mean nothing to you, Jo? Have you no appreciation for the depth of there meaning? I stand by verse 15 for the authority to exhort, correct and rebuke you for the luke warmness of your testimony. Especially since you consider that my honesty makes me an enemy of yours. \n \n \nNow, this is a matter of interpretation, of what you consider passages on scripture to be referring to and the degree to which all scripture is applicable for all time.\n \n Finally, even if homosexuality is always a sin in every situation, I have no need to be concerned, on account of my being straight and happily married, and I would thank you not to suggest otherwise.\n\n \n No it isn't a matter of interpretation, not for anyone who knows and sees the truth in Gods word and His consistent character throughout the bible. You are all too willing to compromise Gods values in order to justify your desire to accept unnatural sin which He condemns, as being right, normal and good. Shame on you and may God have mercy on your soul when you finally learn the truth which you abandon in every debate here as you defend the sinners against those you claim are your brothers in Christ. Can you see why I struggle with your claims and protestations as you defend the wrong side every time? emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Any student and scholar of NT theology knows that claim is absurd. You've obviously never studied what you just wrote. What stupid website did you did that one out of?\n\n \n No mostly just the Christian ones. The difference is I have done my research, to bad you can't say them. Once more you are led straight off the cliff\n \n \nYou didn't read the link I provided, did you? If you had you would have seen this:\n \n Paul and 'Arsenokoite'\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-10; 1 Timothy 1:9-10\n Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders ['abusers of themselves with mankind']... will inherit the kingdom of God. \n \n We also know that law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels... for adulterers and perverts ['them that defile themselves with mankind']... \n \n Traditional Position:\n \n \"Them that defile themselves with mankind\" comes from the word Greek word arsenokoite, meaning \"homosexual.\" Paul is saying homosexuality is a vice excluding its practitioners from the kingdom of God.\n \n Pro-Gay Argument:\n \n 'Arsenokoite' is a word coined by Paul. It never appeared in Greek literature before he used it in these scriptures. There were, at the time, other words for \"homosexual.\" Had he meant to refer to homosexuality, he would have used one of the words already in existence. Most likely, he was referring to male prostitution, which was common at the time.\n \n Boswell points out, accurately, that the word is peculiar to Paul, suggesting he did not have homosexuality in mind when he used it.[86] Prostitution is Boswell's first choice. If not that, he suggests Paul was condemning general immorality. At any rate, the term, according to this argument, means some sort of immoral man but not a homosexual.\n\n \n You almost got it. The word has been used and pushed by Christians to mean homosexual, but really it doesn't.\n \n \nResponse:\n \n Paul coined 179 terms in the New Testament. The terms do not, because they are original, significantly change the context of the verses they appear in.\n \n Nor is it remarkable he would have coined this one, considering he derived it directly from the Greek translation of the Old Testament (the Septuagint):\n \n meta arsenos ou koimethese koiten gyniakos \n (Lev 18:22)\n \n hos an koimethe meta arsenos koiten gynaikos \n (Lev 20:13)\n \n In other words, when Paul adopted the term arsenokoite, he took it directly from the Levitical passages-in the Greek translation- forbidding homosexual behavior. The meaning, then, could not be clearer: Though the term is unique to Paul, it refers specifically to homosexual behavior.\n\n \n Have to call this what it is, idiotic. \n It actually is surprising that he would disregard several specific words for a new word with an ambigous meaning. Combining two words to express two verses is really a poor conclusion. It's like saying Gravity keeps our feet on the ground and The tides are moved by gravity and I coin the word gravitymotion to use in a sentence Do you understand the term gravitymotion?\n \n \nAs for the inference that it applies to male prostitution, a breakdown of the word shows it implies nothing of the sort. 'Arsene,' as mentioned earlier, appears few times in the New Testament, always referring to \"male.\" 'Koite' appears only twice in the New Testament, and means \"bed,\" used in a sexual connotation:\n \n Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality [koite] and debauchery... (Rom 13:13)\n \n Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed [koite] kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral. (Heb 13:4)\n \n The two words combined, as Paul used them, put \"male\" and \"bed\" together in a sexual sense. There is no hint of prostitution in the meaning of either of the words combined to make arsenokoite. \n \n Responding to Pro-Gay Theology\n \n That wasn't so difficult, was it now?\n\n \n Will you ever read what you post? He says it means bed, which it does along with another 15 - 20 other things. A good example is his first verse where he said it meant bed and it is used for sexually immoral. So using your evidence I take version 1 and you can have version 2 and so far at best it's a draw. \n \n So far. \n Below our some instances of verses in which our magic words are used along with definitions from LSJ. You will notice the facts don't support your claims very well.\n \n 4. pen, fold for cattle, PLips.118.15 (ii A.D.).\n II. act of going to bed, t\u00b0w ko\u00dbthw \u00cbrh bed-time, Hdt.1.10, 5.20; trap\u00a1z\u00fa ka\u00dc ko\u00dbt\u00fa d\u00a1kesyai to entertain 'at bed and board', ibid.; t\u00afn skhn\u00afn e\u00dew k. di\u00a1luon for going to bed, X.Cyr.2.3.1 (but ke\u00ddsyai ko\u00dbtan to lie still in death, A.Ag.1494 (lyr.)).\n III. lodging, entertainment, PTeb. 122.1 (i B.C.), al.\n IV. of sexual connexion, \"k. did\u00f1nai\" LXX Nu.5.20, cf.

Thereafter it occurs no more than 74 times in the intervening millennia, with 56 of these in the six centuries after Paul coined it.\n \n It is claimed that the term arsenokoitai appears in the Revenue Laws of Ptolemy Philadelphus in the third century B.C., i.e., before Paul first used the word. However, neither the whole word nor its morpheme arsen is there. Check for yourself here.\n \n One scholar lists the 73 various academic references for arsenokoit available in 2000 and uses his background to translate the word as 'homosexual slave trader,' 'homosexual rape,' or 'having non-procreative sex.' Another, here, looks at the phrases in 1 Timothy 1 and the meanings of the known words, and he concludes from the parallel constructions that verse 10 could well be translated \"For male prostitutes, boys who have sex with men, and slave dealers who enslave them both.\"\n \n Paul used a total of 179 terms that are not attested before his New Testament writings.\n \n \n Around 35 A.D., the Jewish philosopher Philo (a contemporary of Paul's) held that arsenokoites referred to shrine prostitution (Philo, The Special Laws, III, VII, 40-42). This is the origin this site suggests for it (see comments on the letters to Timothy and Corinth), though the context suggests that Paul may have been condemning pederasty, group sexual orgies, and/or people who are not innately gay/lesbian/bisexual but who engage in homosexual acts. Philo apparently felt that the word condemned pederasty and incest as well.\n \n In spite of this, anti-gay writers say that claiming that Paul was not creating a generic term for homosexuality is a modern, revisionist, pro-gay position).\n \n Five Sibyls, The Libyan Sibyl (1511)Somewhat later appeared the apocryphal Acts of John (a 2nd-century Christian text) and the Sibylline Oracles (a third- or fourth-century Jewish text); in both the word occurs among sins related to economics, i.e., sex induced by a need for money. A meaning reflecting homosexual rape appears in the second century Apology of Aristides (chapters 9 and 13) and the third century Refutatio Omnium Haeresium of Hippolytus. The Apology tells of the rape by Zeus of the mortal boy Ganymede; in a somewhat similar tale in Hippolytus (chapter 5), a fallen (male) angel named Naas forcibly rapes Adam in the Garden. Both of course share the common thread of an aggressor forcing himself on a weaker individual - a meaning that would also fit the other contexts quite well.\n \n \"And let the murderer know that the punishment he has earned awaits him in double measure after he leaves this (world). So also the poisoner, sorcerer, robber, swindler, and arsenokoites, the thief, and all of this band....\"\n The Acts of John\n \n \"Do not steal seeds. Whoever takes for himself is accursed (to generations of generations, to the scattering of life). Do not arsenokoites, do not betray information, do not murder. Give one who has labored his wage. Do not oppress a poor man.\"\n Book II.\n \n \n A revealing use of it appears around 575 A.D.; Joannes Jejunator (John the Faster), the Patriarch of Constantinople, used the word in a treatise that instructed confessor priests how to ask their parishioners about sexual sin. Here it appears in the context of a paragraph dealing with incestuous relations, and if translated as 'homosexuality,' the sentence containing it would read \"In fact, many men even commit the sin of homosexuality with their wives.\" (Patrologiae cursus completus, Series Graeca, 88:1893-96) Though at the time it apparently referred to anal or oral sex or to sex forced upon a woman, it pretty clearly had nothing to do with homosexuality.\n \n And, because arsen is singular, there was a long period leading up to the Reformation in which the term was taken to refer to masturbation (i.e., involving only one male), a translation that persists in some Greek dictionaries today.\n Other Meaning Evidence\n \n Paul's obvious knowledge of the Jewish scriptures makes the analysis of arsenokoites as referring to shrine prostitution compelling for an objective researcher.\n \n Suppose, however, that such simple logic is set aside in finding the word's meaning.\n \n In Greek culture, relationships between men (and particularly between a master and his pupil) were common; they were an important theme in literature, and there was a range of very specific Greek words that Paul could have chosen among. The argument has been made that Paul coined a new term because he wanted to condemn more than just, say, pederasty, and his new term avoided using a multitude of specific Greek terms in order to cover the whole subject. This demonstrates both prejudice and a solid ignorance of ancient Greek; Greek also had general words to refer to homosexuality.\n \n Trying to figure out what the word means by looking just at its component parts is linguistically na\u00efve. Of course, at one time the meaning of any compound word did depend on some aspects of the parts, but language change and usage quickly alter and can obscure this. Consider the parts of 'chairman,' which did indeed begin with 'chair' (meaning 'throne,' something it doesn't mean nowadays) and 'man' but now is compounded to produce a very different word that doesn't necessarily involve either chairs or men.\n A case can be (though usually isn't) made that arsenokoites does apply to homosexuality by using the analogy of some other (mostly very rare) compound words of similar vintage. Arsenokoites - the first part of which means 'adult male' - appears to fit neatly within a pattern:\n \n \u0095 doulo\u00b7koitEs consorter with slaves (slave-bedder)\n \u0095 deuteron\u00b7koite to have a bed-fellow (two-bedder)\n \u0095 polu\u00b7koitos promiscuity (many-bedder)\n \u0095 homo\u00b7koitos bedfellow (same-bedder)\n \u0095 enOto\u00b7koitEs with ears large enough to sleep in (ears\u00b7bed)\n \n Unfortunately for such a scheme, there is already a combination for sex with a male:\n \n \u0095 andro\u00b7koitEs having intercourse with a man\n \n and it is a feature of languages that they do not create different forms for identical meanings.\n \n In addition, consider the parts of enOto\u00b7koitEs. A logical meaning for this word, if the key were analogy to the others in the set, would be something like 'a person with a (sexual) ear fetish.' The morphology of a word provides clues to how it was originally made, but in terms of meaning, it only shows how very fertile the process of language creation is. A similar process could produce arseno + koites = man + bed, &#8776; man sleeping &#8594; couch potato. (Easyrider)\n \n Linguistic analysis offers only one fairly certain aspect of the word. Ken Collins notes here that Greek contains a form of arsen that is used in compounds when the male receives the action: arren (he cites the Greek word meaning 'to give birth to a male child'). When arsen is used, the male involved is the one performing the action. Since the other bad guys in Paul's lists perform sins of excess, arsenokoites would too, and he offers heterosexual sex maniacs as a possible meaning.\n \n Certainly, some aspects of each of the components, 'male' and 'bed,' were originally present, but a sounder process for finding its meaning would be to make inferences about it from contexts in which it appears. Unfortunately, this has not been very productive either. In 1997 the Thesaurus Lingua Graecae database listed 73 usages of arsenokoites, but most of these appear in contexts similar in pattern and vocabulary to Paul's lists. None of them indelibly mark the word with a single meaning (though for at least one context the meaning 'homosexual' would be impossible). It is both claimed and disputed that the term tends to occur between listings of sexual sins and social sins, which would suggests that the term originally had some sort of relationship to sexual injustice - and all of the usages found are compatible with this interpretation. In all of them the term could indicate subjugation to and/or exploitation by a powerful aggressor, whether in the context of rape or of treatment of slaves - i.e., coercive, non-procreative sex. Still, even this meaning is not absolutely forced on us - and meanings do change with time.\n \n The force of Paul's warnings very likely were instrumental in helping eliminate temple prostitution. This left behind a word of uncertain meaning that Paul had sternly disapproved of ... and audiences were left with filling in the blank. Child molestation, anal/oral intercourse with one's wife, and masturbation were three topics that certainly, at different times, became associated with the word; the latest simply is (male) homosexuality.\n \n The end result of a lot of research is simply that - in spite of a lot of claims - the meaning of arsenokoites is obscure. One prominent investigator of the meaning of arsenokoites, Dale Martin of Yale University comments, \"I should be clear about my claims here. I am not claiming to know what arsenokoites meant, I am claiming that no one knows what it meant.\"\n \n (\"Arsenokoites and Malakos: Meanings and Consequences,\" in Biblical Ethics and Homosexuality: Listening to Scripture, ed. by Robert L. Brawley, Knox Press, 1996, p. 123).\n \n Not many others are so humble; most have their favorite candidates for its meaning and, in the case of anti-gays, the meaning is confidently given as something akin to '(practicing) homosexual' (variations on this theme depend on the writer's political leanings). All such translations betray a serious ignorance - often intentional - of both ancient Greek and the culture in which the word was used; and they also basically reveal an entrenched political position - nothing more.\n \n Now that was easy.\n \n \nWhat part of \"love your neighbor as you love yourself,\" and \"love your wife as Christ loved the church\" is so confusing to you that you think Jesus or Paul condoned slavery or wife abuse?\n \n You really need to study up more on these subjects and issues before you hop out here like this. \n \n You're still lost, and you still need Christ as your Lord and Savior.\n\n \n Said the man who once again has been measured, weighed and found wanting. Maybe you can take a class or something to help you out.\n \n You see no conflict with love thy neighbor followed by instructions on how to treat your slaves?",

The rules for the treatment of slaves applied mostly to Herew masters with Hebrew slaves or bondsmen. Gentile slaves were not accorded the treatment and rights. They were not subject to freedom at Jubilee, they had the potential to gain freedom, but so did colonial slaves. They could be hunted or captured if they escaped. They could be beaten, raped, separated from family, traded, sold or passed on to children as property. A person could be born into slavery and unless a Hebrew the chance to become free was something the slave had almost no control over.\n \n What you want is for it to be completely different but let's face facts a being held against your will and forced to perform acts against your will is slavery. \n \n A bondsmen or woman differed only in that the person may and that is a big may have consented because of circumstances and if Hebrew knew that freedom was a possibility. \n \n If a 12 year old is sold by parents to pay debts and is released 3 years later during Jubilee, to return to their parents to be sold again? What if a girl who became pregnant. Now she is looked upon poorly and her child doesn't go home with her because it belongs to the Master not her.\n \n Are these what make biblical slavery so completely different than colonial slavery?",

So if I am misguided so must they be. \n \n Refute the evidence with fact or admit the truth of it.\n \n \n \n 1 Timothy 6:1-3 \"Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed. And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort. If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;\"\n \n \n Ephesians 6:5-9: \"Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.\"\n \n \n \nGod the Father didn't send Jesus to overthrow the Romans and their system of slavery, etc. Besides his mission of salvation, he sent him to change men from the inside out so they wouldn't practice it.\n\n \n It was not just the Romans and according to you Romans would be in the don't ask, don't tell group of slavers. \n \n And you call me disingenuous, nice try Jesus came to change men from the inside so they would abandon slavery. Is there anything else you would like to make up? If this were true you would think he would at least mention in it in an unflattering manner, but he doesn't .\n \n Here is Jesus' chance to speak against slavery and maybe next time. \n \n Luke 12:45-48: \"The lord [owner] of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers. And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.\"",

   "Ahhh I see so God was more than willing to use extreme punishment for not loving your neighbor. Like how Sodom and Gomorrah were punished for not loving their neighbor.\n\n \n Yeah. It's either God's way or the Highway to hell. I guess you'd prefer they all wind up in hell?\n \n You say you believe in the God of the Bible. Are his judgments against sin and evil something new to you? Have you ever read Deuteronomy chapter 28?\n \n \nNo you are in denial. Read the writings of the Church fathers who understood slavery to be God's will. So if I am misguided so must they be. Refute the evidence with fact or admit the truth of it.\n\n \n I don't go by what some church fathers wrote. I stand on what the Word of God says. And I've already quoted that.\n \n \n\n \n 1 Timothy 6:1-3 \"Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed. And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort. If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;\"\n \n Ephesians 6:5-9: \"Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.\"\n\n \n What's your point? You prefer Paul told them to start an insurrection against Rome so they could all be butchered? That's really smart.\n \n \nJesus came to change men from the inside so they would abandon slavery. Is there anything else you would like to make up? \n\n \n Once again, you have no clue about the Holy Spirit, who over time, and with the believer's cooperation, changes the hearts of men. From Galatians 5:\n \n 16So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature. 17For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature. They are in conflict with each other, so that you do not do what you want. 18But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law. \n \n 19The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; 20idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions 21and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. \n \n 22But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. 24Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires. 25Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. \n \n Progressive Sanctification by the Holy Spirit:\n \n The process of progressive sanctification is described in Galatians 5:19-23. Progressive sanctification is the journey of producing less and less of the acts of the sinful nature (Galatians 5:19-21) and more and more of the fruit of the Holy Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23). Progressive sanctification is a process empowered by the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 5:18) and enabled through prayer and the study of God's Word. 2 Timothy 3:16-17 tells us, \"All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.\" \n \n Progressive Sanctification\n \n Why don't you read it this time. Evidently you didn't read it when I previously posted it, which is why you err when you accuse me of making that up.\n \n \nHere is Jesus' chance to speak against slavery and maybe next time.....\n\n \n Jesus already spoke (Love your neighbor as yourself, etc.). You're not listening.",

   "\n \n I don't see any of the anti-gay verses here hmmm why could that be?\n \n \n\n \n It's anti-gay sex. And here they are:\n \n Gen. 1 & 2 - we see from the beginning that the complimentarity of the sexes reflects God's inner unity and His creative power and Fatherhood. God created man and woman to become one flesh which is consummated in the act of marital love.\n \n Gen. 2:18 - throughout the creation story, God says \"it is good\" seven times. But when God pointed out that man was alone, God says \"it is not good.\" God then created woman. Man and woman therefore belong together by God's design, according to His natural and supernatural law. \n \n Gen. 2:24 - God created man and woman so that they could share communion. This communion is consummated in the marital act (which must be between a man and a woman). This communion is also a reflection of the eternal communion of the Blessed Trinity, who created man in His own image and likeness. \n \n Gen. 19:24-28 - the Lord rained fire and brimstone on Sodom and Gomorrah as punishment for the sin of homosexuality. Homosexuality perverts God's covenant with humanity. \n \n Gen 13:13; 18:20: while homosexuals argue that the sin in Genesis 19 was the sin of \"inhospitality,\" these verses show that the Sodomites were evil and wicked people before the alleged sin of inhospitality. That is because the Sodomites were guilty of homosexuality, not inhospitality. In fact, 2 Pet 2:6:8 says that Lot witnessed their evil sexual practices \"day after day.\" The Sodomites' sin was daily and pervasive. \n \n Gen 19:5: this confirms that the Sodomites' sin is homosexuality. Here, the Sodomites mistaken the two angels for men and, surrounding Lot's house, ask to have sex with them. When the yell to Lot \"bring them out that we may know them,\" the Hebrew for \"to know\" (yadah) in Gen 19:5 means having sexual relations. See, for example, Gen 4:25 where \"yadah\" refers to sexual relations between Adam and Eve. \n \n 2 Pet 2:6-10: Peter also proves that the Sodomites were guilty of homosexuality. He says God condemned them for \"licentiousness\" and \"lust of defiling passion,\" which is where we get the title \"Sodomite\" for a homosexual. The Greek \"aselgeia anastrophes\" for lustful behavior is also found in Rom 13:13; Gal 5:19; Eph 4:19 and Jude 4. \n \n Jude 7: Jude also confirms the Sodomites' sin is homosexuality. Jude says they \"indulged in unnatural lust\" (Greek, ekporneusasai) and went after \"strange flesh\" (Greek, sarkos heteras) in reference to their homosexual sins. \n \n 2 Peter 2:4-6: Peter also reveals that the Sodomites are suffering in hell for their sins by comparing the Sodomites' punishment to the eternal punishment of the evil angels. Just as God did not spare the angels when they sinned but cast them into hell, so He did the same with the Sodomites when He \"condemned them to extinction and made them an example to those who were to be ungodly.\" \n \n Jude 5-7: Like Peter, Jude confirms that the Sodomites are in hell by saying that they had the same fate as the evil angels. Jude says just as the evil angels were condemned to hell, the Sodomites \"likewise\" (Greek, hos) acted immorally and are undergoing a punishment of eternal fire. \"Undergoing\" (Greek, upechousai) is a present participle which means their suffering is ongoing. See also the clear polarity between those who are saved (v.5) and those who are condemned (vv. 6-7,11,13). \n \n Lev. 18:22, 29 - God commands a man never to lie with a male as with a female, or he will be cut off. This refers to supernatural death which is eternal separation from God. While the Old Covenant laws have been abrogated by the New Covenant, the Church has adopted their moral principles. Thus, the moral prohibitions on homosexuality still apply in the New Covenant, as Peter, Paul and Jude demonstrate. \n \n Lev. 20:13 - God says that if a man lies with another man, he shall be put to death. From the very beginning, God has revealed that homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered, unhealthy, and mortally sinful. \n \n Deut. 22:5 - cross-dressing is also considered an abomination before God. \n \n Matt. 19:6 - after referring to God's divine plan for man and woman, Jesus says a husband and wife become one flesh, which ultimately reflects God's union with humanity through the Church. Homosexual unions pervert this divine truth of God's love for and union with the human race. \n \n Rom. 1:26 - also, when a woman lies with another women (lesbianism), this is unnatural and a perversion. God wants His children to be pure and holy as He is holy. Paul condemns all homosexual acts, whether committed by men or women. \n \n Rom. 1:27 - Paul calls the practice of homosexuality shameless, unnatural and a perversity. It is contrary to the natural law, as it eviscerates the life-giving aspect of human sexuality and reduces it to a selfish, pleasure-seeking end. \n \n 1 Cor 6:9: Paul teaches that sodomites will not enter into the kingdom of God. The Greek word for \"sodomite\" (arsenokoites) literally means \"male copulation\" or \"male sexual relations.\" The Greek \"arsen\" means \"male\" and \"koites\" means \"coitus\" or \"sexual relations.\" Paul uses the same word in 1 Tim 1:10. \n \n 1 Tim. 1:10 - sodomites are called ungodly and sinners, unholy and profane, lawless and disobedient. They are called by God to chastity. It is important to note that homosexual attractions and inclinations, while disordered and dangerous, are not by themselves sinful per se. It is the acting out on homosexual attraction that is sinful. Those with homosexual desires can still live a life worthy of Christ by remaining chaste and pure as they abstain from acting out on their desires. \n \n Scripture Catholic - HOMOSEXUALITY",

Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. \n \n Traditional Position:\n \n Paul views homosexuality as a symptom of fallen humanity, describing it as unnatural and unseemly.\n \n Pro-Gay Argument #1:\n \n Paul is not describing true homosexuals; rather, he is referring to heterosexuals who, as he says \"exchanged natural relations.\" The real sin here is in changing what is natural to the individual. Boswell takes this argument up when he states:\n \n The persons Paul condemns are manifestly not homosexual: what he derogates are homosexual acts committed by apparently heterosexual persons. The whole point of Romans 1, in fact, is to stigmatize persons who have rejected their calling, gotten off the true path they were once on.[82]\n \n Mollenkott agrees, saying, \"What Paul seems to be emphasizing here is that persons who are heterosexual by nature have not only exchanged the true God for a false one but have also exchanged their ability to relate to the opposite sex by indulging in homosexual behavior that is not natural to them.\"[83]\n \n In short, Paul in Romans 1 describes heterosexuals who have deliberately committed homosexual acts, thus violating their true nature. Homosexuality, if committed by true homosexuals, is not a sin.\n \n Response:\n \n Paul is not speaking nearly so subjectively in this passage. There is nothing in his wording to suggest he even recognized such a thing as a \"true\" homosexual versus a \"false\" one. He simply describes homosexual behavior as unnatural, no matter who it is committed by.\n \n His wording, in fact, is unusually specific. When he refers to \"men\" and \"women\" in these verses, he chooses the Greek words that most emphasize biology: arsenes and theleias. Both words are rarely used in the New Testament. When they do appear, they appear in verses meant to emphasize the gender of the subject, as in a male child (arsenes). In this context, Paul is very pointedly saying the homosexual behavior committed by these people was unnatural to them as males and females (arsenes and theleias ). He is not considering any such thing as sexual orientation. He is saying, in other words, that homosexuality is biologically unnatural-not just unnatural to heterosexuals, but unnatural to anyone.\n \n Additionally, the fact these men were \"burning in lust\" for each other makes it highly unlikely they were heterosexuals experimenting with homosexuality. Their behavior was born of an intense inner desire. Suggesting, as Boswell and Mollenkott do, that they were heterosexuals indulging in homosexual behavior requires unreasonable mental gymnastics.\n \n Besides which, if verses 26-27 condemn homosexual actions committed by people to whom they did not come naturally, but do not apply to people to whom those actions do come naturally, then does not consistency compel us to also allow the practices mentioned in verses 29-30-fornication, backbiting, deceit, etc.-so long as the people who commit them are people to whom they do come naturally?\n \n Pro-Gay Argument #2:\n \n This scripture describes people given over to idolatry, not gay Christians who worship the true God.\n \n Perry states:\n \n The homosexual practices cited in Romans 1: 24- 27 were believed to result from idolatry and are associated with some very serious offenses as noted in Romans 1. Taken in this larger context, it should be obvious that such acts are significantly different than loving, responsible lesbian and gay relationships seen today.[84]\n \n Response: \n \n Idolatry certainly plays a major role in Romans Chapter One. Paul begins his writing by describing humanity's rebellion and decision to worship creation rather than the Creator. The pro-gay theorist seizes on this concept to prove that Paul's condemnation of homosexuality does not apply to him-he does not worship idols, he is a Christian. \n \n \"But,\" Schmidt cautions, \"Paul is not suggesting that a person worships an idol and decides therefore to engage in same-sex relations. Rather, he is suggesting that the general rebellion created the environment for the specific rebellion. A person need not bow before a golden calf to participate in the general human denial of God or to express that denial through specific behaviors.\"[85]\n \n A common sense look at the entire chapter bears this out. Several sins other than homosexuality are mentioned in the same passage:\n \n Fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whisperers; backbiters, haters of God, disobedient to parents.... (vv 29-30)\n \n Will the interpretation applied to the verse 26-27 also apply to verses 29-30? Any sort of intellectual integrity demands it. If verses 26-27 apply to people who commit homosexual acts in connection with idolatry, and thus homosexuals acts are not sinful if not committed in connection with idolatry, then the same must apply to verses 29-30 as well.\n \n Therefore, we must assume that fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness et al are also condemned by Paul only because they were committed by people involved in idolatry; they are permissible otherwise.\n \n Which is, of course, ridiculous. Like homosexuality, these sins are not just born of idol worship; they are symptomatic of a fallen state. If we are to say homosexuality is legitimate, so long as it's not a result of idol worship, then we also have to say these other sins are legitimate as well, so long as they, too, are not practiced as a result of idolatry.\n \n Responding to Pro-Gay Theology\n \n You're busted, as usual.",

Both of us STD free.\n What are our chances of dying from AIDS?\n\n \n You answer: \n \n \nIf what you say is true, your chances of dying from AIDS is still possible because of the potential from mixing of types of bodily fluids and materials that were never intended to be passed between two men. Gay sex is an assault on your immune system even if you truly kept it between the same two men in my opinion. Also, if what you say is true, then you are neither representative of the norm within the homosexual community, nor are you representative of the norm for homosexual couples who statistically swap partners and have random sex even when in so called exclusive relationships. So your point is nice on a personal level but it has no place in reality.\n\n \n \nSince you asked, I'm talking about human feces and the effect it has on the partner with an open sore and has a virus or a bacterial infection. Can you say for certain that the bacteria in feces can't become a virulent strain under those circumstances? So it isn't that gay men have different fluids than straight men, it's just that straight men don't mix them. Do you now see how ignorant your statement was? Or do you admit that you made the statement just to be sarcastic and insulting?\n\n \n \nI mean, what is it about anal sex that contributes to HIV? Is it the simple sex act? Or the mixing of the biological fluids! Obviously it's the fluids in combination with open sores or lesions. It doesn't take a genius to deduce the obvious connection.\n\n \n You quite clearly tried to argue that two gay men who are HIV free and monogamous can contract HIV by mixing body fluids.

It is perfectly possible that two gay people should not have sex with anyone until they settle down together, just as it is possible for a straight couple. If one person is already infected then that's a different issue, but the premise of the question was that both parties were NOT infected.\n\n \n Here's what I'm talking about<b></b>:\n I. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HOMOSEXUAL AND HETEROSEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS\n \n The current media portrayal of gay and lesbian relationships is that they are as healthy, stable and loving as heterosexual marriages - or even more so.2 Medical associations are promoting somewhat similar messages.3 Nevertheless, there are at least five major areas of differences between gay and heterosexual relationships, each with specific medical consequences. Those differences include:\n \n A. Levels of promiscuity \n B. Physical health \n C. Mental health \n D. Life span \n E. Definition of \"monogamy\"\n \n back\n \n A. Promiscuity\n \n Gay author Gabriel Rotello notes the perspective of many gays that \"Gay liberation was founded . . . on a 'sexual brotherhood of promiscuity,' and any abandonment of that promiscuity would amount to a 'communal betrayal of gargantuan proportions.'\"4 Rotello's perception of gay promiscuity, which he criticizes, is consistent with survey results. A far-ranging study of homosexual men published in 1978 revealed that 75 percent of self-identified, white, gay men admitted to having sex with more than 100 different males in their lifetime: 15 percent claimed 100-249 sex partners; 17 percent claimed 250- 499; 15 percent claimed 500-999; and 28 percent claimed more than 1,000 lifetime male sex partners.5By 1984, after the AIDS epidemic had taken hold, homosexual men were reportedly curtailing promiscuity, but not by much. Instead of more than 6 partners per month in 1982, the average non-monogamous respondent in San Francisco reported having about 4 partners per month in 1984.6\n \n In more recent years, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has reported an upswing in promiscuity, at least among young homosexual men in San Francisco. From 1994 to 1997, the percentage of homosexual men reporting multiple partners and unprotected anal sex rose from 23.6 percent to 33.3 percent, with the largest increase among men under 25.7 Despite its continuing incurability, AIDS no longer seems to deter individuals from engaging in promiscuous gay sex.8\n \n The data relating to gay promiscuity were obtained from self-identified gay men. Some advocates argue that the average would be lower if closeted homosexuals were included in the statistics.9 That is likely true, according to data obtained in a 2000 survey in Australia that tracked whether men who had sex with men were associated with the gay community. Men who were associated with the gay community were nearly four times as likely to have had more than 50 sex partners in the six months preceding the survey as men who were not associated with the gay community.10 This may imply that it is riskier to be \"out\" than \"closeted.\" Adopting a gay identity may create more pressure to be promiscuous and to be so with a cohort of other more promiscuous partners.\n \n Excessive sexual promiscuity results in serious medical consequences - indeed, it is a recipe for transmitting disease and generating an epidemic.11 The HIV/AIDS epidemic has remained a predominantly gay issue in the U.S. primarily because of the greater degree of promiscuity among gays.12 A study based upon statistics from 1986 through 1990 estimated that 20-year-old gay men had a 50 percent chance of becoming HIV positive by age 55.13 As of June 2001, nearly 64 percent of men with AIDS were men who have had sex with men.14 Syphilis is also more common among gay men. The San Francisco Public Health Department recently reported that syphilis among the city's gay and bisexual men was at epidemic levels. According to the San Francisco Chronicle:\n \n \"Experts believe syphilis is on the rise among gay and bisexual men because they are engaging in unprotected sex with multiple partners, many of whom they met in anonymous situations such as sex clubs, adult bookstores, meetings through the Internet and in bathhouses. The new data will show that in the 93 cases involving gay and bisexual men this year, the group reported having 1,225 sexual partners.\"15\n A study done in Baltimore and reported in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that gay men contracted syphilis at three to four times the rate of heterosexuals.16 Promiscuity is the factor most responsible for the extreme rates of these and other Sexually Transmitted Diseases cited below, many of which result in a shortened life span for men who have sex with men.\n \n Promiscuity among lesbians is less extreme, but it is still higher than among heterosexual women. Overall, women tend to have fewer sex partners than men. But there is a surprising finding about lesbian promiscuity in the literature. Australian investigators reported that lesbian women were 4.5 times more likely to have had more than 50 lifetime male partners than heterosexual women (9 percent of lesbians versus 2 percent of heterosexual women); and 93 percent of women who identified themselves as lesbian reported a history of sex with men.17 Other studies similarly show that 75-90 percent of women who have sex with women have also had sex with men.18The Health Risks of Gay Sex\n \n The problem remains that sexual promiscuity is a natural and normal part of the homosexual experience and culture. Gay bars are meat markets where homosexuals go when bored in order to meet a new and as of yet unknown sex partner on any given day or night. I myself have been approached in bar/restaurants during the day by homosexuals who made such clear offers for sex that rather than saying no to their offer of sex, I went straight to letting them know that I wasn't a homosexual. \n \n Of course straight bars are also meat markets per se, but most women are far more discriminating and wont just grab the first random guy that comes along in order to satisfy their sexual desires. They seek some common attraction before becoming sexually intimate.",
