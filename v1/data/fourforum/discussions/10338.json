   "If we pull out of Iraq, AQ has no reason to keep operations there going. Currently their operations are aimed primarily at inciting sectarian violence and ensuring that our stay in Iraq is as long and expensive as possible.\n\n \n Not so. AL Qeada has every reason to want to build forces in Iraq and they are doing so. But they can only do this while the Shia Militias are being held back from mobilizing. Naturally we (the United States) can not allow the Shia to mobilize and this plays right into the hands of AL Qeada. They can continue to attack as they are trained with the U.S. there.\n \n Osama studied economics and business administration[9] at the Management and Economics School of King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah. Some reports suggest bin Laden earned a degree in civil engineering in 1979,[10] or a degree in public administration in 1981 (wikipedia)\n \n He is no fool. The last time we where mulling over a withdraw, AL Qeada sent a message stating they where going to crush us in Iraq knowing this would harden our stay there and allow them to operate.\n \n AL Qeada can not afford to have a Shia state here, the Shia are direct enemies to AL Qeada. Saudi Arabia, the home to most of AL Qeada is threatened by a Shia state in Iraq. Which is why we are doing what we are doing in my mind anyway.\n \n AL Qeada indeed wants to control Iraq as the baathists did. But they know the Shia Militias are currently to powerful for them to hold any ground. They need time. And we are giving it to them. \n \n Osama knows that is message plays right into the hands of the Republicans.. He knows this. His statements are to harden our resolve in Iraq.\n \n Its kinda funny that Osama becomes the Republicans savior as we near an election. There are reasons Osama is playing the Party card. He knows if we leave...His will be driven off in short order in Iraq.",
