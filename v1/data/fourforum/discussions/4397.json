   "Where 1 is the lowest and 10 is the highest (most knowledgable), how could you classify most creationist's general scientific knowledge?\n\n Most creationists are 2 or below. In my experience they have little idea of what science is or how it works. You will often see a creationist talk about Biblical literalism as a \"theory,\" in an effort to elevate their mythology to the level of science. They also try to convince us that science is based on faith in an effort to degrade science to the level of their mythology.\n \n Some creationists who are actually respected by other creationists for their scientific \"knowledge\" actually rate a 1. Examples are Kent Hovind, Carl Baugh, and Don Patton - all with bogus doctoral degrees. Hovind has a real degree from a Bible college. His other degrees are from a diploma mill. Baugh essentially granted himself his degrees.\n \n Other creationists should rate very high but don't. Jonathan Sarfati actually has a Ph.D. in chemistry, and I have no doubt that he has some knowledge of chemistry. But it seems that he never grasped what science is or how it works on a more general level. It is interesting to note that of all fields of science, there are more chemists who are creationists than any other. Of course, biologists and geologists have the fewest creationists.\n \n Jonathan Wells has 2 Ph.D.s. The first was from the Unification Theological Seminary - he is a moonie, you know. While there he decided to dedicate his life to destroying Darwinism. At least one must respect the fact that Wells had the ganas to actually learn the basics of what he opposes - he has a Ph.D. in biology from the University of California, approved and financed by Father Moon. You would think that his knowledge of science would be a 10, but he actually rejects science.\n \n In fairness, it would be appropriate that each responder rate their own general knowledge of science. I would rate myself at 7 or 8. My degrees were conferred a long time ago. I haven't been an active scientist or teacher for many years. I try to keep up (currently reading a text on molecular biology). But still, there is so much to learn. That is one of the reasons that I haunt discussion boards. There are some real scientists/teachers who contribute and they give instruction and offer internet links and book recommendations that assist me in learning.",

   "IIRC, both Einstein and Hawking were referring to a Creator God. IMHO, they were both referring to the same one. (Why should there have been a need for two?)\n\n \n But your opinion doesn't match the evidence. FYI, there are many conepts of gods, one or two is not enough for humans.

   "If two brilliant scientist searching for answers regarding the origin of the universe both admit that there HAD to have been a creator of the universe,...\n\n But they didn't admit that there HAD to be a creator. In fact, Hawking stated several times that the opposite is the case.\n \nThroughout the 1970s I had been mainly studying black holes, but in 1981 my interest in questions about the origin and fate of the universe was reawakened when I attended a conference on cosmology organized by the Jesuits in the Vatican. The Catholic Church had made a bad mistake with Galileo when it tried to lay down the law on a question of science, declaring that the sun went round the earth. Now, centuries later, it had decided to invite a number of experts to advise it on cosmology. At the end of the conference the participants were granted an audience with the pope. He told us that it was all right to study the evolution of the universe after the big bang, but we should not inquire into the big bang itself because that was the moment of Creation and therefore the work of God. I was glad then that he did know the subject of the talk I had just given at the conference -- the possibility that space- time was finite but had no boundary, which means that it had no beginning, no moment of Creation.\n --Hawking, Stephen. The Illustrated A Brief History of Time. Bantam Books. New York. p. 144-45\n\n \nThe quantum theory of gravity has opened up a new possibility, in which there would be no boundary to space-time and so there would be no need to specify the behavior at the boundary. There would be no singularities at which the laws of science broke down and no edge of space-time at which one would have to appeal to God or some new law to set the boundary conditions for space-time. One could say: 'The boundary condition of the universe is that it has no boundary.' The universe would be completely self-contained and not affected by anything outside itself. It would neither be created nor destroyed. It would just BE.\n --Hawking, Stephen. The Illustrated A Brief History of Time. Bantam Books. New York. p. 175\n\n \nThe idea that space and time may form a closed surface without boundary also has profound implications for the role of God in the affairs of the universe. With the success of scientific theories in describing events, most people have come to believe that God allows the universe to evolve according to a set of laws and does not intervene in the universe to break these laws. However, the laws do not tell us what the universe should have looked like when it started -- it would still be up to God to wind up the clockwork and choose how to start it off. So long as the universe had a beginning, we could suppose it had a creator. But if the universe is really completely self-contained, having no boundary or edge, it would have neither beginning nor end: it would simply be. What place, then, for a creator?\n --Hawking, Stephen. The Illustrated A Brief History of Time. Bantam Books. New York. p. 181\n",

   "http://ed.augie.edu/~kbhartma/einstein.htm\n ...\n \n Aside from his scientific achievements, Einstein is well known also for his religious and social stances. Born a Jew, his parents were not strictly religious and rarely attended worship. Young Einstein, however, was a devout Jew who observed the strict Jewish Laws. However, around the age 11 or 12, he realized that the Bible could no longer be factually true and grew wary of organized religion and those in power, some claimed he viewed it as oppressive.\n \n There is a deep connection between his scientific work and his theological beliefs. He began to look for the intrinsic beauty and natural simplicity of the laws of nature. Often times, intuition told him that there must be simpler equations to what he had been working on.\n \n Einstein did not profess to any organized religion later in life and rarely attended an organized religious service. However, this does not mean he was not religious, in fact, quite contrary. He did not think of God as the traditional supreme being, but rather as an impenetrable mystery. Einstein was held in awe of this simplistic beauty. While he used the term \"God\" he used it in the sense of a universal set of physical laws that governed the cosmos; a deeper, incomprehensible power. \n \n He was heavily influenced by Spinoza, who believed that God is essentially the physical laws that control the universe, not a being of sorts. His notorious quote \"God does not play dice\" simply means that behavior can't be left to chance, it must be governed by some simple law. He felt that organized religion was actually a deterrent to the truth; he found the idea of a being who punishes the bad and rewards the good or interferes with natural law as preposterous.\n \n To him there was an inseparable need for both religion and science. There were not contrary and needed to coexist. Another of his famous quotes is, \"Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.\" Einstein felt that neither one could answer all of \"the questions\" of the world, and therefore there is a codependency on each other. It is the job of science is to describe the apparent surrounding reality, while religion was a search for meaning. His outspokenness drew attention from religious leaders of all faiths. Some supported his revolutionary thinking, but many condemned him as an enemy to the Judeo-Christian tradition.\n \n Sadly, Einstein could not deny his religious past and was forced to flee Germany in the late '30's because of the Nazi reign. He took at a position at Princeton University where he remained until the end of his days. While he was outspoken for his pacifism, he was a key motivater in the beginning of the Manhattan Project only because he feared the consequences of Hitler producing an atom bomb first. \n \n Along with Leo Szilard, he wrote a letter to President Roosevelt describing the incredible power of the atomic bomb along with Germany's head start on the project. The Manhattan Project, quite possibly the largest scientific collaboration ever, began on December 6, 1941, one day before the bombing of Pearl Harbor and three days before Germany declared was on the United States.\n \n After WWII, he felt obligated to become a spokesperson for the Jewish nation, and was in fact offered the position as the prime minister of Israel. He would no longer be associated with Germany because of the abominations committed in the war against humanity.\n \n Albert Einstein was a revolutionary thinker, both scientifically and philosophically. He blended these two into one with complete harmony, a value he sought all his life. His relativity work has proved the existence of black holes and still guides astronomers to this day. \n \n It may seem that some of his objections to quantum theory were incorrect, but they were in an attempt to find a more complete, unification theory. Some believe that the scientific community is lurking on the edge of the unified theory, which should it come to pass, would give the last laugh to Einstein. \n \n While his scientific achievements brought him world fame, this did not phase his search for the truth. One of my favorite of Einstein's many quotes sums up his personal beliefs, accomplishments, and motivation, \"Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius -- and a lot of courage -- to move in the opposite direction.\"",

   "He was heavily influenced by Spinoza, who believed that God is essentially the physical laws that control the universe, not a being of sorts.\n\n Right. In other words, not a creator. Einstein actually believed in the steady state universe - no beginning and no end. That is why he opposed Lema\u00eetre's \"cosmic egg\" hypothesis until Hubble showed him that he was wrong. Thus he had to remove his \"cosmic constant\" from his theory of general relativity and admit that the universe was expanding, and therefore at one time in the past, had its origins in a small point. Einstein called this his greatest error. Gamow formulated a theory similar to Lema\u00eetre's.
