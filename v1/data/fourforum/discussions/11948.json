   "Georgian opposition organized for Saakashvili 'the black Friday', November 7, 2008 4 forty thousand meeting in memory of dispersal last year's opposition meeting when over 600 persons were hospitalize shook Tbilisi.\n Well I can get it. Georgian president is simply not relevant! He didn't found better then appoint new prime-Minister, an unknown diplomat Grigola Mgalobishvili. I think that by this way Saakashvili tried to turn Georgia nation attention off from opposition movements and defuse situation around collapse of military operation against South Ossetia. He recruited some new people into his team who may become even more attracting targets for criticism than a looser president! It will not help him; it looks like a terminal state! Same story with the new Georgian Foreign Minister - Eca Tkeshalashvili. In accord with Georgian Mass Media reports she was seen in ties with criminals and has close relations with some Georgian thoroughbred.\n I think that by this changes Saakashvili is trying to keep afloat inn political boat! Look, not only Georgian opposition dream about his retirement but Georgian criminal elite hunt for president's head! Otherwise I think that Saakashvili's days are numbered. His possible follower is Burdjanadze who hurriedly created her own opposition party!",

   "It's sounding more and more like Karl Rove, Dick Cheney and John McCain's campaign manager, Randy Scheunemann who, by the way, was formerly Donald Rumsfeld's top deputy, egged Georigia into attacking in South Ossetia and Abkhazia in order to provoke Russia into a confrontation and possibly cause another war -- as if the two ongoing stupid wars in Iraq and Afghanistan werer not enough.",
