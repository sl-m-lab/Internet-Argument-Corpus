   "1 March, 2011 the agreement of simplification of visa requirements and readmission between EU and Georgia came on-stream! In fact this is a breaking the wall for Georgian citizens who will be able to get simple EU visa but Georgians who are in EU now should be deported! \n I live in France since 2005, I have got a status if refugees but I knew a lot of Georgians who leave Georgia because of political repression, economical pursuit, blackmail, officials suppression but here they are staying illegally! And now just image a person who get live and dictatorship scourged for a long time will be deporting to police-ridden state! I had never thought that Europeans can step up to the plate for the lives of thousand Georgians who will not see more than prison in Georgia!\n And one more idea, most part of EU's Georgians are greybeard and they couldn't survive the tortures and prison sentences again! Will be it simply for EU democracy or Saakashvili who will get a next chance to annihilate his enemies?",
