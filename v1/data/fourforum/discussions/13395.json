In 2005, the FBI referred 67,713 cases to the ATF, but federal prosecutors pursued only 135 of those cases.\n\n \n Where am I getting with this? The bill that would allow the Attorney General to deny a firearms purchase to anyone and everyone if their name is on the secret suspected terrorist watch list. The list with an unknown criteria for getting on, no disclosure so you know even if you are on it, and absolutely no way to get off of it.\n \n And what are these mayors saying? That a person who gets denied a firearms purchase -because their name is on this secret list and the AG has the power and authority to deny you said purchase- needs to be prosecuted as if they're a criminal.",

   "You lost me there. Try them how and for what?\n\n \n Don't ask me, I'm not one of the scumbags behind this proposal. McCarthy introduced the \"No Fly No Buy Act of 2009\" that would automatically add the names of everyone on the no fly list, to the NICS database so they would be prevented from buying a gun or passing a background check. And we have the mayors with a 51 page proposal, stating that prosecutors should prosecute people who fail the NICS background check.\n \n \nThis bill is a long way from passing. Doesn't seem to have great support beyond the \"plenty\" people you mentioned.\n\n \n Is that supposed to be some sort of comforting pacification statement? That doesn't make anything better, nor does it change the fact that these big names in gun control are trying to implement these practices.",
