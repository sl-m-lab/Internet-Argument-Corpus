Yes, it's older than NO. It was founded in 1714, the first settlement in the La. territory. It's where Steel Magnolias was filmed and where Jim Croce died. I hated that place with all my soul and never desire to return. I had to leave before I slit my wrists.\n \n Anyway, I don't know where you got the catfish, but that's pretty much La. for you. You're gonna find some catfish so it probably wasn't unique to Natchy. Maybe you liked that place because you didn't have to live there, sorry I don't share any enthusiasm for the place. It's a nice place to visit...\n \n Ah! Except eating at \"The Crawfish Hole\" which is one of the few places that will serve you fresh boiled crawfish. It's right across the street from the drive through liquor store and daiquiri shop (god I miss La. for those- Tenn. just doesn't do daiquiris and would never sell them at a drive though).\n \n I know New Roads. It's right outside of Baton Rouge. emoticon_cool\n \n I miss a lot of things about La. except the reason I don't live there anymore and that's no jobs. Well, low paying jobs are mostly what you'll find these days. \n \n Well, anyways, where you at?",

I wonder about this because I don't really have too much of a basis for comparison. I just try not to be an a-hole. Besides, I go other places and people are friendly enough.
