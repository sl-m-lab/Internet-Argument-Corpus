   "I saw them last night here in Calgary, the only Canadian stop on their tour, and I just gotta tell someone.\n \n I had the best seats for a concert I've ever had, row 2, seat 5. By halfway through the concert I was standing right in front of the stage. That alone made the experience incredible. It's almost surreal to be that close to the band.\n \n On top of that, they are an incredibly impressive band live. Stevie Nicks still sounds great and Lyndsey Buckingham blew my mind, that man can flat out play a guitar, and his style is so unique, Mick's drum solo was pretty amazing too.\n \n I saw Aerosmith a couple months back, and for me there was no comparison, Fleetwood Mac was hands down the better band. I've seen Bo Diddley and Merle Haggard in the last month too, and I love Merle Haggard, but FM put on a better show than both of them no question. :p\n \n Without my amazing seat, they're easily in my top 10 concerts of all time, with my seats, probably in the top 5.\n \n Anyone else seen them or going to see them?\n \n Waxy",
