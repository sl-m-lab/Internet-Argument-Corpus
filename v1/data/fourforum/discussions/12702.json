   "It's a lot shorter than I would have thought based on The Christian Church's interpretation of Paul's teachings. Not any of the Apostles who actually spent some time with Jesus, but the one they wouldn't allow to preach to his own people, the chosen people of God and didn't accept as an Apostle, but that is a topic for another thread.\n \n Below are a couple of OT laws that were supposed to be forever, but per Paul no longer apply.\n \n Exodus 28\n Exodus 29\n Exodus 12\n Exodus 31\n Genesis 17\n Leviticus 16\n \n There are a whole lot more. So why do Christians justify the word of Paul over Moses (who at least said God said)",
