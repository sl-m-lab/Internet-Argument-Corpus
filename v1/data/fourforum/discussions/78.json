Virginia, who used the bible almost solely to reject the claim that whites and blacks had the right to marry. The supreme court specifically rejected the religion based analysis as incompatible w/ the 1st amendment.[\n \n \nThe purpose thus of the Constitution ws not to express Christian faith but to allow such faith freedom from the state in order to dominate society, law, and education.\n \n \n I have no idea where he get's a warrent for that (that the constitution was desigined so one religion could dominate the laws and education, incidentally, how is allowing one religion to dominate government entities such as law and religion NOT an expression of christian faith), but if that ever comes to pass, which thankfully it hasn't, I'm moving.",

Ruggles was sentenced to 3 months in jail and a $500 fine for attacking the country by attacking Jesus Christ.\n \n I haven't read it but it sounds like judicial error by an idiot judge. Perhaps you would explain the facts of the case for us. I suspect you don't know them and are parroting this from some other site. That's why I ask. But even if the case is as you represent it, what does that have to do with the foundation of our nation on christian principles?\n \n Perhaps you are unaware of the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli. Said treaty was negotiated in Washington's second term by Joel Barlow, formerly appointed by Washington as chaplain to the Continental Army. Since the final language of the treaty was established before Washington left office, it is presumed that he was aware of it and approved, although there is no record that he commented. The treaty was ratified by the Senate without a discenting vote in the term of JOhn Adams. Rather than just sign the treaty, President Adams added a personal note, a rare occurance. Adams said:\n \n Now be it known, That I John Adams, President of the United States of America, having seen and considered the said Treaty do, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, accept, ratify, and confirm the same, and every clause and article thereof. And to the End that the said Treaty may be observed and performed with good Faith on the part of the United States, I have ordered the premises to be made public; And I do hereby enjoin and require all persons bearing office civil or military within the United States, and all others citizens or inhabitants thereof, faithfully to observe and fulfil the said Treaty and every clause and article thereof\n \n One of the articles that Adams accepted, ratified, and confirmed (with the advice and consent of the Senate) was the following from article 11:\n \n As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion...\n \n The Constitution can much of its bases in principles of the Bible. The 3 Branches - Isaiah 33:22. Churches not being taxed - Ezra 7:24.\n \n You're going to have to offer some sort of logical argument for the 3 branches being based on the Bible. They aren't. They were actually the invention of James Madison, a Deist. As for churches not being taxed, please cite the specific article of the constitution where you find this. Obviously you know next to nothing about the Constitution (but still more than Calli).\n \n \"I have lived, Sir, a long time and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth -- that God governs the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire cannot rise without His aid? We have been assured in the sacred writings that, 'except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it.'\" - Benjamin Franklin, at the Constitutional Convention, June 28, 1787\n \n Nice. But Franklin wasn't a christian. He was a Deist.\n \n \"It is impossible to govern rightly without God and the Bible.\"--- George Washington\n \n Washington was also a Deist. Are you aware that in his personal correspondence there is not a single mention of God or Jesus?\n \n But never mind that. None of this addresses the question. You haven't even hinted at why our nation is founded on christian principles. You're going to have to show me, for example, specific articles in the Constitution that are based on specific tenets of christianity.",

Have you read the Declaration of Independence lately? \"they are endowed by their\n Creator with certain unalienable Rights...\" \"appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions...\" Who do you think the \"Creator\" and \"Supreme Judge of the World\" is? Allah?\n \n No. The diety of humanism. The words were written by Thomas Jefferson, a deist and a humanist. The words are quite typical of the humanism of the time. Notice that it doesn't say \"God\" or does it mention \"Jesus\".\n \n Perhaps you should read the Declaration carefully.\n \n \"...the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God...\" Typical expression of the deist humanists. Notice that Nature is given precedence. Just a little effort to educate oneself of the facts will teach you that this is decidedly not a reference to the christian god.\n \n You left out several very important phrases. \"We hold these truths to be self evident...\" Notice that these truths are not revealed. Typical of the humanist reliance on oneself to act honorably without being threatened by religious dogma. \"...that all men are created equal...\" Certainly not a tenet of christianity. Throughout its history christianity has recognized the superiority of some over others. That is why Elizabeth is, by the Grace of God, Queen. \"...that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights...\" You mentioned that, but you failed to mention that christians have always been willing to deny any and all rights of anyone who did not conform to christian dogma. That Creator, by the way, is merely Nature, that had been previously mentioned. Typical of deist humanism. \"...that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" Certainly not christian. Christians have always been ever willing to deprive anyone of life and liberty just because they weren't christians. Still true.\n \n And a final point, Calli. The Declaration of INdependence is not a founding document of the United States. It is a statement of the reasons for the break away from Great Britain. One might claim that the Articles of Confederation were founding documents, but they were cast aside as unworkable in favor of the Constitution. The Constitution is the founding document of our country.\n \n So please, anyone who thinks that this is a christian nation, explain why there is no mention of God or Jesus in the Constitution. Why is it that the only mention of religion is in the form of a prohibition. Please cite specific constitutional articles and the specific Biblical passages on which they are based. Mere assertion is meaningless so you will need to support that with some rational argument or historical citation. Otherwise it is flatulence.",

   "The first amendment guarantees religious freedom. The Bible says that idol worshippers should be put to death (Deuteronomy 17:2-5). So we know that the first amendment certainly wasn't based on the Bible. \n \n On the other hand, the 18th amendment of the Constitution which prohibited the \"manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors\" did have Christian origins. Many churches advocated abstinence from alcohol. In 1918, over 500,000 thousand people died from influenza in the US. Many Christian leaders of the day said that God was punishing Americans for their sins. High among this list of sins was alcohol consumption. The 18th amendment was passed in 1920. http://www.mcwilliams.com/books/books/aint/402.htm\n \n The Bible doesn't actually prohibit alcohol consumption. Jesus actually drank wine.

   "What would your definition of a Christian nation be lurch?\n \n Why would my definition of a \"christian nation\" be important? I really don't see one. Maybe the closest was something like the feudal monarchies of the middle ages. They had an abosolute intolerance for other religions. Most colonies were origionally founded as economic ventures - to make money. Maybe they were founded on christian principles. I notice the religion has become big business, complete with curio shops on the way out. I'm not too sure that is what Christ had in mind though.\n \n Perhaps the Puritans are what it is like. They came here for religious freedom, didn't they? Of course what you think of religion and what they thought of as freedom of religion aren't the same. I presume you think of it as everyone having the right to practice their own religion. The Puritans thought of it as the right to be free to impose their religion on everyone. They even executed a few dissenters.\n \n So I don't actually know what a christian nation might be. Even nations that claimed to be christian seldom were. But certainly, the founding document of our nation would mention God or Jesus, don't you think? And wouldn't the official religion of a christian nation be christianity?\n \n But never fret. We're getting there. We now have attempts to take your tax money and give it to (approved) churches to offer services to the deprived. And of course, we are told that there will be no effort to proselytize (other than the religious symbols, the clergy and the \"witnessing\" of the staff). So now an act of Christian charity, an obligation of a Christian, will be taken over by the government - and christian churches will be supported in their proselytizing efforts by tax money. The question is, which \"faith based\" organizations are eligable. How about Wiccan organizations? How about Satanism? Are their \"churches\" eligable?\n \n But lets get back to the question. I notice that you didn't offer a single Biblical quotation in support of the Constitution. For example, what is the Biblical basis for \"but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States?\" Exactly what christian principle is that based on?

   "Why is your definition important? So I know what we are debating, if anything. \n \n Your definition of a \"christian nation\" seems to be one that 1) has an established state religion, Christianity, and 2) a marked intolerance toward any belief contrary to the established religion. I would have to agree, by your definition, America is not a Christian Nation. \n \n The Puritains did not come to America for religious freedom. They came to have their own religion become the established religion of the government. \n \n The founding documents would indeed mention their deity... unless they considered it so obvious as to not warrant mention. If you read the state constitutions, you will find a different story. Since the states gave authority to the federal government, the fact that the state constitutions acknowledge God must count for something. \n \n I am as much against the federal government giving money to churches as you are, though perhaps for different reasons. When the government gives you money, they are allowed to dictate how you will spend it, and begin to make policy for you. (Wyman v. James 400 U.S. 309 [1971])\n \n The reason i didn't offer any biblical citations was because if your definition could kill the question before it got that far, there was no point in my putting any effort into it. THAT is why I didn't answer your earlier points, because I wanted to make sure of the question before committing myself. \n \n About self-evident truth: It may suprise you that there are Biblical passages that show there is self-evident truth. Read Romans 1:19-20. If man is \"without excuse\" there must be truths that are self evident. \n \n Finally, about the Treaty of Tripoli: I will quote Dr. Alan Snyder, professor of American history at Patrick Henry College: \n \n \"First, if you look carefully at the text of the treaty, article 11 simply says that the government of the U.S. is not founded on the Christian religion. In the context of what is meant here, it is only a statement that we have no official religion at the national level. That is historically accurate. Some people try to make it more than that--a repudiation of Christianity. I see no reason for that assertion. It's no different, in context, than the constitutional provision that says there is no religious test for holding office...\n \n There is even some evidence that it is not really an official part of the treaty. According to John Eisdmoe, quoting from Treaties and Other International Agreements of the USA, there was some Arabic text between articles 10 and 12 that said something to this effect, but it was in the form of a note from one Arabic official to another, not with a number 11 on it. One might have been simply informing another that the US did not have an official Christian church--which, of course, was much different than the European countries with which they dealt...\n \n Again, I think it's just a simple statement that we have no official national religion within the government.\"",

   "Excuses that article 11 were not part of the \"official\" treaty don't hold water. That clause was in the version that was ratified by the Senate and the version that Adams signed.\n \n And it says that the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion. It doesn't talk about the States but the federal government.\n \n I notice that you can't actually point out any of the Christian principles from the Bible. I don't think your reference quite does the trick. Claiming that a reference to the nature of God means that \"all men are created equal\" is a bit of a stretch.\n \n Yep. Most of the states did have established churches - several different sects. So the framers of the Constitution chose not to found the federal government on any of them. Besides, estimates of the number of people that actually attended church in 1776 are in the range of 17% and less. Not much of a Christian nation I'm afraid. Even now that number is up to about 40% or a little more.\n \n Well. Nice try at giving me one Bible verse that supports one phrase from the document that declared our independence, if you stretch it enough. How about unalienable rights to life and liberty? Got anything on that one? How about, \"all men are created equal?\" How about governments deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed?\n \n But that's not really the founding document of our country. The Constitution is. So far no one has linked any of the articles from the Constitution to some Christian principle, much less cited a passage from the Bible to support it.\n \n And of course you have expressed one reason why the 1st Amendment is so important. If the church takes government money, then they have to follow rules set by the government on how that money will be used. But our President doesn't seem to be bright enough to realize that. Or he is planning to do away with the 1st Amendment and establish a christian nation.\n \n Actually, a \"Christian nation\" would look a whole lot like Taliban governed Afghanistan - just a different religion.

   "Why do you think Article 11 was part of the treaty that the Senate ratified?\n \n At any rate, it doesn't matter because we both believe the federal government doesn't have an established religion, which was your definition included. \n \n You didn't ask me to provide passages of scripture that support the principles found in the Constitution, and so I didn't. Since we agreed that America is not a Christian nation in as much as it has no state religion, I found it unecessary. If you'd like me to do so, I'll dig in. \"Can't\" was the wrong word. I chose not to.\n \n My refrence wasn't at all connected to \"all men are created equal,\" but rather to the \"self-evident truth.\" You asked me for a single passage in the Bible that supported self-evident truth, not the fact that \"all men are created equal.\" I did so. I was in no way trying to make my passage sound like it supported \"all men are created equal.\" I do not understand how you got that idea. \n \n You take church attendence as a measure of the Christianity of their time? I'm afraid I cannot see how that is an accurate measure. Most of the Christians I know do not attend established churches. Obviously, they wouldn't appear in the statistics. I'm sure that was more true back in 1776. \n \n All men are created equal: Acts 17:26; Colossians 3:11; 1 Corinthians 7:19, Galatians 5:6 and 6:15, circumcision is a mark of being a Jew, as apposed to a gentile; Romans 10:12; 1 Corinthians 12:13; Galatians 3:28.\n \n Unalienable right to life: Genesis 9:5-6; Exodus 21:10; Leviticus 24:17. Surely such extreme punishments for murder show that we have a right to life. \n \n Unalienable right to liberty: Exodus 21:16; Deuteronomy 24:7\n \n As to civil governments deriving their powers from the consent of the governed: Deuteronomy 17:14-20 and 28:36. God expects the people to choose their leaders. \n \n Even if you don't think the Declaration was the founding document of our nation, surely it must carry some weight as being the first document issued by the infant nation. \n \n Most of the rules in the Constitution are rules of who does what. I don't suppose you are looking for a Bible verse that says \"Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be ncessary... etc. etc.\" Some of the rules set forth in the Constitutions are rules of order and expediency. I don't see a bible verse that says \"Thou shalt have a bicameral legislature\" but I don't think such a verse is necessary. \n \n Having said that, there are several principles that are directly supported by the Bible. I think Isaiah 33:22 supports the 3 branches of government idea: Legislature, Judicial, and Executive branches. At the very least, it recognizes that there are 3 functions of government. The principle that taxes are to be given to the government is found in Matthew 22:15-22, Mark 12:13-17, Luke 20:26, Romans 13:6-7. I could go on, but my 1000 charachters are rapidly running out. \n \n One final word... if you think that Old Testament Israel was anything like the Taliban, I'm afraid you haven't read the Law very closely. There are many differences between Muslim Law (is it called Sharia law?? I forget...) and Old Testament Law.",

They have no problem with forcing their religion on everyone. The have no problem in declaring themselves the holders of truth.

After all, this nation was \"founded on Christian principles\" and if I don't like it I can go to Iraq or Iran or wherever the current christian boogie man is.\n \n All of your Bible cites are a bit of a stretch. And they certainly weren't the basis of the phrases in the Declaration. Jefferson was certainly not a Christian. Jefferson's God spoke through nature rather than through scripture.\n \n I have a book written by two professors from Cornell, Isaac Kramnick (government) and R. Laurence Moore (history). They comment, \"Some of the founding fathers fretted that Americans weren't much interested in religion and most definitely weren't securely Christian. ... It is no surprise, then, that Americans in the era of the Revolution were a distinctly unchurched people. The highest estimates for the late eighteenth century make only about 10-15 percent of the population church members.\"\n \n And isn't it humorous that you think that the lack of attendence at church is a sign of a Christian nation?\n \n But at least you agree the the document upon which our government is founded is not based on christian principles. At least you are wise enough to see that. The fundies who make the christian nation claims usually just shut up and go away, only to make the same claim in another thread. They never answer.",

But he was more familiar with the Greek and Roman clasics and the writers of the Enlightenment.\n \n But one the the teachings of Christ was community (Matt 18:20 and others). That's what Christians are to do. And today fundamentalists frequently tell me of the moral decline of our nation from those christian standards upon which it was founded. And yet the highest estimate of the christian population that I have seen was been 17%, and they range down to 4%, mostly 10 to 15%. But church attendance is as high as it has ever been, with numbers given between 40 to 60%.\n \n Now I don't claim that none of the founding fathers were Christians, nor do I claim that the foundations of the government were without their influence or approval.

   "I wonder if you would be so good as to support that assertion. You see, the form of the federal government was the brainchild of James Madison. After a search of his writings (all 4 volumes) I found that he mentioned the Bible but a single time, denying a story printed in a newspaper in 1831 the he had read the Bible every Sabbath during his first term at the Department of State but given it up during his second. Never in any of his writings did Madison mention Jesus or the Trinity, and he mentioned God 17 times from 1769 to 1836. Two of those mentions are in \"A Memorial and Remonstrance\" (you've read it, of course). Those are the only ones prior to the writing of the Constitution.\n \n There are two mentions of God in the Journal of the Federal Convention, which was written by James Madison.\n \n The first was the motion by Franklin (on June 28,1787) to begin the sessions each day with a prayer. Isn't it interesting that the Conventiion began on May 14, 1787 and the motion by Franklin didn't come until the 30th session? Wouldn't you think that these Christian gentlemen would have thought of it sooner since they were writing a document based on Christian principles? Isn't it interesting that the motion was opposed by one of our Christian founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton? Hamilton expressed two reasons for opposing the measure. First, because of the many delegates disagreed with the motion. To use Madison's words, \"able animadversions,\" that is to say, thoughtful adverse criticism.\n \n The second is in words attributed by Madison to Gouverneur Morris on July 7th. He is quoted as saying, \"Good God, Sir, is it possible they can so delude themselves?\" I don't think that is quite what you have in mind.\n \n I might also point out that the United States doesn't have a king and one isn't mentioned in the Constitution. It is also true that God, Jesus, trinity, or Bible are not mentioned.\n \n I know you mentioned only that the Constitution is derived from scripture, but you cite the old testament which means that it is Hebrew scripture rather than Christian.\n \n But still, unless you can somehow support your assertion with some actual logical connection between Madison or anyone at the Constitutional Convention and the Bible, your assertion is only that, an assertion with no basis in fact.\n \n Actually, here is what I think.\n \n In the more than 200 years that our country has been around, the longest time that any republic has existed in the history of the world, the ideas of our Declaration of Independence and of our Constitution and Bill of Rights have come to be respected and revered by the people of the United States. This is true even of Christians in spite of the fact that the strongest opposition to the ratification of the Constitution came from Christians, precisely because the Constitution was viewed as Godless. That view held until the 1840s and later. And now we find that fundamentalist christians are claiming the Constitution as their own, based on the principles of their religion.\n \n Well, the Constitution has been around for a bit longer than fundamentlism. I think that the case is quite the opposite. I think that American fundamentalists are so blinded by their extreme tunnel vision that they claim anything honorable, moral and good as coming from their religion. In fact, it is not the Constitution that is based on the principles of Christianity, it is American fundamentalism that is based on the Constitution.",

   "Originally posted by Benjamin \n The whole concept of the three fold branches of government where derived from the Scriptures. They certianly weren't thought up by Arostatle, although he was starting to come up with some sophisticated theorums in regards to government polocies. It wasn't the mind of Socrates, nor his well known student Plato.

The Declaration of Independence was based on the ideas of the English philosopher John Locke. Locke said that all men have basic and natural rights and that when a government abuses these rights, it is the right of the people to overthrow the government and institute a new government. Locke also said that the government derives its power from the consent of the governed. \n \n The concept of the government being divided into the legislative, judicial, and executive branches came from the French philosopher, Montesquieu. \"In  The Spirit of Laws, published in 1748, Montesquieu advocated separating and balancing powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government as a means of guaranteeing the freedom of the individual.\"\n http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/whatsdem/whatdm11.htm",

Of course, all of the delegates were well educated and well read in the literature of the enlightenment. They had all read Adam Smith, Jacques Necker, Malachai Postlethwayt, David Hume, Rene Descartes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and (of course) John Locke.\n \n And, as you point out, Tim, certain phrases from the Declaration are extracted directly from Locke (life, liberty and the pursuit of...), and certain ideas are paraphrased (unalienable rights, power of government from the consent of the governed, and the right to overthrow an unjust government).\n \n And that doesn't even consider the primacy of nature as the voice of God or self evident truth.\n \n If all of that is true then I guess we must conclude that the U.S. in founded on humanist principles.\n \n I must confess that I have never read Montesquieu.

Social darwinism is a the term applied to the ideas of the English philosopher, Herbert Spencer. Spencer actually published his work before Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" and the term \"social Darwinism\" was later applied to the philosophy. Spencer was also coined the phrase \"survival of the fittest,\" which Darwin didn't like because it doesn't express the complexity of the theory of natural selection. Because of popular use and because of the urging of Wallace, Darwin finally used the phrase in the 4th edition of \"Origin\", and then it was always associated with the words \"natural selection.\"\n \n It is a characteristic of christian fundamentalists to confuse natural selection with social Darwinism.

The ideas you have just stated ARE social Darwinism, not the ideas of evolution extended to us. You are [incorrectly] extending social Darwinism to the theory of natural selection. Natural selection has to do with the tendency of those organisms that are most adapted to their environment to survive to reproduce. Rarely does it have to do with \"strong\" or \"weak.\" It is a matter of possessing advantageous characteristics in a given environment. In other words, you've got it backwards. You are trying to apply a social philosophy that predates publication of \"On The Origin of Species\" and was developed by Herbert Spencer to the science of evolution. \"Survival of the fittest\" is Spencer's idea, not Darwin's. Darwin didn't like it and ALWAYS used the phrase in conjunction with his term, \"natural selection,\" and even then he first used it in the 4th edition of his book.

Creationists love to express evolution in those terms and then claim that it is some sort of moral imperative for evolutionists. I see it all the time. Creationists claim that evolutionists are in favor of killing the weak because that's what evolution means in their cartoon version. That's why the hitler troll is so offensive. He is playing on that distorted view that creationists have of science.\n \n Perhaps it comes from the way I got used to discussing it so many years ago when I was in school. We were made aware of \"survival of the fittest\" from the very begining and the complete inadequacy of the phrase in expressing the principles of natural selection. That's why Darwin objected to the phrase applied to his theory. He only began using it after it had come into common usage (4th edition). The substitution of the word \"strong\" to mean fit and \"weak\" to mean unfit is totally misleading, not to mention the ambiguity of the words \"fit\" and \"unfit.\"\n \n Natural selection is statistical. Those organisms that have a combination of traits that make them better adapted to their environment tend to live long enough to reproduce more frequently than those that don't. It is even conceivable that adaptive traits are mutually exclusive - perhaps big is an advantage over small and perhaps fast is an advantage over slow - perhaps it is also true that there is no big and fast. So survival may be determined by any and all of thousands of other genetic characteristics.\n \n It is even true that a characteristic that appears to be disadvangageous turns out to be the advantage that increases one's chance for survival in a particular environment.",
