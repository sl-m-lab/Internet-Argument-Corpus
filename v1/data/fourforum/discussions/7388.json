By December 1984, 2.4% of the men had the syndrome; mortality attributable to the syndrome in 1984 was 600/100 000. For each man with the syndrome in a representative sample of 474 cohort members seen in 1984, 7.5 men had generalized lymphadenopathy, 1.1 had other prodromal findings, and 0.8 had hematologic abnormalities. Prevalence of serum antibodies to HTLV-III/LAV, measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, increased from 4.5% in 1978 to 67.4% in 1984. Of 31 persons who were seropositive and without the syndrome between 1978 and 1980, 2 developed the syndrome and 8 developed related conditions during a median follow-up of 61 months. Over a 6-year period, two thirds of cohort members were infected with HTLV-III/LAV and almost one third developed related conditions.\n\n \n Now, who's ignorant again?",

Well, okay!\n \n Here, let me teach you something.\n \n \nReductio ad absurdum (Latin for \"reduction to the absurd\", traceable back to the Greek &#951;&#788; &#949;&#953;&#962; &#940;&#964;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#957; &#945;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#951; (hi eis \u00e1topon apagogi), \"reduction to the impossible\", often used by Aristotle), also known as an apagogical argument or reductio ad impossibile, is a type of logical argument where we assume a claim for the sake of argument, arrive at an absurd result, and then conclude the original assumption must have been wrong, since it gave us this absurd result. This is also known as proof by contradiction. \n (emphasis added, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum) \n\n \n Here we go...\n \n 1) Assume for the sake of argument that God -- the one and only all-powerful, all-knowing, all-righteous, supernatural being -- exists, as is claimed in the Bible. \n \n 2) Now note how that, according to this very same Bible, this God killed thousands upon thousands of people - all humans except Noah and his family, all inhabitants of Sodom and Gomohra (spelling?) except Lot and his family, some dude for \"spilling his seed on the ground\", Pharaoh for acts that God himself FORCED Pharaoh to do, and allowed Satan to kill Job's servants for what God himself said was NO REASON AT ALL.\n \n 3) We have a contradiction and/or an absurd result: a being that does those unethical things is NOT all-righteous.\n \n 4) Hence, the original assumption - that the all-righteous God the Bible claims exists - is wrong: that God does not exist.\n \n \n Now, one can try to attack the claims that make up the implicit logical argument, but the use of this mode of argumentation is quite common and valid.

U.S.) The inmate's conviction on attempted murder was upheld. \n a Florida HIV-positive prostitute was convicted of attempted murder for biting a man after a dispute about money (Morrison v. State) The man tested positive for HIV six months later, but the CDC had to be called in to verify that the HIV strain was exactly the same as the prostitute's. \n a Georgia court upheld a conviction for attempted murder when an HIV-positive man bit a police officer who was administering a choke hold (Scroggins v. State).

   "I think religion is often used as a justification, but in most cases I believe that deeper underlying prejudices or emotion was the root cause. Even in more famous cases like the Salem witch trials, it was fear. In times of the church's power, it was greed and a desire for power. With the crusades, it was fear (of eternal torment, used by the pope to motivate people) or political alignment, In other cases it's been bitterness and revenge.\n \n I would say that rarely has God ever been THE reason someone was killed. More often it's been an excuse or justification.\n\n \n \n Which is even more reason to keep the wall between church and state strong.

Because God forced Pharaoh to do so!\n \n \nThen the Lord said to Moses, \"Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. They are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal Zephon. Pharaoh will think, 'The Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion, hemmed in by the desert.' And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue them. But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord.\" So the Israelites did this.\n \n When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, \"What have we done? We have let the Israelites go and have lost their services!\" So he had his chariot made ready and took his army with him. He took six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them. The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out boldly.\n (emphasis added, Exodus 14:1-8)\n \n\n \n So it was God's PLAN - God's INTENT - God's DOING. God is the reason Pharaoh pursued the Israelites, after he had just set them free.\n \n And WHY did God force Pharaoh to pursue the Israelites?\n \n \nThen the Lord said to Moses, \"Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. They are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal Zephon. Pharaoh will think, 'The Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion, hemmed in by the desert.' And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue them. But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord.\"\n (emphasis added, Exodus 14:1-4)\n \n \n \n God wanted to gain glory for Himself through the death of Pharaoh and his army. \n \n And God doesn't state that as His reason just one time. \n \n \nThen the Lord said to Moses, \"Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on. Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide it the water so that the Israelites can go through on dry ground. I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. And I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen. The Egyptians will know that I am the Lord when I gain glory through Pharaoh, his chariots and horsemen.\"\n (emphasis added, Exodus 14:15-18)\n \n\n \n The Holy Bible tells us that God's purpose for having Pharaoh and his army pursue the Israelites is so that God can kill them ... so that GOD CAN GAIN GLORY THROUGH THEIR DEATHS! \n \n And the Holy Bible goes on to tell us that God's premeditated killing spree did achieve it's goal. For once it was achieved, the Israelites did in fact give glory to God for his premeditated killing spree!\n \n \nThen Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD:\n \n \"I will sing to the LORD,\n for he is highly exalted.\n The horse and its riders\n he has hurled into the sea.\n ...\n The LORD is a warrior;\n The LORD is his name.\n Pharaoh's chariots and his army\n he has hurled into the sea.\n The best of Pharaoh's officers\n are drowned in the Red Sea.\n The deep waters have covered them;\n they sank to the depths like a stone.\n \n ...\n You unleashed your burning anger;\n it consumed them like stubble.\n (Exodus 15:1-7)\n \n\n \n God could have freed the Israelites from the Egyptians in any number of ways: He could have achieved His \"free my people\" goal without all of the killing. But He chose not to: God also wanted to gain GLORY for Himself through the deaths of the Egyptians. Sure, how better to gain glory than to kill a whole bunch of people!

Does this story reflect historical reality? Can we find extra-biblical and/or archeological evidence in support of this story? \n \n First, let's establish the time frame. The biblical account in 1 Kings 6:1 dates the Exodus to about 1440 BCE in the Late Bronze age (LB). Right away, problems crop up. Exodus 1:11 tells us that the Hebrews were forced to construct the city of Raamses, but the first pharaoh with that name came to the throne in 1320 BCE, more than a century after the biblical date of the Exodus. Also, despite the fact that the ancient Egyptians kept good records, there exists no Egyptian record of a concentration of Hebrews living in the eastern delta, as implied by Genesis 47:27. Indeed, there are no Egyptian records relating to an extensive Hebrew presence in Egypt at all. Furthermore, during this time period (LB), Egypt was in control not only of the Sinai, but of Canaan, as well. Egypt had fortifications throughout the entire region, extending as far north as the border with what is now Syria, making it unlikely that a large group of Hebrews could have entered the region without meeting Egyptian opposition.\n \n According to the Exodus account (12:37-38), the freed Hebrews numbered almost two million (600 thousand men as well as women, children, and the elderly, not to mention cattle, sheep, etc.), and wandered in the Sinai for forty years. However, archeologists have been unable to uncover a single campsite or sign of occupation within the Sinai during this (LB) period - no pot sherds, no bones, no encampements, nothing. \n \n The Bible (Deut. 1:46, 2:14) tells us that these Hebrews spent a considerable amount of time (perhaps 38 out of 40 years) encamped in and around Kadesh-barnea in the Sinai. The location of this site is set in Num. 34. Repeated excavations within this area have not provided the slightest evidence of occupation during the LB. Ezion-geber is another such site identified in the Bible, and again, no trace of LB occupation has been discovered. \n \n What does this tell us? It suggests that the dates and places mentioned in the Exodus story do not relate to the time of the Exodus as given in the Bible. Quoting from the authors...\n \n The most evocative and consistent geographical details of the Exodus story come from the seventh century BCE, during the great era of the prosperity of the kingdom of Judah - six centuries after the events of the Exodus were supposed to have taken place. All of the major places that play a role in the story of the wandering of the Israelites were inhabited in the seventh century; in some cases they were occupied only at that time.\n \n The Bible tells us that Moses sent agents from Kadesh-barnea to the king of Edom to ask permission to pass through the country on the way to Canaan (Num 20:14-21). The king refused. Archeological investigations suggest that Edom reached statehood only under Assyrian rule sometime in the seventh century BCE. Before that, it was a backwater. \n \n Again, this seventh century era keeps popping up in archeological and historical investigations. But by this time, Judah was already established as an Israelite settlement.\n \n This material is dated circa 2000.\n \n \nNext....\n\n \n LOL!",

Egypt had fortifications throughout the entire region, extending as far north as the border with what is now Syria, making it unlikely that a large group of Hebrews could have entered the region without meeting Egyptian opposition.\n \n According to the Exodus account (12:37-38), the freed Hebrews numbered almost two million (600 thousand men as well as women, children, and the elderly, not to mention cattle, sheep, etc.), and wandered in the Sinai for forty years. However, archeologists have been unable to uncover a single campsite or sign of occupation within the Sinai during this (LB) period - no pot sherds, no bones, no encampements, nothing. \n \n The Bible (Deut. 1:46, 2:14) tells us that these Hebrews spent a considerable amount of time (perhaps 38 out of 40 years) encamped in and around Kadesh-barnea in the Sinai. The location of this site is set in Num. 34. Repeated excavations within this area have not provided the slightest evidence of occupation during the LB. Ezion-geber is another such site identified in the Bible, and again, no trace of LB occupation has been discovered. \n \n What does this tell us? It suggests that the dates and places mentioned in the Exodus story do not relate to the time of the Exodus as given in the Bible. Quoting from the authors...\n \n The most evocative and consistent geographical details of the Exodus story come from the seventh century BCE, during the great era of the prosperity of the kingdom of Judah - six centuries after the events of the Exodus were supposed to have taken place. All of the major places that play a role in the story of the wandering of the Israelites were inhabited in the seventh century; in some cases they were occupied only at that time.\n \n The Bible tells us that Moses sent agents from Kadesh-barnea to the king of Edom to ask permission to pass through the country on the way to Canaan (Num 20:14-21). The king refused. Archeological investigations suggest that Edom reached statehood only under Assyrian rule sometime in the seventh century BCE. Before that, it was a backwater. \n \n Again, this seventh century era keeps popping up in archeological and historical investigations. But by this time, Judah was already established as an Israelite settlement.\n \n This material is dated circa 2000.\n \n LOL!\n\n \n Yuk it up. \n \n Refuting Finkelstein\n \n Who Destroyed Megiddo? Was It David or Shishak?\n \n \n http://www.bib-arch.org/bswb_BAR/bswbba2906f1.html\n \n \n http://www.accuracyingenesis.com/solomon.html\n \n C14 dating affirms Scripture/Scripture affirms C14 dating!\n \n Deep in the ruins of a Hebrew town sacked nearly 3,000 years ago by an Egyptian Pharaoh, scientists say they have discovered new evidence for the real-life existence of the Bible's legendary kingdoms of David and Solomon. \n \n The evidence refutes recent claims by other researchers who insist that the biblical monarchs were merely mythic characters, created by scholars and scribes of antiquity who made up the tales long after the events to buttress their own morality lessons. \n \n The debate, however, is not likely to subside, for archaeology is a field notable for its lengthy quarrels among partisans, however scientific they may be.\n \n The latest evidence comes from Israeli and Dutch archaeologists and physicists after seven years of digging at a historic site called Tel Rehov. The site is in the Jordan valley of Israel, where successive settlements rose and fell over the centuries.\n \n Using highly sophisticated techniques for establishing dates through the decay rate of radioactive carbon, the scientists have pinned down the time of a disputed moment in history, recorded in the Bible, when a Pharaoh now known as Shoshenq I invaded Jerusalem. \n \n As the book of Chronicles relates in the Old Testament, Shoshenq (the Bible called him Shishak) came \"with twelve hundred chariots and threescore thousand horsemen\" and plundered Israel's capital, as well as such towns and fortresses as Rehov, Megiddo and Hazor. \n \n The Pharaoh later listed those conquests on a monument in the temple of Amun at Karnak, where the Egyptian city of Luxor now stands. \n \n The new timetable places Shoshenq's rampage and looting at Rehov in the 10th century rather than the 9th, a highly significant difference. It sets the date at about 925 B.C., some five years after Solomon was said to have died, and some 80 years earlier than other archaeologists maintain. \n \n Those scholars, known in the world of archaeology as \"minimalists,\" insist that both David and Solomon were little more than tribal chieftains, and certainly not the mighty monarchs of the Bible. \n A report on the new evidence appears today in the journal Science by Hendrik Bruins, a desert researcher at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, Johannes van der Plicht of the Center for Isotope Research at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, and Amihai Mazar of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the principal archaeologist at Tel Rehov. \n \n In a telephone interview, Mazar said that one specific \"layer of destruction\" at the site yielded a harvest of charred grain seeds and olive pits that enabled his colleagues to date them with an unusually high level of precision. The dates of both earlier and later layers showed clearly how the successive layers of occupation could be determined from the 12th through the 9th centuries B.C., he said. \n \n \"They provide a precise archaeological anchor for the united monarchies of the time of David and Solomon,\" Mazar said. \"The pottery we found there also tells us that the conquest dates from the same period as Meggido, when its mighty gates and walls and temples were also destroyed by Shoshenq's armies.\" \n \n More than 40 years ago the late Yigael Yadin, who won fame as an army officer during Israel's war for independence, turned to archaeology and after excavating the imposing ruins at Megiddo maintained that they were in fact destroyed during the so-called Solomonic period. \n Recently, however, a group of archaeologists led by Israel Finkelstein of Tel Aviv University working at Megiddo has insisted that the so-called Solomon's gate there dates from a much later time -- perhaps 100 or even 200 years after Solomon. \n \n Finkelstein read a copy of the Mazar report that was sent him by e-mail. After replying that Mazar \"is a fine scholar,\" he insisted that \"there are many problems with his archaeological data\" and that the samples of material used for the radiocarbon dating are at best questionable. \n In the past, Finkelstein has accused Mazar of harboring a \"sentimental, somewhat romantic approach to the archaeology of the Iron Age,\" according to an earlier account in Science.\n \n On Thursday, however, one of the leaders in the archaeology of Israel, Professor Lawrence E. Stager, who is director of Harvard University's Semitic Museum, dismissed the claims of Finkelstein and the other archaeologists who share his views. \n \n \"Mazar and his colleagues have now put another nail in the coffin of Finkelstein's theories,\" Stager said. \"There's no question that Rehov and the other cities that Shoshenq conquered were indeed there at the time of Solomon. \n \n \"We don't need to rely any more only on the Bible or on Shoshenq's inscriptions at Karnak to establish that Solomon and his kingdom really existed, because we now have the superb evidence of the radiocarbon dates.\" \n \n http://www.accuracyingenesis.com/solomon.html\n \n Next....",

   "Even if those determinations are the result of myth and folklore, from another culture, and that such determinations lack (your favourite phrase) \"credible evidence\"? BTW, what exactly are 'libs'?\n \n I posted this awhile back and I've not revisited it since, but I thought it might be informative...\n \n \"The Bible Unearthed\" - Exodus\n \n Re: The Bible Unearthed, Finkelstein & Silberman, Free Press Pub.\n \n These two authors, one an archeologist and the other a historian, have published a book which draws attention to some striking discrepancies between certain Bible narratives vs. recent archeological and historical findings. By recent, I mean within the last hundred years. \n \n Israel Finkelstein - Director of the Institute of Archeology at Tel Aviv University.\n \n Neil Asher Silberman - Director of historical interpretation for the Ename Center for Public Archeology in Belgium and a contributing editor to Archeology magazine.\n \n The book of Exodus describes the labours of Hebrew slaves in Egypt, their eventual liberation at the hand of Moses, and the subsequent wanderings of these people in Sinai for forty years. Does this story reflect historical reality? Can we find extra-biblical and/or archeological evidence in support of this story? \n \n First, let's establish the time frame. The biblical account in 1 Kings 6:1 dates the Exodus to about 1440 BCE in the Late Bronze age (LB). Right away, problems crop up. Exodus 1:11 tells us that the Hebrews were forced to construct the city of Raamses, but the first pharaoh with that name came to the throne in 1320 BCE, more than a century after the biblical date of the Exodus.\n\n Solomon lived in the 900's BC. His temple was built 440 years after the Exodus. That puts the Exodus in the 1300's BC. Seti began the rebuilding of the Hyksos capital Avaris during his reign (1309 - 1290BC) and it was continued by his son, Ramses II (1290-1244BC) It was Ramses II that Moses dealt with.\n \n\n Also, despite the fact that the ancient Egyptians kept good records, there exists no Egyptian record of a concentration of Hebrews living in the eastern delta, as implied by Genesis 47:27. Indeed, there are no Egyptian records relating to an extensive Hebrew presence in Egypt at all. Furthermore, during this time period (LB), Egypt was in control not only of the Sinai, but of Canaan, as well. Egypt had fortifications throughout the entire region, extending as far north as the border with what is now Syria, making it unlikely that a large group of Hebrews could have entered the region without meeting Egyptian opposition.\n\n Prior to the Exodus, Hebrews lived in peace amongst the Egyptians. In fact, Joseph, one of Jacobs 12 sons (The 12 Tribes of Israel's patriarchs) rose to the position of prime minister of Egypt, second in power only to the pharoah himself. (Recall the musical \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\" was the story of Joseph.) \n It wasn't until after Joseph's death and the rise of a new king of Egypt that didn't know Joseph that the Hebrews lost favor. At the beginning of the 18th Dynasty, Ahmose I expelled the Hyksos, but not all of the Semites were driven out. Over the next 300 years, (1600's - 1300's BC) the pharoahs needed cheap labor and conscripted the services of 'Apiru (Habiru), a term for Hebrews (not necessarily Jacob's ancestors, though). Egyptian documents verify this.\n \n\n According to the Exodus account (12:37-38), the freed Hebrews numbered almost two million (600 thousand men as well as women, children, and the elderly, not to mention cattle, sheep, etc.), and wandered in the Sinai for forty years. However, archeologists have been unable to uncover a single campsite or sign of occupation within the Sinai during this (LB) period - no pot sherds, no bones, no encampements, nothing. \n\n The 600,000 number is clearly not an accurate count because the Bible also states that there were only 2 midwives to handle all of the Hebrew colony (Exodus1:15-20)\n \n\n The Bible (Deut. 1:46, 2:14) tells us that these Hebrews spent a considerable amount of time (perhaps 38 out of 40 years) encamped in and around Kadesh-barnea in the Sinai. The location of this site is set in Num. 34. Repeated excavations within this area have not provided the slightest evidence of occupation during the LB. Ezion-geber is another such site identified in the Bible, and again, no trace of LB occupation has been discovered.\n\n What do you think the chances of finding the remains of a small band of escaped slaves wandering around in the desert for 40 years over 3000 years later are? Also, the probable path taken was along the Suez Canal to Mt. Sanai and up Gulf of Aqabah before arriving at Kadesh-barnea. Runaway slaves wouldn't have made themselves known to those living in larger population centers and would stay in the wilderness, consistent with the Bible's account. \n \n\n What does this tell us? It suggests that the dates and places mentioned in the Exodus story do not relate to the time of the Exodus as given in the Bible. Quoting from the authors...\n \n The most evocative and consistent geographical details of the Exodus story come from the seventh century BCE, during the great era of the prosperity of the kingdom of Judah - six centuries after the events of the Exodus were supposed to have taken place. All of the major places that play a role in the story of the wandering of the Israelites were inhabited in the seventh century; in some cases they were occupied only at that time.\n \n The Bible tells us that Moses sent agents from Kadesh-barnea to the king of Edom to ask permission to pass through the country on the way to Canaan (Num 20:14-21). The king refused. Archeological investigations suggest that Edom reached statehood only under Assyrian rule sometime in the seventh century BCE. Before that, it was a backwater.\n\n \n Archeological surveys, 1932-1943, suggested that agricultural kingdoms were established around 1300's BC in Edom, Moab and Ammon, consistent with the Bible's account of Exodus. \n \n\n Again, this seventh century era keeps popping up in archeological and historical investigations. But by this time, Judah was already established as an Israelite settlement.\n\n That's because the size of the original slave population was overstated. Small kingdoms would be formidable against a small band of escaped slaves, but not against a 600,000 man hebrew nation.\n \n I didn't cite any references because I did a lot of paraphrasing from an old college textbook entitled \"Understanding the Old Testament\" by Dr.Bernhard W. Anderson, PhD Yale.\n ",

Sodom and Gomorrah are not amoung them (despite your claims). \n \n WHen it comes to the claims about the bible, you will find that the closer it is to the 1st century, the more likely it is to have evidence of it.\n \n The link you had with 'sodom and gomorriah' is just plain junk science. You will not find those claims in a peer reviewed archelogical journal. There is a lot of junk archelogy out there.\n\n \n There are lots of other sites with the same type of info WRT S&G.

However, you won't find any VALID archelogicoal source who says that it has actually been found. When it comes to biblical archelogy, you will find a lot of psuedo-archelogical claims. You will even find people who claim that Noah's ark has been found. (they never can back it up with hard evidence though).\n \n \n I mean.. what can I think of someone who puts the 'wyatt museum' and 'accuracy in genesis' at resources.??\n \n \n I will also note that your varous sources disagree with each other about where Sodom and Gomorrah are, and the dates it was 'discovered'. That\n should tell you something right there.",
