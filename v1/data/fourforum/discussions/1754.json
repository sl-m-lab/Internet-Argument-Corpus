   "Senator Joseph Lieberman is a good example of a Jewish person?s religious indoctrination and the possible conflict of what is in the best interest of American policies. The first time in American history a person religious indoctrination became an issue was when John F. Kennedy ran for President in 1960 as the first Irish Catholic President of the United States. There are many similarities to the concerns of the American people on the perception of a person?s religious beliefs in their decision process on national and international issues. \n \n When religion is brought up, the religious antis extremes on both sides appear in force clouding the real issues. If the United States was a second or third rated power in global politics and policies it might not matter much. Religion, money and the greed of a few people are at the root of all wars with so much money being made by a few people in war but the same can?t be said for peace. War a capital-intensive industry controlled by a few people while peace is a diverse multi-level industry. The President of the United States religious beliefs as a global military super power has a dramatic impact on global issues. \n \n During President John F. Kennedy run for the White House the question whether the Vatican or the Constitution held higher ground. With the religious territorial conflict in Ireland between the Catholics and Protestants and the issue of Freedom of Choice and Right to Life there was the question of ones religious beliefs. Today the American people are faced with these same questions and more with our elected officials. This was one of the unspoken roadblocks to Senator Joseph Lieberman candidacy to the White House. If a person questions another person?s religious beliefs they are labeled an anti what ever it may be. The religious indoctrination and conditioning of a person or a nation?s beliefs is the foundation of many of the conflict and wars around the world. \n \n President John F. Kennedy and Senator Joseph Lieberman had many similarities in their lives from different sides of the road. Both men had and have great oratory skills speaking from their hearts. Their lives were and are the American dream in its fullest. They both set high standards and goal for themselves and their nation. But their religious indoctrination was and is a question on political topics that have an effect on all of us.\n \n A consequence from the deep division of the people of the world over individual religious theologies and the secular ideologies is threatening the future existence of the human race. To rule by majority might is threatening to the minority and their rights and security. The Jewish people are a culture that has greatly suffered from being the minority in many different nations throughout history . Today the Jewish people have a nation that has a first rate military force with the unconditional backing of the United States. The State of Israel being a nation with atomic military warheads that is threatening the Arab nations and beyond. The Jewish people as a culture see it quite differently being so few in numbers of people being the minority. \n \n There are more similarities between Christianity, Judaism, and Islam than there are differences yet we fight over the differences. The political game is no longer going to work if one side is the loser and the other side is the winner with the bar and standards not being the same. This is true with politic, economic, and social issues that are confronting the people of the world today. It is no longer a question whether mankind can destroy the world but how many times and when. The great global interdependence of one nation on another has help built bridges while deepening the divide of the people and nations. \n \n Around the world and in the United States it is the conservative religious right verses the secular progressive liberal with more tolerance for others and their different beliefs. This divides the people of nations and families often leading to war. Unless the United States and the people of the world move toward a universal secular platform of operations for what is in the best interest of the people of the planet. We will not be able to find an answer that will work. Living and operating by a few golden rules one being ?What is right for one side is right for the other side too.?",

   "To a large extent I agree with what you have said. However I would not vote for a Jew or an Arab because of how important the conflict is to America and the rest of the world. It has nothing to do with the religion of either, just that any decision they made concerning that conflict would be questioned from both sides.\n \n The election of President Kennedy was the first race I became involved in. I was too young to vote but remember liking him and what he said. I never considered his religion as a problem even though I heard the talk about the pope having control, even from my own family. But I never thought it would be a problem. I don&#8217;t remember the issue you raised concerning the Catholics and Protestants in Ireland even being brought up. I can&#8217;t believe the two conflicts had the same impact on America.",
