   "Now why am I not suprised tha Ariel Sharon went back on his word. Or should the naive who believed such a genocidal terrorist be the one's upset? That's great Sharon changed his position, I didn't know this was a position change. If Sharon came out and said \"We are gonna target innocent women and children.\" I would not be suprised, considering the IDF already does it. Arafat could be a target? If Sharon so choosed to kill Arafat he would. And without the U.S. official approval. See Sharon has the approval of the U.S. to do just about anything and the PR machine in the states just cleans up after the mess whenever needed. That's great though that Sharon \"releases\" himself from the commitment. I love it that the Democracy of the Middle East can just \"release\" itself from international law. I wonder when Sharon will publicly state that he \"releases\" himself from resolution 181,194,242, the fourth geneva convention, Oslo, the Roadmap, I could go on for a while. Well cheers to Democracy and the \"Security Lie\" in which Israel justifies everything, including the extermination of people in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. Brutality has never been one Sharon's weak points and he's out to show those nah sayers the truth.\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3654231.stm\n \n Remi",

Allow them to become an independent nation, establish whatever form of government they see fit, and elect who they want as a leader.
