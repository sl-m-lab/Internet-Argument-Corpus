So, a photon with mass is traveling at light speed, shouldn't it have infinite mass and a gravitational field like a Black Hole?\n \n Suppose the particle was not a photon, and we could get it to go as fast as light speed. It's supposed to have infinite mass and a gravititional field like a Black Hole... Which begs the question.... Would the Planet collapse into that particle because it has thee gravitational field of a Black Hole?\n \n The answer apparantly is no, because the meaning of \"infinite\" in terms of a gravitational field refers to only what is within the particle.\n \n I'm not sure if I phrased that correctly or the thinking is correct, but it would seem reasonable to suppose that if an itty bittty particle was going at light speed, it couldn't have infinite mass, because \"infinite\" in terms of the Universe would mean that the particle would have the mass of the Universe\n and be one hell of a Black Hole. So the thought continues that if that could be done in a lab on our planet, that the entire planet would not collapse into the particle.\n \n The word \"infinite\" is relative to the context in which the problem is stated.\n My problem at this point is to fully understand what infinite mass could mean in that and your problem's context.",

Time simply stops. \n \n This is why Einstein said that nothing could travel AT the speed of light. He didn't say it couldn't go faster (and certainly didn't say it couldn't go slower). He actually said information exchange ceases at the speed of light. This means that no matter what happened to the particle we would not be able to observe it even indirectly.",
