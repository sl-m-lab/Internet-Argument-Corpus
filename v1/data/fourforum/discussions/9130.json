   "Alright. Here is something entirely new here that I want to address and seek comments on.\n \n I just re-read a book entitled \"The National Rifle Association and the Media: The Motivating Force of Negative Coverage\" by Brian Anse Patrick (2002 Peter Lang Publishing, Inc.) I didn't write it, by the way. Still, I highly recommend the book, and I want to point out some of the findings expressed in it and get your comment on it.\n \n The book details a study performed by Mr. Patrick of potential media bias against the NRA. The book studied what the author described as representatives of the \"elite print media\" in America. Those newspapers covered were the New York Times (NYT), the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), the Washington Post (WP), the Christian Science Monitor (CSM), and the Los Angeles Times (LAT). The author decided to include these papers in the study because he believes (and I agree with him) that they are considered the elite \"papers of record\" for national news coverage-that not only do the public and political leaders read them for news, but other journalists take their cue from these papers when covering similar issues. The study covered the time period of 1990 to 1998, and from that time frame it examined nearly 1,500 articles. The articles studied covered both the NRA and HCI (now the Brady Campaign). In addition, articles covering three other well known interest groups--the ACLU, the NAACP, and the AARP--were included for comparison. Not surprisingly (to me at least), the study discovered a negative bias in media reporting of the NRA.\n \n Equally unsurprising to me, the book detailed how the NRA has used this negative media bias to suit its own ends-how the NRA has used evidence of media bias to cultivate a \"siege mentality\" which has not only brought in hundreds of thousands of new members but enabled the NRA to get its membership base more politically active. Anyone who has ever been an NRA member and been bombarded by its fundraising and political action alert letters will recognize what Mr. Patrick says about this as truth. If for no other reason, then the book is worth the purchase price for you to read and understand the reasons why the NRA has continued to be so successful in the face of media bias.\n \n But since I'm talking about media bias, let me share with you the areas of bias discovered in the study: \n \n Editorial Bias \n \n The author noted that editorial bias was not a surprising discovery since three of the papers included in the study (the NYT, the WP, and the LAT) have all taken partisan sides against private gun ownership. Here are two editorial examples: \n \n From the WP: \"The Struggle to get the right legislation controlling firearms has been long and frustrating-this paper has been involved in it for decades and we know whereof we speak. It is incredible that so many people who know better yield to the threats and blandishments of the National Rifle Association....\"\n \n From the LAT: \"The Times supports a near total ban on the manufacture and private ownership of handguns and assault weapons.\"\n \n The study found that of the five interest groups compared, the NRA by far fared the worst from the editorial pen. Examples of the attack language used included: \"NRA's paranoid stance.\" \"Social insanity\" (of NRA). \"NRA lie.\" \"Wacky.\" \"Disgraceful stealth.\" \"Criminals, terrorists, fanatics and unstable people might begin each day by giving thanks to the NRA.\" \n Interestingly, the study found that like the NRA, the ACLU, the NAACP, and the AARP each received negative editorial coverage, although no where near as often as that directed at the NRA. HCI, however, enjoyed what appears to be a privileged status in that it was not one time the target of a negative editorial (save for the very few private citizen pro-gun editorial opinions the papers would publish). \n \n Direct quotations\n \n Another area of coverage in which bias was discovered was in the frequency in which spokesmen for the several organizations were quoted. In comparing the amount of direct quotations from a spokesperson, the study found that HCI enjoyed a 2 to 1 advantage in the number of times its spokesmen were quoted over the NRA. This is something that I have noticed myself before, where the reporter starts a \"giving both sides\" news segment with a spokesman who outlines the position of the favored group, the reporter then turns to quote from or paraphrase the contrary position of the disfavored group, only to return in closing with a rebuttal from the favored group's spokesman.\n \n Pseudo-event coverage\n \n For pseudo-event coverage (that is, staged publicity events by the organizations), the study found that HCI enjoyed more than a 3 to 1 advantage in coverage of these events. Additionally, the study found that at times media reporters would who covered NRA sponsored events would write them up as attempts to \"manipulate\" public opinion and/or reporters. The study found that this type of negative news editorializing never occurred in reporting of HCI events.\n \n Use of photographs\n .\n In the use of photographs, the study found that HCI enjoyed a 2 to 1 advantage in the use of positive photographs of events and/or public officers when the organizations received media reporting. \n \n Use of proper names/titles\n \n In the area of correctly identifying organizational titles of persons covered, HCI held a nearly 3 to 1 advantage in this regard. Examples are referring to the head of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action with the negative term \"chief lobbyist,\" while correctly identifying HCI's counterpart with that organization's title of \"legislative director for HCI.\"\n \n Human interest stories\n \n In the area of personalization (the \"human interest\" story), the majority of personalized news articles were negative to the NRA, while the majority were positive to HCI. Examples include the following: referring to James Brady and his \"indefatigable wife, Sara\" who \"are both effective, courteous, proponents of gun control\" \"bravely lobbying\" with \"power and wit;\" while referring to former NRA President Bob Corbin as \"a fascist at heart\" and current NRA executive VP Wayne LaPierre as \"squinting, sweaty session, husk of his old self\" and gun owners in general as \"the gunny's dream about subduing endless enemies was like a pornographic illusion....Asking a gunny to go back to a less sophisticated firearm was like asking a devotee of pornography to go from videos back to still photographs....\"\n \n Derisive Headlines\n \n Derisive headlines were another facet of biased media covered uncovered by Mr. Patrick. Articles discussing the NRA used joking or derisive headlines 26.8 percent of the time, while HCI's articles included joking or derisive headlines 13.5 percent of the time. Even more to the point, the study found that the joking or derisive headlines used in HCI articles were aimed not at HCI, but at the NRA. For example, an article covering HCI's lobbying activities in a positive light headlined \"Faltering NRA Finds Itself Under the Gun.\" Other examples of negative, joking headlines directed at the NRA include: \"The guns of Testosterone.\" \"Aiding and Abetting a Bad Aim.\" \"Shootout at the AK Chorale.\" \n \n The other three groups in the study, the ACLU, the NAACP, and the AARP all suffered as the negative target of joking or derisive headlines, although not nearly so often as the NRA. There was not one single instance where HCI found itself the negative target of a joking or derisive headline.\n \n Satire/mockery themes \n \n The NRA also fared badly as a target of media satire-mockery themes. Examples of mocking the NRA were: \"National Redneck Association.\" \"Heston and Co. Rattlesnake in a Closet.\" \"Screw Loose.\" \"Charlton Holster.\" \"Crazed law-abiding gun owners.\" \"The hearings had a bad odor about them...and it's clear that the NRA is the skunk.\"\n Interestingly, Mr. Patrick found that the ACLU was very near the NRA in the frequency of being thus lampooned by the media. The NAACP and the AARP were also both occasionally lampooned, but not nearly so often. The study found that there was not one single instance of satire or mockery being directed at HCI or its policies.\n \n Verbs of attribution\n \n There was also a subtle bias discovered in the use of \"verbs of attribution\" (verbs used when quoting spokesmen). The study fond that reporters most often introduced or explained the NRA spokesman's position/quote with negative verbs of attribution, like \"alleged\", \"claimed\", \"asserted\", \"shrilly claimed\", \"bleated\", \"would like us to believe\", \"in a statement disputed by gun control advocates\", etc. \n \n HCI spokesmen were more often cited with neutral to positive verbs of attribution like \"says\", \"pointed out\", \"demonstrated\", \"observed\", \"argues sensibly\", \"noted\", \"speaks out\", \"testifying\", etc. \n These verbs appear to me to demonstrate which positions the reporter wants the reader to accept as truth and which ones he wants to ensure you believe are unfounded or disputed. \n \n Use of democracy themes\n \n The study found that the NRA also suffered badly in the area of media reporting using democracy themes. Of the five groups in the study, the NRA was the only one which suffered an overall negative score for its positions being represented as consistent with democracy. HCI scored the highest once again in this area. That is, its positions were described as being consistent with democracy more often than any other group. \n Examples of the NRA being described as anti-democratic by reporters are: \"National Rifle Association may feel that it has to continue to veto democracy.\" \"NRA is the Rasputin of American Politics.\" \"He must kiss the ring of the NRA.\" \"Manchurian candidates the NRA ran last election.\" \n The ACLU was found to be occasionally the subject of anti-democratic themes, particularly where its absolutist positions on constitutional rights ran afoul of public opinion. \n \n For HCI, democratic themes mentioning that organization were often put in positive terms, like \"groundswell of popular opinion.\" \n I personally find this ironic when we compare the two organizations themselves and how well they make use of democracy in selecting the group's leadership.\n \n Negative/positive descriptions of group intensity\n \n The NRA also suffered in the area of coverage of group intensity. For example, a negative phrase for intensity could be \"obsessed with,\" while a reporter who wanted to paint intensity in a positive light could use the phrase \"committed to.\" The study found that when the intensity of a viewpoint of the organization is discussed, the NRA is consistently described as having a negative intensity. \n \n Examples include: \"An old extremist message.\" \"Pavlovian opposition of the National Rifle Association.\" \"Radical NRA tactics Backfire.\" \"Assault weapon extremists.\" \"Fanatical Perch.\" \"Irrationality and extremism.\" \"Gun zealots.\" When scored on a positive/negative mean table, only the NRA received a negative score for descriptions of group intensity.\n In contrast, HCI coverage used positive intensity themes like: \"Dedicated.\" \"A personal cause.\" \"Characteristic zeal and vitality.\" \n As Mr. Patrick notes in his book: \"On the whole in elite news coverage HCI organizational actors have zeal while NRA actors are merely zealots.\" \n \n Membership trend reporting\n \n In membership reporting, Mr. Patrick again found bias against NRA. Of the five groups studied, the NRA ranked the lowest while HCI ranked the highest in terms of positive reporting of membership numbers/trends. In particular, Mr. Patrick found a \"growth dwindle\" theme in reporting NRA membership numbers. \n \n Examples include: \"NRA must decide whether to refocus its aim as its membership shrinks to smaller caliber.\" \"NRA no longer seen as invulnerable...we're beating them back.\" \"Steep decline in membership.\" \"Death spiral.\" (of the NRA organization) \"Like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.\" \n I find it ironic that these journalistic opinions are repeatedly asserted during a period in which the actual NRA membership swelled to record numbers, and at a time when there were more NRA life members than the total membership of HCI.\n \n Group labeling\n \n Finally, I wanted to mention the bias Mr. Patrick found in how the interest groups were labeled by the media. When reporters want to use a positive label, they use words like \"citizen's group.\" When they want to convey a negative image, they use words like \"special interest group.\" Mr. Patrick found that for all of the NRA articles studied, 28.8 percent labeled the NRA in a negative tone like \"lobby\" or \"special interest group.\" The other four groups combined suffered such negative labels only 5.5 percent of the time.\n Examples of negative labeling of the NRA were: \"Semi-automatic caucus.\" \"Radical gun lobby.\" \"Arrogant lobby.\" \"The gun lobby consisting of everything from neo-nazis to nature loving hunters.\" \"Evil Empire.\" \"Intimidating lobby of weapons peddlers.\" \"The NRA, a rich and paranoid lobby.\" \"A fanatical organization that is awash in the blood of homicide and suicide victims.\"\n \n This contrasts well with the common labeling of HCI as: \"Citizen's lobby.\" \"Advocates.\" \"Movement.\" \"Non-profit organization.\" \"Public interest group.\" \"Citizen's group based in Washington.\" \"Citizen members of Handgun Control, Inc.\"\n \n Having re-read this book, I think I have a better understanding of how some gun control proponents have come to believe that we gun owners are \"evil gun nuts.\" \n \n Comments?\n \n ---\n \n \"Again, I learned a lot; especially that the rank and file are usually much more primitive than we imagine. Propaganda must therefore always be essentially simple and repetitious. In the long run only he will achieve basic results in influencing public opinion who is able to reduce problems to the simplest terms and who has the courage to keep forever repeating them in this simplified form despite the objections of the intellectuals.\" Paul Joseph Goebbels, The Goebbels Diaries, 1942-1943, edited and translated by Louis P. Lochner, Doubleday & Co, Inc. New York, 1948, at Page 56 (from a private diary entry dated January 29, 1942).",

It's my opinion that the news media in this country, especially network, sold out long ago to political and corporate interests. It is becoming harder and harder to turn on the television and get anything but spin. (and yes, aside from Fox, the majority of it spins to the left just like the toilets in S. America, which by strange coincidence is where the majority of network news belongs...in the toilet).",
