   "[I came up with this a while ago on the old forum (here, incidentally - I've copied/paraphrased myself a fair bit in this post), but I thought I'd formalise my argument and post it up here to see what y'all think. Apologies for the large post size. All work here is my own, unless obviously (I hope) quoted. I don't know how well this will be received, but I found it fairly interesting because it justifies both scientific reasoning and literal biblism, without resorting to an illogical God, which is always intellectually unsatisfying. it is, however, just a piece of intellectual rambling (although if I have a surreal view of it being accepted as canonical, which would amuse me no end). I welcome your comments/critiques]\n \n There are several awkward questions which you can ask creationists. Two of these questions are 'why is the earth precisely 6000 years old' and 'how do you respond to evidence that the earth must be older than 6000 years old'?\n \n Ask any creationist why they believe that the earth is 6000 years old and they will reply with a list of perceived 'problems' with evolution and carbon dating. 'Given that this is false,' they will say, 'Creationism must be true'. Regardless of the fact that most, if not all, of the perceived flaws are not flaws at all (see Talkorigins: Responses to Creationist Claims) and that any genuine flaws do not point to Creationism (see The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster), these 'maximum ages' cited do not point to 6000 years - merely that the earth 'must' be younger than science tells us. Indeed, both Kent Hovind and Answers in Genesis state that the 'age of the earth cannot be scientifically proven' and that 'given that the bible gives proof for a young earth, you should need no more evidence' (paraphrased from each of the two links). What you can take away from this is this: The only evidence for a specifically 6000-year-old-earth is in the bible.\n \n Suppose you then follow up your question with another - 'How do you [Mr. Creationist] respond to evidence that the earth must be older than 6000 years?' By this, I mean incontrovertible (by science) dating methods that put the age of the earth at far older than 6000 years. A couple of examples would be isochron dating of zircon crystals and light from stars over 6000 light-years away (both of which I can go into further detail on, if you want). The common response is here - \"My answer is that God created the world with age... for example, He makes a rock and sets it's [apparent] age at 3 million years old.\" To quote myself arguing from a creationist perspective - \"God set up the initial conditions of the world so that the world would already be prefect. He didn't create Adam as a baby; why should he create rocks that are newly-formed? The isochron method is flawed because it is based on the fact that it is practically impossible for a rock to start off with the precise initial conditions to make it appear older than it is, but to God, all things are possible\".\n \n From these responses, we arrive at Omphalos. Omphalos is the view that \"in order for the world to be 'functional', God must have created the Earth with mountains and canyons, trees with growth rings, Adam and Eve with hair ... and that therefore no evidence that we can see of the presumed age of the earth and universe can be taken as reliable.\" Omphalos is the ultimate answer to any scientific criticism of Creationism, in that it renders all scientific theorising pointless. It does, however, have some interesting logical consequences, as I will now go on to state.\n \n 'Last Thursdayism'\n From my first question, we can see that the only evidence for a 6000-year-old earth is in the Bible. Therefore (hypothetically and in extremis), were the bible to state that the earth was created, for example, yesterday, then this would be equally true and justifiable by faith in the Bible. Any memories we would have of a time before yesterday would be false memories created by God, last weeks newspaper equally so. After all (argues Omphalos), any scientific dating methods (empirical analysis of the universe) are untrue. Finding last Christmas' advent calendar (again, empirically analysing the universe) would be just as irrelevant to the 'actual truth'.\n \n 'False reality'\n This is not a consequence, more it is the logical dilemma presented by Omphalos to the Christian faith. The dilemma is this: God cannot lie. Omphalos, however, states that God has created 'false' pasts - false memories for people were the bible to say the universe was created yesterday, but a false reality for 6000 years ago that allows light from distant stars to have reached us, and allows rocks to have precisely the correct amount of isotopes in them to allow for isochronic dating to give scientifically valid 'old' results. These 'false' pasts are, essentially, God setting things up so that things appear different to how they actually are - they are lies. How can it be that a God who cannot lie can simultaneously lie to us through the medium of... everything?\n \n Solving the dilemma.\n The only way to resolve this problem without breaking logic is for God to reify (make real) the 'false' pasts. So the earth is old. God created it 6000 years ago, but He gave everything 'false' pasts - for example, light getting to us from the North Star (430 light years away) had a 'false' past stretching back 430 years, so the light hit the Earth at the moment of Creation. Because God cannot lie, those 'false' pasts are real. Every piece of scientific data that we can gather is equally real, because if it was not, God would be lying to us. We really are in a 4.5-billion-year-old-universe, just one that was created 6000 years ago. Evolution really did occur, and still occurs today, it's just that it wasn't mentioned in the Bible because there wasn't much point - God had just created the entire history of the earth stretching back billions of years from day zero, 6 millennia ago, and not a lot of evolution went on in those 6000 years. While this sounds fantastical, remember that we are dealing here with a deity of omnipotent power.\n \n It would be possible to reject this consequence with the claim that God is not avoiding lying to us, we are merely misinterpreting our evidence. But there is such a wealth of evidence all pointing to an old earth, and none pointing to a Young (again, see the Talkorigins page from earlier), that it would have to be a work of God for earth to be other than that which we interpret it as. It just takes another - equally literal - interpretation of Genesis. This view of creation appeals to me because it allows both scientific reasoning and a literal version of Genesis - as such, it removes some of the controversy. True, it 'reduces' the view of a Young Earth to purely faith-based, but this was pretty much always the case from the outset, otherwise there would be more satisfying responses to my first two questions. if you have them, feel free to provide them.\n \n I welcome your responses.",

   "Interesting. It certainly presents an alternative hoop for faith to jump through.\n \n Beyond that, however, I don't think it really works. If god reified the past, it makes no sense to talk about the world having been created 6000 years ago - that would imply that if one went back 6000 of our years you would see god at work, which according to your own premise you wouldn't.\n \n If this world were created by a god who exists outside time, it didn't happen any 'years' ago. There was never a 'human-when' in which the universe didn't exist, there is only a 'god-when'.\n \n You could say instead that god created the universe, end to end and start to finish, drew our timeline out from one point to another X years apart, and that we are at present 6000 years distant from one end of that line. But that wouldn't make 6000 years ago the moment of creation, because there is no moment of creation within our timeline, only within god's timeline. No god-time passes with the passing of our years; we are a static 4D sculpture as far as he is concerned. No matter which way you look at it, the earth is not 6000 years old, any more than you could claim America is 2 inches coast-to-coast by starting your measurements 2 inches from the sea and saying the rest 'doesn't count'.",

   "How does that help? Surely it just raises the question why?\n\n Ineffability? I'm not saying it 'helps' in the overarching better-knowing-Gods-mind-theology, but it would help in that it (potentially) pleases both sides in the Creation vs Science debate. Scientifically, the earth is ancient. Theologically (if you so choose to believe), the Bible story starts 6000 years ago. It removes conflict, puts YEC firmly back in the 'faith' category, and removes criticism of science/evolution on theistic grounds.\n \n \nIt still doesn't make sense to say that 6000 years ago was when it happened.

The point we're both making here is that because (in the theory) time was created 'from the outside', as it were, then it is silly to set down the specific 'time' at which God decided to make it. I'm taking this a step further by saying this means that God didn't necessarily make the universe 'from the start', but could have instead made it at any date - see Last Thursdayism and the original Omphalos. If you don't want to say the specific 'universe' was created 6000 years ago because of semantic difficulties over the creation of time, you can at least say that Adam and Eve were created 6000 years ago by God breathing life into dust. As soon as they were there, however, they had histories, parents, and a whole evolutionary chain stretching back millions of years. It's something of a Pratchett viewpoint (see quote, below - paraphrased because I can't quite remember it).\n \n \nThere was a grinding noise, and a shop appeared on the side of the road.

By setting our universe of time and space within a greater meta-reality to be poked and prodded by god you've redefined what it means for a history to be real. The real history of the universe is that which god remembers, in the same way a sculptor remembers the block of stone and the series of chisel-strokes the finished sculpture has forgotten. If he breathes life into Adam and Eve, and then chisels out a history for them and the earth itself to remember, he is still deceiving them; the history is still false, it is still not how they came to be.

'God's reality' is different from 'our reality', but I would assume this to be the case regardless of my theory - we are dealing with an omnipotent being who exists outside of time (cf: the Problem of Evil vs Free Will vs omniscience regarding the future). \n \n A possibly superior alternative of my entire first post is to say the following. It's slightly changed from the first post to include your critique (less reification and more acknowledgement of the meta) - huzzah for adaptation! emoticon_cool \n \n Problem:\n A) Empirical data on it's own implies valid ages of <6000 years. \n B) The bible on it's own implies an age of = 6000\n C) The bible and the data conflict.\n \n Solution to C:\n 1) Re-write A: The data/interpretation is wrong\n 2) Re-write B: The Bible/interpretation is wrong\n 3) Re-write A&B: The bible when combined with this data implies that any data from <6000 years is from a meta-reality, created by God. \n \n Consequences of 3: \n If you choose to accept the Bible then the 'older' dates (and by inference evolution) are valid, they are just from the meta-reality. This is not the 'absolute truth' of 6000 years as seen by God, but God's mind is unknowable and incomprehendable (also laid out in the Bible), so this should not come as too much of a shock. Just because it's from a meta-reality does not mean that it isn't relevant, as when we observe the meta-reality (by looking at distant stars, amongst other things), today's science still applies.\n \n The argument now turns from 'my religion disproves your science' to 'my religion changes your view of your science, but renders it no less valid'. This is the same argument that runs wherever God is introduced.\n \n EDIT: Hmmm, I still think it could be worded better. I hope this sums it up, though. Science is valid because the meta-reality matches our current reality. The Bible is valid because it implies that the meta-reality exists.

They are just useful models which work well for us. By the same token, I'm not concerned about whether last thursday was a false memory or whether God created everything 6,000 years ago with a prior history. Science is not a discipline in theology and it doesn't have to address things like Omphalos. When I read that the evidence points to theropod ancestors to birds during the Jurassic period, the evidence stands on its own whether or not that phylogenetic history was planted there by God.

They live specifically in inter-tidal habitats, and have evolved air-breathing as a mechanism for coping with the constant advance and retreat of the water (similar in a broad sense to a frog I suppose). \n \n Info here...\n \n P.S. I found the Snakehead . It's a member of the Perch family and is recorded as a pest in NA. It doesn't appear to be well adapted to cross large areas of land, the US should be safe.\n \n \nSo how is that evidence of evolution at all? It breathes air, walks on land and still survives and thrives in the water in the modern world. \n\n \n FFS....\n \n I'd call this a strawman, but I don't think you understand why you're wrong. Doesn't the fact that this is clearly a fish, yet it can breathe out of water and moves around extensively on land tell you it's done something a bit different? Do you know about the lungfish (Dipnoi)? They actually have lungs, breathe air and can bury themselves in a lake bed to survive drought. Other fish can't do this... The point is we can compare them to closely related aquatic gobies and trace the evolutionary path. These 'skippers breath through gills kept moist by mucus. They don't actually breathe air directly (in the same way that we do). They 'walk' on their pectoral fins (which clearly are fins, and are common in all fish). They have exapted thier bodies systems to exist in a new environment. In fact you'd have been hard pressed to find a species that better showed how evolution works through modification of existing characters...\n \n You seem to think that these gobies are the actual Devonian transients (like Eryops and so on). I don't know how far back the Mudskippers go, indeed the I can access from home is limited, but the gobies don't go back that far....\n \n \nExactly what evolved from it again? \n\n \n Without a quick trip in the TARDIS (is it possible to have a slow trip in a time machine?), it's impossible to tell what will evolve from this particular population.

   "But doesn't the walking fish still exist? <snip<\n So how is that evidence of evolution at all? It breathes air, walks on land and still survives and thrives in the water in the modern world. Exactly what evolved from it again?\n\n Before we tackle that specific example, you need to take a step back and re-examine what you think goes on according to evolution. We went through the same process with chimps and humans in our discussion a while ago, but you don't seem to be extrapolating the concepts explained there to a general principle.\n \n There's no requirement for the whole of a species to evolve in the same 'direction'. Indeed, it's almost impossible unless the whole species interbreeds robustly, maintaining an even distribution of traits as they evolve. Very often as populations expand or migrate into new areas they become segregated, lose genetic 'touch' with their distant relatives and pow: you've got incipient speciation. You can see this happening right now, today, in various ring species.\n \n That's how creatures like the walking fish arose in the first place. At one point there were only early fish, and as they bred and expanded their range some of them ended up living in or near shallow, tidal waters - a niche to which they were reasonably well suited, but where there was substantial room for improvement and untapped resources for which there was no competition.\n \n Assuming for the sake of argument these creatures can be traced all the way back to the first such forms, we could still see them as well as other land creatures who evolved from the same ancestors for the same simple reason we see them as well as fish: the old niche remains a valid place /way to live and thrive, side by side with the newly exploited niche.\n \n Ask yourself: how and why would any species evolve entirely out of a viable ecological niche? Because that's what you're implying should happen, when you ask why there are still chimps or walking fish around. The fact that one niche might be a more attractive prospect to us as observers - perhaps we conceitedly perceive it as being a step closer to us - is irrelevant when considering whether the niche will reward with survival and reproduction those organisms best adapted to it.\n \n Tradition has it that at this stage you will say this is nothing but a theory and I have no proof that's what actually happened, forgetting that the whole point of the above is to correct your misapprehensions regarding evolutionary theory itself. So yes, of course it's a theory: the actual theory (or part of it, anyway). We can get to the evidence supporting it later; right now I really just want you to get your head around the theory.",
