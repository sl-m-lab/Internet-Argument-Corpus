   "I thought it would be nice to start a thread where people can express their views on the issue of abortion in a more detailed way than they might when responding in a debate.\n \n I'll start (and let's keep it nice kids, no fighting in the playground ).\n \n A lot of my views changed when I became a Christian, and even my view on abortion changed somewhat.\n \n I'll say straight out that I am Pro-Choice.\n \n Now, here are my reasonings, etc.\n \n I know that foetuses are humans. What they AREN'T is human BEINGS until around the end of the second trimester. See, I view human beings as people who have souls. I personally think the soul is intricately connected with mental existence, and that the soul only comes into play when we are mentally existant and vice versa.\n \n I personally would draw the line for most abortions at around 20 weeks when I think the soul enters the body. However, I think that abortions after that should be allowed if the mother's health is in danger.\n \n People should have the choice of whether or not they have a child - they should not be forced due to stupid mistakes, birth control that happened to not work, or a sick evil man who raped them, or a father or uncle that violated them.\n \n I personally had an abortion. I've spoken of it in the past on here - my husband (then boyfriend) and I both used protection (condom and the pill), but they failed. We had money problems and we were both trying to get through college at the time. Had I continued the pregnancy we wouldn't have been able to even feed ourselves, let alone afford the costs AFTER the baby was born (contrary to popular pro-life opinion, pregnancy itself is VERY expensive, and then there is the cost of the hospital FOR the birth). From what my doctor said, I would also have been unable to work after my fifth month (physical exertion is part of my job), which would make the situation even worse, with me not bringing in four months worth of money.\n \n ~\n ~\n ~\n ~\n ~\n ~\n Now, I also have seen several Bible verses whish somewhat support my views (or even go further than that), as they illustrate numerous instances in which the death of a foetus does not seem to be \"murder\" or anything else that the pro-lifers claim, in fact numerous times which God has hHmself either caused or ordered abortions.\n \n Here are a few (note the ones about the under one month of age - much much further than the limit I would like to see):\n \n  --Abortion is not murder. A fetus is not considered a human life. \n \n If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life.  -- Exodus 21:22-23 \n \n \n  --The Bible places no value on fetuses or infants less than one month old. \n \n And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. -- Leviticus 27:6 \n \n \n  --Fetuses and infants less than one month old are not considered persons. \n \n Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them. And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD. -- Numbers 3:15-16 \n \n \n  --God sometimes approves of killing fetuses. \n \n And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? ... Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. -- Numbers 31:15-17 \n \n Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. -- Hosea 9:14 \n \n Yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb. -- Hosea 9:16 \n \n Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up. -- Hosea 13:16 \n \n \n  --God sometimes kills newborn babies to punish their parents. \n \n Because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die. -- 2 Samuel 12:14 \n \n \n  --God sometimes causes abortions by cursing unfaithful wives. \n \n The priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell. And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen. ... \n \n And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people. And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed. -- Numbers 5:21-21, 27-28 \n \n \n  --God's law sometimes requires the execution (by burning to death) of pregnant women. \n \n Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. -- Genesis 38:24\n \n \n So. Discuss and give your views.",

However, I think a woman should have that choice. I think that heroic efforts should be made to prevent pregnancy when it is unwanted but ultimately it is up to the person who'd have to have the child. On a selfish note, there are already too many people here and I'd love to see the birth rate decrease. But don't guild the Lilly, when you abort a baby, you abort a baby.

   "Pro-choice.\n \n I think abortion is awful and I would like to see it reduced to the bare minimum. I don't beleive that can be acheived through its criminalization. Half the world's abortion's are illegal. That is a pretty strong indicator that criminalization is ineffective. Criminalization also ties the hands and second guesses doctors and reduces the liberty of women. \n \n Evidence also shows that abortion goes down with access to birth control, medical care and programs that help women and children. I believe reducing abortion is best acheived through education and meeting the needs of pregnant women. I would also encourage more open adoptions. \n \n I also believe we need to change how we raise girls. Having a man is still considered the measure of success for women. Magazines at females from the tween years on up all have headlines about how to attract and keep a guy. Now, there is nothing wrong with being in a good relationship - but we need to encourage a more balanced view. Women are stigmatized for being single and that needs to stop. As long as a woman's worth is tied to having a man there will be more unplanned pregnancies and abortion.\n \n I also think the debate needs to grow up. The woman-hater vs. selfish baby-killer rants serve nothing.",

   "Pro-Choice to the extent that I have no interest in changing the law. I would rather change your mind.\n \n Pro-Life to the point that I believe abortion results in the destruction of human life. The question of when life begins is nonsensical. Life doesn't begin anywhere, it continues. Both the egg and sperm are living cells and part of the individual containing them. They have the same DNA coding of the individual and are part of their body. When an egg and sperm combine, a separate and unique individual is formed, with separate and unique DNA coding, unique enough to identify them in a court of law. The coding itself contains more than just physical characteristics. In studies of identical twins separated at birth, some researchers have conclude that personality traits may have a genetic bias, where our behaviors are a mixture between environment and genetic predisposition.\n \n As someone with a pro-life stance, I also believe there is a responsibility part of the equation. A Catholic Church in Alabama offers to pay for the pre-natal care, birth cost, and finding a home. I think more attention need to go towards education, child rearing options, and support for those who chose to believe with us.",

You state that banning all abortion is the 'safest' way - but this is only true if you completely ignore the point of view of the pregnant woman - to her, the 'safest' way is to be allowed to abort at any point, as she knows more and more about the foetus.

   "I thought it would be nice to start a thread where people can express their views on the issue of abortion in a more detailed way than they might when responding in a debate.\n\n Following the original purpose of this thread, I will summarize my own views on abortion. (Note, this is copied from an older survey on abortion beliefs - a thread in the abortion forum called \"Survey of views on abortion\"):\n \n For me, the question of abortion rights comes down to a balance between the rights of the mother and the rights of the fetus. On the side of the rights of the mother, there is a very important right to the control over one's own body and to not be forced to carry something as important and taxing as a pregnancy against one's will. Some may say that, in agreeing to have sex, a woman is agreeing to a pregnancy, but I strongly disagree. A pregnancy is a possible outcome of sex but only has a very small percentage chance if birth control is used. It would be like saying that you agree to be mugged if you walk in a bad neighborhood. The great majority of sex acts - for both married and unmarried women, religious or non-religious, conservative or liberal - are not done for the purposes of having children but are done for emotional and/or purely physical reasons. Pregnancy is the goal for only a minority of sex acts. So, women are not agreeing to a pregnancy when they have sex. In the case of unwanted pregnancies, it is a significant burden that they never agreed to. If they are forced to carry such a pregnancy, it would be a strong imposition against the rights over their own bodies.\n \n On the other hand, one has the rights of the fetus. What rights the fetus has depends on your belief system and priorities. For me, the most important thing when it comes to the rights of any human being is whether or not there is a mental existence - at least a rudimentary mind. I believe that I did not exist until I started to mentally exist and that applies to all others. My view is that, once a mental existence begins, the right to life of a fetus kicks in and takes priority over the mother's rights over her own body, under most circumstances. The neurological view is that a mind cannot exist before the third trimester. Therefore, I would allow abortion-on-demand for the first and second trimester and restrict it in the third trimester. For that third trimester, I would limit abortions to those that are done to mitigate a significant risk to the mother's life or physical or mental health (ex. leading to, say, paralysis or strong possibility of suicide, etc.) and, in case of severe incurable deformations of the fetus discovered late, to end the life of a fetus that would otherwise strongly suffer (i.e. mercy killing). Otherwise, I believe abortions should be restricted. If a woman has not decided on an abortion by the third trimester, she should have to carry the pregnancy to term (minus the perviously mentioned exceptions). She would have had ample time to decide.\n \n Lastly, here are a couple of links which describe the neurological view of a mind not existing before the third trimester:\n \n Part 4 of http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml \n \n http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=21&id=162",

   "The pleasures all mine... really!\n \n Let me tell you what you're going to do, over the next few months you'll post the same old worn out rhetoric that every other anti-choicer has for the last several decades. You won't be able to back anything up with viable scientifically proven facts. You'll use words that the anti-choice movement has made up out of thin air, and you'll use your own \"unique' definitions for words that most 3rd graders know the real definition for. See...? I just save us several months of frustration. You're welcome emoticon_xgood\n \n \n emoticon_xbye\n\n \n Heee's Baa'aak; spouting the same old drivel and accusing the defenders of human life of exactly what the pro-death advocates do themselves. At least you're consistent in your tired old justifications for condoning genocidal infanticide which has infected our culture to the tune of 1.3 million victims a year. emoticon_xdonno",

   "Pro-choice.\n \n I think abortion is awful and I would like to see it reduced to the bare minimum.\n\n \n Hi jitobear. I am also pro-choice. This comment jumped out at me, though. Do you think it's seen as awful do to cultural conditioning? Could this have it wrong? There is no scientific basis that it's a human person, at the stage of development when the vast majority of abortions occur. I worry that by suggesting it's so negative, it can't help but be a stigma on the woman who chooses to abort her pregnancy. No woman should feel the need to apologize in relation to abortion, which is just about control over one's own body.",
