And white racism is the only racism problem this country has. You think Rev. Wright's ideas came from nowhere? They're reactionary.\n\n \n When I lived in the South back in the 80s, I visited churches before picking one. After all, I wanted to know what they represented before joining. And I visited a couple of churches who not only had no black members but were avowedly anti-black/racist. I not only grabbed my family and walked out of those churches when I realized what they stood for, but I did it in the middle of the pastors sermon as he was speaking the words, and I wasn't quiet about it. In one church I said loudly to my wife, Get up! we're leaving because this guy doesn't know the Lord at all, he's nothing but an ignorant racist. I said you people have fun worshiping your doctrine of superiority and hate, I'm seeking a body of believers who want to worship my God of love. \n \n So you may think that Obama isn't responsible for what Wright believes, but he is responsible for remaining in a hate based church like that for 20 years. You see, it reflects on his moral and spiritual value system. Evidently that is something you're unaware of. We are who we associate with.",
