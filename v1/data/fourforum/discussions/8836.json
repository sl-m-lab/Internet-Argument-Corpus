Every time a senator brings a bill to the floor because he believes it is right, out of his moral/religious views, religion is being used to determine public policy. People who are religious have every right to participate in the political process according to their morals as well as anyone else. \n \n A better way to say it is to say that religion ALONE shouldn't be used to determine public policy, but even then, there's nothing to stop religion from being the sole reason if that's what happens. What if a congressperson or president wants a bill guaranteeing the right to gay marriage because his religious beliefs tell him it's the right thing to do??? Are you still going to hold to the idea that religion can't determine public policy and tell him \"nope, we can't have that bill because it's out of religious beliefs.\"?\n\n \n What they are saying is yes...if a Senator votes for a bill and says \"I did it because it was the right thing to do\" than what is \"right\" is a belief (right and wrong can't be proven by any \"science\") so this would be unacceptable.

There is a difference between right and wrong and religious beliefs.\n\n \n In the sense I am talking about...pretty much. A religion is normally thought of as a set of beliefs derived from a power higher than you. So if you have a set of beliefs (ie right and wrong) then you can get derive them from 1) what you believe to be a power higher than you...this can include a God, nature, a rock, a collective group of people, etc...or 2)from yourself.

If a law has to have a \"secular\" purpose (which it doesn't in the US) than if 51 people voted on it for a non-secular reason than it is unconstitutional. It is either that or you think the voting is ok but if someone challeneges it the court has to decide if they can think of a non-secular reason.

You just refuse to read the documents from which the 1st amendment was derived. The lst amendment was made to protect religion from the government more than the other way around. Back when people were getting jailed for not paying their dues to the Bapitist church someone came up with the idea that you shouldn't be able to do this. Va and Mass. both created \"declaration of rights\" which addressed the issue and these were the basis for the 1st amendment you see today. \n \n \nMeaningless point.\n The 14th amendment clearly revokes any miscegenation law, but it was a full ONE HUNDRED YEARS AFTER the 14th amendment was ratified that it finally was used to strike all miscegenation laws from the books.\n Just because an unconstitutionality was allowed to exist for decades, or even a century, doesn't justify the unconstitutionality.\n It was a full 60-70 years before any judge thought 1) the Bill of Rights applied to the states 2) before a 1st amendment religion case (big one) came before the supreme court and 3) before \"substantive due process\" got going big. The point isn't meaningless because it shows that no one thought that way until well after the fact leading to believe that the words \"changed\" over time as opposed to taking the meaning of the adopters.\n \n \nIf you look at the history of the 1st amendment, you'll see that the debate has existed THROUGHOUT the life-time of the first amendment.\n Do you have ANY case law which backs up your claim?\n I don't need case law. I have actual laws to back up my claim. The \"debate\" hasn't existed throughout the life time of the 1st amendment. The amendment had a meaning when it was adopted. Was there debate when getting it passed? Sure, but the main debate BY CHURCHES was that the constitution didn't say that a government couldn't choose one church over the next. This was, like i said earlier, because some governments ESTABLISHED (get that) a religion and taxed people for the church and put them in jail if they didn't go. This combined with the language of the Va declaration of rights and the fact that many documents mentioned a \"God\" or clearly had laws that were not of a 'secular' reason shows that no one thought the 1st amendment means what you believe it to mean today. This is a simple \"orginalist\" approach and even your judges today will admit that they believe the language has evolved into a different meaning today to fit our times.\n \n If you challenge me to a \"case law\" find than I will ask you to provide \"case law\" established prior to 1875 regarding the 1st amendment (freedom of religion).",

(And I'd argue it's a good example if how the Christian religion is in fact a very reasonable thing, also pointed out in The Reasonableness of Christianity, by John Locke). So again, policy cannot be made based on religion ALONE. Let me ask you, do you think laws forcing business owners to close on Sundays (and therefore depriving them of business) are good to have?

You think that is a legitimate \"reason\"?\n The 14th amendment requires a legitimate state interest exist FOR discrimination to exist.\n The requirement is not that a good reason be shown for the discrimination to stop.\n The 14th amendment IS the reason for the discrimination to stop...\n \n 2) Nobody is talking about \"opening it up to whatever comes along\".\n Let's just stop passing that lame hyperbole / straw-man argument around, shall we?\n\n \n It depends, of course, on whether or not that discrimination is really taking place. I'm constantly amazed at how people have such a wide-open anything-applies approach to that amendment; it's become to some people like a constitution in and of itself. With the way some people think of the 14th, the rest of the constitution is hardly even necessary! With your wide-open standard of logic, everyone on my street could get together and start lobbying saying they are being discriminated against because the govt. won't let the whole group be considered married. After all, the 14th says they can't be discriminated against! You say no one is talking about opening up marriage, but by redefining it you certainly ARE opening it up because you'd be setting a legal precedent. That's why I think marriage should remain as a criteria for men and women who marry each other to get couples' benefits, and gay couples or whatever other arrangements are out there should get them under different criteria. That way marriage doesn't have to be redefined and the 14th isn't violated. \n \n \nAnd those reasons can be given. You may balk at being asked for those reasons, but those reasons exists and the fact that those reasons ARE REQUIRED does exist.\n\n \n And for that reason I have no problem with gay people getting the same sort of couples' benefits--but I don't think marriage should be redefined to do so.\n \n \nAnd for the record, \"giving single people marriage benefits\"???\n Name me ANY \"marriage benefit\" which would make sense for a single person to have...\n \n Can a single person be given a right to not have to testify against his spouse? (himself). Already done in the 5th amendment.\n Can a single person have the right to visit themselves in the hospital?\n Can a single person have the right to inheritance upon his own death?\n Can a single person have the right to share medical and insurance benefits with... himself?\n\n \n Yes, in every one of those cases, a single person could be given such a right (as it applies to someone else they want it to), if they are co-habitating with someone and don't want to get married. What makes you think everyone wants to tie the knot?",

And considering how often that difference has been pointed out to you, one can only be left with a conclusion that you are purposely trying to deceitfully misrepresent...\n \n \n \nYou say no one is talking about opening up marriage, but by redefining it you certainly ARE opening it up because you'd be setting a legal precedent.

That way marriage doesn't have to be redefined and the 14th isn't violated. \n\n We've talked about this before.\n The precedent ALREADY EXISTS. Loving v Virginia.\n \n Our nation's rich history in \"defining\" marriage as including racial requirements exists. It is a modern re-definition of marriage to claim that those racial requirements aren't there.\n But now, in 2006, people are suddenly blind to the fact that just a couple decades ago a majority in this country defined \"marriage\" as including racial requirements.\n \n Moreover, YOU do not want to go through and examine if the discrimination is present or unjustified, but that isn't a defense against the 14th amendment.\n The 14th amendment is very powerful in what it says and requires. It's living up to an American ideal of equality.\n If you cower from that ideal, then you are stripping America of something that makes it great.\n \n \n \nAnd for that reason I have no problem with gay people getting the same sort of couples' benefits--but I don't think marriage should be redefined to do so.\n\n That's an opinion on a conclusion.\n It's not a statement on the actual mechanisms of the amendment, and what it means.\n \n Your statement is not a constitutional argument, but rather a preference...\n \n \n \nYes, in every one of those cases, a single person could be given such a right (as it applies to someone else they want it to), if they are co-habitating with someone and don't want to get married. What makes you think everyone wants to tie the knot?\n\n \"if they are co-habitating with someone and don't want to get married\"???\n It wouldn't be a \"single\" person who would be getting the benefits then, would it...\n It would be an UNMARRIED COUPLE who would be getting the benefits.\n \n And your complaint is profoundly stupid.\n It's like saying that a black man shouldn't be allowed to drink from the fountain, because other white people exist who want a drink, but don't want to drink from THAT fountain.\n \n They have the OPPORTUNITY to obtain the marriage rights recognized from the government. Complaining about people who want marriage benefits without marrying is just plain pointless and inane.\n \n Unmarried straight couples have the LEGAL CAPABILITY to obtain the right.\n Gay couples DO NOT have the legal capability to obtain the right.\n Trying to compare the two is just mind-boggling, and I should be amazed that you don't automatically recognize that... :xbanghead",
