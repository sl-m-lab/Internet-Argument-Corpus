   "I've seen this term, along with the term \"religionists,\" being bandied about.\n \n Wonder what it means, precisely. Sounds like it might be an insulting term.\n \n One site posted a link to Focus on the Family to delineate what the term \"Christianist\" might be:\n \n https://www.family.org/welcome/press/a0038760.cfm\n \n \nFocus on the Family Severs Ties with Wells Fargo\n \n Following comments made on today's \"Focus on the Family\" radio broadcast regarding the organization's decision to end its banking relationship with Wells Fargo, Focus President and CEO Jim Daly issued the following statement: \n \"Focus on the Family has elected to end its banking relationship with Wells Fargo, motivated primarily by the bank's ongoing efforts to advance the radical homosexual agenda. These efforts are in direct opposition to the underlying principles and purpose of Focus, and thus a decision of conscience had to be made, and a stand taken. \n \n Earlier this year we learned that Wells Fargo gave a matching gift to a pro-homosexual group to enable it to raise more money to fight organizations like our own. As one of Wells Fargo's customers, we objected, and we received no satisfactory resolution from the bank's corporate office. \n \n The homosexual group's web page said this: \"Incredible news: Wells Fargo has offered to help support GLAAD's fight for equality against the Anti-Gay industry by matching your tax-deductible contribution dollar for dollar.\" \n \n We realize that if we dealt only with companies that reflect our Christian values we would have a hard time doing business with Corporate America. That said, when our bank allows proceeds from our business to be used to impede our work, we must object, even if it inconveniences us in our professional relationships. \n \n We at Focus on the Family respect the worth and dignity of every human being. We are not attacking the gay individual, nor are we singling out Wells Fargo employees for censure. We had the opportunity to work with many Wells Fargo staff while in relationship with the bank, and we know firsthand the good job they do. However, we feel that the aggressive agenda of the homosexual movement and its activists is harmful to families, and we believe it is time to stand up and fight that. Our decision is not personal, but principled, and we trust our constituents and others will respect it.\" . . .\n",
