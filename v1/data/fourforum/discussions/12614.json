Breaking the code breaks the nation's honor, no matter how dire the situation, no matter the results.\n \n Former Vice President Dick Cheney defends his strong support of water-boarding and other extreme measures used against detainees after Sept. 11. He demands that the positive results of the torturous acts be broadcast.\n And look what they did. They hijacked our planes, ripped down our skyscrapers, damaged our Pentagon, killed thousands. In the nightmarish months that followed, we put our Constitution to the test, bending the rules out of fear.\n \n We broke our own code when we allowed detainees to be tortured, through water-boarding, depriving them of sleep and more. When we were inhumane to others, we reduced our home humanity. We handicapped our ability to demand humane treatment of our soldiers and nationals. Any useful intelligence we received pales in comparison to the damage done.\n The trouble with a moral code is its constancy. It can't change with the tide or circumstances, nor should it.\n \n Our open government that makes security challenging still is the trademark of our democracy.

Strawman? It doesn't matter what Obama did, we are talking about something else (leave it up for some other argument.) That being said, yes we are in the wrong in this situation. We cannot claim we care about freedom when we deny certain rights to criminals and torture them. We not only violated many of our laws but international laws, some of which we helped write! If you truly care about your country and what it stands for, you should not support torture period. Regardless of how horrible the crime etc, we should leave that up to our judicial system. If found guilty and death is the punishment, so be it. That is why we have trial by jury. If the government starts bending our own Constitution as they see fit, what would stop them from taking it further. If we allow it to continue it will only get worse. We'd be no different than those nations that have authoritarian rule.",
