   "The crock here is this nonsense. Simply because a trace was performed on a gun that doesn't mean the gun was used in a crime. Gun traces are requested for any gun that's in police custody for any reason. Lost guns, stolen guns, confiscated guns, surrendered guns, etc. That's the physical nature of the beast.\n \n All of these arguments about the Tiahrt Amendment have been made before. And none of them have been proven accurate. The police have access to trace information if they need it for an official investigation. They get no more than what they have jurisdiction to investigate. The records for a place like Ohio are of no relevance to the police of Chicago or San Francisco or New York.",
