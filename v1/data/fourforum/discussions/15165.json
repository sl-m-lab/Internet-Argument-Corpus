   "Guns: Bill would make it easier for California lawmakers to carry concealed weapons - latimes.com\n \n \nThe right to carry a concealed weapon in California is mostly reserved for those at risk of violence - jewelers, bail bondsmen and criminal prosecutors among them.\n \n But some legislators say their job has become dangerous too. Despite objections from some law enforcement officials and even gun rights advocates, they want a law that would make it easier for them to tote firearms for protection.\n \n The lawmakers cite the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) in Tucson and threats from constituents in California as cause for permits to carry weapons.\n \n \"I've had guys physically come up to me ready to punch me out,\" said Democratic state Sen. Lou Correa of Santa Ana, co-author of a new permit proposal.\n \n Correa, who owns a gun but doesn't have a concealed-weapon permit, said he has received threats of violence in e-mails, some of which are filled with racial slurs. He said staffers in his Orange County district office have been spat upon, and some have felt threatened by members of the public who come into the office and scream at them because they don't like the way the state is run.\n \n After the Arizona shooting, one staffer requested that Correa provide a Taser for the office, something he is considering.\n \n Sen. Rod Wright (D-Inglewood), another gun owner and co-author of the proposal, maintains that lawmakers need permits as much as other professionals who have them. Permission should be available, he said, \"if you have people who might shoot you because of your occupation.\"\n \n Under current law, Californians who want to carry concealed firearms must apply to their county sheriff or police chief and show \"good cause\" for permission. That can include threats of violence or a dangerous job.\n \n Under the new bill, being an elected state official or a member of Congress would constitute good cause. The officials would, like others, be subject to a background check, and a sheriff or police chief could still turn down the application, Wright noted.\n \n Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca objects to singling out elected officials.\n \n \"We feel electeds should go through the same process [of showing good cause] as everyone else,\" said Lt. Wayne Bilowit, the sheriff's liaison with the Legislature.\n \n Baca has issued about 400 permits countywide, including many to judges and a few to elected officials, Bilowit said. They include county Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich and Assemblyman Tony Mendoza (D-Artesia), according to county records.\n \n The bill's prospects are unclear, even though some members of the majority party are behind it and the measure includes provisions generally supported by Republicans. One such clause involves gun-safety training required of any permit applicant: The measure would allow the training to take place after the permit decision rather than before, saving the applicant money when permission is denied.\n \n Gov. Jerry Brown has not taken a public position on the legislation.\n \n Still, it has created some rare common ground among activists for both gun rights and gun control.\n \n Karen Arntzen, coordinator of the California Chapters of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, agrees with Baca that the state should have no special status for elected officials.\n \n \"We feel there is no reason why legislators should be any different than other citizens,\" she said.\n \n Opponents of gun control note that some of the lawmakers behind SB 610, including its third author, Assemblywoman Cathleen Galgiani (D-Tracy), have opposed some efforts to make it easier for others to carry guns.\n \n Wright and Galgiani voted for legislation in 2009 that limits the ability of residents in small counties to use their gun permits in big urban areas. Wright and Correa supported a Galgiani bill last year that barred people from carrying even unloaded firearms into the state Capitol or any legislative office or hearing room.\n \n \"We do look at that as inconsistent,\" said Sam Paredes, executive director of the nonprofit Gun Owners of California. He questioned whether lawmakers are in any more danger than anyone else.\n \n \"All law-abiding citizens have the same good cause,\" he said. \"They are law-abiding citizens in troubled times.\"\n\n \n Personally I think this is a very bad idea. Legislators shouldn't be allowed an exemption to California's laws that would give them a considerable advantage over the regular people who have to live there. If everybody else has to suffer with may issue standards so should the politicians that do business there. What's good enough for the goose is good enough for the gander.",

   "EDITORIAL: Guns for us, not for you - Washington Times\n \n \nSome of the most far-out anti-gun laws are found on the left coast, but that could change - for privileged politicians. A California state Senate committee will consider a bill next week that grants legislators permission to carry concealed firearms. The measure highlights the growing rift between the bureaucratic class and taxpayers who don't have the luxury of exempting themselves from bad laws.\n \n Ordinary Californians who want a concealed carry permit need to apply to the local sheriff. In practice - outside of conservative, rural counties - only celebrities and the well-connected end up obtaining the coveted document. In a state of nearly 37 million, about 40,000 permits were issued in 2007. The proposal being offered by a pair of pro-gun state Senate Democrats would automatically define as eligible for a permit \"any applicant who is a member of Congress, a statewide elected official or a Member of the Legislature.\" These could carry a gun \"for purposes of protection or self-defense.\" Coddled lawmakers living in gated communities may think they face heightened risk, but it's unlikely poor residents in sketchy urban neighborhoods have any less of a need.\n \n California's gun laws are strict and include a ban on high-capacity magazines and scary-looking \"assault weapons\" - a statute so arbitrary that the state had to create a 96-page picture book to illustrate which items are prohibited. The latest scheme took effect last year requiring guns to imprint their serial number on every shell casing fired. This law was adopted even though such \"microstamping\"technology isn't available, and it would be extremely expensive if it were.\n \n The motivation of lawmakers in layering restriction on top of restriction hasn't been to stop bad guys. Criminals, by definition, don't abide by the law. Rather, the primary purpose is to harass gun owners who do try to do what's right. Such laws have proved irrelevant anyway. The gun grabbers predicted the 2004 expiration of the federal assault weapons ban would fill our streets with blood. The latest available FBI crime stats showed a 6.2 percent decrease in violent crimes for the first half of 2010. The number of murders without the ban is now 34 percent lower than when it took effect in 1994.\n \n Practically any bill that respects the right to keep and bear arms in a left-leaning state ought to be supported, no matter how unlikely final passage may seem. Exempting politicians may be the exception. Already the Golden State's legislative class doesn't have to worry about high gas prices because taxpayers fill up their tanks. They use a \"per diem\" scheme to avoid paying their own high taxes on about $40,000 worth of their $140,000 annualcompensation. Forcing legislators to live under the same crazy laws they expect everyone else to follow may help a few to appreciate the need for true reform.\n",
