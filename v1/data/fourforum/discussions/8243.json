   "Hello everybody. I am currently doing a study project on Homosexuality in all aspects and to help me present it I need to have some interviews with gay rights leaders and or activists. If you could just tell me who you are even if its a fake name, its just for presentations sake, what organization you are associated with, etc, and answer the following questions, I would be endlessly greatful\n\n Hi. I'm Barb D'Tongue.\n I have worked with the HRC and Stop Aids.\n \n \n \n1) Do you believe homosexuals are discriminated against?\n\n Yes. The government does in these ways.\n 1) Military employment. Despite what people say about Don't Ask, Don't Tell, it is still illegal for gays to serve in the military. By the law itself.\n All Clinton did was tone down how aggressively the military hunts for gays in their ranks, and even that has had mixed results....\n \n 2) Adoption. Florida expressly forbids gay adoption. Some other states have laws which allow heterosexual couples to adopt, but homosexual couples cannot.\n \n 3) Marriage. Call it what you will, heterosexual couples can marry and receive over 1,000 rights and privileges that are denied to homosexual couples. In some states, gays can get \"civil unions\" (and equivalents) to help alleviate the discrimination, but none of these are recognized at the Federal level. Not even for Massachusetts' gay marriage.\n \n Gays are also discriminated against in:\n 4) Employment. Only about half of our states have laws which prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. In the states without it, it is perfectly legal to fire a gay man just because he is gay.\n \n 5) Housing goes along with that...\n \n \n \n2)What advancements have been made recently in gay rights?\n\n \"recently\"?\n I'ld say the big one is the revokation of sodomy laws from the law books when the United States Supreme Court recognized sodomy laws were unconstitutional in Lawrence v Texas. A LOT of laws and legal thinking against gays were justified by pointing out that gays engage in sodomy, and thus their actions were illegal. For example, court cases involving custody battles could have one parent point to the other and use this \"illegal\" activity against the other.\n \n Romer v Evans is another big one. Colorado had an amendment which made it unconstitutional for the state to pass any law that prohibited employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The Supreme Court threw that one out as well.\n \n \n \n3)What issues are still needed to be addressed?\n\n 1 through 5 from question 2.\n \n \n \n4) In what ways are they still discriminated against?\n\n 1 through 5 from question 2.\n \n I answered question 2 kind of long, but hopefully covering these other questions makes up for it...",
