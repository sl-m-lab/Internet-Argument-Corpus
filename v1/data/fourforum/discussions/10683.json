   "No, not that I know of.\n \n Polygamy is against the law. Perhaps that's what you're thinking of.\n\n \n Correct.\n \n There are many things that are prohibited by law in the US that religions would accept as part of their beliefs.\n The FLDS are a break away group that says they follow the original Mormon beliefs before the church was forced to cater to the federal gov't and give in on some issues. Polygamy being one of them.\n \n Other issues in the past for examply were animal sacrifice for some groups and they seen rules altered to accept at times IIRC.\n \n As to some groups that are banned.\n Just because you slap the word religion on a cult or scam doesn't mean it actually is. Many 'religions', when looked at with a critical eye are nothing more than manipulatory organizations and common (and illegal) scams in disguise.\n \n Should I be allowed to say 3-Card Monte is my religion?\n \n Freedom of religion shouldn't protect charlatians from legal prosecution.\n \n One example that often pops up in the US is the 'gifting' scheme.\n With the advent and proliferation of the Word of Faith movement and Propserity based sects of Christianity (an estimagted 500 million people in the world follow these movements) can fall easily to scammers as part of their theology is the notion that God wants you physically and financially prosperous (rich) couple this with sermons on how the wealth of the evil ones BELONGS to the tru believer and you find followers with shifting morals who can justify theft and scams to get rich as part of Gods divine will. I've personally heard the sermons from several sources, seen books written dealing with this and noticed some I know engage in it 1st hand.\n \n A 'gifting' scheme is nothing more than a pyramid scheme.\n You invite fellow believers into the scam and have them 'give' you money. Portions of which you pass on to those above you with the implicit promise (by God via the preachers who often sit at the tip of the pyramid) that they will also eventually recieve \"a double portion\" or a \"ten fold return\" (with accompanying biblical passages being used to support this).\n \n Those who lead such often cite that they aren't selling anything and this isn't an 'investment' and thus should not be illegal or considered a pyramid scheme. But they are.\n In the US, they are illegal. In the UK, not so IIRC.\n \n Currently in the US, top WofF pastors are being questioned on their use of tax exempt status to manipulate wealth that benefits them and provides a luxurious lifestyle which is often at odds with charity and religious exemptions.\n \n \n \n Freedom of religion should be respected BUT, you shouldn't be allowed to slap the name 'religion' onto anything to justify yourself.\n Next thing we know, NAMBLA will state it's a religion that glorifies the innocent bodies of the young as divine.\n Or have travelers (gypsies) state that their scams are part of their religious and cultural identity and that any laws against them and prosecutions of their behavior ammount to anti-semetic like pograms.\n Should a revival of the Thugee be allowed to practice their 'religion'?\n \n \n Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go practice my HOLY rites of 'quick change'. The Gods promise me that with their blessings, I can double my prosperity in an afternoon. And the thing is, I don't force anyone to bless me with their funds...they give it to me of their own free will. emoticon_xgood",

When these cases are presented, the media shines a light on them (60 min. 20/20. Various local and national news channels) but, the law is lax in acting on them because the leaders and their cronies shout out freedom of religion, seperation of church and state and then they solicit people like you to come to their aid with the attitude of 'it'll be a domino effect!

The ACLU and lawyers were present.\n The New Agers wanted these practices to be religiously protected as they saw them as a legitimate part of their beliefs...even though they exchanged such services for a FIXED amount of money.\n The ironic thing I saw was that several of the New Age leaders admitted to me in private that they were fakes and possessed no real gift.\n But, as a 'religion' they'd not have to pay taxes nor have a vendors license for 'entertainment' that could be costly.\n \n Think of the Bush admin's attitude to terrorism. 'Look, we haven't had an attack on US soild since 9/11, that MUST mean that our intelligence and anti-terror organizations are working.'\n Not all buy such 'logic'.\n Similar logic is used by the religious con who offers 'supernatural protections'.\n I've got tapes where a pastor promises such protection that will ensure the lives of his followers are free from strife and satanic attack (anything bad that happens in your life is a satanic attack according to their theology).\n And in tapes by the same pastors, when a follower presents them with proof that something bad has happened even though they've followed the dictates of the pastor including giving a lot of money, a car accident for example, the pastor dodges and say's 'well, it must have worked because I'm visiting you in the hospital instead of the funeral home.' Not the same result as promised.\n \n This is fraud. But, since we're dealing with religion, many assume that you participate of your own free will so you are responsible for such.\n \n \n When looking at scientology, tell me exactly what makes it a religion?\n Are 12 step programs a 'religion'?\n Would Sci. qualify as a charity?\n When it came out decades ago, it took on the trapings of an alternative to psychology and had the appearance of self-help and motivational seminars.\n What's changed since then?\n A desire for tax exempt status and the ability to boss followers about and extrot money from them under the same guise other religions have?\n Sounds like it.",

In religion, it's common practice.\n\n \n Common practice, or legal in religion? Not the same thing. If you say it's legal, then again, anything that reasonably falls under the legal definition of extortion is illegal in religion too. But the stuff you speak of is all very iffy stuff. It's all a gray area, too gray to accept such definitiveness on your part. (And the fact it's a gray area is exactly WHY these cases you speak of aren't prosecuted. It's weak evidence.) \n \n Extortion is sometimes a difficult thing to prove in the secular arena too--because it's sometimes a gray area.\n \n Furthermore, I could also argue that the same 'exemption' is allowed for non-religious areas too--if I try to solicit $ for a secular charity by laying guilt on people telling them they're failing to act against the horrors of injustice by not giving and that they'll suffer guilt for it down the road, I'm threatening them with emotion/psychological punishment. That sort of thing happens all the time. I don't think there's nearly the difference in legality between religion and the non-religious as you think. In fact I think the difference is mostly negligible.\n \n And the harm thing (threatening w/physical punishment) you mentioned? No, that's illegal in churches too. If a preacher says the deacons will take you outside and break your legs if you don't tithe, yeah, it's illegal. \n \n \nIf you took time out to investigate, you'll find many religious leaders doing this and when reported, they scream 'freedom of religion' or 'no one is forcing these people to give their money up' which is the same plea con men make.\n\n \n I'm not saying they aren't con-men. There certainly ARE con-men in religion too, but there are definitions in law pertaining to this stuff, and if a religious con-man rips people off, it's still illegal. That's exactly why Jim Baker went to prison. \n \n \nEver witness what goes on when the televangelist turn the cameras off?

It depends on specifics. And the fact it's often iffy is why the law often errs on the side of non-prosecution.\n \n \nAs for the illegality of anything...\n If I threaten you with ANYTHING real or imagined to force you to give me or my organization money, it's illegal.\n\n \n So if you threaten to flog someone with a wet noodle you think it would be illegal? If you threaten them with feelings of guilt, you think it would be illegal? Salespeople would be out of business if we adopted that standard, and many industries which depend on sales would go under. The law doesn't work that way, Zardoz--there has to reasonable cause.\n \n \nIf I promise you anything to get you to give me money and then I don't deliver, it's illegal.\n Fraud. A scam.\n\n \n Yeah, but I see no reason to think that's not also illegal in the religious realm as well.\n \n \nAs for recognized.\n If an organiszation is 'recognized' as a religion, it then get's religious protections and freedoms.\n The lobby groups for these religions can often rival those of secualr business organizations and they DO often work to get laws changed.\n CA. laws were changed to protect groups and their practices, even as they were in the midst of prosecution.\n Even now, most religions don't have to report in detail the operation and financial maneuverings they have to the IRS.\n\n \n This is not substantive, Zardoz. You're equating under-the-table laxness toward churches with legal protections. Not the same thing. \n \n \nChanges to laws to protect religion can be seen in regards to the handling of animals. Sacrific in some instances is now seen as acceptable in the guise of religion where as in a secular setting, it isn't and one could find themselves prosecuted for animal abuse.\n\n \n Well sure, there are indeed cases where, when the American ideal of religious freedom is pitted against other ideals and laws, religious freedom wins out legally. But there are cases where the converse is true as well. This happens with other things too--we sometimes find freedom of speech pitted against freedom of privacy, for instance. Sometimes one wins out, sometimes the other wins out.\n \n \nWhen looking at scientology, tell me exactly what makes it a religion?\n Are 12 step programs a 'religion'?\n Would Sci. qualify as a charity?\n When it came out decades ago, it took on the trapings of an alternative to psychology and had the appearance of self-help and motivational seminars.\n What's changed since then?\n A desire for tax exempt status and the ability to boss followers about and extrot money from them under the same guise other religions have?\n Sounds like it.\n\n \n Maybe. But Scientology itself describes itself as a way \"to achieve certainty of one's relationship with the Supreme Being.\" And it's full of references to the spiritual. The reason we tend to fall on the side of religious freedom even to the potential danger of things like what you call fraud and so forth is that we consider it an extremely important ideal in America. It was a large part of the reason this country was even founded in the first place. That Congress can make no laws respecting the establishment of a religion is in the very 1st item of the Bill of Rights. I tend to agree with that ideal, and IMO religious freedom as an ideal is worth the risk of such things happening that you describe. Any freedom has the potential of being abused or used to malevolent ends. Freedom of speech is one such example.",

We do the same thing here in the U.S. Freedom of religion is the default, but cross the line and you get classified as a cult and lose protected status.\n\n \n I think there are two different things being discussed here--according to the article, Germany is considering BANNING the religion, not just removing a status where they can claim special legal protections. Banning a religion and saying it can't claim legal protections like special tax status are two different things. When you ban someone from engaging in something such as a religion, you're making it illegal for them to do it. It would be illegal for the scientology religion to meet and operate in Germany if Germany enacts this ban. See the difference? \n \n Here in the U.S. anyone can run any whack job cult they want--they can never be banned from doing so. There is no 'line' to cross that would result in a ban of their religion. The only thing that sometimes happens is that when members of a cult break individual laws, perpetrators can be prosecuted just like anyone. Take for instance the Branch Davidian cult in 1993. The only reason the authorities even went there was because they were stockpiling illegal weapons--breaking the law. If the Davidians hadn't done that, they could have gone right on being a whack job cult indefinitely (and still did, I believe, in a limited form). In other words, they weren't banned or targeted because they'd crossed some line, the authorities simply went there because they were doing something specifically illegal. (That's not to say the authorities didn't screw up big time when they got there, but that's a different discussion.) Fundamentalism Mormon churches could never be banned in the U.S., but if someone engages in underage sex with a minor, or engages in polygamy, they can be prosecuted for it because it's a crime, pure and simple. That's not a line in terms of banning the religion, or even taking away it's \"protective status\" (which is mostly just tax issues), but rather simply enforcing laws that everyone is subject to.\n \n Now it may be that scientology, as a religion, is a fraudulent enterprise, but if that is the case, I'd rather see them deal with the problem via basic enforcement of fraud laws rather than just banning a religion altogether. Let the enforcement of current laws deal with the problem, and that way if there are adherents of scientology as a religion that don't engage in fraud, then they will be free to worship or be religious in the way they so choose.",

If people are breaking the law, prosecute them to the full extent of it. \"Religion\" is no excuse for illegal activity. Simply investigate and charge those commiting the fraud. If it can be proven in a court of law that Scientology is scam or based on fraud, then, yes, shut it down.

   " I think there are two different things being discussed here--according to the article, Germany is considering BANNING the religion, not just removing a status where they can claim special legal protections. Banning a religion and saying it can't claim legal protections like special tax status are two different things. When you ban someone from engaging in something such as a religion, you're making it illegal for them to do it. It would be illegal for the scientology religion to meet and operate in Germany if Germany enacts this ban. See the difference? \n\n \n I see the difference, but I still have no idea what you mean by \"by default\". I guess it probably doesn't matter that much, unless it's crucial to your point.\n \n \n\n Now it may be that scientology, as a religion, is a fraudulent enterprise, but if that is the case, I'd rather see them deal with the problem via basic enforcement of fraud laws rather than just banning a religion altogether. Let the enforcement of current laws deal with the problem, and that way if there are adherents of scientology as a religion that don't engage in fraud, then they will be free to worship or be religious in the way they so choose. \n\n \n Ok, but what do the Germans mean by \"banning\" a religion? Seems to me that's an important question. For all we know it could just mean removal of protected status. Perhaps it means that Scientology, as a corporate entity, can't buy property or operate in the country as a legal entity. It could mean, though I sincerely doubt it, that you could get arrested for being a Scientologist. Before condemning Germany for banning a religion it seems to me only fair to know what that actually means.",

And I think this is the best way--there's no feasible way to develop a 'test' or criteria for what constitutes \"real\" religion. Religion in too varied a concept to do that. I think we just have to accept the reality that religious freedom comes with the potential for abuse, as does any freedom.\n \n Now in terms of 'tax exemption' status, I think states determine that by their own standards.

Of course it is. Is it a religion? Apparently reasonable people can disagree. In a hundred years time, if it survives, will it be regarded as a religion? I'll bet it will be.

Now, there are many ex-Scientologists for whom it obviously wasn't true, but what about Tom Cruise?

Now you and I know that Scientology is basically bollocks. Still, it make me recall an article I once read in Skeptical Inquirer about astrology. It made what to me seemed an interesting and valid point, that irrespective of whether astrology was epistemologically true, another significant question to ask was whether it provided a framework for believers in astrology to organise their thinking and their lives. Did it, in some way, though not a scientific way, \"work\" for them, in that they were better off accepting astrology as if it were real than not? The argument here was that astrology served as a mental discipline that, irrespective of its intrinsic truth, helped to focus the thinking of a person in a way that assisted the resolution of problems faced. Almost any discipline might do, in this rubric, it just had to be organised and consistent, in order to seed useful thinking and provide order. It was a purely pragmatic argument: if it works, don't ask too many questions about why.\n \n Now, I don't argue that must be absolutely true, it just struck me as an interesting and novel way to look at the potential utility of otherwise unscientific ideas. So if Scientology \"works\" for some people, and assists them in ways that it cannot assist us, does that make it invalid and worth banning, any more than astrology is worth banning?\n \n \nThe only problem with the test of time, you have to wait so long to get the results.\n\n \n Not much we can do about that! :)",
