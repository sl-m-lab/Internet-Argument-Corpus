   "Some liberal Jews in America say President Bush in his hatred of Jewry pars Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin. Truly, Bush doesn't care about the obvious rise of anti-Semitism sentiment in America. BTW there is even talk of the possible pogroms. I think we don't face the threat just now. As for future I am not equally optimistic. And I am expecting no good from Mr. Bush in this respect. I am working with a charity fund. Relating this sphere, I am ready with exact figures. Of the $100 million so far dispensed to faith based charities by Bush administration, not one dollar has gone to a Jewish organization. This doesn't add happiness you know. My grannies came here from Russia in search for democracy and better secure life. Times are changing. Now some of my relatives in Russia are quite well-off. They say Russia's economy is taking off, which makes it perfectly for profitable investments. And they are feeling safe there. Frankly, I wouldn't like to leave. But if it goes this way I'll forced to.",
