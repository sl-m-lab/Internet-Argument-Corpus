The article is making insinuations, it's not trying to convince you with provable, or disprovable, assertions. \"Tourists complained\".

My point is that the article tries to make it sound like gays are just calling straights \"breeders\" at random. My guess, and we can only guess given how few details the article has, is that the straights were acting homophobic to some degree. That doesn't justify what happened to them, but it does present a different take on it than the one the article tried to present.",
