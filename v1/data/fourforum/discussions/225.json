My throat is throbbing right now!!!! My sisters b-day party is today at 4:00 and I have to go. Got any advice on how to get my voice back or to make my throat to feel better in about4 hrs. with no money?",

   "Here is a great thing to do (sounds weird but it works!).\n \n Mix a small cup of warm water with a teaspoon of salt and gargle with it. (Don't swallow it!)\n \n Then squeeze some lemon juice into a small cup and mix it with a little bit of honey. Drink up!\n \n The salt water will loosen up the phlegm in your throat and the lemon-honey stuff helps to numb and soothe your throat. Believe me, I went to camp one year and had totally lost my voice right before a play we were supposed to do. I had 80% of my voice back after doing this. I works miracles! Hot tea will help you to keep your voice afterwards. :)",

   "YES YES, Calligirl 's ways are the best to deal with some minor throat disease problem if you think its not so serious and don't want to consult doctor right at the moment. \n \n I did try that too and they works !\n And that's some Doctor prefer us to do at home by ourselves as well.\n \n \nThe salt water will loosen up the phlegm in your throat \n\n \n But I have some ideas about the above quote,\n \n The loosen up of phlegm is due to the warmth (hotter preferred ) of salt water by expands the trachea (theory:- substance expands when hot), so phlegm comes out more easily from coughing, and \"salt\" water killing germs of the throat due to osmosis that shrinks the germ's cell to death.\n \n \n I suppose debategirl must have been recovered for a long time when the time I post this message, sorry I was too late to come here, hehe :D",
