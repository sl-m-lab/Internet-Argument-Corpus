Despite continued improvement in both the reported annual net operating cost and cash-based budget deficit, the U.S. government's total reported liabilities, net social nsurance commitments, and other fiscal exposures continue to grow and now total approximately $53 trillion-up more than $2 trillion during fiscal year 2007 and more than $32 trillion from about $20 trillion in fiscal year 2000. The fiscal and cash flow implications of our large and growing Social Security and Medicare commitments will be felt as the large \"baby boom\" generation leaves the work force and collects benefits. In fact, the first boomers already have filed for early retirement benefits. The budget and economic implications of the baby boom generation's retirement will only intensify as the baby boomers age. Given these and other factors, it seems clear that our nation is on an imprudent and unsustainable long-term fiscal path that is getting worse with the passage of time. The issues raised by this long-term fiscal challenge are issues of significance that affect every American. Leadership and the efforts of many people will be needed to put our nation on a more prudent and sustainable longer-term fiscal path. \n \n \n \nMost large corporations have ways of reducing taxes to minimal amounts.

   "There is no proof or data to suggest that companies leave for tax reasons. In fact, there is good knowledge to suggest this may not be true including the incredible cost of infrastructure needed for companies to go overseas.\n\n \n This is 100% true and ties into the tax discussion earlier (individual taxation). In the real world, when companies relocate overseas it is not just a 10 minute decision. One of the biggest things they consider is infrastructure improvement costs. Here in the US a company can built a new plant and at little or not cost to them (becuase the government subsidizes it) they can get pretty much any electrical service they require, road build out is done by the government and water and gas lines appear as if by magic. When a US company reloacates overseas, those things do not happen. If the company needs a 1000 amp power build out, they pay for it, full cost, directly. The same goes for water, sewer, gas, you name it. I have done a lot of analysis for companies interested in relocating production facilities where the cost of infrastructure buildout is 2-3x construction and tooling costs for the entire plant. Companies GLADLY pay their taxes in the US because the benefits when it comes to infrastructure are so great. I know for a fact that at least 70% of the companies I have done relocation analysis for are ONLY still here in the US because of the infrastructure costs involved in moving.\n \n It is NOT the taxes that are driving companies out of the US, it is the labor costs. Will a company use every legal trick in the book to ensure that they do not pay any more taxes than necessary? Of course. So do I. That does not mean I feel my taxes are unfairly high, it means I am not an idiot. \n \n VERY few wealthy people that I have ever known (\"wealthy\" being an individual or family with a net worth over $5 million) complain about the amount they are taxed. A LOT (if not all of them) complain about how their money is spent, but not the level of taxation. There are a few notable exceptions like Forbes, but he is an idiot and nobody listens to him anyway. \n \n Wealthy people pay more taxes, and SHOULD pay more taxes, because they derive more benefit from the system. Bad news, folks, the american dream is a myth. It does not actually matter how hard you work, you are never, ever going to get ahead unless you understand the system. If bill gates had been born on a Brazillian sugar cane plantation, he would still be a BRazillian sugar cane plantation worker today. It was not JUST brains and hard work that got him where he is, it is the fact that he was lucky enough to be born into a system where conditions existed to allow him to leverage his intellignece and his idea into a multi billion dollar empire. \n \n I still do not understand why the middle class gets up in arms about how much the wealthy pay in taxes. As near as I can figure, they actually believe in the myth of the american dream and believe that someday they may actually have to pay those taxes. BAD NEWS, folks, as things currently stand, 99.45% of the american middle class that breaks out of the middle class will \"break into\" the lower class, so how much wealthy people have to pay in taxes really should not be a concern. Don;t worry about it. The wealthy run this country. If they decide their taxes are too high, they will have them lowered. \n \n Besides the sytsemic benefit argument, there is also a practical argument for the wealthy paying higher taxes (though it is certainly attached to the systemic benefit argument). The wealthy do not have to work as hard for their money as the unwashed masses do. The first 5 million is the hardest. After that you can pull $300,000 per year in zero risk investments if you want. Assuming your house is paid for, you can live pretty well on that, even after taxes. By the time you reach that point, though, you know enough about how the system works to make a LOT more than that. \n \n There was an excellent example this week in the spot currency market. To anybody who actually has a good understanding of how our monetary system works, what kind of condition our financial system is actually in, and how currency markets work, this weeks tradings was a no brainer. The biggest high cap trades this week (high cap being more than 50 lots in a single trade..a lot being $100,000) was an entry on the euro at 1.48 with an exit at 1.52. Those orders were being placed on MONDAY. Figure $10 per pip per lot, 400 pips between 1.48 and 1.52, and even with the minimum high cap trade, you are still looking at $60,000, you didn't have to be there to do it, and there was pretty much no risk. If the government wants 35% of that, no problem. It is not like you actually worked for it.",

If you penalize growth (ie. profits/income) that money will go build factories in China or something. It will not stick around to help this country. Cut taxes, grow economy.\n\n \n Says who?? We keep hearing this but nobody has ever actually managed to prove it becuase we have never seen tax cuts coupled with government spending cuts. Every single bit of growth fron the Reagan era when this particualr bastardization of sound economic theory was popular can be traced DIRECTLY to deficit spending. It is not like the connection is even difficult to find...it is linear. Chart them on a graph and you pretty much only have to draw one line.\n \n This is an EXTREME oversimplification of the concept of taxable income elasticity. In modern terms (the concept is actually thousands of years old), the laffer curve. The idea is basically that there is an optimum rate of taxation...a rate that provides maximum government revenue without stifling growth. \n \n Maximizing government revenue is actually important in modern governments because government spending is the second most efficient engine for economic growth (the most efficient being natural resource extraction) in GDP terms. Government spending actually has a flow through multiplier of six, which is pretty good. This is because government spending is targeted 100% at encouraging domestic growth. There are provisions in government supply contracts that you do not see other places such as \"American made\" requirements and requirements for small business spending. Government spending also ensures infrastructure improvement.\n \n This is something that people have trouble getting their heads around. From a macroeconomic standpoint, as long as we are not on the wrong side of the laffer curve, maximizing government revenue is a GOOD thing when it comes to growth.\n \n Where you get into trouble is when the government gets into deficit spending, and the WORSE thing you can have is deficit spending on your military. That is all non value added spending. It gives the economy a boost as far as the numbers go, but the boost is artificial and eventually it WILL come back and bite you in the caboose. \n \n Trust me on this, consulting is as close as I get to honest work anymore and I have come to specialize on production relocation or outsourcing. NOBODY leaves the country because of our taxes. It just does not happen.

Doing nothign will crash the economy. At this point we are just plain screwed. IF we cut defense spending by 80% and raised taxes across the board by 20%,w e could meet future liabilities except for the inconvenient economic crash since that may well put us on the wrong side of the laffer curve. If, on the other hand, we cut SS benefits, the bomd markets see it as a default on those bonds, US treasuries trade as junk, and there is an inconvenient economic crash. \n \n The math simply does not line up anymore. We are talking SERIOUS tax hikes and SERIOUS spending cuts to have any hope of getting out of this and we will still have to rely on foreign debt purchase to pull us through, and even now foreign interest in our debt is falling off a cliff. For some reason asians do not want to buy our bonds which yield under 5% when our currency is falling at 10% per year. Damn those asians and their high mathematical competency!",

I truly object to those that believe they have a \"right\" to those tax dollars for any of the numerous reasons listed here, primarily the \"the value of money\". That's ridiculous to my mind.\nI suggest you read Adam Smith's guide to a good tax system (it is what we are based on). The fact that you believe in a progressive tax structure is inherently admitting that my value of money argument is true because that's one of the concepts it is based on along with the ability to pay.\n \n \nProvide some proof. A link, anything other than simple assertion.\n \n I would argue that the \"poor\" are far larger users of public resources - public schools, healthcare, welfare, public transit, etc... etc..., the list goes on and on. That barely scratches the surface and there are some big $$$$ items there.\nThen you show proof the poor use public resources more. Public transit is not a high dollar item and public schools are less for the poor because they are normally in poorer areas resulting in lower wage teachers and what not. In terms of federal spending you could claim the old people use it the most.",

   "What I was commenting on is the threat to seize profits. If the govt. begins summarily seizing profits, as Hillary says, companies will move in a heartbeat. That's what the thread's about. I, too, don't mind paying taxes, it is an investment in the country. But, and again, I think the thread is about this, there is a concerted effort to penalize success. Of course the rich and filthy rich should pay higher taxes, and they do. But seizing wealth, individual or company, is a sure way to ruin the country. The reason people rail against this, is that it is offensive and an affront to our sense of fair play and the American way!\n\n \n Hillary is not threatening or even trying to seize profits. She is talking about instituting a windfall tax.\n \n Now, if Exxon decides that they want to abandon their trillion dollars in fixed assets here in the US and give up access to the #1 market for their product, they would be free to do so. HOWEVER, they are going to have trouble finding anywhere decent on the planet to go, because to the best of my knowedge the US is the only first world nation on the planet that does not ALREADY have a windfall tax for corporate profits. \n \n Now, if we actually wanted to be FAIR, we would go back and make the major oil companies pay the $90 BILLION in royalites that they have stiffed the US on in the last 30 years (just didn't bother to pay them) and then go in and do some major trust busting and break their refinery operations off and make them actually (**GASP**) compete in the free market. \n \n MY GOD, people, we are talking about a corporate tax here, not a socialist revolution. Lets drop the rhetoric down just a little bit and try to stay a little closer to the realm of reality.",

Further, this whole climate of anti-business and anti-success is dangerous and anti-productive!\n\n \n No, the crack spread is less than 10%...the amount they make by turning the crude oil into gasoline or refined products. BUT, since they own the refineries and refine their own oil, the profit is on the back end. \n \n THAT is why they are willing to get stuck with a windfall tax. The other alternative would be to go in and do some old school trust busting and break off their refining arms. That would put them in a situation where they actually have to act as traditional suppliers and behave in a competitive manner. It would put an end to the way oil is currently traded, but that is just fine as the current arrangement is an anti free market arrangement that was designed and implemented (literally) by the oil companies specifically to avoid having to restructure the industry so it acts competitively. \n \n You do realize that this would not be the first time the oil industry was hit with a windfall tax, right? The first one was enacted in 1980 under Reagan and was targeted specifically at the oil industry as a result of their record proifts due to the Arab oil embargo. They were literally given a choice then....either accept the tax or we restructure the industry into a competitive one. They chose the tax. In fact, Exxon hired lobbyists to help get is passed and spent several million dollars on advertising to sell it to the American people. \n \n The simple fact of the matter is that the structure of the oil industry is anti competitive and if not for a long history of legislative involvement, it would have been restructured decades ago. That is the LAST thing the oil industry wants. They would MUCH rather pay the tax.",

However, their profit margins are not high and, again, the govt. makes lots more per gallon. Furthermore, we're just about the cheapest place on earth for gas. I've got no problem paying it. \n Hillary's mentioned the oil companies, the credit card companies, and on and on. I'm not going to change my mind about the hostility toward success in this country right now. It's not just the oil companies, it's anyone who 'makes good'. It's as if there's this belief that anyone who's successful must be crooked (or a crook). I believe it's dangerous and UnAmerician.

If energy was 'expensive' people certainly wouldn't need reminding to 'save' energy. \n If the oil companies were 'sticking it to us' people wouldn't be driving their hummers and SUV's back to the store for a gallon of milk, they'd wait until they were heading out for something else.

There is no question that the oil industry in the US is basically an anti competitive mess. The idea that we could actually break it up, though, is a little far fetched. Frankly you are talking about a HUGE amount of corporate power there. Go after them to break it up and your political career would be measured in days, regardless of the office you hold.\n \n This is why Reagan supported and got passed the windfall tax in the 80's and why hillary is suggesting it now. Reagan was banking (and was right) that the American people were fed up enough with high energy prices to want to punish somebody, and that their anger would counterbalance the political forces that the oil companies could bring to bear. We are in an unfortunate situation where ultimatly Americas largest companies have more power than any of our politicians. \n \n I think Hillarys other motive in this, getting money for AE research and investment, is actually a good idea. I have been eyeing the concept of peak oil and various timelines for several years now and it seems that we have reached the point where we can say for sure that the worlds oil production has either peaked, or that it will in the very near future. I think it is also fair to say that the fact we have not started preparing for it already, and in a BIG way, means that we are probably screwed. \n \n On the other hand, the governments interventions in alternative energy research so far have pretty much been a disaster.

This is also shown in the book Health Economics and Development which is another World Book publication. \n\n \n What is the World Book data based on? World wide, or USA only? There is a MAJOR difference there.\n \n \nI'll be the first to admit that this is by far the weakest argument (as you can't prove either way really)...the ability to pay argument is a better one.\n\n \n If that's your best arguement, then your position is pretty weak.\n \n \nIf 2 people agree to something then can be said to be fair. Contracts are the best example of this. You may sell a car to me for $1000 under its FMV (Fair Market Value) yet this transaction can still be said to be fair because we both agreed upon it.\n\n \n That's ridiculous. I can't even believe you're honestly trying to push this notion.\n \n If I agree to sell you my $50,000 car for $5000 because I'm desperate, is that fair? Give me a break Steeeve.\n \n That idea that something is fair because two people agreed to it is absurd, plain and simple.\n \n \nIt's not absurd...there really aren't many reasons to adopt a progressive tax structure. I'd assume you agree with the ability to pay or you wouldn't support the system at all.\n\n \n Exactly, there really aren't any reasons, other than those that can afford to pay, have CHOSEN to do so by implementing the progressive tax system. You can claim that they have to pay, and I suppose the IRS can go after them, but if everyone refused to pay into the progressive tax system, it would be changed. It would only take political will.\n \n \nAn ordered society is a fairly weak argument (but still one used) for the progressive tax system. There is nothing to state the fair tax would cause chaos so why not support that over the progressive tax structure? Most would reason it is because there are other reasons for a progressive tax structure.\n\n \n It's the only argument that I can see having any merit. Tax dollars have to come from somewhere if we're going to maintain the society we've become accustomed too, the only way to do that is with the progressive tax system and the continued contribution of those that pay 90% of the bill.\n \n Waxy",

I personally think the seller deserves what he gets in the deal - a deal is a deal - but that doesn't mean the deal was fair, he either got ripped off or willingly dumped the vehicle at a greatly reduced price and cost himself considerable money. Either way, I would call the transaction, and specifically the price paid for the vehicle, unfair. There is a clear winner and loser in that deal.\n \n I could supply an endless list of transactions that aren't fair to one party or another (many of them I've been involved with myself), and yet have still been agreed upon for one reason or another.

They are all voting for somebody ELSES best interests. \n \n The whole tax thing is the best example I can imagine for this. Bushs tax cuts ultimately resulted in a tax decrease ONLY for the wealthy. By stopping transfer payments to the states, state and local governments have raised taxes to make up the shortfall and while the top 10% of americans pay the bulk of the federal tax bill, they only make up about 12% of the state and local tax base. The net result has been an average INCREASE of 13% in taxation when you factor in state and local taxes for the middle class. And yet the middle class is the only place that extending the Bush tax cuts has any actual support. I saw an interesting poll on this the other day. Apparently only about 21% of upper class Americans (\"upper\" meaning more than 10 million in assets) approve of making the tax cuts permanent, while 53% of middle class Americans do. \n \n This thread is another pretty good example of middle class Americans voting against their interests. Shock at the idea of taxing the oil companies mega profits is insane. That money does NOT end up back in the shareholders pockets. Exxons dividend payments on common stock end up being about 1% of net profits. With the fiscal problems this country is facing it is absolutely and without doubt in the best interests of the middle class to tax them as hard as we can. Instead the middle class spouts foolish rhetoric like \"they will leave the country.....\" Is the middle class REALLY that gullible?",

   "A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world's greatest civilizations has been 200 years. \n\n \n \n I disagree that 'democracy cannot exist' permanently. I do agree that we must guard against a 'tyranny of the majority' when it comes to spending. That is why I believe fiscally conservative policies are extremely important to this country. That is why I shudder to think of the government becoming a nanny to anyone who doesn't feel like trying to make it in life.\n \n Also, the I'd have to say the collapse of other 'great' civilizations have been for reasons other than tax policy or even finances in general. Mostly you get internal strife, external wars, or a hodge podge of colonies and captured territories that revert back to local control. With our instant communications and fast transportation, I doubt we're going anywhere for a while. \n Disasters have also been another cause of collapse. Short of an ELE comet hit or some plague that kills 99% of the population, I think we're stronger than that too. Although a Nuc. war would probably do it!\n \n Now as far a any group being a better example of power Ho's, I'd have to say Mexican political parties take the cake. Whether its the PRI or the PAN who wins the election, you get nearly 100% turn over in the bureaucracy. Talk about using the govt. as a personal piggy bank.\n \n Another thing I can't get behind is the posit that 'the wealthy agree that they should pay more.' Anytime I hear a rich lib from hollowwood (or Warren Buffet, for that matter) stand up and complain that they don't pay enough, I want to laugh in their faces. I mean, how apocryphal can you get? Anyone who wants to 'donate' more is welcome to do so. I don't want to hear that someone thinks they don't pay enough, its a lie (unless they do donate more, but I've never seen that!)\n \n If we need more money to cover the necessary functions of govt., raise taxes. But it should be done in the proper way and for the right reasons and I don't believe we're there yet. There IS a negative effect of overtaxation on the economy. I've stated before, I don't mind paying my fair share and I expect others to pay theirs as well. But the thought of taxing to punish, or 'equalize' is offensive to me. Don't tax anyone to alleviate others of their responsibility to look after themselves.\n \n Personally, I think that the best hope for the US is the Fair Tax. By enacting the fair tax, 14 trillion dollars could come out of tax shelters (that is the result of tax policy! The money isn't put to work in our economy) and it's unimaginable what would happen as far as companies moving here from around the world!

Every single one in the history of the planet. ANY war can be won if you throw enough money at it. \n \n \n Bulls#@t! Empires like the Minoan were devastated by a volcano! The Incan empire, stacked floor to ceiling with gold, fell because the conquistadors had the king, and because they were 'shocked and awed' by the Spaniards! The Aztecs fell because of Plague (nat. disaster!), and because many of the hodge podge small tribes they'd conquered revolted. If the Aztecs had instant communication, they'd have easily taken out Cortes, period. The rich Persians fell because the Greeks were able to take their leader out of commission! The dirt poor Mongols were able to take over the richest kingdom of their time (China) because of brutal tactics, better weapons, and FASTER communications. Spain fell because their Navy was lost in a hurricane. The English empire was dismantled after the wars. How did the Vietnamese win if its all about money? Your hypothesis, while being a contributing factor to some events is hardly THE reason every empire (or country) has fallen. The USSR was certainly money, but it was also lack of legitimacy and inability to compete coupled with the longing of its citizens to be free. Some times the reduction in money is the result of other factors as well. Cooling temps or drought can cause several years of bad harvests (back then) and can cause the civilization to backslide. New religions (esp. in Middle East) have caused some countries to be taken over. Many countries and empires have fallen or been taken over for many reasons other than money, period. So don't get so uppity, cause you're the one who's wrong. \n \n \n \n \n### does \"instant communications\" have to do with anything? Does the fact I can pick up my cellphone from anywhere on the planet and call anyone in the united states make the 146% decrease in spending outside of SS and Medicare that we would have to achieve mathematically possible?

It is that simple. \n\n \n Instant communications allows threats to be met quickly, as in the Aztecs and many other empires that fell to internal rebellions. That and the fact the we're a homogeneous, non-empire will ensure that no internal or external threats will over come the US. And I don't give a s#@t about your cell phone, that's not even what we're talking about.\n \n \nYou are again wrong. A bankrupt country fails.

A 100% tax rate at this point would not solve the problem. Bad news. The rules apply to us, too. \n \n \n Again, Bulls@#t. Germany after WWI was as broke as they come. It pulled itself out. Not all bankrupt countries fail, many have overcome. As to the US. The US is hardly a confederacy of states as it was 100+ years ago. Now people are more mobile and less loyal to THE STATE. No longer are there the tensions and whatnot between the people of 'rival' states. In MD, where I'm from, the MD guys and Va guys would have gun battles over fishing areas in the Chesapeake. Now people are more US citizens first, so I highly doubt we're going to collapse into 50 separate countries (Red state Blue state would be far more likely, but even that's nearly impossible). When people realize what they're doing by obligating the govt. to pay for all the dead weight, there will be changes. The retirement age will go up 10 years as will Medicaid and etc.\n \n \n \n \nThe only really wealthy person I have ever known who objected to their level of taxation was Forbes. Now, every single wealthy person I have ever known has had a problem with how their tax money is spent, which is probably why instead of donating to the federal government they donate hundreds of billions to private charity funds. \n\n \n Still more BS!

I said the penalizing of the producers and the seizure of profits is wrong. Changing the rules in the middle of the game is wrong. Starting new govt. bureaucracies is wrong. Increasing spending is wrong. There's nothing wrong with our taxes (well, yes there is but not in principal, we could have a better system), unless they are punitive taxes or money grabs.\n \n \n \nUntil resigning in disgust, the comptroller of the United states spent the last couple years touring the nation and trying to make people understand that the federal government is almost BANKRUPT. 6 times in the last 8 years the us Treasury secretary has gotten up in front of congress and testified that the government is ALREADY functionally bankrupt, and that if steps are not taken we will soon be INSOLVENT. \n \n At exactly what point do you think that raising taxes becomes appropriate? \n \n You are right, there is a negative effect to over-taxation, and as far as we can tell it kicks in at about an 80% tax rate. \n \n Nobody is trying to punush anybody or equalize anything.

In fact, many who rail against it do so simply because they want to punish the rich. Even though the fair tax would fix almost every problem in the country and even though it is the ONLY plan that would totally remove ALL TAX burden (federal) from the poor, even though it would mean MUCH MORE money in everyone's pocket, since it's not punitive enough against the rich, it is denounced by libs. And your example of the tax shelters is completely off base. The reason I mentioned that money is because it is not WORKING as INVESTMENT to create jobs since its being hidden by all those people who are begging to pay more taxes. Not that it would be spent directly to gain taxes income. But it would create about 50-70 million jobs if it went into investments. The fair tax would be such a boon to the US, just think of the cost of the IRS would be gone (billions) and the compliance arms of corps. and personal incomes wouldn't be a drag (something like $300 billion) on the economy alone. Then think of all the business in say the EU who could come here and only pay labor, no taxes; you think they wouldn't jump? You, buddy, are wrong about a lot of things!",

Jobs deal with labor costs and while you correctly state that the employer side taxes for labor go away, you still have the issue of the labor now demanding that much more money to pay for their sales tax.\n \n \nThere is ALREADY a 22% inclusive tax on everything you buy retail. This comes out. Than it is replaced with a 23% inclusive tax. Only 1% more. Just receiving your entire paycheck without witholding will cover that difference. And this doesn't take into account the increase in pay nor the increased efficiency of business allowing them to bring the products cheaper. (Not to mention, for the first time, people here illegall will have to pay taxes!)\nRight, but it is revenue neutral so you still have the same revenue and if you have the same revenue either 1) the burden is the same across rich, middle, and poor; 2) the burden shifts among those three. It has been shown that those between 40,000-100,000 (at best) will pay more taxes under the fair tax. Even the fair tax people admit this. \n \n The math is also a little \"fuzzy\" if you will pardon my 2000 Election reference. There is a 22% embedded tax that will be gone...or so is said. Two main problems with this. One, it won't be totally gone because companies will still be paying the sales tax for supplies and materials right? Even if that doesn't hold up you still have the problem of revenue neutrality. If you loss 22% in a product you have to make up that 22% elsewhere because it is revenue neutral. Basically all you do is shift that burden to the consumer as opposed to the company (in terms of physically paying it to the government...it is said the consumer always paid it anyway). \n \n This quote from a fair tax supporter (the author of the Fair Tax Book) says it best:\n We explained in the book that the FairTax plan was revenue neutral. By this we meant revenue neutral for everyone ... the government, businesses and individuals. You can't put more money in the pockets of one without taking money out of the pockets of another. The harsh reality is that politicians would not support the FairTax if it meant less revenue for the federal government; business leaders would not support the FairTax if it meant a decrease in corporate earnings and profits, and the people would most certainly not support the FairTax if it meant a decrease in their income. Taking a snapshot view of our economy, an increase in income in one of these sectors would necessarily mean a decrease in another. This is why the FairTax was designed to be absolutely revenue neutral - leaving everyone pretty much where they are in terms of income or revenue. To put it more bluntly, there is no free lunch in the FairTax plan. There is no \"something-for-nothing.\"\n\n Basically the Fair Tax supporters have conceded that the fair tax doesn't make you \"better off\" just because of it...they claim it will grow our economy and you will be better off when that happens. I see no reasoning for how this will grow our economy. You can't increase the tax burden of the middle class and expect the economy to skyrocket. You can't claim businesses will pay less taxes because it is revenue neutral so businesses will still pay plenty of taxes (or the burden on the people would have gone up a great deal). So how does it grow the economy!?\n \n \nAs I said earlier, if costs go up 1% but your take home pay goes up 17% you are better off!\nWell who is paying that salary increase? From my viewpoint, I'm seeing a \"something for nothing\" argument which can't be the case unless someone pays somehow (which kills the argument). Revenue neutral taxes. I assumed in my last post that salaries wouldn't go up anymore than the savings from employment taxes. If this is wrong and salaries go up more than you assume a fair tax will cause some company to fork over more money which doesn't make sense. If salaries only go up by the amount saved by switching tax systems then there has to be another way to maintain neutral revenue given the fact that the middle class will pay more in taxes. Either the middle class will expand or the middle class have a larger burden and really aren't \"better off\". I don't see the middle class expanding as a result of the fair tax.",

Now did they change the tax system and over a few years did more companies come up or was it another factor or combination of factors? I really don't know but I can look into it.

DE is all factories (well, and chicken houses and mobile homes) and has continually had a much better economy than the neighboring MD counties. I'll ask them about the current situation. They don't have a sales tax either in DE.\nI'm not saying DE has a bad economy, I'm just doubting the tax structure is the result of it. Virginia's economy, as an example, was better when we raised our sales tax. So tax structure and policy isn't the only factor...in fact, probably not a large one unless you have the taxes of New Jersey.\n \n \nThe cheaper collection (no IRS), the taxation of those who don't pay anything now (Illegals) right off the bat will bring it in.

I mean, the tax code is like 250K pages long!\nYou would replace the IRS with someone else. But like I said the savings wouldn't be as much as you think because the compliance costs were jobs. Now that those are gone you have to employ those people some other way which negates any benefit. You can't increase wealth without any production of something. In other words, saving money is not a wealth producing asset by itself. You argue more people will be paying into the system but this isn't really a proven fact. People evade taxes one way or the other and to assume it will go to zero is a poor estimate in my opinion.\n \n \nTax is only collected by the end-user, at the register. It eliminates all payroll taxes and wholesale (as well as corporate and etc.). Now if I went to Office Depot and bought something retail for my business I'd have to pay it. Of course, all citizens get a pre-bate check, I'm not sure about small businesses though, I'd have to look it up.\n Then no business taxes (which I am pretty sure is wrong by the way...business buy things all the time and pay sales tax. You only don't pay it when it isn't a finished product) means that this now should be paid by the consumer. This is fine like I suggested but it does two things 1) raises income 2) taxes a higher percentage of this income. This is obviously neutral but avoids the point that I make which is the burden would be shifted to the middle class. At the end of the day a middle class citizen has paid more in taxes as a percentage of income on 12/31/xx than under the income tax. \n \n \nAgain, look to where its been tried, like Ireland. Also I believe it is evident that money, now in tax shelters comes into the economy, and you offer a place for EU and other companies to set up shop tax free, we should see tremendous growth. I admit that it can't be exactly quantified, which is why none of those (positive) outcome calculations have been factored into the plan.\nI'm going to have to see some data on this and Ireland's structure. I know the fair tax idea wasn't what Ireland did. In fact, they seem to have adopted a version of what I proposed...with keeping the income tax. They have a VAT with a low corporate tax. Now a VAT is much different from a sales tax and actually does tax corporations thus negated that lower income tax rate. \n \n Singapore as an example is doing very well and yet their income tax rate is higher than Irelands with a low VAT. I don't think there is any correlation between having a VAT and economic boom.\n \n \nThe labor costs initially go down because of withholding. Obviously, some of that money will, rightly, go to labor and the rest is savings to the company. Also, no compliance costs and fancy tax strategy planning make them more efficient. Also, once the labor costs go up because of increased competition for labor, they should be selling more product anyway. Remember there is a lot of savings (from the payroll, compliance, AND profit taxes) so they can handle paying labor more money.\nIt is revenue neutral though. You can only look at the point that tax begins because to assume economic boom is dangerous. Because of it being revenue neutral there is no tax savings just shifts of who is paying it. This is all that matters and the middle class will be paying more than under the income tax as a percentage of income. So really, there is no savings. Like what was said, the fair tax does not give you \"something for nothing\". \n \n \n \nAgain, they'll have already received their pre-bate checks.

I think it's academic that for many the US will be irresistible.\nThere are no savings though because of it being revenue neutral. The compliance costs aren't really a savings either because now those people have to be employed. The rich don't pay more. The middle class between 40k and 100k pay more as a percentage of income. \n \n \nThe accountants are highly trained professionals. \nWhy thank you :)\n \n \nThey will be able to find jobs easily when the $13 trillion (or whatever it turns out to be) starts to work creating new jobs. I'm not suggesting that it will be completely painless. There are birth pains with almost anything. But long term, you yourself said things are bad (if not doomed) so if we've got to work through the pain, we'll do so. Little that is worth while is easy and some may be hurt in the short term. But that's a small price to pay for, what could be, salvation.\n Tax accountants (and I'm not a tax accountant but a financial reporting accountant) are specialized in that area which is very different from the rest of accounting. They would pretty much need to be retrained and go back to college. All of this for the benefit of what? There is no benefit other than a few less headaches which would probably would happen anyway when the switch was attempted to be made. There is no evidence it would help the economy and it wouldn't generate any more tax revenue...and under the current law might produce less. You penalize spending as opposed to production but that is really a wash so no benefit there. Finally, you kill the ability to pay concept by taxing the middle class more than the rich (again, as a percentage of income). \n \n Those downsides don't seem to add up to any value in my book.",

Also, it takes the power out of the hands of congress, no small benefit there.\n \n Below is from the creators of the fair tax, it talks about revenue neutrality and how some people have to change the fair tax to make it not work...\n \n \n Kotlikoff Study: 23% FairTax = Revenue Neutral\n October 2, 2006 \u00b7 Filed under: Education\n Thanks to (FairTax critic) Hayden Kepner for pointing out that Boston University Economics Professor Laurence Kotlikoff's much-anticipated study of the necessary revenue-neutral rate for the FairTax has been published and released.\n \n Actually, the study was conducted by several economists in the Beacon Hill Institute at Suffolk University, including Paul Bachman and Jonathan Haughton, with help from Kotlikoff.\n \n The full study is available on Kotlikoff's web site at Boston University and I'm making it available here on our site as well.\n \n Here is the abstract:\n \n Abstract\n \n As specified in Congressional bill H.R. 25/S. 25, the FairTax is a proposal to replace the federal personal income tax, corporate income tax, payroll (FICA) tax, capital gains, alternative minimum, self-employment, and estate and gifts taxes with a single-rate federal retail sales tax. The FairTax also provides a prebate to each household based on its demographic composition. The prebate is set to ensure that households pay no taxes net on spending up to the poverty level. \n \n Bill Gale (2005) and the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform (2005) suggest that the effective (tax inclusive) tax rate needed to implement H.R. 25 is far higher than the proposed 23% rate. This study, which builds on Gale's (2005) analysis, shows that a 23% rate is eminently feasible and suggests why Gale and the Tax Panel reached the opposite conclusion. \n \n This paper begins by projecting the FairTax's 2007 tax base net of its rebate. Next it calculates the tax rate needed to maintain the real levels of federal and state spending under the FairTax. It then determines if an effective rate of 23% would be sufficient to fund 2007 estimated spending or if not, the amount by which non-Social Security federal expenditures would need to be reduced. Finally, it shows that the FairTax imposes no additional real fiscal burdens on state and local government, notwithstanding the requirement that such governments pay the FairTax when they purchase goods and services. \n \n Implementing the FairTax rate of 23% would produce $2,586 billion in federal tax revenues which is $358 billion more than the $2,228 billion in tax revenues generated by the taxes it repeals. Adjusting the base for the prebate and the administrative credit paid to businesses and states for collecting the tax results in a net tax base of $9,355 billion. In 2007, spending at current levels is projected to be $3,285 billion. Revenues from the FairTax at a 23% tax rate, plus other federal revenues, are estimated to yield $3,209 billion which is $76 billion less than current CBO spending projections for 2007. The $76 billion amounts to only 2.73% of non-Social Security spending ($2,177 - $2,101). This is a remarkably small adjustment when set against the more than 30% rise in the real value of these expenditures since 2000. \n \n Ensuring real revenue neutrality at the federal level, given the net base of $9,355 billion, implies a rate of 23.82% on a tax-inclusive basis and 31.27% on a tax-exclusive basis. These and other calculations presented here ignore a) general equilibrium feedback (supply-side and demand-side) effects that could significantly raise the FairTax base (see, for example, Kotlikoff and Jokisch, 2005), b) the possibility that tax evasion would exceed the considerable amount automatically incorporated here via the use of NIPA data, which undercount consumption expenditures due to evasion under the current tax system, and c) the roughly $1 trillion real capital gain the federal government would secure on its outstanding nominal debt, were consumer prices to rise by the full amount of the FairTax. \n \n The FairTax redistributes real purchasing power from state and local governments to their state and local income-tax taxpayers. It does so by reducing factor prices relative to consumer prices and, thereby, reducing the real value (measured at consumer prices) of state and local income tax payments, which are assessed on factor incomes (namely, factor supplies times factor prices). \n \n Gale (2005) and the Tax Panel (2005) recognized this loss in real state and local government revenues in claiming that these governments need to be compensated for having to pay the FairTax. But what they apparently missed is that this loss to these governments is exactly offset by a gain to their taxpayers. \n \n Were state and local governments to maintain their real income tax collections - the assumption made here - by increasing their tax rates appropriately, their taxpayers' real tax burdens would remain unchanged and there would be no need for the federal government to compensate state and local governments for having to pay the FairTax on their purchases. The second is that H.R. 25 does not preclude state and local governments from levying their sales taxes on the FairTax-inclusive price of consumer goods and services. This produces significantly more revenue compared to levying their sales taxes on producer prices. \n \n Moreover, Gale (2005) and the Tax Panel (2005) arrived at a higher tax rate because they did not estimate the Fairtax rate, but instead estimated a sales tax of their own design which had a substantially narrower base.",

I say nationalise the oil companies and be done with it.\n\n \n \n First of all, in many places where they've nationalized the oil industry (like in Mexico) they can't even get it out of the ground because they're not able to develop the technology. Also, gas is STILL cheaper here than anywhere else and its the cheapest gallon of liquid you can buy. \n \n Why don't you respond to the fact that the govt. makes 6x the amount off of a gallon of gas than the evil oil companies, or that the convenience stores makes way less than the govt. off the gas? Where is your righteous indignation? And as far as gas riots, you must know different people than I do. The people I see are still buying SUVs and driving to the store just for a $6 gal of milk at the convenience store! I mean, how much have people even adjusted their habits since gas went up? I don't see that many more people car pooling or anything!!! I don't see them taking up arms over the price of gas and if they do it should be directed at the govt. thats bringing in so much more on gas.",

This is more than enough to eliminate all profit for the retailer, and in many cases results in an actual loss of several cents per gallon -- absorbed either through increased pump prices or in other elements of a retailer's business. Retailers with no other sources of profit may go out of business, further restricting ability to deliver gasoline. So don't blame the corner gas station -- even the company-owned ones. The latter may absorb such losses through profits elsewhere in the system, but a loss is still a loss.this from http://www.gravmag.com/oil.html\n \n \n MOre instructive statistics on profit margin as CUNX was so kind to introduce: \n Oil company profits: A perspective\n Earnings, Revenues, Profits (Billions) for selected companies, recent quarter, 2005\n Source: Bloomberg News, reported in AAPG Explorer Dec. 2005 \n Company Net Profit Revenue Profit Margin \n Citigroup (banking) $7.1 $21.5 33% \n Microsoft $3.1 $9.7 32% \n Coca-Cola $1.3 $6.0 21% \n Procter & Gamble $2.0 $14.8 14% \n General Electric $4.7 $41.6 11% \n ExxonMobil $9.9 $92.6 11% \n ConocoPhillips $3.8 $48.7 8% \n IBM $1.5 $21.5 7% \n Chevron $3.6 $51.1 7% \n Wal-Mart $2.8 $76.8 4% \n Oil industry average profit margin is about 8.2%; (3rd Q.

   "By making it illegal to sell oil withing the us for anything above 30$per barrel.\n\n \n Way back in the Romney thread you wrote:\n \n \nThat is why we need more taxes and regulation.\n \n If I controlled the country, my first action would be to pass a law that says if companies want to sell something in the US they must manufacture it in the US. \n Everyone complains about unemployement but doesn't want to do anything about it. We need maufacturing jobs we can't keep taking each others wash in forever.\n\n \n So...You want to increase taxes and regulation (which always raises the price), mandate a fixed cost of unrefined crude oil that results in a net loss for oil companies, AND you want to make sure that the oil sold in the US must COME FROM THE US. By ensuring that the companies costs go up and their profits go down you hope to solve unemployment.\n \n Why not apply the \"Golden Rule\" test to this particular argument. For 1 year, apply this Matthewnomics strategy to your own personal economy. \n 1: Increase the amount of regulation on your personal behavior. (you have been rather vocal about your distaste for current regulations on same).\n 2: Lower your wage by 200%. Refuse to accept any more pay than this, yet increase the amount of payroll tax you pay on your decreased salary. (The parellel to your idea of fixing the profit on a particular product.)\n 3: Refuse to seek employment outside your present company. If your company doesn't want to pay you market value, why should you have the right to seek a more competitive salary elsewhere? (A parellel to your nit-wittery regarding selling a product overseas)\n 4: Refuse to accept part-time work to supplement your income (this would be rather like selling items in a convenience store now wouldn't it?)\n 5: With your decreased salary hire a couple of folks to help you do your present level of work. (the paralell to your idea regarding unemployment)\n By the way Matt:\n \n Regarding Item 5: \n \n Don't forget you have an obligation to pay these folks a \"livable wage\" and ensure that they have complete health care coverage regardless of how much money you are losing. \n \n I look forward to your report of findings on this experiment next March.",

   "What I'm proffering is that money that is now in tax shelters ($13 trillion just in American money, let alone the rest of the world) will be invested in production, thus creating jobs, thus allowing more to be spent, and increasing the tax revenue.\n What makes you think it would? Companies use tax shelters to avoid taxes....not limit production. Switching the tax code in a neutral manner does nothing to increase company production power. There just is no evidence and it doesn't make any sense anyway.\n \n \nI don't know what the average cost taxes add to LABOR costs in the EU, but considering their ultra high taxes, I'd bet my bottom dollar that Taxes in the EU add a ton to not only labor, but production costs in general. If we were to enable them to operate here with no tax burden, I think we'd be seeing some of them come here. And, as stated above, it stands to reason that money now in tax shelters would be put to work if the tax burden was removed.\nIt is tax neutral! There is no decrease in taxes and the tax burden isn't the reason...labor costs is the reason. Taxes are not much of labor costs. Even more so in Europe where you have a lot of VATs and what not. \n \n It doesn't stand to reason that tax shelter money would go into production...it already does. Tax shelters aren't money just stored away some where. \n \n \nBTW, I haven't had time to look into the Ireland stuff, but I've not forgotten. I've been busy trying to finish my book and I'll try to find that stuff soon. Sorry for the delay.\nI've looked a little at their structure and it seems they have a tax burden like many other countries.
