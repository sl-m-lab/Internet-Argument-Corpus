   "I've had enough of these UN blunders! I'm calling for an end to US funding and resolution pushing in the UN. I want their headquarters moved from New York. The UN is nothing more now than a joke. \n \n Around a month ago Libya was up for a chance at the chairmanship of the Human Rights Committee. Yes, I said Libya. Talk about human rights violations... the sad things is that they got a majority of votes and will chair it. Who else is on the committee? The US was kicked off a few years ago, but Serbia is on it. Serbia and Lybia. Those are just two examples. This is idiocy! \n \n Think that's bad? Iraq is going to head the UN Disarmament Conference. Yes, Iraq. Simply absurd. \n \n These are reasons why I don't care what the UN says or wants. This is why I was fine with us not going to the UN on Iraq. They've got 16 resolutions on them, all of which they are not in compliance, and they are leading a conference on the subject. Then we have Libya chairing the Human Rights Committee and Serbia with a seat on it. \n \n Forget the UN. I was ready to get out of it when they kicked us off the Human Rights Committee. We cannot stand by while these idiotic choices are made and a majority votes for them. What has the UN done for us? Got in our way, kicked us off committees for doing what we were supposed to. What have we done for the UN? We fund it, we supply it, we've supported it. That time is over.",

Did Libya invade Grenada? Did Libya drop atomic bombs on Japan? Did Libya use Weapons of Mass Destruction on the nations of Indochina?

Who is responsible for the Morgenthau plan by the way? No country on earth has the same capacity to bomb and murder so many people at will as America. No nation on Earth in the last 50 years has been anywhere near as belligerent as the United States. Adolf Hitler modeled his Eastern Policy upon how America dealt with the natives of North America. No one calls Andrew Jackson a Nazi or Oklahoma a concentration camp now do they?\n \n \nLike I said, idiocy. Leave some space to attack other nations. My gosh.\n\n \n No other nation in the world has such a cavalier attitude about raining down death and destruction upon millions. No other country so flagrently and arrogantly threatens to attack other nations as the United States, who has one standard for every other nation on earth and another standard for itself. America is gearing up for its latest foreign intervention, its latest attempt to create yet another satellite government to its empire.

   "Please list some examples of treaties we have recently violated. And Heydrich, we have come along way since then. You say we are the most aggressive nation in the world. And we are the only nation that has dropped 2 atomic bombs \"in anger\" tell me how many Japenese would have been saved if we had invaded? \n \n The Japanese people were ready to fight to the death against an invasion. \"The Japenese were trying to surrender\" that is absurd!\n Emperor Hirohito (I think that is how it is spelled) had said that Japan was going to have a glorious death like the shattering of a jewel. This does not sound like a defeated person to me. They surrendered becuase they though that we were just going to A-bomb them to death, they did not know that we only had 2. Eisenhower made that quote after the 2nd bomb had been dropped and the Missouri has parked in Tokyo Harbor.\n \n The way I see it, if you hate America and are so ashamed get out!\n No one is holding you back, if you stay you simply admit that America, having its downsides, is the greatest nation on Earth. \n \n If you are not an American and hate us, come and stop us. Until other nations of the world contribute as much as we do they cannot complain. They recieve our aid and then burn our flags, I say to hell with them. I think we should stop aid to all people who hate us and let them fend for themselves. Why is it our job to feed the world? The point is it is not our job, we do it out of kindness so until you pick up your weight, shut up. \n \n The UN is useless without America. If we were to pull out the UN would just be a name with no power. The reason I get mad when Iraq violates a UN treaty is becuase Americans died for that treaty. With every violation Iraq is spitting on the sacrifices made by the service men and women who came before me. Iraq has already violated the cease fire agreement so according to this we already have the right to invade.\n \n If the terrorist are XXXXXX becuase of our policy with Isreal then we should strenghten our bonds with Isreal. We should not budge one inch out of fear from a terrorist. Like I have said before, if they blow up buildings and demand that we cover our women from head to toe and all of our men wear beards should we give into that to?\n NO WE SHOULD NOT THIS IS NOT FRANCE!\n \n The way I see it, if we have to kill everyone in Iraq to save one innocent American life then lets go get to it. I think it would be a good trade. Sorry if that offends you, wait no I'm not. If that offends you, say so (and if you are American or not).\n Good day and\n GOD BLESS AMERICA",

If they see an enemy tank they need to run. If Sadam kidnaps them and puts them at military targets and they die, oh well, they should of know better than to go to Iraq in the first place.

That would be bad as the whole country would probably be engulfed in civil war to claim the throne of Iraq which would probably last, well forever until someone else stepped in and that would lead to far more civillian deaths than our war would. \n \n And back to the main point, the way I see it, if Sadam hides troops near civillian areas and we hit them and civillians including babies get killed (an extremely plausible scenario) then that is not really our fault, it is his for putting them in a civillian area. He is known to use human shields to his advantage so there will unfortunately, certainly be collateral damage. \n \n I am glad to hear that you are for the invasion, and personally I dont think we should stop in Iraq.
