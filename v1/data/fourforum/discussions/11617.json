   "Does anyone wonder why, of all the personal right's our Constitution has afforded to every American as individual's, that the Second Amendment is the first right to be targeted for a complete removal by members of the Government. World history has consistently shown that gun control leads to gun registration, and gun registration leads to gun confiscation, and then gun confiscation lead to the extermination of millions of unarmed people by their own government's. One such exhample of this would be Adolf Hitler, who was responsible for the institution of gun control in Germany, which led to gun registration, and then confiscation, and then a total loss of all their rights and freedoms. Once this was all accomplished, and the people were made defenseless, over twenty million Jews were horribly exterminated. Many of you may foolishly believe that this would never happen in the Uninted States, but be honest with yourself, power has the ability to possibly corrupt anyone, including the leaders we choose every four year's. If we American's, as a society, are disarmed by our Government, we are now defenseless against them, if they become tyrannical. This means a loss of all right's and freedom's for all American's. Would American citizen's then be forced into facilities, or concentration camps if you will, to then be exterminated. I personally see a historical pattern forming, but why do you think the 2nd Amendment has been targeted 1st? Why does the Government really want to disarm it's people? Why would you,as a free American, support giving up any of your right's, weather you exercise that right or not, after all, your rights do belong to you. If you had ten million dollar's, would you give it away just because you are not using it, how would you feel if you were in danger of having it taken from you. This is how good and honest gun owner's feel about our right to own a gun. Remember these quote's next time the gun issue crosses your door- \" Those who would sacrifice Liberty For Security Deserve Neither.\" - Ben Franklin\n \n A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball, and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks. \n \n Thomas Jefferson, lThomas Jefferson, letter to Peter Carr, August 19, 1785\n \n \n To be prepared for war, is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace. \n \n George Washington, First Annual Message, January 8, 1790\n \n \n \"I ask, Sir, what is the militia? It is the whole people. To disarm the people is the best and most effectual way to enslave them.\"\n George Mason\n \n \"And that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the Press, or the rights of Conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms; ...\"\n Samuel Adams\n \n Co-author of the Second Amendment\n during Virginia's Convention to Ratify the Constitution, 1788",

Yes, these are an errosion of our rights, but not a total ban of our rights, at least not yet. But the government must still extend at least respect to an armed populace, that respect being that as long as we have arms we pose a threat to any corrupt aggenda they may have, were as if we become disarmed that respect is gone. I will give you a good exhample, a criminal does not care about your rights or mine, he has no respect for an unarmed person, but he gives respect to a person who is armed. I care about all the rights of the constitution, but in my opinion it is the most important, because the 2nd amendment keeps all the others intact. Should the 2nd ever fall, so will the rest.",

   "Ian, \n \n I am curious as to why you specifically exclude self defense as a valid reason for owning a gun. Data from the FBI shows that victims who resist an aggressor by use of a gun are less likely to be injured than when the use other weapons for defense. I would think that this alone would validate the ownership of a gun for defensive use. On a related note, as was recently confirmed by the SCOTUS, owning a firearm is an individual right. I am not aware of any other right that you are required to to demonstrate a reason prior to exercising.\n \n I don't think you will find too many people that don't think that some form of regulation is needed with regard to guns, the question remains to be what form and how much regulation.\n \n As for resisting our government...Even our government recognizes the damage that a small group can inflict on a military unit. This is why we train soldiers in guerrilla warfare. We just don't call it that in the military. It is usually referred to as special forces, or in the Navy, as Unconventional Warfare Specialists. A small group of accomplished marksman, with a knowledge of military troop movements and structure can be truly devastating to a military unit. Our country has many veterans with just such knowledge, and a even more gun owners that exceed the average soldier in capabilities with a firearm.\n \n There are also a certain number of men and women within the military that would refuse to act on the part of our government in such a case. Everyone in the military understands that they have a duty to their fellow Americans and that any order that conflicts with the laws of the land, is an illegal order. There are still those that would indeed rise against their fellow countrymen, but I think you would find that this action would be less than seamlessly coordinated. This confusion would add to the difficulty of bringing action against the people through military force, but it would not likely be enough to make it impossible.\n \n While an armed populace does not stand a good chance of being victorious in a protracted, all out war with our own government, history has shown that many times in a conflict, the decimation of the enemy is not required to be victorious. Simply having and using the means to resist can be a powerful deterrent and weapon. \n \n The right of the people to keep and bear arms is not about showing a need. The need has already been demonstrated by our government. Throughout our history, the government has demonstrated that they are prone to making blunders that could one day require that the American people use force to tell them \"NO\". How many people were killed or injured by our National Gard during peace protests over the Vietnam war? Remember Ruby Ridge and Waco? How many times have we seen our Government overstep it's boundaries such as after the Katrina Disaster, when law enforcement went gun collecting. There are many such instances in our history that show a need for the people to retain the power to resist a tyrannical government. This nation was founded by men with arms resisting what they considered to be a King that had become a tyrant. I say again, the need has already been established through government action.\n \n JW",

   "...but is gun control not just another erosion? This is the gun control I'm talking about - not an all-out ban, but a valid reason (not self-defence) must be provided in order to purchase a gun.\n\n \n How do you determine what is and isn't a valid reason for gun ownership? What criteria do you go about setting up to make this ultimate determination? Furthermore, how to you ensure that the issuing officer on duty doesn't exercise their authority to deny a request because they feel the reason isn't valid enough? What checks and balances will be in place to keep an abuse of power from happening?\n \n \nAlso, a second question. If gun control will not affect criminal ownership of guns and people will always be able to get a firearm if they want, why should a government make the effort to ban firearms as a precursor to atrocities? After all, the disarmed masses could simply illegally aqwuire arms and then resist...\n\n \n Because by banning guns the government will have an excuse to send out their goon squads to commit door-to-door roundup and confiscation programs. Once guns are outlawed the government would be free to stop you on the street and search you without a warrant to make sure you're not trying to smuggle in weapons, and civil rights would no longer be any obstacle.\n \n \nFinally (for now) - a third. Do you truly believe that if the US government wanted to control it's population, guns would make any difference?\n\n \n Obviously yes, look at the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Also look at how the government has outlawed private individuals from gathering together and training in a military fashion. Obviously they have reason to fear an armed and trained populace.\n \n \nIt might have helped before the days of nukes, planes and APCs, but short of every gun owner being simultaniously organised (and suddenly with a massive supply of ammunition), I can't see much happening...\n\n \n We have some of the best trained soldiers of any organized army, and despite all of our advanced tactics, experience and technology, we're still in the middle east five years later, and having our boys killed off by untrained conscripts, using some weapons that date back to the 1890s.",

   "Well Ian, think about this! All the guns are gone in America, not even criminals can get them anymore. So you get up one morning and decide to drive to a family members home, and on the way you get stopped by the cops, then they tell you that a pass from your government is required to travel now, so you say ok and start to leave when the police tell you to get out of your vehicle, you comply and then ask why you have to exit your vehicle, you are then told all private ownership of automobiles has been banned, the only ones allowed to own autos now is government officials,police, and emergency crews, so you stand there while you watch your car be towed off, gone forever. so you walk home, and when you get home you start to make a phone call, only to find out you have no phone service, so you call for your wife, and inform her of your day and that you have no phone service, she says she already knows about the phone, the government has been going around to all the homes and disconnecting all phone service to all residences, then informing the residents that all forms of private communications have been banned. So you stroll on down to city hall to find out what is going on all the sudden, you are then told that all personal rights and freedoms have been done away with, banned by the government you trusted. So you go back home, eat supper, and go to bed. You are then woke up by the police, not knocking on your door, but standing at your bedside with guns pointed at you, you ask what is going on and they tell you your house is now the property of the government. You and your wife are told to get dressed and then wisked away to a processing center, where you and your wife are told where you will now work and how often you will work, and quitting is not allowed, you are also told where you will now live. You are handed a list of basic laws, those laws are, no freedom of religeon, no freedom of choice as the government will decide thing for you,no freedom of choice as the government will choose things for you, if you become ill you must go to a government appointed health center for treatment, all transportation is now public, and no travelling is allowed without a permit.You are not allowed to have children without a permit anymore. So you and your wife get settled in to your new dwellings, and after a while decide to get a permit to have a child so you apply for it, only to be told you must give a justifiable reason for wanting to have a child, and just because you want to have children is not considered justifiable. All this is a glimpse of what could happen if we allow our government to disarm us, it might not happen, but it could, and thats the point. As far as how could we fight back with any hopes of victory, when comparing our firepower to that of the government? All one has to do is look as history, every countries weapons and technology have been funneled to its enemies by people who believe that war should be fought on even ground. Someone with the ability to get us citizens military grade weapons in order to fight a tyrannical government, would make sure we had them, plus an armed populace with one uniformed goal, and consisting of millions of people, strength in numbers has never changed. A heard of african elephants, with all their size and might, flees from the millions of oncoming army ants. Just something to think about.",
