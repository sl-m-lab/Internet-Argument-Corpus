   "**\n \n FYI--\n \n \"Date: April 2, 2007 \n More on: Bacteria, Microbes and More, Microbiology, Extreme Survival, Developmental Biology, Genetics \n \n Bacteria Communication: Counting Heads or Measuring Space?\n Science Daily - Bacteria can \"talk\" to each other: by using signal substances they inform their neighbours as to whether or not it is worth switching certain genes on or off. This communication between bacterial cells is essential for the adaptation to changing environments and for the survival. What exactly do bacteria learn from the signal substances? \n \n There have been two theories: the release of signal substances is understood to be either a cooperative strategy to determine the cell density (quorum sensing) or - alternatively - a non-cooperative strategy in which the signal substance is only used to determine the dimensions of the space surrounding the cell (diffusion sensing). However, both theories have not been shown to work under natural conditions, which usually are much more complex than those in laboratory. \n \n Scientists from the GSF - National Research Center for Environment and Health (member of the Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft) have been able to show that both approaches are merely theoretical extremes of an overall strategy by which bacteria determine whether the amount of energy required to produce substances, such as antibiotics or exoenzymes, is worth while in a particular environmental situation. \"This overall strategy - called efficiency sensing - combines existing theories and first allows an understanding of how bacterial communication works and which purpose it serves\", explains Dr. Burkhard Hense from the GSF Institute of Biomathematics and Biometry (IBB), who analysed the various strategies using mathematical models. \n \n Microbial communication was first discovered in mixed liquid laboratory cultures, e.g. of the luminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri, which only shows bioluminescence from a certain cell density. Therefore, the release of signal molecules was first understood as a strategy to determine the cell density (quorum sensing). \n \n With its cooperative approach, however, quorum sensing does not provide a stable survival strategy from an evolutionary point of view, because \u0084cheaters\" can also benefit from the released substances without having to pay for their production. The approach of diffusion sensing is slightly simpler: it is assumed that the bacterium uses the signal substances to measure whether the cell sourrounding space is adequate to achieve the concentration of active substances required for efficient action. This is in contrast to the quorum sensing concept, when other bacteria do not necessarily have to be involved. \n \n In a more complex and heterogeneous environment, such as the root compartment of plants, however, both communication strategies have their weaknesses: the root surface is a highly complex matrix in which solids, gels, liquids and gases are found within a small space and where numerous other organisms interfere with the communication on top of that. Therefore, within the framework of the interdisciplinary project \"Molecular Interactions in the Rhizosphere\" Hense and his colleagues of the GSF-Institute of Biomathematics and Biometry (IBB) investigated this habitat in cooperation with Professor Dr. Anton Hartmann and Dr. Michael Rothballer from the GSF Department Microbe-Plant-Interaction ( AMP). \n \n Based on experimental observations, it could be shown by mathematical modelling that the spatial distribution of the bacteria in the rhizosphere often has a stronger influence on the communication than the cell density or the dimensions of the space surrounding them. Therefore, the scientists developed a synthesis of the two models, which they named \"efficiency sensing\": the microbes always perceive a mixture of cell density, cell distribution and diffusion limitation due to spatial conditions, because these aspects cannot be strictly separated - it depends on the circumstances and habitat quality which aspect is predominant. \n \n The problem of the \"cheaters\" is also avoided, if the spatial distribution of the cells is taken into consideration: on root surfaces or in biofilms related organisms often form clonal micro-colonies. Since in this case all relatives are in the immediate proximity, they are also most likely to encounter the signal substances and the reactions triggered by the signal substances - strangers are largely excluded. Thus, such aggregations of closely related cells allow stable cooperation in terms of evolution and offer effective protection from external interference. \n \n \"Efficiency sensing was developed based on observations and models of the conditions on root surfaces, but it can be transferred to other bacterial habitats\", Hense emphasizes. Therefore, manipulations of the bacterial signal system are a highly promising approach in various spheres of life, e.g. in agriculture (support of plant-growth-promoting bacteria, inhibition of noxious organisms) or in medicine (fighting pathogens). A better understanding of the ecological mechanisms of bacterial signaling under natural conditions, as is possible with the \"efficiency sensing\" concept, is a prerequisite for this. \n \n Note: This story has been adapted from a news release issued by GSF - National Research Center for Environment and Health.\"\n \n **\n at--\n http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070402103058.htm",

Here's one--intelligence is an inherent ability or capacity to aquire data, process the data into meaningful information, store that information, retrieve that information when stimulated to do so, and to use that retrieved information in order to intentionally or habitually instigate or alter behaviour. I just made that up on the spot, so feel free to argue against it.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by ShadowPikachu \n And what, exactly is \"it\" that \"Darwinists\" got wrong? \n \n \n I also wonder this.\n\n \n **\n Put simply, what darwinists and all other materialists 'got [fundamentally]wrong' is the notion that dynamic biosystems, aka living organisms, are not basically [qualitatively] different from any other non-dynamic, i.e., strictly mechanical, systems,-- such as storm systems, solar systems, and so forth.\n \n The darwinian/materialist notion that all matter is passive and out of its own control in any way, and can do nothing but passively react to the physical mechanics of external forces acting upon it, is exactly the same for a living cell as it is for a bit of sand or a bubbling brook. All of their subsequent errors, such as RM+NS, derive from this false metaphysical postulate.\n \n \n\n Since I see things from a ToE side of view\n\n \n **\n Since \"ToE\" means \"RM+NS\", why can you just be honest and say \"the darwinist\" or \"the materialist\" or \"the mechanist\" POV? And don't try the old 'there's so much more to the \"ToE\" than RMNS, because only the parts of evolutionary biology that reduce to RM or NS, or some combo of RM and NS, belong to darwinism. All the modern evolutionary biology, ie, post \"The Modern Synthesis\" points to a dynamic view, an Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis, dynamic, volitional, intelligence-based, self-operated, responsive, \"self-taught\" view of organismic evolution. As opposed to the darwinist, 'accidental [random], selective, passive, mechanical, determinist', view.\n \n \n\n I do have an ID question...Is ID possible without religion, and more specifically the bible.\n\n \n **\n Certainly. Not only is it possible, it necessarily must be. Sadly, for political and ideological reasons, both darwinists and creationists have insisted that ID is synonymous with cretionism, and that falsehood is now so generally accepted that it is impossible to repair the damage done to the term, \"Intelligent Design\". For my purely secular, but non-darwinian, explanation for the fact of evolution, I use Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis, EAM for short, in place of \"ID\", simply because that term has been ruined by the darwinists,[those people who worship \"Lady Luck\"] and the creationists [those people who worship an old book].\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n **\n Silly thinking.

The problem with ID is that it isnt very rational, and is completely unproovable.\n\n \n **\n Only if you do as most do now, and equate ID with creationism, as if they were the very same thing.

From the way you speak, you have absolutely no place being in a lab of any kind, let alone working on cellular and molecular biology. Secondly you through a cute little statement in this paragraph--I believe)-- Well at least you didn't include professor Buehler in your ignorance here. I find it completely funny not to mention you will not be able to site any source that states \"that all living cells are intelligent.\" There is no doubt that there are single celled organisms that do exhibit intelligence, but to go on to say that all cells are intelligent is loopy, not to mention something a second grader might say. There is absolutely no proof to this, besides what you make up in your funny little mind. Your own source quotes the required organelles for intellegence, of which many cells do not have.\n \n This is from your own source--\n Nucleus. From the point of view of the 'intelligent cell' the nucleus is the main library. It contains the blueprints and instructions that have evolved over one billion years of evolution, which tell the cell how to operate, how to rebuild itself (including its 'nerves' and 'brain') after every cell division, and how to act and interact with other cells as they build and maintain an organism.\n \n Also take a gander at this, also from your source.--\n An operational definition of the intelligent cell.\n First a disclaimer. My work did not intend to join the ongoing efforts of philosophers, logicians and computer scientists to find a universal definition of intelligence. On the contrary, it did not question the common assumption that everybody can tell a mindless, mechanical gadget from an intelligent machine, and proceeded to ask which of the two categories apply to a living cell. Clearly, there are many different levels of intelligence, but I believe that most people consider a machine mechanical and mindless if its actions either do not seem to respond to signals or else always show an immutable set of reactions. On the other hand, we expect an intelligent machine to responds to signals in a large variety of ways, especially if the signals are unforeseeable, and if its responses offer solutions to problems, which were transmitted by the signals. Usually, this means that the intelligent machine contains at least 2 different machines, one which it mindless and carries out some mechanical labor while the other collects and processes signals and controls the action of the first. Therefore, we may use the following operational definition of an intelligent cell. An intelligent cell contains a compartment, which is capable of collecting and integrating a variety of physically different and unforeseeable signals as the basis of problem-solving decisions. \n Are there reasons to think that cells are intelligent?\n The prevailing wisdom of modern biology has it that cells are immensely complex, but rigidly operating chemical machines that derive their operating instructions internally from their genes and externally from chemicals and electrical signals emitted rigidly by other cells. Unable to believe that any machine can be designed that contains an instruction library which anticipates all the mishaps and glitches of a billion years of evolution without crashing over and over again, I began almost three decades ago to search for signs that the cell was actually a 'smart' machine. In other words, I looked for experimental evidence that cells contained a signal integration system that allowed them to sense, weigh and process huge numbers of signals from outside and inside their bodies and to make decisions on their own. \n \n These statements tell us a couple of things;\n A) Not all cell are intelligent, as evident by defining what makes a cell intelligent. If all cells were intelligent there would be no need to define which one are and which are not....duh\n B) This is all from a hypotheisis of this professor, and yes it is some very intersting work as of yet there have been only results, and no conclusions. Professor has been working on this for thiry years now, the least you can do is let him finish before deciding if he is correct or not.\n \n Also just to let you know Dr. Buehler does not believe in ID.\n \n 2) You are incorrect, according to your own source, only the cells with the specific \"compatments\" show intelligence.\n \n 3) Are you implying that only all organic cells are intelligent? As I stated before, and am sure I will need to again, because your not that quick. Dr. Buehler stated the reqirement for specific \"compartment\" for intellegence. A RBC does not have these...ooops there goes your point. Why do you keep stating what the good doctor has to say, if you know him so well, I suggest you bring him on here and let him speak for himself. Also I don't live that far from Evanston, and would happy to meat with the man if you wanted to set it up...since your good friends and all.\n \n 5) This not only is the funniest thing you have said yet, but is directly apposed by your own source, and I will quote it again for you. \"I believe that most people consider a machine mechanical and mindless if its actions either do not seem to respond to signals or else always show an immutable set of reactions. \"\n \n \n Now its your turn good luck",

Obviously RBC's do have such control, or they could not function. And so do prokaryotes. That simply means that where that capacity is, or may be, situated in the nucleus of eukaryotes, it is located somewhere else in prokaryotes and RBC's. Personally I am inclined to believe, contra Buehler, that in prokaryotes there need not be such a specialized compartmentalization--no more than plants need brains in order to be intelligent organisms.\n \n \n\n Why do you keep stating what the good doctor has to say, if you know him so well, I suggest you bring him on here and let him speak for himself.\n\n \n **\n Please try writing one sentence at a time, and maybe you'll eventually learn how to write one properly.\n Re Buehler, all I've done is supply the link--you're the one who keeps on quoting and misinterpreting him. I'm not the man's acolyte; my ideas formed long before I ever heard of him, and, as above, I am not in total agreement with him on all points. But on the essential--that intelligence is a property of all living things, including organic cells, we completely agree.And although you persist in saying that that is not true, you have quoted nothing from Buehler that supports your opinion. However, if you ever do find a quote in which Buehler supports your opinion of his ideas, i.e., that some cells are intelligent but others are not, then he and I will disagree on that point, and that's all.\n \n \n\n Also I don't live that far from Evanston, and would happy to meat with the man if you wanted to set it up...since your good friends and all.\n\n \n **\n In what crazy world does a link supplied to a thread imply that the poster and the subject of the link even know each other, let alone are pals?!? You better start re-taking your meds.

Please exapnd upon your exigesis.\n\n \n **\n Read what Shannon wrote. He obviously uses (obvious to anyone familiar with the English language, its denotations and connotations) the word \"information\" where he should use 'datum' or 'data', and \"communication\" where he should use data \"transfer\" or \"transportation\". He also made another horrible mistake when he misapplied the thermodynamic term \"entropy\" to the process of turning data into information. Thermodynamic entropy only applies to physical, mechanical systems. It just confuses things when you extend that meaning from the data processing machines and physical media used in data transfer and transportation to the actual non-physical process of generating significance/implication/inference/meaning/information out of data/fact/symbol/sign/form correlations. Its like extending the entropy involved in the process of printing and selling a newspaper to the process of reading it. It's just plain wrong. Stupidly wrong.",
