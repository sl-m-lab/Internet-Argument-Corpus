   "What good is the UN doing for us? Their headquarters is in New York and they rack up parking tickets and never have to pay them (millions of dollars). We currently provide about 22% of their funding every year. And what do we get in return? Well Kofi continues to defy our ambitions to remove Saddam and even recommend that we not go into Fallujah. They also want to postpone elections in Iraq. On top of it all, the UN was working behind the scenes illegally with Saddam. They helped him stay in power when their objective was to force him to comply with their sanctions. However, they knowingly allowed him to defy these resolutions and even helped him gain wealth while at the same time putting his citizens in worse poverty. The money he got illegally from the UN was even used to pay the families of Palestinian suicide bombers!! Kofi's son was even being paid by one of the UN contractor's over $125,000 over the 5 years the oil-for-food program went on.\n \n With out intentions of rooting out terrorism and making our country and the world safer, can we trust the UN? Or better yet, can we trust Kofi? How has he not been fired/impeached? He aided terrorism, he bribed and received illegal funds, etc and nothing is being done about it. Many members of the UN wanted a no confidence vote against him!!",

   "Corruption like that is abhorrent. It should never happen.\n \n BUT, the UN shouldn't be disbanded, only remodeled. One problem is the fact that with the structure of the Security Council, the peace-enforcment arm of the UN, it is fairly ineffectual when it comes to actually administering justice and enforcing peace.\n \n There are 5 permanent members, all of whom have veto power. So how many Security Council resolutions do you think are passed on these countries? None, of course. So, basically, it's these 5 countries running the real show when and where it counts. \n \n So, for the most part, the UN is a stick that a lot of countries can pick up and use, but only within the permission of certain more powerful countries.\n \n So, if we kick the UN out of New York and give up our membership, we'd lose veto power and other members of the Security Council would start finding reasons to pass resolutions against us. That might start some fights that we don't want.\n \n Or do you just want the meeting place moved to free up traffic and parking?",

The US helped Saddam remain in power until he stopped serving our needs and started serving his own. The reason most of the world did not want Saddam overthrown is because they forsaw the very situation we are in now. Even if the oil for food thing wasn't there, the UN would still have these reasons to keep him in power. he was a thug, but at least he was holding the country together. Now, it seems to be falling apart at the seams.\n \n Kofi's gotta go, and I've seen a few things on the news that suggest people will push for his replacement. His term ends in 2006, but look who'd eyeing the job :)\n http://www.synthstuff.com/mt/archives/individual/2004/10/a_replacement_for_kofi_annan.html\n :)",
