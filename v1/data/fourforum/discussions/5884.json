   "Now not being a homosexual myself, I may lose some transition in what I am trying to say, so for that I am sorry. I was writing a paper today on sexual orientation and realized some questions came up and I am actually curious what other people think. Do you think sexual orientation is biological or environmental? Now if it's biological that would mean that in a way, genetics would have something to do with who we are sexually just as well as we are left or right handed. Now I understand that some may argue that it is choice whether you are gay or not, but is it really? For people who are, could you see yourself thinking that your straight? The answer is probably no, just as us who are straight could not think of ourselves as gay. Now people who are bi are a different matter, but still within the same realm because they hold a little bit of both genetics. If you would like to move this into religion as well, as some have done... Maybe some passages were mis-interperated (excuse my spelling if it is wrong), because as you all know, nobody in a very long time has seen the original bible, it has been rewrote a million different times and in many different ways. What if certain passages were changed purposly because the translators didn't like what they saw? But then again, maybe nothing except little things here and there were changed. Also, if it was proven that being homosexual was biological, then what? Could they really have laws against it? It would be the same as it being illigal for me to be left handed (which by the way was looked down on for a long time and people were forced to write right handed who were in fact left handed) or have bad eyesight. But then again in a country who kills innocent people and reduces sentences for pedifiles and rapists, I guess I shouldn't expect any less.",
