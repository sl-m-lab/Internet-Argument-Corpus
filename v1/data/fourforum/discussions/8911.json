   "Part of our problem is that the party out of power wants to impeach the president no matter who he is. I was against impreaching Bill Clinton. To even think of impeaching George Bush is absurd. \n \n No, we are not better off than we were 6 years ago, but we are better off than we would be if Gore or Kerry were president. Bush has risen to the occasion. He has worked tirelessly to keep America safe since 9/11. \n \n This is not Vietnam. All this has happened as a result of 9/11. Muslim fanatics aimed to destroy the heart and soul of America: our economic interests in the Twin Towers and our military strength at the Pentagon. The downed plane was to take out our Capitol and center of government. \n \n Nor is this Vietnam in that no one is being drafted off the streets and forced into combat against his will. The men in Iraq are volunteers, professional soldiers. For my part, if any one of them can not handle the stress, bring him home. We do not need suicides. \n \n Iran is the problem now. I perused the interview Ahmadinejad gave to Time Magazine. Ahmadinejad's world view hinges on his hatred for the United States and Israel. He denies the Nazi holocaust against the Jews in World War II and says that Israel should be \"wiped off the map.\" He resents the U.S. being a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council when, in fact, the U.N. owes its existence to the United States. \n \n Iran is developing nuclear plants. Nuclear energy is a wonderful thing when used for peaceful purposes. Every country which has developed nuclear energy also has the atomic bomb. Iran would be no exception. But it might be the one likely to use it or make it available to terrorist groups. We can not trust the fanatic fringe. If the hijackers had nuclear weapons on 9/11, there would be no New York City and no Washington, DC today. George Bush has looked them in the eye and warned them it will not happen on his watch. Let's support our president. \n \n U.S. PRESIDENTS http://jimcolyer.com/papers/entry?id=50",

   "hmmmmm sounds fun. I love the toddler mind.\n\n \n \n First, I find it vaugly disturbign that you would want to pretend to be the mother of my children for long periods of time. Simone I could understand, since she was in love with me. I am starting to get a little concerned about the number of potential kidnappers/stalkers running around here. I know I am pretty irresistable (especially the receding hairline....chicks dig receding hairlines), but I am taken so you will all just have to cope :) \n \n Second, if you have anythign of value, or electronic, and especially anything that covers both, you do NOT want my son running around, ESPECIALLY with a screwdriver. I have a lot of hobbies, most of which involve building things. My kids have always likes to sit and watch me work on stuff. When somethign is broken, my daughter brings it to me and says \"daddy, can you fix this??\" When my son breaks something, he brings it to me and wants me to give him some tools. My assistance is apparently not required...he will \"fix\" it himself. \n \n So far THIS WEEK, he has taken the case off of my wifes computer and scragged the hard drive by unplugging it while running, destroyed one space heater, one keyboard (oured water in it), and taken the freakign ball out of my trackball and apparently made it vanish from the planet. \n \n He has screwdrivers stashed all over the house in hiding places becuase he knows he is not supposed to have them. If it has screws, he feels compelled to remove them, disassemble the item, and see what is inside that e might like to have. \n \n Also this week,we were showing my daughter how to ride bareback. Kids always freak out the first time they ride bareback. You put them up there and let them scream until you take about 10 steps and by then they have figured out it is OK. Put my daughter up there (she is 4...and YES...somebody was leading the horse). She started screaming, so my wifes mom started leading the horse off. From behind me I hear the 2 yr old scream NOOOOOO. I turn around just in time to see him come barreling around the side of the barn with a golf club and lay into that horse...jabbering the whole time. I dopn't know how much you know about horses, but they apparently HATE being beat with golf clubs. That horse started bucking and trying to kick the little guy. I jumped between the horse and the kid, gabbed him and tossed him. Got the XXXX kicked out of me. Got the daughter off the still bucking horse...got the XXXX kicked out of me some more. \n \n \n The boy is still off to the side screaming at that horse and wagging his finger at it (my wife is a finger wagger). THe horse is terrorized. My daughter is terrorized. I have 4 broken ribs and am terrorized. The worst part was that I had no idea what to do about the kid. On the one hand, I felt like I should yell at him becuase hitting horses with golf clubs is a bad thing to do. On the other hand, I was kind of proud of him, because it takes a lot of courage for a kid who is 2 and a half feet tall to attack an 800 lb horse with a stick becuase he thinks his sister is being hurt. I ended up just telling my wife \"you handle this\" and going on up to the house. I'm still not sure what she did about it.\n \n yep. Thats typical behavior for The Destroyer.",

A lot of people have trouble grasping that a 2 yr old does not CARE about what you want. They do not particularly CARE if their actions make you happy or not. If they want to watch spongebob for 15 horus straight, then by god you had better get in line and do as your emporer tells you. \n \n \nYou say this is supposed to be figured out by three? Oh dear.

I have a sister who is 28 that is the same....and another one that is 32 that is just now learnign that she is not the center of the universe (nothing smacks you in the face with \"the world does not revolve around YOU\" like having a baby)\n \n \nDaewoo - your kid sounds like a hoot. However - may I recommend a mouse with the laser point rather than a track ball?\n\n \n Then the whole mouse dissapears. I have a system now. When I get up from the desk, I lock the ball up in a drawer (the same drawer that I keep my little screwdrivers locked in).
