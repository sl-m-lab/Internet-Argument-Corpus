   "I read this entire thread, not one fact given, just all the big brains lamenting how the dim-witted could believe in Dinos and man alive at once.\n Yes I do believe it, I take the creation record as fact.\n\n \n \n \n \n Walking-fish:\n So you want facts that refute the notion that humans & dinos walked the Earth together? I'll try to contain my laughter and explain the evidence. First of all, the onus is really on creationists to come up with evidence for the coexistence of Adam & Eve with T rex. The Paluxy tracks and some finding of a boot burried in cretaceous rock don't pass muster against the fossil record.\n \n The real problem for evolutionists is knowing where to start and which of the thousands of facts to mention first. We have several major methods of radiometric dating (K/Ar - U/Pb - Rb/Sr) and dozens of minor methods, all of which concur to put the KT boundary (btw Cretaceous & Tertiary periods) at @ 65 million years ago. No modern mammals before the KT...No dinosaurs after the KT... You can always yammer about innacurate dates due to contamination or alleged changes in the rates of decay, BUT how do you explain the CONCURANCE of so many different methods on such a consistent basis?\n \n Another fact refuting the coexistence of humans & dinos involves the lineages of both the mammalian & reptilian classes. There is a whole line of synapsid reptiles becoming more & more mammal-like throughout the Mesozoic Era, 'til they cross the threshold. This process is so gradual that you can't draw an exact line in the sand to show where the reptiles become mammals. Teeth gradually become differentiated, the 2ndary palate becomes more prominent, the reptilian jaw decreases in importance while the new mammalian jaw is established etc... Finally, the tertiary period brings a whole new array of more modern-looking mammals and primates evolve from prosimians to monkeys (@ 40 million years ago) and these give rise to apes (@ 20 million years ago) and finally, the hominid line is seen in the record dating back to @ 4 million years ago. This is all removed from the dinosaurs, the last of which are seen 65 million years ago. \n \n This is , admittedly, a sketchy overview, but the facts are so obvious that it seems ridiculous to even have to mention this much. Now the burden of proof is upon you (Bgdawg) to show evidence for humans dating more than 65 million years ago or else dinos dating less than 4 million years ago... YABA DABA DOO!!",

They can't name the SPECIFIC HOMINID man allegedly evolved from, nor can they present any conclusive genetic DNA evidence to back it up.\n\n \n \n \n \n Walking-fish:\n All well accepted theories in science involve INFERENCE. Relativity theory involves inferences about the passage of time relative to the velocity of an object. Atomic theory involves inferences about quantum levels, atomic number and chemical properties derived from these inferences about atomic structure. Likewise, the fossil record includes enough transitional forms to allow paleontologists to infer the basic outlines of lineages. It is obvious that the hominid line leading to Homo sapiens involved a species of Australopithecine, Homo habilis & Homo erectus. Why do you demand that the exact species of Autralopithecine be known? That's like expecting chemists to know ahead of time how every compound will react in every specific circumstance in order to show that the laws of chemisrty really work.\n \n There is already enough evidence from genetics to establish a common ancestry between humans & chimps, including: 96% concilience between the two genomes / identical ERVs (Endogenous Retro-Viruses) in the genomes of both species / the same inactivated GULO gene for vitamin C synthesis / a single pair of human chromosomes showing evidence that they were derived from two pair of ape chromosomes attached end-to-end at the telomeres.\n \n You must realize that the main evidence for evolution & common ancestry comes from genetics, comparative anatomy, embryogenesis, biogeography and population studies. The fossil record is NOT, and never has been, the main source of evidence for evolution itself. It only serves to chronicle the historical record. And, amazingly, it concurs beautifully with the rest of the evidence. BTW, between the fossil record of hominids & the genetic evidence, it is evident that humans & chimps shared a common ancestor @ 5 to 6 million years ago.",

   "Last time I checked evolutionists could only advance their famous inference that man evolved from another hominid. They can't name the SPECIFIC HOMINID man allegedly evolved from, nor can they present any conclusive genetic DNA evidence to back it up.\n\n \n One common question asked by creationists trying to pick holes in evolutionary theory is: \"Where are all the transitional fossils?\"\n \n They want to know where is the half-man/half-monkey, where is the half reptile/half mammal, where is the half fish/half amphibian etc etc.\n \n The problem with this question is that it, like many other similar questions, does not actually take into account the way that evolutionary theory describes the formation of new species.\n \n New species appear as the result of tens of thousands of small changes to successive generations of animals over a very very long time, in fact every generation is different from the last, in millions of tiny ways.\n Only a few members of each generation will still have surviving ancestors hundreds of generations down the line, so one small change can lock a species into a series of evolutionary steps which results in a totally new creature descended from one family of slightly divergent ancestors.\n \n The upshot of all this is that every fossil is in fact a transitional fossil. Fossils are very rare finds, for reasons that I mentioned in another post:\n \n \n\n * We have already listed one bias - soft bodied organisms are rarely preserved.\n *Only organisms living in areas of active deposition will be preserved. Erosional or non-depositional environments are not accounted for. Terrestrial environments are usually erosional and thus poorly preserved. Marine environments are preserved much more frequently.\n * Rocks deposited in deep sea environments are eventually destroyed by subduction. Rocks deposited on continental shelves are destroyed by metamorphism during continental collisions. Sediments with the highest degree of survivability over the long term are those deposited in depositional basins on continental interiors.\n * The vast majority of paleontologists have lived and worked in North American and Europe.\n So, our knowledge of the history of life is heavily biased toward marine, hard shelled fossils from marine, cratonic sediments of North America and Europe. These biases must be taken into consideration when studying patterns in the history of life on earth.\"\n -http://people.hofstra.edu/faculty/J_B_Bennington/137notes/taphonomy.html \n\n \n So creationists ask evolutionists to produce all the fossils to show all the links between the ones they've already found. When this proves impossible, the creationists say \"Aha! I have proved you wrong!\". \n Even if we did have a complete, generation-by-generation, fossil record we could take any fossil from it and see that it was only transitional between the almost identical creature that came before it and the almost identical one that came after it. This is the nature of evolution.\n \n \n I am interested in your proof as to why it could not have occured.\n\n As with anything else, it is impossible to provide proof that something has definitley not happened. Can anyone prove that pink unicorns do not exist?\n However, there is a great deal of evidence that supports the central tenets of evolutionary theory, including the fact that all the data we have collated shows that dinosaurs and man existed in very different ages. While this does not disprove the creationist theory, it certainly does not support it. \n \n Yes I do believe it, I take the creation record as fact.\n\n What creation record? Where is all the geological, astrological and paleontological evidence that supports the Genesis account?",

Since you didn't specify which missing link (between crossopterygian fish & Ichthyostegids / between cynodonts & early mammals / between old world monkeys & apes / between apes & the hominid line) I must INFER that you think there is ONE link between ape & hominid with no gradations. In other words, you don't understand that there is any number of transitions in a lineage, not to mention all the side branches. BUT you want me to name THE missing link. I INFER that you think that the inability to identify ONE such link is supposed to be an argument against evolution and for creation. Never mind that there has never been any evidence for Intelligent Design or Special Creation.\n \n You didn't get the argument I was making about the absurdity of expecting a theory to have data on every specific circumstance. Are you goiing to contest atomic theory because it is inadequate for predicting the exact result of every conceivable chemical reaction? Is atomic theory a weak theory in chemistry because chemists can't discover new products simply by working out the theoretical reactions on paper without having to experiment in the lab?\n \n It is telling how you cherry picked the factoid about 96% concilience between human & chimp genomes while you ignored the 3 other pieces of genetic evidence (inactive GULO gene / identical ERVs / evidence for 2 ape chromosomes combining to form one human chromosome). You want genetic evidence for a specific Australopithecine specimen as a \"missing link\". Even if that were forth coming, you'd then want genetic evidence for the link before that specimen. If a common ancestor were found between chimp & human, you would then want to see a whole lineage from that species leading to modern chimps as well as one leading to humans. And if both lineages were filled in completely, you would look at each link in the chain and complain that it was just a variation of the link next to it, while you look at two specimens further removed from eachother and say they can't be related because they are \"different kinds\". In other words, you are fitting into the predictable pattern of CREATIONIST DENIAL. I can INFER all this because I have seen creationists play this game many times before, and I'm sure others have encountered that ploy on this forum.\n \n Now I have a question for you.
