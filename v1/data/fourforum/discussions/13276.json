   "This is a response to Art Pigou's comments to a thread that seems to have fallen off. Seems I took a little to long to get around to this but better late than never\n \n I combined some of your responses that pertained to the same subject and then answered the combination. There was a lot to respond to so this is very long, but covers everything you brought up.\n \nI'm going to ignore the semantic pedantry and ask a series of direct questions, and I hope I receive direct answers. You said that for Paul, the resurrection is not physical. Why? Does \"not physical\" mean \"the resurrection body is not made of flesh and blood\"? \n\n \n The resurrected body will not be flesh and blood because that is what Paul says, but I will take it a step further and suggest that the resurrected body will in its natural state, be spiritual. \n \n \nAre there not other physical things a body could be made out of, particularly in the ancient mind?\n\n Yes, a body could be made of many different physical things. The modern mind has created a number of different materials to make bodies and body parts, but that fact doesn't help you. The Christian position is not the resurrected body is, was or will be made of any one or combination of those many other physical things, but that Jesus was raised in the same body he died in. \n I am suggesting it is spiritual, which is the only other biblically based option.\n As to the ancient mind possessing the ability to believe a body could be made of a wide variety of materials is best case creative, worst ignorant, middle being gullible and typically doesn't make for good evidence.\n \nPaul is alluding to the Exod narrative. The \"spiritual food\" is the quail and bread. The \"spiritual drink\" is water, and the \"spiritual rock\" is that from which the water folowed.\n \n Now, what does this mean, pappillion? \n It means that for Paul, use of the adjective &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; does not mean the noun it modified is non-physical. \n Quail is physical, right? Bread is physical? \n It means that for Paul, use of the adjective &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; does not imply the noun it modified is made of spirit. \n It is spiritual in that it is god-given.\n \n Get it, pappillion? If the adjective &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; does not imply non-physicality or composition out of spirit, why would this mean the &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; post-resurrection body be non-physical and/or made out of spirit?\n\n Following is the definition of spiritual from a dictionary and it's uses in the bible from and encyclopedia as well as commentary on 1 Cor 10:3-4. Please read with the intention of understanding. \n 1) Relating to the human spirit, or rational soul, as part of the man which is akin to God and serves as his instrument or organ\n a) That which possesses the nature of the rational soul\n 2) Belonging to a spirit, or a being higher than man but inferior to God\n 3) Belonging to the Divine Spirit\n a) Of God the Holy Spirit\n b) One who is filled with and governed by the Spirit of God\n 4) Pertaining to the wind or breath; windy, exposed to the wind, blowing\n Spiritual: Adjective Strong's Number: G4152 Greek: pneumatikos\n \"Always connotes the ideas of invisibility and of power. It does not occur in the Sept. nor in the Gospels; it is in fact an after-Pentecost word. In the NT it is used as follows: \n (a) The angelic hosts, lower than God but higher in the scale of being than man in his natural state, are 'spiritual hosts,' Eph 6:12; \n (b) Things that have their origin with God, and which, therefore, are in harmony with His character, as His law is, are 'spiritual,' Rom 7:14; \n (c) 'spiritual' is prefixed to the material type in order to indicate that what the type sets forth, not the type itself, is intended, 1Cr 10:3, 4; \n (d) the purposes of God revealed in the gospel by the Holy Spirit, 1Cr 2:13, and the words in which that revelation is expressed, are 'spiritual,' 1Cr 2:13, matching, or combining, spiritual things with spiritual words [or, alternatively, 'interpreting spiritual things to spiritual men,' see (e) below]; 'spiritual songs' are songs of which the burden is the things revealed by the Spirit, Eph 5:19; Col 3:16; 'spiritual wisdom and understanding' is wisdom in, and understanding of, those things, Col 1:9; \n (e) men in Christ who walk so as to please God are 'spiritual,' Gal 6:1; 1Cr 2:13 [but see (d) above], 1Cr 2:15; 3:1; 14:37; \n (g) the blessings that accrue to regenerate men at this present time are called 'spiritualities,' Rom 15:27; 1Cr 9:11; 'spiritual blessings,' Eph 1:3; 'spiritual gifts,' Rom 1:11; \n (h) the activities Godward of regenerate men are 'spiritual sacrifices,' 1Pe 2:5; their appointed activities in the churches are also called 'spiritual gifts,' lit., 'spiritualities,' 1Cr 12:1; 14:1; \n (i) The resurrection body of the dead in Christ is 'spiritual,' i.e., such as is suited to the heavenly environment, 1Cr 15:44; \n \n Matthew Henry (Read 1 Corinthians 10:1-5)\n To dissuade the Corinthians from communion with idolaters, and security in any sinful course, the apostle sets before them the example of the Jewish nation of old. They were, by a miracle, led through the Red Sea, where the pursuing Egyptians were drowned. It was to them a typical baptism. The manna on which they fed was a type of Christ crucified, the Bread which came down from heaven, which whoso eateth shall live forever. Christ is the Rock on which the Christian church is built; and of the streams that issue there from, all believers drink, and are refreshed. It typified the sacred influences of the Holy Spirit, as given to believers through Christ. But let none presume upon their great privileges, or profession of the truth; these will not secure heavenly happiness.\n \n Verse 3\n and did all eat the same spiritual food.\n Just as Israel's commitment \"unto Moses\" by their passage through the sea corresponded to the Christian's baptism, their being fed with \"spiritual food,\" that is, food of supernatural origin, as in the manna, and the water from the rock, corresponded to the Christian's eating the flesh of Christ and drinking his blood in the manner of John 6:54-58. John Wesley said that this spiritual food was \"typical of the bread which we eat at Christ's table.\" F8 Dummelow noted that \"Only here in the New Testament are the two Sacraments mentioned side by side,\" F9 giving three reasons why the term \"spiritual food\" was used in this verse: (1) it was miraculous; (2) it was typical; and (3) it assured them of God's presence. \n \n Verse 4\n and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them; and the rock was Christ.\n Rock that followed them ...\n This is not to be understood as Paul's reference to the Jewish legend about a literal rock that followed the Israelites in their wanderings. The rock to which Paul referred here was clearly stated: \"The rock was Christ.\" The miracle of Moses' bringing forth water from the rock in the wilderness (Exodus 17:5ff) provided literal water for Israel; but much more than that is in evidence here. As Marsh said, \"The rock was Christ, not `is' or `is a type of' ... and this is a clear statement of the pre-existence of Christ.\" F10 \n \n Rock: used illustratively; 1Cr 10:4 (twice), figuratively, of Christ;\n \n Do you finally understand that that he isn't talking about just the physical aspect of the meat, drink and rock? I am hoping I was clear enough when I showed earlier how your right and wrong. Yes the adjective in this one instance is not making the noun non-physical, but again he isn't speaking of just the physical meat, drink and rock is he?\n I said pretty much all of this and you came back with a lesson in Greek and how adjectives work. Later implying that this one instance of how the word is used is the only way that it should be used. These verses are at best marginally relevant to the substance of the resurrected body. \n If you wanted to try and make a valid meaningful point don't compare words that are being used to describe two completely different things. If I use the word dim, I could be referring to the intelligence of something or the amount of light it produces. It doesn't mean either is made of dim nor would I be correct in thinking a light bulb is stupid or that a person is producing a minimal amount of light.\n \n \nOr, 1 Cor 15.44. Paul writes that &#963;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#963;&#969;&#956;&#945; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#957; &#949;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#963;&#969;&#956;&#945; &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#957; -- it is sown a soulish body [and] it is raised a spiritual body. The &#963;&#969;&#956;&#945; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#957; is made of flesh and blood, not soul. After all, Adam was made &#949;&#953;&#962; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#951;&#957; &#950;&#969;&#963;&#945;&#957; (into living soul), but was not made of soul.\n\n \n That's odd my Greek (see below taken from Blue Letter Bible) is a little different than yours. Probably because you, in order to be right, use words that don't exist in the English language. Also the natural body, at least the ones that were alive, were believed in Paul's time to consist of 3 things 1) flesh 2) blood 3) soul. A living person was not made of soul entirely, but was not made of flesh or blood alone either, but all three. \n 15:44 &#963;&#960;&#949;&#8055;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#963;&#8182;&#956;&#945; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#8057;&#957; &#7952;&#947;&#949;&#8055;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#963;&#8182;&#956;&#945; &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8057;&#957; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#963;&#8182;&#956;&#945; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#8057;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#963;&#8182;&#956;&#945; &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8057;&#957; \n It is sown 4687 a natural 5591 body 4983; it is raised 1453 a spiritual 4152 body 4983.

Though Paul is using the noun, it can hardly be the case that he images Jesus being composed of spirit. \n\n \n I won't be picky about Genesis or Corinthians, but why can it hardly be the case Paul thinks of Jesus as a spiritual being? Paul only knows a non-physical Jesus, his only knowledge of a physically risen Jesus is hearsay. A spiritual Jesus is the only credible argument he can make. Nobody looks up into the sky and sees Jesus flying around. There is no Heaven or Angels to be seen. If they are physical where are they?\n \n \nBefore the end of the patristic period, for example, angels were believed to be physical beings composed of highly rarefied, supernatural substances.\n\n \n Great, the end of the patristic period was @ 500AD. 1 Corinthians was written @ 60AD and in 60AD Angels were thought to be spiritual beings.\n Angel:\n \"a messenger\" (from angello, \"to deliver a message\"), sent whether by God or by man or by Satan, \"is also used of a guardian or representative in Rev 1:20, cp. Mat 18:10; Act 12:15 (where it is better understood as = 'ghost'), superior to man, Hbr 2:7; Psa 8:5, belonging to Heaven, Mat 24:36; Mar 12:25, and to God, Luk 12:8, and engaged in His service, Psa 103:20. \"Angels\" are spirits, Hbr 1:14, i.e., they have not material bodies as men have; they are either human in form, or can assume the human form when necessary, cp. Luk 24:4, with Luk 24:23, Act 10:3 with Act 10:30. \n \n \nIt's pretty clear that Paul's resurrection has nothing to do with the soul leaving the body; 1) that is not what the word \"resurrection\" meant, 2) it is clear that Paul's resurrection occurs at the parousia, even for those Christians that had already died (1 Thess 4). How could he be envisioning transmigration of the soul if the dead had to wait for Jesus' return?\n\n \n The belief at the time was a person was not thought to be dead until the soul had left the body. Resurrection referred to the life one lived after one had died and was subsequently brought back to life. The Jewish belief was that it would happen for everybody at the same time, reuniting the soul with the body. So for the people of the time it was necessary for the soul to leave the body. Paul the Pharisee would have at least been familiar with this and actually it fits in easily with what Paul states.\n \n \nHehe, this is cute. Pappillion, the word is &#968;&#965;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#957; (which we can transliterate as psychikon), an adjectival form of the word \"soul.\" There is nothing creative about it, just a literal translation. Hence (LSJ):\n \n &#968;&#8161;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;, &#942;, &#972;&#957;, of the soul\n\n \n Hehe soulish isn't a word in the English language. Go look in a dictionary. Although it makes everything work out for you at first, later on you will discover making up things will cause problems, so will believing everything you read as you are not the only one to make this mistake. \n \n \nI asked if you thought the resurrection was non-physical for Paul because he says the resurrection body will not be made of flesh and blood. I pointed out that this does not mean the body will be non-physical because there are plenty of other things it could be made out of. \n\n Name two. \n \n \nI brought up how Paul uses the noun &#968;&#965;&#967;&#951; (guess what this word means?), and how this tells us how not to read Paul's use of the noun &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945; (spirit). Your response? Well, there was none.\n\n \n I didn't respond because it was the same nonsense as everything else you posted. \n \n \"The language of Hbr 4:12 suggests the extreme difficulty of distinguishing between the soul and the spirit, alike in their nature and in their activities. Generally speaking the spirit is the higher, the soul the lower element. The spirit may be recognized as the life principle bestowed on man by God, the soul as the resulting life constituted in the individual, the body being the material organism animated by soul and spirit. . . . \n \"Body and soul are the constituents of the man according to Mat 6:25; 10:28; Luk 12:20; Act 20:10; body and spirit according to Luk 8:55; 1Cr 5:3; 7:34; Jam 2:26. In Mat 26:38 the emotions are associated with the soul, in Jhn 13:21 with the spirit; cp. also Psa 42:11 with 1Ki 21:5. In Psa 35:9 the soul rejoices in God, in Luk 1:47 the spirit. \n \"Apparently, then, the relationships may be thus summed up 'Soma, body, and pneuma, spirit, may be separated, pneuma and psuche, soul, can only be distinguished' (Cremer).\"* \n [* From notes on Thessalonians, by Hogg and Vine, pp. 205-207.]\n \n So as you would say lets recap\n \n A: Soulish isn't an English word. Therefore nothing can be \"literally\" translated to it.\n B: Angels in Paul's time were thought to be spiritual beings that could take human or material form. \n C : Christians believe Jesus' raised body was the one he died in. Not some random unknown material.\n D: Imagination, ignorance and speculation on the part of ancient people is not evidence for or against what the resurrected body is comprised of. If one wanted to prove dryads, trolls and hobbits exist or that leeching is a sound medical procedure then maybe.\n E: The definition of Spiritual always implies something non-physical. 1 Cor 10:3-4 uses something physical to relate a non-physical concept. The same word may multiple meanings and can be used to express different concepts. As you earlier stated any English speaker would know this. Also, these two verses have little relevance in trying to determine the resurrected body's nature. \n F: 1 Cor 15:44 Oh why bother, I already explained what was wrong with this and the rest of what you posted. If you don't get it by now you never will.\n \n Anything else?",

   "I'm only going to respond to half of this for now.\n \n \nThe resurrected body will not be flesh and blood because that is what Paul says, but I will take it a step further and suggest that the resurrected body will in its natural state, be spiritual.\n\n \n Paul plainly says the resurrection body will not be made of flesh and blood. Paul plainly says the resurrection body will be \"spiritual.\" The problem is you taking \"spiritual\" to mean \"non-physical,\" something it does not, and indeed, cannot, mean.\n \n The resurrection body is \"spiritual\" in that it is god-given -- transformed and animated by YHWH -- the sense the word always takes in Paul.\n \n \nYes, a body could be made of many different physical things. The modern mind has created a number of different materials to make bodies and body parts, but that fact doesn&#8217;t help you. The Christian position is not the resurrected body is, was or will be made of any one or combination of those many other physical things, but that Jesus was raised in the same body he died in.\n\n \n The position of Paul is that Jesus' body was transformed into something different from the ordinary body of humans, but still a body and still physical. Although he does not name the substance, one could imagine any number of them (e.g. \"supernatural\" substances like air, fire, etc.)\n \n \nI am suggesting it is spiritual, which is the only other biblically based option.\n\n \n Your suggestion is an anachronistic understanding of the English word \"spiritual,\" an unfortunate consequence of your ignorance of ancient history and the ancient Greek language.\n \n \n [giant snip] Do you finally understand that that he isn&#8217;t talking about just the physical aspect of the meat, drink and rock? I am hoping I was clear enough when I showed earlier how your right and wrong. Yes the adjective in this one instance is not making the noun non-physical, but again he isn&#8217;t speaking of just the physical meat, drink and rock is he?\n\n \n Paul is invoking biblical tradition about the Exodus to offer premonitory instances in support of his argument about idol meat. In other words, of course Paul is not invoking the physical meat and water just to speak of physical meat and water, and if this is your point, it's an awfully goofy one to make. When I invoked 1 Cor 10, it was to say something very simple, something that the ancient commentary you Googled (Henry? Is this is the 18th century?) agrees with; when Paul speaks of \"spiritual food\" and \"spiritual drink\" he does not mean \"non-physical food\" and \"non-physical drink.\" He means god-given nourishment, and this, along with all the other examples I have given you, clearly destroys the amateurish conclusion you had drawn about the word.\n \n &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; does not mean \"made of spirit\" or \"non-physical,\" however much that seems like a plausible reading of Paul in English.\n \n ETA: And if by \"he isn't speaking of just the physical meat [etc]\" you mean that \"spiritual food,\" \"spiritual drink,\" etc. carries some sense other than the physical, ordinary (but god-given) food/drink of the Exodus tradition, you're wrong. To draw an analogy with the physical Exodus food/drink does not render it non-physical.\n \n \nI said pretty much all of this and you came back with a lesson in Greek and how adjectives work. Later implying that this one instance of how the word is used is the only way that it should be used. These verses are at best marginally relevant to the substance of the resurrected body. \n If you wanted to try and make a valid meaningful point don&#8217;t compare words that are being used to describe two completely different things. If I use the word dim, I could be referring to the intelligence of something or the amount of light it produces. It doesn&#8217;t mean either is made of dim nor would I be correct in thinking a light bulb is stupid or that a person is producing a minimal amount of light.\n\n \n This is a lovely. See pappillion, I already know you think Paul intends the &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; &#963;&#969;&#956;&#945; to mean \"non-physical body,\" but I still have no idea why you think that. The only \"evidence\" you offered was that Paul says \"spiritual,\" but it was exactly what I offered above that shows why this doesn't work. When Paul uses &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962;, it never means \"non-physical\" or \"made of spirit.\"\n \n So, can you tell me why you think Paul is using \"&#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962;\" to mean what you think he does? Not \"this is what I think\" or \"I can imagine Paul saying something like that in principle.\" What evidence leads you to think this is what he actually said and meant.\n \nThat&#8217;s odd my Greek (see below taken from Blue Letter Bible) is a little different than yours. Probably because you, in order to be right, use words that don&#8217;t exist in the English language.\n\n \n This has already been addressed. I have shown you that my translations are perfectly acceptable, and even quoted the entry from the standard Greek-English lexicon for you.\n \n \nAlso the natural body, at least the ones that were alive, were believed in Paul&#8217;s time to consist of 3 things 1) flesh 2) blood 3) soul. A living person was not made of soul entirely, but was not made of flesh or blood alone either, but all three.\n\n \n :xbanghead\n \n This was the point, pappillion. Even though Paul says Adam was made a \"living soul,\" he certainly does not mean Adam was made entirely of soul. Given the carefully constructed parallelism, it is also the case that Paul does not mean Jesus was made out of spirit. To do so would require a bizarre understanding of &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962;/&#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945; and breaking the parallelism.\n \n So here's the deal, again. Your entire case for Paul thinking resurrection was \"non-physical\" is dependent upon smuggling in a 21st century sense of the English word \"spiritual.\" When we look at Paul's work in its original language, its obvious that the word does not carry the sense you'd like it to. When we look at the parallelism between the pre and post-resurrection bodies, it is even clearer. In other words, your case has not been made at all.",

Mat 18:10; Act 12:15 (where it is better understood as = 'ghost'), superior to man, Hbr 2:7; Psa 8:5, belonging to Heaven, Mat 24:36; Mar 12:25, and to God, Luk 12:8, and engaged in His service, Psa 103:20. \"Angels\" are spirits, Hbr 1:14, i.e., they have not material bodies as men have; they are either human in form, or can assume the human form when necessary, cp. Luk 24:4, with Luk 24:23, Act 10:3 with Act 10:30.\n\n \n Yawn, more copypasta. Wrong copypasta.\n \n To say that because Heb 1.14 calls angels \"spirits\" they must be immaterial is gratuitous (nor is it even clear that that is what your copypasta is saying...\"material bodies as men have\" does not necessarily mean \"are without bodies\"). Tatian and the Apocalypse of Abraham could say that angels have a \"spiritual structure\", but still maintain they were composed of fire or air. \n \n And anyway, there are plenty of clear examples of what i'm saying. Jewish literature frequently took Ps 104 as saying that angels were made of fire or wind (2 Baruch 21 plainly says that angels are \"flame and fire\"). Philostratus' Life of Apollonius has Iarchas saying that gods are made out of aether. Discussing Anaximenes, Plutarch says that souls are composed of air.\n \n The import is clear. The only way Paul's \"not flesh and blood\" could necessarily imply non-physicality is if flesh and blood were the only thing ancients believed stuff was made of. But they believed supernatural beings could be composed of all sorts of different things.\n \n \nThe belief at the time was a person was not thought to be dead until the soul had left the body. Resurrection referred to the life one lived after one had died and was subsequently brought back to life. The Jewish belief was that it would happen for everybody at the same time, reuniting the soul with the body. So for the people of the time it was necessary for the soul to leave the body. Paul the Pharisee would have at least been familiar with this and actually it fits in easily with what Paul states.\n\n \n Now this is bizarre. First, you strongly intimated that for Paul, Jesus' \"resurrection\" was in fact the departure of his soul from his body. Now, you appear to (rightly) recognize that for ancient Jews resurrection was one bodily coming back to life. Life after life after death, to use Wright's phrase. Now, given that Paul is speaking of resurrection, and given that Paul's general resurrection is speaking, not of events immediately following death, but events that will occur at the culmination of the eschaton to the death and the living (and that this mirrors Jesus' own resurrection), and given that Paul was indeed Jewish, I haven't the foggiest idea how you can turn around and say Paul wasn't talking about resurrection but transmigration of the soul.\n \n Nothing in Paul would lead anyone to think Jesus' resurrection was the departure of his soul. Nothing in Paul would lead anyone to think the departure of souls was what he meant when he was talking about the resurrection of believers. He cannot mean this.",

   "And lastly...\n \n \nHehe soulish isn't a word in the English language. Go look in a dictionary. Although it makes everything work out for you at first, later on you will discover making up things will cause problems, so will believing everything you read as you are not the only one to make this mistake.\n\n \n \"Soulish\" is frequently used in the exegetical literature for the adjectival form of the word \"soul.\" Yale's Anchor Bible Dictionary (entry on soul):\n \n \"In another respect, it is also the place of listening to and trusting in God. Thus, God's spirit is already living in earthly men, if and when they do not remain merely \"psychic\" (literally \"soulish\" ) men (1 Cor 2:14).\"\n \n Trail's An Exegetical Summary of 1 Corinthians 1-9:\n \n \"He is a 'soulish' man, controlled by his soul or natural self [EBC, NCBC].\"\n \n Schreiner's commentary on 1, 2 Peter and Jude (NAC):\n \n \"He sees a mixture of traditional beliefs and Gnostic conceptions. The opponents in Jude were libertines (vv. 4, 18). Verse 19, in which the opponents are said to be \"soulish\" (pyschikoi) and are charged with not having the Spirit, indicates the use of technical terms from Gnosticism.\"\n \n Richardson's commentary on James (NAC):\n \n \"This other 'wisdom' is 'unspiritual' or soulish\"\n \n I could go on, of course. Now, if you have some other adjectival form of the English word \"soul\" you'd prefer, feel free to substitute it. Either way, my point is exactly the same and precisely as strong; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; is an adjectival form of the Greek &#968;&#965;&#967;&#951; (soul) just as &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; is an adjectival form of the Greek &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945; (spirit). To say that the pre-resurrection body was &#968;&#965;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; is not say that body is made of soul -- likewise, to say the post-resurrection body is &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; is not to say it is made of spirit.\n \n \nName two.\n\n \n This has already been done. Heck, you named some other substances. \n \n \nI didn't respond because it was the same nonsense as everything else you posted. \n \n \"The language of Hbr 4:12 suggests the extreme difficulty of distinguishing between the soul and the spirit, alike in their nature and in their activities. Generally speaking the spirit is the higher, the soul the lower element. The spirit may be recognized as the life principle bestowed on man by God, the soul as the resulting life constituted in the individual, the body being the material organism animated by soul and spirit. . . . \n \"Body and soul are the constituents of the man according to Mat 6:25; 10:28; Luk 12:20; Act 20:10; body and spirit according to Luk 8:55; 1Cr 5:3; 7:34; Jam 2:26. In Mat 26:38 the emotions are associated with the soul, in Jhn 13:21 with the spirit; cp. also Psa 42:11 with 1Ki 21:5. In Psa 35:9 the soul rejoices in God, in Luk 1:47 the spirit. \n \"Apparently, then, the relationships may be thus summed up 'Soma, body, and pneuma, spirit, may be separated, pneuma and psuche, soul, can only be distinguished' (Cremer).\"* \n [* From notes on Thessalonians, by Hogg and Vine, pp. 205-207.]\n\n \n Another heaping bowl of copypasta. It would actually help if it addressed the argument I made in some way. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Paul's argument involves carefully constructed parallelism: the first man, Adam [1], was made a living [2] soul [3], the last Adam [1] was made into lifemaking [2] spirit [3]. First Adam is set against last Adam. Living is set against lifemaking. Soul is set against spirit. But to call Adam &#968;&#965;&#967;&#951; is not to say that Adam was made of soul. Likewise, to call Jesus &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945; is not to say he is made of spirit.\n \n \nA: Soulish isn't an English word. Therefore nothing can be \"literally\" translated to it.\n\n \n &#968;&#965;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; is literally an adjectival form of the &#968;&#965;&#967;&#951;, which we translate in English as \"soul.\" Those trying to convey that literal sense in English often use the word \"soulish,\" perhaps because there is no better substitute. Objecting that \"there is no such word in English\" is just an attempt to obfuscate the point.\n \n \nB: Angels in Paul's time were thought to be spiritual beings that could take human or material form.\n\n \n As the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church says, \"their immaterial and spiritual nature, however, was not fully recognized until Dionysius the Ps.-Areopagite and &#65279;St&#65279; Gregory the Great.\" A familarity with the primary data will bear this out. Copy-pasting and credulously swallowing some million year old secondary source from BLB you dug up ten minutes before posting is just another sign of your amateurish approach to ancient history and Pauline exegesis. \n \n And even supposing you were right, this is just another attempt at obfuscation.\n \n \nC : Christians believe Jesus' raised body was the one he died in. Not some random unknown material.\n\n \n Paul believed Jesus' raised body was the one he died in, transformed. This being \"the Christian view\" or not is irrelvant to the subject at hand.\n \n \nD: Imagination, ignorance and speculation on the part of ancient people is not evidence for or against what the resurrected body is comprised of. If one wanted to prove dryads, trolls and hobbits exist or that leeching is a sound medical procedure then maybe.\n\n \n This is more category error. The topic is your completely unsupported assertions about what Paul believed, not the truth of those beliefs.\n \n \n \nE: The definition of Spiritual always implies something non-physical. 1 Cor 10:3-4 uses something physical to relate a non-physical concept. The same word may multiple meanings and can be used to express different concepts. As you earlier stated any English speaker would know this. Also, these two verses have little relevance in trying to determine the resurrected body's nature.\n\n \n \"Spiritual\" never implies something non-physical in Paul. The \"spiritual food\" et al. is unambiguously physical meat, water, etc. To use physical meat et al. and draw an analogy to contemporary Christian experience in absolutely no ways means that &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; is being used in a non-physical sense. To say otherwise makes no sense.\n \n In fact, i'd go even further and say that the -&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; construction never implies material composition in Greek, be it Paul or any other ancient wrter.\n \n \nF: 1 Cor 15:44 Oh why bother, I already explained what was wrong with this and the rest of what you posted. If you don't get it by now you never will.\n\n \n Except you didn't explain how I was wrong \"with the rest.\" Your response to 1 Cor 15.44 was to copypaste some irrelvant dictionary entry on the word \"soul.\" In all, the sort of showing i'd expect from someone unversed in these matters.\n \n One final summation, because I consider these issues effectively closed.\n \n Going on what I usually see from amateurs like yourself, I posted what I thought might be the lines of \"evidence\" for a non-physical resurrection body:\n \n 1) Paul says the body will be \"spiritual.\" I showed that in Paul, the word never means \"non-physical\" or \"made of spirit,\" and specifically cited the case of 1 Cor 10. You now seem to agree that Paul's \"spiritual food\" and \"spiritual drink\" was actual physical food and actual physical drink, which was the point. However, you have also said that it is also, somehow, non-physical. Of course, this is pure nonsense. The food and drink of the Exodus tradition is actual food and drink, and this fact doesn't change regardless of the analogies Paul draws to it.\n \n 2) Paul says the body will not be flesh and blood. I observed that the only way in which this would mean the resurrection body is non-physical is if flesh and blood were the only things a body could be made of. The first time around, your response was to say that Paul labels it \"spiritual,\" to which I pointed you back to point 1 above. Now, instead of acknowledging the obviousness of the logic, you decided to glom onto an offhand remark I had made about angels. In actual fact, angels were believed to be composed of stuff, stuff that was not flesh and blood. Gods could be thought to be made of different stuff, stuff that was not flesh and blood. Demons could be thought to be made of different stuff, stuff that was not flesh and blood. I could have pointed you to Paul's own discussion of different types of bodies and flesh (1 Cor 15.39-41 -- one wonders the point of this digression if he believed in a non-physical resurrection). But that would have been unecessary. The point is made by simply realizing that, to the ancients as to modern men, the universe is not composed of \"flesh and blood\" and nothing else. Thus, \"not flesh and blood\" need not imply \"nothing at all.\"\n \n 3) I pointed out the parallelism with &#968;&#965;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; and &#968;&#965;&#967;&#951; in 15.44-45. The first time around, you tried to suggest that &#968;&#965;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; could not be taken as an adjectival form of \"soul,\" but I showed you the Liddell-Scott-Jones entry and the words of other exegetes. Now, you've bizarrely taken to saying that the English \"soulish\" is not \"really\" a word, and therefore....something. Whatever adjectival form of \"soul\" you'd like to use, my point has the same force. The &#963;&#969;&#956;&#945; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; stands in parallel to the &#963;&#969;&#956;&#945; &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962;. Adam, the &#968;&#965;&#967;&#951;&#957; &#950;&#969;&#963;&#945;&#957; stands in parallel to Jesus, the last Adam, who was made &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945; &#950;&#969;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#965;&#957;. This strongly suggests what a careful study of &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; elsewhere in Paul would already imply, namely, that Paul is not saying Jesus was non-physical or made of spirit.\n \n In sum, your belief is built on sand, and even if it weren't, you aren't equipped to demonstrate it. These issues are closed, but if you even take the time to study the subject and come up with some actual arguments, feel free to present them.",

   "I just responded to the three summary points from the end of your last post. The rest just repeats or isn't worth the effort, but there should be more than enough below.\n \n \nOne final summation, because I consider these issues effectively closed.\n \n Going on what I usually see from amateurs like yourself, I posted what I thought might be the lines of \"evidence\" for a non-physical resurrection body:\n \n 1) Paul says the body will be \"spiritual.\" I showed that in Paul, the word never means \"non-physical\" or \"made of spirit,\" and specifically cited the case of 1 Cor 10. You now seem to agree that Paul's \"spiritual food\" and \"spiritual drink\" was actual physical food and actual physical drink, which was the point. However, you have also said that it is also, somehow, non-physical. Of course, this is pure nonsense. The food and drink of the Exodus tradition is actual food and drink, and this fact doesn't change regardless of the analogies Paul draws to it.\n\n \n \n This argument isn&#8217;t about what the specific material(s) of the RB are, but whether it is physical or not and whether it&#8217;s spiritual or the body possessed in life transformed. The question to Paul was not what will It be made of, but what will it be. The answers provided by him in 1 Corinthians deal with that question specifically. What something is made of can often be determined by what something is, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that an answer to one is correct for the other. \n \n You state spiritual never means or implies non-physical or made of spirit, ok then what does it mean? By itself, not attached to any other word. \n As for made of spirit, you keep bringing that up, but nobody is saying it does. Except for you, so you can keep saying that it doesn&#8217;t. \n \n The purpose of this word is not to convey an understanding of material composition, so the fact that you point out that it doesn&#8217;t didn&#8217;t come as much of a surprise. What it does do is express the understanding that what it is used in conjunction with has both material and immaterial properties, that there is a conceptual aspect as well as the physical. Not one or the other, not one then other, but simultaneously. \n \n What you should have said is that use of the word does not change something that is physical to something that isn&#8217;t .That would be accurate, but nobody said that it did, well again except you, but only so you could then argue the point with yourself.\n \n Here is an example, imagine in front of you are two pieces of meat and two cups of water. One piece of meat and one cup of water is spiritual meat and drink, the other is not. They look the same, they taste the same, they smell the same, they feel the same, the cow and the faucet they came from sound the same. \n \n Are the two sets of meat and drink the same? Hint&#8230; No they are not.\n What is the difference between the two?\n The difference isn&#8217;t physical is it? Physically there is no difference. The difference is immaterial, conceptual and not physical isn&#8217;t it?\n The statement in which I told you about the food and drink is where you learned of the difference wasn&#8217;t it?\n What word was it that made you aware that there was an immaterial, conceptual and not physical difference?\n The word spiritual.\n \n As for 1 CR 10:3-4 the first problem is obvious, you use it to support the composition argument, which means you wasted everybody&#8217;s time, it isn&#8217;t applicable for this issue. The other problems are off topic, but I will comment anyway, since you wanted to play dumb and drag it out. From your posts you were aware Paul&#8217;s intention was to warn the Corinthians against certain activities because they were incorrect in assuming they would be forgiven by partaking of the Sacraments. You also were aware of Paul&#8217;s use of an analogy suggesting the circumstances of the Jews during the Exodus were comparable to the current situation of the Corinthians. He compares the food and drink of the exodus with the Sacraments. The point being the sacraments, as the food and drink during the Exodus were not a free pass to willfully sin. The issue this caused was the use of the word spiritual in describing the food and drink. Being fully aware of these facts you continued to argue that by using the word spiritual the Exodus food and drink was not to be understood as being immaterial or composed of spirit, doing so after I explained several times I was not suggesting it was. I showed above it doesn&#8217;t alter the physical make-up, but creates a relationship between something physical, in this case the food and drink with a non-physical concept, making that physical object more than it was, changed in it&#8217;s conceptual perception, but remaining physically no different. You eventually made a poor attempt to address this by stating the food and drink were spiritual, because they had been God given. That is it, just that God gave out some food, nothing more? The fact that it is God given is secondary to the fact you completely ignore and later deny which is why God has given it, in the case of the Hebrews or it&#8217;s significance in the case of Christians. \n But you know all this and had you made an intelligent argument using all the facts you might have made you point, after all my side isn&#8217;t the popular belief. I don&#8217;t even believe my side. So why is this so hard for you? Do you need me to argue your side for you? \n \n Lastly, does 1 CR 10:3-4 have anything at all to do with the RB? No. Are these verses the only ones which use the word? No. You stated that spiritual used here was indicative of every instance of it&#8217;s use in Paul. This is incorrect. The manner in which the word is used here is the only time it is used in this way. I believe you know this and is in part the reason your example is 5 chapters away and has nothing to do with the RB? \n \n So much for point #1. \n \n \n \n2) Paul says the body will not be flesh and blood. I observed that the only way in which this would mean the resurrection body is non-physical is if flesh and blood were the only things a body could be made of. The first time around, your response was to say that Paul labels it \"spiritual,\" to which I pointed you back to point 1 above.\n \n \n Pity you failed to observe any of the other verses in which Paul details the characteristics of the RB? Do you suppose that any one, or all of those may significantly reduce the infinite possibilities you imagine for the RB? Secondly, your limited reasoning does nothing to confirm or deny whether the RB is physical or not. \n \n \nNow, instead of acknowledging the obviousness of the logic, you decided to glom onto an offhand remark I had made about angels. In actual fact, angels were believed to be composed of stuff, stuff that was not flesh and blood. \n\n \n Whether an offhand remark or not you presented it as evidence and I can only surmise it&#8217;s now seeming insignificance has more to do with it being wrong than anything else. Despite twice calling it inconsequential, you again try and defend it. Art, you were wrong then and your still wrong. Get a grip, the Angel argument is meaningless. If you have your heart set on stuff that wouldn&#8217;t exclude immaterial stuff. Also, didn&#8217;t you earlier make a point of saying only what Paul believed was relevant? Being creatures of heaven, Paul would have believed them to be suited for their environment. Not relevant, but worth mentioning, stuff seems a little amateurish as an answer, which should be funny coming from me, since I am the amateur here. Maybe now you understand why I didn&#8217;t acknowledge the obviousness of your logic, had anything logical been evident, I assure you I would have. \n \n \n \nGods could be thought to be made of different stuff, stuff that was not flesh and blood. Demons could be thought to be made of different stuff, stuff that was not flesh and blood. I could have pointed you to Paul's own discussion of different types of bodies and flesh (1 Cor 15.39-41 -- one wonders the point of this digression if he believed in a non-physical resurrection). But that would have been unecessary. The point is made by simply realizing that, to the ancients as to modern men, the universe is not composed of \"flesh and blood\" and nothing else. Thus, \"not flesh and blood\" need not imply \"nothing at all.\"\n\n \n \n Fascinating. You must have put a great deal of thought into this paragraph. What your saying is the RB could be made of anything, with the exception of flesh and blood and the condition that it must be something physical. How about golden cake with cream filling for the RB Art? Those would be considered stuff, wouldn&#8217;t they? Physical as well. Wouldn&#8217;t that just be grand, we could die and come back as Twinkies. \n \n You may want to reconsider the above statements?\n \n You consider the opinion of every Tom, Dick and Harry throughout time as a viable possibility, just as long as it is physical of course. I have already pointed out how Paul describes the RB. Also how you made it clear this concerns what Paul believed. Why now is Paul&#8217;s opinion the only one unnecessary to consider? How do you in the same paragraph reference Paul&#8217;s description of the RB with it could be made of anything anyone throughout time believed plausible? \n \n No Art. Not even close to correct. Do you read what you write before you post. You should consider it.\n \n Since when is not physical mean nothing at all? Wouldn&#8217;t nothing be the absence of anything. You keep implying that a spiritual RB is some formless collection of thought, it isn&#8217;t. \n \n Paul&#8217;s description of different flesh is perfectly compatible with a non-physical RB. The need to make clear what the RB will be and why suggests it would have been something that was unfamiliar. Why spend so much effort describing it, if he could have just said the it will be transformed, but no noticeable difference to what you have now? Instead he explains that there are different bodies for every types of life and that each one is designed by God to be suited to its environment. That our bodies, born of Adam and the earth may not enter Heaven. To avoid death, Jesus will give life in Heaven in the form of a body able to enter Heaven.\n \n What doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense is if the RB comes back without any noticeable change. Why a natural (odd shouldn&#8217;t that be soulish) body and a spiritual body. Why not just say the body transformed? Why is there constantly a distinction between the two if it is nothing more than the same thing with new paint? Why no reassurance that for those whose body has been destroyed, it will be made whole or the ones born with physical defects will be made normal. The blind will see, the deaf will hear, the insane will be made sane. The ugly beautiful and so on and so on. Not having the miracles of modern medicine these and issues like them would have been a major concern, but nothing suggests it was. My guess is that it wasn&#8217;t necessary, because those are all physical earthly concerns that will not exist with a non-physical, suited to the conditions present in heaven RB.\n \n Really disappointed with this 2nd summary. It&#8217;s just a whole paragraph of unintelligent opinion with a touch of bitterness. \n \n \n \n \n3) I pointed out the parallelism with &#968;&#965;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; and &#968;&#965;&#967;&#951; in 15.44-45. The first time around, you tried to suggest that &#968;&#965;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; could not be taken as an adjectival form of \"soul,\" but I showed you the Liddell-Scott-Jones entry and the words of other exegetes. Now, you've bizarrely taken to saying that the English \"soulish\" is not \"really\" a word, and therefore....something. Whatever adjectival form of \"soul\" you'd like to use, my point has the same force. The &#963;&#969;&#956;&#945; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; stands in parallel to the &#963;&#969;&#956;&#945; &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962;. Adam, the &#968;&#965;&#967;&#951;&#957; &#950;&#969;&#963;&#945;&#957; stands in parallel to Jesus, the last Adam, who was made &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945; &#950;&#969;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#965;&#957;. This strongly suggests what a careful study of &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; elsewhere in Paul would already imply, namely, that Paul is not saying Jesus was non-physical or made of spirit.\n \n In sum, your belief is built on sand, and even if it weren't, you aren't equipped to demonstrate it. These issues are closed, but if you even take the time to study the subject and come up with some actual arguments, feel free to present them.\n\n Art from the first time you used the word soulish in your irrelevant pursuit of a bodily composition argument I have never once said anything other than it is not a word in English and therefore cannot be a literal translation for anything nor can it be the best possible choice as you stated.\n Tell you what, post which book, chapter and verse it appears in any English bible and you can say you were right. Don&#8217;t spend to much time because it isn&#8217;t in any English bible. Do you know why? Because it isn&#8217;t a word, so the vast majority of people would have no idea of what they were reading. \n By the way, there is no adjective form of the word soul, unless you happen to be referring to African-American culture, which you aren&#8217;t, are you? If you think about it, you should be able to figure out why.\n Your analysis of 1 CR 15:44-45 really doesn&#8217;t say anything other than natural body to spiritual body, Adam to Jesus, living soul to quickening spirit and that for you means physical body? Sorry just don&#8217;t see it. Call me this, that or whatever, but in order to make that conclusion you have to already have made up your mind as to what the RB is. Your 1 CR 10:3-4 example if applied here does not conflict with a non-physical understanding. The best you could hope for with this is a doesn&#8217;t say either way. \n The natural, physical, earthly body which came first, for the first Adam, made of the physical earth and is subject to sin, death and so on, those things associated with an earthly, physical existence, which contrasts the spiritual, heavenly body made sinless and immortal, which is given after the 1st by the life making spirit the 2nd Adam. Everything about the 1st Adam body is physical and of the Earth and therefore isn&#8217;t suited for existence in heaven. Everything about the 2nd Adam is suited for a heavenly existence. The 1st Adam representing the beginning contrasts the 2nd Adam representing the end. The soul representing life on earth contrasts with the spirit being life in Heaven and the natural body that of earth and the spiritual body of Heaven. This all fits together with the other verses that describe the RB. \n If you really think about it what you propose, the same physical body transformed is like covering lead with gold. It doesn&#8217;t matter how much gold you use it will never be pure 100% gold. It doesn&#8217;t matter what you do to the earthly body, change, transform or whatever if the foundation of those changes is still the 1st flesh and blood Adam body it can never be perfect, it will always have something of earth in it.\n I would say it was a good exchange and you brought up some interesting points, but you know I would be lying, so I won&#8217;t bother. I accept your withdrawal, this wasn&#8217;t going to go any farther than it already has. emoticon_xbye",
