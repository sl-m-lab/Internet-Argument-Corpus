   "The sensitive issue is being intensively debated and those talks are already a challenge. Well, bases are still vague probability while threats of explosions are reality. The Bulgaria embassy staffers in Turkey found a suspicious package at the embassy campus. There was a warning there (written in poor Bulgarian) threatening with punishing attacks on Bulgaria by \"warriors of Allah\" as kind of reaction to the planting of bases here. This doesn't look inspiring!\n Well, one more thing is worth mentioning. They say the package was discovered soon after street orderlies had finished their part of work near the embassy building. The embassy guards assert they spoke Russian and there were ethnic Chechens among them. In embassy they think that these people are no strangers to the package. The terrorist threats execution, they could do this part of job too, those Chechens I guess.",
