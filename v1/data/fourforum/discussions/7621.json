   "The order of creation is still wrong: the earth exists before the sun etc.\n\n \n How could the days of Genesis 1 be literal if the Sun wasn't created until the fourth day?\n \n We know today that all it takes to have a day-night cycle is a rotating Earth and light coming from one direction. The Bible tells us clearly that God created light on the first day, as well as the Earth. Thus we can deduce that the Earth was already rotating in space relative to this created light.\n \n God can, of course, create light without a secondary source. We are told that in the new heavens and Earth there will be no need for sun or moon (Rev 21:23). In Genesis, God even defines a day and a night in terms of light or its absence.\n \n 'Progressive creationists' sometimes use the argument that the days are really long periods, although God could have used words for that if He had really meant that (see How long were the days of Genesis 1?). The creation of the sun after the Earth undermines progressive creationists' attempts to harmonise the Bible with billions of years. So they must explain this teaching away. Some assert that what really happened on this fourth 'day' was that the sun and other heavenly bodies 'appeared' when a dense cloud layer dissipated after millions of years. This is not only fanciful science, but bad exegesis of Hebrew. The word 'asah means 'make' throughout Genesis 1, and is sometimes used interchangeably with 'create' (bara'), e.g. in Genesis 1:26-27. It is pure desperation to apply a different meaning to the same word in the same grammatical construction in the same passage, just to fit in with atheistic evolutionary ideas like the 'big bang'. If God had meant 'appeared', then He presumably would have used the Hebrew word for appear (ra'ah), as when the dry land 'appeared' as the waters gathered in one place on Day 3 (Genesis 1:9). We have checked over 20 major translations, and all clearly teach that the sun, moon and stars were made on the fourth day.\n \n The evidence that ordinary days are being referred to is so overwhelming that even liberal Hebrew scholars admit that the author can have had no other intent - particularly when the words 'evening' and 'morning' are used from the first day. (See The Answers Book Chapter 2, and Six Days? Honestly!)\n \n On the fourth day the present system was instituted as the Earth's temporary light-bearers were made, so the diffused light from the first day was no longer needed. [Interestingly, after writing this article, I found that Calvin had made the same point (see Calvin says: Genesis means what it says). This shows that once again, skeptics just repeat arguments long ago refuted by Bible believing scholars.]\n \n http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/1203.asp",

   "So, just out of curiousity, how long do you think the days were? How old do you think the earth is?\n\n \n How old is the earth? What do they say, 4.5 billion years or so? Sounds good to me.\n \n How long was a creation day? Don't know exactly but here's a clue:\n \n On the third day, God formed the land out of the seas. There is no time frame given for the formation of the land and seas. Some time after the land was formed, God created the plants:\n \n Then God said, \"Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with seed in them, on the earth\"; and it was so. (Genesis 1:11)\n \n And the earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. (Genesis 1:12)\n \n The text clearly states that the earth \"sprouted\" the plants (the Hebrew word deshe, Strong's #H1877, usually refers to grasses). The Hebrew word dasha, (Strong's #H1876) indicates that the plants grew from either seeds or small seedlings in order to have \"sprouted.\" In addition, these plants produced seeds. The Hebrew word here is zera (Strong's #H2233), which is most often translated \"descendants.\" This makes matters very difficult for the 24-hour interpretation. Not only do the plants sprout and grow to maturity, but produce seed or descendants. There are no plants capable of doing this within a 24-hour period of time. Things actually get worse for this interpretation. Genesis 1:12 clearly states that God allowed the earth to bring forth trees that bore fruit. The process by which the earth brings forth trees to the point of bearing fruit takes several years, at minimum. God did not create the trees already bearing fruit. The text states clearly that He allowed the earth to accomplish the process of fruit bearing through natural means. Because the process of the third day requires a minimum period of time of more than 24 hours, the Genesis text for the third day clearly falsifies the interpretation that the days of Genesis one are 24-hour periods of time. http://www.godandscience.org/youngearth/genesis.html",

Many believe that God created man through evolution (theistic evolution), and good debates rage on both sides of that issue. \n \n Regarding man, the main arguments for his alleged \"evolution\" hinge primarily on morpohological simularities with other hominids, which I think is highly inconclusive. For instance, the Neanderthal \"Man\" used to be (and in some circles still is) considered man's direct line ancestor. But DNA testing has precluded this in the specimens that were able to be tested. I think modern man is the \"Adam\" who was created. And he was to be created in the likeness and image of God. Important note for your consideration: Was Adam the first \"man\" created with an eternal spirit, like God? Did the other (previous) hominids not have an eternal spirit? If that's true, then there's no problem with the Genesis account of man's creation, IMO. Even today, there's not one specific hominid who has been conclusively shown, via genetic DNA testing, to have been man's direct line ancestor. It's primarily subjective morphological simularities that have been used to make the case of the \"family tree\" of man.",
