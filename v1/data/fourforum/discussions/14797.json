   "I'm new here and all. But I do know a thing or two about this issue. I'm a hunter and I've been following it closely in other avenues. I unfortunately can't post any links yet due to my new membership status though.\n \n \n\"Unfortunately, there is vocal opposition to any ammunition regulation from groups like the National Rifle Association and the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which see the campaign as an attack on hunting rights, and fear that the cost of non-lead ammunition would drive hunters away from the sport.\n\n \n This is very true. There are very few non-lead alternatives that can replicate the superior ballistics performances that lead offers. And the few that can replicate the same performance in a lab settings, can neither do it in a reliable and readily repeatable manner, nor can they be trusted to perform properly when out in the field.\n \n Even if they could, these materials are in no way comparable to the price of lead. As it is now good quality hunting ammunition can cost at the very least $1 a round. Add in new and foreign materials and the average sportsmen might be looking at a cost increase to $5 a round or more, which would effectively turn hunting into a privilege that only the richest could afford.\n \n And then you have to take into consideration what it would cost the factories to offer non-lead alternatives. The machines they have for making lead ammunition can't just be used to make bullets out of other materials, they're not set up for them. Tensile strengths and chemical properties aren't comparable or interchangeable with each other.\n \n \n\"But this campaign has nothing to do with revoking hunting rights; if it did, I would not be involved. It's an issue of using non-toxic materials. Was the removal of lead paint from children's toys a plot to do away with toys? Did the switch to unleaded gas hide an ulterior motive of removing vehicles from our roads?\n\n \n There's a slight difference though. Lead paint on children's toys could be licked off and ingested by toddlers who constantly put things in their mouths. Leaded gas exhaust fumes can easily be breathed in by anybody. But the lead used in bullets is neither breathed nor chewed. This isn't a proper or valid comparison to be making.\n \n \n\"And although copper bullets can be more expensive than lead ones, the cost of ammunition is a small fraction of what I spend on hunting, which includes gear, optics, food, gas and licenses.\"\n\n \n That's not a justifiable excuse to simply be calling for a ban on lead. The price increase is a small fraction? That's a small comfort. What exactly do you project the increase to be? Can you say with any certainty that we're talking about an increase in terms of cents rather than dollars per round?\n \n Where is the evidence that non-lead rounds can perform in a manner either comparable or superior to lead rounds in terms of performance, ballistics and function? Non-lead rounds very well could ruin a number of firearms that they're used in; that's why non-lead shot can't be used in older model shotguns when hunting waterfowl. If theses non-lead rounds irreversibly damage the rifle bores on older weapons there could be major lawsuits at be had because the matter wasn't properly researched.\n \n Furthermore, are you aware that a solid copper bullet could be considered armor-piercing in nature by the ATF due to the fact that it doesn't deform the same way lead does? Wouldn't that easily lead to a de-facto ban on the civilian possession of so-called \"armor piercing ammunition\"?\n \n And what about ammunition that's not used for hunting but instead personal defense? Should we also ban the use of lead for defensive ammunition because a mugger might suffer from lead poisoning in the course of a robbery attempt?\n \n \nOnce again, the NRA defends irresponsibility.\n\n \n You're claiming the NRA is defending irresponsibility, when the evidence for supporting a lead ammunition ban is without scientific backing and instead relies on emotional rhetoric from people who haven't studied out the issue? The claim that all lead is bad isn't scientific, nor is it accurate. Lead is natural and found everywhere. We as humans even have minute traces of lead in our blood regardless of our exposure to it; it's part of our chemical makeup. There's no such thing as \"lead free\" material, not even in solid brass or copper. The notion of a 100 percent pure metal that's free of any and all contaminants is a thing of fantasy, not reality. Even the gold in Fort Knox has minute traces of lead in it.\n \n Go to a sporting goods store, any sporting goods store, and look at the rifle cleaning kits. The ones that're made of brass have a disclaimer stating that the product contains lead and isn't eligible for sale in California.\n \n So who's more irresponsible? The hunting and sporting community that won't give into emotional nonsense without scientific standing or backing...or the people that're operating on the basis of \"all lead is bad, ban it now\" who have no evidence to support their argument in an educated debate?",

There are regulations restricting the kinds of material that can be used in pistol ammo that have nothing to do with safety and everything to do with the prejudice of anti-gun people. Take a look at the hysteria over the so-called cop killer bullets which have never been used to kill a police officer wearing a bullet resistant vest. The media does not care that those bullets were designed and intended for use by the police in the USA. The industry does a good job of regulating itself.\n \n The article you link to does not bother to cite any peer reviewed studies and expects us to take his/her word for it that lead is dangerous to wildlife. The author is a fool if he thinks that burying \"gut piles\" does anything to deter them being scavenged by other animals. Or does he take the time to use a backhoe and bury them six feet down or in a hole lined with concrete? I doubt it. \n \n It seems you do not shoot very much if your ammo budget is a small fraction of the cost of guns, optics and other accessories. I shoot thousands of rounds a year, nearly all of it reloads, a great majority of it is lead that does back into the ground; where it came from. I do not care to spend more than I already do unless I have a good reason to change. \n \n I reload, tumble clean brass and cast my own bullets; all of which results in the release of lead into the air. Despite this exposure, my organ and blood lead levels are well under OSHA permissible levels. The human body is a wonderful thing; it can protect itself from all kinds of environmental hazards\n \n How about some real data if you want people to take you seriously.\n \n Ranb",

   "What about shooting ranges and the secondary lead poisoning of children?\n\n \n Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. You started this thread to talk about the threat posed to the environment by lead ammunition used by hunters. Then when you're confronted with the evidence of how your position holds no water, you're suddenly performing an about face and going off on contamination at shooting ranges and lead exposure to children?\n \n How exactly do you make a jump from hunters, to shooting ranges and children being exposed to lead? I'm not seeing the logical progression here. Is there a post or something you left out and forgot to include? Is this one of those environmental extremist rants about how all lead is bad and should be done away with?\n \n \n\"Tragically, children&#8212;the gun industry&#8217;s prime target&#8212;are most vulnerable to the toxic effects of lead...\n\n \n How are children \"gun industry's prime target\" exactly? The laws on the federal and state level don't allow children to buy guns. In some states it's not even legal for children to handle the guns of their parents unless they first obtain a permit, which can't be issued until the minimum age of 18.\n \n Is there any evidence to back up this statement you're supporting? Maybe some source material released by an official firearms company directing their marking department to ramp up the sales release material to make them kid friendly and inspire children to become first time gun owners? Is there a memo or something we can see that would prove the existence of this notion?\n \n \n\"Parents often put their own children at risk, because they do not know that their visits to the local range can result in lead poisoning of the kids at home....\n\n \n I don't agree. I believe exposure to cigarette smoke and exhaust fumes put children more at risk than occasional encounters with minute traces of lead. And children are exposed to these carcinogenic-laced fumes almost every single day of their lives, at school and otherwise. The drive to school, to home, to the grocery store, to the pharmacy, to Wal-Mart, etc.\n \n \n\"Besides poisoning kids and others, shooting ranges are wrecking the environment at a prodigious pace:...\"\n\n \n I really don't believe that position. For starters this whole study you're presenting, in itself presents absolutely no scientific evidence to support itself as factual. We have a group of environmentalists -not the type of people who really rely on science or facts to begin with- claiming that lead is bad, but they don't go any further in depth than that. They're making wild accusations but they have no evidence of what they say.\n \n And while we're on the topic of the lack of validity this group has, let's look at some of the other nonsense they're claiming:\n \"Choked by stagnant markets and growing social disapproval, the gun industry has made increasing the number of shooting ranges the keystone of its survival strategy.\"\n Stagnant markets and social disapproval. I'm not seeing it. The number of people buying guns and taking part in the shooting sports is higher now than they ever have been. The number of background checks alone in the time leading up to Obama becoming president is proof of that.\n \"No children should be allowed at shooting ranges, nor should they\n participate in or be exposed to ammunition reloading, since there is no\n &#8220;safe&#8221; level of lead exposure for children.\"\n That's pretty extreme for a solution isn't it? No children allowed at shooting ranges? As in ever? What age qualifies as a child's age in a case like this? And does this include outdoor ranges with high levels of ventilation? Do we really need to believe that the possibility of lead exposure is so great that children need to basically be sealed away in plastic bubbles because it's for their own good? Lead is in the air no matter where you go, just as in everything else. There's no way to get away from it.\n \n Edited to add: And what about the exposure to lead children get from their parents? Anytime an adult goes to the range or reloads ammunition, according to your cited source, they'd come home with lead particles all over them. Should children have no exposure to their parents if they take part in the shooting sports? Should we have Child Social Services come in and take away the children of shooting parents and place them with non-shooting parents, because the exposure to minute traces of lead from shooting ranges and ammunition reloading is that much of a health hazard?\n \"Congress should forbid use of federal dollars for any range that permits use of assault weapons, high-capacity magazines, or machine guns.\"\n What exactly does this have to do with lead exposure and contamination issues? Especially when you look back on the original topic of this thread, which was contamination of the environment by hunters? If somebody wants to fire a specific amount of ammunition at any given time then they're going to do it, be it from an \"assault weapon\" or a bolt action rifle. I myself have been known to fire off a hundred or more rounds from a lever action rifle or a single action revolver. Give me a good day and I'll burn through an entire brick (500+ rounds) of plain lead rounds and not give a second thought about it.\n \n Was this \"no non-hunting guns\" thing thrown in there just because? Or is this an anti-gun group that's paired itself with environmental extremists?\n \"The Violence Policy Center...\"\n Oh so now we get down to the gist of the matter. The Violence Policy Center. We all know how neutral and professional they are. Not at all. Now everything makes sense. From the statement that children should never be allowed on shooting ranges or to handle ammunition, to the banning of use of so called \"assault weapons\" at shooting ranges.\n \n You almost had us up until that last little bit. And then we realized that you're cited source is just an extremist group that has made no attempt to ever hide the fact that it wants to do away with everything related to guns. And then when we saw that the Violence Policy Center was involved that all fell apart and we saw through your weak disguise.",

Experts from the\n Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers Institute (SAAMI), the\n organization founded in 1926 at the behest of the federal government and\n charged with establishing and publishing industry standards for safety,\n interchangeability, reliability and quality of ammunition, have been the\n most vocal in pointing out the myriad errors, omissions, misquotes and\n disinformation in Sorrell's opinion.\n The most outrageous and inaccurate claim mentioned in this report, and\n what some consider to be proof that the attorney general never did his\n homework on the issue, is language stating that lead in ammunition is\n absorbed by the skin and therefore not safe to handle. This allegation is\n unfounded and is serving to bolster claims by opposition groups that\n General Sorrell's report is nothing more than a scare tactic from a\n politician beholden to anti-gun and anti-hunting interests.\n \n \n Then you get on a rant about lead paint on childrens' toys trying to compare bullets to toys emoticon_xbouncer Paint is made from lead SALT compound, bullets are not!\n It turns out that the signed affidavit by the Environmental Quality officer stating that he had taken the water sample was a lie. Arwady never got to use his expert toxicology witness that metallic bullet never, ever leaches. It is not soluble. Only lead salts (such as found in lead paints) are dangerous.\n \n News Releases\n NSSF continues to stress the following in the debate over traditional ammunition:\n \n There is no scientific evidence that the use of traditional ammunition is having an adverse impact on wildlife populations. \n Wildlife management is the proper jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the 50 state wildlife agencies. \n A 2008 study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on blood lead levels of North Dakota hunters confirmed that consuming game harvested with traditional ammunition does not pose a human health risk. \n A ban on traditional ammunition would have a negative impact on wildlife conservation. The federal excise tax that manufacturers pay on the sale of the ammunition (11 percent) is a primary source of wildlife conservation funding. The bald eagle's recovery, considered to be a great conservation success story, was made possible and funded by hunters using traditional ammunition - the very ammunition organizations like the CBD are now demonizing. \n Recent statistics from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service show that from 1981 to 2006 the number of breeding pairs of bald eagles in the United States increased 724 percent. And much like the bald eagle, raptor populations throughout the United States are soaring. \n ",

I've never seen any kids around here digging through dirt piles in rural locations and chipping their teeth on Dodge Caravan wheels in order to find a hunk of lead to satisfy some strange hankering for bad tasting candy. Most of cases of lead poisoning I'm familiar with is from working with old car batteries with oxidized plates, inhaling soldering fumes, and local lead mine employees. (Which BTW have fewer instances of lead poisoning than solderers. GO FIGURE!)\n \n Wouldn't you think folks concerned with lead contamination would be concerned with areas where it is most likely to happen instead of creating some false crock of an environmental emergency about a tiny amount of non-bioavailable lead in some podunk dirt hill? (Evidently, dipping the lead in water supplies is fine, or else fishing weights would be addressed as well, correct?) Nope. Just bullets. Only lead bullets are bad. All other lead: fine.\n \n Oh, wait. That would mean being truthful about the actual concern instead of using it as a front to advance a particular agenda.

   "\"lead causes reduced IQ and attention span, hyperactivity, impaired growth, reading and learning disabilities\"\n \n Too much evidence of that on this board!\n\n \n Nobody is disputing the fact that lead has toxic side effects that need to be taken into consideration.\n \n However it has yet to be proven that lead ammunition contributes to any of these developmental issues. Instead you seem to be using the method of correlation/causation to try and make your argument. \"Lead causes these side effects, ammunition is made of lead, therefore hunters and shooters are causing these developmental issues and making them take place.\" However there's no scientific evidence available to back up this wild leap in logic.\n \n There are a large number of sources that can lead to lead exposure. Shooting is hardly the primary source. Lead can be found in tap water, leaded crystal, jewelry, old furniture, old houses, tainted supermarket food, batteries, plumbing from the 1950s, in the dirt, in the air, etc.\n \n Lead can be found anywhere you look if you're willing to look deep enough. As I explained to Galileo in previous posts it's impossible to completely rid ourselves of lead because there are minute traces of it in just about every single material. Even solid brass isn't really \"solid brass\" because it contains minute traces of lead in its structure. Look at the cleaning kits at the local sporting goods store and the ones that use brass rods will state that they contain minute traces of lead. I've seen it, I own several.\n \n And as I've explained to Galileo, I had plenty of exposure to lead while growing up. And despite the fact that I've been shooting since an early age I turned out just fine.\n \n The most common sources of lead exposure tend to deal with lead dust, not lead lumps. Refinishing old furniture, soldering jewelry, leaded crystal making, ceramics, construction and demolition, etc. all involve primary and secondhand exposure to lead dust in the air. So if you really care about the well being of children you might want to look into depriving furniture restorers of their parental rights.\n \n That right, I saw your post about how gun owners shouldn't be allowed around children. I saw it before you went back and deleted it. Thankfully Bryan caught you and it's now recorded for future reference.\n \n You wanna know something else that can cause impaired growth and other health issues? The various materials used in the construction of Styrofoam, plastic and rubber. Not to mention the chemical cocktails that various insecticides are made up of.\n \n Edited to add:\n \n If you really want to talk about health hazards from metals then how about we talk about aluminum? Aluminum causes a great deal of health issues, both neurological and physical. Or we could discuss the toxic nature of the chromium found in stainless steel that becomes released when it corrodes. And then there's good old fashioned iron, which isn't as flashy as lead when it comes to developmental issues, but a sufficient amount can cause permanent organ damage and outright death.",

Lead concentrations in soil samples from deeper horizons were at or near background values. The lead is mostly bound to iron and manganese oxides, carbonates, and organic matter.

That level for adults is 20 micrograms/deciliter of blood. In addition, 38 percent had lead levels elevated to at least 10 micrograms/ deciliter which is the level of concern for children. Fragmentation of the bullets led to approximately 30% higher blood lead levels in subjects who suffered a bone fracture in the torso associated with the gunshot wound.

   "It can happen:\n\n \n Nearly anything can happen. But \"can\" isn't good enough to be basing any arguments on. A child can quite possibly die if they choose to lick wet paint off the walls, but we haven't introduced new paint legislation to target irresponsible parents who engage in home decorating.\n \n The article you cite mentioned how doctors choose not to remove lead fragments if they don't cause severe damage to the body. That means the medical experts, the ones that are highly trained and qualified for knowing about health threats, don't believe that lead bullets are a serious enough health threat to warrant removing them from the human body unless serious injury has occurred in the first place.\n \n Doesn't that suggest something to you? If lead were as toxic as your previous examples would suggest, then any doctor who's concerned about remaining in business wouldn't hesitate to remove a lead bullet as quickly as possible. But since your latest article of choice states that the toxic nature doesn't warrant the surgery, then obviously you and the environmental extremists are choosing to blow the \"lead is poisonous\" argument beyond a rational point.\n \n I would like to thoroughly eviscerate you with your own article, it's shortcomings, and the things you failed to take into account.
