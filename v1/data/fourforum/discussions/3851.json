   "The posts above are correct in that evolution does not involve the origin of life. In fact, Darwin didn't even consider the origin of complex organs such as eyes as part of the theory. But, to play along, I'd like to address it anyway.\n \n Life didn't originate from \"nothing\". As I understand it (which may be admittedly flawed, so if anyone has a better understanding, just chime in), conditions in the pre-biotic Earth's atmosphere allowed for the formation of basic (inaminate) amino acids, proteins, and nucleotides in the oceans. A chance formation of a nucleotide that could duplicate itself marked the beginning of heredity. \n \n Some molecules \"survived\" longer than others because of their different formations. For example, nucleotides wrapped in protein shells would be more protected and last longer than those that had no shells. Thus, viral pre-organisms emerged and eventually formed bacteria. \n \n Conceptually, bacteria that work together could fill a niche. These cooperative bacteria started working together and eventually formed proto-cells. Furthering this logic, cells that work together could fill a niche, too, and so they formed tissues. You could apply a similar logic along the line until you get to a complex organism, such as an animal. \n \n Your third concern goes back to Darwin's avoidance of the problem of emergent features, and I think it is a valid criticism. Eyes and wings can't just pop-up out of nowhere. However, many of the phenotypes for animals are strikingly similar. For example, the same basic bones exist in a human arm as in a reptile's leg, a bird's wing, and a fish's fin. Their form is remarkably different, yet their similarities hint at similar origins. I suspect something similar happened with the development of emergent features (i.e., eyes), but the emergence was slow and so far in the past that its true origin is difficult to ascertain.",

The soil in your garden didn't turn into the trees and flowers. They came from seeds, cuttings, or grafts from other trees and flowers.\n\n I don't know what \"scientific laws\" have anything to do with it, but there are people doing research that is trying to figure out exactly what you are talking about, how life could have come from non-life. Of course, we'll never know how it happened exactly without a time machine, but certain people are working on ways to simulate what may have happened and synthesize self-sustaining reactions and self-replicating vescicle structures in attempts to mimic how life may have first started. \n \n One thing of interest is that a 3-carbon sugar has been spectroscopically identified in intersteller gas. If this reacts with formaldehyde (2 of them), fairly common in interstellar clouds as well, you get ribose. Miller-Urey showed that under certain conditions believed to exist on the early earth, you can get naturally occuring amino acids as well as purines and pyrimidines. There is a mineral called montmorillonite (comes in scoopable kitty litter). It was found that mont. surfaces catalyze the formation of RNA from individual nucletotides. Remarkably, the same mineral also catalyzes the formation of vesicles from a mixture of fatty acids. Put these all together and you have RNA inside a vesicle (a protocell?). Anyway, this is just part of the basis for this type of research, but I think it's a good illustration.\n http://www.rpi.edu/~straca/NSCORT/chem.html\n http://www.biomedcentral.com/news/20031024/02\n \n \n3 - There is no known scientific law that would allow one kind of creature to turn naturally into a completely different kind. Insects don't evolve into more complex non-insects for instance, because they don't have the genes to do it.\n\n You're right. An individual insect doesn't spin around and poof he's a dog. But, if you laid out individuals in a line, generation by generation, over a long period of time, there would be such small differences between generations that one couldn't tell the difference. If you then jumped from one generation to one born millions of years later, there may (or may not) be a discernable difference. One insect doesn't have the genes to become a dog, but over time, changes accumulate in the genome that a distant descendant may be quite different from it's distant predecessor, and it could even be a different species.",

Chemical evolution addresses the origin puzzle, so I suppose in a way you're right: evolutionary theory, as a whole, could be seen as inclusive of life's origins, while natural selection (which I guess could be called a \"speciation\" subsection of the holistic evolutionary theory) involves only the changes and origins of species.",

It makes no difference how that life got there, if it self organized (a la abiogenesis) doesn't matter, evolution happened, if God (or Zeus or Odin or whatever god exists) magically zapped it into existance, doesn't matter, evolution happened.

So at least we have evidence (slim evidence, to be sure) that the universe could have began uncaused, it could have spontaneously popped into existance.

Seems to me the only reason you assert this is because you want to be right, not because you have any evidence....

We have made great strides in understanding our universe, the big bang theory is a reasonable explaination for the evidence we've observed so far.

   "1 - There is no scientific law that allows something to evolve from nothing. If there was nothing in the universe to begin with, obviously nothing could happen to cause anything to appear. \n\n \n There are no laws that prevent it.\n All scientific laws we currently have identified support evolution.\n \n \n2 - No scientific law can account for non-living things' coming to life. The soil in your garden didn't turn into the trees and flowers. They came from seeds, cuttings, or grafts from other trees and flowers.\n\n What is this talk of scientific laws not accounting for things?\n No scientific law states that molectules of non-living things cannot become what we call molecules that are organized into life. It's all the same atmos and energy, there is simply no reason NOT to believe life comes from what it comes from, literally.\n \n \n3 - There is no known scientific law that would allow one kind of creature to turn naturally into a completely different kind. Insects don't evolve into more complex non-insects for instance, because they don't have the genes to do it.\n\n \n 3rd fallacy of trying to use scientific law as evidence of something that is not logical. There is no scientific law that disagrees with the notion that complex life, of course, came from more simple life forms. Actually, evolution is a proven mechanism for one classifcation of life becoming another classification of life. The preponderance of evidence is such that when you deny it, you admit your ignorance and of course, cannot present sufficient evidence to disprove evolution.\n \n These are arguments from ignorance, nothing more.\n \n -Mach",

You didn't bother to name your source, so your quotes are worthless (as is your reasoning ability.)\n So let me quote from a real, scientific source, from here:\n Berkeley \n \n \"Contrary to popular belief, ideas about the origin of life are not cornerstones of evolutionary theory. Evolutionary theory is really only concerned with how life evolved after its origin. It does not hinge on the details of that origin. Whenever, wherever, and however life originated, it then began to evolve.\"\n \n So it's obvious you have no idea what you're talking about......The formation of life from non life is not part of the theory of evolution nor is evolution contingent on how life first arose. Every real biologist knows this, it's only the uniformed who try unsuccessfully to assert it. Do yourself a favor and learn a little about what the theory of evolution REALLY says.\n \n \nWhat evolution fails to prove is how life evolved from lifeless bacteria with nothing else around into a tree of complex and intelligent life.\n \n \n Yes, and the theory of gravity fails to prove how life evovled from lifeless bacteria (lifeless bacteria?!?!?) with nothing else around into a tree of complex and intelligent life! And let's not forget the heliocentric theory, it must be wrong because it fails to prove how life evovled from lifeless bacteria (lifeless bacteria?!?!) with nothing else around into a tree of complex and intelligent life......Like I said, get a clue.",
