Math and science are hardly emphasised anymore. Most highschools don't even require 3 years of science. Some of the best private college prep schools don't require 4 years of math nor science. We simply are not teaching science nor its method of thinking to our students. Supersport himself is a excellent example of this. He doesn't understand anything. Furthermore, the states with the poorer performing public school systems have higher percentages of literal creationists. While that does not mean that is the cause, it can't help but be noticed. And then there's the problem of creationists deliberately lying to the public. The whole notion of evolution as controversial in the scientific community is a giant lie propagadated by creationists organizations like the Discovery Insitute. A simple check of the Steve List proves that. \n \n So we have a poor education system that allows charlantans to lead them astray. Only in the US is literal creationism taken seriously.

How exactly is this helping your claim that skull fossils slightly different to those of humans cannot be from genetically related ancestors?\n \n \nOn what grounds do you have to say that the homo habilis -- or any other skull is transitional?\n\n \n Strictly speaking, we're not. We're saying evolutionary theory predicts that if a modern species is related to an ancient, extinct species, we should be able to find fossilised remains with intermediate characteristics. These fossils do not necessarily belong to direct ancestors; they are quite likely to belong to extinct offshoots of the same branch leading from the ancient species to the modern one.\n \n So we look at the fossil record, and what do we find? A sequence of skulls which, when arranged in chronological order of the age of rocks in which they were found, clearly show a smooth morphological progression: precisely the intermediate characteristics evolutionary theory predicts.\n \n Does this prove evolution? Again, the question kind of misses the point. Evolutionary theory made a prediction, which is confirmed in spades by observable fossil evidence. That's good evidence that evolutionary theory accurately models reality. When enough such evidence piles up, we make the judgement call that it constitutes 'proof'.\n \n If Creationism were a real science, it would have predicted that no fossils with characteristics intermediate between human and ape would be found - and would have looked very stupid indeed when they were. Indeed, if Creationism were a real science, it would have predicted that no fossils would be observed at all, and looked even more stupid. It is no coincidence, therefore, that Creationism is very careful never to make predictions. It doesn't need to, because the objective of creationism is not to advance knowledge by predicting things that can be tested and confirmed, but rather to produce a steady, unrelenting stream of apologies for why reality fails to conform to biblical dogma. Creationism never says anything until something is observed, at which point - no matter what is observed, be it a 12-billion-year-old quasar, protocells spontaneously emerging in the laboratory, or a sequence of umpteen fossil skulls with transitional characteristics between ape and man - it comes up with some half-assed and dishonest pseudo-explanation for why it doesn't really mean what it looks like it means.\n \n I mean, let's be realistic here: if you weren't utterly stoned on bible-juice, and were shown that series of skulls, along with the information that they were found in progressively younger rock formations, you'd come up with the theory of evolution yourself.

To prove this statement you'd have to prove that there is a smooth lineage between australopithecus and homo erectus. You'd also have to give SOME sort of fossil evidence prior to 2 million years ago. You'd also have to give some sort of fossil evidence for chimps -- which there is none. You'd also have to give me some common ancestor bones -- there are none.\n \n \n If Creationism were a real science, it would have predicted that no fossils with characteristics intermediate between human and ape would be found - and would have looked very stupid indeed when they were. \n \n there are none. show me....I'm begging you...PLEASE just do one thing -- show me.\n \n \n Indeed, if Creationism were a real science, it would have predicted that no fossils would be observed at all, and looked even more stupid. \n \n the only thing here that is stupid is this statement.\n \n It is no coincidence, therefore, that Creationism is very careful never to make predictions. It doesn't need to, because the objective of creationism is not to advance knowledge by predicting things that can be tested and confirmed, but rather to produce a steady, unrelenting stream of apologies for why reality fails to conform to biblical dogma.\n \n such as?\n \n \n  Creationism never says anything until something is observed, at which point - no matter what is observed, be it a 12-billion-year-old quasar, protocells spontaneously emerging in the laboratory, or a sequence of umpteen fossil skulls with transitional characteristics between ape and man - it comes up with some half-assed and dishonest pseudo-explanation for why it doesn't really mean what it looks like it means.\n \n I will agree that creationists don't generally make predictions, but we are not in the business of trying to figure out a way the world was formed without a Creator -- thus to go through some conveluted scientific explanation is going against what we stand for.\n \n I mean, let's be realistic here: if you weren't utterly stoned on bible-juice, and were shown that series of skulls, along with the information that they were found in progressively younger rock formations, you'd come up with the theory of evolution yourself.

   "Creationism is not science. It is not supposed to be. Creation is a belief system based upon faith. Science is based upon facts, data, theory and conjecture. God cannot be proven or disproven. If he could, what would be the value of faith?\n \n The difference between science and Faith is that when an element of science is disproved, the rest of the system may be adjusted accordingly. This is absent from a faith based system which relies upon the inerrant word of God. Thus, you find pockets of faith which insist that the world is a few thousand years old, that dinosaurs never existed, and that light predates the creation of the sun.\n \n Regarding the fossil record. Go out without the benefit of guides or any reference and find me the skull of a French Nobleman who lived in the 1500s. Unless you knew exactly where to look, your chances of finding Pierre are remote, yet you do not doubt that members of the French Nobility once roamed the face of the Earth. Now traipse back millions of years. Not only are the remains much more difficult to come by, the preservation process must be precise to produce the record you are looking for. The wonder is not that we have not found a complete record, but that we have found anything at all. While your at it, find me a skeleton from about 4,000 years ago, say of Methuselah or Enoch that shows 700 years of age as described in Genesis. There are none. show me....I'm begging you...PLEASE just do one thing -- show me. Surely it would be easier to find a 4,000 year old skeleton of a Methselahesque ancient than a protohuman millions of years previous. \n \n Interestingly, while the dearth of transitional fossils are cited by creationists as evidence of creationism, when you ask a creationist to explain the dearth of skeletal remains reminiscent of modern development, there is silence, then stammering. \n \n Faith told Galileo that the Earth was the center of the Universe. Science allowed Edmund Halley to predict the return of the eponymous comet. The difference between faith and science is that science admits that it does not know all the answers. Science itself is an evolution of thought.",

   "There are not intermediate characteristics found in apes. Period. There are humans (evolutionists call the old ones homo erectus and Neanderthals) and there are apes. There is NOTHING in between.\n\n \n Then please, you explain what we're seeing in the hominids2.jpg linked earlier. (A) is a modern ape skull, to which (B) is very similar. It is also very similar to (C), which is in turn very similar to (D), and so forth until we reach a modern human skull. \n \n \n So we look at the fossil record, and what do we find? A sequence of skulls which, when arranged in chronological order of the age of rocks in which they were found, clearly show a smooth morphological progression: precisely the intermediate characteristics evolutionary theory predicts.\n \n \nThat is just false. To prove this statement you'd have to prove that there is a smooth lineage between australopithecus and homo erectus.\n\n \n No; you simply don't get it. Evolutionary theory made a prediction, that we would find fossils with intermediate characteristics. We did; the prediction is therefore confirmed. End of story. It would be nice if we could actually establish lineage, but as I've already said, those skulls could just as easily represent side-shoots of the branch linking us to our common ancestor with chimps.\n \n \nYou'd also have to give SOME sort of fossil evidence prior to 2 million years ago.\n\n \n Thankfully there's plenty. \n \n \nYou'd also have to give some sort of fossil evidence for chimps -- which there is none.\n\n \n Oh, if only that were true. The scarcity of fossils representing certain species is usually due to them inhabiting areas unsuited to fossil formation. Chimps are forest-dwelling creatures, an environment chronically unsuited to preserving traces of ancestral species.\n \n \nYou'd also have to give me some common ancestor bones -- there are none.\n\n \n I don't have to give you any such thing, but I tell you what: while I'm off looking for them, why don't you go and dig up ol' Adam and Eve? Because I'm sorry, without their bones on a table in front of me - preferably signed by god, I see no reason to believe they existed :)\n \n \nthere are none. show me....I'm begging you...PLEASE just do one thing -- show me.\n\n \n Go back a page and click on the hominids2.jpg again. Take a long, hard look at it, observing how strikingly similar each skull is to the skulls either side. I know this might be a bit technical, but when something in the middle looks halfway between the things either side, that's what we like to call 'intermediate characteristics'.\n \nIndeed, if Creationism were a real science, it would have predicted that no fossils would be observed at all, and looked even more stupid. \n \n the only thing here that is stupid is this statement.\n\n \n Why? Starting from a literal interpretation of biblical creationism, would you 'predict' that we would find rocks hundreds of millions of years old or that encased within them we would find the fossilised remains of living creatures? Of course not! You would predict the observation of evidence indicating the world was a few thousand years old.\n \n Honestly now, how do you think people came up with the idea that the earth was billions of years old and that life evolved over a large chunk of that period? Answer: they looked at the world around them. It's that simple.\n \n \nbut rather to produce a steady, unrelenting stream of apologies for why reality fails to conform to biblical dogma.\n \n such as?\n\n \n Pick a page.\n \n \nI will agree that creationists don't generally make predictions, but we are not in the business of trying to figure out a way the world was formed without a Creator\n\n \n Oh, you were so nearly right, but you used three words too many. You are not in the business of trying to figure out a way the world was formed.\n \n Science, on the other hand, is, and the simple fact is the world tells a very different story from the one you've been fed by the well-meaning folks who brought you up.\n \n I mean, let's be realistic here: if you weren't utterly stoned on bible-juice, and were shown that series of skulls, along with the information that they were found in progressively younger rock formations, you'd come up with the theory of evolution yourself. And you would find ample supporting evidence.\n \n prove it, buddy. I'm waiting.[/QUOTE]\n \n And you'll always be waiting, because it doesn't matter how much evidence there is to support the theory of common descent (the statistical significance of the phylogenetic tree alone is mind-boggling), you will always shift and change your demands for proof to something science either has not or cannot conceivably provide. There will always be wriggle room for intellectual cowards.",
