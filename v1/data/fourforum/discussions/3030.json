   "I am appalled that people continue to accuse Bush of not denouncing the Swift Boat ads. Max Cleland came out and told Bush to \"put up or shut up\" and told him to denounce the ads. Just to clear up any controversy, Bush did specifically denounce the Swift Boat Vet ads. He said on Monday:\n \n Q That's okay. Some Republicans such as Bob Dole and some Republican donors such as Bob Perry have contributed and endorsed the message of these 527 Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ads -- \n THE PRESIDENT: Right. \n \n Q Do you -- when you say that you want to stop all -- \n \n THE PRESIDENT: All of them. \n \n Q Does that mean -- \n \n THE PRESIDENT: That means that ad, every other ad. \n \n Q Would you encourage Republicans not to give to -- \n \n THE PRESIDENT: Absolutely. I don't think we ought to have 527s. I can't be more plain about it. And I wish -- I hope my opponent joins me in saying, condemning these activities of the 527s. It's the -- I think they're bad for the system. That's why I signed the bill, McCain-Feingold. I've been disappointed that for the first six months of this year, 527s were just pouring tons of money, billionaires writing checks. And I spoke out against them early. I tried to get others to speak out against them, as well. And I just don't -- I think they're bad for the system. \n \n \n \n He said, \"That means that ad\". How does that not constitute denouncing the Swift Boat vet ad specifically? If John Kerry and Max Cleland want him to denounce this (which they claim is a lie), I want them to condemn all of Dean's (he claims that Bush knew about 9/11 before it happened, which is a lie), Kennedy's (he claims Bush is a thug and he concocted a war in Texas, which is a lie), Harkin's (he claims that Cheney is a coward because he didn't spill any blood in a war), MoveOn.org's (they equate Bush with Hitler, they say his father got him in the Air National Guard, etc which are all lies), and Michael Moore's (he claims Bush is a liar, did business with Bin Laden, he aided the Taliban, flew the Bin Ladens out of the country before anyone else could fly out, etc, which are all lies) comments/ads/movies. It is only fair to ask that.",

He has denounced ALL of the ads before, which last time I checked all included the SBVFT. Then he specifically denounced it, and you claim he didn't. What more do you want...do you want him to write it out on a piece of paper? I haven't heard Kerry denounce any of the ads or people who are lying about Bush \"specifically\". What do you have to say about that? And what other ad would he be talking about? The only ad Kerry is asking him to \"specifically\" denounce is the SBVFT ad.",
