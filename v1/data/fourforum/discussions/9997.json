   "http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5580343,00.html\n \n The best parking spots allocated to 'green' drivers, charging even more for trash pick-up, charging more for electricity use, etc. It doesn't sound like the city govt. did much to hear from the citizens of the city over all this. The place is starting to sound more like the U.S.S.R. than a U.S. city. If I were living in Denver, I might have to seriously consider leaving. I also thought it was interesting the article says the city doesn't charge for trash pick-up. Do they not realize it's being charged for in the form of taxes?\n \n This is what so many people are concerned about when it comes to the global warming scare. Yeah, of course things are getting warmer; everyone knows that. But until we know for certain that it's not because of natural causes, it's ridiculous to start penalizing people. If more cities start pulling these sorts of stunts, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a mass-change of people moving out to countrysides, out of the cities over the next few decades. But at least it's not being imposed by the federal govt, so people still have a choice to live under those laws or not by moving or staying.",

   "jyoshu, I'd simply point out that scientists are in almost total agreement (you will always have a few fringys) that Global Warming is (1) occurring and (2) humans are a major contributing factor. Now we have the tools that we need to fix the problem.\n \n Listed below is what Denver is doing according to the website jyoushu gave us:\n \u0095Making heavy users of electricity and natural gas pay more\n \u0095Charging residents who throw away a lot of trash\n \u0095 Setting energy-efficiency standards for new construction\n \u0095 Giving carpoolers and hybrids priority for parking \n \n It sounds to me that they are saying \"there is a serious problem and we need to change the way we act.\" It shows vision, it asks for sacrifice, and it both punishes abusers and rewards those who successfully change their behavior. These ideas are not only practical, but also easy to implement. From a \"what can i do\" perspective I like the idea. My family is currently preparing to purchase a hybrid car and looking into solar panels for our house. Not only are solar panels good for the environment, but they also save you a hell of a lot on energy! Again, you may see them as communist, but I instead see it as a good vision of a true American leader. Pull up the your sleeves and get to work! That's the American spirit.",

   "jyoushu, no, i have to disagree with you. Most scientists fully agree that humans are a major contributing factor. I remember it being bounced in the news that the major scientific community (basically the ABA of scientists) released findings with strong language to the effect of both one and two. Now, i'll grant you they don't say they are 100% sure of it, but for scientists they use pretty strong language. You just have to understand where they are coming from. \n \n Oh, and yes I understand that they are making it mandatory. I see global warming as a real threat. To counteract this threat we [society] must change some of our habits, and this is a good way to get habits to change. Unlike you, I have faith in the government, having been a public servant. You see, when people are acting in a negative manner, I believe that government is the way you get them to correct it, or at least one of many different available ways.",

   "Actually, the DA's office I worked in had a murder trial going on. I watched national news several months ago and they claimed that up to a 20 bodies were found in the yard... I asked at our office and they were like ###? We have NO idea where they got that number. Our own investigators say it was more like 4-6.\n \n In my experience the media often gets things in government wrong. I looked back at the report (as they did give a citation) and confirmed the information myself. As for government propaganda, you often find the ways to read between the lines and figure it out for yourself. You also learn to appreciate the other side because, most of the time, they have convictions that are just as honest and strong as yours... they just happen to be wrong ;). You disagree with them, you fight with them, sometimes you scream at them and they scream back, but at the end of the day, professionalism is able to shake hands, laugh it off, and say good job, let's get a beer.

   "upon re-reviewing document I would direct your attention to page three, the charts show cyclical change, and then what has been happening recently seemingly far out of the cyclical norm.\n \n Further supported by \n \n \nThe atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide in 2005 exceeds by far the natural range over the last 650,000 years (180 to 300 ppm) as determined from ice cores. The annual carbon dioxide concentration growth-rate was larger during the last 10 years (1995 - 2005 average: 1.9 ppm per year), than it has been since the beginning of continuous direct atmospheric measurements (1960 - 2005 average: 1.4 ppm \n per year)\n\n \n The base line conclusion relevant here is:\n \n \nThe understanding of anthropogenic warming and cooling influences on climate has improved since the Third Assessment Report (TAR), leading to very high confidence(7) that the globally averaged net effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of warming, with a radiative forcing of 1.6 [+0.6 to +2.4] W m-2. \n\n \n Foot note seven says:\n \n \n \n In this Summary for Policymakers the following levels of confidence have been used to express expert judgments on the correctness of the \n underlying science: very high confidence at least a 9 out of 10 chance of being correct; high confidence about an 8 out of 10 chance of being \n correct. \n\n \n Further flushing out what my concerns are:\n \n \n \u0095 New data since the TAR now show that losses from the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica have very likely contributed to sea level rise over 1993 to 2003. Flow speed has increased for some Greenland and Antarctic outlet glaciers, which drain ice from the interior of the ice sheets. The corresponding increased ice sheet mass loss has often followed thinning, reduction or loss of ice shelves or loss of floating glacier tongues. Such dynamical ice loss is sufficient to explain most of the Antarctic net mass loss and approximately half of the Greenland net mass loss. The remainder of the ice loss from Greenland has occurred because losses due to melting have exceeded accumulation due to snowfall. \n \u0095 Global average sea level rose at an average rate of 1.8 [1.3 to 2.3] mm per year over 1961 to 2003. The rate was faster over 1993 to 2003, about 3.1 [2.4 to 3.8] mm per year. Whether the faster rate for 1993 to 2003 reflects decadal variability or an increase in the longer-term trend is unclear. There is high confidence that the rate of observed sea level rise increased from the 19th to the 20th century. The total 20th century rise is estimated to be 0.17 [0.12 to 0.22] m. \n\n \n Finally page 9 lists dangers of global warming, and the lowest level it has for the option of \"Likelihood of a human contribution to observed trend\" is \"More likely than not.\" That is, greater than 51%. The only reason that t is not higher is stated in footnote f, \"Magnitude of anthropogenic contributions not assessed. Attribution for these phenomena based on expert judgment rather \n than formal attribution studies.\" In other words, we have no formal proof yet, but our best guess of the experts based on preliminary data is...\n \n conclusion I draw, humans are probably a cause, let us alleviate as much of the problem as we can!",
