   "NRA-ILA :: Why NRA Opposes Gun Control Supporters' \"Terrorist Watchlist\" Bills\n \n \nBackground Checks/ NICS \n Why NRA Opposes Gun Control Supporters' \"Terrorist Watchlist\" Bills \n \n Some believe that S.1317 (Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.) and H.R.2159 (Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y.) are intended to prevent &#8220;terrorists&#8221; from buying guns. Here&#8217;s what the bills really propose:\n \n That a person who is not otherwise prohibited from buying a firearm, and who therefore would otherwise pass a National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) check, could still be prohibited from acquiring a firearm if he is on the FBI&#8217;s watchlist. \n That once a person is told that he is on the watchlist, he would be subject to a 10-year prison sentence for a gun already possessed, even if he has been placed on the watchlist by mistake, or for a minor or unsubstantiated reason. \n That a person who goes to court to challenge his placement on the watchlist would not be informed of the specific suspicions or allegations upon which his watchlisting is based. \n That the person&#8217;s challenge to his watchlisting would be decided by a judge, not a jury. \n That the judge would not be allowed to consider all of the available evidence.\n Objections to the Bills\n \n As the name suggests, the &#8220;watchlist&#8221; is not limited to people guilty of &#8220;terrorism&#8221;1 or who are suspected of other acts serious enough to warrant their arrest. It broadly includes people &#8220;known or reasonably suspected to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism,&#8221;2 including those only &#8220;being preliminarily investigated to determine whether they have links to terrorism&#8221; and those &#8220;for whom the FBI does not have an open terrorism investigation.&#8221;3 \n A person accused of serious wrongdoing has the right to know what he has been accused of, to offer evidence in his defense, and to be judged by a jury. A constitutionally protected right cannot be taken away on the basis of a secretive or unsubstantiated accusation. A judge should be allowed to consider evidence which may support the innocence of the accused. \n S. 1317 and H.R. 2159 are aimed primarily at law-abiding American gun owners. Ninety-five percent of watchlisted persons are already prohibited from acquiring firearms in the U.S., because they are not U.S. citizens or legal resident aliens. (See below.) \n NICS already checks the relevant portion of the watchlist, and denies firearms to watchlisted persons who are prohibited from possessing firearms. Tellingly, S. 1317&#8217;s and H.R. 2159&#8217;s sponsors could not name a single gun crime committed by a watchlisted person who purchased a firearm after passing a NICS check. (See below.) \n As D.C.&#8217;s and Chicago&#8217;s handgun bans have proven, prohibiting the possession of firearms doesn&#8217;t stop criminals from illegally acquiring them. \n There would be an enormous potential for abuse, if the FBI were given arbitrary power over a constitutionally-protected right. This would be true even if the FBI had an unblemished record where civil rights are concerned.\n\n This might make me sound fanatical, but I agree with the NRA on this one. I think it's ridiculous to restrict people from buying guns because they might be terrorists. That's like denying someone the right to buy condoms because they might be a rapist.\n \n And this might sound paranoid, but considering how left the current administration is and how paranoid they are about right wing \"extremism,\" I have doubts about their definition of a \"terrorist.\"",

   "Second Amendment challenges aside, these bills violate numerous other provisions of the Bill of Rights. See the following:\n \n Amendment Five:\n No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\n \n Amendment Six:\n In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.\n \n Amendment Eight:\n Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\n \n Suspending a person's constitutional rights because of suspicion isn't acceptable or tolerable. Anybody who supports these bills should be prosecuted on charges of treason.\n \n We always hear about liberals talking about the evils of vigilante justice, people acting outside of the law and deciding to take matters into their own hands, legal or not. Well this bill does nothing more but endorse vigilante justice by suspending the need for law where the feds are concerned.",
