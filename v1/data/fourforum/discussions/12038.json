   "Saturday, November 29, 2008\n AP\n NEW YORK - Police were reviewing video from surveillance cameras in an attempt to identify people who trampled on a Wal-Mart worker killed when a crowd of post-Thanksgiving shoppers burst through the doors at a suburban store and knocked him down.\n \n Criminal charges were still possible, but identifying anyone in the store's videos may prove difficult, said Nassau County police spokesman Detective Lt. Michael Fleming on Friday.\n \n Other workers were trampled as they tried to rescue the man, and customers stepped over him and became irate when officials said the store was closing because of the death, police and witnesses said.\n \n At least four other people, including a woman who was eight months pregnant, were taken to hospitals for observation or minor injuries, and the store in Valley Stream on Long Island closed for several hours. It reopened shortly after 1 p.m.\n \n Police said about 2,000 people were gathered outside the Wal-Mart doors before its 5 a.m. opening at a mall about 20 miles east of Manhattan. The impatient crowd knocked the employee, identified by police as Jdimytai Damour of Queens, to the ground as he opened the doors, leaving a metal portion of the frame crumpled like an accordion.\n \n \"This crowd was out of control,\" said Fleming, who described the scene as \"utter chaos.\"\n \n Dozens of store employees trying to fight their way out to help Damour were also getting trampled by the crowd, Fleming said. Witnesses said that even as the worker lay on the ground, shoppers streamed into the store, stepping over him.\n \n Kimberly Cribbs, who witnessed the stampede, said shoppers were acting like \"savages.\"\n \n \"When they were saying they had to leave, that an employee got killed, people were yelling, 'I've been on line since yesterday morning,\"' she said. \"They kept shopping.\"\n \n The 28-year-old pregnant woman was taken to a hospital, where she and the baby were reported to be OK, said police Sgt. Anthony Repalone. At least three other people were taken to hospitals with minor injuries.\n \n \n http://http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,459068,00.html\n\n \n How idiotic can people get? I hope they are able to identify every one of the XXXXXX that caused this and charge them all with manslaughter. People seem to get a little more rediculous every year. \n \n I especially like the fact that people will sit in line in front of a Wal-Mart on Thanksgiving day to be among the first in line when it opens on Friday.",

It has occured with China, N. Korea, Cuba, the USSR, etc. The difference is that historically they have rioted over things like food, shelter, medicine, and clothing. This can easily be understood, if not even condoned. Sadly, some people here in the US are willing to trample others for items likke DVD payers, video games, and children's toys. While I agree that capitalism has allowed people to enojy a standard of living where the majority of people have enough essentials and can afford to go out and buy these non-essential items, I cannot understand blaming capitalism for this human behavior. It would be like blaming the grocery store for making people fat. It comes down to individual responsibility. The grocery store provides people the means to get fat, but the individual must make the conscious choice to buy and consume the products. Likewise, people must choose to engage in such abominable behavior. \n \n I think it is foolish projection to blame this abhorent animal behavior on capitalism.",

   "Monsieur O'Neill muses on environmentalism:\n \nIn Australia, governments have adopted environmental education programs that teach children that human intrusion into nature is to be condemned and that man's life must be subordinated to the preservation of nature, by government force if necessary. Under this view, nature is not to be preserved for the benefit of man, but rather, it is to be preserved for its own sake against the encroachments of man. This is the philosophy of environmentalism, and the standard viewpoint of environmentalists, according to philosopher Michael Berliner:\n\n Teaching Kids about the Environment, Government Style - Ben O'Neill - Mises Institute\n \n So, it appears that Monsieur O'Neill makes the claim that this Michael Berliner person speaks for all environmentalists when Monsieur Berliner makes the claim:\n \nNature, they insist, has \"intrinsic value,\" to be revered for its own sake, irrespective of any benefit to man. As a consequence, man is to be prohibited from using nature for his own ends. Since nature supposedly has value and goodness in itself, any human action which changes the environment is necessarily branded as immoral. Environmentalists invoke this argument from intrinsic value not against lions that eat gazelles or beavers that fell trees; they invoke it only against man, only when man wants something. The environmentalists' concept of intrinsic value is nothing but the desire to destroy human values.\n\n And Monsieur Berliner tries to diminish the issues of environmental concerns to the simplistic and rather ridiculous equation:\n \nHuman values vs. the intrinsic value of nature.\n\n The problem is that human values may be highly invested in the intrinsic value of nature and we do not yet thoroughly understand the natural world which surrounds us and nurtures us.\n \n I am an environmentalist because of my intrinsic interest in my own welfare. I can perceive that I exist because of a very delicately balanced network of other life forms and the basic resources of good air, good water and rich and abundant soil for growing my food. When human tampering mucks up one of these resources, including the network of other life forms, I might cease to exist before my time to do so because of human blundering. My self-interest commands that I look out for my own interests and that impels me to insist that we must know more about our natural surroundings before we take any drastic actions.",

   "Jefferson's estate:\n \nJefferson died on the Fourth of July, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. He died a few hours before the death of John Adams, his compatriot in their quest for independence, then great political rival, and later friend and correspondent. Adams is often rumored to have referenced Jefferson in his last words, unaware of his passing.\n \n Although he was born into one of the wealthiest families in the United States, Thomas Jefferson was deeply in debt when he died.\n \n Jefferson's trouble began when his father-in-law died, and he and his brothers-in-law quickly divided the estate before its debts were settled. It made each of them liable for the whole amount due - which turned out to be more than they expected.\n \n Jefferson sold land before the American Revolution to pay off the debts, but by the time he received payment, the paper money was worthless amid the skyrocketing inflation of the war years. Cornwallis ravaged Jefferson's plantation during the war, and British creditors resumed their collection efforts when the conflict ended. Jefferson was burned again when he co-signed notes for a relative who reneged on debts in the financial Panic of 1819. Only Jefferson's public stature prevented creditors from seizing Monticello and selling it out from under him during his lifetime.\n \n After his death, his possessions were sold at auction. In 1831, Jefferson's 552 acres (223 hectares) were sold for $7,000 to James T. Barclay. Thomas Jefferson is buried on his Monticello estate, in Charlottesville, Virginia. In his will, he left Monticello to the United States to be used as a school for orphans of navy officers. His epitaph, written by him with an insistence that only his words and \"not a word more\" be inscribed, reads:\n\n Thomas Jefferson - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

This opinion piece from the Guardian highlights some of the crowd control research that applies in this situation:\n Crush that was waiting to happen | Science | The Guardian\n \n The key point, I think, is not that human beings have got any worse, just that capitalism focuses desire on the material, so the desire for material goods is heightened to a level where it becomes the sole focus.\n\n \n \n \n MY GOD I LOVE YOU JO!
