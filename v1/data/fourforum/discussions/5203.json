   "I've been doing some additional research on the al-Libbi matter and it is indeed a strange story. The Times of London seems to be the news source most adament that he was not a big catch. But in reading other sources it gets stranger yet. One story is that the \"real\" big fish was caught some weeks earlier and has been thoroughly pumped for information and that this \"fake\" little fish is just a diversion to throw bin Laden off balance. What seems to be factual and undenied is that Pakistan is the custodial jailer of this or both individuals and they usually will release these Al Queda types to the U.S. but not in this particular case. Why is that? So the bottom line is that I don't know for a certainty. Are they just covering up their own incompetency or are they putting one or both of these through the torture chamber; something we can't do under our laws?\n \n On the latest story it does appear that this latest creep did in fact get his date with his 72 virgins. But in the crazy news cycle who knows for sure?\n ---------------------------------------------\n This is the link to the Newsweek story on \"al-Libbi.\" It is the May 16, issue, although that would have been written prior to that date. Isikoff is a pretty good reporter and was the one who would have broken the Clinton/Monica story had Drudge not jumped on it first.\n \n It also seems to answer why \"al-Libbi\" hasn't been turned over to the U.S. \n \n http://msnbc.msn.com/id/7775421/site/newsweek/",
