   "Eminent domain, the PC phrase for government seizing private property, has been in force for as long as I can remember. Very political, normally driven by private sector money and 'urban renewal' federal grants, usually in tandem. The standard procedure is offering below market value price, government condemnation when rejected, a lengthy lawsuit by original owners against the government entity to recover value with the intent to break those private parties with legal costs and duration. Another common variation is the government entity acting in solo for urban renewal with construction contracts going to favored political contributors and using public bond issues to enlarge and sweeten the deal.

   "While this is a pretty awful decision, it's not terribly activist, or surprising in light of a previous decision by the Supreme Court.\n \n Lets start at the beginning.\n \n Poletown Neighborhood Council v. City of Detroit, 304 N.W.2d 455 (Mich. 1981) was a case where GM wanted a large area to build a new plant (which is now abandoned) in downtown Detroit, or they would leave Michigan. If you know anything about the state of Michigan, especially Detroit, you know it's dependent upon auto manufacturing. The state had no choice, and changed the constitutional definition of \"public use\" into \"public good,\" allowing the state to take the land, then sell it (at a huge discount) to GM.\n \n Several states responded in kind, and in a particularly awful decision, Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229 (1984), the Supreme Court ruled that \"public good\" was a legitimate \"public use\" under the fifth amendment. Note that in the Hawaii case, the state forced large landowners to break up their land and sell it to the state; who turned around and sold it to the tenants who had been living on the land. No doubt about it, this was a redistribution scheme.\n \n Fortunately, Michigan came to its senses in County of Wayne v. Hathcock, 684 NW2d 765, 786-87 (Mich. 2004) when it changed its mind and reversed Poletown; finding that \"public good\" is unconstitutional under the Michigan Constitution.\n \n The most recent decision (Kelo) is surprising because of the arguments put forth by the majority judges (Kennedy, Ginsburg, Souter, Stevens, and Breyer). They argued that the states should have the ability to determine what constitutes a public use under the fifth amendment; citing the right for states to be independent from Federal scrutiny. If you know anything about Kennedy, Breyer, or Ginsburg, who have done everything in their power to reduce the rights of states, you might see the irony in this.\n \n The dissenting judges (O'Connor specifically) issued a scathing retort to the majority. This included Scalia, O'Connor, Rehnquest, and Thomas - the most conservative group on the bench. They called the majority on their laughable attempt to ignore the Constitution (specifically the fact that part of the Fifth Amendment has been incorporated into Section 2 of the Fourteenth) and correctly identified the threat to our society that this decision presented.\n \n Unfortunately, two key judges, Stevens and Souter, wenet along with the socialist views of the liberal judges on the court, for reasons I cannot fathom. Likely they were swayed by the court's prior decision on this, and didn't want to take part in changing the law (at least that is probably the excuse for Stevens).\n \n Fortunately, the US Congress is currently considering a bill to prevent just this sort of activity from occuring. I believe the bill would define what falls within the realm of \"public use\" in this country, and resale to private owners wouldn't fit.\n \n Not bad for a first post emoticon_cool",
