Ingersoll (1833-1899), \"A Christmas Sermon,\" Evening Telegram, Dec. 19, 1891\n\n \n Ingersoll's compact message set off a firestorm of indignation, unbounded hatred, and threats of boycotting the Evening Telegram, all from the clergy of the day, those messengers of tidings of great joy.\n \n It lasted weeks. The Telegram demonstrated a lot of moxy in allowing Colonel Ingersoll to answer the criticism. It was pure Ingersoll in his glorious best, logic mixed with the tenderest of human emotions. The venemous words of the preachers did not survive, but Ingersoll's rebuttals live on. One can get a sense in his responses of the vitriol he faced for writing this simple piece about Christmas.\n \n Thanks for posting this classic. You can read at your leisure the timelessness truths he left us, and the apparent angst it caused the Christian community at the link below.\n \n http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/robert_ingersoll/christmas_sermon.html",
