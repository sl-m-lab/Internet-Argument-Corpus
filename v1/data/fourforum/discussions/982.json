Especially when you don't buckle them up! Your decision to drive around in a car full of un-restrained kids might be 'your decision' but it is affecting other people's lives. You could argue that a parent should have responsibility for the safety of their children, but that still won't save them when you have an accident, and despite how good you drive, it's the accident caused by the other driver that's going to hurt.\n \n Or, maybe you think driving children is an 'unusual' case?\n \n This is something you've missed. Other people may cause you to have an accident. People are going about thinking \"I'm driving safely, I'm obeying the rules, I'm not going to have an accident\" but that's what accidents are! Accidents.\n \n General insurance premiums on cars, accidents, etc go up because of increased risk. You might be single, and not have to worry about kids, but choosing to run a risk for yourself is indirectly affecting all your fellow citizens.\n \n Secondly if you accept that order on the road is needed for safety, then why are you against this particular and effective road rule?\n \n Why is it that this one safety rule is so offensive?\n \n The whole reason we have all these laws re: road usage is, hopefully to reduce accidents, injuries and deaths, even if the government has to force you kicking and screaming into saving yourself!\n \n There are some people who believe that they can drive adequately with no glasses, or with a few beers in them. Should we allow them to risk killing themselves too?\n \n I must therefore repeat...\n \nWe need to sometimes accept laws that are made for the dumbest in our society and if people are too dumb to realise that seat-belts save lives then it's good that society looks after them.\n \n Seat belts save lives\n\n \n \n And by the way since we're criticising each other's arguments for lack of clarity...\n \nTrue or False, a person not wearing a person is only risking their own life and not increasing the risk to any other person except in very, very unusual cases?\n\n \n What's a person wearing another person got to do with anything? That would be a very unusual case, unless you're Ted Bundy.\n \n \nTrue or False, a person not following any speed limits is only risking their own life and not increasing the risk to any other person except in very, very unusual cases?\n\n \n There are too many negatives in this sentence for me to understand what it is you're saying.\n \n \nTrue or False, not enforcing seat belt laws will make it next to impossible to safely drive anywhere because not everyone will be wearing a seat belt?\n\n \n Again, there are too many negatives in this sentence for me to understand what it is you're saying.\n \n \nTrue or False, not enforcing turn signals, traffic signals, car regulations, speed limits, and which side of the road you drive on will make it next to impossible to safely drive anywhere because everyone will be driving using different standards?\n\n \n This is a mixed bag. You're repeating speed limits again.Car makers are legislated to manufacture safer cars. This must really XXXX you off, because they're forcing you to drive a car that's safer, despite the fact you're a good driver and don't need all those standard features - you could be getting a cheaper car without them!\n \n Why not have a car that gives you a value for risk deal? Ford could produce a lower-budget, less safe car for you to drive. Let's not have legislators forcing the cost of buying a car up!\n \n Also, why are car makers including belts in their cars?

I thought it was pretty obvious that \"person not wearing a person\" was supposed to be \"person not wearing a seat belt\" so I threw that in just to see if you would attack me for miswording it or simply fix the wording yourself. Had you fixed it yourself you would have shown that you are at least interested in debating instead of attacking.\n \n BTW, I've got a little test in this post as well. It's pretty similar to the last one in purpose but harder to catch. Lets see if you find it :)\n \n \nThis is a mixed bag.

They are doing a service to us by making cars that are safer. I think you had this backwards anyways since I am pro-seat belts and want to be 'forced' to drive a car that is safer. You are the one that should be XXXXXX off.\n \n [QUOTE]Why not have a car that gives you a value for risk deal? Ford could produce a lower-budget, less safe car for you to drive.

You must be fuming that you're paying for something you don't use.\n\n \n Because they know well and good that even if included seat belt use is still optional. There is no downside to them being there. Also since I use the seatbelts provided for my own safety I don't need to be fuming.",

Again, no. \n \n There is no question that driving-- a commercial activity, is a priviledge. So, the cases you cited regarding Driving involve laws that regulate a particular commercial activity. \n \n Travelling (non-commercial activity) on the other hand, is a right acknowledged (& protected) by the state constitution. So, when you TRAVEL, do the laws which regulate DRIVING apply to you? NO! \n Will the cops cite you for driving offenses when you travel? YES. \n Does the traffic court have subject matter jurisdiction? NO.\n Can the traffic court prove jurisdiction? NO.\n Are any of their decisions voidable? If you were travelling, YES.\n Do many people know about this? No, it would put a bunch of lawyers out of easy work and a government's great money maker would be destroyed.\n \n Does all of this mean that the state of Florida has INVALID laws on the books which it enforces? Heck, YES!! (FL statute 196.011 where the state requires the disclosure of a SSN before granting a homestead exemption. Every enforcement of this statute is a federal felony and a federal civil rights violation.)\n \n How would your seatbelt laws apply to a traveler in Florida?\n\n \n The cases I cite do apply. They are supreme court decisions regarding driving. A person who sells roses and then violates firearms laws while selling roses has now violated a firearms law. It doesn't matter what he was doing. That is what these cases point out. The case has to do with the fact that a person's driver's license can be removed because of a drug infraction regardless of whether or not the person was driving at the time. \n \n You have a right to travel. You do not have a right to travel by driving a vehicle. You can take a bus or a plan etc. You do not have the right to drive a car just to travel. There is no such right. \n \n Now, I have given you my logic and case cites. You have given me your logic and reasoning about my information and you claim the supreme court of your state has said that traffic laws don't apply while you are travelling. Please provide your source. If you do not provide the source then I will consider the debate to have ended and claim victory as you cannot support your claim.",

   "Let me start off with a premise. Not every bad idea should be prohibited and not every good idea should be mandated. Smoking is a case in point in the first case. Although an extreemly bad idea, we might well be worse off if it were absolutely prohibited. Using seat belts is probably a good idea, at least it's not a bad one. But are we really better off being told to do so? \n \n A selection of highway fatality data from the Federal Highway Safely Commission for 2002 for six selected states show little or no correlation between seat-belt use and either accident rate or fatality rate. Admittedly a broader selection might result in a different conclusion. I selected Arizona, New Mexico (where I live, now you know), and Wyoming -(open space western States), Washington with the most punitive fines and highest rate of complience, Massachusetts with the lowest rate of complience, and New Hampshire with no adult requirement. While the fatality rate per 100K population in Washinton, with a complience rate of 93% was definitely lower than Az, NM, and Wy where complience ranged from 67 to 88 percent, Massachusetts with a complience of only 51% and NH had even lower fatality rates. Among the first three western states Wyoming did have the lowest complience rate (67%) and the highest fatality rate (35.3/100K). On the other hand, NM with a complience rate of 88% had a slightly higher fatality rate (24.2/100K) than did Arizona with a complience of 74% and a fatality rate of 20.5/100K). All this, though limited data, at least suggestes that there are other, more relevant factors in highway accidents and fatalities than seat belts. \n \n By the way, according to these data, one has about a 1 in 3000 to 1 in 5000 chance of being in a fatal accident, based on population. Is this high enough to use precaution including good driving as well as being buckled in. Probably so. Is it sufficient for government intrusion in this regard. I doubt it.",

Ironically, in most states suicide is a crime, but if successful there is no one to punish. However, attempted suicide can be a punishable crime (seldom charged against one surviving the attempt). \"Assisted suicide\" is usually treated as a crime, either specifically (as in Michigan) or as a form of homicide (second degree murder or manslaughter), even when done as a kindness to a loved one who is terminally ill and in great pain.\n http://dictionary.law.com/definition2.asp?selected=2057&bold=%7C%7C%7C%7C\n \n In terms of seat belts, it does cost money to use emergency vehicals and transportation and takes away from someone who may need an emergency vehical who needs it not because they chose to be stupid.

   "I am far from a Fascist. Fascists = corporatists. I am neither conservative, a Republican, nor a pro-ueber business corporatist.\n\n \n Corporatism and Fascism are mutually exclusive. Corporatism was a political ideaology advanced in the late 19th century as a possible solution to the class struggle of the time. It basically involved turning the running of the government over to corporate interests (primarily trade unions).\n \n What you are talking about (since you don't seem to know) is what is more correctly termed neo-corporatism, which is basically little more that corporate cronyism. \n \n Corporate cornyism is not a requirement for a fascist governemtn, it is a means, not the end. Mussolini used neo corporatism as a tool to control the civilian corporations. He knew it was easier to control somebody who you were in bed with, who thought you were looking out for their best interests, than it would have been to control those same entities by an iron fist while they fought you at every turn. \n \n As far as conservative, assuming you are talking traditional american conservatives values, small government, strong individual rights, free trade, fiscal responsibility, accountabiltiy of governemnt, etc... Conservatism and Fascism are mutually exclusive. They are 180 degree opposites. If, on the other hand, you are talking abotu the new \"conservatives...well, those guys are nothing but militant liberals, and American liberal ideals (keeping in mind that \"liberal\" ideals in America are the exact opposite of what \"liberal\" ideals are elsewhere int he world) are right along the correct lines as far as the fascist mindset goes. \n \n \nFascist government is characterized by mass-propaganda, control of the media, military leanings, gross violations of rights, and usually dictatoral control of one man. Fascist government's are intimately tied to corporate interests. \n \n \n These are indicators of a fascist government, but they are all just means to the desired end. Mussolini pretty much summed up the fascist mindset. He said \"The governemtn shall be to every citizen as a parent\". The corporate cronyism used during mussoilis reign had two purposes. One was to contorl corporate interests, the other was to put corporate interests at odds with labor and the population in general. While practicing corporate cronyism (neo-capitolism) the fascist also claimed to be working for the \"little man\" and protecting them from corporate interests. They pushed for stern control of corporations (which was easily bypassed by those corporations due tot he neo-corporatism being practiced) and preached equality amiong the classes. VERY liberal ideas by contemporary American standards.\n \n BTW, you don't need a dictator, an oligarchic plutocracy works just fine (which should scare the pants off af any American). The important thing is not so much to have a single man in power in a dictitorial capacity, but merely to ensure that everybody is marching in step to the beat of more or less the same drummer. Mussolini wrote abotu this fairly extensively, since he was not megalomaniacal enough to believe that he would live forever. His plan was actually to spin off 2 political parties, each with an election comittee which would ensure that only those who showed reverence to the proper ideals had a realistic expectation of election (today we call these the \"democratic national comitee\" and the \"republican national comittee\" He planned to call them the \"Labor commitee\" and the \"Corporate commitee\", as he planned to use the parties to further divide corporate interests and labor). He reaosned that as long as there were only 2 parties to choose from, and the proper sort was running things (those committed to ensuring the survival of the oligarchic plutocracy), things would tick over like clockwork.\n \n \n \nI am only meeting a very weak version of one of the above, so I can hardly be a Fascist...\n\n \n the one above is the sole key indicator of a fascist. Mussolini said it best, practically summed up the whole political movement in one sentence. \"Everything in the State, nothing outside the State, nothing against the State\". Therefore, he reasoned, there was no such thing as \"personal business\" or \"personal rights\" since all individual business is the states business, and the welfare of the state is the sole responsibility of the individual.\n \n \nDid you even try to attack my argument, or did you just resort to calling me a Fascist and be done with it? I must be the most liberal Fascist in the world then.\n\n \n Again, american liberalism, protecting people from themselves, assuming that we need a nanny state (or, as mussolini said, a state that we would see as a parent). American neo-corporatism became prolific as a result of the New deal. I can't think of a more liberal program in the history of our nation, and it continues today. Who do you tink isd really proppong up corporatism and using it as mussolini did, to keep corporat interests at odds with labor and trade unions? Could it be the liberals, who argue for tight corporate controls and claim to be sticking up for the blue collar worker, while at the same time pushing for open immigration policies, policies which ensure a steady flow of cheap labor for the corporate interests they are \"controlling\", labor which drives the blue collar worker (the little guys they claim to be looking our for) out of a job and crushes unions far more efficiently than any enforcer with a pick handle ever could?\n \n \nYes. I know of Mussolini--I am a History Major. He also said Fascism = Corporatism. People like to throw around the term Fascism all the time, even when the object of attack has little to do with Fascism.\n\n \n No he didn't. He said they (a fascit government and corporate interests) must be closely connected. Not the same. If you are a history major, wander down to the local watering hole and find a poli sci major and have them explain fascism to you. Better yet, in the poli sci department of most universities (the better ones anyway) they generally have courses on public and media manipulation. Most of them rely on mussolini heavily. He was quite possibly one of the greatest political minds of this century, and his mastery of the public was something to be beheld. I daresay that, had he been the ruler of germany instead of hitler, it is likely that we would all be speaking german now. He was that good when it came to public manipulation. He made hitler look like a rank newbie.\n \n \nI am not saying that people need government to control all aspects of their lives. I am saying people are too stupid to realize the damage caused by their actions--as is completely valid when people say not wearing your seatbelt harms no one but yourself. The facts speak to the opposite, but all people do is cry rights violations.\n\n \n Thats becuase we live under a system of governemnt that is theoretically based on personal liberites above all else. The primary, and ONLY function of our governemtn is supposed to be to ensure that our rights are not violated. You use an example fo somebody in the back seat flying forward and hitting somebody in the front seat. Since the driver is in control of the vehicle, it would be the drivers responsibilty to make people in the back seat wear their seat belts if that is what they wish to require. If that is not the rule of the driver, and people are uncomforatble with it, they can simply get out. \n \n \nAnd, as sad as it may be, Rights Ethics is one of the weakests--far more weak than Kantian Deontology or Utilitarianism.\n \n \n I am a Technocratic Utilitarian.\n\n \n So, you claim to not be a fascist, then you toss out \"I am a Technocratic Utilitarian\". Is this really because you fail to distiguish the difference between the two at the most fundamental level, or is it because you know the two are so close that it would take several hours to explain the differences? Mussolinis political ideals were, by his own admission, crafted almost entirely on the writings of Jeremy Bentham, who was the first to concieve of utilitarianism as a political system. \n \n Granted, in technocratic utilitarian systems the government entity is generally refered to as \"Big Brother\" as opposed to mussolinis \"parent\", but the concept is the same.\n \n If you are interested in technocratic utilitarian systems, I would suggest you read \"1984\" by George Orwell. The system described within is a technocratic utilitarian system. Often people mistake it for a totalitarian fascist system, but even by Orwells account, it is entirely based on technocratic utilitarian principals.\n \n \n \nI mean. you didn't even address most of the points I made... what parts do you disagree\n\n \n Thats because I don't see the individual points worth of address.

   " Corporatism and Fascism are mutually exclusive. Corporatism was a political ideaology advanced in the late 19th century as a possible solution to the class struggle of the time. It basically involved turning the running of the government over to corporate interests (primarily trade unions).\n\n \n According to the founder of 20th century Fascism, they are one and the same. You are so big on Mussolini, you should know that. Just because it was advanced earlier, does not mean that it's not Fascism.\n \n \n What you are talking about (since you don't seem to know) is what is more correctly termed neo-corporatism, which is basically little more that corporate cronyism.\n\n \n Actually, you are quite wrong. I know full-well what I am talking about. YOu compared to me Mussolini. I described what  he  called Fascism. Fascism = corporatism.\n \n don't believe me? \n \n 1. http://www.pigdog.org/auto/TheCorporate****/link/2441.html\n \n \n In the 1930's sometime, Mussolini said \"Corporatism is Fascism.\"\n\n \n Neo-corporatism--what you mentioned is what many authors dubb \"fascism-lite\" but it's not actually related to Fascism at all. It's a throw-around term.\n \n \n 2. http://www.zmag.org/gerbnerhitler.htm\n \n \n ... Let us not mince words, Corporatism is fascism with a human face.'.\n\n \n I am right. I have sources--direct sources. YOu have...zero. Prove my direct quotes from the Fascist Leader himself wrong. You can't. If you don't believe it, then I suggest someone retract the \"I am a Mussolini Fascist\" now.\n \n 3. http://raenergy.igc.org/bnt.html\n \n \n . It was Benito Mussolini who said: \"Fascism should more appropriately be called Corporatism. \"Corporatism is Fascism with a Human face. \n\n \n You confuse any capitalism with corporatism. Fascism and corporatism are one and the same directly from the mouth of the founder of modern Fascism. You neither know what neo-corporatism/ corporatism, or fascism are.\n \n In Fact, You are lying so badly that I will prove you wrong--yet again!\n \n 4 http://www.eurofound.eu.int/emire/ITALY/NEOCORPORATISM-IT.html\n \n \n Neo-corporatist models differ from those of corporatism , both of the nineteenth-century pre-industrial type and of the Fascist authoritarian type,\n\n \n *cough cough* your concession is now accepted. Neo-corporatism is not the same as either types of corporatism of the 19th century as well as the Fascist brand of the 20's- 40's. It makes distinct differentiations betwixt the 19th century pre-industrial corporatism, Fascist Corporatism, and Neo-Corporatism, which isn't Fascism. This is the opposite of what you say and exactly what I am saying.\n \n 5. http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a193350.htm\n \n \n Italians called it the estato corporativo: the corporative state  \n\n \n 6. http://corporatism.tripod.com/corporatism.htm\n \n \n  \"Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power.\" -- Benito Mussolini (from Encyclopedia Italiana, Giovanni Gentile, editor). \n\n \n 7. http://www.fascismo.com/ISMOS/fascismo/index.html\n \n Fascism was first coined by Mussolini in 1919, and it actualy went AGAINT prevelant 19th and 18th century ideals.\n \n I hope everyone here can now see how big a liar this \"conservative\" is. Rule one. Don't try to lie in debates. Rhetoric is nice, facts are better.\n \n Now please. Do a little google-search before you try to say someone doesn't know what he's talking about.  You  don't know what you're talking about. \n \n \n \n Thats because I don't see the individual points worth of address. The entire argument is flawed at its very roots.\n\n \n Your argument is idiotic at it's core. You can't even get your inane criticism's right. I Hope you learned from this mistake. Don't do it again. You lie and expect me to take you seriously.\n \n \n \n As far as conservative, assuming you are talking traditional american conservatives values, small government, strong individual rights, free trade, fiscal responsibility, accountabiltiy of governemnt, etc... Conservatism and Fascism are mutually exclusive. They are 180 degree opposites. If, on the other hand, you are talking abotu the new \"conservatives...well, those guys are nothing but militant liberals, and American liberal ideals (keeping in mind that \"liberal\" ideals in America are the exact opposite of what \"liberal\" ideals are elsewhere int he world) are right along the correct lines as far as the fascist mindset goes.\n\n \n 1. Uses the term Liberal like it's some insult, which it's not. Conservative on the other hand...no. That's not even an insult. THere's nothing wrong with either of them inherently. ONly someone without class or intelligence argues based on general source-buzz words.\n \n 2. You don't know what Fascism is, as I have already pointed out. Fascism is a right wing government type--usually quite conservative. It's the opposite of leftwing authoritarianism. \n \n 3. Conservative Family values aren't that great anyway, since many of them taut the toilet-paper worth bible as the source.\n \n \n \n So, you claim to not be a fascist, then you toss out \"I am a Technocratic Utilitarian\". Is this really because you fail to distiguish the difference between the two at the most fundamental level, or is it because you know the two are so close that it would take several hours to explain the differences?\n\n \n A. They aren't that close. Maybe if you pervert them, they might be, however. Technocratic Utilitarianism doesn't = totalitarian, Fascist, or Communist. And No. I don't fail to distinguish the differences. THey are quite plentiful and simple. With your understanding of what Corporatism and Fascism are in the first place, I think you need to reexamine them first before you comment on TU.\n \n Mussolinis political ideals were, by his own admission, crafted almost entirely on the writings of Jeremy Bentham, who was the first to concieve of utilitarianism as a political system.\n \n Granted, in technocratic utilitarian systems the government entity is generally refered to as \"Big Brother\" as opposed to mussolinis \"parent\", but the concept is the same.\n \n If you are interested in technocratic utilitarian systems, I would suggest you read \"1984\" by George Orwell. The system described within is a technocratic utilitarian system. Often people mistake it for a totalitarian fascist system, but even by Orwells account, it is entirely based on technocratic utilitarian principals.[/quote]\n \n 1. Do you even know what Utilitarian means?\n 2. Do you know what the technocratic ideal is? If so, explain. I wish to compare our definitions, since You love to twist political terminology around to suit your needs regardless of facts (shown above).\n \n A. A technocracy isn't even a political system, as stated by the Technocratic Manifesto. It's merely a system devised to help the economy and society by aiding in the development of a greater good for Humans. It's a system to improve the quality of life for individual people, their happiness. It's a system of duel civil/technocratic elements in government. It's not itself a political ideology.\n \n B. Utilitarianism is one of history's best ethical systems. Every read JS Mill? Peter Singer? Jeremy Bentham? All Utilitarians, as am I. They are hardly the evil 1984 Fascists you make them out to be.\n \n C. Technocratic Utilitarianism has very little to do with \"big brother\" or evil government. It's not even a political ideology. It's a combination of Ethics and Practical science. It's also tied to Positive Atheism and Secular Humanism. Oohhh big bad utilitarians commin' to get ya!\n \n \n \n Thats becuase we live under a system of governemnt that is theoretically based on personal liberites above all else. The primary, and ONLY function of our governemtn is supposed to be to ensure that our rights are not violated. You use an example fo somebody in the back seat flying forward and hitting somebody in the front seat.

If that is not the rule of the driver, and people are uncomforatble with it, they can simply get out.\n \n\n \n 1. The libertarian wanking begins. Our system of government is good, but people twist it to make it flawed. The primary and only function of our government is not to ONLY protect our rights. Government has many functions. Objectivists and Libertarians are those who spout this nonsense. The role of government is to protect the public, protect rights (unless in emergency or if greater utility can be served).\n \n 2 In light of the argument that the driver makes up rules of seatbelt conduct, this doesn't happen. Most don't care. Notwithstanding such irrelevant rules, It still poses a danger to occupants and the drivers in front. If a danger is posed to the drivers in front, they can very easily lose control of their car (even if it's not a rule according to the driver) and hurt others and spin out of control, damaging public property. NOt to mention, they are wasting hospital resouces on their on negligence and stupidity.\n \n \n \n \n No he didn't. He said they (a fascit government and corporate interests) must be closely connected. Not the same. If you are a history major, wander down to the local watering hole and find a poli sci major and have them explain fascism to you. Better yet, in the poli sci department of most universities (the better ones anyway) they generally have courses on public and media manipulation. Most of them rely on mussolini heavily. He was quite possibly one of the greatest political minds of this century, and his mastery of the public was something to be beheld. I daresay that, had he been the ruler of germany instead of hitler, it is likely that we would all be speaking german now. He was that good when it came to public manipulation. He made hitler look like a rank newbie.\n\n \n 1. History disagree's with you, as do many sources. Poli sci lol. NO thanks. I will go with historical sources and others. You can youse your imaginary sources if you wish, however. I am not going to do your homework for you. Your whole long-winded rhetoric on poli sci and universities is irrelevant when compared to what he exactly said and what economics describes Corporataism and neo-corporatism as. THe burden of proof is on you, not me.\n \n \n Again, american liberalism, protecting people from themselves, assuming that we need a nanny state (or, as mussolini said, a state that we would see as a parent).\n\n \n In many cases, they do, since people (like you) have no concept of safety, reality, or compassion for others. You wantonly risk hurting others with inane actions.\n \n \n\n American neo-corporatism became prolific as a result of the New deal. I can't think of a more liberal program in the history of our nation, and it continues today. Who do you tink isd really proppong up corporatism and using it as mussolini did, to keep corporat interests at odds with labor and trade unions?

You need government intervention on behalf of workers, or they will get stomped.\n \n \n BTW, you don't need a dictator, an oligarchic plutocracy works just fine (which should scare the pants off af any American). \n\n \n Yes. You don't have to, but you usually have dictators, which is the common element.\n \n The important thing is not so much to have a single man in power in a dictitorial capacity, but merely to ensure that everybody is marching in step to the beat of more or less the same drummer. Mussolini wrote abotu this fairly extensively, since he was not megalomaniacal enough to believe that he would live forever. His plan was actually to spin off 2 political parties, each with an election comittee which would ensure that only those who showed reverence to the proper ideals had a realistic expectation of election (today we call these the \"democratic national comitee\" and the \"republican national comittee\" He planned to call them the \"Labor commitee\" and the \"Corporate commitee\", as he planned to use the parties to further divide corporate interests and labor). He reaosned that as long as there were only 2 parties to choose from, and the proper sort was running things (those committed to ensuring the survival of the oligarchic plutocracy), things would tick over like clockwork.[/quote]\n \n Provide sources for all of this paragraph which clearly show it.\n \n \n STANDARD DEF. of Fascism\n \n 1. often Fascism\n 1. A system of government marked by centralization of authority under a dictator, stringent socioeconomic controls, suppression of the opposition through terror and censorship, and typically a policy of belligerent nationalism and racism.\n 2. A political philosophy or movement based on or advocating such a system of government.\n 2. Oppressive, dictatorial control.",

   "According to the founder of 20th century Fascism, they are one and the same. You are so big on Mussolini, you should know that. Just because it was advanced earlier, does not mean that it's not Fascism.\n\n \n Since fascism is the word ONLY for the fascist regime, administered under Mussolini in Italy, it would seem that he, as the leader of the ONLY true fascist regime in the history of the planet, would be a pretty good source. \n \n \n \n \nActually, you are quite wrong. I know full-well what I am talking about. YOu compared to me Mussolini. I described what  he  called Fascism. Fascism = corporatism.\n \n don't believe me? \n \n 1. http://www.pigdog.org/auto/TheCorporate****/link/2441.html\n\n \n This says something about squirells, nothing about fascism or corporatism\n \n \n \n \nNeo-corporatism--what you mentioned is what many authors dubb \"fascism-lite\" but it's not actually related to Fascism at all. It's a throw-around term.\n \n \n 2. http://www.zmag.org/gerbnerhitler.htm\n \n \n \n This is an article by Pablo Neruda about nazism, which is not the same as fascism (though the two are certianly kissing cousins).\n \n \nI am right. I have sources--direct sources. YOu have...zero. Prove my direct quotes from the Fascist Leader himself wrong. You can't. If you don't believe it, then I suggest someone retract the \"I am a Mussolini Fascist\" now.\n \n 3. http://raenergy.igc.org/bnt.html\n\n \n NOW, take a hard look at what he is calling corporatism in this article. It is the merger of corporate power and state power. It is a lot closer to socialism than what you are inferring here. \n \n What Mussolini said was \"Fascism should more appropriately be called corporativism.\" Which is entirely different. I don't blame you for the misunderstanding in the face of a bad translation (I have only ever seen it translated correctly in advanced poli sci textbooks). The problem is that very same idiotic mis-translation has been repeated so many hundreds of times it is not even funny. Just becuase it kind of sounds the same, doesn't make it so.\n \n Corporatism involves trade untions and corporations directly running a country\n \n Neo corporatism involves basically high level corporate cronyism.\n \n Here is the definition of corporativism:\n \n Italian corporativismo , also called corporativism the theory and practice of organizing society into \"corporations\" subordinate to the state.\n \n It is the exact opposite of what you are claiming here, where the state is subordinate to the corporations.\n \n As such, we can pretty much discount just about every link you have provided, since thoe authors apparently did not grasp the differnce between \"corporatism\" and \"corporativism\"\n \n \n I would sugegst you read some of mussolinis books. He NEVER, EVER used the term \"corporatism\". He used the term \"corporate state\" in order to convey the idea that state power and corporate power were united, but ALWAYS witht he corporate sector in strict subservience to the state.\n You ca aregue abotu this all you like. We know what corporatism is, it is laid out very clearly in Rerum Novarum. I have a couple copies of it on my shelf, one in english and one in greek. I would loan you the english copy if you would like (the greek one is an original and rather delicate).\n \n I am going to edit out the next bit of jibber jabber. In order to prove that fascism is corporatism, you have to show corporate interests were directly running things. In order to prove that it is even neo-corporatism, you have to show that cronyism was taking place and influencing the government and how things were run. You can't, because it simply didn't happen.\n \n There is a brief article at http://www.thecorner.org/hists/total/f-italy.htm Scroll down to \"The Creation of a Corporate State\" Here is what it says:\n \n \nThe basic aim of all economic measures was to bring economic prosperity to Italy. Since 1921 Mussolini continued to adopt the high tariff policy to protect the home market from the competition of foreign goods. The most important economic reform was, however, the formation of the Corporate State. \n \n On April 21, 1927 the Labour Charter solemnly expressed the ideas of Fascist Corporate State. According to the Charter, the government would bring both employers and employees of the same trade into one confederation. \n \n In 1934 twenty-two corporations were formed. Each corporation consisted of employers' and workers' representatives. The government also sent its representatives to participate in the administration of the corporations. All the corporations were put under the supervision of a National Council of Corporations, of which Mussolini was the Chairman. \n \n These Corporations provided accident, unemployment and health insurance for workers. But the workers' strikes were forbidden. Workers could appeal to the Labour Courts of the Corporations if they had any disputes with the employers. The employers were urged by the government representatives of each corporation to improve the conditions of the workers-there should be no lockouts of workers by employers.\n\n \n This is the \"corporate state\" that people refer to in regards to fascism, not corporatism, or even Neo corporatism that we we refer to today. Every corporation in fascist italy was under the direct supervision of the National Council of Corporations. Mussolini, as ruler on high, was also Chairman. As chairman, he had absolute power to issue edicts as well as to veto any decision made by the council. \n \n There is an interesting article by Sheldon Richman at http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Fascism.html that gives a little more insight into this. \n \n \nTheoretically, the fascist economy was to be guided by a complex network of employer, worker, and jointly run organizations representing crafts and industries at the local, provincial, and national levels. At the summit of this network was the National Council of Corporations. But although syndicalism and corporativism had a place in fascist ideology and were critical to building a consensus in support of the regime, the council did little to steer the economy. The real decisions were made by state agencies such as the Institute for Industrial Reconstruction (Istituto per la Ricosstruzione Industriale, or IRI), mediating among interest groups. \n \n \n Again, his \"corporatism\" was the exact opposite of \"corporatism\", where corporate entities either directly control the government, I only give you neo corporatism because it is presumed that the National council of corporations did at least have Mussolinis ear (though one would be hard pressed to prove it, since the council never made a single major economic decision, and those who disagreed with the chairman disapeared and were replaced by somebody more pliant.\n \n Here is the paragraph from the Charter of Labor (1927) that essentially nationalised ALL business interests in Italy and made them directly and completely subordinate to the government:\n \n \nThe corporations constitute the unitary organization of production\n and represent completely its interests. In view of this complete\n representation, the interests of production being national\n interests, the corporations are recognized by law as organs of the\n State.\n\n \n The illusion of control by the corporations in Italy were kept up until a firm enough grip was achived to replace it with the Chamber of the Fasces and Corporations. This organisation was different in that there was no pretense of control. Whereas the National Council of Corporations had provisions for voting and elected representation from the individual corporations (which were not \"corporations\" as we think of them now, but more like midevil guilds), as impotent as those provisions may have been, since the chairman had full veto power and the ability to issue uncontestable vetos, The Chamber of Fasces and Corporations did not have any such provisions. Memebers were appointed, and were assinged the task of carrying out the dewcisions of the council, which were made only by the chairman (Mussolini). Members were appointed by the state, there was no voting invloved. \n \n \n \nI hope everyone here can now see how big a liar this \"conservative\" is. Rule one. Don't try to lie in debates. Rhetoric is nice, facts are better.\n \n Now please. Do a little google-search before you try to say someone doesn't know what he's talking about.  You  don't know what you're talking about. \n\n \n I tossed out the \"possibly neo corporatism\" as an olive branch, and opportunity for you to back of gracefully. Consider it declined.\n \n Sheesh, a history major who doesn't understand the difference between a fascist corporate state and corporatism by any definition. No wonder this country is going to pot.\n \n \n \n \n1. Uses the term Liberal like it's some insult, which it's not. Conservative on the other hand...no. That's not even an insult. THere's nothing wrong with either of them inherently. ONly someone without class or intelligence argues based on general source-buzz words.\n\n \n \n I used neither as an insult. I pointed out that traditional American conservatism is 180 degrees opposite of fascism. That is not an insult. Traditional conservative ideals and traditional fascist ideas are simply mutually exclusive. Just because you are uncomfortable with the fact that your political mindset is a lot closer to most totalitarianist states than mine does not mean I am using the word \"liberal\" as in insult.\n \n Nor am I arguing based on general source buzz words. That is why I specifically went out of my way to define things like traditional american conservative values and ensure that it was understood that in \"liberal\" ideals I was talking about American liberal ideals.\n \n \n2. You don't know what Fascism is, as I have already pointed out. Fascism is a right wing government type--usually quite conservative. It's the opposite of leftwing authoritarianism. \n \n \n No, it is not. First, you accuse me of using \"general source buzz words\", then you hit us with \"right wing\" and \"left wing\"? Are you high? You are classifying governemnt based on the seating arrangements of liberals and conservatives in the French National Assemble of 1789. To compound the hypocracy of your statement here, \"right wing\" and \"left wing\" refers to liberals and conservatives as understood by the french in 1789, which is more or less the exact opposite of how the terms are uysed in modern America.\n \n So, you may well be right, if we use the terms \"right wing\" and \"left wing\" as they were originally used, to describe french political parties. The liberals championed small government, individual liberties (thus the name), free trade, fiscal responsibility, accountabiltiy of governement\n \n These got flipped flopped in America because a new paradigm emerged in the political forum. People started cropping up with new political ideals. They believed that personal liberties should be superceded for the good of the populace as a whole. They believed that a strong, and large, governemtn was needed to provide for the social needs of the population. They believed that a \"tax and spend\" policy was the way to go, since the government could more responsibly make decisions regarding our finances than the individual. They believed that free trade should be \"mdified\" in the name of social justice and equality.\n \n This was the exact opposite fo tyraditional american values, so those who would have been called \"liberal\" by the eurpean definition of the word came to be known as \"conservatives\" since they championed the traditional values. We assigned the term \"liberal\" to the other side for two reasons. First, at the time we were well versed in european politics, and the liberals were, in european politics, the other side of the coin from conservatives. The other reason is that we use an entirely different definition from the European one. Our \"liberal\" has nothign to do with liberty, the definition we use is more along the line of \"favoring proposals for reform\".\n \n Since the conservatives have always been the \"rigth wing\" and the liberals have always been the \"left wing\", we adopted the labels (or, more accuratly,. had them thrust upon us).\n \n So, you are saying that the folks who argue for personal liberty, a limited governement, free trade, and accountibility from the governnment, are thinking along the same lines as a totalitarin regime like Fascism, which specifically denies everything I just listed? You must have been drinking all night to come up with that one.\n \n \n3. Conservative Family values aren't that great anyway, since many of them taut the toilet-paper worth bible as the source.\n\n \n Where did this come from? I don't recall talking about conservative family values at all.\n \n \n \n \nA. They aren't that close. Maybe if you pervert them, they might be, however. Technocratic Utilitarianism doesn't = totalitarian, Fascist, or Communist. And No. I don't fail to distinguish the differences. THey are quite plentiful and simple. With your understanding of what Corporatism and Fascism are in the first place, I think you need to reexamine them first before you comment on TU.\n\n \n \nMussolinis political ideals were, by his own admission, crafted almost entirely on the writings of Jeremy Bentham, who was the first to concieve of utilitarianism as a political system.\n\n \n I left this in because I am going to use it in a minute.\n \n \n1. Do you even know what Utilitarian means?\n\n \n Yes. It is a school of political thought first advanced by Jeremy Bentham in an essay called \"Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation\", which was written in 1780 (though most will incorrectly state 1789, which is actually the date it was published). He advanced the theory (the original essay was little more than a basic framework) that individual rights should be forfeit for the good of society, and that the government should strive to enforce happiness on those that they govern (admittedly my words, but fitting I believe). He further went on tho say that all decisions should be based on utility (thus the name) and should be entirely devoid of any sense of rights or duties, which he saw as purely legal notions which could be safely disposed of. \n \n Bentham was a child prodigy and carried a disfunction common to child prodigies, he was an absolute sociopath. He was described by his own parents as \"entirely devoid of emotion\". His entire political philosophy was based on logic unencumbered by any sense of morals or emotion and was based almost entirely on pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain. A classic example of utilitarianism is as follows:\n \n \nA surgeon has six patients: one needs a liver, one needs a pancreas, one needs a gall bladder, and two need kidneys. The sixth just came in to have his appendix removed. Should the surgeon kill the sixth man and pass his organs around to the others? \n \n \n Under classic utilitarianism, we kill the health man and distribute his organs.\n \n Utilitarianism later broke into two distinct branches, act utilitarianism (the good is whatever brings the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people) and rule utilitarianism (the best act is the one that would be enjoined by whichever rule would yield the most utility).\n \n Nazism and Fascism were both largely based on utlitarianism. \n \n \n \n2. Do you know what the technocratic ideal is? If so, explain. I wish to compare our definitions, since You love to twist political terminology around to suit your needs regardless of facts (shown above).\n\n \n Yes, it is a bunch of idealistic nonsense. Originally the theory was developed buy a bunch of star trek junkies (literally) the basis of the project was \"how would we buy things if we had transporters and could beam things up, and replicators to just make things that we want shoot out of our walls\". From this plans for an entire hypothetical, science based, society emerged where automation makes life easier for all of us and our economy is based on \"energy accounting\", which means we pay fo things based on the amount of energy that was required to produce it. The idea of \"energy accounting\" was originally advanced because if you had a transporter and a replicator, like captain picard, physical forms of payment would be basically worthless, since you could simply set your replicator to make golkd, or transport yourself into fort knox, transport gold out of the earths crust. \n \n Sad, but true. This is the origin of your philosophy. Nerds with too much time on their hand theorising about what our worlkd would be like if we were all members of star fleet.\n \n \nA. A technocracy isn't even a political system, as stated by the Technocratic Manifesto. It's merely a system devised to help the economy and society by aiding in the development of a greater good for Humans. It's a system to improve the quality of life for individual people, their happiness. It's a system of duel civil/technocratic elements in government. It's not itself a political ideology.\n\n \n Yes, it is based on the theory that using current technology we can automate the vast majority of labor functions, while never taking into account the law of industrial automation, which states that for every job lost to automation, 3 support jobs are created. But, why should they take that into consideration, on Star Trek, 2 or 3 guys from the engineering department take care of a whole ship. \n \n \nB. Utilitarianism is one of history's best ethical systems. Every read JS Mill? Peter Singer? Jeremy Bentham? All Utilitarians, as am I. They are hardly the evil 1984 Fascists you make them out to be.\n\n \n You need to take a HARD look at the writings of Bentham, keeping in mind that the man was a sociopath and had absolutly no concept of \"right\" and \"wrong\", which he called \"little more than games that are played in polite society and have no place in governance\". This guy was the founder of your movement. \n \n \nC. Technocratic Utilitarianism has very little to do with \"big brother\" or evil government. It's not even a political ideology. It's a combination of Ethics and Practical science. It's also tied to Positive Atheism and Secular Humanism. Oohhh big bad utilitarians commin' to get ya!\n\n \n Again, take a hard look at 1984. We have never had a strictly utilitarian society, but soviet russia was likely as close as we have ever gotten. Decisions based soley on utility with little or no regard for individual rights, and all done in the name of the common good. \n \n \n \n1. The libertarian wanking begins. Our system of government is good, but people twist it to make it flawed. The primary and only function of our government is not to ONLY protect our rights. Government has many functions. Objectivists and Libertarians are those who spout this nonsense. The role of government is to protect the public, protect rights (unless in emergency or if greater utility can be served).\n\n \n No, the sole purpose of our governement was to protect our right. Thomas Jefferson said this, as did Alexander Hamilton, as did Samuel Adams. At least a dozen early supreme court justices stated this in decisions. \n \n The experiment has very nearly failed because we have tried to twist the foundation of our governemnt into something it is not, and something it is not compatible with. \n \n I am going to snip some more ut here, since it is mostly meaningless garbage where you refute nothing, instead resorting to a childish display of \"prove it meanie\"\n \n \nThe world would be a poor place without socialist policies and a mixed economy. You need government intervention on behalf of workers, or they will get stomped.\n\n \n I don't believe I was discussing mixing socialist policies in a mixed economy. Iw as talking abotu the rise of neo-corporatism and the new deal, and how neo-corporatism in the US is almost wholly a liberal creation. \n \n \n \n \nProvide sources for all of this paragraph which clearly show it.\n\n \n See Il Fascismo E Le Corporazioni and the Il Popolo d'Italia collection. There is also an excellent book called simply \"Mussolini\" that contains a pretty good mix of his writings.\n \n Just out of curiousity, did you think that guys like Hitler and Mussolini, didn't ever bother to plan for when they were gone? They just assumed that when their time came, their state would wither and die? \n \n You might also check out the",

Corporatism (sometimes called corporativism)\n \n E. Historically, corporatism or corporativism (Italian corporativismo) is a political system in which legislative power is given to corporations that represent economic, industrial, and professional groups. Unlike pluralism, in which many groups must compete for control of the state, in corporatism, certain unelected bodies take a critical role in the decision-making process.\n \n F. Mario Palmieri, The Philosophy of Fascism, Chicago, 1936.\n \n Fascism is the merger of state and corporate power. It's a corporate state, im his own words. YOu can call it whatever you like. I will go by the second half of his sentence. THat's what on I am focusing. Do you not agree it's the merger of Corporate and State power? I don't see how you can disagree with what he said. It just so happens that the state controls the corporations.\n \n \n \n \n NOW, take a hard look at what he is calling corporatism in this article. It is the merger of corporate power and state power. It is a lot closer to socialism than what you are inferring here.\n\n \n Yes. Look above. Fascism is corporatism, and corporatism is the merger of state and corporate power. It says the same **** in my poli-sci book. It links \n \n \n It's the merger of state and corporate power. That's my argument. Corporativism  was  a part of Fascist Ideology. Corporatism and Corporativism are one and the same when referring to Italy, hence the frequent \"or\" statement, not \"and.\"\n \n \n \n What Mussolini said was \"Fascism should more appropriately be called corporativism.\" Which is entirely different. I don't blame you for the misunderstanding in the face of a bad translation (I have only ever seen it translated correctly in advanced poli sci textbooks). The problem is that very same idiotic mis-translation has been repeated so many hundreds of times it is not even funny. Just becuase it kind of sounds the same, doesn't make it so.\n\n \n Look above at most of the souces: You also ignored the source above which stated there's a clear difference between Neo-Corporatism and Fascist Corporatism and classical Corporatism. \n \n Neo-Corporatism I am not even concerning, since it's totally irrelevant to what I am talking about. It's clearly not the same as what Mussolini was referring to, since it's stated as such.\n \n IMPORTANT NOTE** Italian corporatism IS corporativism\n \n historychannel.com\n \n A. political stance or system of government resembling Mussolini's, as further ... Historically,\n corporatism or corporativism (Italian corporativismo). They referr to it as the same entity, and it's different from the 19th century and modern corporatism.\n \n You're problem is with mainstream, not me.\n \n \"One could not think of a \"corporate state\" or a \"syndicalist state\" without thinking of the fascist party.\"-- http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v04/v04p--5_Whisker.html\n \n \n \n \n t is the exact opposite of what you are claiming here, where the state is subordinate to the corporations.\n \n As such, we can pretty much discount just about every link you have provided, since thoe authors apparently did not grasp the differnce between \"corporatism\" and \"corporativism\"\n\n \n Doesn't jive with many other sources as well as the Encyclopedia explanation of Corporativism. It clearly says they are the same thing. Now. I am not arguring with you that Mussolini was a Corporativist, and I am not saying that the corporations run the state. I said that a FASCIST government is on in which the STate and the corporation are one, they are merged and their interests are one. That is the definition of Fascism. Italian corporatism is Corporativism, as it is, in maintream, commonly used with an \"or.\" There are many types of Corporatism. Italian, modern, classic. etc, as I have shown. I am not saying corporativism doesn't/didn't exist. That is what they referr to as Corporatism (italian).\n \n \n \n back to wikipedia: [B]The term corporatism has different meanings in different contexts. [/B} Most notably, the historical usage of the term is not the same as its modern usage.  \n \n According to various theorists corporatism was an attempt to create a \"modern\" version of feudalism by merging the \"corporate\" interests with those of the state. Also see neofeudalism.\n \n This use of the term \"corporation\" is not exactly equivalent to the restricted modern sense of the word. Compare corporate state and militarism. Corporate in this context is intended to convey the meaning of a \"body,\" as in corpus. Its purpose is to reflect more medieval European concepts of a whole society in which the various parts each play a part in the life of the society, just as the various parts of the body play specific parts in the life of a body.\n \n I am talking about this type of corporatism. Not modern corporate control of government. It alk talking about merging corporate/government interests and the gov't actually controlling the corporations. That's why it's not neo-corporatism to which Mussolini is referring.\n \n The modern version is as such:  Today, corporatism or neo-corporatism is used in reference to tendencies in politics for legislators and administrations to be influenced or dominated by the interests of business enterprises (limited liability corporations). The influence by other types of corporations, such as those representing organized labor, is relatively minor. In this view, government decisions are seen as being influenced strongly by which sorts of policies will lead to greater profits for favored companies. In this sense of the word, corporatism is also termed corporatocracy. \n \n This is not what I'm talking about, since it's not what Mussolini said. He said Corporatism, but that can also mean corporativism. It's not a mistranslation, it's a different type, according to Historians.\n \n \n \n Quote:\n Provide sources for all of this paragraph which clearly show it.\n \n \n See Il Fascismo E Le Corporazioni and the Il Popolo d'Italia collection. There is also an excellent book called simply \"Mussolini\" that contains a pretty good mix of his writings.\n \n Just out of curiousity, did you think that guys like Hitler and Mussolini, didn't ever bother to plan for when they were gone? They just assumed that when their time came, their state would wither and die?\n \n You might also check out the\n\n \n Thank you. It seems like a good read. I found other stuff on it too, they are both good.\n \n \n I don't believe I was discussing mixing socialist policies in a mixed economy. Iw as talking abotu the rise of neo-corporatism and the new deal, and how neo-corporatism in the US is almost wholly a liberal creation.\n \n\n \n Ok. This is our misunderstanding. I am not arguing with you about any of that. I am arguing that I am not a fascist in the sense of Mussolini, since in mussolini's government, the State was absolute and merged with corporate interests. That's exactly what I said above: I don't believe I was discussing mixing socialist policies in a mixed economy. Iw as talking abotu the rise of neo-corporatism and the new deal, and how neo-corporatism in the US is almost wholly a liberal creation.\n \n I am focusing on how the government controls corporations and melds interests. Corporatism = corporativism according to mainstream. It's a different (not modern) form of Corporatism. I am not talking about Neo-Corporatism. You could very well be right about what modern society is.\n \n \n \n No, the sole purpose of our governement was to protect our right. Thomas Jefferson said this, as did Alexander Hamilton, as did Samuel Adams. At least a dozen early supreme court justices stated this in decisions.\n \n The experiment has very nearly failed because we have tried to twist the foundation of our governemnt into something it is not, and something it is not compatible with.\n \n I am going to snip some more ut here, since it is mostly meaningless garbage where you refute nothing, instead resorting to a childish display of \"prove it meanie\"\n\n \n THe burden of proof is on you. When called upon to provide proof and a source, you have to do it. It's not \"childish.\" You have no clue what burden of proof is, obviously. I don't have to refute it untill you show evidence. A government that only focuses on rights cannot work. According to Objectivism, this means that no one ever can be made to help anyone else. Rights based-total government philosophy ignores altruism. It's not an effective social system.\n \n \n Again, take a hard look at 1984. We have never had a strictly utilitarian society, but soviet russia was likely as close as we have ever gotten. Decisions based soley on utility with little or no regard for individual rights, and all done in the name of the common good.\n \n\n \n The Soviet Union was hardly Utilitarian, since hardly anyone was happy, and the policies were ment to enrich the soviet government, not the people. Communism is not Utilitarianism. \n \n In actuallity, many Utilitarians agree, as do I, that RIghts are an important Utilitarian ideal. THey make people happy, they make them feel safe, and they give them something to take away. They (in general) make a good society. There are problems, however, and other utilitarian concerns can override rights. It's not the only ethical philosophy, and it, by itself, is the weakest. I am not a Rights based-ethicist, but I do recognize rights as being of value becaue of  their Utility and nothing more. No one has intrinsic rights. It's nonsese on stilts. People have rights becaues of the utility they provide as a general Rule.\n \n You are making a caricature of Utilitarianism by comparing it to Communism. The two aren't even remotely similiar.\n \n Communism and it's marxist source are actually anti-mass happiness.\n \n Juddith Law--Analysing moral issues.\n \n \n You need to take a HARD look at the writings of Bentham, keeping in mind that the man was a sociopath and had absolutly no concept of \"right\" and \"wrong\", which he called \"little more than games that are played in polite society and have no place in governance\". This guy was the founder of your movement.\n\n \n  prove it\n \n Show evidence and sources that say he was a Socio-path. Untill then, your statement is useless sophistry. ANd he did have a sense of right/wrong. It's called Utilitarianism. Although, Utilitarianism has been added to greatly since the 18th century. He's an ethical philospher. YOu cannot assume what's right or wrong without begging the question.\n \n \n The purpose of Government, according to JS mill and Bentham is to provide for the greatest happiness, which is moral.\n \n Utilitarianism is a valid ethical theory and it's grown. It's endeavour is normative. Right and wrong are utility--whatever does the most good in terms of producing happiness/preference satisfaction is what you ought to do. RIghts can be of utility, so they have consideration.\n \n \n So, you are saying that the folks who argue for personal liberty, a limited governement, free trade, and accountibility from the governnment, are thinking along the same lines as a totalitarin regime like Fascism, which specifically denies everything I just listed? You must have been drinking all night to come up with that one.\n \n\n \n No. I am saying that not. ANd yes, I do know. The european/American versions of left/right aren't the same. What you're reffering to above is Libertarian. I have nothing against most libertarian social policies. They are hardly totalitarian.\n \n \n Yes, it is based on the theory that using current technology we can automate the vast majority of labor functions, while never taking into account the law of industrial automation, which states that for every job lost to automation, 3 support jobs are created. But, why should they take that into consideration, on Star Trek, 2 or 3 guys from the engineering department take care of a whole ship.\n\n \n They do way more than that.\n \n \n \n \n Yes, it is a bunch of idealistic nonsense.\n\n \n I don't agree with everything. YOu need to support it all to support some ideals.\n \n \n\n Originally the theory was developed buy a bunch of star trek junkies (literally) the basis of the project was \"how would we buy things if we had transporters and could beam things up, and replicators to just make things that we want shoot out of our walls\". From this plans for an entire hypothetical, science based, society\n\n \n False. Technocracy was developed in the 20's an 30's. Well-before startrek was even aired. So, stop lying to poison the well. YOu know nothing about Tecnocracy.\n \n It has nothing at all to do with startrek, since it largely developd prior. He was about 12 years old when the movement began lol. Star trekkies must have gone back in time to kidnap him and make it make ST earlier eh? Bullsheit.\n \n Trekkies didn't exist at this time i'm afraid, so your argument is ********, as usual.\n \n By 1930 the group had become known as Technocracy. In 1933 it was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York as a non-political, non-sectarian, non-profit membership organization.\n \n \n\n Emerged where automation makes life easier for all of us and our economy is based on \"energy accounting\", which means we pay fo things based on the amount of energy that was required to produce it. The idea of \"energy accounting\" was originally advanced because if you had a transporter and a replicator, like captain picard, physical forms of payment would be basically worthless, since you could simply set your replicator to make golkd, or transport yourself into fort knox, transport gold out of the earths crust.\n\n \n More star-trek nonsense that has no basis and ignores the fact that the movement was created by a scientific organisation well-prior to teh development of stupid, useless startrek.\n \n It derives nothing from any of the historic political theorists such as Adam Smith, David Ricardo or Karl Marx. The basic views of Technocracy derive (embryonically) from the works of Joseph Willard Gibbs, the father of physical chemistry.\n \n \n \n \n Under classic utilitarianism, we kill the health man and distribute his organs.\n \n Utilitarianism later broke into two distinct branches, act utilitarianism (the good is whatever brings the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people) and rule utilitarianism (the best act is the one that would be enjoined by whichever rule would yield the most utility).\n \n Nazism and Fascism were both largely based on utlitarianism. \n\n \n 1. Actually, the doctor/patient scenario is largely contrive and misunderstood. The Utilitarian (especially the Rule Utilitarian) would not condone murdering the individual healthy person to save the lives of say--6 individuals. You have to consider potenial long-run abuses, how many people are effected, cost, etc.\n \n If you were to kill the individual, it's largely damaging to the insitution of medcine and the hospital and can lead to even more deaths.\n \n 2. Act Utilitarianism is mixed with Rule Utilitarianism. Many think there are huge differences, but there really arn't. Rule Utilitarianism breaks down into Act Utilitarianism when the rule can be bent without doing much harm or providing a social precedent.\n \n \n A. They aren't that close. Maybe if you pervert them, they might be, however. Technocratic Utilitarianism doesn't = totalitarian, Fascist, or Communist. And No. I don't fail to distinguish the differences. THey are quite plentiful and simple. With your understanding of what Corporatism and Fascism are in the first place, I think you need to reexamine them first before you comment on TU.\n \n \n Quote:\n Mussolinis political ideals were, by his own admission, crafted almost entirely on the writings of Jeremy Bentham, who was the first to concieve of utilitarianism as a political system.\n \n \n I left this in because I am going to use it in a minute.\n\n \n Source.

It just so happens that the state controls the corporations.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nYes. Look above. Fascism is corporatism, and corporatism is the merger of state and corporate power. It says the same **** in my poli-sci book. It links \n \n \n It's the merger of state and corporate power. That's my argument. Corporativism  was  a part of Fascist Ideology. Corporatism and Corporativism are one and the same when referring to Italy, hence the frequent \"or\" statement, not \"and.\"\n\n \n You are missing the point. Fascism was not corporatism by any definition of the word because, while it was certainly a corporative state, the corporations lacked any power at all. All power belonged to the state. \n \n \n \n \nLook above at most of the souces: You also ignored the source above which stated there's a clear difference between Neo-Corporatism and Fascist Corporatism and classical Corporatism. \n \n \n Thats becuase what is being refered to as \"Fascist corporatism\" is not. It is corporativism, which is an entirely different monster. This seems to have been shown rather clearly by now (since every definition of corporatism involves at least some degree of power being held by the corporate interests, while in corporativism there is absolutly NO power held by the corporate interests).\n \n \nNeo-Corporatism I am not even concerning, since it's totally irrelevant to what I am talking about. It's clearly not the same as what Mussolini was referring to, since it's stated as such.\n \n IMPORTANT NOTE** Italian corporatism IS corporativism\n \n historychannel.com\n \n A. political stance or system of government resembling Mussolini's, as further ... Historically,\n corporatism or corporativism (Italian corporativismo). They referr to it as the same entity, and it's different from the 19th century and modern corporatism.\n \n You're problem is with mainstream, not me.\n\n \n Note a distinction is made here between corporatism and corporativismo, they are not referring to it as the same entity or they would not have bothered to make the distinction.\n \n \n \"One could not think of a \"corporate state\" or a \"syndicalist state\" without thinking of the fascist party.\"-- http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v04/v04p--5_Whisker.html\n\n \n Thats becuae it was a corporative state, but still lacked the power for the corpoarate interests inherent in corporatism.\n \n \n \nDoesn't jive with many other sources as well as the Encyclopedia explanation of Corporativism. It clearly says they are the same thing. Now. I am not arguring with you that Mussolini was a Corporativist, and I am not saying that the corporations run the state. I said that a FASCIST government is on in which the STate and the corporation are one, they are merged and their interests are one. That is the definition of Fascism. Italian corporatism is Corporativism, as it is, in maintream, commonly used with an \"or.\" There are many types of Corporatism. Italian, modern, classic. etc, as I have shown. I am not saying corporativism doesn't/didn't exist. That is what they referr to as Corporatism (italian).\n\n \n But that is not waht happened in Italy. They were not one. In being one, corporate interests would have had some power or authority. That would have been corporatism. What they practiced in itraly was a lot closer to socialism in the economi sense. All means of production were strictly subservient to the state. Corporate power ceased to exist and only the will of mussolini, as head of state, mattered. \n \n \n \nback to wikipedia: [B]The term corporatism has different meanings in different contexts. [/B} Most notably, the historical usage of the term is not the same as its modern usage.  \n \n According to various theorists corporatism was an attempt to create a \"modern\" version of feudalism by merging the \"corporate\" interests with those of the state. Also see neofeudalism.\n \n This use of the term \"corporation\" is not exactly equivalent to the restricted modern sense of the word. Compare corporate state and militarism. Corporate in this context is intended to convey the meaning of a \"body,\" as in corpus. Its purpose is to reflect more medieval European concepts of a whole society in which the various parts each play a part in the life of the society, just as the various parts of the body play specific parts in the life of a body.\n \n I am talking about this type of corporatism. Not modern corporate control of government. It alk talking about merging corporate/government interests and the gov't actually controlling the corporations. That's why it's not neo-corporatism to which Mussolini is referring.\n\n \n You are still missing the key point here. \n \n From wikpedia:\n \n \nHistorically, corporatism or corporativism (Italian corporativismo) is a political system in which legislative power is given to corporations that represent economic, industrial, and professional groups. Unlike pluralism, in which many groups must compete for control of the state, in corporatism, certain unelected bodies take a critical role in the decision-making process. This original meaning was not connected with the specific notion of a business corporation, being a rather more general reference to any incorporated body. The word \"corporatism\" is derived from the Latin word for body, corpus.\n\n \n Note that power given to corporations, as well as the power to make key decisions, is one of the defining traits of traditional corporatism. In Fascist italy they had no such power. \n \n Also from wikpedia:\n \n \nToday, corporatism or neo-corporatism is used in reference to tendencies in politics for legislators and administrations to be influenced or dominated by the interests of business enterprises (limited liability corporations). \n \n \n Again, no such power or influence existed in fascist Italy. Without corporate power, there is no corporatism. Instead you have a corporate state (which does not necessarily denote croporatism) where the corporations are used purely to keep business at odds with labor and to help hand down and enforce edicts of the ruler. \n \n Thats it, there is no more, without corporate power and influence, you can have no corporatism, and you have not shown that the corporate guidls under mussolini had any such power or influence. You have not even showed that there was actualy a merging of corporate power and state power, because there wasn't. State power simply supplanted corporate power and that was the end of things. \n \n Admittedly it seems like a small difference until you consider the implications. Traditional corporatism, with the whole of your population sorted into corporate guilds, and those guilds sharing power with the established state, is actually an early form of democratic thinking. It is not, in fact, that different than the system we have in place right now in the US, only we belong to political parites instead of corporate guilds (oddly engouh, when the church started pushing the theory of corporatism, such guilds were created in a lot of countries, and all survive today as political parties). These guilds would elect representatives who would particiapate in legislative activities. Today our \"Guilds\" are called \"political parties\" and our elected representatives participate in legislative activities are carried out in congress (yes, portions of our political system are based on early christian politics).\n \n That is traditional corporatism. Can you see now why the difference is so important? On the one hand you have a quasi democratic institution, on the other a totalitarian dictatorship. \n \n \nThis is not what I'm talking about, since it's not what Mussolini said. He said Corporatism, but that can also mean corporativism. It's not a mistranslation, it's a different type, according to Historians.\n\n \n since the Italian word for \"corporatism\" is \"corporatism\", since it was an imported theory and thus kept its name (just like a \"ford\" is a \"ford\" even in italy), why do you suppose he didn't just say \"corporatism\"? for that matter, why would the phrase \"corporativism\" have survived at all? It is because theya re 2 seperate words, with two seperate meanings. Corporatism is essentially rule by corporations (though not the type of corporations we have today) while corporativism is absolute rule OF corporations, which as I outlined before, is an entirely seperate concept. Yes, it is simply a sloppy translation.\n \n \n \nOk. This is our misunderstanding. I am not arguing with you about any of that. I am arguing that I am not a fascist in the sense of Mussolini, since in mussolini's government, the State was absolute and merged with corporate interests. That's exactly what I said above: \n \n \n They didn't merge with corporate interests. They exhibited absolute control of corporate interests. This was based largely on utilitarian views. Th theory was largely that if the state could exert complete control over corporate interests, including business and the means of production, they could make great strides froward in production. Rather than having businesses compete with each other, they could rally their resources and use those resources to help society as a whole. Sure you trampled some rights, but it was \"good\" for the state, and thus good for the people.\n \n If you want to see actual corporatism, you have only to look at japan. There are in reality only 6 japanese corporations. Everything else is a division of, or wholly owned subsidery of one of these 6 monster companies. Japanese children are tought loyalty to their corporation starting at birth. Essentially, when the japanese go to work, they are joining thier guild, and since there are really only 6 corporations in the entire nation, and they can count on the absolute support of their people, they wield tremendous power. If you want an interesting read (and fiction to boot, so a fun read), Michael Chreighton worte an excellent book about a murder that talks a lot about Japanese business interests and how they inter relate. Like most of his books, it is well researched. If you ever plan to do business with the Japanese, I wuld suggest reading it. It is every bit as informative as any text book I have eever seen on the subject.\n \n \nI am focusing on how the government controls corporations and melds interests. Corporatism = corporativism according to mainstream. It's a different (not modern) form of Corporatism. I am not talking about Neo-Corporatism. You could very well be right about what modern society is.\n\n \n And I see that as a major porblem with the mainstream. Of course, since the mainstream is almost always composed of laymen, I suppose that it doesn't make that much of a difference. But the differnce between corporatism and corporativism is a huge one, and I think people need to understand that difference.\n \n \n I will get back to the rest of this later. I have a dinner party to get to.",

   " \n No, he didn't. The word was used throughout Italy for many years before mussolini. It was a slightly diffeernt version of classic corporatism.\n\n \n Contrary to mainstream historians. They directly say he coined the term in 1919. IT was an outgrowth of other practices, but most say it was never stated prior.\n \n Sources:\n \n Fascism: A History By Roger Eatwell\n \n The word goes back, but the way in which it was \"modernly\" used in from 1919-43 was coined by Mussolini, according to historians. Note that I said he coined and invented the term. He did. It didn't mean the same thing and it wasn't used as he meant it prior to his involvement, although he did take ideals from other sources.\n \n The term originated (not in it's entire form) in the very late 19th century and was coined by the Fascists in the early 20th century.\n \n \" Mussolini founded the fascist movement on March 23, 1919, ... [and] Italian Fascism was, in many respects, an adverse reaction to both the apparent failure of laissez-faire economics and fear of the Left. Trends in intellectual history, such as the breakdown of positivism and the general fatalism of postwar Europe, were also a concern. Fascism was, to an extent, a product of a general feeling of anxiety and fear among the middle class of postwar Italy.\n \n It's interesting to note that it was a reactionary fear of the left, becaues the original word from which Fascism was derrived was used to describe a radial  left-wing  political movement. Fascism as Mussolini saw it was coined in 1919. As he saw it, it ceased to even have the same meanining as Fasci*\n \n Since our sources seem to say different things, it's probably a matter of semantics. Im not saying he invented the word Fascism. I am saying he invented the meaning as we see it, as most historians agree. It's obvious since his definition is the opposite of the orginal definition.\n \n \n And I see that as a major porblem with the mainstream. Of course, since the mainstream is almost always composed of laymen, I suppose that it doesn't make that much of a difference. But the differnce between corporatism and corporativism is a huge one, and I think people need to understand that difference.\n \n\n \n There is a problem, and it's semantic. Historians or the \"laymen\" as you call them, as well as historical economists  do consider the differences between Corporatism and Corporativism. That's why they make it distinct and clear that there are multiple versions of Corporatism. The type they are referring to is Corporativism. I know, and they know, that neo as well as classical corporatism aren't the same.\n \n They need to be more clear. IMO, they should just use  corporativism. , but they don't, and I have to go by what they say and what is commonly used. Different fields of study. I do recognize, though, what you are talking about in Political Science.\n \n \n They didn't merge with corporate interests.\n\n \n According to Mussolini, they did. That was  his  definition of merging and that's what most historians agree with. I have no real choice but to support the mainstream and Mussolini's comment. I see, much like he and mainstream, controlling the corpororations as brining their interests together. \n \n \n\n They exhibited absolute control of corporate interests.\n \n \n Then why did he explicity say it's the merger of corporate and state interests? Did he not mean exactly what he said? I will explain why:\n \n They make their interests state interests. And the primary motivation of Bussinesses are profits, THis can still be massively achieved, but the state merges with it. This is the direct wording of Mussolini [B] \"Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power.\" -- Benito Mussolini \n \n They are merging because they are bringing them together UNDER state control. You need not have a perfectly balanced UNION or merger. This isn't a symbiosis in which each gains perfect balance in the marginal analysis.\n \n According to the dictionary, merger can mean many things. \n \n 1. Combination\n 2. Union \n 3. Absorption into one.\n \n THe intersets of a company is to make money, they  do make  money when they are absorbed into the interests of the state, just like what happened in Nazi Germany. Businesses make tons of cash off of Fascist Governments, because they are highly focused on a perverted capitalism.\n \n \n \n\n If you want to see actual corporatism, you have only to look at japan. There are in reality only 6 japanese corporations. Everything else is a division of, or wholly owned subsidery of one of these 6 monster companies. Japanese children are tought loyalty to their corporation starting at birth. Essentially, when the japanese go to work, they are joining thier guild, and since there are really only 6 corporations in the entire nation, and they can count on the absolute support of their people, they wield tremendous power.\n\n \n I agree with you. That is a form of Corporatism. THe difference is that in that form, the corporation owns you. In the other form, corporativism, the units are still merged, by they are inversed. Instead of the corporation influencing the government, the Government takes over the industry. They're still technically combined, made a union, absorbed, but in a different order.\n \n \n since the Italian word for \"corporatism\" is \"corporatism\", since it was an imported theory and thus kept its name (just like a \"ford\" is a \"ford\" even in italy), why do you suppose he didn't just say \"corporatism\"? for that matter, why would the phrase \"corporativism\" have survived at all? It is because theya re 2 seperate words, with two seperate meanings. Corporatism is essentially rule by corporations (though not the type of corporations we have today) while corporativism is absolute rule OF corporations, which as I outlined before, is an entirely seperate concept. Yes, it is simply a sloppy translation.\n\n \n A lot of historical analysis is post-hoc. It is now, like in many other situations, concluded that they are one and the same from a sematic point of view, since now many types of corporatism are acknowledged. Corporativism is a different type.\n \n The reason why corporativism survived is because it's unique from other versions of COrporatism. He used that because it better describes his goal, his aims. Even historically, it's good. People do acknowledge the differences between teh many faces of Corporatism. There are several types of Communism, and socialism, and democracy as well. They are just different subsets.\n \n \n This was based largely on utilitarian views. Th theory was largely that if the state could exert complete control over corporate interests, including business and the means of production, they could make great strides froward in production. Rather than having businesses compete with each other, they could rally their resources and use those resources to help society as a whole. Sure you trampled some rights, but it was \"good\" for the state, and thus good for the people.\n\n \n Was it really good for the people to have such a policy? How happy did it make them? How good was said society? It wouldn't stand up to even a modern utilitarian calculation. You can have a theory based on utility, but that doesn't mean it's actually utilitarian. Competition is superior in the market because it produces better quality products and cheaper prices, which make people happier than having government monopoly and stagnation.\n \n Utility is also not served depending on what rights you violate. There is a hierarchy according to many ethicists. What's good for the state isn't necessarily good for the people. This is a problem for Fascism and Communism; their asumptionts aren't always true.\n \n A seatbelt rule  IS  beneficial to everyone, and it comes at a low cost in a Utility-calculation, whereas Fascist and Communist violations of the market and freedoms are not. For example: I don't believe that the rights-violations used by the Patriot Act were worth the good they somehow dubiously could do. IN the calculation, the potential problems of such practices are (through utilitarian calculation) outweighed by the negatives and potential abuses.\n \n You really have to look at what is being done and what it could lead to. It's a very slippery slope to say that government rules that actually, concretely protect lives at a low rights-cost, is Fascist. Rights aren't 100% anyway, since they are very weak from an Objective Ethical standpoint. \n \n Seatbelts save lives of people--even the people who aren't in the car and they help prevent property damage. The same can be said of Speedlimits. YEs, they violate your freedom of movement and they tell you what to do. You shouldn't be told not to go so fast, you should be smart enough to KNOW that you can only handle so much speed. \n \n The problem is that most people are too stupid to do this and they need the government to tell them. Many also don't give two-**** 's about hurting anyone else or maintaining control over their vehicle.\n \n You are also on Federal and State roads, so if you want the privledge of driving on them, you follow the rules. \n \n I would not go to an airport and refuse to be searched as i go thorugh a metal detector. It's their building, their property, and I am allowed the privedge to use it. I have to follow their safety precautions. \n \n Seatbelts, Speed limits etc are measures government creates to serve  Utility  and it's a balacing game of rights/vs greater good. Ironically, however, Rights ARE considered under Utility as a major rule. Society's don't work without some respect for rights. They tend to produce mass unhappiness and later damage.\n \n \n Again, no such power or influence existed in fascist Italy.\n\n \n That's because the version of Corporatism used by Italy isn't modern or classical. They gave it a unique characteristic.\n \n \n\n Without corporate power, there is no corporatism. Instead you have a corporate state (which does not necessarily denote croporatism)\n\n \n I know what you are saying, but most AUthorities on the measure disagree. They give it the term Corporativism/Corporatism. I am not going to go against it, because im not qualified to invalidate the research and history as well as what we learn in Political Science. I can only go by what the prevelant method and research is, just like I would appeal to the mainstream science community and journals. There are people who disagree in those fields as well, but I go by the majority scientific opinion just as I go by the majority historical opinion. It's nothing against you in particular.\n \n \n\n You have not even showed that there was actualy a merging of corporate power and state power, because there wasn't. State power simply supplanted corporate power and that was the end of things.\n\n \n State power [B] was the corporate[B] power. They had vested interests in them.\n \n I have shown that's what Mussolini stated Fascism is and I have provided mainstream sources of History. That's all I really need to do. Merging means union, combination, absorption into one. THe government took over the corporations and organized people into little guilds for organization. Again, a merger doesn't mean you have to have equal benefit or control. One can dominate the other. It's merely a union, a combination, and an absorbtion.\n \n One probably reason why Mussolini used incorrect and perverted terms was because he flip-flopped half the time. He started off as a left-wing socialist, a marxist, and then he used left-wing terminiology, and then all of the sudden he took a different turn due to complications and disagreements, taking with him some of tha tterminology but putting different meaning behind it all.\n \n http://www.la-articles.org.uk/fascism.htm\n \n \n Fascism is capitalism with the mask off. It's a tool of Big Business, which rules through democracy until it feels mortally threatened, then unleashes fascism.\n\n \n \n Mussolini and Hitler were put into power by Big Business, because Big Business was challenged by the revolutionary working class. \n\n \n \n It relies on hymn-singing, flag-waving, and other mummery, which are nothing more than irrational devices employed by the Fascist leaders who have been paid by Big Business to manipulate the masses.\n\n \n \n Fascism was a doctrine well elaborated years before it was named. The core of the Fascist movement launched officially in the Piazza San Sepolcro on 23rd March 1919 was an intellectual and organizational tradition called \"national syndicalism.\"\n\n \n \n Fascist regime moved towards a highly interventionist policy, and Fascist pronouncements increasingly harped on the \"corporate state.\" All traces of liberism were lost, save only for the insistence that actual nationalization be avoided.\n\n \n \n As for Fascism's economic performance, a purely empirical test of results is inconclusive. In its first few years, the Mussolini government's economic measures were probably more liberalizing than restrictive. The subsequent turn to intrusive corporatism was swiftly followed by the world slump and then the war.\n\n \n Fascism has come to be a weird puzzle. Mainstream sources compete with other mainstream sources adn they all give different, altered versions. \n \n \n That is traditional corporatism. Can you see now why the difference is so important? On the one hand you have a quasi democratic institution, on the other a totalitarian dictatorship.[/quote]\n \n Yes, one is a totalitarian dictatorship and it's not modern corporatism. I never said it was modern corporatism.\n \n I am only using the accepted historical term for what Fascist Italty was.\n \n \n \n You are missing the point. Fascism was not corporatism by any definition of the word because, while it was certainly a corporative state, the corporations lacked any power at all. All power belonged to the state.\n \n \n \n Quote:\n Look above at most of the souces: You also ignored the source above which stated there's a clear difference between Neo-Corporatism and Fascist Corporatism and classical Corporatism.\n \n \n Thats becuase what is being refered to as \"Fascist corporatism\" is not. It is corporativism, which is an entirely different monster. This seems to have been shown rather clearly by now (since every definition of corporatism involves at least some degree of power being held by the corporate interests, while in corporativism there is absolutly NO power held by the corporate interests).\n \n Quote:\n Neo-Corporatism I am not even concerning, since it's totally irrelevant to what I am talking about. It's clearly not the same as what Mussolini was referring to, since it's stated as such.\n \n IMPORTANT NOTE** Italian corporatism IS corporativism\n \n historychannel.com\n \n A. political stance or system of government resembling Mussolini's, as further ... Historically,\n corporatism or corporativism (Italian corporativismo). They referr to it as the same entity, and it's different from the 19th century and modern corporatism.\n \n You're problem is with mainstream, not me.\n \n \n Note a distinction is made here between corporatism and corporativismo, they are not referring to it as the same entity or they would not have bothered to make the distinction.\n\n \n Some sources do state that the government didn't completey take over the corporations and actually avoided nationaliztion. I am not missing the key point. I am merely stating what historians and the dictionary and the encyclopedia are saying about Fascism and Corporativism/Corporatism. If they consistantly say that Corporativism is corporatism, I can't argue with them. THey are accepted academic authorities. It's not clear now, nor will it ever be clear, because they deliberately link the two together and state that Fascist Italy was such. SOme sources say Businesses were totally nationalized and the State-power was supreme, some say the opposite.\n \n Many agree that the state and bussiness were merged into one cohesive unit under Government control. This is what they mean by a merger, and such a thing is supported by Mussolini himself, through is own words.\n \n I can't imagine why so many of mainstream poli-sci academics and credible historians and sources say the opposite of what you do. I doubt they are wrong, since their ideas have withstood tested review. \n \n Just for kicks: I just did a search in an ENGLISH to Italian dictionary for the word Corporatism, and it came up with:\n \n corporatism\n corporativism\n noun\n \n 1. politics.\n The control of a country's economy by groups of producers who have the authority to implement social and economic policies, while abiding by the principles laid down by the government.\n \n \n According to meriam Webster, not an italian dictionary translation: \n \n One entry found for corporativism.\n Main Entry: cor\u00b7po\u00b7ra\u00b7tiv\u00b7ism\n Pronunciation: 'kor-p&-\"rA-ti-\"vi-z&m, -p(&-)r&-\n Function: noun\n : CORPORATISM \n \n Has the same damn definition, so, I am thinking mainstream and history works differently than Poli-sci, but even that is weird, since my poli sci book says the same thing about Fascism and Corporatism/Corporativism. \n \n In this case of Fascist Itality, the government was the producers because it controlled everything (supposedly) and the units under control implemeted social and economic policies according to government regulations. This was easy, because everything was the government, so they were only abiding by their own rules and regulations while pumping put products and policies. THe state and businesses were one, the state was the controler of producers.\n \n Every dictionary I see says the same thing about Corporativism/Corporatism.\n \n I don't think we are going to get anywhere, since we have conflicting sources that are mainstream.\n \n If you are saying that Fascism is corporativism, and you agree that's what Mussolini says, then you have to accept that corporativism = the translation corporatism. Every dictionary is like that and most encyclopedias.\n \n \n Corporatism is also used in reference to tendencies in politics for legislators and administrations to be influenced or dominated by the interests of corporations rather than citizens. In this view, government decisions are seen as being influenced strongly by which sorts of policies will lead to greater profits for favored companies.\n\n \n The above quote is not what Mussolini-esqu corporatism and it's not Corporativism. They make a distinction between what he did and either of those, actually. This would be a Corporatocracy or a corporate republic etc.\n \n Mussolini had a corporatist state and a corporativism, which IS a corporatism form. It's where one group, often unelected, holds control over government. certain unelected bodies take a critical role in the decision-making process. This original meaning was not connected with the specific notion of a business corporation, being a rather more general reference to any incorporated body.. It wasn't always a business that was in control. It could be any incorporated body. The governmetn assumed this role under a fascade of big business and worker guilds.\n \n http://explanation-guide.info/meaning/Corporatism.html\n \n \n Mussolini divided the nation up into about 22 different corporations, or unit guilds representitive of their industries. The term corporation isn't exactly the same as the modern version of a Corporation: this is why it's called corporativism, a different type of corporatism. Remember: corporations aren't necessarily businesses. I think you are confusing the definition of corporation and thinking it only means business.\n \n And you said earlier that he didn't give power to corporations, when he actually did. 22 of them in fact.",

The single defining charachteristic of corporatism, corporate power, was entirely lacking, in fact the exact opposite existed, which was totalt corporate subservience, and you and apparently several other historians, wish to argue that this was corporatism, despite sharing very few traits and being called by a different name.\n \n Ok, I guess. I will go feed my ducks now. They have 4 legs, and fur instead of feathers, and no wings, but they do breathe, which is close enough for me!\n \n I have, in my entire life, never heard anybody well versed in poly sci refer to corporativism as corporatism. They are two seperate terms which indicate two seperate systems. \n \n \nThey need to be more clear.

I do recognize, though, what you are talking about in Political Science.\n\n \n Cool, then we can agree to disagree and all is good. And yes, historians would be some of the laymen I was referring to. In a discussion of political systems, they are generally hardly qualified as experts. I have met a couple who are the exception. they refer to themselves as \"political historians\". I am not entirely certain what makes them any different since your typrical poli sci type, since they were apprently just historians who specialised in studying different political systems in history, which exactly what poli sci is all about, but hey, whatever floats their boat.\n \n \n \n \nA lot of historical analysis is post-hoc. It is now, like in many other situations, concluded that they are one and the same from a sematic point of view, since now many types of corporatism are acknowledged. Corporativism is a different type.\n\n \n Only to a historian. I think anybody else would look at the fact that the two systems were virtual opposites and draw a different conclusion.\n \n \nThe reason why corporativism survived is because it's unique from other versions of COrporatism. He used that because it better describes his goal, his aims. Even historically, it's good. People do acknowledge the differences between teh many faces of Corporatism. There are several types of Communism, and socialism, and democracy as well. They are just different subsets.\n\n \n It survived because poli sci types kept it alive, you seldom see the term in a history book, and when you do it is generally used interchangibly with corporatism (though they are nowhere close to the same thing). Historians do this quite often. History texts are full of glaring errors when it comes to politics and political systems. \n \n \n \nWas it really good for the people to have such a policy? How happy did it make them? How good was said society? It wouldn't stand up to even a modern utilitarian calculation. You can have a theory based on utility, but that doesn't mean it's actually utilitarian. Competition is superior in the market because it produces better quality products and cheaper prices, which make people happier than having government monopoly and stagnation.\n\n \n From a strictly utilitarian viewpoint, it was a wise move. Witht he governemtn controlling industry completley, you didn't need competition to provide innovation adn cheap prices. The governemnt simply mandated both, and the problem was solved. Instead of a disorderly method of improvement and competition, the government could ensure that everybody was working to provide cost saving innovations and striving to provide the best product possible at the lowest cost.\n \n \nUtility is also not served depending on what rights you violate. There is a hierarchy according to many ethicists. What's good for the state isn't necessarily good for the people. This is a problem for Fascism and Communism; their asumptionts aren't always true.\n\n \n But they were. Under both socialism and fascism (we don't know about communism, since communism has never been practiced....another of those fallacies regarding poilitical systems passed on by historians) the leaders were honestly striving to do what they felt was best for the people as a whole. As far as \"rights violated\", under both systems, the majority of people did not feel tehir rights were being violated. Italians under Mussolini felt that they were some of the freeest people on the planet. When they enetered WWII, they were not conquering or invading, they were liberating, so people in these other nations could enjoy the same freedoms that they did. \n \n This is why such things are important, and why the personal liberty view of politics is superior to any other. I took a trip one time to the USSR (back in the old days when they were still socialists). I was provided a couple of body guards (who in reality were most likely either KGB or GRU) and I asked them one day when we had some time to burn for a tour. They took me around and showed me some of the wonders of the soviet union. One thing they showed me was an apartment complex that had just been \"completed\". They were built of brick and despite the fact they were only a couple of months old the walls were already falling apart becaue somebody had stolen 3/4 of the masonry cement that was used to mix the mortar. There were a couple of outhouses and a couple of garden spigots in the courtyard that everybody in the complex used because the pipe and the plumbing fixtures had never shown up. My training and experiance in the construction industry led me to decline the offer of an interior tour, because it was obvious that the place could collapse at any moment. It was held together by gravity and fond wishes. \n \n It was the pride in their eyes and voices as they showed me these ramshackle dumps that I would not let my dogs live in that caught my attention the most. After several minutes of conversation it became clear that in these guys minds, these were virtual palaces, luxury town homes. they knew that thre was no plumbing, and they knew that the walls were badly cracked (ins some cases so bad that they were stuffed with newspapaer to keep the weather on the outside). These things were no big deal in the minds of the people. They were unimportant. Neither the white house nor the presidential suite at the ritz would have seemed more luxurious to them. \n \n That is because, like fascism, socialism was not merely a system, it was an entire mind set. To look at the peoples grand apartments and see anything but absolute splendor would have been unthinkable. To voice those opinions would have meant prison or death.\n \n In a free society, the first, and really only, freedom is that to think for ones self, and to make decisions based on your own conclusions. I believe Orwell stated it best in 1984 \"Freedom is the freedom to say that 2+2=4\". \n \n Free societies will always have those who make the wrong choice, people who choose not to wear their seatbelt and end up flying through the windshield, people who choose to take a gun and shoot up a schoolyard full of children. These are the exception, not the rule. We tolerate such things because it is not worth the loss of rights that would be involved in abolishing them completely. \n \n Both fascism and soviet socialism relied VERY heavily on utilitarinaism. Mussolini did everything he ever did for \"the people\". Everybody who dies under the reign of Stalin was the result of a utilitarinist decision. They died to protect \"the people\" and to provide happiness for \"the people\". Stalin was a true believer, as was Mussolini. These guyw were not megalomaniacs like hitler who were using a semi imaginary cause to consolidate personal power. \n \n What you are essentially saying is that Fascism and soviet socialism failed as political systems because the right people werent in charge. \n \n \nA seatbelt rule  IS  beneficial to everyone, and it comes at a low cost in a Utility-calculation, whereas Fascist and Communist violations of the market and freedoms are not. For example: I don't believe that the rights-violations used by the Patriot Act were worth the good they somehow dubiously could do. IN the calculation, the potential problems of such practices are (through utilitarian calculation) outweighed by the negatives and potential abuses.\n\n \n Lets consider for a moment and do some real calculation. Assuming that 300,000,000 people travel daily in America, and enter and exit their vehicles 3 times per day. Assume that it takes an average of 30 secods per time that they enter and exit their vehicle to put on their seat belts (becuase while it may take a normal, healthy adult only a few seconds to put on their seat belt and take it back off, older people are slower, and fighting a 2 yr old into a seatbelt can take up to a minute). 300 million people x 30 seconds= 9,000,000,000 x 3 (the numer of times they travel in a vehicle per day)= 27,000,000,000 / 60 (second in a minute) = 450,000,000 / 60 (minutes in an hour) = 7,500,000. 7.5 million man hours PER DAY is what you have just legislated away, not to mention the freedom of choice, upon which all freedom is based. And what exactly is your return on this? \n \n On the other hand, the provisions of the patriot act are likely to affact what?, maybe 1% of the population, not to mention that any loss is likely to be made up through gains made by time saved by law enforcement personell. From a utilitarian standpoint, privacy rights, right to trial, freedom of speach, etc... are nightmares. \n \n \nYou really have to look at what is being done and what it could lead to. It's a very slippery slope to say that government rules that actually, concretely protect lives at a low rights-cost, is Fascist. Rights aren't 100% anyway, since they are very weak from an Objective Ethical standpoint. \n \n \n From a practical standpoint, there are much better measures that would serve better to serve this viewpoint, like the removal of the right to a jury, which is incredibly expansive in most cases and doesn't really serve much function. A judge can do just as well. And from a utilitarian standpoint, why does the accused need a right to an attorney? It is a waste of man hours since the accused has to be there anyway, he should lodge his own defense. \n \n Your tyoe of thinking on the seatbelt thing is dangerous because it is more than simply giving up a little bit of freedom for a whole lot of benifit, it is a change in mindset, which at the end of the day is all that any political system is based on. By your thoughts, we should be willing to give up some little rights for the common good. Once the people get used to doing this, the number and scale of rights to be surrendered for the common good go up. They always have and they always will. This is how nearly every tyrant in history has come to power.\n \n Look at gun control. Originally, American citizens enjoyed the right to own any weapon they felt compelled to own. you could buy hand grenades and machine guns through the mail. In fact, prior to the NFA, more machine guns were sold to civilians than to citizens. The right to keep an bear arms was seen as absolute. The NFA came to pass, despite the fat that even those who sponsered it considered it unconstitutional, but it managed to remain on the books primarily through failure to prosecute people who challenged in court as being unconstitutional (thus keeping it out of the supreme court). In a relatively shor time, we wnet from a nation where the people were unquestionably better armed than the governemtn to one where there are outright bans on guns in some parts of the country, and fairly draconian measures at the federal level that effect the whole nation. \n \n This is the result in a change in thoguht process over the years. The NFA was seen as a fairly slight infringement of rights. Then another fairly slight infringement took place, then another, until the RKBA in this nation as it was originally understood has almost completely vanished. At one time it was illegal in new york city for a police officer to ask a citizen if they owned a firearm. Now it is illegal in new york city to OWN most firearm, and registration witht he police is required. The slippery slope does certainly exist, and I can clearly demonstrate it in regards to every totalitarin government that ever exited on our planet.\n \n \n \nSeatbelts save lives of people--even the people who aren't in the car and they help prevent property damage. The same can be said of Speedlimits. YEs, they violate your freedom of movement and they tell you what to do. You shouldn't be told not to go so fast, you should be smart enough to KNOW that you can only handle so much speed. \n \n \n Sorry, can you provide a couple of examples of this? I have been a volunteer firefighter/paramedic since I was 18. My father was the frichief of a fair sized town for nearly 15 years, and a volunteer there for 20 years before that. I have seen literally thousands of car wrecks, and literally hundreds of fatialities. He, too has seen thousands of car wrecks, and probably thousands of fatalities, and neitehr of us has EVER seen a case as you outlined above, where failure of an individual to wear a seatbelt seriously injured or killed anybody but that person.\n \n My father was one of the folks who fought VERY HARD to get the original seatbel laws in our state passed (not because he really cared about adults wearing seat belts, but because child restraints were part of the bill, and he and I were both tired of scraping 2 yr olds off the pavement whose parents were too ignorant to put them in a safety seat). The original bill required that everybody in the vehicle wear a safety belt, and that any infant or toddler under 80 lbs be strapped in an apporved child safety seat. The bill was later ammended (before it was passed) so that only the driver was required to wear a saftey belt because NO evidence could be found that suggested that anybody but the driver wearing a seatbelt had any bearing on survivalbilty or serious injury fro anybody but the singular individual who failed to wear the safety belt. \n \n There was quite a bit of anecdotal evidence presented, and even a few pseudo studies, but every one of the studies was easily discredited, and the vast majoruty of anecdotal evidence either could not be corroborated or was proven to be a fabrication. There was simply not enough evidence in existance to prove it was an issue at all. So, what passed was a bill requiring the driver to wear a setbelt, since there was presentable evidence that the driver wearing a seatbelt made an impact.\n \n \nThe problem is that most people are too stupid to do this and they need the government to tell them. Many also don't give two-**** 's about hurting anyone else or maintaining control over their vehicle.\n\n \n Kind of like the people of Russia were too stupid to manage their own money, and those controlling the industrial mechanisms of italy were too stupid to manage their businesses to the best advantage? Or like the millions that stalin had put to death because they were too stupid to understand and embrace the ideals of socialism?\n \n According to the CDC, in 2003, there were 41,000 deaths and 500,000 hospitalizations as the result of vehicular accidents. So you are looking at 541,000 total injured/killed. Lets be EXTREMELY generous and say that 30% more people would have been injured or killed wihtout seat belt laws (the 30% is the differnece in injuries and death following the enactment of Illinois seat belt laws....it was the highest in the nations. Iowa and Ks showed only a 5% difference). That would give us 703,300 deaths or serious injuries per year. Permanent population of the US in 2003 was 293,027,571. 703,300 / 293,027,571 = roughly .0024, or .24 percent (less than one quarter of one percent). So, you are talking about limiting the rights of 293,027,571 people in response to the potential injury or death of 0.24% of our population?\n \n This is like gun control. The numbers involved are so small that in reality they are inconsequential, but people (like you) are shouting to limit the rights of EVERY american in order to \"save\" a small fraction of a percentage point of our population. \n \n You say that anybody who doesn't wear a seatbelt is an idiot, but the numbers say differently. It is a calculated risk, and the odds are so INCREDIBLY stacked in your favor that it would be easier to argue that anybody who DOES spend the time to put on a seatbelt is an idot who is wasting their time.\n \n \nYou are also on Federal and State roads, so if you want the privledge of driving on them, you follow the rules. \n \n \n This is the worst argument I have seen you use on ANYTHING. The federal governemtn has no money. The state governemtn has no money. They have no land and no posessions. Everything that is the \"property\" of the governemtn is the property of the citizens of the US. \n \n \nI would not go to an airport and refuse to be searched as i go thorugh a metal detector. It's their building, their property, and I am allowed the privedge to use it. I have to follow their safety precautions. \n \n \n When talkign abotu a privatly owned airport or the security provisions of a private ariline, yes. This is not what you are talking about. You are talking about PUBLIC PROPERTY, which is called PUBLIC PROPERTY fro a reason. It is owned by the PUBLIC.\n \n \nSeatbelts, Speed limits etc are measures government creates to serve  Utility  and it's a balacing game of rights/vs greater good. Ironically, however, Rights ARE considered under Utility as a major rule. Society's don't work without some respect for rights. They tend to produce mass unhappiness and later damage.\n\n \n Every totalitarian regime in history has started by asking for just a few rights in return for the common good. As I demonstrated mathematically above, the \"rights for the common good\" equasion is almost always weighted heavily so you are asking a whole lot of folks to give up rights to serve a select few, if any at all.",

   " \n So what youa re saying is that the practice of corporativism, which bears no resembelenace to any form of corporatism before it, and no resembelence to any form of corporatism following it, and was called by a different name, is the same?\n \n All you have demonstrated here is the ignorance of many historians when it comes to political matters. the difference was HUGE and well documented. The single defining charachteristic of corporatism, corporate power, was entirely lacking, in fact the exact opposite existed, which was totalt corporate subservience, and you and apparently several other historians, wish to argue that this was corporatism, despite sharing very few traits and being called by a different name.\n \n Ok, I guess. I will go feed my ducks now. They have 4 legs, and fur instead of feathers, and no wings, but they do breathe, which is close enough for me!\n \n I have, in my entire life, never heard anybody well versed in poly sci refer to corporativism as corporatism. They are two seperate terms which indicate two seperate systems.\n\n \n Since most sources, both historical, dictionaries, (even italian dictionaries!) and encyclopedias agree that corporativism = corporatism, and Mussolini himself stated that he merged corporations and state, I have to agree. But, on the other hand, corporations don't automatically = businesses. I don't know what point of view you are taking on this. Mussolini did create subdivisions of 22 guilds, which are also called corporations. The government had control of these, but they were given token legislative power.\n \n I can't remember if it were you or someone else, but someone said that Mussolini ever gave power to corporations, which according to Wikipedia, they did. But I won't say any more on this, since I have never seen in any of my classes a division between vism and ism, except that vism is a different breed of ism.\n \n Hell, whenever I type corporativismo into my italian dictionary, I get corporatism/corporativism. I haven't really heard too much good about the Poli-sci curriculum, but I am sure it's just propaganda. I don't know. I haven't really had that high of an opinion of them as you probably don't about Historians. Inter-disciplinary rivalry :p \n \n \n Kind of like the people of Russia were too stupid to manage their own money, and those controlling the industrial mechanisms of italy were too stupid to manage their businesses to the best advantage? Or like the millions that stalin had put to death because they were too stupid to understand and embrace the ideals of socialism?\n\n \n No. Not like those people at all. It's more only geared toward people who obviously cannot display enough intelligence to not engage in activities which harm others mentally/physically. They have no regard for others.\n \n \n ccording to the CDC, in 2003, there were 41,000 deaths and 500,000 hospitalizations as the result of vehicular accidents. So you are looking at 541,000 total injured/killed. Lets be EXTREMELY generous and say that 30% more people would have been injured or killed wihtout seat belt laws (the 30% is the differnece in injuries and death following the enactment of Illinois seat belt laws....it was the highest in the nations. Iowa and Ks showed only a 5% difference). That would give us 703,300 deaths or serious injuries per year. Permanent population of the US in 2003 was 293,027,571. 703,300 / 293,027,571 = roughly .0024, or .24 percent (less than one quarter of one percent). So, you are talking about limiting the rights of 293,027,571 people in response to the potential injury or death of 0.24% of our population?\n\n \n It saves their lives and it saves hospitilzation costs and time. Lives are worth more than such a petty right which leads to harm in the first place, in my opinion. I think of the people, then their families who are affect, then the friends of that individual. I then think of the people who have to watch it, the hospitals, the medics, and the emergency personnel. More people are affected--not just the idiot who didn't wear his seatbelt.\n \n  It is estimated that seatbelts save approximately 10,000 lives per year. But it remains true that the majority of deaths and serious injuries from automobile accidents are a result of people not wearing seatbelts.\n \n  Americans pay billions of dollars each year in injury-related costs for people who don't wear seatbelts.\n \n  Targeting messages toward adult seatbelt use. Children mirror adult behavior; when a driver is buckled, 94% of the time the children riding in that vehicle are buckled.\n \n Using your seatbelt, or being made to, creates and instills a higher level of virtue in younger children. They tend to mirrior the adult behavior, using seatbelts is good, intelligent behavior (that many wouldn't do if it weren't a law and propagandized).\n \n \n his is like gun control. The numbers involved are so small that in reality they are inconsequential, but people (like you) are shouting to limit the rights of EVERY american in order to \"save\" a small fraction of a percentage point of our population.\n\n \n I am not for making weapons illegal. There are many postive utilitarian arguments for it that have nothing to do with rights.\n \n \n You say that anybody who doesn't wear a seatbelt is an idiot, but the numbers say differently. It is a calculated risk, and the odds are so INCREDIBLY stacked in your favor that it would be easier to argue that anybody who DOES spend the time to put on a seatbelt is an idot who is wasting their time.\n\n \n Engaging in behavior that deliberatly can lead to your death and harm others potentially, and behavior that badly reflects on your children is not intelligent. I found it most ironic that the college student tauting his freedoms and violations by the big bad gub'ment got his XXX killed. Not only did he destroy his own life, he had 0 consideration for his family and friends. He also became a cost to his parents, who now have to pay for his funeral unnecessarily.\n \n As I said earlier, XXXXXX like him are immoral, selfish objectivists who have no concern for anyone else but themselves.\n \n \n This is the worst argument I have seen you use on ANYTHING. The federal governemtn has no money. The state governemtn has no money. They have no land and no posessions. Everything that is the \"property\" of the governemtn is the property of the citizens of the US.\n\n \n Driving is not a right, but a privledge. YOu need a license to do it. If you want to use the roads the government builds, you obey the laws. If you don't want to, you don't need to drive on them. The federal government taxes the people to pay for roads. It's the government's responsibility to see that the roads operate efficiently and safely. If you are on public property administered by the government, you follow it's rules.\n \n \n \n Every totalitarian regime in history has started by asking for just a few rights in return for the common good. As I demonstrated mathematically above, the \"rights for the common good\" equasion is almost always weighted heavily so you are asking a whole lot of folks to give up rights to serve a select few, if any at all.\n\n \n Certain rights cannot be taken away, because they tend to create a socially damaging negative utility. This is where I draw the line. I believe that the good of the many outweigh the good of the few, when the \"good\" involves concrete lives and costs. Other than that, I don't give a rats XXX what the people do in their own homes.\n \n You have to separate totalitarian rights taken away from legitimate concerns. These speed and belt laws aren't malicious. It's obvious. You stop them when they become malicious.\n \n \n It is a calculated risk, and the odds are so INCREDIBLY stacked in your favor that it would be easier to argue that anybody who DOES spend the time to put on a seatbelt is an idot who is wasting their time.\n\n \n I beg to differ. The potential (and real) damage compared to the laughably minor infraction is not a rational risk to take. Many problems are caused by not-wearing seatbelts. That's why the laws are in place. The fact that one major case just occured is pure irony, and quite funny. \n \n The problem with this brand of Libertarian thinking is: OH, it will never happen to me and my family, or Oh, I won't be a burden, so \"screw that **** and **** da gub'ment.\" Then you die and ...it's...too late. What could possibly have saved me, my family, and my money...snap click! Perhaps I was too stupid to just...do it. \n \n People aren't smart in general. Polls prove that. Most of the american population is extremly stupid and socially backward. Maybe if people were smarter they could do more stuff for themselves. I am not saying YOU are stupid. I don't know what you do in your private life. I go by statistics.\n \n \n \n # Three of five people killed in vehicle accidents would have survived their injuries had they been wearing their seat belts. (Source: NHTSA)\n # Seat belts save an estimated 9,500 lives in the United States each year. (Source: NHTSA)\n # Every 12 seconds, someone is killed in a traffic accident. (Source: NHTSA)\n\n \n http://www.californiaautoinsurance.net/seatbelts.htm\n \n \n Over recent years, approximately one in every five motor vehicle occupants killed on our roads were unbelted, with a higher proportion of rear seated passengers killed in accidents unbelted, compared to drivers and front left passengers.\n\n \n http://www.tacsafety.com.au/jsp/content/NavigationController.do?areaID=12&tierID=1&navID=12348A44&navLink=null&pageID=168\n \n \n Many unbelted vehicle occupants killed are intoxicated. Of the 35 drivers and passengers killed in 2003 who were not wearing a seat belt and whose BAC reading was known, 51% were intoxicated.\n\n \n Many people who don't wear their belts are usually intoxicated, according to statics. They are hardly rational people, but they are exercising their freedom----to be stupid.\n \n http://www.edgarsnyder.com/news/seatbelts/seat-belts-statistics.html\n \n \n # In 2002, 42,850 people died in traffic accidents. Of that number, 19,103 were not wearing seat belts.\n # 4,200 lives could be saved each year if 90% of the U.S. population wore seat belts.\n\n \n Tell \"such few thousands of lives don't matter\" to their families, friends. It's immoral to condone such behavior.\n \n \n Fatalities and accidents involving those not wearing seat belts costs the U.S. approximately $20 billion per year. Of that cost, 74% of the tab is paid for by the public.\n\n \n They are costing the public atrocious wastes of money. Again, very immoral due to their utter lack of regard and stupidity (characteristic of Randroid Objectivists).\n \n \n \n Driver deaths have been reduced by 14% and passenger deaths reduced by 11%. When combined with the proper use of a\n seatbelt it reduces the risk for serious head injuries by 75%. Where seatbelts alone have a 38% risk factor.\n \n\n \n sometimes, even though people wear seatbelts, the death rate increases: why? alcohol and speeding are the two worst factors. Both of which, are..illegal. XXXXXX also not stopping at stopsigns and side impacting people is another concern. Pedestrians are also counted in deaths from accidents.\n The cost in lives, material, and money greatly oughtweight the right \"not to be told what to do.\" Especially since rights based ethics is fairly weak.\n \n \n \n Sorry, can you provide a couple of examples of this? I have been a volunteer firefighter/paramedic since I was 18. My father was the frichief of a fair sized town for nearly 15 years, and a volunteer there for 20 years before that. I have seen literally thousands of car wrecks, and literally hundreds of fatialities. He, too has seen thousands of car wrecks, and probably thousands of fatalities, and neitehr of us has EVER seen a case as you outlined above, where failure of an individual to wear a seatbelt seriously injured or killed anybody but that person.\n\n \n Not wearing your seat belt, if you are the driver poses many problems. Foremost, the seatbelt keeps you harnessed into your seat and prevents movement, which in turn makes you more capable, especially under fast or dangerous conditions, to handle your vehicle. If you get into an accident or try to avoid one, you can easily tip, flip your vehicle depending on what type it is, or you can swerve, throwing people around in your car injuring them.\n \n It's is also quite well documented that people have been totally ejected from their cars and sent hurtingly at 40 MPH out onto Federal Property. It's quite easy to hit someone or something else if anyone is unlucky enough to be anywhere near.\n \n \n My father was one of the folks who fought VERY HARD to get the original seatbel laws in our state passed (not because he really cared about adults wearing seat belts, but because child restraints were part of the bill, and he and I were both tired of scraping 2 yr olds off the pavement whose parents were too ignorant to put them in a safety seat). The original bill required that everybody in the vehicle wear a safety belt, and that any infant or toddler under 80 lbs be strapped in an apporved child safety seat. The bill was later ammended (before it was passed) so that only the driver was required to wear a saftey belt because NO evidence could be found that suggested that anybody but the driver wearing a seatbelt had any bearing on survivalbilty or serious injury fro anybody but the singular individual who failed to wear the safety belt.\n\n \n Why should parents be held accountable for buckling up their children? Who's to tel them not to? According to your own argument  deaths are so rare  and it's actually rational not to use your seatbelts. Are we backpeddling? Under your possition, I wouldn't care about the children as much as I wouldn't care about the mothers, the fathers, the friends, the rest of the family.\n \n As well, if soeone in the rear seat is not harnessed in, basic physics tell sus that when someone makes a sudden fast jerk or movement, the body goes flying still in the same direction. The momentum carries them foreward and they can quite easily hit a driver, who, if he's also not wearing a seatbelt, can easily lose control of the car. Imagine what would happen if a 100 + Lbs comment rushes into the middle of your front seat. Will  YOU  be able to maintain control of your car? HIghly unlikely sir. People can barely control their cars when using cellphones and chewing gum at the same time. People are stupid.\n \n I say **** the children and let them all not wear their seatbelts. Then you and your father can continue to waste time, effort, money, and emotional investment to \"peel off\" the little children as well as the child's mother and father from the pavement.\n \n \n From a practical standpoint, there are much better measures that would serve better to serve this viewpoint, like the removal of the right to a jury, which is incredibly expansive in most cases and doesn't really serve much function.\n\n \n IMO, juries should be replaced by an objective board of technocratic law professionals. They would be organized into specific units instead of the \"peer\" system, which is largely idiotic. It's ludicrious they allow uneducated non-law professionals any say in a court of law. I don't even feel safe with half of the bias and ******** that goes on in court.\n \n \n A judge can do just as well. And from a utilitarian standpoint, why does the accused need a right to an attorney? It is a waste of man hours since the accused has to be there anyway, he should lodge his own defense.\n\n \n A person,in my perspective, doesn't have a real \"right\" to an attorney. WHen people commit crimes, yes, it would be more economic to just have them field their own defense, but that neither serves Rawlsian justice as fairness nor the utilitarian concept of beneficence nor the prima facie duty of non-maleficience. \n \n It's more utilitarian to have people with a \"right\" to an attorney to prevent arbitrary imprisonment as well as to create a healthy society. It creates positive utility if people are legally protected and recieve fair justice. If people all have equal access (at least on a basic level) to a law defense, they are happier than they are without it and it prevents people from being screwed. Justice is important, contrary to what many might believe about Utilitarianism. Utilitarians can accept Deontological frameworks if they, in actuallity, provide good utility.\n \n Imagine a word without lawers. Many more people would be wrongfully convicted, people wouldn't have enough money to defend themselves, and people would get mass-screwed by the government.\n \n People are also getting paid to be at court, and having lawers is good for society's economy. Yes, it costs the state and the person, but jobs are created. However, the most important thing to consider are:\n \n 1. principle of Sympathy\n 2. Utility created by protecting people with a right to a defense\n 3. The subset of utility (i believe) that are some elements of Rawlsian justice\n 4. Kanitian an Prima Facie Duties. (which I also are utilitarian in this scenario).\n \n \n Your tyoe of thinking on the seatbelt thing is dangerous because it is more than simply giving up a little bit of freedom for a whole lot of benifit, it is a change in mindset, which at the end of the day is all that any political system is based on. By your thoughts, we should be willing to give up some little rights for the common good. Once the people get used to doing this, the number and scale of rights to be surrendered for the common good go up. They always have and they always will. This is how nearly every tyrant in history has come to power.\n\n \n Yes. Exactly. I do think some rights have to be given up for the common good if it can be shown that it actually does protect lives (not just in the short term or temporary protection) and if it would minimize pain and suffering. I don't buy into the whole Patriot Act **** because it's a bunch of rhetoric and no real reasoning. \n \n I draw a line between giving up rights due to \"terror propaganda\" and fear mongering, and concrete statistics on lives saved. \n \n If they told me, however, that they would search my house in the \"chance\" that I may be involved in some criminal operation, I would be against the unlawful search and seizure. I would be against wiretapping phones (unless evidence is present).\n \n Evidence must always be presented to justify it and clearly show it's not made up propaganda.\n \n People need to be better educated and more objective to prevent this. People need to think rationally at the costs/benefit. Yes. It can be dangerous, but every human endeavor is wrought with dangers to provide for a greater good. That's the problem of the slippery slope, and even the HIstorical Precedent doesn't absolve people of that fallacy. People give up rights all the time. Taxation, for example. \n \n I have seen Randroids proclaim that taxation violates the right to property. People go to extremes to protect imaginary, ethically weak Rights. \n \n \n Look at gun control. Originally, American citizens enjoyed the right to own any weapon they felt compelled to own. you could buy hand grenades and machine guns through the mail. In fact, prior to the NFA, more machine guns were sold to civilians than to citizens. The right to keep an bear arms was seen as absolute. The NFA came to pass, despite the fat that even those who sponsered it considered it unconstitutional, but it managed to remain on the books primarily through failure to prosecute people who challenged in court as being unconstitutional (thus keeping it out of the supreme court). In a relatively shor time, we wnet from a nation where the people were unquestionably better armed than the governemtn to one where there are outright bans on guns in some parts of the country, and fairly draconian measures at the federal level that effect the whole nation.\n \n This is the result in a change in thoguht process over the years. The NFA was seen as a fairly slight infringement of rights. Then another fairly slight infringement took place, then another, until the RKBA in this nation as it was originally understood has almost completely vanished. At one time it was illegal in new york city for a police officer to ask a citizen if they owned a firearm. Now it is illegal in new york city to OWN most firearm, and registration witht he police is required. The slippery slope does certainly exist, and I can clearly demonstrate it in regards to every totalitarin government that ever exited on our planet.\n \n\n \n I am pro-gun, but I think everyone should have to pass a test showing they ar capable of uisng it correctly. Free, of course. Background checks are a must. Criminals ought not be given guns.\n \n However, from a Utilitarian perspective, most crimes aren't even commited by the guns which are trying to be banned. Many people actually feel safer and more happy WITH guns, and even cops agree that guns provide a catharthic benefit.\n \n Criminals inside prisons say they avoid victums who have guns visible.\n \n Even if you were to bann guns, people who commit crimes will get them from teh black market anyway.\n \n The arguments for the banning of weapons and gun control aren't sound from a utility-perspective. It's a lot of hoopla. \n \n \n You cannot get rid of weapons. People will kill people any other way they can even if they were banned.\n \n Seatbelts, on the other hand, aren't hoopla, and using them does work to great affect. If people don't use them, they most likely will die in any serious or medium accident.\n \n People who advocate what you are talking about go beyond reasonable Utility--they are fanatics and XXXXXX. They don't even have the facts or statistics half the time.\n \n \n Lets consider for a moment and do some real calculation. Assuming that 300,000,000 people travel daily in America, and enter and exit their vehicles 3 times per day. Assume that it takes an average of 30 secods per time that they enter and exit their vehicle to put on their seat belts\n\n \n Take me about 4 seconds once I get in the car, and that's cause I fool around a bit first.\n \n and you can hardly tally up everyone and count them evenly as wasting time. This is all quite a lot of heavy speculation at that. It doesn't take nearly that much time and effort. Most of this \"time\" in the car is wasted anyway. Putting on the seatbelt doesn't do much more.\n \n \n What you are essentially saying is that Fascism and soviet socialism failed as political systems because the right people werent in charge.\n\n \n Oh no. I am saying Communism doesn't work, and the communist attempt  in Russia didn't work and would never work for many more reasons. Communism as a system is highly immoral and doesn't work socially or economically. That's the problem. It's based on total historical, social, and economic fallacies and lies. It's a fantasy-dystopia.\n \n Fascism doesn't work, because propaganda and extreme nationalism are bad as well as complete government control over the lives if the people. *note: complete, even stupid **** that has no real social benefit.\n \n \n Both fascism and soviet socialism relied VERY heavily on utilitarinaism. Mussolini did everything he ever did for \"the people\". Everybody who dies under the reign of Stalin was the result of a utilitarinist decision. They died to protect \"the people\" and to provide happiness for \"the people\". Stalin was a true believer, as was Mussolini. These guyw were not megalomaniacs like hitler who were using a semi imaginary cause to consolidate personal power.\n\n \n Saying you are doing it for the people and actually doing something good for the people are two completely different concepts. Just like China calls itself the People's Democratic Republic, when it's far from it.\n \n There was no happiness in communism. People were in utter poverty, they were threatend with death and secret police, they were starved purpousfully, and they were killed off in millions by their own government...that's hardly utilitarian.\n \n Stalin was an assmonkey who tried to be utilitarian but failed to understand the goal of utiltiarianism. I don't know of any history which states that Stalin cared about his people. He didn't. He was paranoid an delusional half the time. He killed people to boost industrial capacity--millions. That's not care--that's not utility.\n \n \n Free societies will always have those who make the wrong choice, people who choose not to wear their seatbelt and end up flying through the windshield, people who choose to take a gun and shoot up a schoolyard full of children. These are the exception, not the rule. We tolerate such things because it is not worth the loss of rights that would be involved in abolishing them completely.\n\n \n Well. I don't agree in all circumstances. The costs are just too great to allow such nonsense to happen. People need to be saved from their own stupidty,e speically when it involves others who don't want to be a part of it.\n \n \n In a free society, the first, and really only, freedom is that to think for ones self, and to make decisions based on your own conclusions. I believe Orwell stated it best in 1984 \"Freedom is the freedom to say that 2+2=4\".\n\n \n Those who don't think collectively or deliberatly propagate lies, illogical sophistry, should not be allowed in society. You can think for yourself, but you cannot act on it if your case is shown to be chock full of irrational concepts like: i don't give a **** about my family or society! I will do whatever I want! Sure. I will cost my famlily tons of money as well as 20 billion to society. I will strike emotional harship on medical workers and my friends/family, but that's ok! I will keep insurance rates high, but that's ok! Becaue America gives people the \"right\" to be stupid.\n \n If that's the right they want, they don't deserve to exist. They are nothing more than walking Randroids. \n \n The market system doesn't work in ethics. Creationism is just one example. Sure...they have the freedom to say what they want. What's the result? The mass-spread of illogical sophistry and idiocy to such levels..that education and society suffers. nearly 50% of the American public is so STUPID and utterly incompetent, that they actually believe in creationism, many also belive in YEC. These are not people who should be given rational choicemaking opportunities. They have proven themselves infantile children who need a nanny to bitchslapthem into reality.\n \n They can present their case to peer review, then they shut the hell up and do what the state tells them if they're shot down.\n \n \n the leaders were honestly striving to do what they felt was best for the people as a whole. As far as \"rights violated\", under both systems, the majority of people did not feel tehir rights were being violated. Italians under Mussolini felt that they were some of the freeest people on the planet.\n\n \n If that be true, then I see no problem with the way they operated. Happiness is the goal, and if happiness were achieved (and people weren't killed or unnecessarily discriminated against), there is no problem. RIghts are subjective fabrications anyway. I doubt they were actually \"happy\" however, but I could be wrong.\n \n \n It was the pride in their eyes and voices as they showed me these ramshackle dumps that I would not let my dogs live in that caught my attention the most. After several minutes of conversation it became clear that in these guys minds, these were virtual palaces, luxury town homes. they knew that thre was no plumbing, and they knew that the walls were badly cracked (ins some cases so bad that they were stuffed with newspapaer to keep the weather on the outside). These things were no big deal in the minds of the people. They were unimportant. Neither the white house nor the presidential suite at the ritz would have seemed more luxurious to them.\n\n \n These people were happy? That's their subjective opinion. It's fine with me, as long as they're happy and hurting no one else.\n \n However, I wouldn't say the millions who died under Stalin and other soviet communists were happy. I wouldn't say that the people who tried to flee were happy. Maybe some, but not all. THe majority wasn't. The problem is...in soviet russian, the government tells you when to speak.\n \n When people spread ********, ******** corrupts the people. Theoretically, in the marketplace of ideas, these concepts are attacked and destroyed and go away--in reality NOPE! They stay, get stronger, and attract/convert people into walking zombies, just like PETA members who try to push their agenda on others leading to the development of a quasi-theocratic paradise.\n \n Some stuff's too stupid to let fly in the market. Everyone's entitled to an opinion, but that doesn't mean they are immune to Utilitarian calculation.",

   "Since most sources, both historical, dictionaries, (even italian dictionaries!) and encyclopedias agree that corporativism = corporatism, and Mussolini himself stated that he merged corporations and state, I have to agree. But, on the other hand, corporations don't automatically = businesses. I don't know what point of view you are taking on this. Mussolini did create subdivisions of 22 guilds, which are also called corporations. The government had control of these, but they were given token legislative power.\n \n I can't remember if it were you or someone else, but someone said that Mussolini ever gave power to corporations, which according to Wikipedia, they did. But I won't say any more on this, since I have never seen in any of my classes a division between vism and ism, except that vism is a different breed of ism.\n \n Hell, whenever I type corporativismo into my italian dictionary, I get corporatism/corporativism. I haven't really heard too much good about the Poli-sci curriculum, but I am sure it's just propaganda. I don't know. I haven't really had that high of an opinion of them as you probably don't about Historians. Inter-disciplinary rivalry :p \n\n \n i think it has more to do with histoians failing to clearly define where their \"turf\" ends. Most hsitorians are ill equipped to comment on ploiticalk systems. i cannot count the number of itmes I have heard well respected historians comment on roman senators being elected. They write entire papers about it. The down side to this is that it never happened. The roman senate was a plutocracy. You bought your seat on the senate, there was no election involved. I just don't think most historians get the training needed to completely understand the intricasies of some political systems. I mean, rome was a republic, and we are a republic, and WE have a senate where people are elected, so its all same same, right?\n \n \n \n \nNo. Not like those people at all. It's more only geared toward people who obviously cannot display enough intelligence to not engage in activities which harm others mentally/physically. They have no regard for others.\n\n \n Ok, so more like the kurds in Iraq, or those dastardly women in saudi arabia not long ago who casued irreperable mental harm to the school children by not only having their faces uncovered, but by actually hiking their skirts up until you could see leg to step over a body. Its a good thing those monsters were executed.\n \n \n \n It is estimated that seatbelts save approximately 10,000 lives per year. But it remains true that the majority of deaths and serious injuries from automobile accidents are a result of people not wearing seatbelts.\n\n \n WOW, then my number is WAY, WAY high. Besides, this is impossible to prove, or even to speculate about, since the VAST, VAST majority of deaths in vehicular crashes is the result of rollover, and survival rate in rollovers for folks wearing seatbelts and folks not wearing seatbelts is actually weighted in favor of those who are not.\n \n \n Americans pay billions of dollars each year in injury-related costs for people who don't wear seatbelts.\n\n \n First off, American insurance companies pay this, big difference. You are effectively arguing here removing rights in order to benifit corporations that are already clearing trillions in profit per year. Are you sure you are not a corporatist?\n \n \n \n Targeting messages toward adult seatbelt use. Children mirror adult behavior; when a driver is buckled, 94% of the time the children riding in that vehicle are buckled.\n \n Using your seatbelt, or being made to, creates and instills a higher level of virtue in younger children. They tend to mirrior the adult behavior, using seatbelts is good, intelligent behavior (that many wouldn't do if it weren't a law and propagandized).\n\n \n Personally I would rather teach my children that personal responsibility is good and rights are good. You wear your seat belt because you choose to, because it is a good decision. Not because some fascist is forcing you to.\n \n \n \nEngaging in behavior that deliberatly can lead to your death and harm others potentially, and behavior that badly reflects on your children is not intelligent. I found it most ironic that the college student tauting his freedoms and violations by the big bad gub'ment got his XXX killed. Not only did he destroy his own life, he had 0 consideration for his family and friends. He also became a cost to his parents, who now have to pay for his funeral unnecessarily.\n \n As I said earlier, XXXXXX like him are immoral, selfish objectivists who have no concern for anyone else but themselves.\n\n \n He played the odds, which were INCREDIBLY stacked in his favor, and lost. To be realistic, he was about as likely to win the power ball as to be killed in a carwreck, even if he wasn't wearing his seatbelt, so it was a logical gamble to take. \n \n Your other points above are entirely invalid. Everybody dies. There are only two certainties in this world. Politicians lie and everybody dies. When people die, somebody has to pay for the funeral. Whether it is paid for now or in another 50 years is inconsequential to the big picture. whether people mourn his passing now or in another 50 years is also inconsequential. There is no such thing as \"saving a life\". All we can do is possibly delay death. To aregue the \"mental anguish\" angle or the cost of burial is just stupid becuase those never change and never go away. Those are, for all intents and purposes, set values. \n \n \n \nDriving is not a right, but a privledge. YOu need a license to do it. If you want to use the roads the government builds, you obey the laws. If you don't want to, you don't need to drive on them. The federal government taxes the people to pay for roads. It's the government's responsibility to see that the roads operate efficiently and safely. If you are on public property administered by the government, you follow it's rules.\n\n \n WHOA. GOOD example of the slippery slope! Thank you!! For many years, traveling on the road, even by automobile, WAS CONSIDERED A RIGHT that all people enjoyed. They turned it from a right to a privelage and mandated drivers licenses, license plates, etc... in the name of safety, the \"greater good\". When the idea of drviers licenses was first advanced, it met with firm resistance. After all, Americans had the right to travel, and the right to drive was certainly part of that. A deal was made (as nearly always is). The safety in governemtn power folks got hteir drivers licenses, which ensured that people had a minimum amount of qualification to operate a vehicle and a minimum understanding of traffic laws. The concession was an understaid that the government did NOT have the power to revoke a drivers license or to refuse to issue one to a qualified applicant. 20 years later, after people had become accustomed to the concept of a driving permit, the laws quietly changed so the government DID have the power to revoke the license. And why not, after all, a permit was required, and permit implies permission, and certainly permission can be revoked. In less than thirty years the right to operate an automobile on public roads became a privelage. \n \n \n \nCertain rights cannot be taken away, because they tend to create a socially damaging negative utility. This is where I draw the line. I believe that the good of the many outweigh the good of the few, when the \"good\" involves concrete lives and costs. Other than that, I don't give a rats XXX what the people do in their own homes.\n\n \n What if they smoke? That kills a lot more people than car accidents. What if they choose to engage in unsafe sexual practices, thus helping to spread STD's which cost this nation FAR more than auto accidents. What if they drink heavily, which also leads to far more expenditure in medical bills than an auto accident. What if they overeat and become obese? In such case health problems, which you pointed out are very expensive to treat, are gauranteed, as opposed to their odds of dying due to not wearing a seatbelt, which is roughly 25,000 to 1.\n \n These are things that ciould be addressed and would absolutly save a LOT of lives, as opposed to a hypothetically saving a very few. I had an insurance physical last month. I am 15 lbs overweight. Should I get a ticket from the fat police? Where exactly do you draw the line in your quest to make the government everybodies mommy.\n \n \nYou have to separate totalitarian rights taken away from legitimate concerns. These speed and belt laws aren't malicious. It's obvious. You stop them when they become malicious.\n\n \n Maybe you cold name a single right EVER taken by a totalitarian government that was done maliciously. They never are. Rights are always taken for \"the greater good\". And the people love their leaders for it. They truly BELIEVE that these folks are looking out for them and acting in their best interests. We all know what a bastard Stalin was. Did you know that his funeral was so heavily attended that people were literally TRAMPLED TO DEATH trying to get there, so they could see their great leader one last time? Did you know that Stalins party took 40% o fthe vote int eh last election, and that polls showed that, had Stalin personally run, he would have won by a LANDSLIDE.\n \n This is because people BELIEVED. He was not a murdering , rights stealing monster. He was a hero of the russian people, who gladly surrendered any rights they may have enjoyed for the greater good. \n \n \n \nI beg to differ. The potential (and real) damage compared to the laughably minor infraction is not a rational risk to take. Many problems are caused by not-wearing seatbelts. That's why the laws are in place. The fact that one major case just occured is pure irony, and quite funny. \n \n The problem with this brand of Libertarian thinking is: OH, it will never happen to me and my family, or Oh, I won't be a burden, so \"screw that **** and **** da gub'ment.\" Then you die and ...it's...too late. What could possibly have saved me, my family, and my money...snap click! Perhaps I was too stupid to just...do it. \n \n People aren't smart in general. Polls prove that. Most of the american population is extremly stupid and socially backward. Maybe if people were smarter they could do more stuff for themselves. I am not saying YOU are stupid. I don't know what you do in your private life. I go by statistics.\n\n \n If that was the case, you wouldn't be supporting this idiocy. As you said, the numbers don't lie. The CDC is the only body that tracks these numbers nationwide. We just went through the calculations. I used a calculator, so I know they are right. Even using numbers that are as friendly to your casue as possible without lapsing into absolute fraud, it is obvious that this is a nothing deal.\n \n \n# Three of five people killed in vehicle accidents would have survived their injuries had they been wearing their seat belts. (Source: NHTSA)\n # Seat belts save an estimated 9,500 lives in the United States each year. (Source: NHTSA)\n # Every 12 seconds, someone is killed in a traffic accident. (Source: NHTSA) \n \n http://www.californiaautoinsurance.net/seatbelts.htm\n\n \n I will twell you a secret about these statistics. They are absolute garbage. They are based on standardised accident survey reports filled out by first responders. I have filled out hundreds of them. No matter what, if somebody is dead and tehy were not wearing a seatbelt, you check \"yes\" in the little box that asks if their life may have been saved. You do this becasue you WANT people to wear their seat belts. I once checked \"yes\" 3 times after a pickup truck was hit by a trail. There was barely enough of the people inside left to tell whether they were wearing their seatbelts or not. There is no chance that seatbelts would have done anything for those folks. \n \n The instructions on the sheet (which I believe is standardised form 1714) specifically state that if there is any doubt, you check yes. In reality, even if first responders DID try to be completely honest, and the instructions on the form were not heavily weighted towards fraud, it would be impossible to tell. I have seen corpses strapped into cars that were relatively undamaged. I also once saw a 15 yr old girl up walking around (and trying to bum a cigarette) who had been thrown through the windshiled and into a highway sign hard enough to fold it in half. And she was absolutly fine.\n \n Kansas is one of the last states to actually fill out that idiotic form. In most states the accident report is entered intot he computer and at the end of the month the computer spits out a report which is sent in liu of individual forms. In missouri, the computer checks \"yes\" for EVERY behicle related death where somebody wasn't wearing a seat belt. Pedestrian gets hit by a car....YES..he would have been saved if he was wearing a seat belt. \n \n Sorry, not going to impress me with this data. I KNOW where it comes from. I have been providing it for years. \n \n \nOver recent years, approximately one in every five motor vehicle occupants killed on our roads were unbelted, with a higher proportion of rear seated passengers killed in accidents unbelted, compared to drivers and front left passengers.\n \n http://www.tacsafety.com.au/jsp/content/NavigationController.do?areaID=12&tierID=1&navID=12348A44&navLink=null&pageID=168\n\n \n This is because of the proliferation of air bags. Note \"one in every five motor vehicle occupants killed on our roads were unbelted\". So, more people were killed while wearing seat belts than were killed while not wearing them. Sound like maybe we should ban them, not require them. \n \n \n \nMany unbelted vehicle occupants killed are intoxicated. Of the 35 drivers and passengers killed in 2003 who were not wearing a seat belt and whose BAC reading was known, 51% were intoxicated. \n \n Many people who don't wear their belts are usually intoxicated, according to statics. They are hardly rational people, but they are exercising their freedom----to be stupid.\n \n http://www.edgarsnyder.com/news/seatbelts/seat-belts-statistics.html\n\n \n First of all, this is absolutly meaningless because they don't tell you how many people had known blood alcohol levels. You can't even figure it out, since no combination of whole numbers between one and 35 gives you 51%.\n \n \n# In 2002, 42,850 people died in traffic accidents. Of that number, 19,103 were not wearing seat belts.\n # 4,200 lives could be saved each year if 90% of the U.S. population wore seat belts. \n \n Tell \"such few thousands of lives don't matter\" to their families, friends. It's immoral to condone such behavior.\n\n \n Earlier you said 10,000 lives would be saved. This simply shows the idiocy of trying to predict such things. Again, you will note that more people were killed who WERE wearing seat belts than were NOT wearing seat belts. \n \n I think that seatbelts save lives. You cannot prove it mathematically, though. Nobody has ever been able to. There is not even data available to do so, because we have NO IDEA how many people wear their seat belts overall. Generally the staistic used is \"1 in 4\" people don't wear their seatbelt. This is based on accident reports that cops are required to fill out (if people live, cops get to fill out the report. dead folks generally falls to the ambulance crew). After you get in a wreck, or even a minor fender bender, the cop will walk up to you holding his little ticket pad (since the reports are thoughtfully designed to fit in the ticket pad) and say something like \"I have to ask you, were you wearing your seatbelt?\" Since it is illegal in most places to not wear your seatbelt, and you are standing there talking to a cop who already has his ticket pad out, are you going to say \"no, officer, I wasn't\"? \n \n I just did my own little survey. I drove tot he gas station to get a soda and some milk. I saw 34 people on the way where I could tell if they were wearing seatbelts or not. 9 were. \n \n For sombody who is supposed to be basing their political views on logic and statistics, you are failing miserably here. You are advocating 75 MILLION man hours being wasted every day on a measure that can not be shown mathematically or statistically to have any effect at all. Your argument regarding emotional suffering an funerary expenses is so illogical that I don't even know where to begin.\n \n \nFatalities and accidents involving those not wearing seat belts costs the U.S. approximately $20 billion per year. Of that cost, 74% of the tab is paid for by the public. \n \n They are costing the public atrocious wastes of money. Again, very immoral due to their utter lack of regard and stupidity (characteristic of Randroid Objectivists).\n\n \n This is another statistic that means nothing at all without context. Fatalities and accidents involving those not wearing seatbelts? First, why would we include \"accidents\" since you are no more likely to have an accident while wearing a seat belt than while not wearing one. Second, the 74% is impossible. Lets look at what actually costs in an accident. The biggie is health care. According to the Census Bureau, in 2002, 84.8 percent of americans had insurance. We can theorise that, since there is no data showing that icome level has any effect on your likelyhood of having an accident, 84.8% of the medical bills were paid by insurance companies, or at least heavily subsidised by them. The second major expense is property damage/vehicle loss. These are either paid for by insurance, or by the parties involved in the wreck. so, what exactly is being paied for out of public money? The cost of the first responders time? They are either paid anyway (for sitting around waiting for something to happen) or are volunteers. Loss of use of the road for a few hours while the accident is cleaned up? you can't put a price tag on that.\n \n \n \nsometimes, even though people wear seatbelts, the death rate increases: why? alcohol and speeding are the two worst factors. Both of which, are..illegal. XXXXXX also not stopping at stopsigns and side impacting people is another concern. Pedestrians are also counted in deaths from accidents.\n The cost in lives, material, and money greatly oughtweight the right \"not to be told what to do.\" Especially since rights based ethics is fairly weak.\n\n \n Yet nothing here indicates a pressing need for legislation requiring seatbelts. \n \n And your final statement (about rights based ethics) is entirely wrong. Look at the great empires that have graced this planet. Every one of them was based on rights based ethics. The romans...roman citizens were considered to have rights that even the emporer himslef could not deprive them of. The british...it wasn't until after the concept of rights based ethics was made law that they became a world power. And, of course, there is the US, a system based entirely on rights based ethics. Do you really find it a coincidence that the three great empires in our history were all based on these rigths that you so easily dismiss? do you really think it is another coincidence that in all 3 cases the empires in question began to decline when they moved away from a system of rights based ethics?\n \n \n \nNot wearing your seat belt, if you are the driver poses many problems. Foremost, the seatbelt keeps you harnessed into your seat and prevents movement, which in turn makes you more capable, especially under fast or dangerous conditions, to handle your vehicle. If you get into an accident or try to avoid one, you can easily tip, flip your vehicle depending on what type it is, or you can swerve, throwing people around in your car injuring them.\n\n \n Certainly your seatbelt keeps you harnessed to your seat (that is pretty much the point. When you are driving fast, do you have a problem with levitating out of your seat? Have you ever actually swerved hard enough to be thrown out of your seat? I have done some pretty crazy driving, and I have never swerved hard enough to be thrown out of my seat. I have even been going down the road, without a seat belt, jerked the emergency brake, and thrown a 360, and that was not enough to knock me out of the seat. Not even close. Maybe if your seat was made of glass as opposed to a form fitting, cushony substance. I don't think that there is any swerve more severe than throwing a 360. Also, how is the driver wearing his set belt going to keep other poeple from being thrown about the car (you must have some VERY light friends to be worried about this). Since in all practicality, the drivers butt is not going to leave the seat no matter how hard they swerve, which means that only the drivers upper body is likely to be effected at all, and it will certainly be pushed sideways (for which a seatbelt provides no protection at all), how is this relevant?\n \n \nIt's is also quite well documented that people have been totally ejected from their cars and sent hurtingly at 40 MPH out onto Federal Property. It's quite easy to hit someone or something else if anyone is unlucky enough to be anywhere near.\n\n \n and yet it has NEVER happened. People have been waiting for this for YEARS. Somebody being ejected from the vehicle and killing somebody else. It simply isn't reality. It is a farce. \n \n \n \nWhy should parents be held accountable for buckling up their children? Who's to tel them not to? According to your own argument  deaths are so rare  and it's actually rational not to use your seatbelts. Are we backpeddling? Under your possition, I wouldn't care about the children as much as I wouldn't care about the mothers, the fathers, the friends, the rest of the family.\n\n \n Have you ever held a dead child? Have you ever loaded a dead child into a body bag? If you ever do, you will understand. My position in that regard is completely irrational and I andmit it freely. Beyond that, it is entirely selfish. I have seen a LOT of combat, and I have seen a LOT of broken and mangled bodies from either accidents or intentional acts. I have seen kids burned to death, I have seen them killed by mortars, grenades, bombs, I have seen them as bloody messes after car wrecks. The other day I ran a call and put a beautiful 2 yr old girl in a body bag because her mother beat her to death. She had a 4 yr old sister who watched the whole thing. She said \"Momma put us in our room and told us to be quite because she had a fight with her boyfiriend. she (the little sister) kept crying so mom kept coming in and hitting her on the head. She did this a lot and then she didn't cry any more but she didn't move either.\"\n \n On a good night, I will sleep for 3 hours before I wake up screaming and in a cold sweat. I have not slept since I ran that call, and I will not sleep until I am so exhausted that no amount of ephederine and caffeine can keep me awake. When I finally reach that point, I will toss back 2500 MG of oxycodone and a triple stoli neat, which will put me in a comatose state for abotu 20 hours. I have this down to a fine art by now. \n \n Over the course of the next week or two, I will be able to sleep an hour, then two, then three, but never more than four (I haven't slept more than four hours without the aid of some pretty serious narcotics for years). That is my life, and that is why I hold my view about child safety seats. It is absolutly contradictory to most of my political ideals, but every time I close my eyes there are dead children waiting there, children who almost always died horrible, painful deaths. Dead children are different from dead adults. Until you have held one, you cannot possibly understand how huge that difference is, and I hope to god that you never do because it will haunt you for the rest of your life.\n \n That is actually why I am posting huge, multi page posts here. It helps keep my mind off of unpleasantness, and when it is that fresh in my mind, if I start thinking about it, I cannot stop, and eventually I will go hide in my office and cry, adn once I start, I cannot stop. I am way too loopy to go in to work (several days without sleep will do that to even the most hardened insomniac) so you are getting the brunt of my nervous energy, and the benifit of seeing me ramble on like a lunatic. Unfortunatly, soldiers and paramedics do not get the benifit of clinical detachment that doctors get. They are out there in the ****, and it is all over them, and there is nothing clinical about it.\n \n \nAs well, if soeone in the rear seat is not harnessed in, basic physics tell sus that when someone makes a sudden fast jerk or movement, the body goes flying still in the same direction. The momentum carries them foreward and they can quite easily hit a driver, who, if he's also not wearing a seatbelt, can easily lose control of the car. Imagine what would happen if a 100 + Lbs comment rushes into the middle of your front seat. Will  YOU  be able to maintain control of your car? HIghly unlikely sir. People can barely control their cars when using cellphones and chewing gum at the same time. People are stupid.\n\n \n But basic physics also tells us they will continue in the same diresction in shich they were traveling, shich means they will hit the back of the seat, not the driver, who also (basic physics tells us) will have continued in the same direction, and thus be saved from ebing struck by the passenger. \n \n By the time that 100 lb passenger hits the back of the seat hard engouhg for ti to matter, the wreck has already occured. Besides, 100 lbs traveling at 70 mph is nothing when it impacts the rigid, padded back of a seat.\n \n \nI say **** the children and let them all not wear their seatbelts. Then you and your father can continue to waste time, effort, money, and emotional investment to \"peel off\" the little children as well as the child's mother and father from the pavement.\n\n \n Like I said, my views on this are almost entirely selfish. Besides, in car wreck, there is less than a 2 percent chance that an adult will be killed regardless of seatbelt status. With children and infants, it is an entirely differnt story. A child in a car seat will be killed less than .014% of the time in a wreck. The car seat provides so much extra protection that something REALLY severe has to happen to kill that infant. The stadards for infant seats literally allow for survival if you dropped that kid out a 3rd story window. On the other hand, there is an 80% chance of serious injury or death if the child/infant is not in a seat. Children and infants are weak. They cannot survive things that adults do. Their skelatal system is simply not strong enough. Even a weak person can literally crush an infants head with their bare hands You would have to be monsterously strong to do the same to an adult.\n \n \n \nIMO, juries should be replaced by an objective board of technocratic law professionals. They would be organized into specific units instead of the \"peer\" system, which is largely idiotic. It's ludicrious they allow uneducated non-law professionals any say in a court of law. I don't even feel safe with half of the bias and ******** that goes on in court.\n\n \n Teh jury system is one of citizen justice that has proven itself time and again. It is one of the checks in our system of checks and balances and a safegaurd aganst tyranny. It gives people the ability to choose what kind of nation they wish to live in. \n \n \n \nA person,in my perspective, doesn't have a real \"right\" to an attorney. WHen people commit crimes, yes, it would be more economic to just have them field their own defense, but that neither serves Rawlsian justice as fairness nor the utilitarian concept of beneficence nor the prima facie duty of non-maleficience. \n \n It's more utilitarian to have people with a \"right\" to an attorney to prevent arbitrary imprisonment as well as to create a healthy society. It creates positive utility if people are legally protected and recieve fair justice. If people all have equal access (at least on a basic level) to a law defense, they are happier than they are without it and it prevents people from being screwed. Justice is important, contrary to what many might believe about Utilitarianism. Utilitarians can accept Deontological frameworks if they, in actuallity, provide good utility.\n\n \n But if you do away with juries as you suggested above, no matter how good your lawyer is, you have no protection against getting screwed. Without being tried by a jury of your peers, there are no gaurantees of justice. People in Nazi germany had a right to an attorney, it didn't do them a whole lot of good.\n \n \nImagine a word without lawers. Many more people would be wrongfully convicted, people wouldn't have enough money to defend themselves, and people would get mass-screwed by the government.\n \n People are also getting paid to be at court, and having lawers is good for society's economy. Yes, it costs the state and the person, but jobs are created. However, the most important thing to consider are:\n \n 1. principle of Sympathy\n 2. Utility created by protecting people with a right to a defense\n 3. The subset of utility (i believe) that are some elements of Rawlsian justice\n 4. Kanitian an Prima Facie Duties. (which I also are utilitarian in this scenario).\n\n \n Money spent on such services has absolutly no positive net balance for your economy. That is the problem with a service based economy (and why ournation has virtually bankrupted itself and has resorted to fighting wars and multi trillion dollar social programs to keep our GDP up). You are either creating tangible value, which brings wealth into the country, or you are not. All service based economies do is shuffle money around. You could just give your lawyer the same amount of money for no services rendered and it would have the same effect on the economy, which is zero.\n \n \n \n \nYes. Exactly. I do think some rights have to be given up for the common good if it can be shown that it actually does protect lives (not just in the short term or temporary protection) and if it would minimize pain and suffering. I don't buy into the whole Patriot Act **** because it's a bunch of rhetoric and no real reasoning. \n \n I draw a line between giving up rights due to \"terror propaganda\" and fear mongering, and concrete statistics on lives saved. \n \n \n Even when the \"lives saved\" are such a small overall number as to be negligeble? Even at that, they are purely theoretical. Those supportive of the \"war on terror\" are using the same argument as you, and thiers is no more theoretical than your.\n \n \nPeople need to be better educated and more objective to prevent this. People need to think rationally at the costs/benefit. Yes. It can be dangerous, but every human endeavor is wrought with dangers to provide for a greater good. That's the problem of the slippery slope, and even the HIstorical Precedent doesn't absolve people of that fallacy. People give up rights all the time. Taxation, for example. \n \n \n NOW we are getting somewhere. People need to be better educated, but I think the primary education they need is what is important and what is not. People get so hung up on pathetic little htings, things like shool shootings and gun deaths, traffic fatalities, drunk driving....things that are so statistically anomolous that they really make no difference at all. Fools dedicate theri LIVES to these things. Then when something actually important comes along, we are so busy squabbling about these statistical anomolies that we miss it completely. We trust our politicians and our media, which is controlled entirely by corporate interests in the form of advertising revenues, to tell us what is important and what is not. \n \n The recent intelligence reform bill is a good example. We have now created an agency that for all intents and purposes is a secret police force which is accountable to nobody but themselves. In order to ensure that our rights are not trampled on, this bunch has an officer specifically responsible for ensuring that they are not. This guy is appointed by the national intelligence director, and reports only tothe national intelligence director, who is the head of this circle jerk. That means that the guy responsible for safegaurding our civil rights reports back to the guy who theoretuically would have had to give the order to violate those rights. And we have XXXXXX like Sarah Brady who have dedicated theri lives to trying to lower the percentage of our total population that is shot each year. Currently that percentage satnds at .007%. A number so low that you could rightly argue that NOBODY is shot in America each year since numbers that low are routinely zeroed out by staticians in order to clean up results. -\n \n \n \nI am pro-gun, but I think everyone should have to pass a test showing they ar capable of uisng it correctly. Free, of course. Background checks are a must. Criminals ought not be given guns.\n \n However, from a Utilitarian perspective, most crimes aren't even commited by the guns which are trying to be banned. Many people actually feel safer and more happy WITH guns, and even cops agree that guns provide a catharthic benefit.\n \n Criminals inside prisons say they avoid victums who have guns visible.\n \n Even if you were to bann guns, people who commit crimes will get them from teh black market anyway.\n \n The arguments for the banning of weapons and gun control aren't sound from a utility-perspective. It's a lot of hoopla. \n \n \n You cannot get rid of weapons. People will kill people any other way they can even if they were banned.\n\n \n Correct, it is all a binch of hooplah, just like seat belts. BUT, we will sit here and argue abotu it like XXXXXX basically because we are told that it is somehow important despite the fact that from a statistical standpoint, deaths from car wrecks and deaths from guns simply don't happen.\n \n \nSeatbelts, on the other hand, aren't hoopla, and using them does work to great affect. If people don't use them, they most likely will die in any serious or medium accident.\n\n \n This si the problem. NO, you won't, unless you define serious or medium accident as one where sombody dies (in which case you are stacking the numbers). In reality, most serious or moderate accidents do not result in a fatality. It takes a major, traumatic incident to kill a person. It is simply not that easy to do.\n \n \n \nTake me about 4 seconds once I get in the car, and that's cause I fool around a bit first.\n \n and you can hardly tally up everyone and count them evenly as wasting time. This is all quite a lot of heavy speculation at that. It doesn't take nearly that much time and effort. Most of this \"time\" in the car is wasted anyway. Putting on the seatbelt doesn't do much more.\n\n \n It takes me nearly a full minute to buckle in my two children. If you just average us, you 8 seconds a trip, me 2 minutes, 6 seconds per trip, the numbers are obviously heavily weighted in your favor. \n \n Itme in the car is not wasted. It is transport time. You should be moving, that is an industrious activity.\n \n \n \nOh no. I am saying Communism doesn't work, and the communist attempt  in Russia didn't work and would never work for many more reasons. Communism as a system is highly immoral and doesn't work socially or economically. That's the problem. It's based on total historical, social, and economic fallacies and lies. It's a fantasy-dystopia.\n \n Fascism doesn't work, because propaganda and extreme nationalism are bad as well as complete government control over the lives if the people. *note: complete, even stupid **** that has no real social benefit.\n\n \n BUTm they are both entierly utilitarian. From a practical standpoint, taking absolute control of a nation, and ensuring that EVERYBODY is working together in for the good of the nation, ensuring there is not corporate squabbling and no energy wasted on one uppsmanship SHOULD yield a highly productive society. It just didn't work out this way.\n \n \nSaying you are doing it for the people and actually doing something good for the people are two completely different concepts. Just like China calls itself the People's Democratic Republic, when it's far from it.\n \n There was no happiness in communism. People were in utter poverty, they were threatend with death and secret police, they were starved purpousfully, and they were killed off in millions by their own government...that's hardly utilitarian.\n \n Stalin was an assmonkey who tried to be utilitarian but failed to understand the goal of utiltiarianism. I don't know of any history which states that Stalin cared about his people. He didn't. He was paranoid an delusional half the time. He killed people to boost industrial capacity--millions. That's not care--that's not utility.\n\n \n Assmonkey....I like that. You are missing the point. These folks all BELIEVED they were acting in the best interest of the people. It is never until later, usually MUCH later, that it is realised that what they believed was in the best interest of the people was not really so. These guys were true believers. Stalin was the absolute leader of russian and in private he lived like a pauper. He was possibly the only person in the entire governemtn who was not corrupt. He took no bribes and allowed himself no personal privelage. \n \n Nobody has ever endeavored to run a utilitarianistic system and halfway intot he project realised that they were really turning things into a massive cluster **** and reversed course. Nobody has veer started removing rights form their people then realised halfway through thay they were turning into a tyranical XXXXXXXX and backed off. It is almost always years later that everybody steps back and goes \"WPW. that was a bad idea\". In light of that, I think we should just stay away from such setups all togetehr. We have never seen a case where it has suceded, it has ALWAYS failed. No matter how many times you hit yourself int he head with a hammer, it is always going to hurt, and always going to leave a bruise. \n \n \n \n \nThose who don't think collectively or deliberatly propagate lies, illogical sophistry, should not be allowed in society. You can think for yourself, but you cannot act on it if your case is shown to be chock full of irrational concepts like: i don't give a **** about my family or society! I will do whatever I want! Sure. I will cost my famlily tons of money as well as 20 billion to society. I will strike emotional harship on medical workers and my friends/family, but that's ok! I will keep insurance rates high, but that's ok! Becaue America gives people the \"right\" to be stupid.\n\n \n Stalin had an excellent solution for this. Those who failed to think collectively or deliberatly propogate lies that were in contrast tot eh obvious truths of socialism were simply killed. Simple, effective, quick. Orwell called it \"thought crime\".\n \n \nIf that's the right they want, they don't deserve to exist. They are nothing more than walking Randroids. \n \n They can present their case to peer review, then they shut the hell up and do what the state tells them if they're shot down.\n\n \n You are really going to have to expalin to me how this was any different at all from stalins rational in killing all those million of folks. I honestly cannot even see s aslight enough difference to address it.\n \n \n \nIf that be true, then I see no problem with the way they operated. Happiness is the goal, and if happiness were achieved (and people weren't killed or unnecessarily discriminated against), there is no problem. RIghts are subjective fabrications anyway. I doubt they were actually \"happy\" however, but I could be wrong.\n\n \n OH, yes they were. Most people in soviet russia thought the system was great. Those who didn't were killed or tossed in the gulag.....where they were eventually killed.",

   " Ok, so more like the kurds in Iraq, or those dastardly women in saudi arabia not long ago who casued irreperable mental harm to the school children by not only having their faces uncovered, but by actually hiking their skirts up until you could see leg to step over a body. Its a good thing those monsters were executed.\n\n \n Not everything does equal mental harm or even realistc harm. THe mental harms that come from being: discriminated, Beaten, seeing family members commit suicide, having friends/relatives killed  are  mentally damaging as well as real emotional kickers.\n \n There is evidence that great loss causes trauma and problems.\n \n For example, some people like to say that having homosexual parents makes kids unstable mentally--but it doesn't according to the american anthropolgical association, the American Psychiatric association, as well as the AMerican Anthropological Association. \n \n It really depends on what is tested. Not wearing a facemask due to relgious indoctrination does no real lasting harm. Watching the medics peel people off the street--when it's your family, does. Losing important family members to something that could have been easily stopped, does.\n \n It's also been shown through studies that even watching violence on tv, nudity does not lead to mental or emotional damage. It also does no physical damage.\n \n \n \n WOW, then my number is WAY, WAY high. Besides, this is impossible to prove, or even to speculate about, since the VAST, VAST majority of deaths in vehicular crashes is the result of rollover, and survival rate in rollovers for folks wearing seatbelts and folks not wearing seatbelts is actually weighted in favor of those who are not.\n\n \n It's not impossible to prove. Most sources corroborate or give estimates in that ballpark. And even if your's is high...10k needless deaths aren't something to sneeze at. Even in rollovers, with airbags, the chances of limiting deaths with seatbelts is immense. Nearly all studies show this.\n \n Where is the study that shows that rollovers are safer without harneses? I would like to read this and see what source it comes from. It hardly seems true, since you are thrown around like a rag doll in rollovers and can easily be crushed.\n \n \n First off, American insurance companies pay this, big difference. You are effectively arguing here removing rights in order to benifit corporations that are already clearing trillions in profit per year. Are you sure you are not a corporatist?\n\n \n Billons spent needlessly. I don't want insurnace companies to waste money on people who were irresponsible. It's a needless waste on corporations. If you want me to call a corporatist for wanting not only to save lives but prevent wasted insurance cash--yes. I am a corporatist.\n \n People pay into their insurnace compaines. When **** like this happens, insurance compaines raise rates, which I also think is unnecessary and preventable.\n \n The money can be better spent elsewhere.\n \n \n Personally I would rather teach my children that personal responsibility is good and rights are good. You wear your seat belt because you choose to, because it is a good decision. Not because some fascist is forcing you to.\n\n \n The Fascist knows better, because children don't usually listen to their parents when they see the parent isn't doing what they preach--in fact, if the parent does the opposite, who the hell cares what the hypocrit says? That's the mentality of a child. I know you would personally rather do it, but some people would personally drink themselves into oblivion or spend all their money on booze, ruining their families savings. That's wrong too.\n \n If it's a good decision and you ought to do it, then you should, and the government should see to it that you do. Most people without coercion will be irresponsible and immoral, unless they have been thoroughly educated in Ethics. But that already is very limited, but that's another thing that should be mandatory in Education by Federal Standards.\n \n \n He played the odds, which were INCREDIBLY stacked in his favor, and lost. To be realistic, he was about as likely to win the power ball as to be killed in a carwreck, even if he wasn't wearing his seatbelt, so it was a logical gamble to take.\n\n \n That's what 10 thousand people a year say, and it..still happens. Multiply that number by the friends and family and the net of pain increases.\n \n \n \n Your other points above are entirely invalid. Everybody dies. There are only two certainties in this world. Politicians lie and everybody dies. When people die, somebody has to pay for the funeral. Whether it is paid for now or in another 50 years is inconsequential to the big picture. whether people mourn his passing now or in another 50 years is also inconsequential. There is no such thing as \"saving a life\". All we can do is possibly delay death. To aregue the \"mental anguish\" angle or the cost of burial is just stupid becuase those never change and never go away. Those are, for all intents and purposes, set values.\n \n\n \n You are right about the funeral costs, yes. I concede that. But that's not my main focus, although I do want to eliminate the needless expenditure on funerals as long as possible, especiallyin cases where the family cannot afford it early. Everyone does die, but it doesn't mean you have to let the suffering and pain continue becaue of that. It's not Utilitarian and it's not ethical. According to your logic, since everyone dies eventually, we might as well not heal them either. Healing is merely postponing the inevitible. Ignoring it isn't the point of Ethics. A lot of pain and suffering could be ignored, but it ought not.\n \n You are committing the is/ought fallacy. Just because that's what IS the case does not equate to what ought to be. People should prevent the most ammount of pain and suffereing and maximize preference satisfaction as ong as posisble untill they no longer can live. People should not be responsible for paying funderal costs at an unnecessary time or seing their loved ones die unnecessarily. Thinking otherwise is oftly nihilistic.\n \n The pain and suffering does factor in. That's the bases behind many Ethical Thoeries. According to your logic, we might as well not engage in relieve of pain or try to save lives, because they will die anyway. You aren't saving their lives. What kind of statement is that from a medic?\n \n Eventually you have to pay, perhaps when you are more stable and older and you have gotten more joy and fufillment out of life. It's too much to ask for to force that on your relatives and friends if you could prevent it.\n \n Life expectancies go up, and the longer you live, the more preferences can be maximixed and greater happiness can be achieved. Your basically saying \"we die, oh well, there's no point.\" That's Nihilism.\n \n What form of Ethics do you base this conclusion off of?\n \n \n \n WHOA. GOOD example of the slippery slope! Thank you!! For many years, traveling on the road, even by automobile, WAS CONSIDERED A RIGHT that all people enjoyed.\n\n \n Considered is the key word. What people consider isn't necessarily the truth. That delves into conventional relativism.\n \n \n hey turned it from a right to a privelage and mandated drivers licenses, license plates, etc... in the name of safety, the \"greater good\"\n\n \n Righly so. People need to be more qualified to drive for public welfare. License plates are also useful. \n \n \n When the idea of drviers licenses was first advanced, it met with firm resistance. After all, Americans had the right to travel, and the right to drive was certainly part of that.\n\n \n The right to travel doesn't logically imply the right to drive, especially on Federal Property. It's the state that's supreme in this arena. As I mentioned earlier, one of the problems with any Rights-Based ethical theory is that it has no real independent backing and the rights held don't impy that you must honour them. Having and honouring are different.\n \n The problem is that people never had a right to drive in the first place; they thought they did, when in reality the State is benevolent enough to allow them to do so and to honour their right of travel by letting them have access to state and Federal property because doing so is Utilitarian overall. The roads are the responsibility of the State. To safely use them, you ought to follow the laws, thus preventing unnecessary harm to others and violations of other's Rights. Laws are necessarily restrictions on a small ammount of freedom in order to provide for efficiency and safety. As long as the net balance is minor damage, it's ok.\n \n Speed limits are another example. They are a blend of Utilitarian design for the benefit of corporations (convenience and money) travel convenience, and life-saving principles. We could always get rid of them, but then lives will unnecessarily be lost and more costs would ensure.\n \n \n What if they smoke? That kills a lot more people than car accidents. \n\n \n You are correct. Smoking  is  highly immoral from many ethical perspectives, not just Utilitarianism--my favourite.\n \n However, ethics must also be balanced with Human nature and practicality. You cannot do anything about people smoking entirely. They will do it anyway, it will create crime if made illegal (on a huge-assed scale), and it's totally 100% unenforceable.\n \n It's still wrong, however. \n \n \n What if they choose to engage in unsafe sexual practices, thus helping to spread STD's which cost this nation FAR more than auto accidents.\n\n \n Also unenforcable. People ought to use protection and if the situation become serious enough..well...If they willingly go out and infect people on purpose,they should be charged with crimes and dealt with.\n \n \n What if they drink heavily, which also leads to far more expenditure in medical bills than an auto accident.\n\n \n Alcoholism is bad. But it's unenforcable, so it's impossible to deal with. The best you can do is educate them and bombard them with information. This was tried already during Prohibition--it failed miserably. Not that the idea wasn't right, however. Crime will occure, MORE people wil die, and the situation will get worse. It's a necessary evil.\n \n \n What if they overeat and become obese?\n\n \n This is highly unlikely. The main problem people are fat is becaues of Corporations, which should be dealt with instead of the individual people. American food in particular is a tool used by COrporations to enslave the people--it has the nasty side-effect of making people morbidly obese in general.\n \n Again, you cannot stop being from eating. It's impossible. You can pull them over, however, and make them put on their seatbelt. You also cannot do everything. There's no way to monitor everything.\n \n If something could be done while minimzing unhappiness, I would be for it, but most of those increase overall damage and unhappiness and expense if it were attempted to control them.\n \n \n These are things that ciould be addressed and would absolutly save a LOT of lives, as opposed to a hypothetically saving a very few. I had an insurance physical last month. I am 15 lbs overweight. Should I get a ticket from the fat police? Where exactly do you draw the line in your quest to make the government everybodies mommy.\n\n \n Ya know. THat's a good idea. :phone: 1-800-Phat. You have to look at what is logically possible and the cheapest to enforce and what actually provides the most happiness. Most people actually want seatbelts and the lives saved and relations are immense. It's not only the pain of the family it's the chance they will injur others directly or indirectly in actions taken. That's a major hypothetical consideration by most Ethicists.\n \n \n \n This is because people BELIEVED. He was not a murdering , rights stealing monster. He was a hero of the russian people, who gladly surrendered any rights they may have enjoyed for the greater good.\n\n \n Then they have absolutly nothing to complain about, but I hear equally as bad stories from Russia bout the commie-wannabees. It was hardly the paradise you make it out to be, even to the russian people. Take Ayn Rand, for example. SHe wasn't thrilled to be there.\n \n \n \n If that was the case, you wouldn't be supporting this idiocy. As you said, the numbers don't lie. The CDC is the only body that tracks these numbers nationwide. We just went through the calculations. I used a calculator, so I know they are right. Even using numbers that are as friendly to your casue as possible without lapsing into absolute fraud, it is obvious that this is a nothing deal.\n \n\n \n [quote]\n From the moral perspective, I see it differently. It's well-worth it. Sacrificing minimal ammounts of imaginary rights for the greater good...yea. It's worth it. You may not think 10 thousand individual lives and their networks are worth it, but most ethicists do. [quote] \n \n \n\n I will twell you a secret about these statistics. They are absolute garbage.\n\n \n Untill then, it's just a statement, and I trust the studies over your opinion. Personal anecdotes are not proof, since they aren't verifiable or falsifiable. I could say I am uncle bob and work for the national road service and i see 14 accidents a day, no one wearing seatbelts. It's equally useless.\n \n \n \n Earlier you said 10,000 lives would be saved. This simply shows the idiocy of trying to predict such things. Again, you will note that more people were killed who WERE wearing seat belts than were NOT wearing seat belts.\n \n\n \n There are other factors that permit this. Wearing it incorrectly, inappropriatly,. Damaged belts.\n \n Again, different studies range from 9-19k It's not 100%, but no knowledge is. Asking for 100% is mere sophistry.\n \n Air bags with seatbelts makes a much larger benefit. Using belts does save lives. NOt every life. NO one said that. You seem to expect that of technology.\n \n I will believe you when you prove that assertion from a credible source.\n \n \n I think that seatbelts save lives. You cannot prove it mathematically, though. Nobody has ever been able to.\n\n \n Statistics and independant agencies say otherwise. They are tab bit more credible than you are I'm afraid.\n \n \n For sombody who is supposed to be basing their political views on logic and statistics, you are failing miserably here. You are advocating 75 MILLION man hours being wasted every day on a measure that can not be shown mathematically or statistically to have any effect at all. Your argument regarding emotional suffering an funerary expenses is so illogical that I don't even know where to begin.\n\n \n No, im not. You are the one denying both mainstream and statistical evidence and using anecdotal responses as evidence. That's illogical and unreasonable.\n \n \n Your argument regarding emotional suffering an funerary expenses is so illogical that I don't even know where to begin.\n\n \n It's not illogical lol. Nihilism is, however. It's ethical, what I am saying. Your dismissal of it nothwithstanding. Your 75 million manhours is also laughable. It takes about 4 seconds to put on a seatbelt and you are trying to multiply 30 seconds times a huge number of people =D people, individually, aren't spending much time at all, and they are in the car anyway doing nothing.\n \n It's not even a factor.\n \n \n since you are no more likely to have an accident while wearing a seat belt than while not wearing one.\n\n \n Actually, that's not true. You are more secure in your seat and in better control of your car when you are strapped in. This is one reason why racers use belts and harnesses. Your chances of being shifted or thrown around decrease with the useage of belts.\n \n \n This is another statistic that means nothing at all without context. Fatalities and accidents involving those not wearing seatbelts? First, why would we include \"accidents\" since you are no more likely to have an accident while wearing a seat belt than while not wearing one. Second, the 74% is impossible. Lets look at what actually costs in an accident. The biggie is health care. According to the Census Bureau, in 2002, 84.8 percent of americans had insurance. We can theorise that, since there is no data showing that icome level has any effect on your likelyhood of having an accident, 84.8% of the medical bills were paid by insurance companies, or at least heavily subsidised by them. The second major expense is property damage/vehicle loss. These are either paid for by insurance, or by the parties involved in the wreck. so, what exactly is being paied for out of public money? The cost of the first responders time? They are either paid anyway (for sitting around waiting for something to happen) or are volunteers. Loss of use of the road for a few hours while the accident is cleaned up? you can't put a price tag on that.\n\n \n Statistics and sources say otherwise. I provided credible studies from government and independent agencies. The burden of proof is on you to prove otherwise, not by using anecdotal information.\n \n Insurance companies shouldn't have to pay for needless accidents.\n \n \n Only a Republican would cheer $200 billion spent to take revenge for 9/11's 3000 deaths, and sneer at $100 million spent on public awareness to save twice that many lives every year.\n\n ---MIke Wong. It's silly. \n \n And youc an factor in Road Usage time. Utilitarians do it all the time.\n \n \n ausalities from the war still a bit lower than that? If we should get upset over the men who died fighting in the Middle East and act to prevent more deaths, then we most assurely get upset over this and act to prevent unnecessary death at home.\n \n And we should also consider all of the people not counted in this statistic, ie- all of the horrible injuries. Car crashes routinely produce horrifying injuries, many of which could have been mitigated if the occupant wasn't launched from the vehicle like a meat missile.\n\n \n ---Wong.\n \n \n For some reason, people don't understand the implications of not wearing seatbelts lol.\n \n As some other ethical colleagues explicate: \n \n It's not quite that clearly-cut. If someone had t-boned [a car] and killed Derek [ derek is one such idiot who doesn't wear a elt] in such a way that could have been avoided had he worn his seat belt, that person could be charged with manslaughter. Seat belt laws aren't just there to be oppressive Leftist policy; they're there to minimize the potential damage to all parties in case of an accident.\n \n Same deal with motorcycle helmets. If some yahoo on a motorcycle gets hit by a car and cracks his skull open, the other driver gets hit with manslaughter charges because the XXXXX on the bike wasn't wearing a helmet.\n\n \n \n \n \n Yet nothing here indicates a pressing need for legislation requiring seatbelts.\n\n \n The death and emotional trauma is enough. You don't even have to factor in the unnesessary road time and expenditures. It's more than enough ethically.\n \n \n\n And your final statement (about rights based ethics) is entirely wrong. \n\n \n **** on a happy-stick. It's far from wrong.\n \n \n\n Look at the great empires that have graced this planet. Every one of them was based on rights based ethics. \n\n \n As if the numbers who use it make it right. That's ethically invalid right there as a support.\n \n \n\n The romans...roman citizens were considered to have rights that even the emporer himslef could not deprive them of. \n\n \n Good for him! Doesn't make it real or Rights ethics credible. In fact, it's not according to most credible ethicists!\n \n \n\n The british...it wasn't until after the concept of rights based ethics was made law that they became a world power. \n\n \n False cause fallacy and post hoc, ergo propter hoc. Prove Rights is what made them powerful. Soviet Russia was a massive world power, and it had many rights violations, as did Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. All very power. your conclusion doesn't follow from the premises.\n \n \n\n And, of course, there is the US, a system based entirely on rights based ethics. \n\n \n Incorrect. Rights based system is part OF the US government, not it in it's entirety. It's also based on deontological duty as well as Utilitarianism. Rights are actually Utilitarian and Deontological.\n \n \n\n Do you really find it a coincidence that the three great empires in our history were all based on these rigths that you so easily dismiss? \n\n \n Whilst you casually ignore all the Empires that were great that didn't use it. Assyria, Babylonia, Egypt, the Asanti, the Muslim Empire, Mongolia, Japan, Germany/prussia. All empires have their time, and they fall for a variety of reasons.\n \n You assuming they are successful becaues of rights and falling because of rights is as bad as what right-wingers say about family values leading tothe collapose of civilization.\n \n \n\n do you really think it is another coincidence that in all 3 cases the empires in question began to decline when they moved away from a system of rights based ethics?\n\n \n It's largely post hoc, ergo propter hoc. Rome falied because of \n \n 1. Internal conflict (political)\n 2. Economic policy\n 3. Barbarian invasions\n 4. Disease\n 5. Christianity\n 6. War costs\n 7. Military degeneration\n 8. Failing alliances\n 9. No more war booty.\n 10. Poor line of succession\n 11. Civil War.\n 12. Overexpansion\n \n \n England failed also because of\n \n 1. Economics\n 2. War\n 3. Loss of faith in leadership\n \n The USA has yet to fall. It will,and it will, as history has show, fall to war, disease, famine, economics.\n \n \n \n Certainly your seatbelt keeps you harnessed to your seat (that is pretty much the point. When you are driving fast, do you have a problem with levitating out of your seat? Have you ever actually swerved hard enough to be thrown out of your seat?\n\n \n Yes. I have. I have had to make sharp turns to avoid deers before, and had I not been wearing my steatbelt, and had the people not been wearing it in back of me, when I hit it, they would have flown forward hitting me, my passanger, or the front window due to the laws of physics.\n \n Libertarians seem not to understand this. I don't speed, so i haven't a problem with \"levetating\" but you do bounce a lot, depending on road quality, road conditions, car type.\n \n Side impacts are a problem for seatbelts, however.\n \n \n I have done some pretty crazy driving, and I have never swerved hard enough to be thrown out of my seat. I have even been going down the road, without a seat belt, jerked the emergency brake, and thrown a 360, and that was not enough to knock me out of the seat. Not even close.\n\n \n Again, no one can prove that, but studies have shown what happens (in scientific labs) when cars going 50 hit wall, tree, poll. Dummy goes weeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeee weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee kersplat. It has also been shown that peole have been flung out of their cars like, as Mr. Wong pointed out, Meat Missiles.\n \n \n Also, how is the driver wearing his set belt going to keep other poeple from being thrown about the car (you must have some VERY light friends to be worried about this).\n\n \n More control = more car stablility. Optimally, they should aslo be wearing seatbelts to prevent unnecessary moving.\n \n \n \n and yet it has NEVER happened. People have been waiting for this for YEARS. Somebody being ejected from the vehicle and killing somebody else. It simply isn't reality. It is a farce.\n \n\n \n People have been ejected, They are lucky they haven't hit anyone or anything important. Lets not allow them to have that chance. It's worth it. Reality isn't Rights, either, but people use them, so lets not delve into what we think about reality. \n \n \n Have you ever held a dead child? Have you ever loaded a dead child into a body bag? If you ever do, you will understand. My position in that regard is completely irrational and I andmit it freely.\n\n \n The problem is, it's not irrational. It's perfectly an ethical consideration based on cost/benefit analysis. How much is it hurting you and others to see this? How much damage is it doing to the families and the lives? A lot.\n \n \n I have seen kids burned to death, I have seen them killed by mortars, grenades, bombs, I have seen them as bloody messes after car wrecks.\n\n \n I understand it now. You are military. You are used to not having to make critical ethical decisions. It's not your job. You are also traumatized by mass death and mutilations.\n \n \n The other day I ran a call and put a beautiful 2 yr old girl in a body bag because her mother beat her to death. She had a 4 yr old sister who watched the whole thing. She said \"Momma put us in our room and told us to be quite because she had a fight with her boyfiriend. she (the little sister) kept crying so mom kept coming in and hitting her on the head. She did this a lot and then she didn't cry any more but she didn't move either.\"\n\n \n Yes. That is immoral for the sole reason of how much unnessary, early pain and suffering that causes. It's not Utilitarian. Imagine what that kid will be like in the future.\n \n \n It is absolutly contradictory to most of my political ideals, but every time I close my eyes there are dead children waiting there, children who almost always died horrible, painful deaths. Dead children are different from dead adults. Until you have held one, you cannot possibly understand how huge that difference is, and I hope to god that you never do because it will haunt you for the rest of your life.\n \n\n \n That's why the deontological and Utilitarian arguments are stronger than the RIghts argument. Rights are largely nonsense fabrications that tend to produce utility on average.\n \n \n That is actually why I am posting huge, multi page posts here. It helps keep my mind off of unpleasantness, and when it is that fresh in my mind, if I start thinking about it, I cannot stop, and eventually I will go hide in my office and cry, adn once I start, I cannot stop. I am way too loopy to go in to work (several days without sleep will do that to even the most hardened insomniac) so you are getting the brunt of my nervous energy, and the benifit of seeing me ramble on like a lunatic. Unfortunatly, soldiers and paramedics do not get the benifit of clinical detachment that doctors get. They are out there in the ****, and it is all over them, and there is nothing clinical about it.\n\n \n Even though this is all anecdotal evidence: no medic should have to see that unnecessarily when it can be avoided. It's not ethical. Everyone's happiness considerations must factor it. Everyone's emotional and physical damage.\n \n \n But basic physics also tells us they will continue in the same diresction in shich they were traveling, shich means they will hit the back of the seat, not the driver, who also (basic physics tells us) will have continued in the same direction, and thus be saved from ebing struck by the passenger.\n\n \n Passangers in the back have been ejected if not wearing seatbelts. THey can go right over the seat into the front lap of the person and right out of the window.\n \n \n Teh jury system is one of citizen justice that has proven itself time and again. It is one of the checks in our system of checks and balances and a safegaurd aganst tyranny. It gives people the ability to choose what kind of nation they wish to live in.\n \n\n \n It also could be far more efficient and objective. That's better IMO. People aren't reliable enough without training. This is one reason why so many people are suseptible to shifty lawyer tactics. They aren't educated enough in law.\n \n \n But if you do away with juries as you suggested above, no matter how good your lawyer is, you have no protection against getting screwed. Without being tried by a jury of your peers, there are no gaurantees of justice. People in Nazi germany had a right to an attorney, it didn't do them a whole lot of good.\n \n\n \n I don't support getting rid of juries. That's a strawman. I said I want to replace them with more educated, law professionals who are chosen. That's not nearly the same as doing away with them.\n \n A jury of your peers reallyd oesn't do anything, especially when you look at the average intelligence and expertise of the juror.\n \n \n Money spent on such services has absolutly no positive net balance for your economy. That is the problem with a service based economy (and why ournation has virtually bankrupted itself and has resorted to fighting wars and multi trillion dollar social programs to keep our GDP up). You are either creating tangible value, which brings wealth into the country, or you are not. All service based economies do is shuffle money around. You could just give your lawyer the same amount of money for no services rendered and it would have the same effect on the economy, which is zero.\n \n\n \n Profit motive makes better lawyers. The benefit isn't in the economcis, but in the happiness and safety of the people. That's why the utility calculation works this out.\n \n \n \n Even when the \"lives saved\" are such a small overall number as to be negligeble? Even at that, they are purely theoretical. Those supportive of the \"war on terror\" are using the same argument as you, and thiers is no more theoretical than your.\n \n\n \n 6-19k per year isn't minute enough if it's easily preventible. Fewer people die in war than die in automobile accidents, and it costs less to help them. People get huffy over a few thousand people dying 1 time in a building, yet they are silly enough to let thousands die. It's not responsible.\n \n \n Correct, it is all a binch of hooplah, just like seat belts. BUT, we will sit here and argue abotu it like XXXXXX basically because we are told that it is somehow important despite the fact that from a statistical standpoint, deaths from car wrecks and deaths from guns simply don't happen.\n\n \n I can't prove a negative. I can only show what statics generally concurr on. That's the best you can do. And I have no reason not to trust them. I have had people tell me that the AAA the APA and the APA* aren't credible or they doin't believe in mainstream. \n \n It becomes debate-pointless becuse people don't accept credible mainstream sources and they have a standard of proof that's logically unattainable.\n \n \n \n This si the problem. NO, you won't, unless you define serious or medium accident as one where sombody dies (in which case you are stacking the numbers). In reality, most serious or moderate accidents do not result in a fatality. It takes a major, traumatic incident to kill a person. It is simply not that easy to do.\n \n\n \n Deaths aren't the only problems. Injury as well is a problem and the costs paid by corporations to pay for them. If there's a measure which can decrease it, I think it's worth it. \n \n \n \n \n It takes me nearly a full minute to buckle in my two children. If you just average us, you 8 seconds a trip, me 2 minutes, 6 seconds per trip, the numbers are obviously heavily weighted in your favor.\n \n Itme in the car is not wasted. It is transport time. You should be moving, that is an industrious activity.\n \n\n \n The time wasted is heavily deceiving. People waste more time going to the bathroom, brushing their teeth, or cleaning their toilets. Time spent is a fact and it ought to be used, especially if it has the potential to save you and your family, which is the general mainstream concensus.\n \n \n BUTm they are both entierly utilitarian. From a practical standpoint, taking absolute control of a nation, and ensuring that EVERYBODY is working together in for the good of the nation, ensuring there is not corporate squabbling and no energy wasted on one uppsmanship SHOULD yield a highly productive society. It just didn't work out this way.\n\n \n Utilitarian in concept, but not in reality. Someone can slap the name Utility on something but have it not actually be utilitarian. Communism doesn't have the positive consequences to be considered Utilitarian success. That's the idea.\n \n In Utilitarian ethics, nothing but the Conseqences of a situation or act matter--nothing. Intention is irrelevant.\n \n If you take full control of a nation and take away all imaginary rights, people become too unhappy. Full government control of resources and business makes the economy go to hell and it destroys profit motive and decreases economic success and inovation. The welfare state doesn't work.\n \n Competition always makes better material products and prices, and it has always beaten extreme socialism and communism.\n \n \n It doesn't work becaues human nature isn't like what Communism Predicts it should be. That's why it's a failed Political system. SOME ideals of Communism are good, but they don't work, so they aren't good. Their intentions are irrelevant. The result is what matters.\n \n Once it fails, its no longer Utilitarian. This is the prime difference. Do you know that under Communism/Marxism, one of the goals is to have all children sent to boarding schools? Do you know how insane that is? How many problems that would cause?\n \n That's hardly Utilitarian.\n \n \n Assmonkey....I like that. You are missing the point. These folks all BELIEVED they were acting in the best interest of the people.\n\n \n I understand the point. They believed they were being Ethical and Utilitarian, but in reality they weren't. Under Utilitarianism, motive and intent don't matter. Only the end result matters and you try to estimate.\n \n \n Nobody has ever endeavored to run a utilitarianistic system and halfway intot he project realised that they were really turning things into a massive cluster **** and reversed course. Nobody has veer started removing rights form their people then realised halfway through thay they were turning into a tyranical XXXXXXXX and backed off. It is almost always years later that everybody steps back and goes \"WPW. that was a bad idea\". In light of that, I think we should just stay away from such setups all togetehr. We have never seen a case where it has suceded, it has ALWAYS failed. No matter how many times you hit yourself int he head with a hammer, it is always going to hurt, and always going to leave a bruise\n\n \n Many people like to make the big old black/white. Society--every major western society--is already Utilitarian. One ethical system cannot cover everything. Rights  are  Utilitarian, even though they aren't intrinsic to the theory.\n \n Every society is also Deontological and Rights based. It's a mix, but the overall theory is Utility, but utilty has many forms.\n \n \n Stalin had an excellent solution for this. Those who failed to think collectively or deliberatly propogate lies that were in contrast tot eh obvious truths of socialism were simply killed. Simple, effective, quick. Orwell called it \"thought crime\".\n\n \n This is where technocratic ideals come into play to aid Utility. We need better educated, more objective boards to aid in government. The government should be subdivided into advisory councils elected from the major institutions.\n \n We need objective people to evaluate ideas in a common market. Once these ideas have failed, they ought to be tossed out and the person should not be allowed to propagate it further unless new evidence can be brought to bear.\n \n \n You are really going to have to expalin to me how this was any different at all from stalins rational in killing all those million of folks. I honestly cannot even see s aslight enough difference to address it.\n \n\n \n You don't kill anyone. That's stalin's mistake. He also didn't have objective thinkers advising him. He had cronies who only wanted to appease him out of fear. I am not pro-dictatorship. I think power to advice should be given to Technocratic Councils, elected from the prominent instituations of Objective Thought. There is no \"scientific agenda.\" Its one of the few professions which is highly objective and has excellent logical/analytical training.\n \n Logicians should also be present, and economists. These people collectively evaluate ideas proposed before them in the traditional peer reviewed journals.\n \n \n \n OH, yes they were. Most people in soviet russia thought the system was great. Those who didn't were killed or tossed in the gulag.....where they were eventually killed.\n\n \n Which was many millions of people. Stalin was responsible for millions of deaths of people who didn't agree with him, and the terrorized others with the secrete police to shut up.\n \n \n In relation to the seatbelt idea, another reason you want to save as many lives as possible, especially children, is the benefit (as long as possible) they can provide to society. You have to do a marginal analysis. You pump tons of cash into the education of children and building of their opportunities. You pay lots of money for awareness programs, you invest your time, your effort into their well-being so they develop into happy, healthy adults. \n \n It incurs negatie utility to not see to it that they remain safe and live a fruitful life. Your investment goes to an early waste.\n \n As many ethicists have mentioned, children go through millions of dollars in food, clothing, money and education, and this is prior to even entering the work world. They contribute little or nothing. To have them die or to have their parents die too early before they can offset the costs and contribute collectively is not a good tradeoff.\n \n As to your commet that there's no point in saving lifes, because we all die anyway, that [B] is [B] a form of Nihilism, and if we lead to the logical conclusion, there's no point in awarness or trying to save people or postpone death. If we stopped, we would be incurring an even greater early economic hardship on businesses.\n \n The manhours you think are wasted (even though they are't), since they are very few and unnoticable during a day's time also go to saving many more manhours and time for society. People wear their seatbelts and don't get injured don't take up valuable time, and whether you want to believe the facts or not, evidence points to the number of people being saved from death or injury to exceed the limits of a small to medium sized town.",
