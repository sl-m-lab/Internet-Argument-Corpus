   "At the law seminar in Reno during the 2002 National Rifle Association annual convention, I learned about other ways women can grab guns. In the midst of these carefully paced presentations, I first heard about the legal problems gun owners confronted when faced with domestic-violence restrictions. Under the terms of certain restraining orders, ownership of guns is prohibited. Domestic violence and divorce set in motion a range of state and federal statutes and laws aimed at disarming violent or potentially violent intimate partners. The 1996 Lautenberg Amendment that followed passage of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act made it a federal crime to possess a firearm while subject to a restraining order or after a misdemeanor conviction of the crime of domestic violence. \n \n No one at the law seminar lingered on why there was domestic violence in the United States, or how this violence affected men, women and children, or what steps could be taken to reduce or prevent such violence. For many of the lawyers present, it was strictly a legal issue about due process, federal statutes and legal precedents. What happened in the living room or bedroom, likely sites of what crime analysts called simple assault, was off the political and rhetorical radar screens. I also heard no discussion on how to protect women from men in their own homes. No, the subject was about individuals convicted of misdemeanors or slapped with restraining orders who had lost their right to own firearms. And the big issue was how to get them back. It was all about the guns. \n \n I found out that the police were particularly vulnerable. There was mention of how the Minneapolis Police Department was practically disarmed because so many police had present or past restraining orders against them. No one talked about domestic violence, because violence in the home didn't have the emotional punch of a violent predator breaking into your home. Then the homeowner was a hero defending his property, not a villain beating up on his spouse. The vigilante gun owner could hang a sign in his window announcing \"Warning, Trespassers will be shot. Survivors will be shot again.\" But what kind of sign could the battered wife hang up? \n \n In 2005, Ted Nugent, in his keynote address to the NRA annual meeting in Houston, could rant about plugging all the bad guys: \"I want 'em dead.\" But what if the cop or the soldier or the storeowner was the bad guy? Cops were a touchy subject in gun-rights circles. Some police organizations wanted exceptions made for officers under restraining orders, which would make it more difficult for them to lose their firearms. Other cops wanted \"law enforcement persons\" held to a \"higher standard, not a different standard.\" In 1997, Ronald Hampton, the executive director of the National Black Police Association, testified before the House Subcommittee on Crime. He spoke against exempting police officers. According to other testimony, police and military personnel were implicated in the crime of domestic violence at higher rates than were the general population. \n \n In 1998, the National Institute for Justice reported that each year 1.5 million women were raped or physically assaulted by intimate partners. Many of these attacks occurred in the privacy of the home. Men were more likely to be attacked by strangers. In contrast, women were seven to 14 times \"more likely to report that an intimate partner beat them up, choked or tried to drown them, threatened them with a gun, or actually used a gun on them.\" \n \n As a woman at gun shows, I am usually pitched specific guns to ward off the predator breaking into my house or stalking me. At a gun show in the state of Washington, I spent time talking with an arms manufacturer who specialized in variations of the AR-15, originally made by Colt. This marketing specialist at the booth told me that the AR-15 could be adapted for home defense. I could put in a short barrel, less than 16 inches long -- what cops used in closed spaces to shoot the bad guys. He warned me that he couldn't put the short barrel in the gun receiver because he would be breaking the law. No barrel under 16 inches can go into the gun frame. Instead, he held it about a half-inch from the gun frame and demonstrated how it would work. It was an impressive-looking weapon. Stocky and mean, a dull black. \n \n Only once do I remember a salesman trying to sell me a gun to shoot my husband or boyfriend if he turned abusive. . . . Still, I was having a hard time understanding how teams of lawyers for the National Rifle Association and other gun groups were ready to defend men under restraining orders. Maybe I just wasn't listening right. \n \n At one point a question came up about Attorney General John Ashcroft and his push in the Department of Justice to accept the Second Amendment as an individual right to own guns. We were told that the Emerson case would determine whether Ashcroft's position would hold. Over the next couple of years, everywhere I turned in the gun-rights world the Emerson case was heralded as a great Second Amendment victory. Second Amendment activists would hand me copies of the complete legal ruling in paperback form. It was the greatest news to hit the gun lobby in years. \n \n It came down to this: In 1998, the wife of Timothy Joe Emerson filed for divorce and applied for a restraining order against her husband. At a hearing, Sacha Emerson alleged that her husband made a threat over the telephone. He threatened to kill her \"friend.\" The restraining order was granted. Later, her husband was indicted for \"possession of a firearm while being under a restraining order.\" But, in a Texas federal district court, this indictment was dismissed by Judge Sam Cummings. In a memorandum brimming with colonial history, the Second Amendment reared its righteous head. Cummings argued that the federal actions to protect women against intimate partner violence didn't hold up against the struggles of our revolutionary fathers to found a nation with arms. \n \n The government appealed to the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals, which upheld the indictment against the husband. Emerson's attorneys argued there were insufficient judicial findings that he was a \"credible threat\"; the 5th Circuit Court disagreed. Two of the three judges accepted the argument that while the Second Amendment gave an individual a right to own a gun, it did not give an individual under a restraining order the right to own a gun. This was especially true, the court found, since upon purchasing a Beretta semiautomatic pistol, the husband had signed a BATF Form 4473, stating that \"so long as he was under a court order such as that of Sept. 14, 1998, federal law prohibited his continued possession of that weapon.\" The third judge on the court \"chose not to join\" in the lengthy individual rights argument because they were \"dicta\" and \"at best an advisory treatise on this long-running debate\" and really had nothing to do with the decision made by the court. He went on to say that if the Second Amendment was interpreted as an individual and not a collective right, in a way, who cares? There would still be legal grounds for \"reasonable restriction\" on gun ownership. \n \n Was Sacha Emerson just another gun-grabbing wife? In reading the opinion of the 5th Circuit Court, I wondered, because most of the opinion was not about the restraining order at all. That question was settled in a concise statement by the judges. Supported by amicus curiae submitted by the NRA, the Second Amendment Foundation, the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, and the Texas State Rifle Association, two of the three federal judges had used the opinion to expound for more than 50 pages about how the Second Amendment protected individual rights. . . . Who cared if some frightened wife in Texas was worried enough to get a restraining order? She was probably overreacting. She didn't need protection; his gun did. \n \n In the end the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear any further appeals. Gun rights activists would have to wait. I wonder how Sacha Emerson reacted to this court drama. \n \n Joan Burbick will make a presentation of her book \"Gun Show Nation: Gun Culture and American Democracy\" at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at Town Hall Seattle, 1119 8th Ave. The event is sponsored by Elliott Bay Book and Center for Civic Life.

   "So the clever woman who had no control over marrying the large stupid uncivil man is now completely at his mercy and requires the gubment to save her? Is this one stupid uncivil man cause for an entire nation to be divested of constitutional rights? Curious indeed. If clever independent woman learns how to shoot that cute little pistol, large stupid uncivil man would have a small cute entrance wound center of mass to contend with. And don't tell me a woman is not strong enough to handle a firearm. You might as well perpetuate the myth that women just can't figure out math or science or compete in the workplace, or vote, etc etc etc. \n \n Just how fragile are women, and what other protective measures must be taken to protect them from the world? I believe this system of thought was tried in the past and found to be antiquated. Should we as a society return to the view that women must be sheltered and protected lest a stray sunbeam alight their alabaster skin? I would like to properly advise my hockey-playing daughter. Neither she nor I subscribe to your picture of helpless victimhood.",

   "So guns are more important than the safety of women? Then the right of women abandoned by their husbands to know about the financial situation of their spouses in a divorce case?\n\n \n I would agree with you, but first of all, the owner of the show has every right to not allow cameras. Second, it would be a huge invasion of privacy if all women knew what their ex wives could keep spying on what they buy and what they do. They have no buisness doing that.\n \n \n \n \n \nSo men love their guns more than women? Is that some kind of homosexuality? Ya know a gun is kind of shaped like, um, you know what. A gun does ejaculate in a sense.\n\n \n Very funny, but just because men don't want their rights violated by nosy ex wives and their lawyers and PIs, does not mean that they love their guns any more than they do women. Its simply a hobby. Men don't insist on following women around, watching everything they buy and everything they do, do they? Men are entitled to guns just as women are entitled to manicures. Our rights are going out the window fast.",

   "It's a good article as far as propaganda goes. I particularly like the graphic included with the web article of the female target silhouette covered in blood spatter. It helped set the tone for the printed invective that followed it. I think we are giving the article more credit than it deserves by debating the \"alimony\" angle the article pushes. \n \n There is only one unnamed source listed for the alleged \"alimony\" claim. There is no way for the source to know who will attend the gun show in advance. Gun shows are not conferences where participants pre-register. But even if this show were to have some pre-registration form requirement to let the organizer know the identity of those attending, I doubt the form would have a box to check for you to list whether your alimony is being paid properly or not. It is all pure speculation, and it is patently obvious that the unnamed source has no foundation of knowledge to make such a claim. It is entirely possible that the source itself is a fabrication of the author. If it is real, then the author has chosen to use a source which even she must know has no credibility. Her presentation as true what is so patently false source, and her further use it to make a broad generalization about men and guns and alimony, only serves to render her own credibility suspect. \n \n Is the NRA biased against women and women's rights? As a rank and file member, I rather doubt it-but I can't pretend to act as the press spokesman for the organization. I would suggest that the question is one which could easily be put to the NRA's President, Sandra Froman. She would certainly qualify as a spokeswoman for the NRA's position. \n \n But I do know something about the issues raised in the article. I am a man, and I like to buy guns. I've been to a few gun shows in the past. I owe no alimony because I am still married, which is chiefly because my wife still puts up with me. Yet I have had some dealings with both men and women who refuse to pay support. Simone, my answers to the questions that you raise in post #3 are \"No,\" \"No,\" \"No,\" and \"No.\" If you want to talk about it more than this, then I'll gladly do so with you. I suspect I know a hell of a lot more than the article's author about domestic violence and protective orders and guns. \n \n --- \n \n \"Again, I learned a lot; especially that the rank and file are usually much more primitive than we imagine. Propaganda must therefore always be essentially simple and repetitious. In the long run only he will achieve basic results in influencing public opinion who is able to reduce problems to the simplest terms and who has the courage to keep forever repeating them in this simplified form despite the objections of the intellectuals.\" Paul Joseph Goebbels, The Goebbels Diaries, 1942-1943, edited and translated by Louis P. Lochner, Doubleday & Co, Inc. New York, 1948, at Page 56 (from a private diary entry dated January 29, 1942).\n \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, Lecture II, 1921.",
