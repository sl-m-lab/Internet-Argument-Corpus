   "While Ann Coulter has said some pretty over-the-top things from time to time, every now she hits the nail on the head squarely.\n \n This is one such case &#8230;\n \n \n\"In the 1970s, liberal ideas on crime swept the country. Gun owners were treated like criminals while actual criminals were coddled and released. If only we treated criminals with dignity and respect and showed them the system was fair, liberals told us, criminals would reward us with good behavior. \n \n As is now well known, crime exploded in the '70s. It took decades of conservative law-and-order policies to get crime back to near-1950s levels. \n \n It's similarly pointless to treat all Americans as if they're potential terrorists while trying to find and confiscate anything that could be used as a weapon. We can't search all passengers for explosives because Muslims stick explosives up their anuses. (Talk about jobs Americans just won't do.) \n \n You have to search for the terrorists. \n \n Fortunately, that's the one advantage we have in this war. In a lucky stroke, all the terrorists are swarthy, foreign-born, Muslim males. (Think: \"Guys Madonna would date.\") \n \n This would give us a major leg up -- if only the country weren't insane. \n \n Is there any question that we'd be looking for Swedes if the 9/11 terrorists, the shoe bomber, the diaper bomber and the printer cartridge bomber had all been Swedish? If the Irish Republican Army were bombing our planes, wouldn't we be looking for people with Irish surnames and an Irish appearance? \n \n Only because the terrorists are Muslims do we pretend not to notice who keeps trying to blow up our planes.\"\n Read more at Welcome to AnnCoulter.com",
