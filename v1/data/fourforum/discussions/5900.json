We're talking about same-sex marriage.\n\n \n More broadly, we're talking about same-sex relationships, and obviously too many of them are harmful. That's why the analogy is apt.\n \n \nLet me ask a better question: would you make it illegal for black people to own guns, but legal for white people to own them? Black people are more likely to use them for homicide, right? Wrong; only people in those subcultures are more likely to use them for homicide; most black people are caring people who would never murder anyone else.\n\n \n Depends, but most likely not. But there are curfews in all-black urban areas and more cops assigned to them. So it's not always bad to do the responsible thing and step in for one group who is doing something really bad, if it's bad enough. \n \n One could just as easily say that the rights of everyone have been damaged because of these crimes since gun laws are probably more restrictive than they would be otherwise. What I'm getting at is that to really apply your analogy, we would have to take it to it's logical conclusion that relationships everywhere should be discouraged just because gay peoples' relationships are more likely to involve an STD. After all, guns are already well-regulated for EVERYONE, black or white. So I don't really think gun ownership is an apt analogy.\n \n \nDon't do your best to assure that gay people engaging in unsafe sex continue it. Treat them as you treat yourself, and give them every advantage you give yourself.\n\n \n Of course we shouldn't assure them they should continue it. If anything, we should make sure they don't. After all, if someone drives a car unsafely, we don't let them keep driving just because everyone else can.

   "More broadly, we're talking about same-sex relationships, and obviously too many of them are harmful. That's why the analogy is apt.\n\n \n Too many? You mean a small minority of them? You might as well have just stated that \"obviously too many African Americans are harmful.\"\n \n \nDepends, but most likely not. But there are curfews in all-black urban areas and more cops assigned to them. So it's not always bad to do the responsible thing and step in for one group who is doing something really bad, if it's bad enough.\n\n \n That's right, we step in where necessary. I have no problem with the government adding additional regulations on all people in an area with a problem. But we certainly don't look at the situation and say, \"Okay, there are lots of gangs in here with black members. Every black person everywhere should have additional rules and regulations placed on them.\" It isn't every black person that is causing the problem.\n \n \nOne could just as easily say that the rights of everyone have been damaged because of these crimes since gun laws are probably more restrictive than they would be otherwise. What I'm getting at is that to really apply your analogy, we would have to take it to it's logical conclusion that relationships everywhere should be discouraged just because gay peoples' relationships are more likely to involve an STD. After all, guns are already well-regulated for EVERYONE, black or white. So I don't really think gun ownership is an apt analogy.\n\n \n But my logical conclusion isn't that we should discourage relationships, it's that we should discourage unsafe sex. And I absolutely do think it's a good idea to encourage safe sex. In fact, I'd argue that we already do it for straight people more than we do for gay people because of marriage. So the logical conclusion is to continue promoting safe sex, which we are doing, and to encourage safe sex among same-sex couples by legalizing same-sex marriage. Your conclusion appears to be to punish same-sex couples who are actually engaging safe sex by denying them the same rights as opposite-sex couples. I don't see how that could be the proper conclusion at all.\n \n \nOf course we shouldn't assure them they should continue it. If anything, we should make sure they don't. After all, if someone drives a car unsafely, we don't let them keep driving just because everyone else can. Nor do we ensure cars are made just for their driving style, and widen the roads so they can be accomodated. We don't set up Unsafe-Driver's-Rights-Organzations, or allow unsafe drivers to invoke the 14th Amendment (liberty)as reason they should be able to drive. No, we take their license away and discourage that behavior. I don't think we should outlaw gay relationships at all, but I also don't think we should give them official status of marriage. Find other ways to give them the benefits they need. And by all encourage them not to drive, er . . . have relationships, if they can't do it safely. Or at LEAST teach them to do it safely.\n\n \n But if we find that a lot of African Americans are driving cars unsafely, we don't strip the right of all African Americans to drive cars. We target those people individually; we know that the majority of African Americans drive just as safely as anyone else. If we know that more African Americans use firearms to commit homicide, we don't give all African Americans everywhere less rights, we target the individuals who are causing the problem.\n \n But your conclusion is the equivalent of punishing all African Americans everywhere. Your logic states that since more gay people get STD's than straight people, we should punish gay people everywhere. It ignores the fact that most gay people don't get STD's. So I could say, \"since more black people commit homicides, we should punish black people everywhere.\" And that is simply morally wrong.\n \n Perhaps what I need to point out is that most black people are no more likely to commit homicide than any white person. Each black person is an individual, and even though blacks commit murder at a higher rate, the vast majority would never dream of committing murder. In the same fashion, each gay person is an individual, and most would not engage in unsafe sex.\n \n If you want to prevent homicide, target the individuals who commit it, and if you want to prevent STD's, target the individuals who spread them. Don't blanket groups of people among whom only a small minority are causing the problem.",

The government doesn't offer up blanket denials of rights to classes of people because of their propensity to have a disease. It's preposterous. STD's and promiscuous behavior are neither inherent to homosexuality nor exclusive to it. The risk of a member of the 97% heterosexual percentage of the population becoming infected with an STD by the tiny percent of the remaining 3% of the population that is gay and STD-infected is microscopic -- and for those straights who don't have sex with gay men at all, it's nil.

I have engaged in both homosexual and heterosexual relations, and I can assure you that they are pretty much the same thing.\n \n Anyhow, certainly monogamy has been an option in the past, and it is the most widely-used option by homosexuals, as expected. And I don't expect marriage to make people monogamous all of a sudden. But legalizing same-sex marriage is part of a process that will teach young homosexuals that they have as much a place in society as anyone else; it'll raise them with the idea that when you grow up, you meet the person you love and marry that person, whether you're gay or straight.\n \n Gay has nothing to do with unsafe sex. The reason certain gay communities exist where unsafe sex is prevelant is because those people don't believe that society is looking out for their best interest. I don't expect the average, already-monogamous gay person to suddenly become more monogamous, and I don't expect every gay person to instantly become monogamous, but if same-sex marriage is legalized, I expect those unsafe gay communities to dwindle over time.\n \n \nIt may not be directly harmful, but because it's done it perpetuates other gay relationships which are sometimes not done with protection or are done between unsafe couples.

And it's the attitude some have that it's not a bad enough problem (as some here have) to really do something about that prevents more lives from being saved.\n\n \n In fact most members of the gay community will never be exposed to AIDS. I don't know anyone who has it. I'm not going to have sex with anyone who has it or whose status I'm uncertain of. You're referring only to certain subcommunities within the gay community. You're just generalizing the behaviors of the few across all gay people; it's the same thing as generalizing black people as killers because they have a higher rate of homicide. In fact, most black people will never handle a gun and never commit murder, but because some subcommunties of black people have higher homicide rates, would you be willing to use those statistics to generalize that across all black people? To do so is absurdity.\n \n Now, I want to attack the problem of AIDS as much as anyone else. But to do that, we shouldn't start out by punishing monogamous gay people. We should start by rewarding them. We should continue by targetting unsafe gay communities and doing what we can to end them, in the same fashion that we would target gangs and do what we can to end them.\n \n \nSure they are.

   "How do you know this? Everything I see points to gay men having the highest rates of HIV, by a landslide. Some are even \"bugchasers.\" Obviously there's an epidemic. Is there proof that most gay sex is safe mongamous?\n\n \n Well, we can take a look at the numbers of people with STD compared to the estimated number of homosexuals. We can examine the number of same-sex civil unions and marriages in existence. We can ask the people on these forums. Or you can go talk to people in gay rights organizations for yourself. I don't have links for you with numbers to look at, but they're available if anyone is interested.\n \n \nAgain, can you prove this?\n\n \n Do I really need to? Isn't it enough to know that you are punishing the people who behave in a safe fashion? Even if not a single gay person behaved monogamously, it would still make absolutely no sense to stop promoting monogamy by denying marriage.\n \n \nBlaming society hasn't helped as that's been the strategy thus far. At some point the gay community needs to take responsibility for itself.\n\n \n Don't write off a logical explanation of the situation as \"blaming society.\" Did I ever once say society is to blame? I said that those individuals don't believe in following society, if I'm not mistaken, which places the blame on the individuals who engage in unsafe sex, if anyone, not on society. Be careful that you are not so desperate to see your opponents blaming society that you find it in places where it never happened.\n \n Opponents of gay rights blame gays as a whole, supporters of gay rights blame society as a whole, but I personally don't care who is to blame. I did not intend to point any fingers, I intended to analyze the cause of the problem and present a reasonable solution. In this case, legalizing same-sex marriage will help prevent the spread of STD's, and that is all that matters regarding STD's.\n \n \nYou keep referring to it as a \"subculture\" or \"subcommunity\" but apparently the problem is pretty widespread.\n\n \n Oh is that so? Well, I guess my gay friends will all soon be infected then? No, I really doubt it. The problem exists because there are many subcultures of gay people who perpetuate it. It is \"widespread\" in the sense that there are such subcultures in most major cities. In the same sense, the problem of gangs is widespread. That doesn't mean that the average black person knows anyone in a gang or is going to date anyone in a gang.\n \n \nNo, it's more like saying unsafe drivers should start taking responsibility. It's not good enough to say that the \"subculture\" of those unsafe drivers who actually have had wrecks should be the only ones to worry about.\n\n \n People who engage in unsafe sex should start taking responsibility. So why don't you stop blaming people who have gay sex and start blaming people who engage in unsafe sex? You're putting the blame squarely on me and people like me. What have I done to deserve your wrath, your punishment? Not only do I engage in every safe sex practice I can, I speak out in support of safe sex, I reprimand my friends who don't engage in safe sex, and I try to discourage my friends, both gay and straight, from having casual sex. Instead of punishing people who engage in unsafe sex practices, you've decided that I'm the one who deserves punishment. You've decided to punish every monogamous gay person for the actions of other, promiscuous gay people. Well that just doesn't make any sense at all.\n \n If women are more often bad drivers, we don't punish good women drivers by proxy. How about you target unsafe drivers instead of punishing the good ones?\n \n \nIf STD's are being spread in the gay community, you should start by looking at the gay community. Stop trying to blame everyone else other than where the blame lies. People are responsible for their actions.\n\n \n I know I already said it, but you need to stop claiming that I'm blaming other people. You're the one blaming people who don't deserve it. You're the one claiming that I'm somehow the cause of STD's simply by being part of the gay community. The truth is, if gangs are commiting homicide, we don't start by looking at the black community, we start by looking at gang communities. Just because the majority of people in gangs are black does not mean that the average black person has anything to do with a gang. You're putting all gay people in the same bucket, when realistically, they're nothing alike. Target the group that is causing the problem, but don't blanket people unrelated to the problem into that group.\n \n \nAnd regarding the compassion issue, if it weren't for the work of religious organizations and the fact that there is religious culture in this country that emphasizes monogamy (in correct marriages of course) and always has, HIV would be a bigger problem than it is today. The religious stance that knows gay sex has too much capacity for danger and emphasizes sex the way humans are designed/evolved to do it (opposite-gender) IS the compassionate stance. It's the gay rights industry telling gay people 'do what you want and damn society' and blaming society instead of working to help gay men that are the ones being uncompassionate. They should be ashamed.\n\n \n How can you say gay rights organizations aren't trying to help gay people? They aren't saying \"Do whatever you want and damn society\", they're saying \"It's okay to be gay, despite what society says, but practice safe sex.\" They're the only ones working to prevent AIDS. How many religious organizations do you see doing that? Maybe they're out there in a larger force than I realize, but the only ones I've ever heard of working to preventing AIDS are those that are gay-friendly. Churches opposed to gay rights don't care about gay people, they care about stopping people from being gay, no matter how horrible that makes their lives.\n \n Churches opposed to gay rights are looking for any reason to strip people's right to be gay, and they're looking for any reason to elevate themselves above gay people. It doesn't matter to them that some gay people practice safe sex because to them, safe gay sex is just as bad as unsafe sex. They want people to stop being gay, and that's led them to demonize every gay person, every person whose beliefs lead them to live differently than the church approves of. But that sort of thinking is wrong.",

They want people to stop being gay, and that's led them to demonize every gay person, every person whose beliefs lead them to live differently than the church approves of\n\n \n You have a very low view of churches it seems, since most don't see gay rights in your light. Your view of churches is unrealistic in many cases, and in saying that sort of thing, you are commiting the very same offenses toward church members that you take offense to when people demonize gay people. I've said this before, but most churches, even those you would consider \"anti-gay\", don't really even spend that much time on gay issues. I've been in a lot of churches, plenty of them would be considered fundie, and I've never heard a SINGLE sermon against gay people. Not one. It seems that the idea the church is actively at war or oppressing gay people is pretty exagerrated. There are exceptions of course: Jerry Falwell for one. And there's the hateful outfit that Fred Phelps runs (that I wouldn't really call a church in the Christian sense anyway). But most people and churches who aren't for gay marriage don't hate you and don't actively demonize you at all.",

   "Hm, misleading title on the page then. A further reading shows that just under half of the new cases are from IV or Heterosexual activity. That still means half of the cases are from homosexual activity, still unexplainable.\n\n \n No it doesn't mean that at all. Your reading comp is weak. If 1/3 come from heterosexual activity then the other 2/3 came from either IV drug use, homosexuality activity, blood transfusions, mother to child, or one of the other ways that it can be passed. You don't seem to know much about the disease and how it is passed.\n \n \n \n\n Irrelevent, inflamatory, and likely statistically insignificant. Of course, such a result would only skew the results further against homosexuality. I doubt there were any straight men pretending to be gay in this survey.\n\n \n No, there are men who claim they are straight, but are having same gender sex. It is a thing called the DL or the Down Low. These are men who say they are not gay, but are having gay sex. The difference they claim is that it is all about sex with no emotional attraction. In all essence these men to not make up gay\n \n \n I also have to say, I agree with Jaxian. I don't know anyone who is HIV positive either. Why should i be out there anymore than a straight person fighting HIV/AIDS. I have the same moral obligation as jyoshu does to stop people from having unprotected sex. I don't know these people, I am not one of them. I have very safe sex. It is called monogamy.",

   "Social divisions - Sexuality\n In the early years of the epidemic, it seemed that HIV was something which predominantly affected gay men. Over the years since then, however, epidemiological patterns have gradually shifted - the majority of people currently living with HIV in America are still men who have sex with men, but in 2003, heterosexual transmission accounted for 31% of all newly-diagnosed AIDS cases - up from 3% in 198517.\n \n Men who have sex with men (MSM), however, are still at a high risk of HIV infection - in 2003 they accounted for an estimated 57% of AIDS cases amongst men and well over half of HIV diagnoses. Particularly at risk are younger MSM and MSM from racial minorities. Perhaps because their age means that they didn't see friends die in the early years of the epidemic, they are becoming increasingly complacent about practising safer sex, and remain at considerably higher risk of encountering a sexual partner who is HIV+ than members of any other group in America.\n \n Social divisions - Injecting Drug Users (IDUs)\n In addition to being seen as a 'disease of gay men', HIV has been assumed to be something which was a problem for people who injected drugs, as the early years of the epidemic saw many IDUs infected, and HIV can be easily transmitted via the sharing of infected injecting equipment. In 2003, 19% of women and 14% of men who were diagnosed HIV+ were injecting drug users who were assumed to have been infected as a result of their drug abuse18.\n \n Social divisions - Race\n Ever since the start of the epidemic in the USA, it has particularly affected racial and ethnic minorities. The demography of the epidemic has changed considerably over the last decade - from being previously an affliction of gay males, HIV has changed course, and, while gay men remain a high-risk group in America, it is now affecting disproportionate numbers of African Americans, especially women.\n \n Indeed, racial minority groups now represent almost three quarters of new AIDS cases. In 2003, African Americans accounted for 50% of all AIDS cases diagnosed during the year, even though they accounted for only 12% of the population. Among African American women, the figures are even more alarming - they represent up to 72% of all new HIV cases in American women. These high HIV figures suggest that in years to come, AIDS figures will be made up largely of African Americans.19\n \n http://www.avert.org/aids-america.htm",
