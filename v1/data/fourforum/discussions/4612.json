   "Not that I watch 60 Minutes a lot, but I did catch a story about Sea Gypsies who survived the tsunami because of their knowledge of its coming. These people are amazing.\n \n The ones on land went to higher ground. The ones at sea went to deeper water. They knew it was coming.\n \n They have no words equivalent to our \"hello\", \"goodby\", \"when\", \"want\" and several others.\n \n They move from island to island carrying no baggage. They swim before they walk. \n \n They see twice as good in sea water as we do. They slow their heart rates to stay underwater for great lengths ot time (compared to what we can do).\n \n Could they be evolving right in front of us?\n \n \n http://cbs11tv.com/localnews/topstories_story_079191529.html\n \n \n Sorry, I misspelled Moken.",

They likely came \"out of Africa\" along with the rest of us.\n \n I'm particularly interested in why they can see better underwater...and slow their heart rates at will.",

If we evolved as a semi-aquatic ape, then thebootfitter is right and we really have evolved away from these people by losing our ability to focus as well under water and to slow our heartrate as efficiently.",
